BEIJING 
The Chinese authorities appear to have lifted some of the restrictions that blocked Web sites for journalists working at the Olympic Village although other politically sensitive sites , including those on Tibet , remained inaccessible on Friday morning .
The government made no announcement about the partial lifting of its firewall , and it was unclear if the change was temporary .
The International Olympic Committee on Friday also sought to counter statements on Wednesday by one of its top press officials that suggested that I.O.C. negotiators had quietly acquiesced to the restrictions .
Giselle Davies , a spokeswoman for the organizing committee , said a misunderstanding had led to the contradictory versions of events , but she stressed that Olympic organizers have always been adamant about unfettered Internet access for the 20,000 foreign journalists who will be covering the athletic competition , which begins on Aug .
8 .
The loosening of restrictions , however limited , came after senior committee officials on Thursday spoke with Olympic organizers and urged them to reconsider their decision to maintain a ban on politically sensitive sites , which critics said violated previous pledges China had made to provide uncensored Internet access to reporters .

Testro -X Reviews - What Is It ?
Author : Eric Lander | Last Updated Date : 02.03.2020
WARNING : DO NOT BUY Testro - X Cuts Until You Read This Review !
Is it a Scam ?
Does It Really Work ?
Check Ingredients , Side Effects and More !
Testro-X is a testosterone booster manufactured by the company called Truth Nutraceuticals .
The company was co-founded in 2016 by Christopher Walker .
The Testro - X official website is not very informative in terms of the ingredients and side effects of the product .
It is said that the supplement sets itself apart from other products of the kind by helping your body to get a higher hormonal baseline , not by boosting your testosterone levels .
It uses clinically researched components to provide adaptogens that are expected to create a higher testosterone baseline inside the male body .
At present , the supplement costs $ 50 on the official website ( reduced from $ 68 ) .
There is a money - back guarantee .
Testro - X differs from other products of the kind with the fact that it does n't promise impressive and fast results promised by illegal steroids .
It contains proven ingredients , according to the manufacturer , that give a short - term increase of testosterone allow your body to increase the levels of testosterone in a natural way .
One of its major ingredients is Ashwagandha root extract , which is a heavily - researched adaptogen that decreases anxiety , cortisol levels , and inflammation .
This substance is also said to support a higher testosterone level baseline and improve physical performance .
Another ingredient , Magnesium , is claimed to be used in the optimum dosage , to improve the quality of your sleep and control your blood pressure while boosting free testosterone levels .
To better understand whether the product is really effective let us take a look at the other ingredients used in it .
We are also going to take a look at the real customers ' reviews .
Ingredients of Testro - X - Does It Really Work ?
Is It a Scam ?
Testro -X comes in the form of capsules .
The official website reports that the supplement includes the following ingredients : Magnesium ( as Magnesium Citrate ) 150mg , KSM - 66 Organic Ashwagandha Root Extract 400mg , Zinc ( as Zinc Gluconate ) 15 mg , Inositol 200mg , Forskohlii Root Extract 250mg , Glycine 200mg ( amino acid and neurotransmitter ) , Boron ( as Boron Citrate ) 10 mg , L - Theanine 100mg ( amino acid from green tea ) , Bioperine Black Pepper Fruit Extract 10mg , Coleus Forskholii Extract ( herb ) , Inositol ( molecule similar to glucose ) .
We summarized the available clinical evidence on WebMD and Examine about the ingredients of the product .
It is indicated that magnesium addresses different conditions , including indigestion , constipation , irregular heartbeat , and high blood pressure .
Two studies are listed showing that it could boost testosterone and improve sleep quality .
However , there is no evidence that Magnesium could really improve sexual function .
Zinc might also be effective for such conditions as osteoporosis , acne , diarrhea , age - related vision loss , bad breath , depression , and warts .
Five studies re listed related to testosterone ; however , only one referenced increased testosterone .
No other benefits reported on the Testro - X website are supported by clinical evidence .
The KSM - 66 is a proprietary ashwagandha extract that is claimed to have been clinically tested for relieving anxiety , stress and telomerase activity .
Examine referenced three studies for Ashwagandha 's effect on cortisol levels , stress and anxiety .
There is no evidence related to improved sexual performance , though .
Forskolin is often used in weight loss supplements , although WebMD said that there is insufficient evidence for anything else but a heart condition called idiopathic congestive cardiomyopathy .
No studies are mentioned for testosterone .
Inositol is listed by WebMD as " possibly effective " for obsessive - compulsive disorder ( OCD ) , panic disorder , polycystic ovary syndrome ( PCOS ) , psoriasis , and acute respiratory distress syndrome .
Examine listed fourteen studies related to PCOS , three for panic attacks , four for anxiety , and one for OCD symptoms .
The substance has nothing to do with increased testosterone levels .
Examine referenced some evidence for l- theanine 's anxiety and relaxation benefits .
At the same time , WebMD showed " insufficient evidence " for other benefits claimed by Testro - X manufacturer .
Boron is not associated with any benefits related to stress or testosterone , according to WebMD .
Examine contains three trials but state that the compound requires more robust trials and seems unreliable .
It is considered that Boron increases testosterone levels .
Black Pepper Extract is added to the product to improve supplement absorption and the bioavailability of its ingredients only .
Neither Examine nor WebMD listed any testosterone - boosting benefits for glycine .
Customer Reviews - Does It Have Any Side Effects ?
Even though the company behind Testro - X does n't mention any possible side effects of the product , they still may occur .
According to WebMD and Examine , magnesium contained in the supplement might cause nausea , stomach upset , diarrhea , and vomiting .
It can also interact with some muscle relaxers , antibiotics , and medications for high blood pressure .
Another ingredient , inositol can lead to headache , tiredness , nausea , and dizziness .
Theanine may be unsafe when used for long periods of time .
The product can be taken only by those who are 18 years and older .
It is a wise idea to consult a physician before using the supplement , especially if you have any medical condition .
There are numerous customer reviews on Testro - X's website , all of which are positive .
However , third - party websites contain not so positive testimonials .
Amazon gave the product an average rating of 3.1 stars with a total of 89 customer reviews .
Many of the complaints included ineffectiveness of the product , high risk of experiencing side effects and dishonest return policy .
We learned that the company ( The Better Foundation LLC ( DBA TruthNutra ) is based out of Melbourne Beach , FL .
It was n't listed with the Better Business Bureau at the time of our research .
Let us take a look at the real customers ' reviews on the supplement available online .
" I have been taking Testro - X for about two years , and I experienced side effects quite often .
When I took a day off of the recommended dose I suffered from awful Acid Reflux and anxiety which led to even more anxiety , mental and emotional upset .
Once I took a week off and had terrible symptoms .
That was the time when I understood that the product was not for me and I stopped using it "
" I decided to buy Testro X after reading positive reviews of the guys who had taken the supplement themselves .
It was a bad idea , since the product did not work for me at all .
I also faced the worst customer service in my practice of shopping online .
I tried to return the product , but they told me that they would not accept it .
And this test booster is too expensive .
I would never recommend it to anyone .
There are other products on the market that would work effectively "
" I have taken another supplement before but then I decided to give TestroX a try .
Unfortunately , I was disappointed .
I had not noticeable effect , neither positive nor negative .
Even after following the videos provided by the company , I did n't see that the product was effective for me .
This supplement is completely useless .
I did not like the company 's customer service too "
Where To Buy Testro-X ?
Testro -X is available in the following options .
One bottle ( 90 capsules ) costs $ 50 ( $ 45 through auto - refill ) , two bottles can be bought for $ 87 , while three bottles are available at the cost of $ 100 .
All orders come with free shipping within the USA .
The product can be also bought through Amazon , GNC and Walmart .
If you opt for the auto - refill , you will receive a new bottle of the product once per month and your credit card will be automatically charged $ 45 .
Officially , there is a 60 - day refund policy , but few customers succeeded to get their money back .
My Final Summary
Based on what is available about Testro - X , I can hardly recommend this supplement to usage .
Very little clinical evidence found on WebMD and Examine can indicate that some ingredients found in the formula could improve relaxation , increase testosterone and reduce anxiety .
At the same time , many of these ingredients can potentially be harmful for the human health and cause certain side effects and allergic reactions .
Since our bodies are different , individual results may vary a lot .
The product has a mixed online reputation and is a relatively expensive supplement .
Even though it comes with a 60 - day refund policy , the company does everything not to return the money to the customers .
With this in mind , I do n't think that Testro - X is worth buying .
Affordable Alternative
Many doctors consider that the problem can be well solved by another product known as Testogen .
I completely agree with them because I study many products of the kind !
I recommend you reading my review about Testogen .
You 'll be pleasantly surprised .

Political pundits , bloggers , campaign workers and political junkies everywhere have been trying to figure out exactly why John McCain made the unusual move on Wednesday to " suspend " his campaign until law makers in Washington figure out the bail - out plan , but despite all of the discussion there is really no mystery at all here .
The sole purpose of the " suspension " was to provide the McCain Campaign political cover for cancelling the Vice Presidential debate between Joe Biden and Sarah Palin next Thursday in St. Louis .
It did n’t work .
McCain ’s threats to not show up to tonight ’s presidential debate came along with a request to reschedule it for October 2 , the night of the VP debate .
While this piece of the story was basically reported as an after thought to McCain ’s " suspension " of his campaign , it was the primary focus of McCain ’s ploy .
And really , who can blame them for trying to stop it ?
The McCain Campaign seems to be realizing that Sarah Palin simply can not be allowed near a microphone , let alone near a microphone and Joe Biden at the same time .
Since becoming McCain ’s running mate , Palin has displayed just how shockingly clueless she is on a wide variety of issues .
She has also fumbled interviews , been called out for her repetitive lying and earlier today , progressive radio host , Ed Schultz , reported that the " McCain people are more than concerned about Palin . "
He also reported that staffers staged a mock debate and a mock press conference with Palin and that both were described as " disastrous . "
With Palin ’s track record so far , it is a pretty safe bet that allowing her on stage , in front of a huge television audience , next to Joe Biden , is not going to go well for the Governor from Alaska .
In fact , it will be just like the mock debate was for her , disastrous .
If I were a McCain strategist right now I would be making every effort possible to figure out a way to get Palin out of debating Biden on October 2 .
Whatever hit the McCain Campaign may take for bailing on or delaying the VP debate is going to be nothing compared to the hit they could potentially take from actually allowing it to go forward .
If things go well enough for Biden he could effectively end her political career next Thursday night - and by proxy that may pretty much end McCain ’s as well .
That is too great a risk for McCain or the Republican Party in general to take , so this week , do n’t be surprised when news breaks that Team McCain is trying to weasel their way out of the VP debates .
Palin raises $ 8 million — for Obama
Obama 's coffers have been filling since Sarah Palin attacked him repeatedly in St. Paul last night .
An Obama aide confirms Drudge 's report that Obama has raised about $ 8 million from more than 130,000 donors and is on pace to raise $ 10 million by the time McCain reaches the stage tonight .
UPDATE : Obama spokesman Bill Burton says , " Sarah Palin 's attacks have rallied our supporters in ways we never expected .
And we fully expect John McCain 's attacks tonight to help us make our grass - roots organization even stronger . "

HWiNFO Defeated
Cracking the impossible
Written by The Owl
Introduction
HWiNFO is a very nice hardware detection tool running under DOS .
but that 's not
the only thing it has been famous for ... the registration scheme developed by
its author is very unique in that it uses a proprietary encryption algorithm to
protect a registration check related routine which is decrypted runtime only .
since the key used is 64 bits long , brute force attack has no chance to succeed .
Tools required
Target 's URL / FTP
Program History
yes , as you will see , history does play a very important role in cracking HWiNFO
so let me tell you about it .
it began like 2.5 years ago when i first ran into
this program at SAC .
it had a very good executable protection , which i eventually
broke and could finally load it into IDA to study the registration scheme .
the
basic idea is that upon registration the user is provided with a character
string that encodes a 64 bit long number ( four 16 bit ones actually ) .
i do n't
really have memories any longer if the key length was this much at the
beginning but for the v4.x versions it is the case .
this long key was then used to decrypt a small routine runtime .
initially the
length of the encrypted data was 64 bytes but last year when a few successful
cracks showed up ( clever patches ) the author increased it to 105 bytes ( and
added a few more checks on the return values of this subroutine ) which has
remained so up until v4.4.3 .
when one compared these encrypted blocks to each other it became obvious that
the core of the function has not changed , the new code was responsible for
generating the return values only .
one possible way to get to the secret key
could have been the successful guessing of some plaintext bytes which would
have allowed the recovery of the key ( we shall see soon how the encryption
algorithm works ) .
unfortunately all of my attempts at this have failed for
over 2.5 years , no wonder now though ;- ) . what changed the situation is however the release of v4.4.4 at the end of
november where the author introduced yet another change in the encrypted data
( length became 107 bytes ) because of another clever crack ( which still was n't
a full key generator since for that one would have needed the secret key ) .
what
makes this change important is however the fact that the author inadvertantly
created a situation where the secret key could have been successfully recovered .
the rest of the essay will concentrate on this recovery procedure but NOT on
a full featured key generator which i will personally refrain from writing ever
since the author has all my respects for his creation .
i would also like to
discourage the reader from attempting this since HWiNFO itself is full - featured
and has a nag screen only that one can live with ...
in short , do not destroy what you have not built yourself .
Essay
so , first let 's see how the encryption / decryption algorithm works ( study the code below for a few minutes ) : mov si , offset pEncryptedData
mov bx , [ bp+key1 ] ; initialize registers
mov dx , [ bp+key2 ] ; with the key
mov di , [ bp+key3 ] ;
mov cx , [ bp+key4 ] ; loop :
xor [ si ] , bx ; decrypt a block
add [ si+2 ] , dx ;
sub [ si+4 ] , di ;
xor [ si+6 ] , cx ;
not word ptr [ si+6 ] ;
ror cx , 1 ; next round
neg dx ;
xor di , 1234h ;
xchg dx , cx ;
xchg bx , di ;
add si , 8
cmp si , offset pEncryptedDataEnd
jb loop
;... some parameter setup code
call pEncryptedData
;... checks for the return values we can observe a few things from this code excerpt .
first of all , we can divide
the subroutine into two independent parts .
the first 5 instructions of the
decryption loop do the actual decryption ( 8 bytes at a time ) , the rest of the
loop prepares the keys for the next round .
it is very important to note that
the key stream generation does NOT depend on the encrypted / decrypted data at
all .
in other words , if we knew the initial values of the 16 bit key words
( THE key actually ;-) , we could generate the rest of the key stream for an
arbitrary length of data .
let 's make a little drawing on the relationship between the ciphertext bytes
and the keystream bytes .
the initial values of the 16 bit key words are denoted
by A0 , B0 , C0 and D0 , the upcoming generations by Ai , Bi , Ci and Di where i is
an integer .
the encrypted data is represented by Ei , the decrypted data by Fi .
E0 E1 E2 E3 E4 E5 E6 E7 E8 ...
A0 B0 C0 D0 C1 D1 A1 B1 A2 ...
F0 F1 F2 F3 F4 F5 F6 F7 F8 ...
there 's a very simple relationship between the values in each column ( read the
code ;-) , and between two consecutive generations of the 16 bit key words
( i use the C language operators here and some ASM instructions ) :
F0 = E0 ^ A0 A ( 2*i+1 ) = ROL A ( 2*i ) , 1 A ( 2*i ) = XOR A( 2*i-1 ) ,1234h
F1 = E1 + B0 B ( 2*i+1 ) = NEG B ( 2*i ) B ( 2*i ) = ROR B ( 2*i - 1 ) ,
1
F2 = E2 - C0 C( 2*i+1 ) = XOR C( 2*i ) , 1234h C( 2*i ) = ROL C ( 2*i - 1 ) ,
1
F3 = ~( E3 ^ D0 ) D ( 2*i+1 ) = ROR D ( 2*i ) , 1 D( 2*i ) = NEG D2
so far so good , but why the heck does this help us in any way in recovering A0 ,
B0 , C0 and D0 ? from a cryptoanalytical point of view one would need to know the
values of Fi in order to be able compute the key words .
this is where one can
make educated guesses only , e.g. observe the compiler generated code elsewhere
in the program and assume that our encrypted routine has some similar code
patterns as well ( which turns out not to be case in the end , but it 's a good
exercise anyway to give it a few tries ) .
we could also guess some other
instructions which must occur in the code , e.g. retn or retf , or some other
magical numbers i did n't talk about ( nor will i since this is not a keygen
tutorial ) .
this has been the situation for a few years now , however as i already mentioned
something happened in the latest version of HWiNFO ... let 's have a look at the
new decryption routine ( only the change ) :
mov si , offset pEncryptedData - 2 ;... usual register setup ;... usual decryption loop ;... usual parameter setup call pEncryptedData ;... usual checks
so , what happened ?
we have an extra 2 bytes at the beginning of our encrypted
routine , which effectively shifts the applied keystream by 2 bytes as well .
let 's make another drawing to make it clear ( underscore refers to the fact
that we could have different values at those positions than previously ) : E - 1 E0 _ E1_ E2_ E3 _ E4_ E5 _ E6 _ E7 _ ...
A0 B0 C0 D0 C1 D1 A1 B1 A2 ... F - 1 F0_ F1_ F2_ F3_ F4_ F5_ F6_ F7 _ ... hmmm . does it look like it would help us ?
well , if we knew ONLY this data then
we would be in exactly the same situation as we were before with the other set
of data .
however now we have BOTH .
since the length of the new encrypted block
is exactly 107 bytes , we can make an assumption : Fi = Fi_ for i=0, 1 , ... another hmmm .
does this start out to look like we could have a few more or less
linear equations for the key stream words ?
yes it does ;-) F0 = E0 ^ A0 = E0 _ + B0 = F0 _ ( 0 )
F1 = E1 + B0 = E1 _ - C0 = F1 _ ( 1 )
F2 = E2 - C0 = ~( E2 _ ^ D0 ) = F2 _ ( 2 )
F3 = ~( E3 ^ D0 ) = E3 _ ^ C1 = F3 _ ( 3 ) so , we have 4 equations and 5 unknown variables ( A0 , B0 , C0 , D0 and C1 ) ,
kind of sucks .
but wait a minute ... did n't i say somewhere above that the
keystream does n't depend on anything but itself ?
in plain english that means
that we have a relationship ( read : another equation ) between C0 and C1 : C1 = C0 ^ 0x1234 ( 4 ) wow , we did it .
nothing should prevent us now from solving this system of
equations .
let 's substitue the value of C1 back into eq .
( 3 ) and then express
D0 from it : D0 = E3 ^ ~ ( E3 _ ^ C0 ^ 0x1234 ) from eq . ( 2 ) we also have : D0 = ~( E2 - C0 ) ^ E2 _ which means that E3 ^ ~( E3 _ ^ C0 ^ 0x1234 ) = ~( E2 - C0 ) ^ E2 _ ( 5 ) holds as well .
reducing one side to C0 only we have : C0 = E2 - ~( E2 _ ^ E3 ^ ~ ( E3 _ ^ C0 ^ 0x1234 ) ) ( 6 ) so , all what 's left to do is write a small program that enumerates all the
values of C0 for which eq . ( 6 ) holds .
as it turns out , we have 64 different
solutions for C0 and thus for A0 , B0 and D0 as well ( it 's fairly easy to see
that for each value of C0 there 's exactly one value for A0 , B0 and D0 ) .
once we have the key candidates , we can write a small brute forcer program
which decrypts our data using these keys .
a simple inspection of the decrypted
data in a disassembler will quickly reveal which key is the real one ... which
i wo n't publish here for various reasons , the most important ones being my
respect for the author ( after all we 're here for learning and not for stealing ) ,
and also i'd like the reader to do his / her homework ;-) .
Final Notes
i hope everyone has learned something from this little essay .
on one hand the
author of this otherwise excellent protection ( and i did n't even talk about the
executable protection which is another interesting one ... ) has had to learn
a more or less painful lesson on how one should not undermine his own scheme
by hacking it inappropriately ( probably in a hurry to defeat that crack i
mentioned in the intro and the program docs talk about as well ) , on the other
hand the reverse engineers should have got a lesson on how to be persistent
( beleive it or not , i did expect such a mistake to happen after i had seen the
author 's reaction on the various crack / patch attempts last year ) and how some
elementary knowledge in cryptoanalysis can help in cracking an otherwise large
( and thus secure ) key .
Ob Duh
I wont even bother explaining you that you should BUY this target program if you intend to use it for a longer period than the allowed one .
Should you want to STEAL this software instead , you do n't need to crack its protection scheme at all : you 'll find it on most Warez sites , complete and already regged , farewell .
You are deep inside Fravia 's page of reverse engineering , choose your way out :
The battle for the use of white spaces , the unused portions of the television broadcast spectrum , is heating up .
Google co-founder Larry Page attended a Capitol Hill hearing today and called upon the U.S. Federal Communications Commission to " free " the white spaces spectrum so it can be used as an affordable , nationwide , high - speed broadband connectivity network .
Page 's message :
Five years of testing and discussion on the issue is enough .
Page 's personal appearance brings star power to the dispute that pits companies such as Google , Microsoft and Motorola against wireless audio equipment manufacturers and live events producers .
The latter oppose the move to open up the spectrum , on the grounds that doing so would cause interference with equipment such as wireless microphones .
As analog television transmission is set to go digital by Feb.
2009 , large portions of the TV spectrum are expected to be remain unused .
" White spaces , " as these unused portions are known , currently appear as static between TV channels .
Companies such as Google that are part of the Wireless Innovation Alliance are asking for the white spaces to be unlicensed and open to all .
The white spaces could then be used to deliver inexpensive broadband connectivity to rural areas at a tenth of the cost of today 's municipal WiFi projects , they say .
The unused portions of the TV spectrum are attractive because signals can travel greater distances at lower power and are less susceptible to obstructions than the frequency bands used for current wireless technologies , like WiFi .
Availability of the broadband service could allow for low - cost devices , both licensed and unlicensed , to access this network .
But that 's where the hitch lies .
Unlicensed personal devices searching for wireless connectivity on the spectrum could potentially interfere with high - end wireless audio gear that uses that band , say wireless equipment manufacturers .
TV broadcasters are also resisting the move to open up the white spaces , which they regard as an important buffer zone , or " guard band , " between channels .
Page did n't hesitate from taking on his opponents at Capitol Hill .
The issue of opening up white spaces is being tainted by " politics , " he said , as some companies try to manipulate the FCC testing of field devices .
Some prototype devices have recently failed the FCC 's tests to see whether the devices could sense the presence of wireless microphone signals .
With the FCC likely to release its report on the field - testing process shortly , Page called on the Commission to issue a final order regarding the vacant spectrum by Election Day in early November , says a Google spokesperson .
Google has been lobbying hard to get regulators on its side in this issue .
Last month the company launched a " Free the Airwaves " campaign with a website and a petition lobbying the FCC to open up the spectrum .
So far about 16,000 people have signed the petition , says Google .
That 's not a very impressive number but Google hopes it has enough influential members in its alliance to tip the scales .
Also speaking on Capitol Hill were Marc Berejka , senior director for technology policy and strategy at Microsoft ; Gary Grube , senior fellow at Motorola ; and Neeraj Srivastava , director of technology policy , office of the chief technology officer at Dell .
Page 's fervent plea , though , is likely to have little impact .
It is unlikely the FCC will make a decision that could change the status quo before the elections .
On this issue , the usually fast - moving Google will have to get used to the FCC 's more leisurely pace .

Disgusted with Apple 's seemingly arbitrary and restrictive App Store policies , some developers have been thinking about dumping their iPhone projects in favor of Google 's open mobile platform , Android .
After being rejected by Apple , coder Alex Sokirynsky said he'd be an Android convert .
The wannabe iPhone developer recently gained widespread attention when Apple rejected his application Podcaster – because it allegedly " duplicates "
iTunes .
Then , Sokirynsky tried to sell his application through other means , and Apple shut down his operation .
As a result , Sokirnysky on
Tuesday announced in a blog post ( before removing it , presumably in light of Apple 's new non-disclosure policy regarding rejections ) that he would cease developing applications for Apple and code for Android instead .
" All I wanted was for someone from Apple to contact me and tell me how we can work it out so that I get into the app store , " he wrote .
" Instead , Apple took the cowards way out by simply disabling features in my developers portal .
This seems like a childish move for a company that has been proving such high - quality service and products in the past ....
I plan to make
Podcaster for the Android operating system .
At least there , I will be welcomed instead of being walked all over . "
One would imagine that Sokirynsky would lead the way for developers turned off by Apple 's unclear yet strict policies , ditching the App Store for
Android and eventually leaving the iPhone dry of new , innovative applications .
But crossing over to Google 's brand new open platform wo n't be as easy as it sounds .
Fraser Speirs coded the iPhone app Exposure , but disapproving of
Sokirynsky 's rejection , he said he would no longer make iPhone apps .
Despite this proclamation , he told Wired.com that it was unlikely he would develop for Android , because it would be complicated .
" I 'm basically playing with Android but I do n't really see that I 'm going to seriously develop for it , "
Speirs said in a phone interview .
" The Android software package is a known quantity now , but the hardware ecosystem is not .
It 's not clear to me that every phone running Android will be just like the HTC G1 :
There may be phones with touch screen and those without .
I think that whole part of the Android story is really unclear right now . "
Speirs added that switching over to Android would n't be that easy for him , because he 's done all his coding with Apple 's Cocoa platform – and programming an app for Android would require completely rewriting all of his software .
Nullriver CEO Adam Dann 's story is a bit different : Apple banned his application NetShare , which violated AT&T Terms of Service by turning the iPhone into a wireless modem .
To be more precise – after Apple approved NetShare , the company took the app down , and then restored it , pulled it down again and banned it permanently .
Dann , too , said his company is looking into developing for Android , but he has n't yet begun .
And despite
Apple 's fickleness , Nullriver is opting to continue developing software for iPhone , Dann said .
" [ Apple 's ] process of approval is a pain in the butt , where you make an app and it might get approved , or they might ban it , " Dann said in a phone interview .
" At the same time there 's a lot of money to make , and a lot of exposure you get from that platform .
Even if you get some applications banned , if you keep developing you 're going to come out ahead . "
Dann said there are pros and cons to both Android and the App Store .
For Android , he said the consequences of an open platform is you 'll " end up with a lot of garbage , " but on the plus side the environment promotes collaboration and innovation .
As for the App Store , he said the obvious benefits are quality control , but Apple 's downfall is " dictatorship , " which could intimidate programmers from trying to innovate .
Nonetheless ,
Android will pose some challenges to Apple .
What 's the App Store to do ?
Dann and Speirs say that if Apple wants to have rules , the company should make them clear :
That way , developers can know in advance whether their applications will be approved before they invest the time and money in coding them .
And what must Google do to compete with Apple ?
Dan Morrill , a key member of the Android team , said in an interview with APCMag that he 's aware Google faces a tough challenge .
But his team is focused on making the new operating system excellent on the early Android - powered phones first .
" What we ’d like to see is a platform that ’s open from end to end to allow all of these innovations that are kind of scattered across various carriers and various hardware manufacturers and various phone operating systems to kind of allow them to come together in a perfect storm of innovation on a mobile device , " Morrill said .

Two days before a widely anticipated presidential debate , John McCain said Wednesday he would skip the session and stay in Washington to work on the nation ’s financial crisis .
Barack Obama ignored McCain ’s invitation to join him and said he would show up for the debate as planned .
“ We must meet as Americans , not as Democrats or Republicans , and we must meet until this crisis is resolved , ” McCain said in a statement that set off a daylong flurry of political positioning on both sides .
McCain and his running mate , Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin , also planned to suspend advertising , party fundraising and any campaign appearances .
Obama rejected McCain ’s call to suspend presidential politicking less than six weeks before election day .
“ It ’s my belief that this is exactly the time when the American people need to hear from the person who , in approximately 40 days , will be responsible for dealing with this mess , ” Obama told reporters at a news conference in Florida .
“ It ’s going to be part of the president ’s job to deal with more than one thing at once . ”
An Obama spokesman indicated that the Illinois senator would travel to the Mississippi debate site regardless of McCain ’s attendance .
“ My sense is there ’s going to be a stage , a moderator , an audience and at least one presidential candidate , ” Robert Gibbs said .

The nonpartisan Commission on Presidential Debates and the University of Mississippi , host of the forum , also issued statements declaring their intention to proceed as planned .
“ We believe the public will be well - served by having the debates go forward as scheduled , ” the commission said in its statement .
A spokesman declined to speculate on what would happen if only Obama showed up .
The move by the Arizona senator was unprecedented in the 20 years the commission -- co-chaired by former heads of the national Republican and Democratic parties -- has overseen the presidential and vice presidential debates .
The panel was established to remove political brinkmanship from debate negotiations , and until Wednesday , the talks this year seemed to go particularly smoothly .
Asked how a solo Obama appearance would come off , Kathleen Hall Jamieson , a political communications expert at the University of Pennsylvania , said that would depend on events .
“ If there is no good reason for a U.S. senator who is not on any relevant committees to be in D.C. . . . you have one scenario , ” Jamieson said .
“ If it looks as though Sen. McCain is playing some role in brokering something and , as a result , he ’s doing something important in D.C. , you have an entirely different scenario . ”
The prospect of postponing Friday ’s debate rankled network executives , who have invested substantial resources in the infrastructure needed to carry the event live .
Finding another block of TV time would be difficult .
The coming month is crowded with fall television premiers , National Football League games and Major League Baseball playoffs .

“ Every network in America has that time laid out , ” Fox News anchor Shepard Smith said on the air Wednesday .
“ There are thousands of people en route to Oxford , Miss . , at this point .
For seven months they ’ve been working on this . ”

Spies get social network as CIA , FBI promote their version of Facebook RAW STORY
Published : Saturday September 6 , 2008
Print This Email This
At long last , US intelligence agencies have created a new system of sharing their information with one another to prevent another terrorist attack .
And it 's a lot like Facebook .
Not to be left out of the social networking action , the FBI , CIA and the other 14 U.S. intelligence agencies are getting a new site called A - Space designed specifically for spying , CNN reported .
" It 's every bit Facebook and YouTube for spies , but it 's much , much more , " said Michael Wertheimer , assistant deputy director of national intelligence for analysis .
" It 's a place where not only spies can meet but share data they 've never been able to share before , " Wertheimer said .
" This is going to give them for the first time a chance to think out loud , think in public amongst their peers , under the protection of an A - Space umbrella . "
Unlike the games and gossip of YouTube and Myspace , A - Space will be used primarily by intelligence analysts for tracking enemy movements in Iraq and Afghanistan .
The site 's goal is to combine all the intelligence agencies date in a single place so a crucial piece of information is n't ignored , like the pre-9/11 email from an FBI agent warning of people learning to fly airplanes but not learning to land them .
" There was the question , ' Was that a dot that failed to connect ? '
Well , that person did this via e-mail , " Wertheimer said .
" A - Space is the kind of place where you can log that observation and know that your fellow analysts can see that . "
Only those with specific proper security clearance will have access to A - Space , which will allow videos and satellite images of troop movements to be sent quickly from one user to another , DailyTech reported .
Government officials left out the details on how the site would be protected , though they did describe a " mechanism " called MasterCard , which will find suspicious behavior from users and report it to system administrators .
The site has been in testing for several months and will officially launch on September 22 .
There were growing signs yesterday that the " Sarah Palin effect " is starting to wear off and that the Republican candidate , John McCain , has peaked .
Democrats took heart from four national opinion polls which show that despite the bounce caused by interest in Mrs Palin , Mr McCain now leads by an average of just 1.6 points , his smallest margin since the Republican convention .
The latest polls come amid a flurry of critical news reports into Mrs Palin which cast doubt on some of her claims to be a squeaky clean reformist .
Senator McCain 's claims that his running mate had not sought special interest funding from Congress have been shown to be wrong .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
It emerged yesterday that she had asked the US to fund $ 453 m worth of projects in oil - rich Alaska for the past two years .
Among the requests was $ 4.5 m for an airport serving fewer than 100 people on a Bering Sea island and $ 9 m to help Alaska 's already hugely profitable oil companies .
Democrats mocked the Alaska governor as " an earmark queen " .
The disclosures come on top of evidence that her administration also held on to more than $ 500 m in federal funds for a much - derided " bridge to nowhere " which she maintains she vetoed .
For two weeks the McCain campaign has wallowed in the media 's obsession with Governor Palin .
A huge bounce in the opinion polls followed , with women especially declaring that they were changing their allegiance because they admired her so much .
But that appears to be changing as the focus of the election turns to the economy , especially in northern states .
In Iowa , a poll in the Des Moines Register gives Barack Obama a comfortable lead of 12 points .
In traditionally Republican southern states , however , the McCain campaign remains strong ( he has a 20 - point lead in South Carolina ) .
In the final weeks of the race for the White House , both sides are stepping up the attack , with events on Wall Street expected to provide the main focus .
A cacophony of news greets voters every day , including video press releases , blogs , and attack ads on television , on top of newspapers and television .
The Obama campaign is also spending tens of millions of dollars on advertising in an attempt to dominate the news agenda .
The McCain campaign , with less money to spend , relies on cable news channels to give free air time to the attack ads it releases .
The Obama campaign was quick to seize on comments by Mr McCain in Florida yesterday , which it said portrayed him as fundamentally out of touch with voters .
Speaking at a " town hall " meeting with supporters , he said that " the fundamentals of our economy are strong " before adding : " These are very , very difficult times and I promise you we will never put America in this position again . "
Citigroup is thinking of deals it can strike with consumer banks , like buying the struggling Washington Mutual out of bankruptcy if its reported efforts to auction itself should fail , that would provide it with cheaper deposit funding .
Mr. Mack also entered into discussions on Wednesday with Wachovia and several other banks , people briefed on those discussions said .
The talks with Wachovia are preliminary and a deal may not emerge .
The banks declined to comment .
Goldman Sachs may be under less pressure given its recent history of outperforming its peers .
The bank made $ 11.6 billion last year and has not posted a loss during the credit crisis .
Morgan Stanley has also performed well , but has suffered more write - downs and had a loss of $ 3.6 billion in the fourth quarter of last year .
Still , many specialists say they believe that the monumental events of the last four days herald a new period of painful change for the American financial industry  one that speculators are rushing to pounce on .
While Wall Street has gone through tough times before , only to emerge bigger and stronger , some financial specialists question whether the industry can rebound quickly after using high levels of leverage , or borrowed money , to binge on risky investments .
Those investments have proved to be disastrous .
Worldwide , financial companies have reported more than $ 500 billion in charges and losses stemming from the credit crisis  a figure some specialists say could eventually exceed $ 1 trillion .
Merrill Lynch rushed into the arms of Bank of America this week in a deal that in some ways harked back to the past .
During the Depression , Congress separated commercial banks , which take deposits and make loans , from investment banks , which underwrite and trade securities .
The investment banks were allowed to do business with less oversight , while commercial banks operated with tighter supervision .
But after Congress repealed those Depression - era laws in 1999 , commercial banks began muscling in on Wall Street ’s turf .
As the new competition whittled down profit margins , investment banks used more of their capital to trade securities and also began developing financial derivatives to fuel profits .
Now , executives like John A . Thain , the chief executive of Merrill and a former Goldman executive , say investment banks will need large bases of deposits to shore up their capital .
New Orleans has gotten its beans back .
These are not the creole red beans that hold a sacred place on Monday lunch menus across the city .
Rather , they are the measures of restaurant quality that the city ’s daily newspaper awards .
Let other critics use stars ; The Times - Picayune deals in beans .
In its Friday issue , for the first time since every restaurant in the city shut down after Hurricane Katrina nearly three years ago , the newspaper was handing out beans alongside a formal restaurant review .
“ The restaurant scene is once again robust enough to withstand critiques , ” said Jim Amoss , editor of The Times - Picayune .
By one count , there are 105 more restaurants than before the levees failed .
Given that there is plenty of crime , political scandal and rebuilding news to fill the pages of the paper , one would think that the return of a simple restaurant review might not attract much attention .
But this is New Orleans , a city dipped in gumbo and garlic butter whose essential culinary canon has not varied much since the late 1700s .
The Mars Phoenix Lander has been Twittering away its mission details since landing on Mars in May .
But lately , you can see a sense of impending doom starting to creep in , slowly : " It 's noon , Sol 81 .
I 've spotted frost around my landing site in AM , " tweeted Phoenix a few weeks ago .
" Seasons are longer here ... I 'll be surrounded by ice & do n't expect to survive til Spring , " comes a few days later .
But unlike other eerie autobiographical accounts of impending death , the wildly successful Mars Phoenix Lander has a trick up its sleeve for a potential reincarnation after the thaw .
" But as I 've said before , I 'm programmed with a ' Lazarus mode ' so I 'll call up to the Mars orbiters if I re-awaken in the Spring , " said Phoenix last week , probably in response to tearful return
Tweets lamenting his / her / its grim disposition .
If its solar panels collect enough juice come springtime , the first auto - function will be to contact the Mars Orbiter above with the good news of its reincarnation .
The folks at NASA are proud to be operating Phoenix at all at this point , having said anything beyond the intended 90 - day mission ( now officially extended to 120 days after water was officially collected for the first time ) is a gift to be savored .
That Lazarus
Tweet we 'll be watching for with open hearts .
Show that Winter who 's boss , little fella !
[ Twitter ]
Note :
In case it was confusing , the tweet image above is something I made .
Phoenix is , of course , bravely continuing to scoop and analyze soil samples this very minute , and has more mission time to go before winter sets in .
We 'll keep you updated .
AWESOME UPDATE :
And if my note above was n't enough , take the Phoenix Lander 's own word for it here and here .
I now have a new favorite commenter on Giz .
Sorry guys , but are there any more of you guys commenting from Mars ?

Palin : And I do look forward to Thursday night and debating Sen. Joe Biden .
We 're gonna talk about those new ideas , new energy for America .
I 'm looking forward to meeting him too .
I 've never met him before , but I 've been hearing about his Senate speeches since I was in like second grade .
Let 's see , Joe Biden was born on November 20 , 1942 and was elected into the Senate in 1972 .
John McCain was born on August 29 , 1936 , so if she was --- oh , never mind .
I do believe she will come out attacking Biden on Thursday night to appear the aggressor and the media will be wooed .
One of the most impressive features in Google 's open source Chrome web browser is V8 , a high - performance JavaScript virtual machine that was developed by a team of specialists in Denmark .
Although Chrome 's performance beats the current stable version of Firefox , benchmarks show that Mozilla 's next - generation JavaScript engine actually outperforms V8 .
Mozilla is using tracing optimization techniques and Adobe 's open source nanojit to increase the execution speed of SpiderMonkey , the JavaScript runtime engine in the Firefox web browser .
The new engine , which is called TraceMonkey , delivers unprecedented JavaScript performance .
The new optimizations have already landed in the latest Firefox nightly builds ( but still have to be manually enabled ) and will likely be included in Firefox 3.1 .
JavaScript creator and Mozilla CTO Brendan Eich ran the SunSpider JavaScript benchmarks against Chrome and the latest TraceMonkey - enabled Firefox build , which includes some recent improvements .
The benchmarks show that TraceMonkey is clearly faster than Google 's V8 .
Mozilla believes that the optimization technique used in TraceMonkey has the potential to unlock even more performance improvements .
Data source : Mozilla
" As we continue to trace unrecorded bytecode and operand combinations , we will only get faster , " Eich wrote in a blog entry .
" What spectators have to realize is that this contest is not a playoff where each contending VM is eliminated at any given hype - event point .
We believe that Franz & Gal - style tracing has more ' headroom ' than less aggressively speculative approaches , due to its ability to specialize code , making variables constant and eliminating dead code and conditions at runtime , based on the latent types inherent in almost all JavaScript programs . "
Eich also praises Chrome .
He says that the V8 JavaScript engine is " very - well engineered " and he describes the multiprocess design as " righteous " .
The results of the benchmark show that Mozilla is still a powerful force to be reckoned with in the browser space and that they will continue to innovate and remain relevant as new companies enter the market .
“ Russia is back on the stage as a responsible state capable of protecting its citizens ” ( Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov ) .
The emergency EU summit has met , deliberated and concluded as follows :
Strong condemnation of unilateral recognition of the independence of South Ossetia and Abkhazia .
Need for the six - point agreement of 12 August to be implemented .
Given their interdependence and the global problems they are facing , there is no desirable alternative to a strong relationship , based on cooperation , trust and dialogue , respect for the rule of law and the principles recognised by the United Nations Charter and by the OSCE .
Call on Russia to make this fundamental choice in favour of mutual interest , understanding and cooperation .
Until troops have withdrawn to the positions held prior to 7 August , meetings on the negotiation of the Partnership Agreement will be postponed .
What else was decided ?
Member States will continue to send observers to South Ossetia , and a fact - finding mission will be immediately dispatched with the task of helping to gather information and defining the modalities for an increased EU commitment under the European Security and Defence Policy .
Economic aid will be increased to help the reconstruction .
The Commission is to submit proposals in December 2008 to step up regional cooperation , in particular through its neighbourhood policy , the development of the “ Black Sea Synergy ” initiative and an “ Eastern Partnership ” which the European Council wishes to adopt in March 2009 .
An EU Special Representative for the crisis in Georgia will be appointed .
The recent events illustrate the need for Europe to intensify its efforts with regard to the security of energy supplies .
The Council and the Commission are to examine initiatives to be taken to this end , in particular as regards diversification of energy sources and supply routes .
The Council and the Commission are to evaluate the relationship forthwith and in the run-up to the Nice European Council meeting on 14 November 2008 .
The Presidents of the European Council and the Commission , and the High Representative , will go to Moscow on 8 September .
Just as assessing Russian strategy is complicated by non-rational influences , so individual Member States are influenced by their history and emotional attitudes towards Russia .
Consensus is understandably very difficult to achieve in the European Council , but is made more difficult because of the failure to treat the current Russia - EU standoff as a common problem requiring a common solution , and the loss of the spirit of solidarity , once the glue holding so much together .
Instead , the objective becomes to agree by consensus a declaration which necessarily papers over the disagreements .
Poland and the Czech Republic first and foremost want the American security umbrella , despite the effect of the Anti-Missile Project on Russian attitudes .
Germany is particularly dependent on Russian energy .
The UK has an ongoing dispute concerning the Russian refusal to extradite Andrei Lugovoi .
And so on .
Until there is a new incumbent in the White House , the US can not be expected to act decisively .
This gives Europe an opportunity to fill the vacuum , beginning with agreeing a common strategy .
We have seen what this means !
How then can find a workable common strategy ?
The starting point must be acceptance that the EU ’s policy towards Russia has failed ( without necessarily admitting this publicly ) .
In this process , we need to understand better how the Kremlin is thinking and what is its strategy .
At the end of this post , I have reproduced the Russian position as elucidated by its articulate and persuasive EU Ambassador , Vladimir Chizhov , to the European Policy Centre on 3 September .
The basis of the approach must be to find a solution in the long term in the mutual interests of the EU and Russia .
And integration and not separation must be the objective , starting with economic integration .
Historical disagreements and swapping allegations of unacceptable conduct will get us nowhere .
Above all , a mental change in attitude is required .
Europe should distance itself from the apparent intention of Georgian leaders to rebuild its armed forces as if another war with Russia is almost inevitable .
The Bush administration is examining what would be required to rebuild Georgia ’s military , but no decisions have yet been made .
Sanctions would take us down a dangerous path .
Calling off the October EU - Russia summit , as proposed by Poland , would be the wrong approach .
But the EU should propose that detailed negotiations for a Partnership & Cooperation be preceded by an agreement on the fundamentals required before negotiating specific provisions .
The need for greater EU energy security is obvious .
But this is not achievable without greater solidarity between Member States .
Reducing Europe ’s transporting dependence on Russia is essential .
This means that we must insist on Georgia being a conduit for gas from Central Asia .
Finally , we come to the two inflammatory issues which substantially influence Kremlin thinking and behaviour : NATO expansion and the US Anti-Missile Project .
As to NATO expansion , Georgia and Ukraine know this is now a dream and it needs to be recognised as such .
It ’s hard to imagine all NATO ’s present members being prepared to go to war with Russia over Georgia .
Europe does not fear an Iranian missile attack and the Polish and Czech participation is not predicated on this .
The EU should demand that Washington review the siting of bases in the EU .
This is feasible if Barack Obama wins in November .
But in return , Russia needs to behave as a responsible stakeholder internationally .
This includes ceasing to use the control of energy supplies as a political weapon as well not repeating elsewhere its disproportionate behaviour in Georgia and ending the bullying and harrassing of its neighbours , when they do not dance according to the Moscow tune .
Unless Russia ’s legitimate grievances are met , the EU will not progress beyond issuing consensual but ineffective declarations .
And in my view this means , Georgia and Ukraine not becoming full members of NATO , and no US anti-missile bases being sited in the EU .
However , the Kremlin ’s policy will be subject to domestic pressures , such as reactions to the substantial fall in Russia ’s stockmarket and now the weakness of the rouble due to the Georgian conflict .
Loss of direct inward investment is likely to be more influential than Western posturing .
Oil and natural gas account for 60 % of Russian exports , which means a very high dependence on ( falling ) oil prices .
Thrust of Ambassador Chikhov ’s remarks to EPC on 3 September :
The West is obsessed with the ‘ idée fixe ’ that it has to contain Russia .
It has not been able to prevent the Georgian leadership from invading South Ossetia .
It has closed its eyes over the violations of human rights by Georgia .
There has been too much ideology , remilitarisation and favouritism .
The Georgian President was not elected democratically last November .
He brutally suppressed the opposition .
Russia was in a difficult situation after the attack on South Ossetia .
It would have preferred not to intervene militarily , but had to defend the lives of its citizens .
Russia has been an example of moderation in the face of aggression .
We are not witnessing a return of the Cold War .
Today the world has become interdependent , with new powers rising on the horizon and the role of the West shrinking :
It represents only 15 per cent of the world ’s population .
The West has expanded NATO and has militarised Georgia The EU has violated OSCE stipulations by allowing weapon exports to Georgia and helping it build a military machine .
Russia has no interest in splitting the EU or to sever EU - US relations .
It welcomes a unified EU position for a strategic partnership with Russia .
Russia does not use energy as a political tool .

Even before the opening bell , Monday looked ugly .
But by the time that bell sounded again on the New York Stock Exchange , six and a half frantic hours later , $ 1.2 trillion had vanished from the United States stock market .
What had started 24 hours earlier , with a modest sell - off in stock markets in Asia , had turned into Wall Street ’s blackest day since the 1987 crash .
The broad market , as measured by the Standard & Poor ’s 500 - stock index , plunged almost 9 percent , its third - biggest decline since World War II .
The Dow Jones industrial average fell nearly 778 points , or 6.98 percent , to 10,365.45 .
Across Wall Street , no one could quite believe what was happening on the floor — the floor of the House of Representatives , not the New York Exchange .
As lawmakers began to vote on a $ 700 billion rescue for financial institutions , the Voyageur Asset Management trading desk in Chicago went silent .
Money managers gaped at a television screen carrying news that seemed unthinkable : the bill was not going to pass .
Shortly after 1:30 p.m. , the rescue was rejected .

For Immediate Release
September 15 , 2008
Astronomers have unveiled what is likely the first picture of a planet around a normal star similar to the Sun .
Three University of Toronto scientists used the Gemini North telescope on Mauna Kea in Hawai‘i to take images of the young star 1RXS J160929.1 - 210524 ( which lies about 500 light - years from Earth ) and a candidate companion of that star .
They also obtained spectra to confirm the nature of the companion , which has a mass about eight times that of Jupiter , and lies roughly 330 times the Earth - Sun distance away from its star .
( For comparison , the most distant planet in our solar system , Neptune , orbits the Sun at only about 30 times the Earth - Sun distance . )
The parent star is similar in mass to the Sun , but is much younger .
“ This is the first time we have directly seen a planetary mass object in a likely orbit around a star like our Sun , ” said David Lafrenière , lead author of a paper submitted to the Astrophysical Journal Letters and also posted online .
“ If we confirm that this object is indeed gravitationally tied to the star , it will be a major step forward . ”
Until now , the only planet - like bodies that have been directly imaged outside of the solar system are either free - floating in space ( i.e. not found around a star ) , or orbit brown dwarfs , which are dim and make it easier to detect planetary - mass companions .
The existence of a planetary - mass companion so far from its parent star comes as a surprise , and poses a challenge to theoretical models of star and planet formation .
" This discovery is yet another reminder of the truly remarkable diversity of worlds out there , and it's a strong hint that nature may have more than one mechanism for producing planetary mass companions to normal stars , ” said Ray Jayawardhana , team member and author of a forthcoming book on extrasolar planets entitled Worlds Beyond .
The team ’s Gemini observations took advantage of adaptive optics technology to dramatically reduce distortions caused by turbulence in Earth ’s atmosphere .
The near - infrared images and spectra of the suspected planetary object indicate that it is too cool to be a star or even a more massive brown dwarf , and that it is young .
Taken together , such findings confirm that it is a very young , very low - mass object at roughly the same distance from Earth as the star .
Even though the likelihood of a chance alignment between such an object and a similarly young star is rather small , it will take up to two years to verify that the star and its likely planet are moving through space together .
“ Of course it would be premature to say that the object is definitely orbiting this star , but the evidence is extremely compelling .
This will be a very intensely studied object for the next few years ! ” said Lafrenière .
Near - infrared spectra of 1RSX J160929.1-210524 and its candidate companion .
The primary 's spectrum ( row A ) is as expected for a temperature of about 4000 K ( spectral type K7 ) .
The candidate companion 's spectrum ( black curves repeated in rows B - - F ) is compared with the spectra of two young brown dwarfs ( red curves on rows B -- C ; spectral types M9 and L1 ) and two older , cooler brown dwarfs ( red curves on rows D-- E ; L3 and L6 .
The `triangular ' shape of the left part of the companion 's spectrum is in much better agreement with the two young brown dwarfs , indicating the candidate companion has low gravity ; in turn , this implies it has not yet fully contracted and thus is still young .
The companion spectrum and those of all comparison objects have been normalised to be the same on the right - hand side .
The fact that , compared to the young brown dwarfs , the candidate companion is slightly fainter in the left - hand part * indicates that it it is cooler * , more like the field L3 brown dwarf .
The comparison with models ( row F ) confirms that the companion has low gravity , and thus is young .
Team member Marten van Kerkwijk described the group ’s search method .
“ We targeted young stars so that any planetary mass object they hosted would not have had time to cool , and thus would still be relatively bright , ” he said .
“ This is one reason we were able to see it at all . ”
The Jupiter - sized body has an estimated temperature of about 1800 Kelvin ( about 1500 ºC ) , much hotter than our own Jupiter , which has a temperature of about 160 Kelvin ( - 110 ºC ) , and its likely host is a young star of type K7 with an estimated mass of about 85 % that of the Sun .
For more characteristics of the star and planet see this table from the paper .
The work that led to this discovery is part of a survey of more than 85 stars in the Upper Scorpius association , a group of young stars formed about 5 million years ago .
It uses the Gemini telescope 's high - resolution adaptive optics capabilities to determine the different types of companions that can form around young stars : stars , brown dwarfs , or planetary mass objects .
“ This discovery certainly has us looking forward to what other surprises nature has in stock for us , ” said Van Kerkwijk .

What kind of bike ?
I do n't know , I 'm not a bike scientist .
What I am though is a manly guy looking to sell his bike .
This bike is made out of metal and kick ass spokes .
The back reflector was taken off , but if you think that deters me from riding at night , you 're way wrong .
I practiced ninja training in Japan 's mount Fuji for 5 years and the first rule they teach about ninja biking is that back reflectors let the enemy know where you are .
Not having a rear reflector is like saying " FUCK YOU CAR , JUST TRY AND FIND ME " .
The bike says Giant on the side because it 's referring to my junk , but rest assured even if you have tiny junk that Giant advertisement is going to remain right where it is .
I bought this bike for 300 dollars from a retired mercenary that fought in both World War 1 and World War 2 and had his right arm bitten off by a shark in the Phillipines while stationed there as a shark handler .
When he sold it to me I had to arm wrestle him for the honor to buy it .
I broke his arm in 7 places when I did .
He was so impressed with me he offered me to be his son but I thought that was sissy shit so I said no way .
The bike has some rusted screws , but that just shows how much of a bad ass you are .
Everyone knows rusted screws on a bike means that you probably drove it underwater and that 's bad ass in itself .
Those screws can be replaced with shiny new ones , but if you 're going to go to that trouble why not just punch yourself in the balls since you 're probably a dickless lizard who does n't like to look intimidating .
The bike is for men because the seat is flat or some shit and not shaped like a dildo .
If you like flat seated bikes you 're going to love this thing because it does n't try to penetrate your ass or anything .
I 've topped out at 75 miles per hour on this uphill but if you 're just a regular man you 'll probably top it out at 10 miles per hour .
This thing is listed as a street bike which is man -code for bike tank .
The bike has 7 speeds in total : Gear 1 - Sissy GearGear 2 - Less Sissy GearGear 3 - Least Sissy GearGear 4 - Boy GearGear 5 - Pre-teen Boy GearGear 6 - Manly GearGear 7 - Big Muscles GearI only like gear 6 and 7 to be honest .
Additionally , this tool of all immense men comes with a gigantic lock to keep it secure .
The lock is the size of a bull 's testicles and tells people you do n't fuck around with locking up your bike tank .
It tells would - be - thieves " Hey asshole , touch this bike and I 'll appear from the bushes ready to club you with a two - by - four " .
Bike is for 150 OBO ( and do n't give me no panzy prices )
Superheroes , as we all know , exist to save the day .
It 's what they do - Swoop down from on high , solve the problems and swoop back on out again .
But what happens when they not only do n't save the day , but play an active part in the destruction of the world ?
That 's the basis for the latest relaunch of DC Comics '
Wildstorm line , entitled World 's End .
Following three Biblically - titled series ( Armageddon , Revelations and Number Of The Beast ) , the Earth has been knocked off its axis , London has been destroyed by a crashed spaceship , and entire cities have been flooded and left unhabitible , all thanks to a battle between superhumans that did n't really go as well as could be expected .
Wildstorm editor Ben Abernathy explained the thinking behind permanently changing the status quo of this particular superhero universe :
Looking at the landscape of the industry , we realized we needed to move our universe in a different direction , something that the " Big Two " could n't , or would n't , do for a long period of time .
And we decided that direction should be toward a sci- fi / horror direction of a post - apocalyptic setting ( to a degree , an almost logical extension to where the [ Wildstorm Universe ] has been headed for years ) .
There have been " visions " of a devastated , bleak future in other mainstream super - hero books , but nothing with the lasting impact or direction that the World 's End books will be tackling .

The World 's End setting definitely is n't a cosmetic change for the line ; former fan - favorite books have been relaunched with significant changes , including depowering ( and deforming ) half of The Authority before stranding them in an electricity - less radioactive former London and placing the Wildcats in charge of the sole refugees of a dying New York City .
Advertisement
This is n't the first time that the Wildstorm line has gone all out for change ; in 2003 , their Coup D'Tat series had the Authority depose the US Government and set themselves up as dictators of the United States , before they realized that they could n't be bothered with all the paperwork .
But with fans still hurting about 2006's failed Worldstorm relaunch ( which died when Grant Morrison 's core two series Wildcats and The Authority disappeared after one and two issues , respectively ) , will even the end of the world get them interested in checking out the series again ?
Possibly not - comic fans are a notoriously fickle bunch , and I say that as one of the more fickle - but they should ; although the lead - ins vary wildly in quality ( Armageddon is fairly avoidable , and Revelations could 've been half the length ; Number Of The Beast , though again overlong , is very enjoyable , however ) , the World 's End relaunch works .
With this shift , the books have not only become far less of the generic superhero titles that they used to be , they also move outside of the superhero genre in general , having more in common with movies like I Am Legend and 28 Days Later , and it finally gives them an identity that is n't just " Superheroes who are a little bit more violent than the more famous ones , " and watching characters who are more than slightly responsible for the end of the world as we know it having to be responsible for trying to rebuild society - while dealing with their guilt is , if nothing else , different from the traditional superhero angst .
I 'm not sure about the longterm prospects of the project - and hope that there 's no deus ex machina planned , even though they 've already partially set one up at the end of Number of The Beast - but for now , World 's End is doing something that very few superhero comics can do :
Showing what happens when everything goes wrong and no - one can save the day anymore .

Wildstorm : World 's End [ DC Comics ]
Following up on Nicole 's post from yesterday , this great editorial in The New York Times fact - checks President Bush 's speech at the Economic Club of New York .
Needless to say , it ai n't pretty .
Through Bush - Colored Glasses :
Mr. Bush said he was optimistic because the economy ’s “ foundation is solid ” as measured by employment , wages , productivity , exports and the federal deficit .
He was wrong on every count .
On some , he has been wrong for quite a while .
Mr. Bush boasted about 52 consecutive months of job growth during his presidency .
What matters is the magnitude of growth , not ticks on a calendar .
The economic expansion under Mr. Bush — which it is safe to assume is now over — produced job growth of 4.2 percent .
That is the worst performance over a business cycle since the government started keeping track in 1945 .
This is the legacy of President Bush .
This is the legacy of the enabling and entirely complicit Republican - controlled Congress .
This is the legacy John McCain is promising to continue .

Think Progress reports that the Bush administration have been playing politics with Iraq withdrawal plans , pressuring Maliki to delay an agreed withdrawal date by a year because the White House was concerned that Maliki ’s endorsement of a 2010 time line would damage Sen.
John McCain ’s ( R - AZ ) presidential campaign .
The revelation came in an al - Iraqiya interview with Maliki last week :
MALIKI : Actually , the final date was really the end of 2010 and the period between the end of 2010 and the end of 2011 was for withdrawing the remaining troops from all of Iraq , but they [ the Bush administration ] asked for a change [ in date ] due to political circumstances related to the domestic situation [ in the US ] so it will not be said to the end of 2010 followed by one year for withdrawal but the end of 2011 as a final date .
Agreement has been reached on this issue .
They are willing to respond positively because they , too , are facing a critical situation .
UPDATE : Rachel Maddow covered the topic on her Monday show : Download Download ( h/t Heather )
Matt Duss asks :
" What did McCain know about this , and when did he know it ? "
Maybe we could ask Iran / Contra liar and current Deputy National Security Adviser for Global Democracy Strategy , Elliot Abrams .
Apparently , Abrams is regularly briefing the McCain campaign — McCain 's favorite lobbyist for Georgia , Randy Scheunemann , appears to be the main contact — and has told friends and colleagues that he is confident that he will get a top post in a McCain administration .
The link between childhood autism and vaccines has , once again , been refuted .
A large study by Columbia 's Mailman School of Public Health Center for Infection and Immunity found no link between measles , mumps and rubella ( MMR ) vaccine and autism cases .
For many in the medical community , the issue is now closed .
But why do many people continue to believe that there is a link despite overwhelming evidence ?
The answer is something that has more credibility than the best scientific study : personal experience .
Many parents came to believe that vaccines caused their children 's autism because the symptoms of autism appeared after the child received a vaccination .
On a psychological level , that assumption and connection makes sense ; but on a logical level , it is a clear and common fallacy with a fancy Latin name : post hoc ergo propter hoc ( " after this , therefore because of it " ) .
Because the human mind seeks connections , people often misattribute causes , thinking that , " B happened after A did , so A must have caused B . "
The child was fine until he was vaccinated , and soon he showed signs of autism .
It makes sense -- except that it 's not necessarily true .
It 's like saying " roosters crow before the sun rises , so the roosters must have made the sun rise . "
First - year students of statistics are constantly reminded that " correlation does not imply causation . "
That is , two events that appear to be causally related may not be ; there are other possibilities .
The appearance of causation may simply be coincidence ; or A may have caused B , or B may have caused A ; or there may be a third unknown factor relating to A and / or B .
Only carefully controlled scientific studies can conclusively tell the difference .
As it happens , autism often first expresses itself in children at about the same time that vaccinations are recommended for those children .
According to lead author Dr. Mady Hornig , " We found no relationship between the timing of MMR vaccine and the onset of autism . "
In fact , the new study showed that often the first autism symptoms actually preceded the vaccination shots , and therefore could not have been caused by them .
The misunderstanding is made worse by high - profile , non-scientific claims by activists linking vaccines to autism ( model and actress Jenny McCarthy , for example , appeared on " Larry King Live " earlier this year accusing medical doctors of ignorance of the facts and hiding evidence ) .
This issue shows why public health policy must be guided by science instead of celebrity — or even personal experience .
Benjamin Radford is managing editor of the Skeptical Inquirer science magazine .
He wrote about the media and pop culture in his book " Media Mythmakers : How Journalists , Activists , and Advertisers Mislead Us . "

NEW YORK -- Seven years ago today , terrorists flew the plane carrying my father into the World Trade Center .
The crash of American Airlines Flight 11 was an extraordinarily public event .
The death of the man who gave me my passion for sailing , baseball , playing the guitar , and telling a story is my private tragedy .
I 've never wanted to mix the two , the public with the private .
Everyone has seen the grainy video of the Boeing 767 slamming into the North Tower and exploding into flames .
I 've seen it far too many times .
Every Sept. 11 , countless memorial services , blood drives , and charity events commemorate the day .
I 've never been to any of them .
Tens of thousands have paid their respects at ground zero .
I had never been able to bring myself to come here .
Until now .
As a son , I decided it was time to finally visit the place where my father died , and try to move on .
And what I saw is that ground zero has moved on , too .
In some ways , the locus of one of America 's greatest tragedies has become just another storied block in this storied city , as normal as the passenger planes that descend over the Manhattan skyline on a clear September morning like silver dragonflies .
The place where the World Trade Center once stood is a cavernous construction project surrounded by bustling streets where vendors hawk photos of the burning towers and other Sept. 11 memorabilia to passing tourists ; bankers and brokers rush to and from their offices with barely a glance toward the site where the foundations for buildings are being laid ; and the roar of buses and tractors drowns out ordinary conversation .
As I watched men in orange hats navigate the warren of concrete and gravel , a spectator spoke up .
" When do you think it will be finished ? " he asked .
His name was Walter Saravia , a student at New York City College of Technology .
When the first plane hit , Saravia was nearby .
He could n't get the smoke and the sirens out of his head for days .
He had been by the memorial a number of times , but yesterday was the first time he had stopped to really look .
" It 's like a bad memory you subconsciously avoid , " Saravia said as he stared through a mesh wire fence at the giant ramp leading down to the floor of the site , lined by the flags of the nations whose citizens died in the Sept. 11 attacks .
" When you 're from the city , you start to take for granted what is here . "
Today , families of the victims will be allowed to go down the ramp and lay flowers at the site .
But the rest of the ceremonies will be held on a stage across the street from ground zero .
They started doing that last year , instead of marking the day in the pit , according to Victor Valdez , a security guard at the site .
20 Ways to Overcome Shyness
Photo by Jordan Fraker .
See more of his work here .
Can you remember the last time you stepped into a room full of strangers and felt that self - conscious and awkward feeling rush over you ?
Or that heart thumping moment when you wanted to ask someone on a date , but were too shy to do so ?
Or wanting to approach someone for business , but was too hesitant to actually do it ?
That anxiety in the pit of your stomach in social situations ?
Does it always feel like something is holding you back ?
Regardless of whether you are introverted or extraverted , we can all relate to that feeling of shyness at some point in our lives .
Socially , we tend to have the misconception that only introverts experience shyness , but that is not true .
Shyness has more to do with being uncomfortable with one ’s self , especially around other people .
This article is the result of collaboration between Amanda Linehan , an introvert , and Tina Su , an extravert .
Together , we wanted to shed some light on the topic of shyness in a collective perspective from both extremes .
We will also share the ways that we used to turn shyness into personal empowerment .
The Three Components of Shyness
According to Dr. Bernardo J. Carducci of the Shyness Research Institute , shyness has three components :
Excessive Self - Consciousness – you are overly aware of yourself , particularly in social situations .
– you are overly aware of yourself , particularly in social situations .
Excessive Negative Self - Evaluation – you tend to see yourself negatively .
– you tend to see yourself negatively .
Excessive Negative Self - Preoccupation – you tend to pay too much attention to all the things you are doing wrong when you are around other people .
Can you relate ?
When you are experiencing shyness , can you fit your state of mind into one or more of the above categories ?
We sure can .
Why Do We Experience Shyness ?
We all experience shyness differently and on varying degrees .
However , root cause can be boiled down to one of the following reasons :
1. Weak Self Image
This is especially true to our experiences in high school .
We would believe in the fallacy that our unique qualities were not interesting , cool or worthy of anyone ’s admiration .
We would try to fit in with everyone else , resulting in us not feeling like ourselves .
Amanda : Looking back I ’m not even sure I knew what my unique abilities were , I just knew that everybody else seemed to be a cooler , more interesting person than I was , so I tried to imitate them …poorly . :)
Tina : I thought of myself as cool , because I was loud , and worked very hard at keeping that image .
It was of course , a false image that I worked hard to keep .
It was exhausting and I was exceedingly self conscious .
Even though people did n’t view me as shy , but I felt shy most of the time with a lot of built up anxiety .
Turns out , the ‘ cool ’ kids themselves have weak self images and wanted to fit in with everyone else .
2. Pre-occupation with Self
When we ’re around other people , we become extremely sensitive to what we ’re doing , as if we ’ve been put on center stage .
This creates anxiety and makes us question our every move .
Our focus centers around ourselves and particularly on “ what I was doing wrong ” .
This can cause a downward spiral .
Amanda : Coupled with a weak self image , I did n’t think Iwas doing anything right !
And this would start a cycle that I could n’t get out of .
What I understand now is that is that most people are not looking at me with the detail thatI was looking at myself .
Tina : I too was very sensitive to my every move around other people .
My senses were heightened to the way I talked , walked , laughed , etc .
My focus was on how to not screw up in front of other people , and this made me very nervous .
What I understand now is that everyone is so caught up with their own insecurities that they hardly notice yours .
3. Labeling
When we label ourselves as a shy person , we psychologically feel inclined to live up to those expectations .
We may say to ourselves , “ I am a shy person , than it must be true that I am shy .
This is how I am , and this is the way things are . ”
When we label something , that thing has the perception of being fixed and therefore we must live up to the expectations of the labeling .
Amanda : I was known by others as a shy person , or a quiet person , and this perception held me captive at times .
People expected me to be a certain way and so I was .
And knowing that other people regarded me as shy , in addition to my not wanting to be shy , resulted in great anxiety when I was with people .
I really wanted to show myself to others when I was around them , but it was easy to simply go along with what others expected from me .
Tina :
Deep down , I felt the anxieties from shyness often , yet , when I ’m around people , I had to live up to the expectations that I was n’t shy .
My experiences with shyness would manifest in unusual ways , like when I ’m ordering food , when I call someone on the phone , or speak to strangers .
I would never let that side of myself show , but I do experience it .
In those moments , I can hear myself say , ‘ I am shy . ’
How to Overcome Shyness
We ’ve both experienced different variations of shyness , and through practice and increased awareness we have both overcome this .
The following are tips that have helped us overcome this uncomfortable feeling .

1. Understand Your Shyness
Seek to understand your unique brand of shyness and how that manifests in your life .
Understand what situation triggers this feeling ?
And what are you concerned with at that point ?
2. Turning Self Consciousness into Self Awareness
Recognize that the world is not looking at you .
Besides , most people are too busy looking at themselves .
Instead of watching yourself as if you are other people , bring your awareness inwards .
Armed with your understanding of what makes you shy , seek within yourself and become the observing presence of your thoughts .
Self awareness is the first step towards any change or life improvement .
3. Find Your Strengths
We all have unique qualities and different ways of expressing ourselves .
It ’s important to know and fully accept the things we do well , even if they differ from the norm .
If everyone was the same , the world would be a pretty boring place .
Find something you are good at and focus on doing it .
An identifiable strength will boost your natural self esteem and your ego , helping you better identify with yourself .
It is a short term fix , but will give you the confidence you need to break your self - imposed barrier of fear .
See how your unique strength gives you an advantage .
For example , Amanda is a naturally quiet person who prefers to spend time alone .
She learned that she listens better than others and notices things that others miss in conversations .
She also discovered that her alone time has given her a better understanding of herself .
4. Learn to Like Yourself
Practice appreciating yourself and liking the unique expression that is you .
Write a love letter to yourself , do things you enjoy , give gratitude for your body and its effortless functions , spend quality time getting to know yourself , go on a self - date .
5. Not Conforming
Trying to fit in like everyone else is exhausting and not very much fun .
Understand that it is okay to be different .
In fact , underlying popular kid ’s public displays of coolness , they too are experiencing insecurities , self - consciousness , and awkwardness .
Accept that you may not be perceived as the most popular social butterfly , and you may not want to be either .
At the end of the day , being popular will not make you happy .
Accepting your unique qualities can set you free .
6. Focus on Other People
Rather than focusing on your awkwardness in social situations , focus on other people and what they have to say .
Become interested in learning about others , and probe them to talk about themselves .
You can try pondering the question while interacting :
What is it about this person that I like ?
7. Releasing Anxiety through Breath
Anxiety and fear can feel overwhelming if you are practicing to become more assertive in order to overcome this fear .
One simple technique to calm this anxiety into manageable bites is taking deep breaths with your eyes closed , while concentrating on just your breaths .
Inhale and exhale slowly while clearing out all thoughts .
Another technique is from yoga : counting as you inhale and then as you exhale .
Slowly leveling out your inhale and exhale duration .
Example , 4 count for in and 4 for out .
Once your breaths are leveled , add an extra count during your exhale .
This means slowing down your exhale by just a tad as compared to your inhale .
Continue for a few minutes until you are comfortable , than add another count to your exhale .
You can easily do this in the bathroom , or in a spare room of when you need it .
8. Releasing Anxiety through Movement
One way of viewing anxiety is that it is blocked energy that needs to be released .
We can release this energy through physical movement .
Exercises like jogging or walking will help to re-channel some of the blocked energies , but also helps by pulling you out of the situation and shifts your state of mind .
This refreshed state of mind will help by adding perspectives to things .
Another effective technique is a simple muscle meditation / exercise .
Sit down or lie down .
Bring awareness to every part of your body , starting from your toes and moving up your body to the top of your head .
At every part of your body , tighten the muscles at the center of awareness for 3 - 5 seconds , and then relax .
Repeat this until you get to the top of your head .
Remember to breathe .
9. Visualization
Visualizing yourself in the situation as a confident and happy person helps to shape your perception of yourself when you are actually in the situation .
Close your eyes , sit back somewhere relaxing , listen to some relaxing music , imagine yourself in a scene or situation and see yourself the way you would like to be .
In this scene , how do you feel ?
What do you hear ?
Do you smell anything ?
Are you moving ?
What do you see ?
Get all your senses involved to make it real .
10 . Affirmation
Words can carry incredible energy .
What we repeatedly tell ourselves , gets heard by our unconscious mind , and it acts accordingly .
If we repeatedly tell ourselves that we are incapable , and too shy to do anything , we will become increasingly aware of evidence to back up this ‘ fact ’ , and our actions will always match what we tell ourselves .
Similarly , if we repeatedly tell ourselves that we are capable , confident , and wonderful human beings , our unconscious mind will likely surface the awareness that gives evidence to this new ‘ fact ’ .
While , we ca n’t lie to ourselves , positive visualization and affirmation are helpful in placing us along the road of positive thought patterns .
11 . Do Not Leave an Uncomfortable Situation
When we leave shy situations , what we are really doing is reinforcing our shyness .
Instead , face the situation square in the face .
Turn the fearful situation into a place of introspection and personal growth .
Become the observer and dig into yourself , answer the questions : why do I feel this way ?
What caused me to feel this way ?
Can there be an alternative explanation to what is happening ?
12 . Accept Rejection
Accept the possibility that we can be rejected and learning to not take it personally .
Remember , you are not alone and we all experience rejections .
It is part of life and part of the learning process .
The key lies in how you handle rejections when they come .
It helps to be mentally prepared before they happen :
Never take it personally .
It was not your fault .
It just was n’t meant to be .
The scenario was not the best fit for you .
Find the lesson – what did you learn ?
There is a lesson ingrained in every situation .
And through these life lessons lies the potential for you to become a better person , a stronger person .
Nothing is lost if you can find the lesson .
See these as the blessings in disguise .
Move on .
Recognize that when you fall into self - pity , you are not moving forward .
Nothing will be changed from your self - pity .
When you start to recognize this , it becomes clear that only energy is wasted while we feed to our problem - seeking ego .
Pick yourself up , dust off the dirt and move on to the next thing .
Try again , try again , try again .
It will pay off !
13 . Relinquish Perfectionism
When we compare ourselves , we tend to compare ourselves with the most popular person in the room or we compare ourselves with celebrities we see on TV .
We set excessive expectations by comparing ourselves unreasonably to people unlike ourselves and wonder “ why ca n’t I be that ? ”
We carry with us a vision of another ’s perfection and expect ourselves to fit that exact mold .
And when we do n’t fit , we beat ourselves up for it , wondering why we are such failures .
You see , the problem lies in our emphasis on fitting into a vision we have created in our minds , which is not us .
Let go of this perfect image , create visions of yourself out of the Being from who you are , naturally ; and let that expression flow , naturally .

14 . Stop Labeling Yourself
Stop labeling yourself as a shy person .
You are you , you are unique , and you are beautiful .
Ca n’t we just leave it at that ?
15 . Practice Social Skills
Like any other skill , social skills can be cultivated through practice and experience .
The more you put yourself out there , the easier it becomes next time .
If you have a hard time knowing what to say , you can practice what to say ahead of time .
16 . Practice Being in Uncomfortable Situations
Sometimes , it is not the social skills we lack , but rather the lack of self confidence that we may succeed , and a heightened fear that we will fail .
Placing yourself in these uncomfortable situations will help to desensitize your fear towards the situation .
The more you force yourself to face it , and to experience it completely , you will realize that it is not that bad after all .
It may be hard for your ego to accept at first , but quickly you will find that you can just laugh and enjoy it .
During social settings where you may experience nervousness , periodically ask yourself the following three questions .
Doing so will distract yourself from more self - destructive thoughts .
Make it your mantra :
Am I breathing ?
Am I relaxed ?
Am I moving with grace ?
18 . What is Comfortable for You ?
Going to bars and clubs is n’t for everyone , and that ’s okay .
Understand what feels comfortable for you , and find people , communities and activities which bring out the best in you .
You can be just as equally social in settings that you connect with on a personal level , than the popular social settings .
You do n’t have to be doing what “ everyone ” else is doing .
Besides , everyone else is n’t necessarily happy , despite your perception as such .
19 . Focus on the Moment
Becoming mindful of what you ’re doing , regardless of what you ’re doing , will take focus away from the self .
When you are having a conversation , forget about how you look , focus on the words , fall into the words , become absorbed in the words .
The tones .
The expression .
Appreciate it and give gratitude for it .
20 . Seek and Record Your Successes
As you overcome this condition we ’ve been labeling as shyness , you will have many wins and realizations about yourself .
You will gain insights into the truth behind social scenarios .
You will start to view yourself differently and come to recognize that you can become comfortable and confident .
When these wins and realizations happen , make sure to keep a notebook and write them down .
Keeping a journal of your successes will not only boost self confidence , but also shift your focus towards something that can benefit you .
What are some of your moments of shyness ?
What did you do to overcome them ?
If you have n’t overcome them , why do you think that is the case & what can you do about it next time ?
See you in the comments ! :)
The promotional campaign focuses on increasing awareness of organic produce among young people to ensure a future market for organic , under its main slogan : “ Organic farming : Good for nature , good for you . ” ​
Professionals in the industry can use the slogans for marketing purposes .
But despite undertones that imply health benefits from organic produce , the European Commission is denying its support for organic farming over conventional , saying is merely seeking to help the organic sector .
“ We are not favouring organic as an alternative to conventional , ” ​ Michael Mann , agriculture spokesman for the European Commission , told FoodNavigator.com .
“ Merely we are providing the marketing tools to aid progress in the organic industry while helping consumers make their own choices on which products to buy . ” ​
However , Soil Association said the message that organic is good for you and for the planet is more “ bold and upfront ” ​ than previous information put out to the public .
P​romotional campaign​
Aside from the main slogan , the Commission has developed a list of slogans and key messages for use by professionals , such as : “ ​ Organic farming .
The natural choice ” ; “ Organic farming .
In nature we trust ” ; “ Organic farming .
In goodness we trust ” ; ​and “ Organic products meet consumer demand for authentic , high quality and tasty food ” .​
It has also announced a competition to develop a new organic faming logo , which will be compulsory on all organic products in Europe from mid-2010 , as long as long as at least 95 per cent of the ingredients are organic .
The campaign has been launched within the framework of the European Action Plan for Organic Food and Farming , which also sets out 21 initiatives for developing the organic market and improving standards by increasing efficiency and transparency and thereby increasing consumer confidence .
Mariann Fischer Boel , European commissioner for agriculture and rural developments , said : “ Consumer demand for organic products is growing , offering business opportunities for all sectors of the food supply chain .
In launching this campaign , I call on all stakeholders involved in organic farming to promote the organic idea . ” ​
Already in place is a scheme enabling European countries to offer help to farmers and producers wishing to convert from to organic .
The organic market has been experiencing considerable growth in recent years of between 5 and 30 per cent depending on the country , according to the European Commission .
Demand is driven by an increasing move away from produce grown using pesticides as consumers become more aware of the effects diet can have on their health .
The UK Soil Association , advocates of organic food , expects a healthy 10 per cent growth for sales of organic products this year , which it says if four to five times higher than sales growth for the general food market in a good year .
Organic controversy ​
As the organic market has seen increasing popularity , scientists have been debating the differences between the health benefits of organic and conventional produce .
For example , in a report published in March , the Organic Center at America 's Organic Trade Association argued that organic produce is 25 per cent more nutritious than conventional foodstuffs .
However , only last week , a report by Joseph Rosen , emeritus professor at Rutgers University and scientific advisor to the American Council on Science and Health ( ACSH ) disputed claims by a previous study that organic produce is 25 per cent more nutritious than conventional food .
Rosen concluded that conventional products are actually 2 per cent more nutritious than organic varieties .
A review from the British Nutrition Foundation last June said that the overall body of science does not support the view that organic food is more nutritious than conventionally grown food .
" Organic farming represents a sustainable method of agriculture that avoids the use of artificial fertilisers and pesticides and makes use of crop rotation and good animal husbandry to control pests and diseases , " ​ wrote BNF 's Claire Williamson .
" From a nutritional perspective , there is currently not enough evidence to recommend organic foods over conventionally produced foods . " ​
Meanwhile , ​​Amarjit Sahota , director for the UK's Organic Monitor , said : " Over the last few years , more and more research has shown that there are more vitamins and nutrients in organic food than in conventional food .
And there is far more research coming out with this conclusion than vice versa . " ​
In terms of organic farming being better for the planet , the UK government has concluded that organic farming uses 26 per cent less energy than conventional practices .
“ They did n’t seriously consider her until four or five days from the time she was picked , before she was asked , maybe the Thursday or Friday before , ” a Republican told the New York Times .
“ This was really kind of rushed at the end , because John did n’t get what he wanted .
He wanted to do Joe or Ridge . ”
A daring military operation ended the French - Colombian politician 's six - year ordeal as a high - profile bargaining chip and dealt a devastating blow to the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia ( Farc ) .
Without a shot being fired military spies tricked the Marxist rebels into handing over their most valuable captives to military helicopters flown by pilots posing as aid workers .
" Thank you for your impeccable operation , " a thin but radiant Betancourt told military commanders after being flown to the capital , Bogota .
" The operation was perfect . "
Composed and eloquent despite the day 's emotions and drama , the former presidential candidate added another twist when she said she still hoped " to serve Colombia as president " .
Dressed in a camouflage jacket and hat , the 46 - year - old stepped off an air force plane into the arms of her mother , Yolanda Pulecio , who had waged a tireless campaign for her freedom .
They embraced and gazed at each other amid applause from military officers , family and friends .
Pale but apparently healthy , Betancourt removed her hat to reveal intricately braided dark hair , with plaits and a white flower framing a beaming face .
She thanked the Colombian and French governments and expressed hope for peace in Colombia .
Relatives expressed amazement that the gaunt figure glimpsed in harrowing videos had returned .
" It is the most beautiful news of my life , " said her teenage son , Lorenzo Delloye - Betancourt .
The elaborate military sting " will go into history for its audacity and effectiveness " , said the defence minister , Juan Manuel Santos .
" We wanted to have it happen as it did today , " said General Freddy Padilla , the head of the armed forces .
" Without a single shot .
Without anyone wounded .
Absolutely safe and sound , without a scratch . "
Analysts said the breakthrough could signal the demise of Farc .
" For the Farc this is a mortal blow .
They will never be able to recover from this , " said Alfredo Rangel , director of the Security and Democracy Foundation in Bogotá .
The US president George Bush phoned Colombia 's president , Álvaro Uribe , an ally whose security forces are funded by Washington , to congratulate him .
Nicolas Sarkozy , the French president , who had made Betancourt 's liberty a priority , also spoke to Uribe and dispatched his foreign minister , Bernard Kouchner , to Bogota .
According to Santos the 15 hostages , who included three US defence contractors and 11 Colombian soldiers and police , were freed in southwestern Guaviare province after intelligence agents infiltrated the guerrillas ' leadership and led the commander in charge of the hostages , Cesar , to think they were to be taken by helicopter to Alfonso Cano , the Farc 's supreme leader .
The hostages , who had been divided in three groups , were taken to a meeting point where two helicopters piloted by Colombian military agents were waiting .
The helicopters took off with the hostages , Cesar and one other rebel , and those two " were neutralised " during the flight , Santos said .
When told that they were free , and not in fact on their way to another Farc camp , the hostages were ecstatic , said Betancourt .
" The helicopter almost fell from the sky because we were jumping up and down , yelling , crying , hugging one another .
We could n't believe it , " she said .
The government estimates Farc still holds about 700 hostages , many of whom have languished for years in grim conditions .
Betancourt , an outspoken politician , was abducted in February 2002 as she was running for president as an outsider .
She became a symbol of the hostages ' plight .
Images of her face adorned vigils and marches around the world .
As punishment for repeated escape attempts the mother - of - two was tied and chained up and became sick .
The last images of her in captivity showed a frail , despondent woman with lank hair and a blank gaze .
" In all these years , I thought that as long as I was alive , as long as I continued to breathe , I must continue to hope , " she wrote in a letter released at the end of 2007 .
" I do n't have the strength I used to have . "
Yesterday 's news caught her family by surprise .
" I am filled with happiness , " Betancourt 's sister , Astrid , told Colombian radio .
" These have been long years of waiting . "
Clara Rojas , a political ally who was kidnapped along with Betancourt and freed in January , called the rescue " a blessing from God .
I think that meeting again with her children is going to be fundamental for her . "
The three American captives , Marc Gonsalves , Keith Stansell and Thomas Howes , were US defence department contract workers who fell into rebel hands in 2003 after their light aircraft crashed in the jungle during a counternarcotics operation .
Sitting by the window of a posh coastal hotel in Half Moon Bay , Calif. , wearing a baby - blue sweater and khakis , Ian Wilmut does n’t project the image of a scientist who pulled off one of the most dramatic experiments in modern biology .
When he and his collaborators unveiled Dolly the cloned sheep in 1997 , they ignited the embryonic stem cell research field , struck awe in the public and set off a panic about the imminent cloning of humans .
“ Dolly was a big surprise to everyone , ” recalls stem cell biologist Thomas Zwaka of the Center for Cell and Gene Therapy at the Baylor College of Medicine .
Cloned frogs had refused to grow past the tadpole stage , and a seeming success in mice had proved to be a fake .
According to scientific consensus back then , cloning adult mammals by the method Wilmut used was biologically impossible .
As Dolly matured , the cloning technology that created her — called somatic cell nuclear transfer ( SCNT ) — grew into a rich research enterprise .
Scientists hoped to eventually be able to take a patient ’s cell , place its nucleus into an unfertilized human egg and then harvest embryonic stem cells to treat intractable conditions such as Parkinson ’s disease .
But the first human clinical trial continues to seem remote , with embryonic cloning constrained by a federal funding ban , deeply controversial ethical issues and technical challenges .
In mid-May safety concerns led the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to put on hold a bid by Geron Corporation in Menlo Park , Calif. , to conduct trials on patients who have acute spinal cord injury .
Now the 64 - year - old Wilmut is one of several high - profile scientists who remain loyal to SCNT in concept but are leading a wholesale charge out of the field and into an alternative technology .
That other approach , first demonstrated in 2006 by Shinya Yamanaka of Kyoto University , restores adult cells back to an embryonic­like state called pluripotency , in which they regain the ability to develop into any kind of cell .
Any well - appointed lab can apply the comparatively straightforward technique .
“ It ’s really easy — a high school lab can do it , ” says Mahendra Rao , who heads up the stem cell and regenerative medicine business at Invitrogen , a life sciences corporation based in Carlsbad , Calif .
Yamanaka ’s approach also enables scientists to leap over nuclear transfer ’s egg supply problems and sidestep qualms about destroying human embryos .
Such practicalities , rather than a lack of inherent scientific value , seem to be driving the SCNT exodus .
Wilmut describes his own switch in approach as a by - product of time - consuming responsibilities at the helm of the Scottish Center for Regenerative Medicine in Edinburgh , a post he assumed last year after nearly three decades at the nearby Roslin Institute .
With 20 principal investigators demanding his attention , Wilmut ’s research on amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS ) had slowed to a crawl .
“ We thought it would be more likely that things could be made to happen quickly , ” he says .
Somatic cell nuclear transfer demands enormous skill and expensive equipment .
It is easy to damage the unfertilized egg and hard to get the donated nucleus to operate in concert with its new host .
Last fall Oregon Health & Science University researchers announced the first - ever success in primates — but the team went through 304 eggs from 14 rhesus macaque females to generate just two cell lines .
And one of those had an abnormal Y chromosome .
In humans the ability to collect fresh oocytes also remains a huge roadblock , especially because scientists cannot legally pay donors .
Yamanaka ’s ability to convert adult mouse cells into embryoniclike stem cells — called induced pluripotent stem cells ( iPS cells ) — has pumped fresh excitement into regenerative medicine .
In this process , scientists use viruses to deliver three to four genes into an adult cell and to reprogram it back to its unspecialized state , enabling it to grow into any type of cell in the body .
In a span of months , Yamanaka ’s team and three others reported success using human cells from adult skin and joint tissue and newborn foreskin .
Now it ’s hard to find a lab concentrating solely on embryonic cloning .
Jamie Thomson , the first to pluck viable cells from a human embryo and grow them in culture , for instance , recently took charge of an institute focusing primarily on iPS cells .
Although the technique is inefficient so far — less than 1 percent of cells become pluripotent — scientists see the iPS approach as a speedier path to cells suitable for disease research and , ultimately , the clinic .
With iPS , Wilmut enthuses , his team can study cell lines instead of wrestling to get them .
“ All you have to do is take some skin cells from somebody who apparently has inherited the disease , scatter some ‘ magic dust ’ on them and wait for three weeks , ” he says .
“ And you ’ve got pluripotent cells . ”
Wilmut and his collaborators , including George Daley of Children ’s Hospital Boston and Chris Shaw of King ’s College London , hope to use iPS cells to pinpoint mutations involved in ALS .
The method still does not promise quick cures .
In ALS , for instance , researchers must speed up disease development and co-culture the various cells involved in the condition .
Scientists would like to avoid retroviral vectors , risky because they deliver the genes randomly into the chromosome .
Moreover , the new genes might vary in activity level , turn on in surprising ways or negatively influence other genes .
Some teams succeeded in making iPS cells without the tumor - producing gene that Yamanaka used , but they also found that , as a result , they ended up with many fewer iPS cells .
Scientists do not fully understand how iPS reprogramming works — the inserted genes might represent a core regulatory circuit , or they might activate other genes .
It is also not clear whether the results subtly differ from embryonic stem cells .
No one yet has grown the two and made a side - by - side comparison , and survival after transplantation remains an unknown for both .
The iPS cells may force biologists to throw out accepted ideas about what it means to be a differentiated cell , says Zwaka , whose lab is studying characteristics of embryonic stem cells .
Perhaps , he suggests , it is not necessary to take an embryonic cell through every step of development to create a particular cell type .
There may be a set of “ master regulators ” that would enable , say , a skin cell to become an adult neuron without passing through the embryonic state .
Despite leaping on the iPS bandwagon , Wilmut and other cloning pioneers insist that embryonic stem cell research should continue .
SCNT has offered important lessons about basic biology and will continue to enable studies of cell programming and reprogramming outside the genome .
Only embryonic cells can answer questions about fertility and very early human development .
Scientists will also likely rely on SCNT to produce mammalian models of diseases such as cystic fibrosis and for agricultural applications such as producing human proteins in animal milk .
“ It ’s simply too early to start putting one avenue over another , ” says Daley , who is also president of the International Society for Stem Cell Research .
His lab is using both SCNT and iPS to understand pluripotency .
Daley fears that public sentiment may turn against embryonic work and dash hopes that a new U.S. administration will open up opportunities to clone new cell lines for research .
Indeed , as scientists turn their attention elsewhere , opponents of embryonic cell research have seized on the moment to attack .
“ There is no valid reason for any human cloning ” or embryo destruction , wrote Tony Perkins of the Family Research Council .
It is hard to escape the sense that SCNT research is on the wane .
The ethical barriers and short egg supply remain daunting .
If iPS pans out , Wilmut predicts , nuclear transfer to produce cell lines may one day become a history lesson .

Dear Cecil : I 'm reading World War Z by Max Brooks , a fictional account of the world 's response to a zombie outbreak .
In the book the U.S. military fails miserably in its first real battle against the undead but later changes tactics and ultimately triumphs , as does the rest of the world .
I have always wondered how the U.S. military would realistically fight the undead .
I hope you can answer .
agibson
Cecil replies :
You ’re absolutely right , A. — this is a situation that calls for realism .
Were we realistic about Iraq ?
No .
You see what happened .
If I have anything to say about it , we wo n’t make that mistake twice .
We need to understand the zombie threat before we can formulate a practical plan for combating it .
A review of zombie movies tells us they have the following common characteristics : they ’re generally slow , stupid , and unaffected by bodily damage , they do n’t have working circulatory or respiratory tracts , they ’re not fazed by heat or cold , they ca n’t drown , and their thought processes are degraded to the point that shock and awe do n’t have an appreciable psychological effect .
This leaves you with basically three options : immobilize them and leave them to rot , decapitate them or destroy their brains ( they apparently do still have central nervous systems , demonstrating that even a modicum of intelligence can be a fatal flaw ) , or obliterate them entirely .
In The Zombie Survival Guide ( 2003 ) , which remains the definitive and possibly only treatment of the subject , Max Brooks recommends for hand - to - hand combat something that can efficiently slice zombies into bits , a two - handed Japanese katana ( samurai sword ) being ideal .
( Also receiving high praise are the compact yet deadly WWI trench spike and the much larger and deadlier ancient Shaolin monk ’s spade . )
Brooks says forget about chain saws — no matter how cool they are , they just are n’t reliable enough and require fuel , which may run out at a critical juncture .
Firearms are a good choice if used properly — you need to aim for the head , rather than waste ammunition on the body .
Even a zombie cut in half with automatic weapon fire can still crawl toward you .
An old - style combat rifle such as the M1 Garand is perhaps your best bet .
The semiautomatic action conserves bullets , and the heavy stock ( useful as a bludgeon ) and detachable bayonet give you options when the ammo is gone .
The living dead have no fear of fire , which makes it a great weapon .
Zombies engulfed in flames will not only not put themselves out , they ’ll continue to wander around , possibly setting other zombies alight .
Electricity will paralyze zombies but usually not kill them outright unless it also sets them on fire and so is n’t advisable as a first line of defense .
You might think that nuclear weapons would be a good possibility if a city were 100 percent infected , but the downside is that any surviving zombies will be not only shambling horrors but radioactive too .
So what would our military do ?
Even though the standard - issue M - 16 is inferior to the Garand , we have lots of troops and bullets , assuming they ’re not all tied up indefinitely in the Middle East .
Since zombies can’t breed except by spreading their infection , containment and quarantine would be necessary to protect uninfected urban areas — typically the sort of job assigned to FEMA , which we may want to rethink .
After that , the military could surround and wipe out the zombies using time - honored ( and very Hollywood ) tactics such as high explosives , incendiaries , and massed gunfire .
The army and marines would likely do the heavy lifting , with air force and navy fighters providing close air support .
As long as the military can protect the troops from infection and is n’t handcuffed by liberal politicians who really want the zombies to win , we should be able to handle things .
Strategy and using the stupidity of zombies against them is key , as exemplified in Brooks ’s recounting of what he tells us was the largest zombie outbreak in history — 121 AD in Scotland .
( Also the home of the Picts , who fought naked while painted blue .
Combat in ancient Scotland was definitely a trip . )
Using funneling trenches , flaming pitch , and swords , a Roman force of 480 men was able to dispatch 9,000 zombies with only 150 casualties .
If faced with zombies controlled by a sorcerer or other evil power ( as in the classic 1932 film White Zombie ) , you might save yourself some trouble by having Special Forces teams take out the head guy , though this approach is hardly foolproof — again , witness Iraq .
The main thing is , do n’t underestimate zombies .
So often in trying times one thinks , these brain - dead losers can’t possibly continue .
Yet somehow they do .

UFC 88 Chuck Liddell Vs. Rashad Evans Fight Video
Chuck Liddell , former UFC light heavyweight champion , was knocked out by newcomer Rashad Evans 1:51 into the second round at UFC 88 Saturday night in Atlanta , GA .
Evans delivered a one punch knockout to Liddell 's jaw , sending him crashing face - first to the canvas for several minutes .
38 - year - old Liddell , a key figure in the rise of the sport , has lost three of his last four fights , two by knockout , but is n't talking retirement .
" I 'm fine .
A guy caught me , " Liddell said after the loss .
" What you want me to say ? "
" I 'll decide in the gym whether or not to retire .
Not after a fight , " he said .

Does it really matter which party is in charge when it comes to bailing out the Wall Street hustlers whose shenanigans have bankrupted so many ordinary folks ?
Not if the Democrats roll over and cede power to the former head of Goldman Sachs , the investment bank at the center of our economic meltdown .
What arrogance for Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson — who the year before President Bush appointed him treasury secretary was paid $ 16.4 million for heading the company that did as much as any to engineer this financial travesty — to now insist we must blindly trust him to solve the problem .
Paulson is demanding the power to act with “ absolute impunity , ” said Sen. Christopher Dodd , D - Conn. , who admonished the treasury chief : “ After reading this proposal , it is not only our economy that is at risk , Mr. Secretary , but our Constitution as well . ”
Clearly , it ’s a vast improvement to have Dodd in the chairman ’s seat of the Senate Banking Committee , asking the right questions , rather than his predecessor , Texas Republican Phil Gramm , who presided over the committee in the years when the American economy , long the envy of the world , was viciously sabotaged by radical deregulation legislation .
Gramm , whom Sen. John McCain backed for president in 1996 , pushed through the financial market deregulation that has brought the American economy to its knees .
Maybe this time Congress wo n’t give the financial moguls everything they want , including a bailout for foreign - owned banks like Swiss - based UBS , where Gramm now hangs out as a very well paid executive when he ’s not advising the presidential campaign of McCain , his old buddy and partner in crime .
Oops , sorry , no crimes were committed because the deregulation laws Gramm pursued and McCain faithfully supported decriminalized the financial scams that have proved so costly .
Just check out the language of Gramm ’s pet projects , the Gramm - Leach - Bliley Act of 1999 and the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000 .
By preventing mergers between the various branches of Wall Street , the former act reversed basic Depression - era legislation passed to prevent the sort of collapse we are now experiencing .
The latter legitimized the “ swap agreements ” and other “ hybrid instruments ” that are at the core of the crisis .
The legislation ’s “ Legal Certainty for Bank Products Act of 2000 , ” Title IV of the law — a law that Gramm snuck in without hearings hours before the Christmas recess — provided Wall Street with an unbridled license to steal .
It made certain that financiers could legally get away with a whole new array of financial rip - off schemes .
One of those provisions , summarized by the heading of Title III , ensured the “ Legal Certainty for Swap Agreements , ” which successfully divorced the granters of subprime mortgage loans from any obligation to ever collect on them .
That provision of Gramm ’s law is at the very heart of the problem .
But the law went even further , prohibiting regulation of any of the new financial instruments permitted after the financial industry mergers :
“ No provision of the Commodity Exchange Act shall apply to , and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission shall not exercise regulatory authority with respect to , an identified banking product which had not been commonly offered , entered into , or provided in the United States by any bank on or before December 5 , 2000 . … ”
Even some Republicans on the Senate committee expressed exasperation Monday with the swindles that they had voted for with such enthusiasm in the past , as well as with giving Wall Street yet another blank check .
Sen. Jim Bunning , R - Ky. , condemned Paulson ’s proposal as an effort to “ take Wall Street ’s pain and spread it to the taxpayers . ”
He added , “ It ’s financial socialism and it ’s un-American . ”
He ’s wrong on that last point , for what is proposed is not the nationalization of private corporations but rather a corporate takeover of government .
The marriage of highly concentrated corporate power with an authoritarian state that services the politico - economic elite at the expense of the people is more accurately referred to as “ financial fascism . ”
After all , even Hitler never nationalized the Mercedes - Benz company but rather entered into a very profitable partnership with the current car company ’s corporate ancestor , which made out quite well until Hitler ’s bubble burst .
Smell a rat if Congress approves the Paulson plan without severely curtailing CEO pay and putting a freeze on the mortgage foreclosures that are threatening to destroy the homes of millions of Americans .

The new documents were not included in the 9/11 Commission ’s final report .
Astounding newly released FBI documents obtained via the Freedom Of Information Act show that alleged 9/11 hijacker Hamza Al - Ghamdi had booked future flights to San Francisco and Riyadh , suggesting that he was unaware of his eventual fate aboard United Airlines Flight 175 , the plane that hit the World Trade Center ’s south tower .
The papers consist of a 300 page Federal Bureau of Investigation timeline ( PDF link ) that was used by the 9/11 Commission but not made public until now .
The 9/11 Commission failed to mention in its final report that Al - Ghamdi was booked onto several flights scheduled to take place after 9/11 , including another flight on the very day of the attacks .
The fact that Al - Ghamdi had booked post - 9/11 flights obviously gives rise to doubts about whether the alleged hijacker knew the 9/11 attack was a suicide mission and even brings into question if he was on the flight at all .
Citing “ UA passenger information , " on page 288 under an entry pertaining to “ H AlGhamdi , ” the FBI timeline reads : " Future flight .
Scheduled to depart Los Angeles International Airport for San Francisco International Airport on UA 7950 , " reports Raw Story ( excerpt below ) .
Flight information contained in FBI timeline used by the 9/11 Commission and recently released through a Freedom of Information request .
Al - Ghamdi was also booked to fly on September 20 , 2001 from Casablanca , Morocco to Riyadh , Saudi Arabia and September 29 , where he planned to fly from Riyadh to Damman , Saudi Arabia .
The FBI timeline documents also contradict with several other details of the 9/11 Commission Report , notably on the movements of alleged Flight 77 hijackers Nawaf al - Hazmi and Khalid al - Mihdhar .
According to researcher Paul Thompson , he believes the Commission cherry - picked the dates of the alleged hijacker ’s movements in order to shield their ties with high - level Saudi Arabian officials .
He points to the redaction of the name of a person who is a known employee of a Saudi defense contractor , Omar al - Bayoumi , who lived at the same location , reports Raw Story .
“ We know it ’s Bayoumi , ” said Thompson , “ because after 9/11 , the Finnish Government mistakenly released a classified FBI list of suspects that showed Bayoumi living in apartment # 152 of Parkwood Apartments . ”
That information is available here .
“ But also important is that it strongly suggests that the hijackers already had a support network in Southern California before they arrived , ” Thompson continued .
“ In the official version of the story now , the hijackers drift around L.A. listlessly for two weeks before chancing to come across Bayoumi in a restaurant [ according to Bayoumi ’s account ] , ” Thompson added .
“ Whereupon he ’s an incredible good Samaritan and takes them down to San Diego , pays their rent , etc . ”
” But from the FBI ’s timeline , we now know the hijackers started staying at Bayoumi ’s place on Jan. 15 – the very same day they arrived , ” Thompson says .
“ So obviously they must have been met at the airport and taken care of from their very first hours in the US .
That ’s huge because the FBI maintains to this day that the hijackers never had any accomplices in the US . ”
Alleged Hamza Al - Ghamdi appears in his " martrydom tape , " which interestingly enough was only released in September 2006 , post - 9/11 just like his flight plans were .
Former 20 - year veteran CIA case officer Robert Baer , who has previously asserted that 9/11 has aspects of being an inside job , told Raw Story that the new developments immediately demand the 9/11 investigation be re-opened .
“ There are enough discrepancies and unanswered questions in the 9/11 Commission report that under a friendly administration , the 9/11 investigation should be re-opened , ” wrote Baer .
“ Considering that the main body of evidence came from tortured confessions , it ’s still not entirely clear to me what happened on 9/11 , ” he concluded .
Raw Story provides further details concerning how the documents shed more light on the role of Saudi authorities and their complicity in the attack .
These new revelations mark the most astounding 9/11 - related developments in many months and are sure to kick of a firestorm of new doubts about the crumbling official government story .

Several pictures purporting to show Banksy have appeared over the years Mysterious graffiti artist Banksy is a 34 - year - old former public school pupil called Robin Gunningham , The Mail On Sunday has claimed .
The paper says it has identified the " guerrilla artist " from a photograph taken four years ago in Jamaica , which shows a man kneeling by a spray can .
But a spokeswoman for Banksy refused to comment on the report .
" We get these calls all the time , " she told the BBC .
" I 'll say what I always say : I never confirm or deny these stories " .
Banksy 's stencilled artwork appears unannounced in public spaces around the world .
In January a piece of his graffiti in Portobello Road , west London - which shows a painter finishing off the word " Banksy " - attracted a bid of £ 208,100 in an online auction .
But the artist is also renowned for his audacious stunts - such as leaving a life - size replica of a Guantanamo Bay detainee at Disneyland in 2006 .
His fiercely - guarded identity only adds to his subversive appeal - and members of the Hollywood elite including Christina Aguilera and Angelina Jolie have snapped up his paintings .
' Extremely talented ' Banksy 's graffiti is highly collectable , but is often removed by local councils
The only solid biographical fact about the artist is that he was born and raised in Bristol .
It has often been rumoured that his real name is Robin Banks and that his parents think he is a painter and decorator - but no - one close to Banksy has ever verified these stories .
Now , the Mail on Sunday claims to have uncovered his true identity .
The newspaper says it traced the artist using a photograph purporting to show Banksy at work in Jamaica in 2004 .
Former friends and acquaintances identify the man in the picture as Robin Gunningham .
Scott Nurse , who went to the £ 9,420 - a- year Bristol Cathedral School with Gunningham , tells the paper he was " extremely talented at art " .
" I am not at all surprised if he is Banksy , " he is quoted as saying .
Luke Egan , an artist who later exhibited with Banksy initially denied knowing Gunningham , but eventually agreed he had shared a flat with him .
Asked by the paper whether Gunningham was Banksy , he replied : " Well , he was n't then " .
Gunningham 's father Peter said he did not recognise the person in the photograph , while his mother Pamela maintained she had never even had a son .
' Crushing disappointment '
The picture the Mail claims is of Banksy was taken by Jamaican photographer Peter Dean Rickards .
It first appeared on the internet and then in the Mail 's sister publication , The Evening Standard , in 2004 .
The artist 's stencils often convey subversive political messages Banksy 's agent Steve Lazarides told The New Yorker that Rickards ' picture did not depict his client - although Colin Saysell , an anti-graffiti officer in Bristol who has followed Banksy for years , concluded the photo was legitimate .
Two years later , Banksy insisted the public should never discover who he is .
" I have no interest in ever coming out , " he told Swindle magazine .
" I 'm just trying to make the pictures look good ; I 'm not into trying to make myself look good .
" And besides , it 's a pretty safe bet that the reality of me would be a crushing disappointment to a couple of 15 - year - old kids out there . "

What are these ?
Presidential debates are important -- and the first debate is the most important of all , establishing an arc of opinion that persists unless jarred loose by big mistakes or dramatic events .
So whether this year 's first presidential debate between Sens.
Barack Obama and John McCain is Friday night or postponed a few days , it may be the fall 's most critical event .
In the nine first debates since 1960 , the perceived winner of the debate averaged a 4.2 point net swing in the Gallup poll .
Mr ....
It ’s 11 p.m .
Do you know where your lube is ?
My boyfriend and I are making out and it ’s starting to get hot and heavy .
I mean we ’re like really going at it .
He reaches for a condom but then ...uh - oh .
“ We ’re out of lube , ” he announces reluctantly .
Because I ’m super horny and want avoid an ass of fire , I go : “ That ’s okay .
Let ’s just go to Walgreen ’s and pick some up . ”
That ’s right .
Walgreen’s .
There are no sex shops in New Haven because , obviously , nobody has sex at Yale .
So there we are , smack in the middle of foreplay , putting clothes back on and going to Walgreen ’s for a bottle of lube .
I do n’t know if you know this , but the “ I ’m About to Have Hot Sex ” section at Walgreen ’s is actually more evangelically called “ Family Planning . ”
Awkward .
This , I believe , is their strategy straight out of the Sarah Palin playbook to discourage premarital sex .
I ’m not sure if I should be picking out lube or a boarding school for what is apparently my planned but still unborn child .
KY ?
Wet ? Astroglide ?
Hmm .
We make a selection and head towards the cashier to pay .
Except that there are 100 billion people waiting on line versus a single cashier who seems to enjoy taking her time rolling people ’s purchases across that scanner .
Because I am unbelievably impatient , I brilliantly opt for the Cosmetics cashier , which always has fewer people waiting .
Uh -oh number two .
The line is shorter , as I expected , but the cashier is my favorite old black lady with super big hair and even bigger glasses .
She ’s like my BFF every time I go to Walgreen’s .
I always go to her line to buy , like , chapstick or whatever and she gives me discounts .
But if I buy lube from her it ’s going be like I ’m saying : “ Hi old black lady !
Not only am I about to have gay sex immediately , but here this is the boy that ’s going to do it . ”
Awkward .
But I tell you the worst part of the whole debacle is that the old black lady reminds me of my grandmother .
So now I really ca n’t buy the ass gel from her .
“ Oh my God we can not buy the lube from her . ” I say to Daniel ’s laughter .
Me : “ I mean ... maybe we can even it out if we throw in something domestic like , um , fabric softener . ”
Am I completely alone here when I say that buying lube / condoms / vaginal creme / adult diapers / anti-fungal spray / foot odor power , etc. can be embarrassing ?
Like what if you ’re a hot guy who ’s super duper endowed and need to buy , I do n’t know , Ultra Magnum condoms AND jock itch creme ?
Do you really want folks to know that ?
It ’s like : “ Hi , I have a huge cock , and right now it really itches . ”
I mean , it ’s not like I ’ve never had to buy lube before .
You gotta keep your goodie drawer stocked like you do your refrigerator .
Imagine going for that much desired bowl of Apple Jacks and — uh - oh — no milk !
But what sucks ultra hard is that I do n’t think there are any goodie marts within walking distance of Yale .
So I typically rely on those little shops that dot 8th Ave. or Christopher St. in New York .
Much more anonymity .
Besides , at least there they know what you want before you walk through the door .
No shame in yo’ game .
What was so embarrassing to me about Walgreensgate was not just the grandma presence , but that I felt a Sarah Palin judgment placed on my sex life via the title “ Family Planning . ”
This is obvi not the place for gay men and dykons .
Clearly , it ’s where Biff and Buffy go when — and only when — they realize they ’re ready to start a family .
I wish I was n’t so embarrassed about buying lube .
Sex is sex , right ?
Many of you may in fact be having sex any minute now .
I think the embarrassment I attach to it , though , was built into me during my teenage years .
One time I came home to my grandmother who had found — and watched — this 70s gay porn tape I borrowed from a friend .
Of course , she angrily asked me if I was a gay .
I swore up and down that I was n’t , and masterfully lied that I needed the tape for a “ class project . ”
If only that “ class project ” were the boys ’ locker room .
But the more I think about it , the more I realize that if it were n’t for her anger at my watching gay porn or my being on the precipice of permanent gaydom , I probably would n’t be so nervous about buying lube at Walgreen ’s from a lady who reminds me of her .
Parents should talk to their teens openly about sex .
Talk to them about gay sex and straight sex since you might not know — and they might not either — if they are a homo or heterosexualist .
No more of this “ Family Planning / Abstinence / Forced Babies ” malarkey .
No matter what Sarah Palin says , people are going to have sex , and there is no sense in making them feel guilty about it .
You know , by forcing a young girl keep an unscheduled baby .
Educating folks about sex is way better than punishing them for being curious .
I would love to see the day when I could confidently buy lube from the old black ladies or whomever , and instead of being chastised or judged , they simply looked me in the eye and said , in a deep , raspy voice ...
“ Enjoy ! ”
Or at least the day when Walgreen ’s invests in a self - check out .
During Saturday 's audit of Pima County ( Tuscan ) ballots from Arizona 's primary election , official observer John Brakey was forcibly removed by sheriffs when he raised questions about possible ballot tampering .
At least seven ballot bags arrived unlocked or lacked proper chain of custody documentation .
Elections Director Brad Nelson had Brakey arrested and charged with criminal trespass .
" I was doing my job ! "
Brakey said , who represented the Democratic and Libertarian parties in an official capacity at the state - mandated audit .
" The first thing you do is check the seals .
Are the ballot bags locked ?
Do the numbers on the seals match the seal number listed on the documentation inside of the bag ?
This lets us know that the ballots were properly stored and sealed by election workers , and arrived with chain of custody intact . "
( Image by Unknown Owner ) Details DMCA
Brakey 's attorney , Bill Risner , called the noon arrest " outrageous . "
He plans to enter his appearance on Monday and will seek a trial on this matter .
He wants Nelson and the sheriffs to explain , on record , their removal of an election official who questioned improperly received ballots .
Risner explained :
" It 's a bad situation here .
We have an incompetent Elections Director who is working against the interests of our political parties .
Nelson is intentionally creating confusion and slowing things up to blame the Democrats for his own internal problems .
" I 'd be surprised if the prosecution proceeds .
The whole essence of the crime requires that he be shown to have been unlawfully present at the counting center . "
Election Defense Alliance is covering the story and dug up this television news video of the incident from KGUN TV , Pima AZ .
Fatally FlawedTheMovie.com posted this lengthier video providing deeper coverage of the arrest .
Brakey noticed that seals on three ballot bags arrived broken .
He then asked nine counting teams if the documentation inside the bag , known as the " End of Day Certification Reports , " were properly completed .
At least seven bags did not contain the legally required documentation .
" You can't count those ballots – there 's no chain of custody , " Brakey advised .
When ballot bag seals are not properly affixed , anything could have happened to the ballots from the time they left the poll site on the 2nd .
A break in chain of custody , or lack of proper documentation of that custody , precludes any rational basis for confidence in ballots being audited .
Brakey observed the opening of one bag by Director Nelson , who pulled out a scrap of paper with two signatures scrawled on it .
Brakey questioned this , but Nelson assured him he knew those election workers and deemed those signatures valid .
" How can he know them ?
You could n't even read those signatures , and there are 3,000 poll workers in the county . "
According to the Arizona Daily Star , Nelson estimates incongruities were found with only two or three of 18 bags , likely caused by poll - worker errors on election night .
While Nelson admits that asking questions is appropriate , he added that inquiries should be directed to him and not to the ballot - counters .
" He refused to direct questions to me , " Nelson said .
Brakey advised he only spoke with ballot counters who were chit- chatting , and did not interrupt them from work .
After ascertaining that a bag had not been properly sealed or documented , he " advised them to watch for discrepancies . "
That 's when Brakey was asked to leave the building .
But he refused to leave until Pima County Sheriffs handcuffed and physically removed him .
Witnesses were shocked at the rough treatment , imploring the officers to go easy .
" He 's got a broken wrist .
Be careful ! "
Brakey 's cast was recently removed , but the wrist is still tender .
" I 've got a little swelling there now , but it 's fine , " he said on Sunday .
" But I squealed in pain when the cuffs were squeezed . "
Brakey is a co-founder of Arizona - based AUDIT - AZ , which stands for Americans United for Democracy , Integrity and Transparency in Elections .
He also helps coordinate the Investigations Unit of Election Defense Alliance .
Election observation is a critical task that advocates have long promoted .
Brakey agrees :
" The problems we have with our elections are on the inside .
The solution is on the outside . "
reports Both Pima County and Diebold had opposed the release of information on how voters voted , citing security issues and Diebold 's claim of ‘ proprietary trade secrets . ’
Brad Friedmanthat Brakey is the “ citizen hero ( and yes , a community organizer ! ) who helped shepherd the landmark lawsuit recently brought by the Pima County Democratic Party resulting in the release of Diebold database files showing how voters actually voted in a 2006 election and earlier .
The databases were sought after fraud was ( and still is ) suspected in a number of important elections and ballot issues .
Both Pima County and Diebold had opposed the release of information on how voters voted , citing security issues and Diebold 's claim of ‘ proprietary trade secrets . ’
“ The lawsuit was successful , as the judge ultimately disagreed with the County , leading to the largest release of such databases ever in this country . ”
Attorney Bill Risner was lead counsel in that lawsuit .
上記サイトの方は皮肉で返すそうですが、毎回皮肉を言うのも疲れるでしょうし、人間関係にも良くありません。
それに、あなたが製作者なら、まず社内の営業やディレクターに、何故無料じゃまずいのかを説明する必要があるかもしれません。
なので、どうしてこういう問題が発生するのか？を考えておく必要があります。
まあこんな喧嘩腰は流石に無いのですが、話自体は結構身の回りにもあります。
うっかりすると営業さんが「はい、ちょこっとなんで無料でやっちゃいます」と、引き受けてきてしまいます。
１度なら良いのですが、それがかさんで思わぬ赤字が出ることも稀ではありません。（というか、結構多い）
ここで紹介されていた以下の事例は、案件見積もりの全てを工数計算で行っていると発生するトラブルです
チョコ１個×１０００と、チョコ１０００個は同じ値段？
少しならいいじゃん、と思ってしまう人の考え方は
「 ４０時間かかる仕事で２０万円なら、１時間５０００円じゃん？３０分なら２５００円じゃん？
それくらいだったら無料にしてくれてもいいじゃん。何なら俺が同じくらいの飯おごってもいいよ。」
と、こういうわけです。
安易に考えてしまうとこの理論に同意してしまいがちなのですが、実際には４０時間が２０万円でも３０分は２５００円ではありません。
分かりやすいものの値段で言うと、あるチョコレートが１個２０円だったとします（昔は１０円だったのになぁ）
これを１０００個買えば２万円ですね。
でも問屋に行って箱買いすれば違います。もっと安くなります。
山手線の１０Km区間は１６０円です。
それじゃあ１Kmだと１６円なのかと言うと、１３０円もします。
大きな商売になるほど、１つあたりの単価は下がっていきます。
逆に小さな商売は１個の単価が異様に高かったりします。
これは、どの料金に対しても量に関わらない固定費用が存在しているからです。
電車で言えば初乗り料金、
つまり、切符を作るお金だとか、改札機を動かすお金、安全を守るお金、駅や電車の許容人数を維持するお金、
そういうものが、プログラムやデザインや企画制作にも存在しているわけですね。
先方とのメールのやり取りや会議、キックオフ手続き、案件の経理的な処理や、契約書なんかはどうやっても固定でかかります。
それと絶対に忘れてはいけないのは、製作者が頭を切り替えるにはそれなりのコストがかかるということです。
８時間の案件を１日中集中できる人でも、３０分の案件を１６種類渡されて集中し切る事は凄く難しいことです。
それぞれに、先方チェックやデバッグがあるのなら、他案件の作業をしている間も頭のリソースをそっちに残しておかなければなりませんので、当然能率は下がります。
（平行作業の方が得意な人間もいますが、基本的にプログラマの多くはデュアルコアプロセッサではありません。）
もちろん固定費用が全てではないので、床屋の例のように何をしても同じ値段というわけではないのですが。
初乗り料金を設定しよう
こういった値段の差で起きるトラブルを回避したいのなら、最初から料金表に「基本料金」とか項目として明記してしまうのも良いです。
もちろん今まで時間工数で付き合っていた相手には難しいですし、そうでなくとも
「 うちはこういうのがかかりますが、他社は時間工数に入れているだけなので値段は変わりません。」
みたいな説明は必要になってきますが。
あと、初乗り料金があるということはセット販売ならお得ということですね。
最初に要件を全部出しておいてくれたり、関連する小さい案件はまとめて会議しちゃうとお得になりますよー、と。
実際費用もその通りだし、余計な苦労を抱え込まなくてすみますし、上手く使えば営業トークとしても機能します。
ただし、細かい料金設定はデメリットもあります。
特に大型案件ばっかり扱っている場合、後の変更なんかは一括して契約にまとめちゃう方が良かったりするので、そこは考えどころですね。
最近は人月計算そのものも見直されているところが多いみたいです。
昔は１行いくらのプログラム（今では考えられない）があったという話もあるくらいなので、料金というのはだんだんと実態に即した方へ移り変わっていくものなのでしょう。
そういう流れに取り残されないようにするためにも、仕事ってどこにどれだけお金がかかるんだろうねー？という考えはいつも持っていたいですね。

WASHINGTON–A conservative columnist who welcomed Sarah Palin 's entry in national politics says she 's proven to be a dud and should step aside as Republican presidential candidate John McCain 's running mate .
Kathleen Parker , writing in the National Review Online , says her " cringe reflex is exhausted " after watching the Alaska governor stumble through TV interviews and it's become clear to her that Palin is out of her league .
" No one hates saying that more than I do , " Parker writes .
" Like so many women , I 've been pulling for Palin , wishing her the best , hoping she will perform brilliantly .
I 've also noticed that I watch her interviews with the held breath of an anxious parent , my finger poised over the mute button in case it gets too painful .
Unfortunately , it often does . ''
Palin , new to national politics , boosted McCain in polls and excited the party 's core conservatives when he chose the first - term governor for his ticket .
Some of that shine has since worn off in polls .
Parker said she thought Palin was a " refreshing feminist of a different order " when she joined the ticket , but it 's become clear she does n't know enough about economics or foreign policy to be president should that become necessary in a McCain administration .
" Only Palin can save McCain , her party , and the country she loves , " Parker writes .
" She can bow out for personal reasons , perhaps because she wants to spend more time with her newborn .
No one would criticize a mother who puts her family first . ''
Palin , meanwhile , said Thursday she will donate to charity more than $ 1,000 in campaign contributions from two Alaska politicians implicated in a federal corruption probe .
Palin said she also is giving back $ 1,000 from the wife of one of the men .
The move came a few hours after The Associated Press reported Palin had accepted the money during her successful 2006 run for governor .
She was elected easily after she promised to rid Alaska 's capital of dirty politics .
Palin took aim at gift - giving to state officials as part of her ethics agenda but received thousands of dollars ' worth of gifts since she took office nearly two years ago .
State records dating back to 2006 , when Palin took office , show that she or her family received 29 gifts valued at about $ 14,500 .
Also yesterday , Alaska Attorney General Talis Colberg filed suit in Anchorage yesterday to block a legislative investigation into Palin 's firing of the state 's police chief .
The governor says the legislative probe is politically biased .
Why , this is downright preposterous !
How dare the copyright - ignoring , astonishingly uncreative minds of those at Miao copy Apple 's latest iPod nano design a full year in advance ?
They should be implausibly embarrassed by churning out a so - called Cottage MP3 player in 2007 , all while the brains at Cupertino sat and pondered how to make its tiny little PMP that much better .
This , people , is an outrage .
An outrage !
Women are too shy to break through the glass ceiling , says female scientist
Women have only themselves to blame for failing to break male - dominated hierarchies in the workplace , a behavioural scientist claims .
Shannon Goodson claims that women are still far more timid than men in the office , after comparing almost 11,500 female professionals with 16,700 male workers in 34 countries for her latest book The Psychology Of Sales Call Reluctance .
She said women in Britain , her native US and China were the most likely to speak up about their achievements , whereas those in New Zealand and Sweden remained fearful of appearing ' unladylike ' .
Glass ceiling :
But it 's not men's fault , says new research , it 's women's
The research also found that women who reach positions of power tend to sabotage the chances of female workers below them .
Men , on the other hand , are happy to promote themselves - sometimes lying to do so .
" Women did not create the glass ceiling , the invisible barrier blamed for limiting their ability to earn what they 're worth , but they help maintain it , " Goodson said .
" Being able to draw attention to your contributions and competencies at work has become an important part of modern career management , and it is something most women are still unwilling or unable to do as consistently as their male counterparts , " she added .
Goodson 's research found that while most men had no qualms about touting their contributions , and even sometimes lying about them , women still cling to the myth that self - promotion is " socially unacceptable " , " unladylike " and " morally suspect " .
" They believe hard work alone is sufficient to put them on salary and status par with their male counterparts , " she said .
" Good work is important , but good work alone does not , as the myth says , speak for itself , you have to give it a voice . "
Goodson 's research also found that women who had managed to climb up the corporate ladder tended to " take the ladder with them " , sometimes even sabotaging the chances of other female workers seeking promotion .
This part of the study , which was conducted mainly in the United States , revealed women executives may not be as encouraging or supportive of female staff .
" This led many women in the study to actually prefer male managers to female managers , claiming men are more consistent and fair - minded than women , " Goodson added .
Goodson said professional women in Britain , the United States and China were more likely to promote their interests , whereas women in New Zealand and Sweden are the most timid , followed by Australian and Canadian women .
But overall , women were not doing enough to advance their own careers , she said in a statement .

None of them have come close to convincing me that George W. Bush and his neocon cronies were either evil or , more important , smart enough to have orchestrated the terrorist attacks on the United States .
Perhaps that ’s because I ’m one of the media gatekeepers that the “ 9/11 truth movement ” is fond of blaming for its lack of visibility and credibility .
( According to Barrie Zwicker ’s Towers of Deception : The Media Cover - Up of 9/11 , Mother Jones is part of the “ phony ‘ left ’ media ” co-opted by the “ diaboligarchy . ” )
But I ’ve held on to my growing library of 9/11 skepticism both as an artifact of an unpopular delusion and a guilty pleasure .
In spite of my shadow - government puppet masters , I find the “ Truthers ' ” mix of feverish delusions and all - American idealism oddly entertaining .
So when a couple of feature - length 9/11 conspiracy movies recently landed on my desk , I felt a twinge of anticipation .
The Reflecting Pool and Able Danger are , as far as I can tell , the first thrillers inspired by Truther theories .
Maybe , I thought , these films would have a dash of paranoid style .
And just maybe they ’d have what ’s missing in the online hall of mirrors that spawned the 9/11 truth movement — coherence .
These films are another sign of the endurance of the biggest conspiracy theory since — pick your favorite — the cia / the Mafia / Castro killed JFK .
September 11 truthiness will be one of the many bad hangovers of the Bush years .
A 2006 Scripps Howard poll found that 36 percent of Americans think the government was somehow behind the attacks .
Significant numbers also subscribe to the Truthers ’ various hypotheses for how it all went down : 16 percent said that the World Trade Center was actually destroyed by hidden bombs ; 12 percent said the Pentagon was not hit by an airplane , but a missile .
( The survey did not tally the popularity of other nuggets of — Truther lore , such as the idea that 7 wtc was purposely demolished , that Flight 93 was shot down , that Mohammed Atta was a patsy , or that no planes hit the twin towers . )
A handful of celebrities — Rosie O’Donnell , Charlie Sheen , Willie Nelson — have recited parts of the Truther catechism .
There is 9/11 conspiracy folk music ( Jesse Goplen ’s “ Controlled Demolition ” ) and hip - hop ( Mos Def and Immortal Technique ’s “ Bin Laden , ” which declares , “ Bush knocked down the towers ” ) .
But the closest thing to a breakout work of pop culture is Steve Alten ’s The Shell Game , a Clancyesque thriller in which neocons try to best their 9/11 scheme by detonating a suitcase nuke in Los Angeles and pinning the blame on Iran .
What better way , then , to popularize an only - in - the - movies version of reality than with a movie ?
It ’s telling that the director of Loose Change , the best - known series of 9/11 conspiracy documentaries thus far , originally planned to write a screenplay for a fictional thriller .
The Reflecting Pool and Able Danger aspire to be conventional movies ; they adhere to the formula for conspiracy thrillers , from The Parallax View to The Da Vinci Code .
Both follow a protagonist whose discovery of the awful truth is confirmed by the mobilization of powerful forces intent on silencing him .
Yet while most conspiracy flicks rely on viewers to check their BS detectors at the door , the 9/11 movies do n’t want you to suspend your disbelief .
Just the opposite :
They want you to walk away a believer .
Fittingly , The Reflecting Pool begins with a journalist receiving a 9/11 conspiracy video .
Lead character Alex Prokop , a reporter for a liberal California newsmagazine , is initially wary of questioning the official story .
But in the first of many journalistic sins , he teams up with Paul Cooper , a 9/11 “ researcher ” — one of the exalted Googlemaniacs who form the truth movement ’s brain trust .
Cooper ’s daughter died when Flight 11 supposedly hit the north tower , and he ’s pursuing a rico suit against half the government .
Aside from that , he ’s a totally reliable source .
Prokop and Cooper interview a parade of composite characters who rehash the conspiracy movement ’s greatest hits .
Prokop does n’t swallow every wacky hypothesis ; he flips out after a Deep Throat - style meeting in a parking garage with a guy who rants about “ holographic technology . ”
Then he and Cooper go back to their hotel room and use wooden blocks and model airplanes to deduce that the Pentagon must have been hit by a missile .
While The Reflecting Pool is plodding and pedantic , Able Danger at least tries to make the preposterous fun .
Shot in a neonoir style , its hero is Thomas Flynn , an affectless Brooklyn hipster who ’s written his own alternate history of 9/11 .
A mysterious Central European woman finds him , claiming to be in possession of a hard drive containing evidence of official foreknowledge of the 9/11 plot .
After getting his hands on her MacGuffin , Flynn gets tangled in a web of deception and cartoonish characters , such as Luther , a cravat - wearing , Muhammad - praising baddie who sounds like a B - movie Nazi : “ Vat shall ve talk about ? ”
Able Danger tips its tinfoil trucker ’s cap to The Maltese Falcon , but its other inspiration appears to be Enemy of the State , the 1998 thriller in which Will Smith is stalked by an all - seeing National Security Agency .
The high - tech surveillance team that ’s tracking Flynn identifies him as a “ high - value target : anti-regime propagandist . ”
When the men in black drag Flynn into an suv , one reminds him , “ Do n’t think because you operate in a little café in nowheresville Brooklyn that you ’re not being watched . ”
Just because you ’re paranoid does n’t mean the government is n’t reading your blog .
Needless to say , the Truthers have yet to find their Chris Carter or Oliver Stone .
These movies repackage 9/11 skepticism in an accessible format , but they ’re practically inscrutable without descending further into the rabbit hole .
Able Danger can only be understood by reading The Big Wedding by Sander Hicks , an indie journalist whose version of 9/11 involves an alliance of Islamists , neo - Nazis , technofascists , and a Republican “ pedophilia cult . ”
And God help you if you turn on the droning filmmakers ’ commentary on The Reflecting Pool dvd .
But the most annoying thing about the movies — and the Truthers — is that the actual truth , in all its awful complexity , is n’t enough for them .
No matter that 3,000 Americans died because of bungling and blowback , or that the Bush administration twisted their deaths into pretexts for unnecessary war and executive power run amok .
The Truthers want more .
They ’ve missed the real lesson of the Bush administration , which is not that a secretive cabal runs the White House , but that its diabolic intent has been trumped by its staggering incompetence .
Seven years on , the neocon notion that imperial power can reshape reality has been fully exposed as a fantasy .
Yet the Truthers cling to the myth of official omnipotence , making them some of the last Americans who still believe that this administration could successfully pull off anything bigger than T - ball on the South Lawn .
To be sure , the Bush administration has made it all too easy to succumb to conspiratorial thinking .
Due to official stalling and stonewalling , the full story of September 11 remains a work in progress .
The 9/11 Commission ’s official account glossed over uncomfortable questions but read like a page - turner .
Fittingly , a nation hungry for answers gobbled it up ; nearly 9 million copies of the report were sold or downloaded , and it enjoyed a second life in comic - book form .
The 9/11 skeptics have tapped into this desire for answers — a common Truther refrain is that they ’re “ just asking questions . ”
But that ’s like proponents of intelligent design saying they do n’t know how the universe was created .
The Truthers are n’t filling in the gaps in our reality ; they ’re already living in an alternate one .
As Don DeLillo , no stranger to the power of conspiracy theories , observed shortly after 9/11 , the terrorist attacks were a profound break in our narrative about how the world works and America ’s place in it .
“ The narrative ends in the rubble and it is left to us to create the counternarrative , ” he wrote in Harper‘s .
That was before the Bush administration stepped in and wrote a counternarrative in which the United States was locked in an endless existential battle with a fathomlessly evil foe .
The dubiousness of that hastily improvised scenario is now apparent .
Yet the 9/11 truth movement ’s narrative is just as maddeningly inadequate — and unimaginative — as the neocons ’ .
— A parallel universe inhabited only by patriots and pawns is an intriguing place to spend a couple of hours if you ’re watching 24 or a movie like Able Danger .
But it ’s not the world we must face after the final credits roll .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Stocks rallied Friday , with the Dow rising 369 points , as the government 's plan to help rescue banks from toxic mortgage debt soothed investors at the end of a gut - churning week on Wall Street .
Treasury prices plunged and gold prices tumbled as investors bailed out of safe - haven plays and poured money into equities , reversing the flight - to - safety trend of earlier in the week .
Oil rallied more than $ 6 a barrel .
The dollar jumped nearly 2 % versus the yen , but fell versus the euro .
The Dow Jones industrial average ( INDU ) added nearly 369 points , or 3.3 % .
Including Thursday 's big rally , the Dow 's two - session advance was 779 points , the biggest since March 2000 , according to Dow Jones .
On a percentage basis , the two - session advance of 7.3 % was the biggest since October 2002 .
The Standard & Poor 's 500 ( SPX ) index jumped 4 % .
The Nasdaq composite ( COMP ) gained 3.4 % .
Small cap stocks jumped too , with the Russell 2000 ( RUT ) up 4.1 % .
The economy still has work to do , and the problems in financials have not disappeared as a result of today 's announcements , but confidence has been restored , said Fred Dickson , chief market strategist at D.A. Davidson & Co .
" It 's a seminal moment in the crisis , " Dickson said .
" It does n't mean we 're out of the crisis , but the net impact is that people will feel more comfortable investing again . "
Friday 's session capped a stunningly volatile week on Wall Street , in which , for example , the Dow 's daily ricocheting between lows and highs added up to a more than 2800 - point run .
However , for the week , the Dow closed down less than 34 points .
Looking forward , the stock market will be stronger for a while then it otherwise would be , but this does n't mean the bear market is over , said Ryan Atkinson , market analyst at Balestra Capital .
" Once investors absorb all of this , they will realize that while this keeps the banking system from imploding , which is good , it does n't change the broader issues , " Atkinson said .
Those issues include the weak labor market , sluggish consumer spending , and the slowing global economy .
( How effective will the plan be ?
Bailout plan :
The federal government is establishing a plan that will allow banks to get soured mortgage - related assets off their balance sheets , a move seen as key to stemming the 15 - month - old credit crunch .
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson outlined the plan Friday , saying that it would likely cost " hundreds of billions of dollars " and that it needs to be substantial enough to have maximum impact .
( Full story )
" We 've figured out a plan that could restore health to the financial system , " said Phil Dow , director of equity research at RBC Wealth Management .
He cautioned that it does n't mean stocks are now set to rise , but that it does change the fundamentals of the financial services sector , which is important .
" This may prove to be a big watershed for U.S. financials because it could allow the banks to benefit again from rising stock prices and to clear their balance sheets , " Dow said .
Money markets :
As part of the broad effort to restore stability , the Treasury Department and Fed both announced steps Friday to shore up the nation 's money market fund industry , which has stumbled this week amid the financial market crisis .
( Full story ) .
The Treasury said it will insure up to $ 50 billion in money - market fund investments at companies that pay a fee to participate in the program .
The yearlong initiative guarantees that the funds ' value will not fall below the standard $ 1 a share .
Dickson said this is perhaps the most significant development announced Friday , in that it insures that funds will be available to millions of depositors .
" The number one fear for investors has been ' With banks going under , where do I put my money ? ' " he said .
" This addresses that . "
At the same time , the Fed will lend an unlimited amount of money to banks to buy asset - backed paper - short - term debt issued by corporations - from money market funds .
These holdings have come under pressure as investors cashed in a record $ 169 billion in money market assets in the past week .
Short - selling ban :
And in an attempt to limit the plunge in financial stocks , the Securities and Exchange Commission is temporarily banning the short - selling of nearly 800 financial stocks .
Short - selling is a process in which traders place bets that a stock will fall .
Shorting has been seen as partly responsible for the accelerated bloodletting in financial stocks this summer .
( Full story ) .
The U.K. took similar steps to limit short - selling Thursday .
The short - selling ban is a good short - term means of helping finance companies pull out of their slump , said Art Hogan , chief market strategist at Jefferies & Co .
The ban also probably helped fuel Friday 's advance by causing all the short - sellers to jump in and buy shares back .
( But for a look at why the ban could be a mistake longer term , click here . )
On a broad level , the day 's announcements are key to helping restore stability .
" Whether it 's tangible or emotional , we 're getting markets back up to where they should be , " Hogan said .
Financial crisis :
The developments were critical at the end of an extraordinary week that began with Lehman Brothers ( LEH , Fortune 500 ) filing the biggest bankruptcy in history .
Also this week : Merrill Lynch ( MER , Fortune 500 ) was bought by Bank of America ( BAC , Fortune 500 ) in a $ 50 billion stock deal ; AIG ( AIG , Fortune 500 ) narrowly avoided bankruptcy after the Fed bailed it out with an $ 85 billion bridge loan , and speculation swirled about the fates of Morgan Stanley ( MS , Fortune 500 ) , Goldman Sachs ( GS , Fortune 500 ) and Washington Mutual ( WM , Fortune 500 ) .
Friday 's news seemed to cool fears , giving a boost to all the companies that were at the source of the panic .
Merrill rose 34 % , Bank of America gained 23 % , AIG rose 43 % , Morgan rose 21 % , Goldman rose 20 % and WaMu rose 42 % .
Among other financial sector gainers , Citigroup ( C , Fortune 500 ) jumped 24 % .
The company is reportedly considering making a bid for WaMu , according to the Wall Street Journal .
Wachovia ( WB , Fortune 500 ) , rumored to be in talks with Morgan Stanley , gained 29 % . JP Morgan Chase ( JPM , Fortune 500 ) advanced 17 % .
The Philly KBW Bank ( BKX ) index soared over 12 % and the Amex Securities Broker / Dealer ( XBD ) index climbed 17 % .
( Full story )
Other movers :
Tech shares rallied , including Oracle ( ORCL , Fortune 500 ) , which reported higher quarterly earnings that beat estimates , on higher revenue that missed estimates Thursday night .
Shares climbed 7 % Friday .
Cisco Systems ( CSCO , Fortune 500 ) , Apple ( AAPL , Fortune 500 ) , IBM ( IBM , Fortune 500 ) and Hewlett - Packard ( HPQ , Fortune 500 ) all gained as well .
Telecom shares jumped , including Sprint ( S , Fortune 500 ) , Ciena ( CIEN ) and Dow stock AT&T ( T , Fortune 500 ) .
Gains were broad - based , with 23 of 30 Dow components rising .
Among the gainers : GM ( GM , Fortune 500 ) climbed 14 % , GE ( GE , Fortune 500 ) rose 7 % and Chevron ( CVX , Fortune 500 ) gained 6 % .
Market breadth was positive and volume was very heavy .
On the New York Stock Exchange , winners topped losers 7 to 1 on volume of just short of 3 billion shares .
On the Nasdaq , advancers beat decliners by over 3 to 1 on volume of 4.05 billion shares .
Volume was exacerbated by the quarterly options expiration , an event in which stock index futures and options and individual stock futures and options all expire simultaneously .
This can cause volatility in the underlying stocks .
Fuel prices :
Oil prices rallied , with U.S. light crude oil for October delivery climbing $ 6.67 - the second biggest one - day dollar gain ever - to settle at $ 104.55 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange .
Oil prices had been plummeting since peaking at $ 147.27 a barrel on July 11 , as investors bet that sluggish global growth will diminish oil demand .
But over the last few sessions , prices have been bouncing back .
Other markets :
In global trade , European and Asian markets rallied .
Treasury prices tumbled as investors pulled money out of the safe - haven investment and poured it into stocks .
The slump boosted the yield on the benchmark 10 - year note to 3.73 % from 3.54 % late Thursday .
Treasury prices and yields move in opposite directions .
Over the last few sessions , bond prices have been surging , sending the yields to multi- month lows as frantic equity investors have looked for other places to park their money .
Gold prices had been surging for the same reason .
On Friday , COMEX gold for December delivery fell $ 32.30 to settle at $ 864.70 per ounce after jumping over $ 116 per ounce over the last two sessions .
In currency trading , the dollar fell against the euro and rallied 1.5 % against the yen .
Gas prices fell for the second straight day Friday , after tumbling for eight days in a row in the aftermath of Hurricanes Gustav and Ike .

Cao Lei of China tries a lift during women 's 75 kg group A competition of the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games weightlifting event in Beijing , China , Aug. 15 , 2008 .
Cao Lei set the new Olympic record of women 's 75kg snatch with 128 kg .
[ Yang Lei/ Xinhua Photo ]
Few girls want to put on weight , neither does Cao Lei , who is renowned for her beauty consciousness in China 's national weightlifting team .
However , she has to do that in order to become an Olympic champion .
Cao , 1.68 meters tall , made debut in the national championships in 1999 , only finishing eighth in the women 's 63kg .
Two years later , she claimed the title at the Asian championships when she was 16 years old .
In the same year , she took part in the ninth National Games , getting another eighth place in the women 's 63kg , which upset her and made her to upgrade to the 69kg class .
It worked .
In 2005 , Cao won in the 69kg class at the National Games , which entered her into the national weightlifting team .
At that time , Cao has already got the nickname of " weightlifting beauty " .
Sydney Olympic champion Yang Xia said that when she first met Cao when they were trained together in 1999 , Cao did n't look like a weightlifter at all .
" She was slim and tall , really pretty , " Yang said .
Born in north China 's Hebei Province and growing up in northeastern Heilongjiang Province , Cao was a born beauty .
She practiced track and field in childhood and won golds in some city games .
When she was nine years old , a local weightlifting coach picked her up .
She thought weightlifting interesting as her father , who was a part - time weightlifter and wrestler , had taught her to do weightlifting with mops at home .
She never thought that his coach Ma Wenhui would discuss with her on upgrading into the 75kg category .
If the 69kg category is acceptable , 75kg is not the same thing .
" I never expected to be in 75 kg .
It is too heavy and I do n't want to look fat , " she said .
However ,
She had no other choices but putting on weight for a better future in the highly competitive national team .
Her teammate , Olympic champion Liu Chunhong , was unbeatable in the 69kg class .
Cao had no chance to win over her .
She thought it over and over during the vacation she took after getting hurt during the training sessions in February 2006 , and finally began to eat , a lot .
" It 's a difficult decision for me to make , but now everything goes smoothly , " she said .
She won two golds , clean and jerk and total , in 75kg category at 2006 world championships , gold at Asian Games late 2006 , and again gained two golds at 2007 world championships .
" The only thing which makes me upset is that I can't wear the clothes I bought last year , " she said .
That 's why she keeps a lighter bodyweight in the 75kg category , usually around 73kg .
During a pre-Games training session , all her female teammates took sauna or went jogging in order to lose weight .
Cao ran for a little while and stood there looking at them .
" I do n't need to lose weight , " she told curious reporters , kind of proudly .
In Friday 's event , Cao was the lightest athlete , weighing 73.16 kg , among the total 12 strongwomen .
However , the 24 - year - old lifted the heaviest weight of 282 kg in total , breaking three world records .
It 's the first time Chinese lifter won gold in this category .
She had her eyebrows delicately shaped before the Games and wore a pair of earstuds during the competition .
Cao said she did n't want to wear all the clothes she currently has .
Instead , she would fit herself for clothes of smaller sizes if one day she retired from weightlifting .
" The most beautiful moment in my life is standing on the podium to collect the Olympic gold , " she said .

Covid -19 is much deadlier than the seasonal flu .
For one thing , it can lead to life - threatening complications such as acute respiratory failure .
That ’s why social distancing is so important — it ’s the only way to slow down the spread of the virus .
It ’s also the reason why so many people are working from home .
Are you working from a home office ?
Need some tips on how to remain productive ?
If so , you ’re on the right page .
We ’ll be going all that you need to know below .
Keep reading to learn more !
What is Social Distancing ?
Social distancing , aka physical distancing , is one of the best ways to reduce the spread of illness during an outbreak .
It involves making lifestyle changes to minimize close contact with others .
As a general rule , you want to maintain a distance of at least 6 feet from other people .
Crowded places should also be avoided .
If possible , stay at home as much as possible .
4 Ways to Stay Productive While Working at Home
Having difficulty staying productive at home ?
Here are some tips that might help motivate remote workers !
1. Stick with the Same Routine
Just because you ’re not going into the office does n’t mean that you should skip your usual routine .
In other words , wake up at the time you usually do , shower , and get dressed — it ’ll set you up for the workday ahead .
If possible , keep a set schedule .
For example , if you usually work 8 - 4 , do the same at home , otherwise , it ’s easy to lose track of time .
2. Get Some Fresh Air
While it ’s true that you want to limit contact with other people , it does help to get fresh air every once in a while .
For example , you can go for a short walk during your break — just make sure to distance yourself from others and wash your hands once you get home .
Alternatively , you can open the windows so that some of the fresh air will come into the room .
3. Create a Work Space
Avoid the urge to work from your bed .
It might be comfortable but it ’s definitely going to affect your productivity .
Ideally , you want to work from a desk — just like what you ’d do at the office .
Keep distractions such as game consoles and television away so that you ’ll be able to get more done .
4. Prepare for Disruptions
Have children at home ?
It might be difficult to get things done but it is possible .
You just have to plan ahead .
For example , you can put on a special movie for them in another room — one that they can only watch while you ’re working .
That way , they ’ll be less likely to interrupt you .
Working From Home Effectively
And there we have it — four tips for those who ’re social distancing by working from home .
As you can see , there are a number of things that you can do to boost your productivity !

The software tries to detect whether , when the crime ’s details are recited , the brain lights up in specific regions  the areas that , according to the technology ’s inventors , show measurable changes when experiences are relived , their smells and sounds summoned back to consciousness .
The inventors of the technology claim the system can distinguish between people ’s memories of events they witnessed and between deeds they committed .
The Brain Electrical Oscillations Signature test , or BEOS , was developed by Champadi Raman Mukundan , a neuroscientist who formerly ran the clinical psychology department of the National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences in Bangalore .
His system builds on methods developed at American universities by other scientists , including Emanuel Donchin , Lawrence A. Farwell and J. Peter Rosenfeld .
Despite the technology ’s promise  some believe it could transform investigations as much as DNA evidence has  many experts in psychology and neuroscience were troubled that it was used to win a criminal conviction before being validated by any independent study and reported in a respected scientific journal .
Publication of data from testing of the scans would allow other scientists to judge its merits  and the validity of the studies  during peer reviews .
“ Technologies which are neither seriously peer - reviewed nor independently replicated are not , in my opinion , credible , ” said Dr. Rosenfeld , a psychologist and neuroscientist at Northwestern University and one of the early developers of electroencephalogram - based lie detection .
“ The fact that an advanced and sophisticated democratic society such as India would actually convict persons based on an unproven technology is even more incredible . ”
After passing an 18 - page promotional dossier about the BEOS test to a few of his colleagues , Michael S. Gazzaniga , a neuroscientist and director of the SAGE Center for the Study of the Mind at the University of California , Santa Barbara , said : “ Well , the experts all agree .
This work is shaky at best . ”
None of these experts have met the Indian inventors and the investigators using the test .
One British forensic psychologist who has met them said he found the presentation highly convincing .
“ According to the cases that have been presented to me , BEOS has clearly demonstrated its utility in providing admissible evidence that has been used to assist in the conviction of defendants in court , ” Keith Ashcroft , a frequent expert witness in the British courts , said in an e-mail message .

PETER KIRSANOW at the National Review is enraged .
Quoting the debate , he says
Obama concludes by saying " I do n't think any of us can say that our standing in the world now , the way children around the world look at the United States , is the same . "
CLANG .
Explaining his fury , he writes that
Criticizing George Bush or any of our other political leaders is one thing .
Contending America 's ideals and values are somehow suspect is a breathtaking statement for a prospective commander in chief to make , especially when thousands of Americans have given life and limb , sons and daughters , in brave demonstration of our ideals and values .
Come again ?
Barack Obama did not say that " America 's ideals and values are somehow suspect . "
He said what everyone on earth knows .
Worldwide , America is vastly less respected and loved than it was before George Bush .
That is not because those ideals are suspect , but because the current government has tarnished America 's reputation for upholding them , beyond recognition to many former fans of America .
The rule of law , habeas corpus , torture , not starting wars unnecessarily ...
These were America 's values .
Now , as the kids say , not so much .
Are there still people out there who do not see the damage to America 's global leadership wrought by the Bush administration ?
Apparently there is at least one .

Tip How to Cook Bacon Bacon is most commonly cooked on the stovetop or in the oven .
If you ’re opting for the former , start with a cold pan with the bacon strips touching , but not overlapping .
Set the burner on low and allow the bacon to slowly release its fat .
As it begins to cook , use tongs to flip the strips and fry them on their opposite sides .
Continue to flip and turn until the bacon is browned evenly .
Let the cooked bacon drain by carefully placing them on paper towels or a newspaper .
To cook bacon in the oven , simply line a large baking sheet with aluminum foil and arrange the bacon strips on its surface .
If your baking sheet does not have grooved edges , be sure to fold the aluminum corners upwards to catch excess grease .
Bake at 400 °F for ten to 20 minutes ( depending on your texture preference ) , remove , and place bacon strips on paper towels or a newspaper .
The bacon will crisp as it cools .
Tip How to Store Bacon
Pre-packaged bacon has an impressive shelf life , but not once it ’s opened .
While it ’s best to freeze uncooked bacon , the slices can be tightly wrapped in aluminum foil and stored in a ziploc bag for up to a week .
The same storage technique should also be applied to fresh bacon purchased directly from the butcher .
Tip How to Freeze Bacon Bacon actually holds up quite well in the freezer , though its peak flavor quality will only last one to two months .
To freeze , you may keep the bacon in its original packaging , but wrap around it with another layer of aluminum foil , plastic wrap , or freezer paper .
Just be sure to keep your freezer at a consistent zero degrees for optimal freezing results .
Tip Why Do We Celebrate Christmas on Dec. 25 ?
There are several reasons Christmas is celebrated on Dec. 25 .
The date is nine months after March 25 , a day recognized by Christians as Annunciation .
It was the day Mary was told she would was having a baby .
The nine months that follow are an approximation of Jesus ’ birth .
Dec. 25 also coincides with pagan Winter Solstice celebrations like Saturnalia ' and Dies Natalis Solis Invicti .
Since they were historically celebrated around that time of year there was precedent for holiday festivities during this time of year .
Tip What Does the Name ' Christmas ' Mean and What Is the Meaning of Christmas ?
Christmas is a shortened from the words “ Christ ’s mass . ”
It ’s derived from the Middle English word " Cristemasse " which has Greek , Hebrew and Latin origins .
Christmas is an annual holiday that honors the birth of Jesus Christ .
It is celebrated by Christians around the world and is regarded as an important religious and cultural holiday .
Tip How Can We Celebrate Christmas ?
Christmas is traditionally celebrated in many ways and celebrations vary across cultures .
In the days leading up to Christmas , people usually put up special decorations including colorful lights and evergreen trees .
Gifts are often placed under the tree and exchanged on Christmas day among loved ones .
Large meals are also typically served as part of the celebration as well .
Tip How to Freeze Pork Pork fares best in the freezer if packaged with freezer - friendly materials like waxed paper , aluminum foil , or heavy - duty plastic bags .
Wrap any meat tightly so that air does not escape and freeze at 0 °F .
Generally , fresh cuts of pork can last up to six months , while ground pork can last up to three .
Tip How to Thaw Pork Pork is easiest to thaw when placed in the refrigerator in its original wrapping .
Small roasts will take three to five hours per pound , while larger roasts can take up to seven hours per pound .
Thawing ground pork depends entirely on the thickness of its packaging .
It is safe to cook frozen or partially - frozen pork , but its cooking time may take 50 percent longer .
Frozen pork should not be cooked in a slow cooker .

Tom lost at sea
Talk Like A Pirate Day to continue ; Parliamentary run ' mostly forgotten '
Special to the Ledger — MAD Cap’n
Tom , who has for nine years now run the British part of International Talk Like A Pirate Day , has been declared ‘ lost at sea ’ following days of searching by officers of Her Majesty ’s Navy and his own crewmates .
Mad Cap’n
Tom was last seen sailing westwards from the fishing harbour of Mevagissey , on the south coast of Cornwall .
Locals reported that he had seemed wistful and reflective during his short stay in the port , with one resident , known to this reporter only as ‘ Molly ’ , reporting that he had talked of ‘ new adventures ’ and ‘ lands yet to explore ’ .
He is believed to have only a few supplies on board his ship , the recently - refloated Unsinkable ; certainly not enough for a voyage to the New World of beyond .
( paper torn )
... after his now mostly - forgotten bid for Parliament during the last general election .
Over the years that Mad Cap’n Tom has been involved with Pirate Day , the day has raised many thousands of pounds for charities large and small .
“ I be havin ’ no regrets . ” , said Mad Cap ’n
Tom in a recent interview .
“ Talk Like A Pirate Day be an incredible adventure for most o’ me last decade , and fer most o’ me adult life .
It be a privilege an’ an honour to be part o’ it on this sceptred isle .
Being this person — this Cap ’n — well , it be teachin’ me many things .
I be havin ’ so many wonderful memories .
“ Most importantly , me hearty — I cannot say ‘ thank ye’ enough t’ all th’ thousands o’ people who be involved over the years .
That , more than ’ anythin ’ , be stayin ’ wi’ me as I sail onward . ”

Tom is survived by his duck , Brian .
Daily Show : Inflating your tires ' only encourages the terrorists ' David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Thursday August 7 , 2008
Print This Email This On Wednesday 's Daily Show , Jon Stewart took on Senator John McCain 's insistence that offshore drilling is the answer to our energy problems .
" We need to drill here !
We need to drill now ! " McCain recently demanded .
" The administration 's own Department of Energy says the effects of drilling now would n't even be felt until 2030 , " Stewart objected .
" Unless we could somehow whittle that figure down ? "
" Oil company executives say that it could be as short a time as one to two years , " McCain has stated .
On another occasion , he suggested it could be just " a matter of months . "
" Drilling offshore has already saved us ! " Stewart exclaimed .
" Cyborgs from the future have been sent here to drill offshore to prevent Osama bin Laden from killing John Connor ! "
Stewart acknowledged that even Barack Obama , who was insisting in June that " my job is not to go with the polls , " has now announced that his own plan " does include a limited amount of new offshore drilling . "
" Damn ! " said Stewart , but he added , " To be fair , Obama released an energy plan that included a comprehensive list ... touching on everything from investing in alternative energy to turning off your lights to making sure your tires are inflated . "
" My opponent does n't want to drill ! " demagogued McCain in response to Obama 's plan .
" He does n't want nuclear power !
He wants you to inflate your tires ! "
" Senator McCain took his message of ending our dependence on oil to the annual Sturgis Motorcycle Rally and Crystal Meth Olympics in South Dakota , " Stewart went on , showing McCain telling the bikers , " I 'll take the roar of 50,000 Harleys any day . "
" Any day that we 're not locked in a global battle with oil - producing terrorist states , " Stewart interjected .
" I recognize that sound , " McCain declaimed over the noise of many engines .
" It 's the sound of freedom ! " " No , it 's the sound of money being funneled to Saudi Arabia , " corrected Stewart .
After playing a few clips of the licentious Miss Buffalo Chip beauty contest , for which McCain had jokingly volunteered his wife , Stewart noted , " To sum up , tuning up your cars and keeping your tires inflated is unbelievably gay and only encourages the terrorists , but stationary yet still - roaring engines combined with banana - fueled oral sex demonstrations are ... " " ... the heart and soul of America ! " McCain cried out .
" After all that , " concluded Stewart , " this is what McCain said yesterday .
' Senator Obama a couple of days ago said that we ought to all inflate our tires , and I do n't disagree with that . ' "

In a letter to the C.I.A. on Saturday , Assistant Attorney General Kenneth L. Wainstein , who heads the Justice Department ’s National Security Division , requested to meet with Mr. Helgerson and Mr. Rizzo early next week to discuss the inquiry .
Mr. Rodriguez , who could not be reached for comment , announced his retirement from the agency this summer .
The New York Times has made a request through an agency spokesman to speak with him .
Officials have acknowledged that the destruction of evidence like videotaped interrogations could raise questions about whether the C.I.A. was seeking to hide evidence of coercion .
A review of records from military tribunals indicates that five lower - level detainees at Guantánamo Bay , Cuba , were initially charged with offenses based on information provided by or related to Abu Zubaydah .
Military defense lawyers said the fact that interrogation tapes were destroyed could provide a way to challenge other cases that may be based on information from Abu Zubaydah , though such challenges would face major legal obstacles under the current rules for military prosecutions .
They said the defense could argue that the tapes might have raised questions about whether the information was believable or whether Abu Zubaydah had invented it simply to stop aggressive interrogation techniques .
Col. Steven David , the chief military defense lawyer for the Guantánamo war crimes cases , said at a trial , “ The inference is they destroyed it because it was bad for them . ”
He said the disclosure of the destroyed tapes “ raises serious concerns ” about other potential prosecutions , but it was too early to say how many , or how serious the damage might be .
In any case based on information from Abu Zubaydah , defense lawyers could raise the issue of the destroyed tapes as a way to challenge the case .
From a defense lawyer ’s perspective , Colonel David said , “ the issue becomes what is lost , what is destroyed , what else has been destroyed and what else is out there that we are not aware of . ”
Abu Zubaydah and Mr. al - Nashiri , who is said to be the chief planner of the 2000 attack on the Navy destroyer Cole , are the only suspected Qaeda figures identified so far as the subjects of interrogations recorded on the destroyed tapes .
The destruction of the tapes has intensified the focus on Abu Zubaydah , who was captured in March 2002 .
As one of the first close associates of Osama bin Laden to be caught after the 9/11 attacks , Abu Zubaydah became a test case on which the C.I.A. built and then adjusted its program of aggressive interrogations and overseas secret jails in the years that followed .
Third time ’s a charm they say , and as I ’ve talked about pathfinding twice before ( in Do n’t follow the shortest path !
and Aiding pathfinding with cellular automata )
I thought I ’d charm everyone with a third pathfinding article .
This time I ’ll talk about how we can reduce the memory consumption on a commonly used pathfinding algorithm by about a magnitude !
Those of you wacky enough to have taken EE instead of CS , might know breadth - first search applied to pathfinding on a grid as Lee ’s algorithm [ Lee61 ] .
We also sometimes see this referred to as the wavefront or flood - fill pathfinding algorithm .
Odds are you ’re quite familiar with it .
An application of Lee ’s algorithm is shown below , with the depth of the breadth - first search written into the cells ( shown on the left , with start and goal highlighted ) along with an optimal path as returned from the algorithm ( on the right , with the path in golden yellow ) :
The optimal path is obtained by starting at the goal cell and finding the neighboring cell with the smallest value , then from that cell we go to its neighboring cell with the smallest value , and so on until we reach the start cell .
For an MxN grid one would think we would need to store an integer per cell , holding log 2 ( M * N ) bits , in order to represent the cell state .
But one would think wrong !
In fact , only two ( ! ) bits per cell are needed , as noted by Akers [ Akers67 ] .
Akers first noted that we do n’t really need to have labels unique to every cell ; we only need labels that are unique between a cell and its preceding and succeeding neighboring cells along any possible path .
As such , it would be possible to simply label the cells 0 , 1 , 2 , 0 , 1 , 2 , … along the BFS path .
As we also need to represent empty and filled cells we would in this encoding need 5 values or 3 bits to encode all cell values .
From there ,
Akers observed that we do n’t actually need three values , we can instead label the cells 0 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 1 , … as this encoding ( using only two values ) still allows us to infer unique labels for three successive cells along a path .
Along with the state labels for empty and filled cells , this encoding uses only 2 bits to encode all states !
The grid below shows Akers ’ algorithm applied to the same configuration as before :
Here I ’ve considered the start node as being labeled 0 .
In general , we can turn an implementation of Lee ’s algorithm into Akers ’ algorithm by rather than storing the current search depth D into the grid cell instead storing ( ( D >> 1 ) & 1 ) .
Extracting the optimal path once a goal node is reached is done analogous to in Lee ’s algorithm , but now we step to the next neighboring cell which has the appropriate value in the reverse of the sequence 0 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 1 , ….
Traditionally Lee ’s algorithm ( and Akers ’ modification ) were used to route paths on printed circuit boards .
Today there ’s a lot of published algorithms for this routing problem , and anyone pretending to be an AI expert for games should probably be familiar with not just Akers ’ algorithm but the ideas behind a few other of these EE path - routing algorithms .
A good overview of some is given in Prof.
Hai Zhou ’s lecture notes .
Several relevant papers can also be found at the ACM and IEEE digital libraries .

OSCON Billionaire , cosmonaut and founder of the fast - growing Ubuntu Linux distro Mark Shuttleworth dreams impossible dreams .
No , not a return to the stars .
He believes in something that 's far harder for mortal open source engineers to achieve .
That dream ?
To produce a desktop more beautiful to ordinary users than legions of Apple programmers supping on the milk of chief exec Steve Jobs ' alleged brilliance are capable of producing .
That includes a desktop not funded by a clutter of annoying banner or Flash - based ads , but paid for by subscription - based services .
Now you 're done dreaming , go home and code for the victory .
In a Tuesday evening O'Reilly Open Source Convention ( OSCON ) keynote , Shuttleworth called on delegates to make a concerted effort not just to catch Apple but to overtake the company in the quality of the desktop experience they deliver users .
His company Canonical , Ubuntu 's commercial sponsor , is working to make the Ubuntu desktop " more beautiful " in the next two years , he told OSCON .
" I think the great task in front of us in the next two years is to lift the experience of the Linux desktop from something stable and usable and not pretty , to something that 's art , " Shuttleworth said .
" Think of the way the iPhone uses a pure software experience , it abstracts away all the hardware , " he said .
" You can paint anything on the screen because it 's all software . "
There is the tiny question of funding open - source development .
Shuttleworth noted the demand is clearly there from companies and individuals for open - source software , but where the money comes from to support such efforts is not clear .
The noise machine of Web 2.0 and software - as - a - service ( SaaS ) is all about ads - based revenue .
Even mighty companies such as Microsoft are willing to stuff their software full of ads , which are irritating to users and cause distractions .
Just for the chance to get online ads dollars .
Carrying the banner of the TiVo generation , Shuttleworth dismissed placement of ads in desktop software as " offensive " .
He suggested ISVs should make money doing a little hard work selling services , instead .
" There is an emerging emphasis on services - that is the engine to invest in free software applications , " he said .
" We [ Canonical ] are hiring guys to work on the desktop ... the rationale is online services .
This must be a shared platform . "
According to Shuttleworth , open source provides unparalleled opportunities to generate wealth and create change through innovation .
He supported open - source projects like Firefox , which rely on plug-ins to harness other people 's ideas and extend the underlying platform .
He warned that a few challenges exist on the road to greater innovation , wealth and social change via open source .
Platform , tolerance and Linux
First , there 's a need for " platform tolerance " .
Open source must figure out how to work with rather than exclude those on Windows .
" While we can all be focused on making Linux the winning platform , we need to think about how we work with other people who work across multiple platforms , " he said .
Open source needs the participation of non-experts using tools that are simple enough for non-rock star developers to use .
" The bulk of participants in free software projects come from people around the core ...
We sometimes focus on the rock stars .
Choosing tools in our projects that make it easy for people to get stuff done and get out is a winning strategy , " Shuttleworth said .
He also returned to a familiar theme of greater cooperation between disparate projects .
Coordination of releases would be beneficial in cases where there are interdependencies , reducing bugs , helping produce a general open - source platform that could bring open source to the attention of the world at large .
" Imagine if we could talk in particular about the summer 2009 release , and there 'd be differences in the platform .
To be able to have this pulse across the entire free software ecosystem - how would that elevate the awareness we could generate in the rest of the world ? " he asked . ®
When presumed Republican presidential nominee John McCain turns 72 on Friday , it ’s likely his Democratic opponents will make sure no one forgets his birthday .
But McCain beat them to the punch line Monday night with his own jokes during a return appearance to NBC’s “ The Tonight Show With Jay Leno . ”
McCain had barely taken his seat when Leno offered him early birthday wishes : “ We were going to have a cake , but the fire marshal said ‘ that many candles ? ’ ” The late - night host added that they ’d ribbed McCain with “ a few jokes ” about his age during the campaign .
“ A few ! ” McCain said with mock indignation .
“ A few thousand jokes . ”
“ I ’ve got one , ” the candidate continued .
“ My Social Security number is 8 . ”

The Arizona senator made his TV cameo at the Burbank studio as the Democrats opened their convention in Denver .
For McCain , it was a low - key day that included an eyebrow - raising endorsement by the Puerto Rican reggaeton star Daddy Yankee at a high school in Phoenix and fundraisers in Beverly Hills and Sacramento , where McCain disclosed that his wife is headed to the war - torn Republic of Georgia to assess humanitarian needs .
After speaking to the American Legion in Phoenix this morning and to a San Diego fundraiser , McCain will return to his retreat near Sedona , Ariz . , for campaign filming and convention planning .
The appearance before a friendly audience on “ The Tonight Show ” gave McCain a chance to respond publicly to his widely ridiculed gaffe last week about how many homes he owns .
In an interview with Politico , McCain said he ’d have to check with his staff before providing an answer .

When Leno pressed McCain about how many houses he has , the senator tried to shift the conversation .
“ I ’m proud of my record of service to this country .
And it has nothing to do with houses .
What it has to do with [ is ] putting Americans in houses and keeping them in their homes , ” McCain said , drawing applause from the crowd .
In all , John and Cindy McCain and their children own eight homes held in trusts , limited liability companies and partnerships .
At McCain ’s morning appearance at the Phoenix high school , there were squeals and giggles from teenage girls -- not for him , but for Daddy Yankee , the reggaeton star .

The audience of more than 100 students seemed sleepy for McCain ’s opening remarks about the importance of voting and the national leaders who have come from Arizona .
But they perked up when he promised a “ special guest ” and “ a great American success story . ”
McCain built up the suspense by withholding the guest ’s name at first , but then gave it away , saying , “ One of his most famous songs , I know you ’re very familiar with : ‘ Gasolina ’ ” -- drawing gasps of surprise from the crowd -- and then finally said , “ Well , here he is , Daddy Yankee . ”
Though McCain has sometimes shown surprising familiarity with rap stars and pop culture references because of the musical tastes of his daughters , it is unlikely that the conservative Republican would have made a point of mentioning the song had he known that the “ Gasolina ” lyrics are loaded with sexual references .
Although there ’s some debate about what the word “ gasolina ” means in this context , one thing is certain :
It ’s not a petroleum product .

Asked whether McCain knew about the sexual allusions , a campaign spokesman said he had no comment .

Reston reported from Phoenix , Sacramento and Beverly Hills .
A new web - based attack is making the rounds that tries to spread poisonous links by hijacking end users ' clipboards .
Forum discussions here , here , here , here and elsewhere all report the same thing : the commenter surfs to a seemingly legitimate site ( MSNBC.com comes up more than once ) and suddenly a malicious link is copied to the clipboard .
The rogue link remains even after the user copies a new batch of text .
The only way to remove it is to reboot the computer .
The attack has been reported by Firefox users running both OS X and Windows , but we would n't be surprised to hear that other browsers and operating systems are also vulnerable .
It 's unclear exactly how the attack spreads .
The Spyware Sucks blog posits here that banner ads transmitting bad Adobe Flash code is responsible , and that makes sense to us .
If you 've encountered this attack , please leave a comment below detailing exactly where you encountered it .
Those behind the attack appear intent on propagating a link ( for the record , it 's xp - vista - update.net , but we recommend staying away ) that claims users '
PCs are petri dishes hopelessly infected with malware unless they are immediately cleaned by a fraudulent anti-malware program .
By permanently attaching the link to the clipboard , attackers are betting the user will paste it in emails , blog posts or directly into a browser 's address bar .
Attacks like these are another reason why running the NoScript extension on Firefox makes a lot of sense .
It 's not perfect , but it can insulate you from a huge amount of the attack code floating around on the web . ®

As we 've seen a lot that takes place on Wall Street comes from perception as well as real numbers so I think it was a smart move for Obama to ask that the FDIC insurance on our bank accounts get raised to 250K .
It gives people confidence in their banks and will ease a little tension there .
What would happen if everyone withdrew their money from from their bank out of fear ?
Talk about a nightmare .
He needs to lead on the economy and this is a good step .
" The majority of American families should rest assured that the deposits they have in our banks are safe , " Obama said in a statement put out by his presidential campaign .
" That is why today , I am proposing that we also raise the FDIC limit to $ 250,000 as part of the economic rescue package - a step that would boost small businesses , make our banking system more secure and help restore public confidence in our financial system . "
The FDIC has joined in :
In theory , the Communist Party allows citizens to lobby the central government on matters of local corruption , the illegal seizure of land and extralegal detentions .
In reality , those who arrive at Beijing ’s petition office are often met at the door by plainclothes officers who stop them from filing their complaints and then bundle them back to their hometowns .
Intimidation , beatings and administrative detentions are often enough to prevent them from trying again .
Daniel A. Bell , who teaches political theory at Tsinghua University in Beijing , suggested that Western political leaders and rights advocates were naïve to think that the Olympics would lead to looser restrictions .
Although Chinese have come to enjoy greater freedoms in the past two decades , progress has been largely stalled in the years leading up to the Olympics as officials worked to ensure that nothing would interfere with them .
In recent months , the pressure has only intensified : scores of rights lawyers and political dissenters have been detained , and even the armies of migrant workers who built the Olympic stadiums have been encouraged to leave town , lest their disheveled appearances detract from the image of a clean , modern nation .
“ When you have guests coming over for dinner , you clean up the house and tell the children not to argue , ” Mr. Bell said .
While the demands of Ms. Wu , 79 , and Ms. Wang , 77 , the protest applicants , might be seen as harmless , they threatened to expose the systemic problems that bedevil the lives of millions of Chinese .
Like many disenchanted citizens , the two women , former neighbors , were seeking to draw attention to a government - backed real estate deal that promised to give them apartments in the new development that replaced their homes not far from Tiananmen Square .
Six years later , they are living in ramshackle apartments on the outskirts of the city , and their demands for compensation have gone unanswered .
On Monday , when they returned to the police station to follow up on their protest applications , the women were told they had been sentenced to one year at a labor camp for “ disturbing public order . ”
For the moment , the women have been allowed to return to their homes , but they have been warned that they could be sent to a detention center at any moment , relatives said .
Officials say that they received 77 protest applications but that nearly all of them were dropped after the complaints were “ properly addressed by relevant authorities or departments through consultations . ”

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , in a statement that would be unlikely to go out without the Obama campaign 's approval , dismisses McCain 's suspension :
This is a critical time for our country .
While I appreciate that both candidates have signaled their willingness to help , Congress and the Administration have a process in place to reach a solution to this unprecedented financial crisis .
I understand that the candidates are putting together a joint statement at Senator Obama ’s suggestion .
But it would not be helpful at this time to have them come back during these negotiations and risk injecting presidential politics into this process or distract important talks about the future of our nation ’s economy .
If that changes , we will call upon them .
We need leadership ; not a campaign photo op .
If there were ever a time for both candidates to hold a debate before the American people about this serious challenge , it is now .
You know how doctors and elementary school principals all through the land are canceling their subscriptions to Us Weekly in the aftermath of the jihadist pinko rag 's biased coverage of Sarah Palin ?
Well today we learned there may be a " silent majority " of folks who would be doing the exact same thing with the New York Post , right here in New York , but no one hears from them because they do n't consume a few metric tons of gas just getting to work every day and are thus subjected to the presence of these innovative small businesses known as " newsstands " on a regular basis , and it is at these operations that liberal - leaning media consumers are casting their votes .
" If I had a nickel for every friend of mine who told me they stopped buying the Post every time an election cycle hit , " a Post employee told a Gawker operative today … well he 'd probably be able to afford a copy of Italian Vogue !
The point is , we know the Post 's coverage of this Palin crap has been hard on all of you .
Some of you may have quit reading it altogether !
If so , here is some stuff you 've missed .
I scanned it in so we would n't have to link !
1. From a page of Post readers " sounding off " on Palin 's performance in today 's paper also featuring this profundity from one Joe DePascale , Brooklyn : Palin gave a great speech and shows that Obama is equivalent to Julie , the activity organizer on ' The Love Boat ' TO WHICH WE CAN ONLY SAY So uh , " Hoppy " is one of those WASP nicknames that would indicate you are a card - carrying member of the plutocracy ?
Because otherwise you should be scared too , assmunch !
2. MOTOWN MAYOR PLEADS GUILTY Under " pressure " from Obama .
What is interesting about this piece is that it would appear to contain no original reporting , just a benign quote from an anonymous Obama aide quoted in the Detroit Free - Press and some bullshit from one of those " consultant " people who will say anything .
But see , what actually happened was that Obama made a public call for Kilpatrick to step down — which is different from some backroom black machine politics " mounting pressure " bullshit the piece describes — and seriously , he would n't have bothered had some outfit called Freedom 's Defense Fund not been running ridiculous , unfounded campaign ads claiming the two of them were " friends . "
Of course , the Post does not bother to tell you about that .
But hey , did you know he was called the " hip - hop mayor " ?
3. Michelle : 2 Is Enough
This ran today opposite a small piece about how " community organizers " are upset about being slighted by Sarah Palin .
What it means :
The Obamas , despite the fact that they are a lazy couple of community organizing whiners , can't handle any more than two children , because they are lazy and also " uppity , " which is an old euphemism for " babykillers . "
4 . From yesterday 's paper , wherein the Post convened a group of local women to watch the Palin speech .
To which we can only say : Jesus fuck where did they find these people ?
5 . From today 's paper , because given twenty - four hours to digest and fully consider the content of Sarah Palin 's speech , it is abundantly clear Sarah Palin looks like Audrey Hepburn .
Not that you 'd learn that in the SEXIST MAINSTREAM MEDIA .
And , just to give you an idea how many pages we considered and turned down for entry to this list , here 's a runner - up :

SINGAPORE ( Reuters ) - Energy trading heavyweight Morgan Stanley withdrew from a half - hour oil trading window in Asia on Thursday , two industry sources said as credit risk hit liquidity in cash energy markets .
Morgan ’s withdrawal came after energy price benchmarking agency Platts placed it under review because of counterparty concerns about its credit status , the sources , who declined to be identified , said .
The Platts review does not stop Morgan Stanley trading oil , but means that its bids and offers will not be taken into account during the daily half - hour “ window ” during which Platts assesses prices in over - the - counter oil markets .
“ Counterparty acceptance is a huge problem right now in commodity markets too , ” said Jorge Montepeque , Platts ’ global director of market reporting , at a conference in London .
“ We have situations where entities in the oil industry will not trade with a bank . ”
Montepeque declined to comment on Morgan Stanley .
A spokesman for Morgan Stanley in London also declined comment .
Rather than risk a possible public test of its credit acceptance among counterparties in an increasingly anxious oil market , Morgan Stanley asked its brokers in Singapore not to put prices into the Platts system , three brokers with different companies told Reuters .
But Morgan Stanley , one of the two biggest oil derivatives traders , continued to participate in over - the - counter markets through the day and there was no suggestion that it was withdrawing from OTC trade .
Being blocked from the window will reduce the bank ’s influence on Platts prices , the benchmark for physical OTC trade across world oil markets .
‘ MASSIVE FOCUS ’
The move by Platts , a unit of McGraw - Hill Companies Inc , comes at a time of escalating concerns over counterparty risk across commodity markets as the credit crisis claims once - mighty financial institutions .
Unlike the futures markets , in which all trades are backed by a clearing house , cash and over - the - counter energy trade is usually bilateral .
“ Clearly there ’s massive focus on counterparty credit risk , ” a director at a bank in New York said .
“ We have not had any issue with clients pulling away , but a lot of people are clearing deals as opposed to doing bilateral deals . ”
Trading activity was also affected in other energy markets because of credit concerns .
Liquidity in two benchmark European coal swaps markets fell by up to 75 percent on Wednesday and Thursday as credit lines to swaps traders at banks were reduced , traders said .
Coal swaps traders , which include utilities , banks , physical coal traders and hedge funds , are moving to trade the IntercontinentalExchange ’s cleared swaps as they are seen as less risky , they said .
IN TALKS
Morgan Stanley was in deal talks with U.S. regional banking powerhouse Wachovia Corp , and negotiations advanced to a more formal stage , a source familiar with Morgan ’s plan said on Thursday .
“ There are many counterparties who have issues with Morgan Stanley now , ” said one of the sources familiar with the review , who declined to be named because the information is n’t public .
A second industry source said Morgan Stanley had been informed of the review this week .
Traders at five companies in Asia and Europe said their companies were taking a more cautious view of exposure to the bank .
One trade source with a Western company said he had been told to use ClearPort , a clearing platform backed by the CME ’s New York Mercantile Exchange ( NYMEX ) that allows traders to eliminate counterparty risk , for all trades involving Morgan Stanley .
BIG PLAYERS
A shake - up at Morgan Stanley would have wider reverberations for the world oil market than anything up to this point .
Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers were lesser players in the oil market .
Merrill Lynch , bought by Bank of America , may continue its operations in U.S. and European oil , gas and power trade .
Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs have dominated energy derivatives trade for many years and Morgan Stanley plays a big role in moving physical oil supplies around the world .
It is one of the biggest importers of jet fuel and gas oil into the United States and runs a physical distillate book .
It is not uncommon for Platts to put a company under “ review ” for anything from violating the rules of trade to delivering off - specification product after a trade , essentially a punitive measure known in the industry as “ boxing ” .
But it is less common for Platts to do so because of credit concerns , since these are more difficult to assess .
Platts placed Lehman Brothers , which has a much smaller energy trading operation , under review in early July , about two months before the bank collapsed .
Platts competes with Thomson Reuters in providing news and information to the energy markets .

The McCain campaign is outraged because today in Missouri Democratic vice presidential candidate Joe Biden asked if Sarah Palin cares about disabled kids so much , why does she oppose embryonic stem cell research .
According to Ben Smith while campaigning in Missouri Biden said , “ I hear all this talk about how the Republicans are going to work in dealing with parents who have both the joy , because there ’s joy to it as well , the joy and the difficulty of raising a child who has a developmental disability , who were born with a birth defect .
Well guess what folks ?
If you care about it , why do n’t you support stem cell research ? ”
I think it is a valid question , but McCain campaign disagrees .
Ben Porritt , spokesman for the McCain campaign said , “ Barack Obama ’s running mate sunk to a new low today launching an offensive debate over who cares more about special needs children .
Playing politics with this issue is disturbing and indicative of a desperate campaign . ”

Notice the tactic here , anytime an issue is brought up , it is dirty pool .
Biden did not mention Palin ’s child , but somehow we are not to discuss the issue of stem cell research and her position on it .
She , like most neo-cons , opposes embryonic stem cell research for strictly religious reasons .
The question is even more compelling when one considers that she has a disabled child , and she is not in favor of a treatment option that could help her own child .
In the end the issue of embryonic stem cell research in this country has little to do with science and everything to do with religion .
I think Palin needs to answer these kinds of questions .
If her opposition is based on religious belief then say so .
The reality is that if this is the reason why she opposes , the social conservative base of the Republican Party will support her even more .
However this is n’t what the campaign is worried about .
They are worried that once Palin ’s right wing views are exposed to non-Republicans , she is going to lose whatever extra support that her selection brought to the campaign .
Palin is n’t the candidate that the McCain camp is selling her as , and eventually , this is going to catch up with them .
I find it funny that they are trying to sell the Obama campaign as desperate , when every move the McCain camp has made has looked desperate .
I guess Obama is desperate due to that big McCain convention bounce .
Wait , there was no bounce .
They can try to hide Palin all they want , but eventually , she is going to have to face the music .
NEW YORK ( Fortune ) --
Here 's what 's wrong with most of what we 're hearing and reading on the financial crisis :
It forgets that people are n't potted plants .
Whether they 're Wall Street executives , homeowners in a down market , entrepreneurs facing a credit squeeze , or politicians facing re-election , people do n't just sit there and allow events to beat them up .
Instead , they anticipate and they respond .
I do n't claim special powers to know what how today 's crisis will turn out - or what the consequences will be of the actions that attempt to solve that crisis .
But I know for sure that some of what we 're reading and hearing does n't reflect clear thinking .
Here are three particularly important instances :
The economy :
The most troubling element of what we 're reading and hearing is the constant references to the Great Depression .
The error is in forgetting that all real - world situations are dynamic .
The Depression itself was a dynamic sequence .
It would n't have happened if the Fed had n't insanely stood pat and allowed the money supply to contract , rather than the correct policy of expanding it .
And it would n't have happened if Congress had n't clamped down on trade through the Smoot - Hawley bill .
Those things are n't happening this time .
Instead , Congress is apparently on the road to unfreezing the credit markets .
More important , America is a nation of 300 million resourceful people who will find opportunities in the current situation that you and I cannot imagine .
After President Bush 's speech on Wednesday evening , Brian Williams on NBC called this " the worst financial disaster in more than a generation . "
No , it is not that .
A crisis , yes ; a disaster , no .
Of course , it could still become one .
But for now , calling it a disaster is a dramatic overreaction .
CEO pay : Congress seems determined to make CEOs of financial firms suffer , and who can blame it ?
If taxpayers are going to bail out the firms at the root of the crisis , then the political imperative is that the leaders of those firms must be seen to pay a price .
Fine .
Just remember that CEOs are n't potted plants .
The last time Congress tried to crack down on CEO pay was in 1993 , when it amended the tax code ( section 162 ( m ) , in case you care ) so that pay above $ 1 million was not tax deductible to the employer if it was n't performance - based .
No problem , said companies - we 'll just cap salary at $ 1 million and ladle on stock options , which by definition are performance - based , in staggering amounts .
There followed the greatest bull market in history , and because of all those options CEOs made far more money than they ever would have if 162 ( m ) had n't happened .
How will CEOs turn the new pay restrictions to their advantage ?
I do n't know .
But you just watch .
" The end of Wall Street " :
The premise is that seven months ago there were five major investment banks , and now there are none .
Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers failed ; Merrill Lynch ( MER , Fortune 500 ) got sold to a commercial bank , Bank of America ( BAC , Fortune 500 ) ; and Goldman Sachs ( GS , Fortune 500 ) and Morgan Stanley ( MS , Fortune 500 ) are converting to commercial bank holding companies .
Thus , no more investment banks and the end of Wall Street as we know it .
I do n't buy it .
Have the advantages of the independent investment bank model forever vanished ?
Of course not .
Will the attractions of that model - avoiding the regulations and capital requirements of commercial banks - again become apparent as the current crisis fades ?
Certainly .
Will entrepreneurs - mostly bankers fired from the former Big Five - rush to start new firms , adapting ingeniously to the new rules , as economic conditions eventually become amenable ?
Of course they will .
In the rush of recent events it 's hard to think about the world five years from now .
But that world will come , and when it does , we 'll look back and realize that what just happened was n't the end of Wall Street .
Rather it was the extinction of the dinosaurs .
New species are on the way .
I promise you they 're in gestation right now .
I certainly do n't know what 's going to happen .
But I know for sure that it 's going to be shaped by millions of players in an infinitely complex global economy .
And I know that they wield ingenuity and creativity on a scale that none of us individually can imagine .
You never know whether the result will be for the better , but our system seems to possess a self - correcting impulse .
Most important , as we try to divine what will happen next , let 's not forget that through the tumult , no one sits still .
Matthew Bumpus was initially diagnosed with Acute Myleogenous Leukemia ( AML ) in August 2006 .
The following is excerpts from a letter Matt has sent to some Congress & Senate
members in an attempt to get assistance .
Hearing Matt ’s story in his own words is very powerful .
“ My name is Matt Bumpus and I am 31 years old .
I live in Roseville , CA with my wife and two sons .
I had the honor of serving my country in the US Army for 8 years and 9 months .
I was a Staff Sergeant , Command Section Sergeant and Stryker Vehicle Commander ; and was in Charlie Company , 2nd Battalion , 3rd Infantry Regiment .
I served in Iraq for a year and was primarily in heavy combat zones in and around Ballad and Al Mosul .
When I returned , my wife and I decided to go home to California and start setting down roots near our extended family and continue growing our family .
In July of 2006 , I was home , had a job with a bright future , we were expecting our second child , we had just moved into a house , and life was good !
At that time I was receiving a 10 % disability for a wrist and shoulder injury .
I had included a claim for hearing loss suffered while enlisted , but it was denied and therefore not included in the disability .
On July 31st I was rushed by ambulance to the hospital with acute appendicitis .
The next thing I remember is hearing that I had been diagnosed with the life threatening disease ; Acute Myelogenous Leukemia ( AML ) .
I was told that there was “ ˜chromosome damage due to radiation exposure . ’
The following months of chemo , drugs , increased ringing in my ears , and various procedures , were at times unbearable .
This is an extremely aggressive form of leukemia so the treatment is aggressive as well .
But by the grace of God I went into
remission at the end of 2006 .
I returned to work and an almost normal life .
I was alive , in remission , and very thankful .
As I mentioned earlier , I returned from Iraq with a hearing loss .
While going through the first treatment for Leukemia , I also suffered increased hearing loss and a constant loud ringing in my ears .
It is so loud at times that it could be maddening .
I included this as part of the AML claim in October 2006 since it was linked to the treatment of the AML .
The VA rejected the loss of hearing as part of the claim because they said that they could n’t “ ˜see enough physical damage ’ but then sent me to a saleswoman for a hearing aid costing thousands of dollars .
She told me that not only would this help me hear , it would also help eliminate the ringing .
At this point I had been out of work for months , with a family to support , and my wife due to have our second son any day , how could I pay thousands of dollars for a hearing aid that the VA said I did n’t really need ?
Sadly , after almost 2 years of remission , I find myself battling a relapse of AcuteMyelogenous Leukemia ( AML ) .
It has been medically established that AML can be caused by chemical exposures as well as radiation .
Daily job responsibilities throughout my time in the Army included training and operation of combat vehicles like Bradleys and Strykers .
When I served in Iraq , I guarded some chemical spills / sites and was exposed to Depleted Uranium ( from weapons use ) .
In one specific incident , our company was called in to guard what seemed to be an old sealed bunker .
We were wearing our normal protective gear .
It was very dark inside but when we found “ ˜unknown ’ chemicals , a Nuclear Biological Chemical Specialist was called in for testing .
When he recognized one of the chemicals he quickly left the site and returned in full protective gear .
We immediately put on our masks and worked our way out of the building .
When the testing was done , a higher echelon of testers was brought in , while we continued to guard at the door of the bunker .
Based on the seriousness of the results , we were told to leave the bunker and stay approximately a mile away .
My disability claim for AML was made in October of 2006 when I was hospitalized for an emergency appendectomy .
I had been through chemo , bone marrow biopsies , a lengthy hospital stay , and was recovering
at home .
Unfortunately , the V.A. denied the connection or disability benefits for the illness .
In my “ ˜rejection letter ’ from the VA , it states that “ We denied your claim for pension benefits .
The evidence of record fails to demonstrate you are unable to secure or follow a substantial gainful occupation as a result of this disability . ” 
It also states “ Service connection for Acute Myeloid Leukemia is denied . ” 
( See enclosure # 1 )
And now the chemo , antibiotics , and AML have taken the majority of my hearing , and made the ringing worse .
I can now only hear most people when they shout , and some people I can not hear at all .
I can not hear doctors or nurses when they are discussing treatment or asking questions .
Someone else must be there to make sure I get all of the information or summarize later .
On a personal note , can you imagine not being able to hear your 18 month old son ask for a drink , or tell you he loves you ?
Would you protect your country if youknew you might not be able to hear your 11 year old son talk about his newest interest or ask a question about his faith ?
Currently I am waiting and praying for a lifesaving bone marrow match to be found .
I will continue to have chemotherapy once a month until then and will not be released to go back to work for at least one year , and that is if a bone marrow match can be found .
Another point to make is that if / when a match is found it costs $ 1,000 dollars per potential match to complete the final screening .
Currently insurance does n’t cover it and I am on a partial income while not working .
And there are others returning with this type of Leukemia as a well as other cancers .
One such person was Andy Rounds .
He joined the Army right out of high school .
Andy served with Army 1/62 ( Tropic Lightening out of Hawaii , Schofield Barracks ) and he was stationed in Kirkuk , Iraq at a forward operating base .
Two years after his release from the Army , Andy was diagnosed with Acute Myelogenous Leukemia .
Andy died in October of 2007 at age 22 .
His mother could not even get his funeral paid for .
There is another man in Alabama , Joshua Barber , who served as a civilian Trainer to Iraqi police , jailers , and prison guards at the same location ( Mosul ) and he has recently been diagnosed with the same form of Leukemia .
And finally , one of the keys to the VA not taking responsibility for this is that it was not diagnosed within 12 months of separation of service .
Research shows this disease , like other cancers , can take years to manifest .
An irony here is that there is a “ ˜ Gulf War exam ’ that is offered to any service member returning from the Middle East I was not informed of it until after I was diagnosed .
In closing , I was willing to give my life for this country .
I went to Iraq with the pride and conviction that I was protecting my America , my beliefs , and my family .
Now I am asking for the same support .
I believe that I amentitled to a full disability .
I believe that the VA should take the obvious responsibility and do everything in its power to save my life and the lives of others , and prevent this from happening in the future .
Returning veterans
must be informed about the Gulf War Exam that they are entitled to .
I risked my life to defend my country and I would like to think that in return , this United States government would accept its responsibility and do the right thing .
I appreciate your time and attention to this matter and I would like to thank you in advance for anything you might do to help .
Sincerely ,
Matthew Bumpus
Editor ’s Note : Matt died on the morning of August 3rd , 2008 , after a valiant battle , surrounded by family and friends .
We are encourage everyone to register with the Bone Marrow Registry ( all it requires is a simple swab to the cheek and a little paperwork ) and to please tell everyone you know about the importance of the Gulf War Exam .

Lindsey Williams says it is .
He was crystal clear over a year ago that gasoline was headed straight to $ 4.00 a gallon and he says he knows why .
Williams became an oil industry insider by virtue of his success at mediating labor disputes in the Alaska oil fields .
Little did his colleagues know , he had no intention to become a " good old boy . "
McCain ad blames Obama for rising gas prices RAW STORY
Published : Monday July 21 , 2008
Print This Email
This " Do n't hope for new energy , vote for it , " a new ad for the McCain campaign advises Americans , which blames Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama for the rising cost of gas prices .
According to CBS , " The campaign says the spot will air on cable and in Colorado , Indiana , Michigan , Missouri , Nevada , New Hampshire , New Mexico , Ohio , Pennsylvania , ( northern ) Virginia , and Wisconsin . "
In the ad , a female narrator almost whispers , " Gas prices - $ 4 , $ 5 , no end in sight , because some in Washington are still saying no to drilling in America , " as the camera focuses on a solitary gas pump , and the murmurs of a chanting crowd can be heard in the background .
" No to independence from foreign oil . "
A closeup of numbers skyrocketing up on the gas pump is then inserted .
" Who can you thank for rising prices at the pump ? " the narrator asks as a picture of a smiling Obama materializes next to the pump and in front of the numbers which are still rocketing out of control .
The crowd has been chanting Obama 's name , the ad reveals .
The video then disrupts and turns to black , before turning to shots of McCain : " One man knows we must now drill more in America and rescue our family budgets . "
The Washington Post 's Howard Kurtz calls the ad a " stretch , " but adds that it " might have some appeal . "
" John McCain may try in this ad to blame rising gas prices on Barack Obama , but after seven and a half years of the Bush administration , that 's a stretch , " Kurtz writes for the paper 's The Trail blog .
" McCain himself said last week that America 's ' dangerous dependence on foreign oil has been 30 years in the making ' ; Obama has been in Washington for four . "
Kurtz adds , " It 's a bit audacious for McCain to charge that ' some in Washington ' still oppose offshore oil drilling , since that was his position , most notably in his 2000 presidential campaign , until he reversed himself last month and called for a lifting of the 27 - year federal ban on such drilling . "
" Nor is there any evidence that Obama opposes ' independence from foreign oil , ' although his energy plan is very different , " Kurtz continues .
" The Illinois senator has called McCain 's plan for a temporary gas - tax holiday a gimmick . "
Finally , Kurtz concludes , " Drilling off the coasts would increase U.S. oil production but have no short - term impact on gas prices .
While some analysts disagree , an Energy Department report last year said production would not start until 2017 and have no ' significant ' effect on prices or supplies until 2030 . "
The following ad was placed on YouTube by the McCain campaign :
After more than three years away from professional cycling , Lance Armstrong  the cancer survivor and seven - time Tour de France winner  announced Tuesday that he would emerge from retirement and climb back onto his bike .
Armstrong , who will turn 37 next week , spoke briefly about his decision in a videotaped statement posted on his foundation ’s Web site .
“ Hey everybody , I know there ’s been a lot of reports in the media today about a possible return to racing , ” he said , wearing a white T - shirt and leaning toward what seemed to be a handheld camera .
“ Just want to let you know that after long talks with my kids , the rest of my family , a close group of friends , I have decided to return to professional cycling in 2009 . ”
Armstrong provided few details , but he said he was making the comeback to begin an international cancer strategy .
He did not return telephone messages , but in an e-mail statement he said his return would “ raise awareness of the global cancer burden . ”
ROME ( Reuters ) -
An Italian woman who worked as a part - time judge as well as a lawyer was substituted by her identical twin sister in court so she would not lose out on legal fees when she had two simultaneous engagements .
The 54 - year - old twins from northern Italy have now been charged with fraud and will go on trial in January , Italy ’s leading newspaper , Corriere della Sera , reported Friday on its website .
One of the twins , identified only as Gabriella , worked primarily as a lawyer but also as an honorary judge , a part - time , paid position that entails helping full - time judges when their case load is heavy .
When Gabriella was called to be a substitute judge she sent her sister twin Patrizia to stand in for her at an existing engagement as a defense lawyer elsewhere in the Milan area .
The problem was that sister Patrizia was not a lawyer like sister Gabriella but charged the clients anyway .
The clients discovered the sister act and are now suing both for damages .
Prosecutors have charged both with fraud , the paper said .
Posturing macho warrior cops in Chicago , Miami , Palm Beach County , Montana , and Johnson City , Tennessee are all now starting to carry AR - 15 or M4 assault rifles with them on ordinary street patrols , for all those tactical situations that they expect to find themselves in .
Throughout the 1990s , Washington , D.C. had more of its residents killed by police officers than any other city in the United States .
Now the D.C. metropolitan police department has ordered 500 AR - 15 assault rifles , which they will begin issuing to inner-city patrol cops to start carrying on the streets this summer .
I guess so they can more effectively shoot 14 year old black bike - thieving suspects in the back of the head .
Do you feel safer now ?

AIG , the quintessential blue - chip , one of the 30 companies that
compose the Dow Jones Industrial Average , a company that in 2000
boasted a market capitalization of $ 217 billion , making it the largest
financial institution in the world , is teetering on the brink of
collapse .
Worth just $ 7 billion today , the future of what was until
recently the world ’s largest insurance company is hanging by a
thread — that thread being the willingness of Wall Street institutions
like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley , themselves facing credit issues ,
to come up with $ 75 billion in rescue loans .
It used to be that investors who were worried about financial
markets , or who did n’t like to take big risks , would put their money in
what were called “ blue chips ” — companies that were deemed conservative ,
safe investments that could weather any storm .
They had names like
AT&T , General Motors , Ford , Boeing … and AIG .
Well , AT&T is a shadow of its former self , GM and Ford are both
being talked of as dead men walking by analysts , Boeing is on
life - support , or , since it is being propped up by its military
contracts , more appropriately death support , and AIG , well , it ’s
already got one foot in the grave .
There really are no blue chips any more .
The largest companies in
the world , as Enron showed , can vanish overnight in a puff of smoke .
Look at Lehman Brothers .
Here today , then , poof , gone tomorrow .
In AIG ’s case , if the insurance giant goes under , it may take a lot with it .
An article today in the Australian daily The Australian ( Rupert Murdoch ’s NewsCorp flagship and hardly a Marxian rag ) put it this way :
Should the US Treasury and Federal Reserve fail in last - ditch
efforts to secure breathing space for AIG , then sub - prime 's cascading
woes will have slowly smashed financial markets into worse shape than
the legendary market meltdown of 1987 .
And , from there , governments and banking regulators alike will have
to ponder the previously unthinkable : are we on the way to a place
comparable with 1929 ?
So what are anxious investors to do ?
Clearly there are no safe
harbors in the stock market , which could as easily drop 40 percent or
70 percent tomorrow as rise 3 percent .
Bonds do n’t look much better .
They may be more stable than equities , but not if the company that
issues them goes bust .
Then they are worthless scraps of paper , no
better than the share certificates for Fannie Mae that are now being
used to line cat litter boxes .
The ratings agencies , like
Standard &Poors , Fitch and Moody ’s , while exercising their usual
timidity about downgrading a major corporate entity , have belatedly
knocked AIG ’s credit rating down two notches today , which is their way
of hinting that if you are an AIG bondholder , you have a significantly
greater chance of losing your shirt .
Nor is it just investors who have to fear .
Individuals who have
tried to protect their families by purchasing life insurance policies ,
or who have sought to establish a secure retirement income by buying
annuities from AIG , need to worry about whether the company will be
around to make the payments when they or their beneficiaries need them .
Sure , the states , which are responsible in the US for regulating the
insurance industries , for the most part have established reserve funds
to backstop insurance carriers , but like the FDIC which insures bank
deposits up to only $ 100,000 , these funds generally only back the first
$ 100,000 of insurance or annuity coverage as a “ cash surrender ” value ,
or $ 300,000 as a benefit payout .
But those state guaranty funds were
designed to protect people from failures of fly - by - night insurance
operations .
They are woefully underfunded for companies on the scale of
AIG .
AIG is such a giant in the insurance business that as one corporate treasurer told The Australian :
“ If AIG collapses , then the world does n’t have insurance . ”
The New York Times , commenting on fears among ordinary people that their insurance or their annuities may not be there when needed , quoted one insurance adviser ,
Glenn Daily , who said a client who was an AIG policy holder was
borrowing the maximum against his life policy , planning to park that
money somewhere to see if the AIG crisis blows over .
But he added
darkly , “ If everyone does this , the company could be driven out of
business . ”
Actually , it ’s worse than that .
As Michael Lewitt , a Florida - based money manager , wrote today in an opinion article in today ’s New York Times ,
AIG is a key player in the $ 60 trillion ( yes that ’s trillion with a
“ T ” ! ) credit swap default market , a huge , international and wholly
unregulated field in which hedge funds play , and whose collapse would
make the 1929 Great Crash look like a minor fender - bender .
So that ’s what it ’s coming down to .
There are no Blue Chip refuges
from the rolling disaster that is the US economy today .
And there are
no easy rescues — indeed according to one theory Treasury Secretary Henry
Paulson let Lehman Brothers go bust because he knew he needed what
funds the Treasury has left to try to keep AIG alive .
It ’s all a
fragile , interconnected house of cards , propped up by a residual faith
among ordinary investors who , at least so far , still think it has some
kind of inherent structure to it .
As card after card gets pulled out of
that rickety stack — first Bear Stearns , then IndyMac Bank , then Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , then Lehman Brothers , now perhaps AIG and
Washington Mutual , a large savings institution that is on a death
watch — at some point those investors and now insurance clients , too , may
all decide to take their money and go home , and the whole thing will
come crashing down .

A giant inflatable dog turd created by the American artist Paul McCarthy was blown from its moorings at a Swiss museum , bringing down a power line and breaking a window before landing in the grounds of a children 's home .
The exhibit , entitled Complex Shit , is the size of a house .
It has a safety system that is supposed to deflate it in bad weather , but it did not work on this occasion .
Juri Steiner , the director of the Paul Klee centre , in Berne , told AFP that a sudden gust of wind carried it 200 metres before it fell to the ground , breaking a window of the children 's home .
The accident happened on July 31 , but the details only emerged yesterday .
Steiner said McCarthy had not yet been contacted and the museum was not sure if the piece ( pictured here ) would be put back on display .
The installation is part of an exhibition called East of Eden : A Garden Show , which features sound sculptures in trees and a football ground without goalposts .
The exhibition opened in May and is due to run until October .
The centre 's website describes the show as containing " interweaving , diverse , not to say conflictive emphases and a broad spectrum of items to form a dynamic exchange of parallel and self - eclipsing spatial and temporal zones " .
( This post is a work in progress , as things still evolve )
In a way , I am glad I have made a fork , and I am glad this is going to be the shortest fork ever .
A lot of people reacted on my proposal and I could get a very clear picture of what is wrong in the distutils / setuptools world , and how I could help on this .
This is how I interpret it :
Guido explained that the mistake made was not to integrate setuptools in the core from the very begining .
The current distutils code did not evolve in the meantime and Phillip Eby worked on setuptools to make it evolve .
setuptools now reaches a point where it needs other contributors to fit all the needs and solve more problems .
It had one contributor in the past , ( Jim Fulton ) but it needs more .
It also became a mandatory package for many folks in the Python world because Phillip did a great work on it : it solves most problems .
From what I could see , all the people that gets frustrated at some point with setuptools , either do n’t use it , either try to see how it could be changed .
But when they try that , they take the same paths others have taken before because there is a lack of info and documentation on setuptools current status and future .
And these paths are quite long for the brain before you are able to provide a well - thaught idea or patch .
I have tried to help myself on setuptools , then I have started to blame Phillip saying that he did not have enough time to make setuptools evolve .
But that was the wrong approach , because the only problem really , is a lack of visibility in setuptools development .
And this is something that can be fixed quite easily I believe .
The bug tracker added some months ago helped a lot .
A roadmap and one or two page around it and that should be it .
Guido also stated that it was merely impossible to work on the next generation of distutils outside Python core .
But in the meantime this means that we need some people from the core to help us in there .
And they are really busy ( I can understand that ) on other matters in Python code .
We can write patches for some fixes for sure , and there are hundreds of them to do in distutils .
But to boost it we would need a core developer that gives some love to that package .
I mean , for example I still have a patch waiting for reviewing , wich only adds some unit tests that are lacking .
There is no code there , just unit tests , and it is pending since 6 months …
Guido said that I could try to become a core developer , that this was not impossible , if I started to contribute patches often to other parts of Python as well .
But that ’s quite a challenge .
What frustrated me is that some people like Jim Fulton said they were willing to work on a new distutils from scratch , and in the meantime I understand what Guido says .
he pointed us to Joel entry on rewriting from scratch .
My Plans
I do n’t have the brain to drive a fork of setuptools at this time .
I knew it from the beginning , I just wanted to make people react .
I think that setuptools can be the laboratory where we can experiment things , and distutils the place where we can apply them at some point , with Phillip help because he has a pretty big overview of all that .
It is going to take years , but well , we are young .
To help on this I will :
try to gather people at the PloneConf to talk about it , maybe even sprint

Parents will go a long way to protect their children , and one type of wasp goes as far as offering a home to a parasitic mite that helps fight off intruders at its nest .
After breeding , potter wasps ( Allodynerus delphinalis ) build a nest and lay eggs inside cavities that contain food and are sealed with mud and saliva .
But the insect 's offspring are threatened by parasitic wasps that try to invade the nest and lay their eggs inside the cavities .
This kills the baby potter wasp in the process .
! ADVERTISEMENT !
Ensliniella parasitica , is a parasitic mite known to feed on the potter wasp 's haemolymph , a vital circulatory fluid that is rich in nutrients .
Inside a nest , some mites move to the cavities , feeding on the food stores and the baby wasp without damaging the developing offspring .
But the mite was thought to offer nothing to the potter wasps in return .
Now , Kimiko Okabe and Shun'ichi Makino from the Forestry and Forest Products Research Institute in Tsukuba , Japan , have found that the mites actually serve as tiny bodyguards , attacking parasitic wasps that venture into a host 's nest .
It was a surprising discovery since the mites normally show no aggressive behaviour .
" None of astigmatid mites , which include this species , were previously known to attack other species , particularly ones larger than themselves , " Okabe says .

The diary states they had tea after the game and also played cricket Local historians in Surrey have confirmed evidence that baseball was played in the UK more than 20 years before American independence .
A diary that documents a game being played in Guildford in 1755 has been verified by Surrey History Centre .
William Bray , a Surrey diarist and historian from Shere , wrote about the game when he was still a teenager .
Major League Baseball , the governing body of the game in the US , has been informed of the discovery .
Mixed sport Julian Pooley , Surrey History Centre manager and William Bray expert , said the diary showed the game was a well - established sport in the 18th Century and was played by men and women .
Tricia St John Barry , who owns the diary , dug out the documents last year after watching a report on BBC South Today which said the sport began in the 1790s .
Ms St John
Barry remembered the old manuscript , which she had had for many years , and responded to an appeal to viewers for more information on the subject .
William Bray lived from 1736 to 1832 and worked as a solicitor , a steward of Surrey manors and a Surrey historian .

More from Today programme Mr Pooley said : " He kept lots and lots of diaries that we have in the Surrey History Centre but last year a new one was discovered in a garden shed and it contains his diary from 1754 to 1755 .
" It contains a reference to him playing baseball .
What intrigued me is he is playing it with a load of young ladies . "
The diary states they had tea after the game on Easter Monday and also played cricket .
Kevin Sullivan , the Washington Post 's London bureau correspondent and an avid Boston Red Sox fan , told BBC Radio Four 's Today Programme : " It 's a great American tradition to take things from other places and improve them .
" We 've always known that baseball evolved - it was n't invented like basketball . "
There was a later historical reference to the game being played in England in Jane Austen 's Northanger Abbey , written between 1797 and 1798 .

Shrinking access to EU documents ?
This is from a press release on the European Ombudsman site :
“ The European Ombudsman , P. Nikiforos Diamandouros , has called on the European Parliament ( EP ) to defend the European Union ’s commitment to transparency and the citizens ’ right of access to EU documents .
This follows the European Commission ’s recent proposals to revise the law on public access to documents .
In his contribution to today ’s public hearing in the EP ’s LIBE Committee ( Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs ) , the Ombudsman said :
“ The Commission ’s proposals would mean access to fewer , not more , documents .
This raises fundamental issues of principle about the EU ’s commitment to openness and transparency . ”
Read the entire contribution given by the Ombudsman
The EU proposals sharply limit the definition of what is a “ document ” —
” The Commission ’s proposed definition of a document would mean that , in many cases , citizens could only apply for access to a document if it appeared in a register . ”

WASHINGTON , Sept. 5 ( UPI ) --
The first weeks of middle school are a frenzy , but are also a good time for parents to discuss alcohol dangers with children , a U.S. non-profit group said .
The Science Inside Alcohol Project of the American Association for the Advancement of Science says nearly 20 percent of 14 - year - old teens say they 've been drunk at least once .
In addition :

-- The Partnership for a Drug - Free America released a study in August , 2008 of 6,500 teens in which 73 percent said school stress caused them to drink and take drugs .
-- A Columbia University study found that " problem parents , " who let their kids stay out past 10 p.m. on school nights , are putting the kids in situations in which they are at risk for substance use .
-- About 100 university leaders called for a national discussion of lowering the drinking age to 18 .
The middle - school years are crucial in the battle to prevent early alcohol use , the report said .
Students start pulling away from parents , yet seek out other adults for guidance , Shirley Malcom of the American Association for the Advancement of Science said .
It 's the most vulnerable time , specialists say , but also one of the last times they still can be influenced by adults .

Rush Limbaugh is quoted in a new Spanish - language Obama ad that ties John McCain to the nativist fringe of the Republican Party .
The ad itself is n’t exactly fair — McCain has showed a willingness to kowtow to that nativist fringe , but he ’s still probably the GOP ’s leading advocate for a humane approach to immigration reform .
But Limbaugh does n’t believe in that humane approach , and in a Wall Street Journal op - ed published today , he is n’t standing up for John McCain ’s record on immigration issues .
Instead , he ’s arguing that he is n’t as big a jerk as the quotes in the Obama ad make him look .
Limbaugh notes the quotes and then provides the full paragraphs from which they came , with the mistaken belief that somehow the context proves he is n’t a bigot .
In fact , the context just reinforces the original point .
See for yourself .
Supposedly out - of - context quote :
“ … stupid and unskilled Mexicans . ”
Supposedly exculpatory context :
“ If you are unskilled and uneducated , your job is going south .
Skilled workers , educated people are going to do fine ’ cause those are the kinds of jobs Nafta is going to create .
If we are going to start rewarding no skills and stupid people , I ’m serious , let the unskilled jobs that take absolutely no knowledge whatsoever to do — let stupid and unskilled Mexicans do that work . ”
Second supposedly out - of - context quote :
“ You shut your mouth or you get out ! ”
Supposedly exculpatory context :
“ And another thing :
You do n’t have the right to protest .
You ’re allowed no demonstrations , no foreign flag waving , no political organizing , no bad - mouthing our president or his policies .
You ’re a foreigner : shut your mouth or get out !
And if you come here illegally , you ’re going to jail . ”
Turns out , the full paragraphs are just as xenophobic and hateful as the isolated quotes .
Why ?
Because Rush Limbaugh is xenophobic and hateful .
Funny how that works .

The AZ ban :
It 's not so EZ
by Jeremy Hooper
On the topic of the state 's proposed marriage ban , The Arizona Republic has run a piece simply rife with annoying comments .
Here are some excerpts along with our thoughts :
" We are not against anything , " said Barbara Willis , president of Crisis Pregnancy Centers , a ministry organization that has poured $ 100,000 into the campaign supporting Proposition 102 .
" We support marriage as one man and one woman . "
Yes , Ms. Willis , you are against us .
No , no , do n't argue -- you are .
Ya see because when it comes to the damage that these marriage amendments have on gay couples , you , as a supporter of the ban , do not have the right or even ability to speak to the ban 's ill effects .
And denying that your actions are are discriminatory will do nothing to change the fact that this and every ban will be remembered for all of recorded history as biased , unjust , cruel , mean - spirited , and thoroughly un-American .
This time , the measure is not weighted down with multiple clauses and provisions .
Proposition 102 is 20 words long .
" Because it 's so clear , it 's very easy for people to get their arms around it , " said Kelly Molique , a married Scottsdale mother of two who has volunteered to talk in support of the amendment .
" It keeps it real simple . "
Yes , Ms. Molique , it is " simple . "
The problem with that ?
Life is complex .
Humanity exists along a vast spectrum , not an unaccommodating sliver .
And this and every " simple " ban cruelly overlooks a rich , vibrant portion of the population .
While you might see this particular ban as easy for folks to get their arms around , have you even stopped to consider that there are hundreds of thousands of your fellow residents who are made uneasy by the proposed amendment ?
These residents are sick and tired of being legally estranged to the person they love to put their arms around !
For them , the only thing that is simpler than the wording of the myopic ban is their ability to realize just how inappropriate it is !
" A supreme court of Arizona could , in five years , have a different view of things , " said attorney Tim Casey , who is working in favor of Proposition 102 .
" You just never know what 's going to happen . "
That 's why a constitutional amendment is needed , on top of the law , he said .
A law can be declared unconstitutional , but the constitution can't be found unconstitutional .
Yes , Ms. Willis , you are against us .
No , no , do n't argue -- you are .
Ya see because when it comes to the damage that these marriage amendments have on gay couples , you , as a supporter of the ban , do not have the right or even ability to speak to the ban 's ill effects .
And denying that your actions are are discriminatory will do nothing to change the fact that this and every ban will be remembered for all of recorded history as biased , unjust , cruel , mean - spirited , and thoroughly un-American .
Yes , Ms. Molique , it is " simple . "

These residents are sick and tired of being legally estranged to the person they love to put their arms around !
For them , the only thing that is simpler than the wording of the myopic ban is their ability to realize just how inappropriate it is !
Well first off -- yes , amendments can absolutely be remedied .
It 's admittedly more difficult to obtain a correction or repeal ( via U.S Supreme Court , another referendum , etc. ) , but it 's not even close to impossible .
In fact , we would be willing to bet ( hope ? ) that we 're only a decade or so shy of EVERY state anti-gay amendment being deemed inappropriate .
Why ?
Because they go against everything that a fair constitution is and should be !
And the American public , with every eighteen birthday , is becoming a more gay - friendly mass of people .
The misjudgment that led to the approval and passage of these nasty amendments says nothing about their value or propriety ( or , really , constitutionality ) , and none of their supporters should find comfort in the ability they had in obtaining majority approval .
The last laugh may be preceded by years of tears , but it will ultimately belong to the gay community .
That 's a promise .
Also , you on the anti-gay side really need to rethink your views on the judicial system .
If there is a possibility that a court might lay down the path towards marriage equality , do you ever stop and think that maybe there is a reason for that ?
Like , say , oh , I do n't know : BECAUSE TAX - PAYING GAY AND LESBIAN CITIZENS DESERVE EQUAL PROTECTION UNDER THE LAW !
The potential for marriage equality does n't speak to the need for a ban -- it speaks to the need for social conservatives to rethink their limited worldviews !
Supporters such as Molique and Frank Macias , chairman of Yes for Marriage , say they do n't see much change in Arizona if Proposition 102 passes .
But if it fails , Macias says , anything is possible .
" Who knows what the danger could be ? " he said .
Macias , who has been married for more than 30 years , said the Yes campaign is not anti-gay but , rather , in favor of one of the fundamental building blocks of society .
" We 're certainly not against the homosexual , the gay people , " he said .
" If they want to establish their own relationships , that 's OK . "
Ugh , again with the " we 're not against gays " promise .
But since we 've addressed it above , we 're not going to rehash .
Instead , let 's talk about the idea that nothing will change under the amendment , but everything could change without it .
That is a totally self - absorbed notion that , like most every comment featured here , totally overlooks the portion of the population that realistically , tangibly exists in an LGBT state .
And the idea that quality for this sect is nothing more than a slippery slope is fear - mongering at its Bush era worst .
Finally and arguably most importantly :
We do n't need a social conservative 's permission to establish our own relationships , Mr. Macias .
We are not dogs waiting for whatever bones you feel like throwing us .
We are human - fricking - beings !
What we are seeking is to be treated as what we are : EQUALS .
Nothing more , nothing less .
Human beings who do n't have to jump through any hoop or step into any alternate line in order to establish our relationships .
Humans who can , 30 years from now , also have our three decades - old marriages mentioned in a local newspaper article .
Except of course our article will not feature us trying to deny our fellow citizens the peaceful goals that they seek .
We would never be so brazen .
Marriage definition returns to Ariz. ballot [ AZ Republic ]
Your thoughts
The Constitutional amendment known as Proposition 2 was passed in Colorado , but later declared unconstitutional by the Colorado Supreme court in Even v Romer , and this was later upheld by the US Supreme Court in Romer v Even ..
This prop basically prohibited government entities like Aspen from enacting laws prohibiting discrimination against gays .
The court reasoned that prop 2 kept one minority group from proposing legislation in their interest which did n't apply to any other group .
So Constitutional amendments can be declared unconstitutional if they conflict with other , more fundamental constitutional provisions .

Whole Foods , following in the footsteps of Taco Bell , Burger King , and McDonalds , agreed this week to become the first grocery chain to improve working conditions and pay for the Coalition of Immokalee Workers ( CIW ) , tomato workers from Florida .
Whole Foods will pay an extra penny per pound of tomatoes , and will work in conjunction with the CIW to establish modern working standards for its agricultural workers .
That penny more per pound might not seem like much , but tomato pickers earn about 45 cents for every 32 - lb bucket of tomatoes they pick , working almost all daylight hours with no overtime pay .
The 45 - cent rate has n’t changed in nearly 30 years .
As a result , farmworker wages fall beneath the federal poverty level .
The CIW has been working for farm workers for years , but approached Whole Foods over a year ago to gain their support .
“ We commend the CIW for their advocacy on behalf of these workers , ” said Karen Christensen , Global Produce Coordinator for Whole Foods Market .
“ After carefully evaluating the situation in Florida , we felt that an agreement of this nature was in line with our core values and was in the best interest of the workers . ”
The CIW is a community - based farmworkers advocacy group with over 4,000 members .
Their Campaign for Fair Food has won unprecedented support for farm labor reforms from retail food industry leaders , with the goal of utilizing the power of those companies to demand more humane labor standards from their Florida tomato suppliers .
“ With this agreement , the Campaign for Fair Food has again broken new ground , ” said Gerardo Reyes of the CIW .
“ This is not only our first agreement in the supermarket industry but , in working with Whole Foods Market , we have the opportunity to really raise the bar to establish and ensure modern day labor standards and conditions in Florida . ”
Whole Foods will also help the CIW establish a domestic purchasing program that mirrors its Whole Trade Guarantee , ensuring transparancy in purchasing and fair and equitable prices and safe , healthy working conditions for producers and laborers .

Even before his indictment , the senator was behind in polls against the leading Democratic challenger , Mayor Mark Begich of Anchorage .
And before he gets to the general election , he must win the Republican primary on Aug. 26 .
He is favored in the primary , but Alaska political experts say his indictment has made that race less certain .

In Washington , Mr. Sullivan , the senator ’s lawyer , asked the judge to have the trial moved to Alaska , arguing that 90 percent of the witnesses in the case live there .
Prosecutors said they would oppose a change of venue .
Prosecutors said they would need about three weeks to present their case , although Mr. Sullivan said he believed it could take less time .
“ This is not a complex case , ” he said .
Some legal experts interpreted Mr. Stevens ’s request for a speedy trial as a show of confidence .
The indictment says he deliberately did not include gifts of home renovations , furniture , a sport utility vehicle and other items on the annual financial disclosure forms he is required to file as a senator .
He has said he paid all the bills he received for the renovations .
“ It ’s going to be a contest over whether he had the intent to conceal this , ” said Stanley Brand , a prominent Washington defense lawyer .
“ Given that he paid for some of it , I do n’t think that ’s in dispute .
He has a defense to put forth to a jury , and to some extent , that ’s going to undercut the government ’s contention that he intended to conceal all this . ”
Unlike with a bribery charge , Mr. Brand said , the government is not expected to try to prove that Mr. Stevens had corrupt relationships with VECO executives and employees .
“ No one is going to convict him for just failing to file his financial reports , ” Mr. Brand said .
Mr. Stevens was not required to post bond , but the judge agreed with the prosecutors ’ request that he surrender his passport .
BLAINE , Minnesota ( Reuters ) -
As the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression hit Wall Street and dominated the U.S. presidential campaign this week , White House hopeful John McCain looked for a fall guy .
He found one in Christopher Cox , a friend and fellow Republican who chairs the Securities and Exchange Commission .
“ I would fire him , ” McCain declared on Thursday .
Problem solved ?
Not exactly .
After a week that started with McCain blundering by talking about the ailing economy ’s strong fundamentals , the Republican presidential candidate sought a target to blame for Wall Street ’s woes and outlined a plan he said would fix the system that caused the meltdown .
That does not mean his strategy was well received .
“ He chose the wrong scapegoat , ” said James Cox , a professor of corporate and securities law at Duke University who is not related to the SEC chairman .
“ It shows a profound ignorance of something ( McCain ) ought to know about being in Washington , and that is the limited regulatory authority of the SEC . ”
McCain ’s advisers acknowledged that many agencies shared the blame for the market turmoil but said the Arizona senator had targeted the SEC because of its failed regulatory role .

“ The SEC did not do its job , ” said Steve Schmidt , the senior adviser who runs the McCain campaign ’s day - to - day operations .
“ Chairman Cox , who Sen. McCain counts as a friend ... was at the helm of the ship .
There was not effective oversight .
They ’re the regulating agency and there must be accountability put back into our system of politics . ”
Market participants , already reeling from the week ’s events , were not impressed .
“ I ’m disappointed ... that both sides , whether its Republicans or Democrats , are n’t saying ‘ let ’s try to fix this ’ first before we try to assess blame , ” said Andrew Busch , global foreign exchange strategist at BMO Capital Markets in Chicago .
“ It ’s very frustrating for the financial market to hear this and then be subject to the volatility that ensues afterwards .
I wish both candidates would understand that . ”
DISTANCE FROM BUSH
The Wall Street Journal , known for its conservative editorial board , said McCain had shown he did not understand the financial crisis .
“ This assault on Mr. Cox is both false and deeply unfair .
It ’s also unpresidential , ” it said in an editorial .
“ In a crisis , voters want steady , calm leadership , not misleading answers that will do nothing to help . ”
President George W. Bush , who appointed Cox , stood with the SEC chairman during a televised speech at the White House on Friday , a clear sign of support .
Cox , a former Republican congressman , has said he plans to step down when the Bush administration ends in January 2009 .
Whether he chose the right target or not , some Republicans said McCain ’s move distanced him from the unpopular president .
“ He ’s using this as a way to distinguish himself from the Bush administration , ” said John Feehery , a Republican strategist .
“ I do n’t think anyone knows who Chris Cox is really outside the beltway ( in Washington ) , but sometimes it ’s good to fire somebody . ”
Or at least promise to fire somebody .
After discovering a president cannot actually dismiss the SEC chief --- he can be relieved of his chairmanship , but not removed from the commission -- McCain changed his language .
In a speech in Wisconsin , he called for Cox to step down voluntarily .
McCain also lobbed criticism at the Federal Reserve , saying it should focus on strengthening the dollar and get out of the business of bailouts .
“ The economic crisis has been a real game changer and I think it stalled McCain ’s momentum , ” said strategist Todd Harris .
“ Now they ’re taking positive steps to get it back . ”
Daniel Smith , a political science professor at the University of Florida , said McCain enjoyed a political bounce after he chose Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin as his running mate , but now it was time to go back to his strengths .
“ He was granted a reprieve when Obama ’s campaign took the bait , took the Palin bait and was off message for a week , ” Smith said .
“ ( Now ) Obama has focused his attention squarely on the economy , his strong suit .
McCain needs to bring the attention back to international affairs . ”
BOSTON ( Reuters ) - A jolt from an implanted defibrillator is a very bad sign -- heart failure patients are about six times more likely to die after they receive their first life - saving shock , researchers reported on Wednesday .
And 30 percent of those deaths come within a day of the jolt , the researchers found .
They said their study , published in the New England Journal of Medicine , suggests that implantable defibrillators often merely delay the inevitable .
Dr. Jeanne Poole of the University of Washington in Seattle said , “ The most important thing to remember is that the defibrillators save lives , ” and the findings mean a defibrillator shock may be a danger signal that patients and doctors should heed .
“ The important message is that the first occurrence of shocks is not a random event in an otherwise stable clinical course but a sign of clinical deterioration in the underlying disease process , ” Drs. Jeff Healey and Stuart Connolly of McMaster University in Hamilton , Ontario , wrote in a commentary .
Dr. Mark Estes of Tufts University in Boston and the Heart Rhythm Society said defibrillators are less likely to deliver a jolt today than earlier models because newer devices try to use pacing impulses to restore an abnormal heart rhythm before resorting to shocks .
A shock “ is a sign that the patient ’s clinical status has changed , ” Estes said in a telephone interview .
“ They may be developing more heart failure .
There may be blockages in heart arteries causing the heart muscle not to function effectively .
DELAYING DEATHS
Implantable cardioverter - defibrillators or ICDs , are known to reduce the risk of death .
In the study that served as the basis of the new findings , Medtronic ICDs reduced the death rate by 23 percent over nearly four years .
Using data from the Sudden Cardiac Death in Heart Failure Trial , Poole and her colleagues followed the cases of 811 people with defibrillators .
Any shock increased the risk of death , they found .
Another study from the same trial , also published in the Journal , found that ICDs seem to provide short - term comfort for patients during the first year , although the psychological benefit disappeared at the 30 - month mark .
The exception , not surprisingly , came among patients who had received a shock in the previous month or two .
That study , led by Dr. Daniel Mark of Duke University Medical Center in Durham , North Carolina , used quality - of - life tests to assess the psychological well - being of 833 volunteers who received standard medical care , 830 who got additional drug treatment with amiodarone , also known by the Wyeth - Ayerst Pharmaceuticals brand name Cordarone , and 816 who received Medtronic ICDs .
“ One concern is that the use of ICD therapy could trade a quick , relatively painless ( albeit premature ) death for a more unpleasant death from progressive deterioration of the underlying heart disease or a coexisting illness , ” the researchers wrote .
But Healey and Connolly said that should not be surprising .
“ In severe chronic conditions , most worthwhile interventions only modestly delay death , ” they wrote .
In South Africa , a total of 139 A( H1N1 ) viruses have been isolated during the 2008 influenza season to date .
Of those , 107 isolates have been tested for oseltamivir resistance by the National Institute of Communicable Diseases ( NICD ) and 100 % were found to be resistant to oseltamivir by genotypic analysis .
From Australia , 10 of 10 A( H1N1 ) viruses tested , and from Chile , 4 of 32 A ( H1N1 ) viruses tested showed the specific neuraminidase mutation ( H274Y ) associated with oseltamivir resistance .
The above comments suggest that Tamiflu ( oseltamivir ) resistance ( H274Y ) is running at 100 % in South Africa and Australia , strongly suggesting that similar levels will be seen in the upcoming flu season in the northern hemisphere .
The latest update extends earlier results from South Africa , which included analysis of the first 23 isolates .
All contained H274Y , which was confirmed by the release of 16 HA and NA sequences .
The sequences fell into two sub-clades and one of the sub-clades had 5 clustered polymorphisms near the receptor binding domain position of 190 ( H3 numbering ) .
Three of these five changes were non-synonymous , raising concerns that the H1 was rapidly evolving away from the Brisbane / 59 sequences , which are the target of the northern hemisphere vaccine , which will be released in the next few months .
Moreover , the two polymorphisms from the 3 ’ side of the cluster matched H1N1 sequences from the 1940 ’s
The detection of H274Y in all 107 isolates sequenced , coupled with 100 % in Australian isolates , indicates that those isolates with H274Y are becoming dominant .
These sequences may be linked to recent reports of high frequency pneumonia levels in Zimbabwe .
More information of the severity of the H1N1 cases in South Africa and Australia would be useful .

[ digg - reddit - me ] Steven Lee Myers of the New York Times reported yesterday on Cheney ’s visits to former Soviet states :
Mr. Cheney , who visited Azerbaijan , Georgia and Ukraine this week to express American support , offered no new proposals either , but he described the conflict as a new test for NATO that required a unified response .
This has been the baffling and fundamental flaw of the neoconservative approach to foreign policy .
How America responded to 9/11 , how America endured the occupation of Iraq , how America responded to the Iranian ’s development of nuclear weapons , how America responded to Russian aggression in Georgia – each of these represented – in the words of Bush , Cheney , McCain , and other neoconservatives – a “ test ” of America ’s and our allies ’ resolve .
Yet – the neoconservatives only offer a single way for America to pass each of these tests : Escalate matters until America can plausibly threaten to use military force .
That was America ’s justifiable response to 9/11 .
It was the Bush administration ’s strategy with Saddam Hussein .
It has been Cheney ’s strategy for containing Iran .
It is McCain ’s strategy for confronting Russia .
The reason neoconservatives are so eager to use military force – instead of diplomacy , containment , alliances , creating and living by systems of rules for international affairs , or economic pressure – is that they believe America ’s military might can solve any problem .
They are correct that our military superiority ensures that we can defeat any other military on the planet .
But what they do not acknowledge is that the military is a blunt weapon and that without a draft , it can only be deployed under limited circumstances and for limited periods .
The wars in Afghanistan and Iraq demonstrate these lessons – yet McCain , Bush , Cheney , and company do not seem to have noticed .
Thus , McCain invoked Kennedy ’s defense of Berlin when Russia invaded Georgia – saying , “ We are all Georgians ! ” Kennedy had proclaimed , “ Eich bin ein Berlinier ” to demonstrate our resolve to the Soviet Union – that if they tried to take Berlin , we would protect it as if it were our own home .
McCain , by saying that we are all Georgians , was committing the United States to take military action against Russia .
Yet , if that is his plan , he has not admitted it .
If it is not his plan , then he has not been following the advice given by his hero , Teddy Roosevelt :
Speak softly , and carry a big stick .
McCain talks a good game – but if he means half of what he says , we ’ll have more than one new war on our hands by the time he ’s through .
Either way , he ’s not the president I ’m hoping for .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The Bush administration has launched a " significant escalation " of covert operations in Iran , sending U.S. commandos to spy on the country 's nuclear facilities and undermine the Islamic republic 's government , journalist Seymour Hersh said Sunday .
An Iranian flag flies outside the building containing the reactor of Bushehr nuclear power plant , south of Tehran .
White House , CIA and State Department officials declined comment on Hersh 's report , which appears in this week 's issue of The New Yorker .
Hersh told CNN's " Late Edition with Wolf Blitzer " that Congress has authorized up to $ 400 million to fund the secret campaign , which involves U.S. special operations troops and Iranian dissidents .
President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney have rejected findings from U.S. intelligence agencies that Iran has halted a clandestine effort to build a nuclear bomb and " do not want to leave Iran in place with a nuclear program , " Hersh said .
" They believe that their mission is to make sure that before they get out of office next year , either Iran is attacked or it stops its weapons program , " Hersh said .
The new article , " Preparing the Battlefield , " is the latest in a series of articles accusing the Bush administration of preparing for war with Iran .
He based the report on accounts from current and former military , intelligence , and congressional sources .
Watch Hersh discuss what he says are the administration 's plans for Iran »
" As usual with his quarterly pieces , we 'll decline to comment , " White House spokesman Gordon Johndroe told CNN .
" The CIA , as a rule , does not comment on allegations regarding covert operations , " CIA spokesman Paul Gimigliano said .
Ryan Crocker , the U.S. ambassador in Baghdad , denied U.S. raids were being launched from Iraq , where American commanders believe Iran is stoking sectarian warfare and fomenting attacks on U.S. troops .
" I can tell you flatly that U.S. forces are not operating across the Iraqi border into Iran , in the south or anywhere else , " Crocker said .
Hersh said U.S. efforts were staged from Afghanistan , which also shares a border with Iran .
He said the program resulted in " a dramatic increase in kinetic events and chaos " inside Iran , including attacks by Kurdish separatists in the country 's north and a May attack on a mosque in Shiraz that killed 13 people .
The United States has said it is trying to isolate Iran diplomatically in order to get it to come clean about its nuclear ambitions .
But Bush has said " all options " are open in dealing with the issue .
Iran insists its nuclear program is aimed at providing civilian electric power , and refuses to comply with U.N. Security Council demands that it halt uranium enrichment work .
U.N. nuclear inspectors say Tehran held back critical information that could determine whether it is trying to make nuclear weapons .
Israel , which is believed to have its own nuclear arsenal , conducted a military exercise in the eastern Mediterranean in early June involving dozens of warplanes and aerial tankers .
The distance involved in the exercise was roughly the same as would be involved in a possible strike on the Iranian nuclear fuel plant at Natanz , Iran , a U.S. military official said .
In 1981 , Israeli warplanes destroyed an Iraqi nuclear reactor .
Iran 's parliament speaker , Ali Larijani , warned other countries against moves that would " cost them heavily . "
In comments that appeared in the semi-official Mehr news agency Sunday , an Iranian general said his troops were digging more than 320,000 graves to bury troops from any invading force with " the respect they deserve . "
" Under the law of war and armed conflict , necessary preparations must be made for the burial of soldiers of aggressor nations , " said Maj .

DENVER , Colorado ( CNN ) -- Sen. Edward Kennedy declared there was " new hope " for the nation in his surprise appearance at the Democratic National Convention , while Michelle Obama addressed critics of her patriotism and stressed her love for the country .
Sen .
Edward Kennedy makes a surprise speech before a roaring crowd at the convention .

" Nothing is going to keep me away from this special gathering tonight , " Kennedy told an arena of teary - eyed delegates as he pledged to see Barack Obama to the White House and his own return to the Senate floor .
Before the convention , the ailing liberal icon had made only one public appearance since undergoing surgery for a brain tumor on June 2 .
Before his remarks , his niece , Caroline Kennedy , introduced a video that paid tribute to his life and the causes he has fought for throughout his more than 45 - year tenure in the Senate .
Watch highlights from the opening night »
The reception Kennedy got was reminiscent of the reception that his brother , Robert , got in 1964 when he addressed the convention after their brother John was assassinated , said Bill Schneider , a CNN senior political analyst .
The crowd was perhaps a little sentimental , Schneider said because " they 're very aware that it may be the last major speech he ever gives .
They 're hopeful it's not -- but fearful it might be . "
Watch Kennedy 's words fire up delegates »
Republican strategist Alex Castellanos said Kennedy 's speech would be " one of the highlights of the evening if not the entire Democratic convention , " and CNN contributor James Carville called it " the most emotional thing I have ever seen . "
" I do n't care if you 're a Democrat or a Republican -- you 're going to be moved by that , " he said .
The Democratic convention culminates Thursday when Obama formally accepts his party 's nomination .
Obama , the junior senator from Illinois , will become the first African - American to lead a major party ticket .
His wife of nearly 16 years , Michelle Obama , told the packed convention center stories from when she and Obama first met .
The woman known as " the rock " in the Obama family also introduced herself as a sister , a mother and a " wife who loves my husband and believes he will be an extraordinary president . "
" This is the first time most Americans are getting any sense of who Michelle Obama really is .
She 's a very poised and accomplished speaker , a real professional , " Schneider said .
Obama said her " piece of the American Dream is a blessing hard won by those who came before me , " and praised both Sens. Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden for opening up opportunities for others .

" All of us driven by a simple belief that the world as it is just wo n't do -- that we have an obligation to fight for the world as it should be .
" That is the thread that connects our hearts .
That is the thread that runs through my journey and Barack 's journey and so many other improbable journeys that have brought us here tonight , where the current of history meets this new tide of hope .
" That is why I love this country , " she said before the cheering audience .
The potential first lady caused controversy earlier in the campaign season when she said she was really proud of the United States for the " first time " in her adult life .
Those comments were replayed in attack ads from Republicans .
Craig Robinson , Michelle Obama 's brother , spoke briefly before his sister took the stage .
" I do n't want to just introduce my sister , I want to introduce you to my sister .
The girl I grew up with .
The poised young woman I saw her grow in to .
The compassionate mother , aunt and sister - in - law she is .
The passionate voice for women and children she has become .
And the type of first lady she will be , " he said before sharing memories from their childhood .
Barack Obama addressed the delegates in a short message via satellite at the conclusion of his wife 's speech .
" Now you know why I asked her out so many times , even though she said no .
You want a persistent president , " he joked .
Obama 's two daughters , Sasha and Malia , grabbed the mic to give their father a quick " hello . "
Obama watched his wife 's speech from Kansas City , Missouri , where he is scheduled to campaign Tuesday .

Monday night 's theme was " One Nation . "
Other speakers included Democratic Party Chairman Howard Dean , House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr .
Former Republican Rep. Jim Leach of Iowa , who endorsed Obama and recommended Republican Rep. Chuck Hagel as a vice presidential candidate , also addressed the opening night of the convention .

While Kennedy and Michelle Obama earned rave reviews , analysts said the hours leading up to their appearances were largely uneventful .
" If this party has a message , it 's done a hell of a job of hiding it , " said Carville , who was a strategist for Bill Clinton 's presidential campaign .
Bill Bennett , a political analyst for CNN who served in Republican administrations , said it was " stunning " how little substance was offered up in the first two hours of the convention .
" Having worked on the choreography of these before , you need to grab people 's attention with a message early on ... not to let these sort of hours get frittered away , " he said .
Tuesday 's lineup will likely be dramatic , as Hillary Clinton delivers the headline speech .
Clinton and Obama battled it out in their protracted primary season , and questions still linger over whether her supporters are ready to rally behind her formal rival .
Wednesday night features an address from former President Bill Clinton , as well as a speech from Joe Biden , the newly tapped vice presidential candidate .
Going into the start of the back - to - back conventions , Obama and presumptive Republican nominee John McCain were tied in the race for the White House , according to a new poll .
In a CNN / Opinion Research Corp. poll released Sunday night -- after Obama announced Biden as his running mate , 47 percent of those questioned are backing Obama , with an equal amount supporting McCain .
The poll was conducted on Saturday and Sunday , with 1,023 adult Americans questioned by telephone .
The survey 's sampling error is plus or minus 3.5 percentage points for all voters .

Hint , to align the end of a structure to the alignment requirement of a particular type , end the format with the code for that type with a repeat count of zero .
For example , the format " llh0l " specified two pad bytes at the end , assuming longs are aligned on 4 - byte boundaries .
This only works when native size and alignment are in effect ; standard size and alignment does not enforce any alignment .

The Global Environment for Network Innovations believes that almost 20 years is enough to classify the Internet as " outdated " .
GENI is now attempting to do what no one would have ever imagined : rebuild the entire Internet infrastructure .
With the Internet being such an integral part of our lives , it 's difficult to remember how people functioned in the pre-online era .
Instead of marvelling at the fact that we have an endless supply of information at our disposal , we complain that our software and products are outdated , slow , and difficult to manage .
Without even realizing it , we create a never - ending chain of supply and demand : days become months , our software / devices get older , companies invest millions of dollars to update their products and we purchase these " new " commodities .
While Al Gore would have us believe that he was the one responsible for inventing the Internet , the coalition assuming the challenge of updating the Internet is actually BBN Technologies , an advanced technologies solutions firm .
The Global Environment for Network Innovations is one of the many difficult projects BBN Tech hopes to conquer in the near future .
( Source : newstin.com )
To physically break down and rebuild the Internet , GENI will enlist the services of 29 university research teams .
BBN
Tech has not only received the proverbial " green light " to pursue the project , the company will also receive $ 12 million in government funding , as well as bandwidth from two separate research hubs .
While $ 12 million may seem like a substantial amount for research purposes , the U.S. government is doling out the money in the form of a three - year grant which will actually give the company roughly $ 4 million per year .
( Source : cnet.com )
BBN
Tech is also seeking an additional $ 3.5 million per year from outside investors , claiming that more finances leads to better research opportunities .
GENI has sparked the interest of several other organizations , such as Internet2 and National LambdaRail , which will supply the project with additional bandwidth .
While nothing appears to be problematic with the current Internet infrastructure , BBN Tech argues that having a new infrastructure will ensure that future developments in technology will be carried out much more smoothly .
GENI will hold initial research sessions either late this year or early next year .
The market was 500 trades away from Armageddon on Thursday , traders inside two large custodial banks tell The Post .
Had the Treasury and Fed not quickly stepped into the fray that morning with a quick $ 105 billion injection of liquidity , the Dow could have collapsed to the 8,300 - level – a 22 percent decline !
– while the clang of the opening bell was still echoing around the cavernous exchange floor .
According to traders , who spoke on the condition of anonymity , money market funds were inundated with $ 500 billion in sell orders prior to the opening .
The total money - market capitalization was roughly $ 4 trillion that morning .
The panicked selling was directly linked to the seizing up of the credit markets – including a $ 52 billion constriction in commercial paper – and the rumors of additional money market funds “ breaking the buck , ” or dropping below $ 1 net asset value .
The Fed ’s dramatic $ 105 billion liquidity injection on Thursday ( pre-market ) was just enough to keep key institutional accounts from following through on the sell orders and starting a stampede of cash that could have brought large tracts of the US economy to a halt .
While many depositors treat money market accounts as fancy savings accounts , they are different .
Banks buy a variety of short - term debt , including commercial paper , with the assets .
It is an important distinction because banks use the $ 1.7 trillion commercial - paper market to fund their credit card operations and car finance companies use it to move autos .
Without commercial paper , “ factories would have to shut down , people would lose their jobs and there would be an effect on the real economy , ” Paul Schott Stevens , of the Investment Company Institute , told the Wall Street Journal .
Cracks started to show in money market accounts late Tuesday when shares in one fund , the Reserve Primary Fund – which touted itself as super safe – fell below the golden $ 1 a share level .
It had purchased what it thought was safe Lehman bonds , never dreaming they could default – which they did 24 hours earlier when the 158 - year - old investment bank filed Chapter 11 .
By Wednesday , banks sensed a run on their accounts .
They started stockpiling cash in anticipation of withdrawals .
Banks , which usually keep an average of $ 2 billion in excess reserves earmarked for withdrawals , pumped that up to an astounding $ 90 billion by Wednesday , Lou Crandall , chief economist at Wrighton ICAP , told The Journal .
And for good reason .
By the close of business on Wednesday , $ 144.5 billion – a record – had been withdrawn .
How much money was taken out of money market funds the prior week ?
Roughly $ 7.1 billion , according to AMG Data Services .
By Thursday , that level , fed by the incredible volume of sell orders pouring in from institutional investors like pension funds and sovereign funds , had grown to $ 100 billion .
It was still not enough to stem the tidal wave .
The banks knew something drastic had to be done .
So did Paulson .
The injection of capital into the market was followed up by calls from Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson to major money market players like Bank of New York Mellon and State Street in Boston informing them that federal money was in the market and they should tell their clients the Feds would be back with a plan to stem the constriction in the credit market .
Paulson knew the $ 105 billion injection was not a real solution .
A broader , more radical answer was needed .
Hours after Paulson made his round of calls to calm the industry , word leaked out that an added $ 1 trillion bailout of banks was being readied .
Investors cheered .
At about 3 p.m. , news of the plans was filtering up and down Wall Street , fueling a 700 - point advance in the Dow Jones industrial average through 4 p.m. Friday .
By that time , Paulson had announced the plan .
It included insurance on money market accounts , a move that started in quiet Thursday morning , when the former Goldman Sachs executive saved the country from a paralyzing meltdown .

The United States , Mr. McCain added , “ maintains a military presence there , but a much smaller one , and it does not play a direct combat role . ”
During his primary battle , Mr. McCain accused his rival Mitt Romney of setting a timetable for withdrawing troops from Iraq , even though Mr. Romney was merely speaking generally about timetables that might be set in private discussions among Iraqi and American leaders .
Since then , Mr. McCain himself has come under repeated fire from the Democrats for his support of the war and for offhand comments that he could envision a United States peacekeeping presence in Iraq for 100 years .
Despite his mention of a specific year for the end of American combat operations , Mr. McCain and his aides strenuously argued afterward that his remarks should not be interpreted as promoting a timetable for withdrawal , even implicitly , and that he was simply projecting victory .
“ I am certainly not putting a date on it , ” Mr. McCain said with exasperation during a circular , semantic debate in the back of his campaign bus .
Mr. McCain took issue when a reporter said the candidate had asked everyone to go along on a “ magic carpet ride ” to 2013 .
“ I do n’t think it has anything to do with fantasy , ” Mr. McCain said pointedly .
“ I think it has everything to do with setting goals and achieving . ”
In Afghanistan by 2013 , Mr. McCain predicted in his speech , intelligence will have led to the capture or death of Osama bin Laden .
In addition , Mr. McCain forecast , the threat from the Taliban will have been “ greatly reduced ” ; there will be no place in the world that Al Qaeda can consider a safe haven ; and “ there still has not been a major terrorist attack in the United States since Sept. 11 , 2001 . ”
As part of the Palin hack news story the use of the CTunnel tool was mentioned as the anonymous proxy service used by the “ hacker ” .
The FBI is seeking records from the people behind CTunnel in connection to the investigation .
After a quick look at the CTunnel website , this turns up , in reference to the CTunnel logging and retention of data .
“ Because our visitors value their privacy , it is not in our interests to spy on you , lest we lose traffic and advertising revenue .
Because government subpenoa could require us to hand over our server access logs , access logs are regularly deleted to protect your privacy .
In short , we value your browsing experience as well as your anonymity , and would not do anything to break your trust in us . ”
But then look what this sell out that owns Ctunnel Gabriel Ramuglia , tells Threat Level , he says that the FBI had contacted him yesterday to obtain his traffic logs .
that he has about 80 gigabytes of logs to process and had n’t yet looked for the information the FBI was seeking but planned to be in touch with the agents today ( September 18 ) .
Due to the hacker being tracked down , a college student in TN you could say that Ctunnel did their part in bending
Ramuglia said the screenshots of Palin ’s e-mail account , which the hacker posted online , will help him narrow his search , since they revealed most of the Ctunnel URL that was at the top of the hacker ’s browser when he took the screen shot .
so if Ctunnel , goes against what he specifically said he would n’t do , then what about other cases he did not even mention ?
what if your girlfriend calls up ?
boss ?
local detective ?
crooked police officer ?
probation officer ?
the list can go on … but in the end its a sad day for internet advocates and net neutrality everywhere , Palin should not have been using this Yahoo account on business , and she should have used stronger security measures , particularly if there is sensitive information .
Scientists have long been fascinated by structure of bone .
Bone is very light but can withstand heavy pressure and he inside is like a sponge so bone is firm and compact in certain places and porous in others .
The construction industry would love to have materials like bone .
Researchers at the Fraunhofer Institute for Manufacturing Engineering and Applied Materials Research have developed a simulation program that calculates the internal structure and density distribution of bone material and , from that , the scientists were able to derive the material structure for other components .
The program simulates how the structure needs to be built in order to meet the specified requirements .
An individual jawbone implant " baked " from powdered metal .
Credit : Fraunhofer IFAM
The researchers have now managed to put these simulations successfully into practice and engineers can produce complex components with the aid of rapid prototyping technology .
This involves coating a surface with wafer - thin layers of special metal powder .
A laser beam heats , or sinters , the powdered metal in the exact places that need to be firm .
" It 's like baking a cake , " says Andreas Burblies , spokesman for the Fraunhofer Numerical Simulation of Products , Processes Alliance .
Any remaining loose powder is subsequently removed .
" The end product is an open - pored element , " explains Burblies .
" Each point possesses exactly the right density and thus also a certain stability . "
The method allows the engineers to produce particularly lightweight components , customized for each application , that are also extremely robust .
In the meantime , the researchers have further enhanced the process to the point where they can actually change the internal structure of the parts after production by means of precision drilling .
" We can manufacture and adapt the parts exactly as required , " says Burblies .
This makes the technique very attractive to a number of industries , among them the manufacturers of bone implants .
It is easy to produce individual implants with an internal structure that resembles the patient 's bone .
Metal powders made of biomaterials such as titanium and steel alloys make it possible to reconstruct other bone elements , such as parts of the knee .
And it goes without saying that the lightweight construction industry , especially aircraft , automobile and machine manufacturers , all benefit from the robust workpieces , as they are better able to withstand stress of every kind .

In case you want to identify a man 's level of aggressiveness just look at his face .
According to a new study the rounder is a man 's face the more aggressive he is .
A team of Canadian specialists performed a study and discovered that the shape of a man 's face depends on the level of testosterone , male sex hormone .
A rounder face means higher level of testosterone and thus more aggressiveness .
Scientists say that the shape of the face was honed by evolution as an indicator of the tendency to act aggressively .
" ( Our ) findings suggest that people can make accurate inferences about others ' personality traits and behavioral dispositions based on certain signals conveyed by the face , " said Cheryl McCormick of Brock University , lead researcher .
The results of the study , performed by McCormick and his colleagues , are based on the examination of the aggression level in 90 professional hockey players .
They linked the facial ratio with the number of penalty minutes received in one game .
Penalties were given to sportsmen who showed aggressive behavior through slashing , elbowing , fighting and the like .
Scientists discovered that the rounder a sportsman 's face was the more aggressiveness he showed .
The study did not find any connections between the face shape and aggression in women .
" The facial structure of a man provides an indication of how aggressive he will be in a competitive situation .
So , we are able to predict , with some accuracy , the behavior of men on the basis of their facial features , " researchers said .
The study 's findings were published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society : Biological Sciences .

Nicolaus Copernicus ( 1473 –1543 ) , a mathematician and astronomer , questioned the long - held belief that the Earth sits at the center of the universe and the Sun and planets circle around it .
Aristotle posited and Ptolemy ( 85 –165 ) codified this geocentric ( Earth - centered ) system .
But in his On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres , published in 1543 , Copernicus said that they had it backwards .
He concluded that the Sun is at the center of the cosmos , and the Earth and other planets revolve around it .
This book altered the direction in which scientific thought developed .
Aristotle , for example , reckoned that the reason objects fall to earth is that they seek their natural place at the center of the universe .
With the Earth displaced to a secondary role in a heliocentric ( Sun-centered ) system , a new explanation for this phenomenon was needed , which Isaac Newton provided a century - and - a - half later with his Law of Gravitation .
Peter H. Duesberg ( b.1936 ) is a molecular biologist .
He is Professor of Molecular and Cell Biology at the University of California , Berkeley .
Duesberg questions , on a submicroscopic scale , two tenets of biology .
One is the germ theory of AIDS .
He contends that HIV is not the cause of AIDS .
The other is the gene mutation hypothesis of cancer .
Duesberg claims that mutations in genes are not the cause of cancer .
Harvey Bialy has written a book about Duesberg titled Oncogenes , Aneuploidy , and AIDS : A Scientific Life & Times of Peter H. Duesberg ( 2004 ) .
Bialy is founding scientific editor of Nature Biotechnology , a molecular biologist , and a poet .
He recounts Duesberg ’s rise and fall in the world of mainstream science , beginning with the recognition he and co-worker Peter Vogt received in 1970 for biochemically defining the first retroviral oncogene , found in birds .
( An oncogene is a gene , viral derived or not , associated with cancer . )
Bialy portrays Duesberg as having " a furious intellect " ; an " encyclopedic knowledge of a vast scientific literature , in several languages " ; and " tenacity . "
In Uncentering the Earth : Copernicus and the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres ( 2006 ) , William Vollman praises Copernicus for having the good sense to die shortly after the publication of his paradigm - altering work , thus avoiding the cruel punishment then accorded heretics .
So far , this has been Duesberg ’s fate : Admired as a " wunderkind " in the 1970s , the NIH ( National Institutes of Health ) awarded him a long - term Outstanding Investigator Grant ; he was a candidate for the Nobel Prize ; the U.S. National Academy of Science , in 1985 , invited him to join the academy , a high honor among scientists , especially for one then only 49 years old ; and in 1986 he was awarded a Fogarty fellowship to spend a year at the NIH studying cancer genes .
But in 1987 Duesberg ran afoul of the establishment .
He published a paper in Cancer Research titled " Retroviruses as Carcinogens and Pathogens : Expectations and Reality , " followed a year later by one in Science , " HIV is Not the Cause of AIDS . "
Thereafter , Duesberg was subjected to the punishment now accorded modern - day heretics .
The NIH ceased giving him grants ( the NIH and other federal and state funding sources have rejected his last 21 consecutive research grant applications ) , colleagues labeled him " irresponsible and pernicious " ( David Baltimore ) and his work " absolute and total nonsense " ( Robert Gallo ) , and graduate students at Berkeley were advised not to study with Duesberg if they wanted to go on and have a successful career in biology .
He was branded a " rebel , " a " maverick , " an " iconoclast , " and by one writer , in an article in Science in 1988 titled " A Rebel Without a Cause of AIDS , " a " gadfly . "
Blocked from receiving grants , he obtained private funds to maintain his laboratory at UC Berkeley , and he now spends part of each year doing research in Germany .
His principle work on HIV / AIDS is Inventing the AIDS Virus , published in 1996 .
In this book , and in other papers he has written on the subject , Duesberg systematically dismantles , piece by piece , the germ theory of AIDS .
This theory / hypothesis has two parts : 1 ) HIV causes AIDS , and 2 ) HIV is sexually transmitted .
With regard to sexual transmission , only 1 in 1,000 unprotected sexual contacts transmit HIV .
One in 275 U.S. citizens has antibodies to this virus .
Therefore , an uninfected person could have up to 275,000 random unprotected sexual contacts without acquiring sexually transmitted HIV .
Prostitutes do not get AIDS , unless they are drug addicts ; and wives of HIV - positive hemophiliacs do not contract AIDS from their husbands .
Proponents of the HIV / AIDS hypothesis ignore these facts .
The dire heterosexual AIDS epidemic predicted to occur in the U.S. , Canada , and Europe twenty years ago has not happened , and the disease remains confined to the original two main risk groups — gay men ( 66 percent of all AIDS cases ) and intravenous drug users , male and female ( 32 percent ) .
The other 2 percent are hemophiliacs and babies born to mothers who used intravenous drugs during pregnancy .
The easiest way to acquire HIV sexually is through receptive anal intercourse .
Unlike other viruses , which cause diseases such as smallpox , mumps , and herpes , a retrovirus is like a hitchhiker going along for the ride .
It enters a cell , mixes its genes up with those the cell possesses and aligns its fate with that of the cell .
Retroviral genes make up an estimated 8 percent of the approximately 35,000 genes in the human genome .
It is not in the retrovirus ’ self - interest to destroy the cell it lives in .
Its survival is contingent on the host cell staying healthy .
But HIV ( Human Immunodeficiency Virus ) , a retrovirus , supposedly causes AIDS ( Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ) by killing the T cell it infects .
Without an adequate number of T cells immunodeficiency results , rendering a person susceptible to AIDS .
As Duesberg points out , however , two important facts argue against this model : HIV infects , at most , only 1 in 500 T cells .
And T cells infected with HIV placed in a test tube ( in vitro ) grow and thrive .
The cells do not die .
Instead , they manufacture large quantities of the virus , which providers use to detect antibodies to HIV in their patients ’ blood .
For these and a dozen other reasons , the germ theory of AIDS is wrong .
HIV is a harmless passenger on the AIDS airplane , not its pilot .
Perhaps Duesberg ’s final statement on HIV / AIDS will be “ The Chemical Bases of the Various AIDS Epidemics : Recreational Drugs , Anti-viral Chemotherapy and Malnutrition , ” published in 2003 .
Rebel he may be , as Science avers , but Duesberg is not without a cause for AIDS .
He wrote this paper with Claus Koehnlein and David Rasnick .
I heard Dr. Rasnick , also a Professor of Molecular and Cell Biology at UC Berkeley , present this paper at the 2003 meeting of the Doctors for Disaster Preparedness .
They hypothesize that AIDS is caused by three things , singly or in combination : 1 ) long - term , heavy - duty recreational drug use — cocaine , amphetamines , heroin , and nitrite inhalants ; 2 ) antiretroviral drugs doctors prescribe to people who are HIV positive — DNA chain terminators , like AZT , and protease inhibitors ; and 3 ) malnutrition and bad water , which is the cause of " AIDS " in Africa .
AIDS appeared in young gay men in the early 1980s following an explosion of recreational drug use that began twenty years earlier in the 1960s .
Male homosexuals are the highest users of recreational drugs .
AZT , given to people who are HIV - positive , first used in 1987 , is another cause of AIDS .
As Duesberg and coauthors show in this paper , a chemical ( noninfectious ) basis for AIDS is supported by a lot of important data .
One fact is this , which government spokespersons and the media do not report : HIV - positive people treated with antiretroviral drugs have a four to five times higher annual mortality rate compared to HIV - positive people who refuse treatment with these drugs — 6.6 –8.7 percent vs. 1.4 percent .
Duesberg writes , " AIDS is stabilized , even cured , if patients stop using recreational drugs or AZT — regardless of the presence of HIV .
The drug hypothesis predicts that AIDS is an entirely preventable and in part curable disease . "
There are other , larger societal issues that resonate around AIDS .
In AIDS : Virus or Drug Induced ( 1996 ) , Duesberg writes :
The AIDS virus [ HIV ] also proved to be the politically correct cause of AIDS .
No AIDS risk groups [ e.g. , gay men ] could be blamed for being infected by a God - given egalitarian virus .
A virus could reach all of us .
Nobody would be ostracized since u2018 We are all in this together . ’
Not so with drugs .
The consumption of illicit psychoactive drugs implies individual and social responsibilities that nobody wanted to face …
The perceived danger of an AIDS virus decimating the general public also provided the scientific and moral arguments for quick and unreflective action and for the complete dismissal of the competing drug - AIDS hypothesis .
Pope Clement VII encouraged Copernicus to publish his work , and On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres is dedicated to his successor , Pope Paul III .
The Catholic Church supported his research , but Martin Luther and other Protestant reformers denounced it .
The Holy See accepted Copernicus ’ heliocentric system as a hypothesis , one which made determining holy days , Easter in particular , easier .
Galileo ( 1564–1642 ) subsequently mounted a " Copernicus Crusade " and proclaimed the hypothesis a fact , which the Church to censure him and place him under house arrest , an action it now regrets .
It was appropriate , however , to treat Copernicus ’ heliocentric system as a hypothesis , which has turned out not to be entirely true .
We now know the sun is not stationary but rotates around the center of the Milky Way Galaxy with its planets in tow .
Kary Mullis , who won the Nobel Prize in 1993 for inventing the polymerase chain reaction , now used to measure HIV " viral load , " states in his book Dancing Naked in the Mind Field ( 1998 ) , " Years from now , people will find our acceptance of the HIV theory of AIDS as silly as we find those who excommunicated Galileo . "
While Duesberg continues to be vilified for his contrarian view of AIDS , investigators are increasingly willing to consider his equally contrarian view of cancer .
Chapter Six of Bialy ’s Oncogenes , Aneuploidy , and AIDS : A Scientific Life & Times of Peter H. Duesberg deals with this subject and is titled " The Phoenix Almost Rises . "
The media do not report his work on cancer so as not to " legitimize " him .
( The New York Times has made no mention of it . )
One exception is Scientific American .
It published an article in its July 2003 issue titled " Untangling the Roots of Cancer " written by one of its senior writers .
The article lists , in a timeline illustration , the 12 most important events in the evolution of cancer theory over the last 100 years .
Number 10 in this list , occurring in 1999 , is : " Peter Duesberg publishes detailed theory of how aneuploidy may be sufficient to cause cancer itself , even without mutations to any particular sets of genes . "
Normal human cells have 46 chromosomes , 23 from each parent .
They are euploid ( contain the correct number of chromosomes ) .
Aneuploidy means the cell has an abnormal number and balance of chromosomes ( strands of DNA consisting of many genes and other elements ) , either too many or too few .
All solid tumor cancer cells have an abnormal number of chromosomes , usually ranging from 60 to 90 .
Colon cancer cells contain an average of 79 chromosomes .
Cells that have an abnormal number of chromosomes can become cancerous by constantly altering their number and composition in succeeding generations of cells until at some point , perhaps decades later , one of these genetically unbalanced cells turns malignant .
And since aneuploidy is inherently unstable , cancer cells continually spawn new cells with differing numbers and assortments of chromosomes and therefore a unique genetic makeup ( karyotype ) .
This enables the cancer to survive when threatened by chemotherapy and radiation because a subpopulation of its cells becomes genetically resistant to these challenges .
The aneuploidy cancer hypothesis better explains why these treatments offer only a remission ( while the surviving subpopulation regroups ) and not a cure for cancer .
This hypothesis shifts the focus to on how to prevent cancer rather than trying to find a cure .
Three important papers Duesberg has written on this subject , with private support , are " How Aneuploidy Affects Metabolic Control and Causes Cancer ( 1999 ) , " with David Rasnick ; " Aneuploidy , the Somatic Mutation that Makes Cancer a Species of Its Own ( 2000 ) , " with Rasnick ; and " Aneuploidy , the Primary Cause of the Multilateral Genomic Instability of Neoplastic and Preneoplastic Cells ( 2004 ) , " with Alice Fabarius and Ruediger Hehlmann .
Postulating a viral etiology for most cancers , the " War on Cancer " launched by President Nixon in 1971 focused on viruses , with the prospect of a viral anti-cancer vaccine to come .
When this line of investigation went nowhere , in the 1980s the virus - centered system of cancer morphed into a virus - centered view of AIDS ; and the gene mutation hypothesis superseded viruses as the cause of cancer .
Now Duesberg , in Copernican fashion , is replacing the genocentric ( gene- centered ) model of cancer with aneuploidy .
This paradigm shift in understanding cancer , the second most common cause of death in our species , will have far - reaching consequences .
The incidence of cancer in the U.S. has more than doubled over the last century .
Newer treatment modalities , such as chemotherapy and radiation , have provided little , if any , benefit in ( long - term ) survival rates .
The aneuploidy - centered system of cancer explains why it has been so difficult to find a cure for cancer , and research dollars would be better invested seeking ways to prevent it .
Studies on environmental triggers — carcinogens and nutritional factors — that foster aneuploidy need to be funded and done .
When Duesberg ’s work on HIV / AIDS and cancer is finally recognized and accepted , it will cause a revolution in science .
Over the last 50 years government - sponsored and industry - sponsored research programs have come to dominate scientific research .
A totalitarian system now exists where only scientists that adhere to the prevailing orthodoxy can receive funds to conduct research .
Not only will the government not fund studies on alternative hypotheses for AIDS and cancer , but this stricture applies to other areas of inquiry .
All research on climate change must conform to the dogma of human - caused global warming , and studies on vaccines dare not criticize their safety or efficacy .
No government grants will be awarded to anyone who wants to study radiation hormesis — and question the linear no -threshold hypothesis .
Studies published that support the reigning dogma are riddled with conflicts of interest , manipulated statistics , and bias .
Once the HIV - AIDS hypothesis is acknowledged to be false , a domino effect will impact other branches of science that government now controls .
Academic leaders in the inner circle of the medical - industrial - government complex will be called to account .
Industry will likely face lawsuits .
And government agencies , particularly the NIH , CDC ( Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ) , and FDA ( Food and Drug Administration ) will have a lot to answer for .
Duesberg ’s work will do to biology and science in this century what Copernicus did to astronomy and science five centuries ago .
In an interview conducted by the Berkeley Science Review , Peter Duesberg was asked , " If you could live your career again , would you change anything ? "
His reply : " I would possibly be more diplomatic than I was , when I first discovered the many paradoxes of the virus - AIDS hypothesis and of the now - prevailing gene mutation hypothesis of cancer .
But I would not be a scientist who ranks acceptance by the mainstream higher than scientific discovery .
Since we all live only once I would rather be respected by the next generation for a lasting scientific contribution , than by the current one for work that is popular now but scientifically flawed . "
For the 200,000 healthy , HIV - positive Americans who must take DNA chain terminators based on the belief that HIV causes AIDS , and the one out of every three Americans who will get cancer , one hopes that Peter Duesberg ’s work will be recognized and accepted soon .
More than 2,000 scientists , medical professionals , authors , and academics have now gone on record doubting the HIV / AID hypothesis .
Their comments are catalogued here .
People who read Harvey Bialy ’s beautifully written book about Duesberg , especially scientists , will come away with a new view of oncogenes , aneuploidy , and AIDS .

The Best of Donald W. Miller , Jr. , MD
Ever since the announcement that Alaska Governor Sarah Palin would be joining John McCain on the Republican ticket , much of the media focus ( or should that be furore ? ) has concentrated on her personal life and beliefs .
In terms of energy policy , the general ‘ knee jerk ’ view seems to have been that she ’s a staunch supporter of the ‘ drill , baby drill ’ school of thought , with little real analysis beyond that .
However , now that the dust is ( sort of ) starting to settle , some more sober analysis of the Vice Presidential candidate ’s record on renewable energy is starting to emerge .
For starters , as Alaskan Governor , there are signs that she may have paid more than lip service to her supposed support for alternatives to oil .
She promised green campaigners that she would put together a comprehensive plan on renewables , and even appointed someone to head up the mission .
Beyond this though , there has been little genuine conviction or leadership in support of the sector .
In fact , as the summary below reveals , her record on the issue is decidedly shaky :
In 2007 , she stalled the Fire Island Wind Farm Project by placing a veto on $ 20 million of state support .
Even though she later rescinded this decision , enabling the project to move ahead , she has vetoed a further $ 268 million in budget items this year , including other renewables projects ;
This same budget contributed $ 2 million towards a bizarre conference to “ highlight arguments that global warming is n’t threatening the survival of polar bears . ”
In opposition to the recommendations of state biologists , she has also argued against listing the polar bear as endangered ;
Due to lack of financial support , several renewable energy projects in the state have been stalled ;
The Alaskan policy of distributing the state ’s ‘ oil royalties fund ’ to residents , instead of ploughing it back into clean energy development , has led some commentators to suggest that any sort of large scale renewables infrastructure is doomed from the start .
The Anchorage Daily News pointed out that last year the handouts totalled $ 700 million , almost half the cost of a massive proposed hydropower project in Lake Chakachamna .
All this would seem to suggest that , under her watch , Alaska is unlikely to adopt the sort of go ahead policies on renewables that we ’ve seen in states like Colorado , Pennsylvania and Florida .
Will this trend be repeated nationally come next January ?
We ’ll just have to wait and see …

Intersection of 57th Street and Fifth Avenue . $ 1,500 per square foot .
Wall Street may be melting down a few miles south , but rents on New York 's prime retail corridor , Fifth Avenue between 50th and 58th streets , hit a record high this year .
With that kind of overhead , some retailers tend to view their stores here as expensive billboards instead of merchandise movers .
But others , helped by a crush of European tourists , are raking it in : Tiffany 's Fifth Avenue flagship saw sales of $ 7,500 per gross square foot last year , 10 % of the company 's total revenue .
It 's sad that the only news items that motivate the right - wing attack dogs are an affair by John Edwards , an affair that 's none of our business , but does well to detract from other scandals that are rife in the GOP and constantly pervade the White House .
Rush and Ann are silent in regard to Dick Cheney 's recent fiasco when he attempted to figure out how to start a war with Iran .
As this news settles in as another treasonous action by our Executive branch , right - wing radio is desperate to bring the nation 's attention to other issues that are non-starters in today 's political process , allowing them to spew their hate and deception to Americans who have been conditioned to trust them with real issues .
We are lied to and given inaccurate and , at times , completely false information .
It should be noted that right - wing radio hosts who dominate airwaves , are pushing an extremist doctrine and openly state that Liberals and some Democrats would be better off dead .
That 's their message .
And it 's being picked up by " loonies " who live to listen to hate and deception rather than to fact and truth .
If we disagree with our government , who has constantly lied to and deceived the American people , these hate - mongers imply that we are somehow " less American " or patriotic than they -- because we do n't buy into their fascist and warmongering agenda .
Lying to the American people should be a crime , as should promoting hate and violence .
But in today 's America , the hate - mongers are protected and the Liberal / Democrats face a rising array of brain - washed loony - tunes who buy into their constant barrage of hate and deception .
Rush Limbaugh almost takes the cake , and Ann Coulter is running a close second , both of whom may one day face backlash :
Rush slammed after blaming Elizabeth Edwards for affair David Edwards and Nick Juliano
Published : Thursday August 14 , 2008
Add this to the litany of shocking and offensive things to have emerged from right - wing radio host Rush Limbaugh 's mouth : " It just seems to me that [ John ]
Edwards might be attracted to a woman whose mouth did something other than talk . "
The popular conservative seemed quite clearly to be blaming Edwards 's wife , Elizabeth , who is battling breast cancer , with driving her husband to another woman .
Earlier in his nationally syndicated show Tuesday , Limbaugh launched into an extended diatribe on how Elizabeth was " smarter than John Edwards " and implied she was dictating his actions .

Ann Coulter had to chime in , and as usual , her comments are easily unmasked to demonstrate that anything the left does is horrific , while business as usual in Washington , even though it means trampling our constitution and Bill of Rights , is a non-story :
Even By Trial Lawyer Standards , Edwards A Real Sleazebag 08/13/2008
The good news : DNA testing has confirmed that John Edwards is not the father of Rielle Hunter 's baby .
The bad news :
The father is Bill Clinton .
Ha ha -- just kidding !
It 's almost impossible to get pregnant by having the type of sex Bill Clinton prefers .

We 've seen a liberal church shot - up because of the barrage of hate literature the shooter had accumulated .
To imply it did n't help to set off his killing spree is absurd .
Now , today we witnessed the Democratic Chairman in Arkansas , Bill Gwatney , being assassinated by an individual who might have shot Mr. Gwatney because " he lost his job . "
From the President on down , the GOP is blaming the Democrats for the country 's economic woes , when it 's really the failed economic policies of George W. Bush , something the right - wing refuses to admit .
They would rather play the blame game without a shred of evidence or anything else that will back - up their lies and misinformation .
Are we facing a situation where it 's going to be open season on Liberals and Democrats ?
People are losing their homes by the droves , they 're losing their jobs , and through all of this , Limbaugh , Coulter , Hannity , and O'Reilly are barraging those who are already suffering and offering up Liberals and Democrats as the villains , even to the point where they offer to " buy ammo " ( Michael Reagan ) for those who choose violence because their world is collapsing around them .
Throughout the United States , Liberals and Democrats are being portrayed as those who are responsible for our economic collapse .
And it 's being done with extreme malice and intimidation tactics .

An Edinburgh father who bought a website domain name for his son is facing a battle with the estate of Chronicles of Narnia author CS Lewis .
Richard Saville - Smith paid £ 70 for the name www.narnia.mobi so his son Comrie , 10 , who is a CS Lewis fan , could use it for his e-mail address .
But now CS Lewis ( Pte ) wants the name for itself .
A complaint has been lodged with the World Intellectual Property Organization .
Mr Saville - Smith 's wife Gillian , who is a poet , said : " We were saving it as a surprise for our little boy 's birthday - to coincide with the release of the new Narnia film - so that he could have one of the coolest e-mail addresses in the world .
" Our whole family are great admirers of CS Lewis and he must be turning in his grave about all this . "
Commercial gain
In 2006 , companies had a three - month period to express interest in .mobi website names before they were made more widely available .
The couple bought the Narnia name , along with a number of others " just for fun " , including TheQueen.mobi and USPresident.mobi .
Domain name disputes focus partly on whether a " cybersquatter " is using the site for commercial gain , and whether trademarks are involved , according to legal website weblaw.co.uk .
Mr Saville - Smith said he has done nothing at all with the site and has not made " a cent " .
In 2005 , the bank Citigroup successfully got the name www.citigroup.co.uk back from Jim Davies .
He had bought the name under his company Global Projects Management and received e-mails which were sent to citigroup .

I was humbled by many of the winners at the Index on Censorship awards for freedom of expression last night .
But I was especially struck by the comments of Julian Assange of Wikileaks , the phenomenally successful whistleblowing site .
In particular he mentioned the importance of the unfashionable concept of syndicalism ( for most people it seems Trade Unions are so last century ) which had helped Wikileaks survive legal attacks in the US .
His words truly warmed my heart .
More worrying was the news that the Guardian / Observer has been forced to pull down six articles about Nadhmi Auchi , the Iraqi businessman convicted of fraud in France in 2003 .
Auchi has been on the warpath since his name was connected with Tony Rezko , the Illinois fundraiser currently on trial in America , who was one of Barack Obama 's earliest backers .
In the UK , The Times has been pursuing the story with impressive tenacity .
The articles are still available in various places on the web but it 's probably wise not to link to them from here !

Some of the world ’s rarest and most precious metals , including platinum and iridium , could owe their presence in the Earth ’s crust to iron and stony - iron meteorites , fragments of a large number of asteroids that underwent significant geological processing in the early Solar System .
Dr Gerhard Schmidt from the University of Mainz , Germany , has calculated that about 160 metallic asteroids of about 20 kilometres in diameter would be sufficient to provide the concentrations of these metals , known as Highly Siderophile Elements ( HSE ) , found in the Earth ’s crust .
Dr Schmidt will be presenting his findings at the European Planetary Science Congress in Münster on Monday 22nd September .
Siderophile ( iron - loving ) elements are a group of high - density transition metals that tend to bond with metallic iron in the solid or molten state .
The HSE group includes rhenium ( Re ) , osmium Os ) , iridium ( Ir ) , ruthenium ( Ru ) , rhodium ( Rh ) , platinum ( Pt ) , palladium ( Pd ) and gold ( Au ) .
Artist rendition provides image of asteroid Kleopatra , a type of asteroid that a future mission could target for further study of the solar system .
Dr Schmidt said , “ A key issue for understanding the origin of planets is the knowledge of the abundances of HSE in the crust and mantle of the Earth , Mars and the Moon .
We have found remarkably uniform abundance distributions of HSE in our samples of the Earth ’s upper crust .
A comparison of these HSE values with meteorites strongly suggests that they have a cosmochemical source . ”
During a 12 - year study , Dr Schmidt and colleagues have analysed the concentrations of HSE at meteorite impact sites around the world , as well as in the samples from the Earth ’s mantle and crust .
In addition , he has compared the data from the Earth with data from impact breccias from the Moon brought by the Apollo missions and Martian meteorites , believed to be samples from the mantle and crust on Mars .
Although HSE were present in the nebula from which the Earth formed , as the young planet evolved and heated up they were stripped , along with other heavy elements , from the silicate mantle into the iron and nickel - rich metallic core .
The presence of HSE in the mantle is still a matter of debate .
However , a widely accepted theory is that HSE were added by meteorite impacts as a veneer of material over the Earth ’s surface after the core had formed , about 20 - 30 million years after the planet ’s accretion .
This could have been by the collision with a Mars - sized impactor that led to the formation of the Moon .
Different classes of meteorites have characteristic elemental ratios of HSE that give indications where in the Solar System they formed .
However , the characteristic ratios of HSEs in the Earth ’s upper mantle ( for example the ruthenium / iridium element ratio of about 2 ) match up with theoretical predictions for asteroids formed in the Mercury - Venus region .
The Earth is a differentiated body , with a iron - nickel core , a silicate mantle , and evolved silicate crust .
Dr Schmidt ’s study shows that the abundance ratios of HSE in the Earth ’s crust are much higher than those found in stony meteorites , known as chondrites , which represent the pristine material from the early Solar System .
The ratios of HSE found in the crust bear a much closer resemblance to iron or stony - iron meteorites .
These are fragments of larger asteroids that have had enough internal heat in the past to form a molten metal core .
The HSE concentrate preferentially in the liquid core and at the boundary with the solid , rocky envelope .
However , the exact ratios of the different metals depend on the physical conditions under which they were formed .
The ratios of HSE found in the Earth ’s upper mantle do not exactly match any specimens of meteorites found in collections around the world .
Close to the mantle highly siderophile element ratios are data from the iron meteorite Charlotte .
To date , about 20 iron meteorites and about 20 stony meteorites , called chondrites , have been identified as projectiles of the 175 known impact craters on Earth .
The projectiles for the other 135 impact craters on Earth are still unknown .
No meteorites have been identified as being formed in the region between Mercury and Venus .
Intriguingly , some of the Martian meteorites which are probably most representative of the Martian crust also have HSE values that resemble groups of iron meteorites and stony irons , suggesting that a similar process took place on Mars .
Dr Schmidt said “ The first meteorite to be found on Mars was an iron meteorite , discovered by the Opportunity rover in January 2005 .
Analysis of the Nahkla , Shergotty and Zagami Martian meteorites strongly supports a genetic link with certain iron meteorites and pallasites . ”
Mozilla has officially announced the availability of the second Firefox 3.1 alpha .
This release includes support for the highly - anticipated HTML 5 " video " element and a handful of other features that move the browser forward .
Mozilla has been planning the 3.1 roadmap since before the launch of Firefox 3 .
Version 3.1 is expected to provide a strong incremental improvement and will include many of the features that were deferred for various reasons during the 3.0 development cycle .
The developers are refining the user interface for tabs and tagging and are also working on on important backend improvements to boost compatibility with emerging web standards like CSS 3 and HTML 5 .
The latest alpha — codenamed Shiretoko — includes support for the new video element , one of the most highly - anticipated features of HTML 5 .
We first looked at the video element in Firefox last year when a developer produced a preliminary implementation .
At the time , the feature was highly experimental and could only be tested in a specially - patched build .
The feature did n't make into the main tree in time for Firefox 3 , but now it 's a high priority feature for the 3.1 release .
The HTML 5 video element offers some unique capabilities that can't presently be achieved with Flash - based video players .
For instance , it enables web developers to more seamlessly intersperse video with other web content , manipulate video playback with JavaScript , and access video elements directly through the document object model ( DOM ) .
One of the most compelling demos shows translucent videos playing inside of SVG frames that a user can drag and resize .
The demo is implemented entirely using standards - based web technologies and shows how web developers could soon deliver rich interactive video content without Flash .
Another significant feature that landed in this alpha release is support for web worker threads , a new scripting capability that allows computationally intensive JavaScript to be run in the background so that it does n't cause the Firefox user interface to hang .
This feature and the significant JavaScript performance boost brought by the new TraceMonkey engine ( which is still under development is n't included in alpha 2 ) will give developers the ability to leverage client - side processing to create web applications of unprecedented sophistication .
Other , minor features were added in alpha 2 as well , including much - improved support for dragging tabs between windows .
Dragging a tab from one window to another in alpha 2 will no longer cause the page to reload .
This means that users can seamlessly move tabs between windows without disrupting page state or the contents of web forms .
Firefox 3.1 is shaping up to be an impressive release .
The latest features in alpha 2 build on the intriguing user interface changes and visual tab switcher that were added in the previous alpha .
Users can download the new version from the Mozilla web site .
Mr. Biden supported the 2002 Iraq war resolution and thus is at odds with Mr. Obama , who opposed the war from the start and has made his judgment on the question a centerpiece of his campaign .
But Mr. Biden tempered his support for the conflict by saying it should be limited to ending Iraq ’s weapons programs , and he has been a sharp and persistent critic of the war ’s conduct .
Last year , he said giving the Bush administration the authority to wage war was a mistake .
“ I regret my vote , ” he told Politico , the politics Web site .
“ The president did not level with us . ”
Mr. Biden ’s appeal as a national candidate is suspect .
His first bid for the presidency , beginning in 1987 , famously flamed out after he was caught stealing passages from a speech by Neil Kinnock , the leader of the Labor Party in Britain at the time .
His 2008 campaign never really got off the ground , little noticed in a field of well - financed candidates .
He finished fifth in the Iowa caucuses , edging out “ uncommitted . ”
He promptly dropped out and , diplomatically , declined to take sides in the slugfest between his Senate colleagues Mr. Obama and Hillary Rodham Clinton .
After the primaries ended , he enthusiastically endorsed Mr. Obama , though Mr. Biden had offended many around Mr. Obama early in 2007 by describing him as “ the first mainstream African - American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice - looking guy . ”
If there were any hard feelings , they appear to have been forgotten .
Mr. Biden , normally among the most accessible of senators , declined to be interviewed for this article .
Despite his poor showing in the presidential race , Mr. Biden was generally thought to have acquitted himself well .
His debate performances were uncharacteristically crisp , and he delivered two of the more memorable lines of the campaign .
Asked in an April 2007 debate whether he had the self - discipline to lead the free world , Mr. Biden answered , “ Yes . ”
When men and women take personality tests , some of the old Mars - Venus stereotypes keep reappearing .
On average , women are more cooperative , nurturing , cautious and emotionally responsive .
Men tend to be more competitive , assertive , reckless and emotionally flat .
Clear differences appear in early childhood and never disappear .
What ’s not clear is the origin of these differences .
Evolutionary psychologists contend that these are innate traits inherited from ancient hunters and gatherers .
Another school of psychologists asserts that both sexes ’ personalities have been shaped by traditional social roles , and that personality differences will shrink as women spend less time nurturing children and more time in jobs outside the home .
To test these hypotheses , a series of research teams have repeatedly analyzed personality tests taken by men and women in more than 60 countries around the world .
For evolutionary psychologists , the bad news is that the size of the gender gap in personality varies among cultures .
For social - role psychologists , the bad news is that the variation is going in the wrong direction .
It looks as if personality differences between men and women are smaller in traditional cultures like India ’s or Zimbabwe ’s than in the Netherlands or the United States .
A husband and a stay - at - home wife in a patriarchal Botswanan clan seem to be more alike than a working couple in Denmark or France .
The more Venus and Mars have equal rights and similar jobs , the more their personalities seem to diverge .
These findings are so counterintuitive that some researchers have argued they must be because of cross-cultural problems with the personality tests .
But after crunching new data from 40,000 men and women on six continents , David P. Schmitt and his colleagues conclude that the trends are real .
Dr. Schmitt , a psychologist at Bradley University in Illinois and the director of the International Sexuality Description Project , suggests that as wealthy modern societies level external barriers between women and men , some ancient internal differences are being revived .
The California Public Utilities Commission voted unanimously Thursday to oppose Proposition 7 , the Solar and Clean Energy Act of 2008 , a ballot measure that would order California utilities to procure half of their power from renewable resources by 2025 .
Some California pundits also refer to Proposition as “ Big Solar . ”
The CPUC is opposed to the measure primarily because “ it would establish an excessively rigid , and potentially unworkable , structure for the further development of renewable energy in California , ” the agency said in a press release .
The CPUC said that the structure of the measure might in the short term hinder the state ’s aggressive renewable energy goals by interfering with programs already under way .
Supporters of the measure argue that it would make California the world leader in clean power technology and help create over 370,000 new high wage jobs .
Opponents argue that the good intentions of the proposition are overshadowed by how poorly written the document is , and that the ambiguities created by its passage would undoubtedly precipitate a raft of unintended consequences .
In a very aggressive move ( one that may ultimately doom the ballot proposal ) , the measure would also make municipal utilities comply with the same renewable portfolio standards that apply to the investor - owned utilities .
A poll released on July 22 , 2008 showed Proposition 7 had relatively strong support amongst Californians , with 63 % supporting it and 24 % opposing it ( 82 % of those surveyed had no initial awareness of Proposition 7 ) .
But the future passage of the ballot measure now remains very much in question .
As of early August , the state ’s three investor owned utilities – PG&E Corp. , Southern California Edison , and Sempra , the parent of San Diego Gas & Electric – had pitched - in more than $ 23 million to defeat the measure , including $ 12.9 million from PG&E .
Registered voters in California will have the opportunity to vote on the ballot proposal in the upcoming November 4 election .

WASHINGTON 
An internal Justice Department investigation concluded Monday that political pressure drove the firings of several federal prosecutors in a 2006 purge , but said that the refusal of major players at the White House and the department to cooperate in the year - long inquiry produced significant “ gaps ” in its understanding of the events .
At the urging of the investigators , who said they did not have enough evidence to justify recommending criminal charges in the case , Attorney General Michael B. Mukasey appointed the Acting United States Attorney in Connecticut , Nora Dannehy , to continue the inquiry and determine whether anyone should be prosecuted .
The 356 - page report , prepared by the department ’s inspector general and its Office of Professional Responsibility , provides the fullest picture to date of an episode that opened the Bush administration up to charges of politicizing the justice system .
The firings of nine federal prosecutors , and the Congressional hearings they generated , ultimately led to the resignation of Attorney General Alberto Gonzales last September .
The investigation , which uncovered White House e-mail messages not previously made public , offered a blistering critique of Mr. Gonzales ’s management of the department .
It called Mr. Gonzales “ remarkably unengaged ” in overseeing an unprecedented personnel review , and said that he “ abdicated ” his administrative responsibilities , leaving those duties to his chief of staff .
It said that the process for deciding which prosecutors were fired was “ fundamentally flawed . ”
Palin 's ex-in - law speaks out .
Here is a preview of tonight 's AC360° report :
Drew Griffin
CNN Investigative Reporter
The Alaska state trooper at the center of a probe into whether Gov. Sarah Palin abused her power says he has " made mistakes , and I 've learned from those mistakes . "
But in an exclusive interview with us , Mike Wooten , Palin 's former brother - in - law , also denies some of the biggest allegations against him .
Wooten says he has been offered $ 30,000 to tell his story to a tabloid .
The Obama campaign has reached out to the head of his union .
And he no longer answers any phone number he does n’t recognize for fear it is another pesky reporter who wants his story .
The story is how he married into , then divorced out of , Alaska ’s first family .
The trooper finds his life at the center of the one and only potential scandal I can find concerning Gov. Palin , John McCain 's choice for running mate .
The scandalous allegation is the governor used her power to try and get her sister ’s ex fired .
When that did n’t work , it 's alleged Gov. Palin fired the public safety commissioner .
In our interview , Wooten rattled off a disturbing number of “ mistakes ” he ’s made in his career .
He admits tasering his stepson , illegally killing a moose and admits to multiple reprimands in his file .
A state trooper investigation even found credible evidence he was drinking in his patrol car .
But please tell me if you think his tale - dubbed Troopergate by Gov. Palin ’s political enemies - is really the scandal that will bring down the newest star on the political scene .
By the way , I hear Gov. Palin is in Florida .

Are your raw almonds actually fumigated or steamed ?
Over a year ago , the USDA implemented regulations requiring treatment for almonds , alleging that it was a necessary food safety requirement .
Two outbreaks of salmonella traced to almonds were reported in the last ten years , one traced to a 9000 acre nut farm , and the Almond Board of California supported the USDA ’s decision .
From the Cornucopia Institute :
A group of fifteen American almond growers and wholesale nut handlers filed a lawsuit in the Washington , D.C. federal court on Tuesday , September 9 seeking to repeal a controversial USDA - mandated treatment program for California - grown raw almonds .
“ The USDA ’s raw almond treatment mandate has been economically devastating to many family - scale and organic almond farmers in California , ” said Will Fantle , the research director for the Wisconsin - based Cornucopia Institute .
The USDA requires that raw almonds be treated with propylene oxide ( a toxic fumigant recognized as a carcinogen by the EPA ) or steam - heated before sale to American consumers .
Foreign - grown almonds are exempt and are rapidly displacing raw domestic nuts on the market .
Almonds treated with propylene oxide or steam heat can still be labeled as “ raw ” .
This is extremely misleading for consumers looking for raw food choices .
Stores are not required to alert consumers of the treatments , and vegans who eat a lot of nuts in their diet are outraged .
The Cornucopia Institute is helping to support this lawsuit :

We ’re picking up the pace in the second episode of Gorilla Jam where we take a look at the makings of a D&D character .
Each time we ’re moving closer and closer to roleplaying heaven , but before we get there , it ’s time to have a little taste of the crunchy D&D cereal bar … remember kids , crunch well to grow up into your paragon years !
This time we tackle the second chapter of the book and have a look at “ Making Characters . ”
Although it should be more accurately named something like “ How to Begin the Long and Wonderful Process of Making Characters ” I support Wizards of the Coast decision for a shorter and cleaner title .
But enough of my rambling , let ’s get ready for … eh , more of my rambling !
Introduction
In case you have just stumbled upon ( no pun intended ) this post , here is the idea and some ground rules .
I ’ll be reading all the core rulebooks for the newest edition of Dungeons and Dragons ( that ’s 4th Edition ) and I ’ll share with you my thoughts and experiences as I go through the tomes .
Also included will be solo play , group play and even ( provided I get some friendly gamers ) running the game myself .
After all this debacle I ’ll be doing some “ house ruling ” on the lovely lad to see if we can move away from the cool tactical minis game .
Once again , this is not a “ D&D is bad ” kind of series and although you will see personal comments that might not be flattering that just reflects my thoughts at the time of the reading .
One last thing , the links for all the articles in the series will always be found in the original topic to make sure that you do n’t miss any episode .
Have fun !
Player ’s Handbook
Chapter 2 : Making Characters
Alright !
Let ’s tackle the second chapter of the book where we will hopefully start making our own characters …
Notice all the joy and excitement ?
All the willingness to play along ?
Well that ’s me alright , and I ’m about to crash into a schizophrenic book .
Let ’s see if you can pinpoint the differences , I ’ll even give you a little help :
Your first step in playing D&D is to imagine and then create a character of your own .
Chapter 2 | Page 12
You choose a race ( … ) , a class ( … ) , and distinct powers such as magic spells or divine prayers .
Then you invent a personality , description , and story for your character .
Chapter 2 | Page 12
No ?
Nothing ?
Must be me then , let ’s move along .
In any case , it ’s pretty much the standard fare for the first pages so there ’s nothing that we have n’t seen before ( well , that ’s just for people who have played an RPG before … if you have n’t then let me assure you that what the book is saying is not in any way groundbreaking ) although I assume it gets the job done .
Well … that ’s not entirely true .
I have some reservations with things like this …
Throughout this book , we use the word “ you ” interchangeably with “ your character . ”
As far as the rules of the game are concerned , your character is you .
Chapter 2 | Page 12
The second sentence is what I ’m interested in .
You see , it might just be my personal history coming to haunt me , but I ’ve been basically screwed when playing D&D before by DMs that were n’t too clear on the fact that I am not my character and specifically that player knowledge is not the same as character knowledge .
Not only me though , I ’ve seen it with tons of people .
What I ’m talking about is the situation where your “ tactical genius ” makes mistakes that even a newbie Age of Empires player would laugh at , or when your smooth and cool con man ( as in confidence man - as far as I know - ) basically fumbles every social interaction just because the player is shy or not good with words .
For you planning on running a game , a word of advice : DON ’T DO THAT !
By the way , I do get that the book is putting a little weight in the “ Think of the hero you ’d want your character to be ( … ) ” and tries to reassure the player that the game statistics are only there to frame that character .
However , in the last game a friend run ( heavily inspired in D&D - mostly the same but with a home brewed world - ) one of the players wanted to be a tinkerer ( some sort of inventor ) , a resourceful guy that was all wits and “ none of that hokus pokus stuff ” and that did n’t know the pointy end of a sword .
Now , believe it or not , it ended up being a great adventure type character ( as far as I ’m told ) …
I just want to know what class you ’d have told the guy to play in D&D .
So get it straight game , if you need to select race and class first then do n’t pretend you can do whatever you want … just tell me that I can do whatever I want , within certain precise limits , and it ’s freaking Christmas alright ?
Ah !
I was expecting this part … I ’ll let the game spell it for me .
Your choice of character class also determines your character ’s role — the job your character does when the adventuring party is in a fight .
You should pick the race and class combination that interests you the most .
However , sometimes it ’s a good idea to first consider the role you want your character to fill .
For example , if you join an existing game and none of the other players are playing a character in the defender role , you would help them out by playing a fighter or a paladin .
Chapter 2 | Page 14
I bet you thought I was going to criticize that , but I ’m not going to .
I mean the game is for once getting its facts straight and making some sense .
Good for you game !
If you were always about killing stuff and tactical battles ( you can make a comment to flame me now ) it was about time you put your foot on top of it .
That does n’t mean that I like that , but now it ’s just a matter of personal choice , nothing wrong with my monkey friend here ( I ’m being so sweet I disgust myself . )
Next we have a short description of races which clumsily mixes biological features with societal characteristics ( but then again , D&D has always done this . )
We have 2 different kind of elves now ( well technically we have Eladrin and Elves but you get the picture ) and , of course , the ever popular “ inter - species breeding ” poster boys , the Half - Elves .
The rest of the cast is what you would expect although I can’t find the Gnomes anywhere ( edit : I am told that they ’re not in this edition … and that I live inside a freaking bubble ) and we have the Tieflings ( demon thingies ) but apparently no Aasimar ( angel thingies ? )
The classes descriptions ( I ’m on page 15 by the way ) are … lacking .
Let ’s have a look at the cleric .
Cleric : Courageous and devout , clerics are holy warriors and healers (…) Chapter 2 | Page 14
Alright , so we ’ll be struggling to keep the faith in times of despair and deal with the loss of hope on our community as the savage world creeps marauding fangs into … oh sorry , I forgot the rest of the description .
(…)
If you want to blast foes with divine powers , bolster your companions with healing and magical power , and lead them to victory with your wisdom and determination , play a cleric .
Chapter 2 | Page 14
Ahem … so let me rectify what I ’ve said .
Alright !
It ’s time to blast the opposition with shiny disco balls !
Sorry , for a moment there I got into the wrong genre .
The ‘ real ’ class descriptions will come later ( in the classes chapter ) so I ’ll just take this as an appetizer .
It does a good job of enticing you to play the kind of character you ’d enjoy most in combat … which apparently we will be doing lots of .
If you think about it , this is another point for the game as it ’s being rather clear with it .
Role
We go on to talk about role , and if you ’re going to play this game you better pay attention .
It ’s both an interesting and efficient concept to use ( in a tactical minis game . )
The idea is that depending on what class you ’ve chosen , you not only get your own way to kill stuff , but you get the role that you ’re expected to take ( and are more proficient at ) in combat .
This includes the defender ( tank and aggro managing ) , the leader ( buffer and party support ) , the striker ( most damage per second - or dps - ) and the controller ( area nuker but with emphasis on status effects ) role , and they are one of the fundamental axis for the tactical element in battles .
The description between parenthesis is for our more MMORPG crowd .
Now if I were bitter ( but I ’m not ) , I would raise the proverbial eyebrow at having this character -> class -> role thing so hardcoded into the roleplaying game .
But since I ’m not bitter , I wo n’t .
On different matters , the distinction between at - will , encounter and daily powers really seems interesting from a narrative point of view .
It emulates ( or I guess it will emulate , or maybe I wish it will emulate ) that movie / book feel that has the sorcerer casting his most terribly dreadful spell at the crucial moment ( instead of blasting crates with it at every turn ) and the warrior summoning all his prowess for that one last ditch effort that suddenly multiplies his ability and manages to overcome those apparently impossible odds .
I mean , we ’ve seen those everywhere and they generally work pretty well … it ’s pretty much a staple of action anime series for crying out loud .
The next section details the attributes in a very … D&D way .
Pretty much it tells you what each one means and when you ’ll be using it , as well as telling you which classes use which attributes the most .
Also , Strength is still the most relevant thing when it comes to how well you handle a stick .
We also have the concept of defenses , which pretty much does away with the old saving throws by providing a passive number for attacks or situations to beat ( and hopefully streamlines the dicerolling a bit . )
They also do seem to be trying to get rid of the “ monk problem ” ; I ’m talking about needing to have a lot of high attributes to be effective ( which apparently was endemic to the old monk class ) , so that ’s something right ?
As far as mechanics go , I ’m not a math genius so you will probably excuse me if I do n’t find everyone of them absolutely appealing or appaling .
I ’m going to read them ( of course ) but I wo n’t be commenting on them except if something comes up and bites my behind .
So for generating scores I will only say this :
Method 1 : The super duper man .
Method 2 : Why are there odd numbers again ?
I mean , they do n’t count for anything and the system might as well be calling you stupid if you set your ability score to one .
Method 3 : Some people like this , however …
If the total of your ability modifiers is lower than +4 or higher than +8 before racial ability adjustments , your DM might rule that your character is too weak or too strong compared to the other characters in the group and decide to adjust your scores to fit better within his or her campaign preferences .
Chapter 2 | Page 18
Why the heck am I rolling the scores anyways if I can’t have a character that sucks or that is a typical “ L337 dUD3 7 | - | 47 0wnz j00 Z ” ( elite dude that owns you ) ?
Kodak Moments !
We get to a juicy part here !
The DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game is , first and foremost , a roleplaying game (…) Chapter 2 | Page 18
Yeah !
Rock on book !
Jaden the 4th - level human fighter is a perfectly playable character even without any embellishment , but Jaden the Grim ’s personality — brooding , fatalistic , and honest — suggests a particular approach to negotiating with NPCs or discussing issues with the other characters .
A well - crafted character personality expands your experience of the game dramatically .
Chapter 2 | Page 18
I believe I ’m going to start naming these things as the FUB moments .
Those little pieces of heaven when you ca n’t help but saying “ Fuck you book … ” I mean , how hard is it for you to make up your mind ?
Are you “ first and foremost , a roleplaying game ” or just a tactical game where you can slap some roleplaying icing on top to “ expand your experience of the game “ ?
Make up your mind or get an editor .
Then there ’s alignments …
I do n’t even know by now .
I ’ve had so many problems and discussions regarding alignments in the past editions that I ’m just happy that I can go unaligned and develop a personality during play and then decide if that fits any of the other molds .
What I can say is that the alignments provided should have a more practical approach to them and give a set of things that good / evil and lawful / chaotic aligned beings will certainly do and will absolutely avoid .
I think the text gives you an idea but there ’s a lot of precision missing there ( and maybe it ’s on purpose . )
We ’re getting into god ’s territory here at page 20 .
Each deity has a vision of how the world should be , and the agents of the deities seek to bring that vision to life in the world .
Chapter 2 | Page 20
Then I think it would have been a good idea for you to have more than one paragraph and 3 bullet points as your description for each deity .
Just a thought though .
The game has little gems like this one right here :
Your character needs only a few personality traits that you can use as roleplaying touchstones , key traits that you can focus on and that are fun to play .
Chapter 2 | Page 23
Good idea game , a text that touches upon that is sitting on my computer as an unfinished “ Elements of Role - Playing Characters ” article .
The following sections are very good and provide some useful pointers and tips ( both for new players and for some veterans alike ) that could help anyone with fleshing and roleplaying a character .
They ’re not anything spectacular , but it ’s like when you go to see a movie you expect to be horrible ( not that this is the case ) and it has some very nice moments in it , you tend to really appreciate them .
In any case , there are a few moments where the book shoots itself in the foot …
Is your character tall , short , or in between ?
Solid and muscular , or lean and wiry ?
Male or female ?
Old or young ?
These decisions have no real impact on the game (…) Chapter 2 | Page 24
Thank you book , once again , for reminding me that you do n’t really care about this roleplaying stuff anymore than I care for learning grapple rules .
There ’s a big section on the different kind of checks that you can make .
It has examples and it ’s quite easy to read and follow , another point for you book .
As far as mechanics go , you know always have half your level ( rounded down , so half your level ups are completely irrelevant in this regard ) to your rolls so , you know , you get better at everything by leveling up .
I ’m still on the fence with this one , I think it works with the ‘ feel ’ that D&D is trying to give ( you get more badass all around when you get higher in levels . )
Dessert
Next ( page 27 ) we have the all time favorite !
Yes boys and girls it ’s gaining levels !
Some say we want it more than we want food and everyone agrees it ’s better than sex !
Alright , alright I ’m dropping the cute act .
It was just my way of kicking back after the game threw this roundhouse kick my way …
The game assumes that you ’ve been learning these powers in your spare time , studying musty tomes or practicing a complicated series of maneuvers .
Chapter 2 | Page 27
Well I guess , it would n’t make much sense if you do n’t assume those things , would it ?
In game terms , though , as soon as you gain a level , you can immediately use your new powers and feats .
Chapter 2 | Page 27
Roundhouse kick to realism and suspension of disbelief !
KO !
Flawless Victory !
Fatality !
D&D wins and he is probably pissing on your grave .
Another thing that surprised me is that you have a limit on how many of these powers you can use at once , or rather be active on your character at once .
Like , unless you ’re a human , you ca n’t have more than two ‘ at - will ’ powers and things like that .
It would seem to me that ( even though they could be compromised from lack of use ) there would be no apparent reason to limit yourself thus and certainly not a coherent reason within the setting .
So all I ’m left with is to think that this is some game balance tweak …
Any input on this is greatly appreciated .
Retraining is a godsend on the gameplay level , for me at least .
I ca n’t tell you how many times I felt ( playing D&D 3ed in an incorrect way I ’m sure ) that the game was practically laughing at me for choosing the wrong feat / gear / spell and so on .
At least you get to try some things out and change them if they ’re not your thing .
Of course what works on the gameplay level is pretty awkward on the narrative level … specially when we ’re talking about skills .
I ’m sure you can all flood me with ideas on how to make that work , but the fact that remains is that the book as is does n’t give a damn about that issue .
Finally , I kind of like the “ Three Tiers ” section .
It ’s very fluffy ( see , I put the word in here … happy now ? ) and it gives you a good idea of what you can expect from the game as well as enticing you ( if you ’re into that thing ) to crave for more and more MMO … I mean D&D goodness .
Intermission
So , how do you like this so far ?
I ’m sure I ’ve missed a lot of points , especially on the mechanics part .
I ’m not really DA MAN to be evaluating the game on that front so if you have any ideas or tips , or maybe your own opinion of the game , go ahead and comment on the article .
All comments are welcomed whether you agree with me or whether you think I ’m a brainless Dodo bird heading for the cliffs .
I ’ll see you next time with the races chapter which ( this time it ’s true ) will probably be a shorter read .

The suicide truck blast injured 266 people , including 11 foreigners , according to Malik .

British Airways temporarily suspended its flights to Islamabad as a result of the security situation , according to an airline spokeswoman who did not want to be named .
A Sunday night flight has been canceled , and the airline is reviewing its operations for later in the week .
British Airways operates at least three flights a week to the Pakistani capital out of London 's Heathrow Airport .
At a news conference in Islamabad on Sunday , Pakistani authorities released security video of the blast , showing a small explosion inside the truck before the larger , deadly explosion .
Watch the truck bomb caught on tape
In the video , a large truck crashes into the security gate , sending one security officer scurrying for safety .
Then , as security guards approach the truck , the top of the vehicle explodes and the security guards flee .
A small cloud of smoke appears above the truck , which is engulfed in flames minutes later .
One of the security guards tries to put out the fire with a hand - held extinguisher , to no avail .
The guards then walk away , and the camera freezes on the burning truck .
Pakistani officials said the blast apparently disrupted electricity to the area , causing the closed - circuit television camera to malfunction .
No arrests have been made in connection with the attack , Malik said Sunday , adding that militants in Pakistan 's tribal regions are suspected of orchestrating the attack .
" I am not in a position to tell you who has done it , but [ in ] all the previous investigations , all the roads have gone to South Waziristan , " he said .
South Waziristan is one of Pakistan 's seven tribal areas where Taliban and al Qaeda militants are active .
At the bombing site , video showed a deep crater in the pavement where the bomb detonated .
More than a dozen cars were reduced to twisted steel .
The crater was 24 feet deep and nearly 60 feet wide , Malik said .
The blast also caused a natural gas leak that set the top floor of the five - story , 258 - room hotel on fire , police said .
The blaze quickly engulfed the entire structure .

Most of the fatalities appeared to be drivers , who were waiting with their cars outside the Marriott , and hotel security guards , Geo TV's Hamid Mir said .
The hotel , where a standard room costs more than $ 300 per night , is near the compound that contains the Parliament building , the prime minister 's house , the Supreme Court and the presidency .
The blast occurred about 7:50 p.m. , after the breaking of the fast during the holy month of Ramadan , Malik said .
Trees were felled by the explosion , which occurred hours after newly elected President Asif Ali Zardari addressed a joint session of Parliament and promised to root out terrorism .
Watch the scene the morning after the blast »
A few hours after the attack , Zardari addressed the nation on television , saying he knows the pain of terrorism after his wife , former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto , was killed in December on the campaign trail .
" My heart cries tears of blood .
I can understand your pain .
I want to ask you to turn this pain into your strength , " he said , describing extremism as " a cancer , which we will finish . "
" In the holy month of Ramadan , no Muslim can act in this way .
These people are not Muslims , " he said .
" I appeal to all democratic nations to help us get rid of this menace . "
The Marriott , a Western brand - name hotel , has been the site of attacks in the past .

Malik said authorities had received a threat against Parliament two days ago .
" We had taken all security measures , " he said .
" There was heavy security in the city . "
Located near the diplomatic section of the city and heavily guarded by police and the military , the hotel is popular among tourists and had been packed Saturday night .
Any vehicle entering the facility is searched , its underside checked for bombs , before it is allowed to pass through heavy steel gates .

The British High Commission in Islamabad said six British nationals -- five adults and one minor -- were injured in the attack , including three commission members .
A Pakistani staff member of the commission was also injured , it said .
A spokeswoman for the German Foreign Ministry said six Germans in the hotel were slightly hurt in the attack , and that all embassy personnel were accounted for .
CNN 's Zein Basravi and Reza Sayah , and journalist Tomas Etzler contributed to this report .

Needless to say there was plenty of buzz surrounding our , um , investigation into the possible hiring of USC Song Girls ( $ 150 / hr ) to liven up any party you might be throwing .
Now comes word that there is a cheaper alternative just up the road at UCLA .
Our investigative staff has uncovered documents that show you can hire a Bruins ’ cheerleaders for $ 100 per hour .
Do you want your guests to be impressed and remember your next gathering ?
Do not miss out on the opportunity to include the UCLA Spirit Squad in your event planning !
We have performed at a variety of events and we look forward to enhancing your next gathering !
Is this some sort of trick question .
Screw our guests .
We want to be impressed by the UCLA cheerleaders .
And at $ 100 per hour that is a steal compared to those overpriced chicks from the USC ‘ hood .
We ’re torn between the two squads .
Do we overpay for the more notorious Song Girls and hope they join us for a beer bong or two .
Or , do we go the cheaper route and save the extra cash for booze .

After some of the most turbulent trading days experienced by Wall Street in a generation , the latest list of America 's top 400 richest people produced by the business magazine Forbes looks like a window into a bygone world .
The Microsoft chairman , Bill Gates , still tops the list with a net worth of $ 57bn ( £ 31.7bn ) .
But how safe is the second - place position of the famous investor Warren Buffett - his $ 50 bn fortune has dropped $ 12bn in six months - since the list was compiled at close of play on August 29 ?
Since then the Dow Jones has dropped more than 800 points in just four days , Lehman Brothers became the world 's largest ever bankrupt , Merrill Lynch was forced into a shotgun wedding with Bank of America , AIG was bailed out by the US government and Morgan Stanley is on the brink of collapse .
AIG 's woes earlier in the year had already pushed one of the insurance group 's major shareholders , Eli Broad , down to No 48 on the list with an estimated wealth of $ 6.7 bn .
A well - known philanthropist , he sold his SunAmerica business to AIG and the proceeds have helped not only his adoptive city of Los Angeles but the nation 's art dealers .
He owns the world 's largest collection of works by Jeff Koons and once bought a painting by Roy Lichtenstein for $ 2.5 m using a credit card .
The government bailout of AIG , however , will have significantly hit his wallet since the Forbes 400 list was compiled .
It is unlikely that art will retain its value in the current slump , despite the record - breaking Damien Hirst sale earlier this week .
This will come as a shock to Donald and Doris Fisher , the founders of the Gap clothing chain who returned to the list in joint 377th place - on $ 1.3 bn - thanks to their $ 1bn art collection which includes pieces by Chuck Close , Richard Serra and Alexander Calder .
The couple share their spot with the former Citigroup boss Sandy Weill , who can also expect the recent turmoil to have hit the value of the shares in the bank he still owns - he had already lost $ 500 m over the year to the end of August .
The position of fellow Citigroup shareholder Gerald Ford - who sold Golden State Bankcorp in 2002 for $ 6bn to the bank , and is listed at No 355 with $ 1.4bn - also looks rocky .
Back among the big hitters , Wall Street 's crash and the demise of Lehman Brothers will have hit the $ 15 bn fortune of 15th - placed Abigail Johnson .
Her family runs Fidelity Investments , which is understood to have funds with some of the highest exposure to both the collapsed investment bank and AIG .
Her father Edward is placed at No 28 with $ 11bn and is level - pegging with George Soros .
Soros ranks highest among those in the Fortune 400 whose wealth comes from hedge funds and private equity and it is unlikely that all the other 23 in the list who have made their money the same way will be there in a year 's time .
The Bridgewater Associates boss , Ray Dalio , is ranked at No 78 with a fortune estimated at $ 4.5bn , while the Och - Ziff hedge fund co-founder Daniel Och is at No 95 on $ 3.9 bn .
Also at No 78 is John Paulson , who has made millions for his funds over the past year by betting against sub - prime assets .
The firm 's Credit Opportunities fund was up 590 % net of fees last year .
As well as wiping out billions in paper fortunes as share prices collapse , and perhaps raising billions more for shrewd investors , the impact of the turmoil in the banking sector is likely to hit other industries .
Particularly vulnerable is Michael Bloomberg , who sits in eighth position with a $ 20 bn fortune .
The collapses and mergers in the financial industry are likely to significantly reduce demand for the news and trading terminals that bear his name .
Elsewhere , Google 's Sergey Brin and Larry Page come in at 13 and 14 with $ 15.9bn and $ 15.8 bn respectively .
Lawrence ' Larry ' Ellison , the boss of the software company Oracle , comes in third at $ 27bn , while spaces four , five and six are taken up with the Wal - Mart dynasty who together control more than 39 % of the grocery chain , which owns Asda in the UK .
Jim Walton , the son of the supermarket giant 's pioneer Sam Walton , comes in fourth at $ 23.4bn ; his elder brother and the company 's chairman , Robson Walton is in fifth on $ 23.3bn , and their sister Alice is joint sixth with $ 23.2 bn with the widow of her other brother John , Christy Walton , and her family .
Finally , the Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg can afford a wry smile .
He is the youngest member of the Forbes 400 thanks to the $ 15bn valuation placed on the social networking site when Microsoft took its 1.6 % stake last year .
His $ 1.5 bn fortune puts him at number 321 .
At the time he was being pushed to float the business , which he set up four years ago .
If he had , it would now be buffeted by the current market turmoil and it is unlikely he would have the minimum $ 1.3 bn fortune needed for inclusion .

Maurice Sendak ’s 80th year — which ended with his birthday earlier this summer and is being celebrated on Monday night with a benefit at the 92nd Street Y — was a tough one .
He has been gripped by grief since the death of his longtime partner ; a recent triple - bypass has temporarily left him too weak to work or take long walks with his dog ; and he is plagued by Norman Rockwell .
Or , to be more accurate , he is plagued by the question that has repeatedly been asked about Norman Rockwell : was he a great artist or a mere illustrator ?
“ Mere illustrator , ” he said , repeating the phrase with contempt .
It ’s not that Mr. Sendak , who has illustrated more than 100 books , including many he wrote , is angry that people question Rockwell ’s talent ; rather , he fears he has not risen above the “ mere illustrator ” label himself .
Never mind that Mr. Sendak ’s originality and emotional honesty have changed the shape of children ’s literature ; that his work is featured in museums ; that he has designed costumes and sets for operas , ballets and theater ; that he has won a chest full of awards and prizes including a National Medal of the Arts .
As the playwright Tony Kushner , one of his collaborators , said , “ He ’s one of the most important , if not the most important , writers and artists ever to work in children ’s literature .
In fact , he ’s a significant writer and artist in literature .
Period . ”
I 'm not going to defend the fact freelance photographer Jill Greenberg deceived John McCain , embarrassed her client , The Atlantic , and potentially damaged her burgeoning freelance career .
Beyond the drama -- BAGnewsNotes being primarily about the picture -- I find her subversive , up - lit portrait of Steve Schmidt 's client brimming with characterological truth .
( click for full size )
( For a more detailed background on how Greenberg , after taking the cover shot , tricked McCain as to which way the light was coming from , and went on to do even more bad things , check out Rachel Hulin or PDN . )
In fact , I find a certain poetic justice to the episode .
The hiring of Greenberg , compelled not just on the basis of her background and experience but also her sometimes maverick artistry , offers parallels to the GOP 's hiring of candidate McCain as its nominee .
McCain promised one thing -- a different kind of campaign , one with integrity , one with candor , one with access -- and then delivered something else .
Greenberg actually trumps him , because she did deliver a cover shot that The Atlantic was perfectly happy with .
The thing is , she used deception to get the goods on McCain , as well .
In that regard , the Dr. Evil portrait -- beyond its blatantly unintimidated look at a not - so - friendly or nice McCain -- is also poetically perfect in the way the shooter and the subject , two otherwise widely accomplished and popular performers , are both revealed as characters of subterfuge .

1 . In Louisiana it is illegal to sell and arrange flowers without permission from the government .
Aspiring florists must pass a subjective licensing exam that is graded by existing florists , who have a direct incentive to keep new competitors from entering the market .
Thus the failure rate is higher than that of the Louisiana bar , which results in hundreds of well - qualified would - be entrepreneurs being denied the ability to work in their chosen profession .
No one can honestly believe that Louisiana ’s flower cartel is necessary to protect consumers from renegade flower sellers .
Rather , it is a classic case of protecting favored groups at the expense of consumers and entry - level entrepreneurs .
2. Mercedes Clemens was threatened with thousands of dollars in fines and criminal prosecution unless she stopped . . . massaging horses .
In Maryland two powerful groups decided to monopolize the growing field of animal massage by requiring all practitioners to spend four years in veterinary school -- where massage is not even taught .
Suggesting that only people with veterinary degrees are capable of massaging animals is like suggesting that only people with medical degrees are capable of massaging humans .
Preventing Clemens -- who is a licensed human - massage therapist and certified in equine massage -- from working in her chosen trade has absolutely nothing to do with consumer or animal safety and everything to do with the financial interests of the veterinary cartel .

Milton Friedman , in his book Capitalism and Freedom (
Occupational Licensure chapter
) , wrote " Licensure therefore frequently establishes essentially the medieval guild kind of regulation in which the state assigns power to the members of the profession .
In practice , the considerations taken into account in determining who shall get a license often involve matters that , so far as a layman can see , have no relation whatsoever to professional competence . "
With tremors continuing to shake Wall Street , John McCain began his campaign day standing by his guns , saying this to a crowd in Jacksonville , Fla . : " Our economy , I think , still , the fundamentals of our economy are strong . "
From a purely political standpoint , the week could not have started any better for Democratic strategists .
To be sure , McCain -- in his very next sentence in Jacksonville -- added that he recognized that " these are very , very difficult " times .
And at a second Florida event , in Orlando , he tweaked his comments , saying his confidence in the economy 's " fundamentals " referred to the productivity , innovation and skills of the American worker .
He also said , " The top of our economy is broken " -- something he promised to fix .
But McCain 's initial reprise of a line he uttered earlier this summer ( see below ) obviously gave Democrats a chance to focus the presidential campaign away from the low - bore squabbles of last week ( lipstick on pigs , anyone ? ) and back onto what they see as a stark divide between the two presidential candidates .
Barack Obama 's running mate , Joe Biden , wasted no time seeking to do that .
Campaigning in crucial Michigan , he told his audience : " I could walk from here to Lansing and I would n't run into a single person who thought the economy was doing well .
Unless I ran into John McCain . "
That 's not quite what McCain has been saying , of course , but his reiteration of his " fundamentals " line gave Democrats an opening they are going to try to drive a tank through .
-- Don Frederick
[ Update : Obama just took his expected whack at McCain during a rally in Grand Junction , Colo .
Rhetorically , he asked his audience why " today , of all days " McCain would make his comment about the economy 's fundamentals .
" Sen. McCain , what economy are you talking about ? " he said . ]
Evolution and creationism could both be examined , Prof Reiss said Professor Michael Reiss has quit as director of education at the Royal Society following the controversy over his recent comments on creationism .
Last week Prof Reiss - a Church of England minister - said creationism should be discussed in science lessons if pupils raised the issue .
He was criticised by other scientists - though misquoted as saying creationism should be " taught " in science classes .
The society said some of his comments had been " open to misinterpretation " .
This had damaged its reputation .
' Not scientific ' " As a result , Professor Reiss and the Royal Society have agreed that , in the best interests of the society , he will step down immediately as director of education - a part - time post he held on secondment , " it said in a statement .
" He is to return , full time , to his position as professor of science education at the Institute of Education . "
The Royal Society reiterated that its position was that creationism had no scientific basis and should not be part of the science curriculum .
" However , if a young person raises creationism in a science class , teachers should be in a position to explain why evolution is a sound scientific theory and why creationism is not , in any way , scientific . "
I believe the Royal Society should have supported him and used this opportunity to further a reasoned debate
Roland Jackson
British Association for the Advancement of Science
It added that the society greatly appreciated the efforts of Prof Reiss , a biologist , in furthering its work in the important field of science education over the past two years and wished him well for the future .
Creationists take a literal interpretation of the Bible 's description of the origin of life and reject the Darwinian concept of evolution .
Prof Reiss , speaking at the British Association Festival of Science at the University of Liverpool , estimated that about one in 10 children was from a family which supported a creationist rather than evolutionary viewpoint .
He said his experience had led him to believe it was more effective to include discussion about creationism alongside scientific theories such as the Big Bang and evolution - rather than simply giving the impression that such children were wrong .
Misconceptions
Reacting to his stepping down , Lord Robert Winston , professor of science and society at Imperial College London , said : " I fear that in this action the Royal Society may have only diminished itself .
" This is not a good day for the reputation of science or scientists .
" This individual was arguing that we should engage with and address public misconceptions about science - something that the Royal Society should applaud . "
Dr Roland Jackson , chief executive of the British Association for the Advancement of Science , said Prof Reiss 's departure was a " real loss " .
" I was at the actual discussion and what I heard him say , however it has been reported , was essentially the position advocated by the Royal Society , " he said .
Dr Jackson said the organisation " should have supported him and used this opportunity to further a reasoned debate " .
Professor Chris Higgins , vice - chancellor of the University of Durham , said : " There should be no room for doubt - creationism is completely unsupportable as a theory , and the only reason to mention creationism in schools is to enable teachers to demonstrate why the idea is scientific nonsense and has no basis in evidence or rational thought . "
Read a selection of your comments on this story :
At the beginning of the school year , pupils should be briefly told about creationism .
It should be pointed out that this is a RELIGIOUS concept and therefore should be taught in religious education only .
Only evolution should be taught in mainstream classes , to avoid confusion
Rita Elliott , Kingston / Jamaica
The persecution of this man - leading to his resignation -- is an embarrassing shame .
Have we become so biased ( or is it fear ? ) that we simply cannot discuss a dissenting opinion ?
Is that really the kind of society we want -- one where people are so afraid of persecution that they are unable to express their views ?
Shame on you !
S. Lee , USA
It is appalling that Professor Reiss has had to resign .
Just because these closed - minded scientists cannot prove creationism does n't mean it is n't a possibility .
Evolution has far from been proved either actually .
Interesting how the atheists are more intolerant than those they criticse .
What are they afraid of ?.....
Francesca Quine , London , UK
Yes , I think there should be open discussion about creationism alongside open discussions about evolution .
Otherwise it looks as though evolutionists are closed - minded and are afraid of something .
Kerina Jones , Swansea , Wales
It is sad to see a learned professor resign a post over a media whipped misinterpretation of his intent .
However , that seems to be the world we live in , with press readily willing to deliberately mis-represent people in order to create higher sales ( of papers ) or achieve higher viewing numbers .
I do find that objectionable .
If Creationism is raised in a Science class , it needs to be made plain that a Scientific Theory has far higher requirements than the definition of the word that merely states " conjecture on limited information " .
A Scientific theory needs to be presented in a fashion whereby it can be proved incorrect by experimentation .
Evolution is presented this way , Creationism is not .
Hence Evolution is Science , Creationism is faith .
Rich , Bristol Freedom of speech and belief are rapidly being destroyed in this country .
Evolutionists are free to peddle their godless , atheistic bias , and any considered concepts alien to their ' faith ' is shut out .
That a leading scientist is put into a position where he has to resign is astonishing .
Prof .
Higgins , in your report says " creationism is completely unsupportable as a theory ... "
Wrong .
There is considerable evidence that creationism is a valid theory .
But if one does not want to believe it , ' any port in storm will do . '
Pete Hodge , Skelmersdale , England
If you let the subject of creationism enter science classes , what next ?
Flat Earth , Geocentrism ?
When will there be time for real science ?
Mark , Malvern UK
It 's a shame that the Royal Society has decided that there should not even be any discussion of creationism in classrooms .
If a student brings the subject up , what else is to be done ?
The question can't be ignored , but should be explored in a reasonable manner .
There is plenty of evidence that can be brought to bear to support the theory of evolution , so why the fear of getting into that discussion ?
Is it , perhaps , that creationism is such a hot potato that the Society wants to distance itself from even the debate about it ?
Chris , Glenrothes , UK After studying biology and natural history for years , the strict biblical interpretation of The Creation leaves , to say the least , much to the imagination .
It is , however , my firm belief that a Superior Being started the whole thing going ( Big Bang ) .
How can nothing produce something ?
Guy Tremblay , Ottawa , Canada
I believe the discussion of creationism in the classroom to be a good thing - even if only to show how utterly preposterous the idea is .
Science should have consigned religion to the bin , but the capacity for the human mind to grasp on to superstitions and ancient dogma never ceases to amaze .
They say money is the root of all evil ; the facts say it is religion .
Tom Croft , Belfast I think creationism should be explained in class as a theory of what happened at the beginning of time .
After all , none of our imminent scientists were there at the " big bang " their 's is only an " educated " theory .
Both should stand side - by - side .
Julie , Warrington
Of course Professor Reiss should not have resigned , and there should most definitely be a discussion about creationism alongside scientific theories at schools .
Our children have to learn about all kinds of religious beliefs at school , whether their parents agree with those beliefs or not .
Children are not stupid .
If they ask questions , they deserve an answer .
If the only answer which can be given is that Creationism is " unscientific " then that is a very poor response , and totally diminishes the reputation of scientists .
Jeanette Stewart , Dingwall , Scotland Teaching creationism in schools , or even giving it a base as a real theory is akin to informing children that the earth is flat .
As the majority of rational thinking people will know , this is not the case !
Why people feel the need to justify their existence with what is essentially a made up story is beyond my comprehension .
There is enough false information to be found on the internet and on the television , so you would expect that the scientific community would strive to eradicate these archaic beliefs so that our children grow up rational and not tainted by religious fanaticism .
Instead , we see the leaders of the scientific education community suggesting that a story be debated as an alternative to a sound scientific theory .
Andy White , Weston - s- Mare , North Somerset
This is not a debate between creationism and evolutionary theory .
In fact , the debate is between creationism and the whole of science as we know it .
If the universe is less than 10,000 years old , then : all of geology and biology are wrong ; the speed of light has been wrongly calculated , so Einsteinian physics is wrong ; the distance and speed of other galaxies has been wrongly calculated , meaning that all of astronomy and therefore Newtonian physics are also wrong .
For informed people to challenge accepted scientific orthodoxy on the basis of proper evidence is always healthy , but to debunk the whole of science is another .
S. England , Cardiff
As a scientist , I am thoroughly ashamed of my own breed .
Professor Reiss ' comments were completely taken out of context .
Besides , religion is a very personal spiritual experience .
Are you telling me that there are no scientists out there ( or in the Royal Society for that matter ) who are n't Christians ?
The more pressing question is how do we acknowledge that both the creationism and Darwinism exist in the classroom , rather than ignore the issue .
We let the kids decide for themselves how they reconcile scientific facts and religion .
Michelle , Cambridge I am very disappointed with Prof. Reiss ' resignation and more for him than for criticism in itself .
We also know that evolutionism and creationism do n't exclude each other and this was a good reason to keep on discussing the subject within a scientific context
Giuseppe Ragazzoni , Florence , Italy
It is exactly because people do not understand what makes a science and what makes a pseudo - science ( like Creationism ) that are so many misconceptions surrounding scientific theories such as evolution .
The idea that creationism should be discussed if raised in a science lesson seems reasonable ; kids need to understand why it 's not a science .
For the majority , it would hopefully develop the critical thinking skills necessary for sifting though all the misconceptions we 're fed through life .
Why the Royal Society failed to support him I cannot understand .
Laura Morgan , Jersey , Channel Islands
That the director of education has been forced out of his post for his comments is ridiculous .
His only error was that he remained unclear by failing to state that when creationism is discussed , it should be in such a way as to show that it has no basis in science or truth & should therefore be dismissed .

NEW YORK ( MarketWatch ) -- U.S. stocks were slammed hard again on Wednesday , with the Dow Jones Industrial Average skidding to its lowest close since late 2005 , as tightening credit conditions intensified fears about further failures in the financial sector .

Scientists Invent Quantum Ball Lightning Energy Machine
Ball Lightning is one of the most mysterious phenomenons known to mankind .
There have been over 10,000 cases reported in history and nearly 5 % of American ’s have said they have witnessed it .
Until recently its source and composition have remained unknown but if scientists are successful it could be powering large scale reactors and could go a long way to solving America ’s energy needs .
Recent breakthroughs have been occurring at laboratories around the World including research being done in the joint study group at the Max - Planck - Institute and Berlin ’s Humboldt University .
Scientists have generated ball - lightning - like plasma clouds with luminous circular spirals at diameters of 10 to 20 centimeters , in these spirals a plasmoid of ionized gas or “ quantum nucleus ” have been observed , leaving scientists stunned at the potential energy gain given the relative size of the experiment .

Abstract
This paper critiques the proposed emergency legislation for spending $ 700 billion on purchasing financial firms ' troubled assets to address the 2008 financial crisis .
It also puts forward a superior alternative for advancing the two goals of the proposed legislation - restoring stability to the financial markets and protecting taxpayers .
I show that the proposed legislation can be redesigned to limit greatly the cost to taxpayers while doing much better in terms of restoring stability to the financial markets .
The proposed redesign is based on four interrelated elements :
* No overpaying for troubled assets :
The Treasury 's authority to purchase troubled assets should be limited to doing so at fair market value .
* Addressing undercapitalization problems directly : Because the purchase of troubled assets at fair market value may leave financial firms severely under- capitalized , the Treasury 's authority should be expanded to allow purchasing , again at fair market value , new securities issued by financial institutions in need of additional capital .
* Market - based discipline : to ensure that purchases are made at fair market value , the Treasury should conduct them through multi-buyer competitive processes with appropriate incentives .
* Inducing infusion of private capital : to further expand the capital available to the financial sector , and to reduce the use of public funds for this purpose , financial firms should be required or induced to raise capital through right offerings to their existing shareholders .
Compared with the Treasury 's proposed legislation , the alternative proposal put forward in this paper would provide a far better way to use taxpayers ' funds to address the financial crisis .
The approach of buying troubled assets through privately managed and competing funds put forward in this paper , which was subsequently followed by the Treasury in its March 2009 plan for buying troubled assets , is further developed in " How to Make TARP II Work , " a February 2009 discussion paper available at http://ssrn.com/abstract=1341939
The proposal for using competing private funds for buying trouble assets put forward in this paper is further developed in How To Make TARP II Work ( Harvard Law & Econ . Discussion Paper No. 626 , 2009 ) , available at http://papers.ssrn.com/abstract =1341939 , and in “ Buying Troubled Assets , Yale Journal on Regulation , 2009 , available at http://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=1392808.
Wall Street titan Lehman Brothers headed into bankruptcy Sunday after potential buyers Barclays Banks of Britain and Bank of America backed away , citing the Treasury ’s refusal to guarantee Lehman ’s toxic mortgage portfolio .
In weekend - long negotiations at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York , leaders of the Treasury , the Fed and the Securities and Exchange Commission sought to persuade the two banks , as well as other top Wall Street firms , to step forward and acquire all or part of Lehman to avoid a major downturn that could be triggered by a Lehman collapse when stock and credit markets reopen Monday .
Separately late Sunday , a person briefed on the deal said Bank of America Corp. is buying Merrill Lynch & Co. for about $ 50 billion , the Associated Press reported .
The deal will create a financial - services giant and lift the uncertainty that has shrouded the nation ’s biggest brokerage since the credit crisis began .
• Bank of America to acquire Merrill Lynch
• AIG looking at ‘ options ’ for businesses , capital
With no takers , the once - powerful Lehman planned to file for bankruptcy and liquidate its brokerage operations after 158 years in business Sunday night .
In anticipation of that happening , Wall Street firms conducted an unusual Sunday trading session in the $ 62 trillion credit - derivatives market to try to unwind sensitive credit - insurance deals backed by Lehman and forestall a potentially monumental crunch in the credit market on Monday .
Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Christopher Cox said customers of the brokerage are protected from losses on their investment accounts under a federal insurance program .
He urged any investors requiring help retrieving their money to contact the SEC .
“ For several days , we have worked closely with regulators around the world , including [ Britain , Germany and Japan ] to coordinate our actions in the interest of orderly markets , ” he said .
“ We are committed to [ reducing ] the potential for dislocations from recent events and to maintain the smooth functioning of the financial markets . ”
The Fed also made an adjustment in its loan program for Wall Street firms to accommodate Lehman and other investment banks that are struggling to cope with mounting credit losses .
It said it would accept lower - quality mortgage securities and credit instruments as collateral on the loans .
Previously , the Fed would accept only the highest - rated securities in exchange for the loans .
The federal involvement appeared minimal , aimed mostly at facilitating the liquidation of Lehman .
Federal officials and Wall Street leaders were at loggerheads all weekend over the critical issue of government involvement in the transactions .
Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. was adamantly against providing any guarantees on Lehman ’s money - losing assets like the guarantee the Fed provided on $ 29 billion of Bear Stearns mortgages in March to facilitate Bear ’s takeover by J.P. Morgan .
But Wall Street executives had little reason to put their own scarce capital into saving a competitor or backing its bad loans .
In addition , political and financial leaders have been calling on the Treasury to draw the line and let the Lehman investment house fail to prevent any further unnecessary losses for taxpayers after the Treasury ’s massive bailout of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac only a week ago .
Former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan told ABC ’s “ This Week ” Sunday that not all major financial institutions can be saved and that some are certain to fail in what he said may be the biggest credit crisis in a century .
“ This is a once in a half - century , probably once in a century type of event , ” he said .
“ We should n’t try to protect every single institution .
The ordinary cost of financial change has winners and losers .
“ What they are trying to do with Lehman is find a way in which there is no government money involved in this particular set of negotiations , ” he said .
“ If they can ’t , they have to make a very key decision as to whether they allow it to liquidate or support it . ”
Mr. Greenspan said the government should do what it can to ensure Lehman ’s failure is orderly and does not cause great turmoil to financial markets .
“ There are certain types of institutions which are so fundamental to the functioning of the movement of savings into real investments in an economy that on very rare occasions , and this is one of them , it ’s desirable to prevent them from liquidating in a sharply disruptive manner , ” he said .
Public opinion has come out strongly against another massive bailout only days after the government took responsibility for Fannie ’s and Freddie ’s gigantic debts .
Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Barack Obama said he is opposed to any government intervention to save Lehman and advocates a private - sector solution .
Republican presidential candidate Sen. John McCain has not taken a public position on the Lehman matter .
In the clearest sign that Lehman is headed for the bankruptcy courts in what would be the biggest Wall Street financial failure in decades , the International Swaps and Derivatives Association called for a special session Sunday to try to purge the intricately interconnected credit - default swaps market of insurance deals that would become worthless if Lehman goes bankrupt .
“ The purpose of this session is to reduce risk associated with a potential Lehman Brothers Holding Inc. bankruptcy , ” the association said .
But should bankruptcy be avoided , it added , any deals done during the Sunday session would “ cease to exist . ”
How the markets would react to Lehman ’s failure is the subject of much debate .
Most analysts feared it could cause a major disruption in the credit - insurance market , which was the reason behind Sunday ’s special session .
The broader stock and credit markets also may react negatively .
The one certain thing is that Lehman ’s own stock will plummet , erasing what little value it had at the end of trading on Friday , when it closed at $ 3.65 a share .
One loose end from the fruitless weekend negotiations was the fate of an estimated $ 85 billion in bad loans Lehman has on its books .
The company sought to separate those out and sell them , but found no buyers , and the government was unwilling to make them more salable by providing a guarantee .
Some analysts fear that if the loan portfolios are sold at fire - sale prices in bankruptcy proceedings , that will lead to further steep write - downs of similar loans on the books of nearly every other U.S. bank and financial institution , possibly triggering another round of deep losses and bank failures .
But many other Wall Street analysts have concluded that a Lehman bankruptcy can be absorbed by the financial system without great damage .
“ Six months after Bear , regulators should have ensured that a smallish investment bank could go under without systemic damage , ” said Richard Beales , analyst at Breaking Views.com .
“ If Hank Paulson and company feels the need to step in , it suggests that years of deregulation have locked in a government backstop for Wall Street ’s risk - taking . ”
“ Lehman has a negative net worth , ” said Peter Morici , business professor at the University of Maryland .
“ Most other banks need all the cash they have to cover their own bad securities , and any money they put into a crippled holding company would likely just be lost .
“ It is time to toss in the towel on Lehman , unwind the counterparty trades and march it through Chapter 7 , ” he said .

I ’ve been meaning for a while to write a post explaining just why Trooper - Gate matters — a lot .
And I will .
But for now read this piece just out from the Times on Palin ’s governing style .
In a different way it tells the same story — a small - minded person who populates her administration with cronies and grade - school friends , fires those who dare to criticize her and uses the power of her office to pursue personal vendettas .
In other words , someone in the habit of abusing official power who should not be let within a mile of being president .
Late Update : The Post , meanwhile , has a story about Palin ’s tenure as mayor .
Gist :
The position has limited responsibilities ; she hired a city administrator to take over a lot of those ; and her tenure was highly divisive .
And the same pattern of hiring cronies .
" After reading my opinion column in the Anchorage Daily News this morning , fellow Alaskan blogger Tom Lamb , asks " Why is it that Andrew Halcro who is so critical of Palin , wanted to be on the same ticket with her . "
That 's an easy answer ; because I believed Sarah Palin had the qualifications to be a terrific Lt. Governor .
And watching her struggle to give coherent answers on the national stage , I believe more today than ever before she has the qualifications to be a terrific Lt. Governor , " - Andrew Halcro , former Republican candidate for governor of Alaska .

Astrobiology Magazine posts an intriguing report today : The American Psychological Association is looking seriously at the question of astronauts ’ mental health .
It ’s an issue that has sometimes been swept under the rug , says the APA ’s press release :
Historically , astronauts have been reluctant to admit to mental or behavioral health problems for fear of being grounded .
But as missions get longer and astronauts are asked to do more , psychologists are looking at ways to help them cope with loneliness and interpersonal conflicts .
At Beth Israel Deaconess in Boston , psychologist James Carter ( who also studies teamwork in space ) and his group are building a tool to help astronauts deal with depression :
… a suite of interactive computer programs , dubbed the Virtual Space Station , using input from 13 veteran long - duration NASA astronauts who have flown on the International Space Station , Mir and Skylab . …
This interactive program will help astronauts prevent , detect , assess and manage their own psychosocial problems .
They will learn how to cope with depression and how to resolve conflicts with other astronauts .

Aristotle would have predicted that the velocity of a rolling ball was constant : double its time in transit and you would double the distance it traversed .
Galileo was able to show that the distance is actually proportional to the square of the time : Double it and the ball would go four times as far .
The reason is that it is being constantly accelerated by gravity .

Newton 's decomposition of sunlight with a prism
Isaac Newton was born the year Galileo died .
He graduated from Trinity College , Cambridge , in 1665 , then holed up at home for a couple of years waiting out the plague .
He had no trouble keeping himself occupied .
The common wisdom held that white light is the purest form ( Aristotle again ) and that colored light must therefore have been altered somehow .
To test this hypothesis , Newton shined a beam of sunlight through a glass prism and showed that it decomposed into a spectrum cast on the wall .
People already knew about rainbows , of course , but they were considered to be little more than pretty aberrations .
Actually , Newton concluded , it was these colors -- red , orange , yellow , green , blue , indigo , violet and the gradations in between -- that were fundamental .
What seemed simple on the surface , a beam of white light , was , if one looked deeper , beautifully complex .
( Ranking : 4 )
Cavendish 's torsion - bar experiment
Another of Newton 's contributions was his theory of gravity , which holds that the strength of attraction between two objects increases with the square of their masses and decreases with the square of the distance between them .
But how strong is gravity in the first place ?
In the late 1700's an English scientist , Henry Cavendish , decided to find out .
He took a six - foot wooden rod and attached small metal spheres to each end , like a dumbbell , then suspended it from a wire .
Two 350 - pound lead spheres placed nearby exerted just enough gravitational force to tug at the smaller balls , causing the dumbbell to move and the wire to twist .
By mounting finely etched pieces of ivory on the end of each arm and in the sides of the case , he could measure the subtle displacement .
To guard against the influence of air currents , the apparatus ( called a torsion balance ) was enclosed in a room and observed with telescopes mounted on each side .
The result was a remarkably accurate estimate of a parameter called the gravitational constant , and from that Cavendish was able to calculate the density and mass of the earth .
Erastothenes had measured how far around the planet was .
Cavendish had weighed it : 6.0 x 1024 kilograms , or about 13 trillion trillion pounds .
( Ranking : 6 )
Young 's light - interference experiment
Newton was n't always right .
Through various arguments , he had moved the scientific mainstream toward the conviction that light consists exclusively of particles rather than waves .
In 1803 , Thomas Young , an English physician and physicist , put the idea to a test .
He cut a hole in a window shutter , covered it with a thick piece of paper punctured with a tiny pinhole and used a mirror to divert the thin beam that came shining through .
Then he took ''a slip of a card , about one - thirtieth of an inch in breadth ' ' and held it edgewise in the path of the beam , dividing it in two .
The result was a shadow of alternating light and dark bands -- a phenomenon that could be explained if the two beams were interacting like waves .
PORT WASHINGTON , N.Y. ( MarketWatch ) --
We are nowhere near a depression , so let 's stop talking ourselves into one .
Spiro Agnew 's words of the Nixon era ring true today .
The politicians , pundits and , yes , the press , are nattering nabobs of negativism .
For example , in recent weeks , the broadcast and the print media have filed stories replete with scare words .
You do n't even have to look at the tabloids to see what I mean .
The front page of the New York Times recently described what it called " chaos " in the financial markets .
Not to be outdone , most of the first section of The Wall Street Journal one day last week was devoted to articles describing the " spreading crisis " in our economy .
And both newspapers have run stories using the word " depression " more times than I care to count .
Now , do n't get me wrong , I am not saying things are n't serious out there , but another Great Depression ?
I do n't think so .
If you look at the data , you will see more differences than similarities between the 1930s and today :
In the crash of 1929 the Dow Jones industrials DJIA , - 0.47 % plunged 40 % in two months ; this time around it has taken a year to fall 22 % .
plunged 40 % in two months ; this time around it has taken a year to fall 22 % .
The jobless rate jumped to 25 % by 1933 ; it is little more than 6 % today .
The gross domestic product shrank by 25 % during the early 1930s ; it is up over 3 % during the past year .
Consumer prices fell by about 30 % from 1929 to 1933 ; and the last time I looked they were still rising .
Home prices dropped more than 30 % during the Depression vs. about 16 % today .
Some 40 % of all mortgages were delinquent by 1934 compared with 4 % today .
In the 1930s , more than 9,000 banks failed compared with fewer than 20 over the past couple of years .
Remember also it was policy errors , not the stock market crash , that caused the Great Depression :
Instead of increasing the money supply , the Federal Reserve of that era reduced it by one - third .
Instead of lowering taxes , Herbert Hoover raised them .
And to channel whatever demand was left into U.S. - made goods , the government enacted the Smoot - Hawley Tariff
Act to keep out foreign products ; this only provoked our trading partners to do the same .
Add to this today 's automatic stabilizers such as unemployment insurance and Social Security , the FDIC to insure bank deposits and circuit breakers to keep stocks from falling too quickly , and you can see why this is not a depression in any way shape or form .
While I am at it , I would like to take issue with the almost ubiquitous use of the word " bailout " to describe the government 's rescue package .
Folks , this is not a bailout of anyone , not Wall Street , not Main Street , and certainly not the so - called " fat cats . "
It 's an infusion of liquidity , designed to unclog the financial markets .
In doing so , it will benefit everyone , business and consumers alike .
Also , the $ 700 billion bandied about will not be immediately handed over to the Treasury secretary ; he will simply have a line of credit , similar to what the typical business might have .
Finally , this package may not even cost $ 700 billion .
For that matter , it may wind up costing nothing .
It all depends on the price the government pays for these distressed assets and what it winds up selling them for .
As for whom to blame for this mess , there is plenty to go around .
In the words of that great philosopher , Pogo : " We have met the enemy and he is us . "
MADISON , Wis . — Police illegally videotaped a Wisconsin man having sex with his wife while she was in a coma in her nursing home room , an appeals court ruled Thursday .
David W. Johnson , 59 , had an expectation to privacy when he visited his wife at Divine Savior Nursing Home in Portage , the District 4 Court of Appeals ruled .
Therefore , police violated his Fourth Amendment rights against unreasonable searches when they installed a hidden video camera in the room , the court said .
“ We are satisfied that Johnson ’s expectation of privacy while visiting his wife in her nursing home room is one that society would recognize as reasonable , ” a unanimous three - judge panel wrote .
The ruling means prosecutors cannot introduce the video tapes as evidence in their case against Johnson , who is charged with felony sexual assault for having intercourse with his wife without her consent at least three times in 2005 .
Johnson ’s wife , Leah , was admitted to the nursing home after suffering a stroke , unable to speak or sit up .
Nursing home staff members fed , cleaned and turned her , checking on her at least every two hours .
Prosecutors say she was comatose .
Johnson ’s attorney Christopher Kelly said his client would visit the woman he married in 1988 every day , reading her the Bible and moving her arms and legs so her muscles would n’t atrophy .
The woman ’s sister , who is now her legal guardian , is upset that prosecutors brought charges against him , Kelly said .
“ She believes her sister ’s husband was merely expressing his love for his wife and was trying everything he could to bring her back to consciousness , ” Kelly said .
But nursing home staff members feared she was in danger because they suspected he was forcing her to have sex and tipped off police .
Police obtained a search warrant to videotape the room and installed the camera , which ran for three weeks .
Johnson , who is free on bail , was charged based on that evidence in 2005 .
Sauk County Circuit Judge Patrick Taggart , who heard the case out of Columbia County because of a request for a substitute judge , tossed out the videotape evidence last year , ruling it was an illegal search .
Prosecutors appealed , arguing Johnson had a right to privacy when he visited his wife to care for her but not when he used the room for intercourse .
The appeals court affirmed Taggart ’s ruling .
Johnson believed he could spend time alone with his wife in private , was lawfully on the premises and took precautions to seek privacy such as closing the door , the court said .
The court rejected the prosecution ’s argument that Johnson forfeited his right to privacy when he illegally had sex with his wife , noting proof of the assault “ has not been admitted . ”
“ The salient inquiry is whether Johnson ’s claim of privacy is consistent with historical notions of privacy involving a visit between spouses in a room in a nursing home , ” the court wrote .
“ We conclude that it is . ”
Department of Justice spokesman Bill Cosh said prosecutors are evaluating whether to ask the state Supreme Court to review the case .
Kelly said he believed prosecutors would be forced to drop the charges without the evidence on the tapes .
He said the appeals court made “ a pretty obvious call . ”
“ I think anybody who is visiting a spouse in a nursing home who is told , ‘ you can have a private visit and we wo n’t disturb you , ’ has reason to think he has privacy in the room , ” he said .
If the case goes to trial , Kelly said he would argue that intercourse did not amount to sexual assault .
Family members believe she “ would be perfectly happy to feel the love of her husband in that situation , ” he said .
Leah Johnson , 54 , remains in a coma at the nursing home , he said .
The couple did not have children .
During the big speech tonight , Sarah Palin took a swipe at Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid because like so many people , Reid ca n’t stand John McCain .
Not sure if she knows who Harry Reid is , but it was in the speech that was written for her .
Anyway , Reid ’s office responded ( via email ) :
Jim Manley , spokesman for Senator Reid : “ Anyone who knows Senator Reid knows he never backs down when he ’s fighting for what ’s right and that he always stands up to John McCain when he is wrong .
Shrill and sarcastic political attacks may fire up the Republican base , but they do n’t change the fact that a McCain - Palin administration would mean four more years of failed Bush - Cheney policies . ”
In our live blog of the Palin speech , I wrote “ Thanks for telling the world that Harry Reid ca n’t stand John McCain , Sarah .
That ’s one reason we love Harry Reid .
( p.s . You might want to talk to John McCain ’s GOP Senate colleagues .
They ca n’t stand him .
They really hate him .
His temper scares them .
You ’ll find that out soon enough , no doubt . ) ”
BAGHDAD , Iraq ( CNN ) --
A bomb exploded Tuesday outside a police recruitment center in Iraq 's Diyala province , killing at least 30 people , an Iraqi army official said .
Violence continued in Iraq a day after PM Nuri al - Maliki said a U.S. withdrawal plan must not be " open-ended . "
Nearly all the victims were Iraqi soldiers or recruits , the official said .
The official said the bomber drove a vehicle to the recruitment center and set off his explosives inside the vehicle .
Fifty - five others were wounded in the attack in the town of Jalawla .
Last month , Iraqi security forces backed by U.S. troops launched a large - scale military operation in Diyala to clear it of al Qaeda in Iraq and other insurgents .
In a separate incident , Iraqi police in Tikrit told CNN that a bomb in a parked car detonated Tuesday on a road close to the Salah Al - Din Health Administration Building .
The convoy of the general manager of the health administration , Dr. Hassan Zein Al - Abideen , was targeted but survived the attack , police said .
Police said four people -- two civilians and two policemen -- were killed .
Police said 14 people -- nine civilians and five policemen -- were wounded in the attack .
Iraqi and American joint forces surrounded the area and began searching it .
The American forces arrested a young man found close to the site of the explosion .
American forces also went to Tikrit General Hospital and evacuated some of the wounded to an American hospital , police said .
The local authority in Tikrit imposed a security zone around the area , banning vehicles and individuals .
Policemen also shut down shops in the area where the explosion took place , authorities said .
The bombings come a day after Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki said there will be no agreement on a U.S. withdrawal from Iraq unless it includes a " specific " timeline and is not " open-ended . "
Speaking with tribal leaders , sheikhs and other prominent figures , al - Maliki said U.S. and Iraqi negotiators have agreed that there would be no foreign soldiers in Iraq after 2011 but that some " outstanding issues " remain , according to a statement released by his office .
One issue the two sides have been working on involves the U.S. effort to keep U.S. troops in Iraq immune from Iraqi laws .
The sides have discussed a proposal that would lift immunity for private contractors , making them subject to Iraqi laws .
Al - Maliki 's statement Monday said he " will not allow the spilling of the blood of the sons of Iraq by granting open immunity . "

Forward widely ….
Everyone ,
This week the White House is going to try to push through the biggest robbery in world history with nary a stitch of debate to bail out the Wall Street bastards who created this economic apocalypse in the first place .
This is the financial equivalent of September 11 .
They think , just like with the Patriot Act , they can use the shock to force through the “ therapy , ” and we ’ll just roll over !
Think about it :
They said providing healthcare for 9 million children , perhaps costing $ 6 billion a year , was too expensive , but there ’s evidently no sum of money large enough that will sate the Wall Street pigs .
If this passes , forget about any money for environmental protection , to counter global warming , for education , for national healthcare , to rebuild our decaying infrastructure , for alternative energy .
This is a historic moment .
We need to act now while we can influence the debate .
Let ’s demonstrate this Thursday at 4 pm in Wall Street ( see below ) .
We know the congressional Democrats will peep meekly before caving in like they have on everything else , from FISA to the Iraq War .
With Bear Stearns , Fannie and Freddie , AIG , the money markets and now this omnibus bailout , well in excess of $ 1 trillion will be distributed from the poor , workers and middle class to the scum floating on top .
This whole mess gives lie to the free market .
The Feds are propping up stock prices , directing buyouts , subsidizing crooks and swindlers who already made a killing off the mortgage bubble .
Worst of all , even before any details have been hashed out , The New York Times admits that “ Wall Street began looking for ways to profit from it , ” and its chief financial correspondent writes that the Bush administration wants “ Congress to give them a blank check to do whatever they want , whatever the cost , with no one able to watch them closely . ”
It ’s socialism for the rich and dog - eat - dog capitalism for the rest of us .
Let ’s take it to the heart of the financial district !
Gather at 4 pm , this Thursday , Sept. 25 in the plaza at the southern end of Bowling Green Park , which is the small triangular park that has the Wall Street bull at the northern tip .
By having it later in the day we can show these thieves , as they leave work , we ’re not their suckers .
Plus , anyone who ca n’t get off work can still join us downtown as soon as they are able .
There is no agenda , no leaders , no organizing group , nothing to endorse other than we ’re not going to pay !
Let the bondholders pay , let the banks pay , let those who brought the “ toxic ” mortgage - backed securities pay !
On this list are many key organizers and activists .
We have a huge amount of connections – we all know many other organizations , activists and community groups .
We know P.R. folk who can quickly write up and distribute press releases , those who can contact legal observers , media activists who can spread the word , the videographers who can film the event , etc .
Do whatever you can – make and distribute your own flyers , contact all your groups and friends .
This crime is without precedence and we ca n’t be silent !
What ’s the point of waiting for someone else to organize a protest two months from now , long after the crime has been perpetrated ?
We have everything we need to create a large , peaceful , loud demonstration .
Millions of others must feel the same way ; they just do n’t know what to do .
Let ’s take the lead and make this the start !
AGAIN :
When : 4 pm – ?
Thursday , September 25 .
Where : Southern end of Bowling Green Park , in the plaza area
What to bring : Banners , noisemakers , signs , leaflets , etc .
Why :
To say we wo n’t pay for the Wall Street bailout
Who : Everyone !
Before taking a look at the monthly jobs data , let 's take a look at weekly claims .
The US Department of Labor is reporting Initial Unemployment Insurance Claims continue to rise .
Seasonally Adjusted
In the week ending July 26 , the advance figure for seasonally adjusted initial claims was 448,000 , an increase of 44,000 from the previous week 's revised figure of 404,000 .
The 4 - week moving average was 393,000 , an increase of 11,000 from the previous week 's revised average of 382,000 .
Unadjusted
The advance number of actual initial claims under state programs , unadjusted , totaled 375,627 in the week ending July 26 , a decrease of 36,898 from the previous week .
There were 257,426 initial claims in the comparable week in 2007 .
Jobs Decline 6th Consecutive Months
The unemployment rate rose to 5.7 percent , and nonfarm payroll employment continued to trend down in July ( - 51,000 ) , the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the U.S. Department of Labor reported today .
Employment continued to fall in construction , manufacturing , and several service - providing industries , while health care and mining continued to add jobs .
Average hourly earnings rose by 6 cents , or 0.3 percent , over the month .
Establishment Data
Highlights
22,000 construction jobs were lost
35,000 manufacturing jobs were lost
17,000 retail trade jobs were lost
24,000 professional and business services jobs were lost
5,000 service providing jobs were lost
1,000 leisure and hospitality jobs were added
25,000 government jobs were added
Birth / Death Model Absurd Once Again
BLS Black Box
The net birth / death model component figures are unique to each month and exhibit a seasonal pattern that can result in negative adjustments in some months .
These models do not attempt to correct for any other potential error sources in the CES estimates such as sampling error or design limitations .
Note that the net birth / death figures are not seasonally adjusted , and are applied to not seasonally adjusted monthly employment links to determine the final estimate .
The most significant potential drawback to this or any model - based approach is that time series modeling assumes a predictable continuation of historical patterns and relationships and therefore is likely to have some difficulty producing reliable estimates at economic turning points or during periods when there are sudden changes in trend .
Table A - 12
July Is A Revision Month For BLS
Looking ahead to the report on Friday , it important to consider that January and July are revision months for the BLS .
Guessing at what the Birth / Death Model revision will be is certainly fraught with danger , but I am going to go out on a limb anyway .
My guess the Birth Death revision will be - 425,000 and the actual reported jobs number for July will be - 178,000 , with unemployment rising to 5.7 % .
If the jobs number is negative , it would be the 7th consecutive monthly contraction .
These are the kind of guesses that can make one look silly but there they are .
I am also anticipating the first outright contraction in the service sector even with the strength that ADP is reporting in small businesses .
Whatever that strength is , I expect it to be flooded by losses this month and next given this June 25th report : U.S. Retail Store Closures Are Flirting with Six - Year High .
Scorecard
Microsoft has significantly lowered the price of many popular DLC bundles on Xbox Live as part of a special promotion called Extended Play Download Days .
The packages , listed in full below , are being reduced by varying degrees , offering up to 60 per cent off some of the most popular selections around .
Well , Microsoft says they 're popular .
Some are clearly going to be of more interest than others .
Nobody 's blood pressure is going to spike over a GBP 0.51 reduction for an extra Beautiful Katamari level , but The Shivering Isles with a third knocked off will probably send rat- punchers into spasms of ecstasy .
The price changes are active now , and they 'll be in place until the end of October .
Asynchronous DB : DBSlayer & HTTP
You hit a web 2.0 nerve and that magical ‘ viral coefficient ’ is working with full force , except now you ’ have a problem : scaling the database .
No problem , you say , we have a few tricks up our sleeve : faster disks , loads of memory , dataset sharding , load balancing , connection pooling , master - master and master - slave replication schemes , multiple caching layers … anything to minimize the latency of the database call .
The problem is that dreaded dynamic request which cuts through the cache and requires a blocking database query , which has an unfortunate side effect of locking up the resources on your application server as well .
Would n’t it be nice if we could fetch that data asynchronously instead ?
Over the years , there have been many attempts at asynchronous database drivers , with Asymy as the most recent Ruby variant by Thomas Ptacek .
However , every time someone starts another one of these projects , you have to wonder : why are we duplicating our efforts ?
After all , we already have a battle - tested protocol that we ’re all familiar with : HTTP .
Hence , when I saw the announcement , and later sat on a presentation of DBSlayer at MySQL Conf ‘ 08 , I knew that the guys at NYT were onto something big .
Database calls over HTTP
Instead of choosing a specific language or platform , DBSlayer speaks and understands JSON - something that any language ( even your browser ! ) can easily produce and consume .
With failover support , connection pooling , round - robin slave distribution , and a MySQL interface , I ’m surprised it has n’t received more attention !
Let ’s take it for a test drive :
# connect to localhost database , expose DBSlayer on port 81 $ dbslayer -s localhost -c mysql.conf -p 81 -l db.log # Check if it 's live $ curl http://192.168.0.198:81/stats
# {" current_time " : 1218011845 , " hits " : [ 8 , 1 ] , " slices " : [ 1218011724 , 1218011784 ] , " start_time " : 1218011724 , " total_requests " : 9}
Now that DBSlayer is up and running , accessing your database is as simple as making an HTTP call :
require ' rubygems ' require ' net / http ' require ' json ' require ' cgi ' # instead of querying the database , send a HTTP call to DBSlayer def http_request ( query ) Net :: HTTP . start ( ' localhost ' , 81 ) { | http | req =
Net :: HTTP :: Get . new ( ' / db ? ' + CGI . escape ( query . to_json ) ) response = http .
request ( req ) return JSON .
parse ( response .
body ) } end # select the database .
Output : # >> { " HOST_INFO " : " Localhost via UNIX socket " , " RESULT " : { " SUCCESS " : true} , " SERVER " : " localhost " } http_request ( { ' SQL ' => 'use dbslayer ' } ) # issue the real sql query !
Output : # >> [ " bobblehead " , 5 ] # >> [ " toy " , 2 ] # >> [ " gadget " , 3 ] http_request ( { ' SQL ' => ' select * from widgets ' } ) [ ' RESULT ' ] [ ' ROWS ' ]. each do | row | p row end
Asynchronous DB with DBSlayer and EventMachine
HTTP comes with some overhead , but it also offers the potential for hundreds of battle tested scalability tools .
One of which is the ability to easily turn any HTTP request into a non-blocking request !
Borrowing some sample code from my previous post on Ruby EventMachine , we have an easy Ruby web - server ( port 8082 ) which makes an asynchronous DB call to fetch the data :
require ' rubygems ' require ' eventmachine ' require ' evma_httpserver ' require ' json ' require ' cgi ' class Handler < EventMachine :: Connection include EventMachine :: HttpServer def process_http_request resp = EventMachine :: DelegatedHttpResponse . new ( self ) # connection pool on DBSlayer , tell the connection which DB we 're accessing .
query = { " SQL " => " USE dbslayer ; SELECT * from widgets " } http = EM :: Protocols :: HttpClient2 . connect ( " localhost " , 81 ) d = http . get " / db ? " + CGI .
escape ( query .
to_json ) # defer the response until we get response from DBSlayer d .
callback { resp .
status = 200 resp .
content = d . content resp .
send_response } end end EventMachine :: run { EventMachine :: start_server ( " 0.0.0.0 " , 8082 , Handler ) puts " Listening ... "
}
dbslayer-code.zip - Sample Net-HTTP , EventMachine , MySQL Ruby code
Scaling over HTTP
DBSlayer is a young project ( albeit deployed in production at NYTimes ) and there is definitely room for improvement : there are occasional crashes at high concurrency levels (> 500 req/s ) , more database drivers and better performance ( current tests show 30 % - 40 % decrease in throughput when compared to native drivers ) .
Nonetheless , it ’s definitely a project to keep an eye on , and of course , contribute to !
Liberal talker not sorry for calling McCain ' warmonger '
Show tells Raw Schultz plans to expand on remarks today
Three days after liberal talker Ed Schultz called presumptive Republican nominee John McCain a " warmonger , " Schultz went on to CNN 's American Morning and refused to back down from his remarks .
" I 'm sorry , John , the label sticks , " Schultz told CNN 's John Roberts .
" John McCain is a warmonger . "
Schultz called the Arizona senator a " warmonger " on Friday at a Democratic fundraiser in North Dakota , where his show is based .
McCain , responding to Schultz 's quip , called on Sen. Barack Obama ( D - IL ) to condemn them .
Obama replied that he did n't hear Schultz say it .
On Saturday , Obama campaign spokeswoman Jen Psaki said in a statement : " John McCain is not a warmonger and should not be described as such .
He 's a supporter of a war that Senator Obama believes should have never been authorized and never been waged . "
Yesterday , McCain said he considered the matter closed .
But Schultz is n't backing down .
A representative from his show tells RAW STORY he plans to mount a spirited defense of his remarks Friday on his nationally syndicated radio show today , which starts at noon .
DEVELOPING ....
This video is from CNN's American Morning , broadcast April 7 , 2008 .
With AP .
Yes , kids , science is a wonderful thing .
But not nearly as wonderful as climate modeling , which can perform supernatural miracles .
Honest !
Climate modeling can raise the level of the oceans ( even without Obama 's intervention ) , it can burn up the planet a hundred years from now , and Shazzam ! -- the models can save us again -- all without leaving your video games , and without the benefit of the real - world data that you need for boring old regular science .
At least , that 's what Nature -- the oldest science journal in the world , going back to Isaac Newton -- now claims .
According to credulous journalist extraordinaire Katharine Sanderson ( who has no degree in climatology ) , we are supposed to believe that " sophisticated climate chemistry models have shown that the ( Montreal ) Protocol has done much more than rescue the planet from sunburn . "
For all you great unwashed , the Montreal Protocol prohibited CFC's , which used to keep our refrigerators cold .
Now we find out that not only has Montreal saved the world 's ozone layer , but it has even postponed the dreaded catastrophe of Global Warming !
How do we know that ?
What 's the actual evidence ?
Well , ummmm ... well ... duuuhhh
Oh yes , it 's a " sophisticated climate chemistry model " !
Phew .
Nature.com tells us that
" The team worked out a predicted value for chlorine levels in the stratosphere ... in the year 2030 , on the basis of how quickly chlorine levels were rising in the late 1960s and early 1970s .
" Chlorine is known to be the main driver for atmospheric ozone depletion in the stratosphere , ...
" They ran this value of chlorine -- 9 parts per billion by volume ( ppbv ) -- through their computer models simulating climate chemistry .
For comparison , they also ran the models with a chlorine level of 3.5 ppbv , which was the level in the stratosphere by the late 1990s .
... ( The computer model ) showed what effect this ozone loss would have had on the planet 's climate at the surface .
And those changes are significant .
" ' What we 're seeing here is a big signal , ' says ( John ) Pyle ( the Cambridge scientist who led the modeling team ) . "
So -- pay attention to this , now , kids -- these video gamers extrapolated the chlorine numbers from fifty years ago , before satellites were available to measure that stuff .
Then they took another number from the 1990s .
Then they projected two decades ahead to 2030 what would have been the value of chlorine without and without the Montreal Protocol .
Then they took credit for the " improvement " in chlorine levels , which are supposed to stand for ozone levels , which are supposed to stand for global warming levels 22 years from now .
Got that ?
It is the ultimate example of scientific hubris .
As Bjorn Lomborg just wrote in The Guardian , of all places ,
" Much of the global warming debate is perhaps best described as a constant outbidding by frantic campaigners , producing a barrage of ever - more scary scenarios in an attempt to get the public to accept their civilisation - changing proposals .
Unfortunately , the general public -- while concerned about the environment -- is distinctly unwilling to support questionable solutions with costs running into tens of trillions of pounds .
Predictably , this makes the campaigners reach for even more outlandish scares . "
And Freeman Dyson , who is a real theoretical physicist , not the fake kind , wrote in his autobiography that :
" ... all the fuss about global warming is grossly exaggerated .
... I have studied the climate models and I know what they can do .
The models solve the equations of fluid dynamics , and they do a very good job of describing the fluid motions of the atmosphere and the oceans .
They do a very poor job of describing the clouds , the dust , the chemistry and the biology of fields and farms and forests .
They do not begin to describe the real world that we live in .
The real world is muddy and messy and full of things that we do not yet understand .
It is much easier for a scientist to sit in an air - conditioned building and run computer models , than to put on winter clothes and measure what is really happening outside in the swamps and the clouds .
That is why the climate model experts end up believing their own models . "
In no other field of science can you create a garbage - in / garbage - out video game about one of the most complex nonlinear systems known to science , the earth climate , and make wild guesses and get paid for it -- not to mention being celebrated in the pages of Nature .
You just take a data point from fifty years ago , add another point from the 1990s , project it all to 2030 , make inferences from chlorine to ozone to global warming , publish the result , and get celebrated for your non-existent proof of current pop orthodoxy about Armageddon .
And no , this is not " a big signal " in climate evidence , Professor Pyle .
It 's a big signal in your model .
If you tweak a dozen other variables you could change that result without ever leaving your desk .
And what 's more , you and all the other global warming frauds out there know that perfectly well .
This is a sad reflection of the corruption of the scientific enterprise .
Non fingo hypothesi , said Newton when he was urged to perform a similar miracle in his time : I do not make wildly speculative hypotheses .
Today we do perform miracles of prediction , and earn Nobel Peace Prizes for superannuated politicians , not to mention billions of dollars to support fraudulent superstition in the name of science .
Today 's climate modeling has gone far beyond Isaac Newton .
Or beyond any other scientist in history , for that matter .
Today , we can not only predict the things that will happen to Planet Earth a hundred years from now within a few degrees Centigrade , we can also tell you about all the terrible things that woulda happened if our Green politicians had n't passed the Montreal Protocol .
Whoever said scientists do n't believe in miracles ?
Former Fed chairman Alan Greenspan was on Sunday 's " This Week " and told George Stephanopoulos that the current financial crisis is a " once in a century " eventwhich he would n't bet on leading anywhere except to recession .
Gloomily , Greenspan explained how US house prices , now in freefall , underlie the US government paper that permeates the world economy - and that consequently the rest of the world is suffering even more than America is from a home - grown US financial collapse .
And , on Saturday the Associated Press reported remarks by Greenspan that clearly indicate he does n't think John McCain is the one to steer America and the world through that collapse .
" Unless we cut spending , no , " the former Federal Reserve chairman said Friday when asked about McCain 's proposed tax cuts , pegged in some estimates at $ 3.3 trillion .
" I 'm not in favor of financing tax cuts with borrowed money , " Greenspan said during an interview with Bloomberg Television .
" I always have tied tax cuts to spending . "
That McCain 's " Bush - Plus " budget planning , which would make Bush 's tax cuts permanent while introducing extra cuts benefiting mostly the very rich and corporations and would aim to offset those cuts by cutting earmark spending , comes up woefully short was pointed out by Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill ( D - Mo . ) :
McCaskill said eliminating congressional earmark spending — estimated at $ 17 billion annually — cannot offset McCain 's proposed tax cuts .
" That 's a huge amount of money , but it 's not even a drop in the bucket to pay for $ 3.5 trillion in tax cuts , " she said .
" So , every time he throws up earmarks and he 's asked how he 's going to pay for it , he knows he 's being disingenuous , he knows he 's not being forthcoming . "
It 'sa position that McCain 's own chief economic advisor also holds - as divulged in a forthcoming book .
Douglas Holtz - Eakin believes that " you ’re going to have to raise taxes whether you ’re a Republican , a Democrat or a Martian " but the McCain campaign campaign is n't taking his advice and he is n't speaking out in public about that because " “ It ’s the brand and you do n’t dilute the brand . ”

The ice has covered a larger area this year , though much has been thinner
Sea ice in the Arctic appears to have passed its minimum extent for 2008 without breaking last year 's record .
The US National Snow and Ice Data Center ( NSIDC ) says the ice covered 4.5 million sq km ( 1.7 million sq miles ) at its lowest point on 12 September .
Last year 's minimum was 4.1 million sq km ( 1.6 million sq miles ) .
This summer 's ice cover was the second lowest since satellite records began 30 years ago , which NSIDC says emphasises the " strong negative trend " .
People might be tempted to call it a recovery , but we 're still on a downwards trend towards ice - free Arctic summers
Dr Walt Meier , NSIDC
Temperatures have been lower in the Arctic this year than in 2007 , largely because of La Nina conditions , which create a colder climate globally from their source in the Pacific .
" I think this summer has been more remarkable than last year , in fact , because last year we had really optimal conditions to melt a lot of ice , " said Walt Meier , a research scientist at NSIDC in Boulder , Colorado .
" We had clear skies with the Sun blazing down , we had warm temperatures , and winds that pushed the ice edge northwards , " he told BBC News .
" We did n't have any of this this year , and yet we still came within 10 % of the record ; so people might be tempted to call it a recovery , but I do n't think that 's a good term , we 're still on a downwards trend towards ice - free Arctic summers . "
No laughing matter Even with cooler conditions anticipated , scientists had predicted at the beginning of the Arctic summer that last year 's record might be broken , because much of the ice was thinner than usual , having formed during only a single winter .
Instead , the 2008 graph now appears to be indicating the beginning of an expansion from the 12 September minimum , as the Arctic autumn sets in .
The melt did not reach last year 's record but was ahead of the 30 - year average
The NSIDC team will continue to monitor the ice area and will release a full analysis towards the end of this month .
The end of this summer will probably find the ice in a marginally healthier state than at this time last year .
Some of the thin floes remaining will presumably thicken during the winter , leaving the ice a little more robust .
With governments around the Arctic now seeking economic opportunities from a navigable ocean and a sea bed open to exploration , an important question is when the region will become ice - free in summers .
A few years ago , most computer models of climate were projecting dates about 80 years hence .
Then , as the melt rate accelerated around the turn of the millennium , the projected date advanced to about 2040 .
Now , some climate modellers expect to see nothing but open water within five years .
" To my mind that 's a bit aggressive , but certainly not impossible , " said Dr Meier .
" Five years ago that would have got someone laughed out of the room ; but no - one 's laughing now . "

After losing millions on derivatives , Jefferson County , Alabama , employs the rube defense .
This sounds unfair : JP Morgan almost certainly did n't understand the products , either .
Bloomberg :
At least seven former JPMorgan bankers are under scrutiny in a Justice Department criminal investigation of whether banks conspired to overcharge local governments on swaps and other derivatives .
JPMorgan also led a group of banks that charged $ 120 million in fees for such deals in Jefferson County , Alabama .
That was as much as $ 100 million too high , the county 's former adviser said .
Wall Street marketed unregulated derivatives as a way for municipalities to save money .
The financing , which local officials across the country have said they did n't understand , backfired this year as fallout from the global credit crisis caused borrowing costs to soar .
Now , Jefferson County can't afford its monthly payments and JPMorgan may be left holding defaulted debt .
JP Morgan now says that it will exit the municipal derivative market , a $ 2.6 trillion market , because the " risk / return profile for this business is such that the returns no longer justify the level of resources we have allocated to it , " according to a memo written by muni bonds boss Matt Zames .
Jefferson County is n't JPM 's only alleged victim .
The Erie Pennsylvania School District is also suing JPM for overcharging on its fees .
Perhaps JPM has decided that getting accuesed of swindling small towns results in more bad puclicity than it 's worth .
Attacks in the wild are under way against Linux systems with compromised SSH keys , the US Computer Emergency Readiness Team is warning .
The attacks appear to use stolen SSH keys to take hold of a targeted machine and then gain root access by exploiting weaknesses in the kernel .
The attacks then install a rootkit known as Phalanx2 , which scours the newly infected system for additional SSH keys .
There 's a viral aspect to this attack .
As new SSH keys are stolen , new machines are potentially vulnerable to attack .
The CERT advisory makes no mention of the flaw in the Debian random number generator , but that 's most likely the starting point for the attack .
The flaw caused SSL keys generated for more than a year to be so predictable that they could be guessed in a matter of hours .
Debian fixed the flaw in May .
Once a Linux server using a weak key is identified and rooted , it quickly gives up the keys it uses to connect to other servers .
Even if these new keys are n't vulnerable to the Debian debacle , attackers can potentially use them to access the servers that use them if both the private and public parts of the key are included .
Additionally , attackers can identify other servers that have connected to the infected machine recently , information that may enable additional breaches .
Phalanx2 is a derivative of a rootkit known as Phalanx .
According to Packet Storm , Phalanx is a self - injecting kernel rootkit designed for the Linux 2.6 branch that hides files , processes and sockets and includes tools for sniffing a tty program and connecting to it with a backdoor .
Phalanx2 is been updated to systematically steal SSH keys .
Fortunately , Phalanx2 is relatively easy to detect .
One tell - tale sign : typing " ls " at a command prompt fails to show a directory " /etc/khubd .p2 / " even though it can be accessed using the " cd " command .
Additionally , the " / dev/shm / " directory may contain files used in the attack .
Several tools , including this one , can be used to sniff out vulnerable keys .
CERT is also advising keys use strong passphrases or passwords to reduce the risk of a key is stolen .
" I 'm still absolutely adamant this is a problem system administrators should have handled a long time ago , " said Bill Stearns , a security researcher and incident handler for the SANS Internet Storm Center .
" It 's a really big issue .
If they have n't figured it out , someone will do it for them . " ®
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Industrialized countries pledged more than $ 6.1 billion on Friday to international investment funds aimed at helping developing countries adopt cleaner technologies and mitigate growth in greenhouse gas emissions , the World Bank said .
The first projects to benefit from grants , highly concessional loans and loan guarantee instruments from the Climate Investment Funds are expected to be announced in early 2009 , the World Bank said .
Representatives of 10 countries -- Australia , France , Germany , Japan , the Netherlands , Norway , Sweden , Switzerland Britain and the United States -- attended a donor conference hosted by the bank on Friday .
The United States has pledged $ 2 billion over three years , while Britain announced a commitment of 800 million pounds ( $ 1.47 billion ) .
Japan pledged up to $ 1.2 billion .
“ These funds are all about demonstrating that low - carbon development and climate resilient development can happen , ” Andrew Steer , director general at Britain ’s Department for International Development , said in a statement .
“ They will allow us to get on with helping developing countries with their efforts on climate action . ”
Two trust funds are being created under the Climate Investment Funds , which will be administered by the World Bank and by multilateral development banks .
The Clean Technology Fund will invest in projects and programs in developing countries that contribute to the demonstration , deployment , and transfer of low - carbon technologies .
The projects or programs must have a significant potential for long - term greenhouse gas savings .
The idea behind this fund , promoted heavily by U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson , was to bridge the cost gap between newer , cleaner technologies , such as wind farms in the power sector , and cheaper , but older and dirtier technologies , such as coal - fired power plants .
The second fund , the Strategic Climate Fund , will be broader and more flexible in scope .
It will serve as an overarching fund for various programs to test innovative approaches to climate change .
The first program under the strategic fund will work with several developing countries to study and develop strategies for dealing with the current effects of climate change , such as drought , tidal surges and agricultural problems .
The research will help these countries better prepare for climate change in their future development , the World Bank said .
Taxpayers are now on the hook for tens of billions of dollars of capital necessary to save Fannie Mae ( FNM ) and Freddie Mac ( FRE ) .
The CEOs of both companies -- the ones who ran them into the ground -- have thankfully been shown the door .
But they 're taking a nice pot of money with them .
Specifically , Dan Mudd , the CEO of Fannie Mae , is getting $ 9.3 million of severance for destroying his company .
Richard Syron , the CEO of Freddie Mac , is getting $ 14.1 million -- in part because of a clause he added to his employment contract two months ago , when it was clear the company was headed for disaster .
These severance payouts , of course , are chump - change relative to the usual CEO departure deals .
And Mudd and Syron have taken it on the chin with shareholders , as their options and restricted stock are now largely worthless .
But the severance money comes right out of the pockets of taxpayers , who did n't agree to the severance deals and are n't ponying up to save the companies because they want to .
Taxpayers are saving Fannie and Freddie because they have to -- because Mudd and Syron were incompetent .
" Incompetent " ?
Is that too harsh ?
Absolutely not .
Both men gambled big and lost bigger .
The fact that they may not have appreciated how big a risk they were taking is no defense :
If they did n't , they should have .
Both Mudd and Syron chose to run their companies at an astronomical level of leverage , borrowing more than $ 50 for every $ 1 they put to work .
Why ?
Because , in the good years , the companies made more money than they would have had they been levered , say , 20 - to - 1 .
Just because a housing crash of the current magnitude has n't happened since the 1930s does n't mean Mudd and Syron should n't have guarded against it .
Instead , they chose not to , and the companies -- and shareholders and taxpayers -- have paid the price .
Mudd and Syron should voluntarily renounce whatever severance they are " entitled " to and walk away empty - handed ( like the shareholders whose interests they were hired to look out for ) .
If they do n't , Paulson and the Treasury should refuse to pay them .

Let me start off by saying that I 'm making this whole thing up .
Imagine you 're in charge of infiltrating sleeper agents into the United States .
The year is 1983 , and the proliferation of identity databases is making it increasingly difficult to create fake credentials .
Ten years ago , someone could have just shown up in the country and gotten a driver 's license , Social Security card and bank account – possibly using the identity of someone roughly the same age who died as a young child – but it 's getting harder .
And you know that trend will only continue .
So you decide to grow your own identities .
Call it " identity farming . "
You invent a handful of infants .
You apply for Social Security numbers for them .
Eventually , you open bank accounts for them , file tax returns for them , register them to vote , and apply for credit cards in their name .
And now , 25 years later , you have a handful of identities ready and waiting for some real people to step into them .
There are some complications , of course .
Maybe you need people to sign their name as parents – or , at least , mothers .
Maybe you need doctors to fill out birth certificates .
Maybe you need to fill out paperwork certifying that you 're home - schooling these children .
You 'll certainly want to exercise their financial identity : depositing money into their bank accounts and withdrawing it from ATMs , using their credit cards and paying the bills , and so on .
And you 'll need to establish some sort of addresses for them , even if it is just a mail drop .
You wo n't be able to get driver 's licenses or photo IDs on their name .
That is n't critical , though ; in the U.S. , more than 20 million adult citizens do n't have photo IDs .
But other than that , I can't think of any reason why identity farming would n't work .
Here 's the real question :
Do you actually have to show up for any part of your life ?
Again , I made this all up .
I have no evidence that anyone is actually doing this .
It 's not something a criminal organization is likely to do ; 25 years is too distant a payoff horizon .
The same logic holds true for terrorist organizations ; it 's not worth it .
It might have been worth it to the KGB – although perhaps harder to justify after the Soviet Union broke up in 1991 – and might be an attractive option to existing intelligence adversaries like China .
Immortals could also use this trick to self - perpetuate themselves , inventing their own children and gradually assuming their identity , then killing their parents off .
They could even show up for their own driver 's license photos , wearing a beard as the father and blue spiked hair as the son .
I ’m told this is a common idea in Highlander fan fiction .
The point is n't to create another movie plot threat , but to point out the central role that data has taken on in our lives .
Previously , I 've said that we all have a data shadow that follows us around , and that more and more institutions interact with our data shadows instead of with us .
We only intersect with our data shadows once in a while – when we apply for a driver 's license or passport , for example – and those interactions are authenticated by older , less - secure interactions .
The rest of the world assumes that our photo IDs glue us to our data shadows , ignoring the rather flimsy connection between us and our plastic cards .
( And , no , REAL - ID wo n't help . )
It seems to me that our data shadows are becoming increasingly distinct from us , almost with a life of their own .
What 's important now is our shadows ; we 're secondary .
And as our society relies more and more on these shadows , we might even become unnecessary .
Our data shadows can live a perfectly normal life without us .

Palin also will attend fund - raisers around Ohio next week .
WASHINGTON -- Sen. Hillary Clinton 's visits to Akron and Elyria on Sunday to stump for Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama are coming not a moment too soon for anxious Ohio Democrats .
With two new polls this week showing a tight race in Ohio , Democratic officials say they worry that Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin has boosted GOP nominee John McCain 's prospects in the state , and that Obama has his work cut out for him if he wants to secure Ohio 's crucial 20 electoral votes .
Obama will need to not only sharpen his message about his differences with McCain on economic issues , officials in several key swing counties said this week , but also continue to seek plenty of help on the campaign trail from popular Democrats like Clinton , her husband and Gov. Ted Strickland .
Such help , they said , will be particularly important in non-urban areas of Ohio where Palin is likely to appeal to Republicans and independents and where Clinton trounced Obama in the primary last winter .
" We had tons of new Democrats who came out to vote for Hillary ...
Now a lot of those voters are on the fence , " said Stephen Madru , Democratic Party Chairman in Ross County in southern Ohio , which narrowly supported President Bush in 2000 and 2004 after backing former President Bill Clinton in 1996 .
Madru said he fears Palin is attracting gun owners and religious conservatives in southern Ohio who previously were unimpressed by McCain .
" I thought they just would n't vote .
Now I 'm afraid they are going to vote , which tends to change the whole dynamics of the thing , " he said .
" It scares the heck out of me . "
In nearby Scioto County , which voted Republican in the last two presidential elections and Democratic in the previous two , Democratic chairman Randy Basham says race is one of many hurdles Obama will need to overcome to beat McCain in southeastern Ohio .
" It 's Appalachia .
Race will be a factor here , " said Basham .
" When you get out here in rural America , it 's going to be tough . "
For Obama to lure Scioto County voters who backed Strickland in 2006 , Basham said , he needs to woo independents by focusing on bread - and - butter economic issues such as the minimum wage and the high cost of health care and gasoline , and draw a stark contrast between his positions and McCain's .
It also would help , Basham said , if Obama would show up in person in Ohio's Appalachian counties to " help break the ice on the race thing " -- especially if he were accompanied by politicians like Strickland or the Clintons who are popular among the area 's economically struggling voters .
" He ( Strickland ) needs to travel with him and say , ' Look , I 'm touching him .
He 's real .
He 's a person that can help you with your needs here in southern Ohio .
He 's what I need as governor , ' " said Basham .
Concerns about Obama 's ability to carry independent voters are not confined to southern Ohio .
In Geauga County , Democratic chair Janet Carson says she fears race is " the big gorilla in the corner of the room that nobody wants to talk about . "
Carson said she hopes Obama will not let various GOP attacks distract him from focusing relentlessly on jobs and the economy .
And , like Basham , she said she hopes Obama will travel - and send high - profile surrogates to travel -- outside cities to more rural and exurban parts of the state that Strickland targeted in 2006 .
The personal touch will be necessary in places like Geauga County , she said , to help counter McCain 's choice of Palin , whom she called " a brilliant pick . "
" Sarah Palin is exactly what McCain needs to appeal to a broader base of voters .
It has made our job harder , " said Carson .
Two polls released this week highlight Democratic concerns about the challenge facing Obama .
The Ohio Poll , released Friday by the University of Cincinnati , shows McCain ahead 48 - 44 .
The Quinnipiac University Poll , released Thursday , shows Obama ahead 49 - 44 .
In both polls , McCain has the edge among independent voters and is way ahead in southeast Ohio , a region Strickland and both Clintons won .
Quinnipiac shows 28 percent of Clinton primary voters supporting McCain .
Both polls , however , also found that many voters have yet to firmly commit to either candidate .
And Democrats say they remain optimistic that Obama can carry Ohio -- especially if Palin 's popularity wanes after the initial surge of curiosity about her subsides .
" It 's doable , but we have to work hard at it , " said Dan Saks , a Clark County Democratic official .
" It is n't going to come easy . "
Saks said McCain 's bounce in the polls after the GOP convention was " a bit of a wake - up call " for Democrats in his swing county , which sits between Columbus and Dayton .
" The newness of Sarah Palin certainly raised the excitement level , " he said , referring to Republican and independent voters .
" My hope is people will realize she 's not as she 's being painted . "
Saks and several other Ohio Democratic officials said Palin has had one positive effect for them - spurring more Democrats who disagree with her to volunteer for Obama .
In Medina County , which tends to vote Republican but supported Strickland in 2006 , Democratic chair Pam Miller said she saw a spike in volunteers after Palin was chosen .
An open house at Democratic headquarters last week after the GOP convention , she said , drew 150 people .
" For us that was really phenomenal , " she said .
Solar industry 's challenge is to lower cost Intersolar trade show opens first U.S. meeting at Moscone Center
Charles Gay , general manager of Applied Materials � solar power division , said solar power in California currently costs about 30 cents per kilowatt hour , or 17 cents when federal tax credits for large solar systems are taken into account .
By contrast , wholesale power prices in the state tend to fall between 8 cents and 11 cents per kilowatt hour , according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration .

The solar power industry - in California and worldwide - is growing fast .
Now , it needs to focus on price .
That was the message from several speakers Tuesday at the opening of Intersolar North America , the first U.S. edition of the world 's largest solar trade show .
The show , at San Francisco 's Moscone Center , runs through Thursday and is being held in conjunction with the Semicon West trade fair for the semiconductor industry .
Intersolar 's organizers and attendees spoke on Tuesday of solar 's bright future , its role in the fight against climate change and the need to wean the world off fossil fuels .
But several of those in the show noted that solar remains far more expensive than other forms of energy .
Only when its price approaches or beats the cost of power generated from fossil fuels will it reach its full potential .
" The faster we reach this point , the better for the world , and the better for the country that goes first , " said Eicke Weber , a UC Berkeley professor emeritus who helped organize the show .
MBA BY THE BAY : See how an MBA could change your life with SFGATE 's interactive directory of Bay Area programs .
No one can say for certain when that point will arrive .
" That 's the $ 64,000 question , " said Cathy Boone , senior director of global marketing for solar power at Applied Materials .
" The entire industry understands we need to get competitive with the cost of fossil fuels . "
Solar proponents have argued for years that prices would fall as production increased , but it has n't happened yet .
In fact , prices for solar panels rose for several years due to a shortage of silicon , the key material used by companies making the panels .
Critics complain that the technology will never become cheap enough to be widely used in China , India and the developing world , thereby limiting its use as a weapon against global warming .
Charles Gay , general manager of Applied Materials ' solar power division , said solar power in California currently costs about 30 cents per kilowatt hour , or 17 cents when federal tax credits for large solar systems are taken into account .
By contrast , wholesale power prices in the state tend to fall between 8 cents and 11 cents per kilowatt hour , according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration .
One kilowatt hour is enough electricity to light a 100 - watt bulb for 10 hours .
Gay said , however , that the long - awaited drop in price will arrive , just as it did in the semiconductor industry .
" As we 've learned , by manufacturing to scale , price will fall , " he said .
Certainly , the industry is growing in size .
The Intersolar trade show itself is proof .
Intersolar began in 2000 , in Freiburg , Germany , capitalizing on that country 's keen interest in renewable power .
Five years ago , 12,000 people attended .
This year , Intersolar 's European trade show drew nearly 52,000 .
Expanding to North America was the next logical step .
Weber had the idea when he attended Intersolar 's trade show last year in Freiburg .
He had returned to his native Germany after 23 years in Berkeley , and the trade show immediately made him think of the Bay Area .
" I thought , ' My God , this type of show we should have in San Francisco , ' " said Weber , who now heads a solar research institute in Freiburg .
" You can feel the excitement in the air here . "
About 12,000 people have registered to attend this week 's event , and 210 solar companies will hawk their wares .
THE soaring price of bacon has led to an increase in thefts and a rise in ‘ black market ’ trading across East Lancashire .
And one shop in Burnley has already removed its bacon supply from the self - service fridge with customers having to ask at the till if they want to buy a pack .
Other shopkeepers said they have experienced similar problems with shoplifters targeting the meat on their shelves .
Butchers said that the price of bacon was increasing with financial experts blaming rising demand from China for pushing up prices .
And police said thieves target the meat , often to order , because it is ‘ easy to sell ’ due to high demand .
In the Londis store , at Kitchens Garage , Trafalgar Street , Burnley , a sign has been put up on its fridge saying : “ Due to the fact that our bacon is so delicious the shoplifters ca n’t resist it .
" If you would like to try some please ask at the tills . ”
The store manager , who asked not to be named , said she took the decision to put the sign up in a bid to foil thieves .
She added : “ I put the sign up after shoplifters emptied the shelf for two days running and I was sick of them taking it .
“ It ’s a regular thing - we catch a few and they stop but then it starts again .
" They steal it because they can sell it .
Someone stole a load of cheese from the shelf yesterday . ”
Figures from the British Retail Consortium ( BRC ) show that the price of bacon has almost doubled in the past year and food price inflation has jumped to 10 per cent in August .
Demand from China , which eats more pork products than anywhere else in the world , has also driven up the price , especially since a UK ban on exporting the meat was lifted last month .
Local award - winning butcher Stephen Berkins , who has a shop on Rosegrove Lane , Burnley , confirmed that the average price for a pack of bacon is between £ 2.50 and £ 3.50 depending on the quality .
He said : “ The price of bacon has gone up recently .
The average cost for a pound of bacon is around £ 3 or £ 3.50 for the dry - cured . ”
Police confirmed that there has been a recent increase in bacon thefts and said it is an ‘ ongoing ’ issue .
Sgt Phil Carter , of Burnley Police , said : “ Heroin addicts steal it , along with items like coffee , because it is an easy commodity to sell and easy to conceal in a jacket .
" They often steal it to order and then sell it for half the price of what it is sold for in the shops .
“ If a wrap of heroin costs around £ 10 , they only need to sell a few packs of bacon to pay for it and they can steal that in one fell swoop .
“ They target stores like Londis because they have 24 - hour opening times and are self service . ”
A shop assistant at the One Stop store , in King Street , Bacup said they have had to ‘ limit ’ the number of packs of bacon on display after thieves repeatedly stole the product from the fridge .
In 2006 , Pastor Mac Hammond stood up before his Living Word Christian Center audience in Brooklyn Park and said , “ I can tell you personally that I ’m going to vote for Michele Bachmann , because I ’ve come to know her , what she stands for . ”
That speech prompted the attention of the Internal Revenue Service for violation of the church ’s tax exempt status .
The IRS sent the church a letter telling the church it cannot endorse politicians from the pulpit .
Despite ample evidence that suggested Hammond knew that what he was doing was illegal , the case was closed .
Now an Arizona - based front group for the religious empire of James ( Focus on the Family ) Dobson , the Alliance Defense Fund , is encouraging en masse violation of the IRS rule that prohibits clergy from endorsing political candidates .
They ’re asking ministers of kindred spirit across the country to endorse presidential candidates on Sunday , September 28 .
Dubbed the “ Pulpit Initiative , ” the gambit represents a bet on lax enforcement by the IRS and , ultimately , a free - speech - based challenge to the law by a very conservative US Supreme Court .
Since 1954 , churches have been prohibited from explicit involvement in political campaigns .
To date , only one church in the last 50 years has lost its tax exemptions .
That occurred in 1992 , when an outfit called Branch Ministries took out full - page ads in the Washington Times and USA Today proclaiming , “ Christian Beware ” and warning that Bill Clinton espoused “ policies that are in rebellion to God ’s Laws . ”
Federal courts upheld the revocation of Branch Ministries ’ tax status .
The ADF says the Pulpit Initiative is to encourage pastors to reclaim “ their right to speak Scriptural truth from the pulpit ” and to confront “ an atmosphere of intimidation and fear for any church that dares to speak Scriptural truth about candidates for office . ”
The group says it has recruited churches in every state to endorse candidates on the chosen date .
But some clergy and former IRS officials say that ADF is violating the law just by organizing this sort of mass lawbreaking event .
“ In the course of organizing and publicizing this event , ADF ’s staff of attorneys is inducing churches to engage in conduct designed to violate Federal tax law in a direct and blatant manner , ” wrote Mortimer M. Caplin , IRS commissioner during the Kennedy administration ; Marcus S. Owens , former head of the IRS ’s tax - exempt division ; and Cono R. Namorato , the former head of the IRS office of professional responsibility .
“ This activity — coordinating mass violation of Federal tax law — is clearly ‘ incompetent and disreputable conduct ’ …
In our view , these ADF efforts present a direct threat to the integrity of our tax system . ”
Beside Hammond ’s 2006 endorsement of Bachmann , a northern Minnesota church made news this summer for endorsing Sen.
John McCain for president — and flaunting it in the face of the IRS .
Rev. Gus Booth , a pastor in Warroad , Minn. , and Republican party activist , said in a May sermon , “ If you are a Christian , you cannot support Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama .
Both Hillary and Barack favor the shedding of innocent blood [ abortion ] and the legalization of the abomination of homosexual marriage . ”
In a letter in his church bulletin , Booth wrote of the IRS , “ I am letting you know that I will not be intimidated into silence when I believe that God wants me to address the great moral issues of the day , including who will be our next national leader . ”
According to IRS data , it ’s not just the religious right that runs afoul of the IRS .
Of the 42 churches that were sent letters by the IRS in 2004 , 18 endorsed a GOP candidate , 12 a Democratic and one a Green Party candidate .
In 11 instances , the IRS did not determine a party affiliation .
A church in Southern California made news in 2004 when its pastor offered an anti-war sermon and the IRS pursued the case .
The church insisted that it did not endorse a candidate .
The IRS agreed and dropped the case .
The IRS has also gone after an entire denomination .
The tax agency is investigating the United Church of Christ because of a speech that Obama gave at that group ’s national meeting last year .
Obama is a member of the UCC .
The IRS is also investigating a Hartford , Conn. , UCC church that Obama spoke at earlier this year .
A small gadget that can be fitted to diesel engines boosts fuel efficiency by up to 19 % and can make them run more cleanly , engineers report .
A weak electric field is used to make fuel less viscous before it is injected into the engine .
That makes it possible to spray smaller drops that burn more completely .
The device was developed at Temple University in Philadelphia , Pennsylvania and costs less than $ 200 to produce .
In tests over six months on a 2002 Mercedes - Benz 300D sedan , a prototype device increased fuel efficiency by 12 to 15 % under urban driving conditions , and 19 % in highway driving – taking it from 32 to 38 miles per gallon .

“ This is the biggest efficiency increase since the advent of fuel injection , ” claims Rongjia Tao from Temple University .
The device has been licensed to Californian firm Save the World Air , which is now testing it in road haulage vehicles .
Fluctuating flow
An electric field makes diesel thinner because some molecules in the fuel become charged and aggregate together , reducing their overall surface area .
That means less friction between them , and a less viscous fuel .
Tao and colleagues believe fuel efficiency gains were lower under stop - start urban driving conditions because the rate at which fuel flows through their device constantly varies .
They are working on a version that varies its electric field to match fuel flow rate and keep viscosity constantly reduced .
Matt Thomas of CFD Research Corporation works on similar fuel electrification techniques .
He says fitting the device to new cars will not produce such spectacular efficiency gains , but adds that it would still cut emissions .
“ [ If ] you charge spray prior to fuel injection you could lower particulate emissions by as much as a factor of 10 . ”

The US government has announced sweeping measures to shore up the nation 's two largest mortgage finance companies , Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae .
The plan calls on Congress to expand the companies ' access to credit and allow the Treasury to buy shares in the companies if needed .
The two firms own or guarantee almost half of all US home loans - more than $ 5 trillion ( £ 2.5 trillion ) of debt .
Their share prices sank last week on fears they may struggle to raise funds .
The BBC's Greg Wood in New York says the emergency measures are meant to allay fears that the two companies are about to run out of money .
Investors welcomed the news , sending Freddie Mac 's shares up 17.6 % and Fannie Mae 's up 24.9 % at the start of Wall Street trade .
However by the close of trading both had slid into negative territory , with Fannie Mae falling 5.1 % to $ 9.73 , and those of Freddie Mac slid 8.3 % to $ 7.11 .
Key role
Announcing that new credit lines would be sought from Congress , Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said : " Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac play a central role in our housing finance system and must continue to do so in their current form as shareholder - owner companies . "
FREDDIE MAC & FANNIE MAE
The two firms :
Buy mortgages from approved lenders and then sell them on to investors - rather than lending directly to borrowers Guarantee or own about half of the $ 12 trillion US mortgage market
Are relied on by almost all US mortgage lenders
Are looked to for funds to meet consumer demand for home mortgages
Link mortgage lenders with investors - keeping the supply of money widely available and at a lower cost
Have no direct UK equivalent
Q&A : Freddie Mac / Fannie Mae Importance of Freddie and Fannie
He added that their " support for the housing market " was " particularly important as we work through the current housing correction " .
The Federal Reserve also said it would lend to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac if they needed additional funds .
The two firms play an important role in the financial markets in providing funding for home loans by buying up mortgages and packaging them as investments .
As mortgage backers , the companies have had to pay out when homeowners have defaulted on their loans .
Last week , investor concern that the government might have to bail out Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac because of the huge losses they have suffered in the US property crash sent their shares plummeting Without Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae , US mortgages would be much dearer
If either firm were to fail , the consequences for the already fragile US financial system would be disastrous as mortgage lending could virtually dry up , our correspondent says .
Restore stability Both firms have defended their finances , saying they had enough capital to weather the housing slump .
Freddie Mac is due to sell $ 3bn in short - term debt on Monday , which is seen as a critical test of confidence in the mortgage companies .
As many private sector banks consider reducing their mortgage business , the US government has increasingly looked to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to help restore stability to the market .
Steps to shore them up is a positive but the fact that they are having difficulties in the first place is just symptomatic of a difficult environment out there
Greg Goodsell
Analyst , ABN Amro " Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac play an important role in our housing finance system , and they should continue to play this role in their current forms , " White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said in a statement on Sunday .
Both are privately - owned companies mandated by the US Congress to provide funding to the housing market .
Our correspondent says confidence in many of America 's financial institutions is wearing dangerously thin .
Queues of nervous customers are expected later on Monday at IndyMac , a Californian mortgage lender that was taken over by the federal authorities on Friday night , in the second - biggest banking collapse in US history .
After heavy falls in world stock markets on Friday , Asian shares were mixed on Monday as investors absorbed the US government 's plans .
" Steps to shore them up is a positive but the fact that they are having difficulties in the first place is just symptomatic of a difficult environment out there , " said Greg Goodsell , equity strategist with ABN AMRO in Sydney .
" And that makes it hard to get too positive . "

With anxiety about hedge - fund woes gripping the market , funds have their own fear : their investors .
Some investors , particularly what are known as " funds of funds , " are demanding their money back and may ramp up requests in the weeks ahead .
That has prompted hedge - fund managers to sell securities to raise cash .
" As the hedge fund investor base broadens , hedge fund portfolio management ... slips out of the hands of the portfolio managers and into the hands of the investors , " wrote Andrew Redleaf , who runs Whitebox Advisors , a Minneapolis hedge fund with about $ 5 billion under management , in an August client letter .
" It is no insult to the investors to say that this worsens performance . "
Funds - of - funds select hedge funds on behalf of pension funds , wealthy individuals or other investors , and charge a layer of fees on top of the hefty fees levied by hedge funds themselves .
They often ask hedge funds for the option to redeem money as often as monthly and get good terms because they can bring in big chunks of cash at once .
Some put in withdrawal notices to keep their options open , though they may ultimately decide to leave the money .
He also says he believes that a manually focused lens often surpasses the accuracy of the few autofocus lenses he still owns .
“ There is a tactile quality to holding onto a metal focus ring , ” said Mr. Yates .
“ The damping of the ring  the resistance  allows me to fine - tune the focus so much more accurately .
When I manual - focus with the newer lenses , they just do n’t feel the same . ”
Usually all that is needed to get many vintage lenses working on a new camera is a simple twist - on adapter , costing $ 10 to $ 30 .
Because each adapter is unique to a specific lens mount and camera combination and adapters are relatively inexpensive as camera gear goes , photographers usually buy a separate adapter for each lens .
They can be found on eBay , though some manufacturers , like Pentax , sell their own .
Many vendors sell generic adapters , but it is best to search online for reviews on the quality and compatibility of specific lens , camera and adapter combinations .
Online photography communities like fredmiranda.com and ManualFocus.org are good places to start the research .

The old lenses are an alternative to expensive , contemporary models that do fit the new cameras .

But like shooting with a manual lens , buying them can be complicated .
For mechanical and optical reasons , some brands of D.S.L.R. ’s work with a wider array of vintage lenses than others .
Nikon D.S.L.R.’s can take scores of vintage Nikon lenses without adapters .
But the Nikon cameras do n’t work well , if at all , with the majority of vintage lenses from makers like Olympus , Pentax and Zeiss .
Canon cameras have the opposite characteristic .
They are incompatible with most vintage Canon lenses , but with cheap adapters can mount dozens of brands of third - party vintage lenses .
Olympus D.S.L.R.’s can mount most of the same vintage lenses Canon cameras can , along with vintage Olympus lenses if you have the adapters .
Pentax D.S.L.R.’s can mount just about every Pentax lens ever made and the third - party lenses that use the Pentax - style lens - mount .
Sony D.S.L.R.’s are the least compatible of the major manufacturers .
Those cameras work with certain Minolta lenses and , with an adapter , lenses that use what is known as an M42 screw mount .
One of the few studies to look at the effects of religious participation on the mental health of minorities suggests that for some of them , religion may actually be contributing to adolescent depression .
Previous research has shown that teens who are active in religious services are depressed less often because it provides these adolescents with social support and a sense of belonging .
But new research has found that this does not hold true for all adolescents , particularly for minorities and some females .
The study found that white and African - American adolescents generally had fewer symptoms of depressive at high levels of religious participation .
But for some Latino and Asian - American adolescents , attending church more often was actually affecting their mood in a negative way .
Asian - American adolescents who reported high levels of participation in their church had the highest number of depressive symptoms among teens of their race .
Likewise , Latino adolescents who were highly active in their church were more depressed than their peers who went to church less often .
Females of all races and ethnic groups were also more likely to have symptoms of depression than males overall .
Setting all other factors aside , the results suggest that participating in religion at high levels may be detrimental to some teens because of the tensions they face in balancing the conflicting ideals and customs of their religion with those of mainstream culture , said Richard Petts , co-author of the study , who did the work as a doctoral student in sociology at Ohio State University .

“ Most research has shown that religious participation , for the most part , is good and can be very helpful for battling depression .
But our research has shown that this relationship does not hold true in all instances , ” he said .
While the study shows that females and males from certain groups may be more inclined to become depressed , involvement in religious services still had an overall positive affect for many youth in the study .
The results do provide important insight into the impact of religious participation on teenage depression , but race and gender may only be part of the reason certain youth were more depressed , Petts said .
“ The study shows that we need to consider the broader social aspects of institutions such as religion on an individual ’s well being , both good and bad .
We focus specifically on race and gender , but these are not the only two factors that may be contributing to higher and lower depression among youth , ” he said .
Petts , who is now an assistant professor of sociology at Ball State University , conducted the study with Anne Jolliff when they were both doctoral students at Ohio State .
Jolliff is now a research coordinator at Indiana University - Purdue University Indianapolis .
The pair based the study on data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health , a study surveying middle and high school students throughout the United States .
Adolescents in grades 7 through 12 were initially interviewed in school and a random number of students were again interviewed at home .
Students were asked to identify the positive and negative feelings they had experienced in the preceding week such as depression , loneliness , isolation , happiness , or excitement .
They were also asked about their behavior in the last year and asked to identify their race , religious preference , and how often they attended services during the same period of time .
Adolescents were then interviewed a second time one year later at home about the same topics .
Parents of these adolescents were also asked about their child ’s moods and behaviors .
Only the 12,155 adolescents who participated in both parts of the study and had information from their parents were included in this study .

The results were recently published in the journal Review of Religious Research .
Among adolescents who never attended church , Asian - American adolescents reported 4 percent fewer symptoms of depression in the preceding week than did their African - American peers .
In comparison , Asian - American youth who attended church at least once a week reported 20 to 27 percent more symptoms of depression than their white and African - American peers who attended at the same level .
Latino adolescents fared about the same as Asian Americans , reporting 6 to 14 percent higher rates of depression symptoms than did African - American and white teens when attending church at least once a week .
The results showed that in stark contrast to the findings for white and African - American adolescents , Asian - American adolescents who never attended services and Latinos attending at intermediate levels were the least likely to be depressed within their groups .
The results suggest that something unique was affecting adolescents within these two groups when they went to church often .
Petts believes that the traditional nature of religion for these two groups may be conflicting with the ideals and customs of mainstream American society .
This conflict may be putting additional stress on these youth as they try to balance competing principles and traditions , he said .
“ Asian and Latino youth who are highly involved in a culturally distinct church may have a more difficult time balancing the beliefs of their family and their traditional culture with mainstream society .
Their religious institution is telling them what should be important in their lives and how to behave , and mainstream society is saying something else , ” he said .
At higher levels of participation , Asian - American and Latino adolescents had a harder time juggling which set of ideals to adopt because they were more involved and committed to their religion .
Meanwhile , Asian - American adolescents who had lower levels of involvement in church were able to focus more on life without worrying about conflicting ideals , resulting in lower depression .
At lower levels of involvement , adolescents still gained the social support of their religious community while also feeling in touch with mainstream society , Petts said .
The results also showed that the problem for Latino adolescents may be two - fold .
At high levels of involvement in their religious community , Latino teens experienced the same tension between culture and society as some Asian - American teens .
This led to higher reports of depression symptoms among these youth .
But Latino teens who never attended church reported high levels of depression as well , reporting 26 to 28 percent higher rate of depression symptoms than did white and African - American American youth .
Religion is often an important part of social support for these adolescents and no involvement in their religion may leave these teens without a sense of connection to their community and culture , he said .
“ Participating to a certain extent may enable these youth to balance their lives better .
They have a connection with a religious community and all the benefits it offers , but they are not so immersed that they ’re out of touch with mainstream society .
So they ’re sort of getting the best of both worlds , ” Petts said .
The tension between society and religion may also help explain why females who were sexually active report higher levels of depression than do sexually active males .
The disconnect between how their religion told them to act and what they chose to do may cause these females to have higher emotional distress and increased depression , he said .
In addition , Latina females who participated heavily in their religion were more likely to become depressed then Latino males .
Not only were these young women more at risk for feeling depressed than were their male counterparts , but they were also more depressed then Latina females who attended church at intermittent levels .
“ Females in these religious institutions often have subordinate status and if females feel that they do n’t have equal say in that religious institution , that may contribute to higher levels of depression , ” Petts said .
This may also explain why attending church at intermediate levels resulted in lower depression for these females .
Latina females who attend at moderate levels may benefit from the social support of the religious community , while avoiding the patriarchal tensions experienced by those who attend services weekly .
( CNN ) -- Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama Tuesday proposed expanding federal deposit insurance for families and small businesses as a way to convince lawmakers who voted against the $ 700 billion federal bailout plan to change their minds .
" One step we could take to potentially broaden support for the legislation and shore up our economy would be to expand federal deposit insurance for families and small businesses across America who have invested their money in our banks .
" The majority of American families should rest assured that the deposits they have in our banks are safe , " Obama said in a statement put out by his presidential campaign .
" That is why today , I am proposing that we also raise the FDIC limit to $ 250,000 as part of the economic rescue package - a step that would boost small businesses , make our banking system more secure and help restore public confidence in our financial system . "
Currently , deposits of up to $ 100,000 are guaranteed by the government 's Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation .
Obama said he will talk to leaders and members of Congress later Tuesday to offer his idea and urge them to act without delay to pass a rescue plan .
Economic rescue package
Monday , the House of Representatives - defying leaders of both parties , the White House and both presidential nominees - voted down the economic rescue plan by 228 to 205 margin .
The Illinois senator urged lawmakers to try again on the bailout proposal and warned of grave consequences if nothing is done .
" Continued inaction in the face of the gathering storm in our financial markets would be catastrophic for our economy and our families .
At this moment , when the jobs , retirement savings and economic security of all Americans hang in the balance , it is imperative that all of us , Democrats and Republicans alike , come together to meet this crisis . "

THAT problem solving becomes easier when more minds are put to the task is no more than common sense .
But the phenomenon goes further than that .
Ask two people to answer a question like “ how many windows are there on a London double - decker bus ” and average their answers .
Their combined guesses will usually be more accurate than if just one person had been asked .
Ask a crowd , rather than a pair , and the average is often very close to the truth .
The phenomenon was called “ the wisdom of crowds ” by James Surowiecki , a columnist for the New Yorker who wrote a book about it .
Now a pair of psychologists have found an intriguing corollary .
They have discovered that two guesses made by the same person at different times are also better than one .
That is strange .
Until now , psychologists have assumed that when people make a guess , they make the most accurate guess that they can .
Ask them to make a second and it should , by definition , be less accurate .
If that were true , averaging the first and second guesses should decrease the accuracy .
Yet Edward Vul at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harold Pashler at the University of California , San Diego , have revealed in a study just published in Psychological Science that the average of first and second guesses is indeed better than either guess on its own .
The two researchers asked 428 people eight questions drawn from the “ CIA World Factbook ” : for example , “ What percentage of the world 's airports are in the USA ? ”
Half the participants were unexpectedly asked to make a second , different guess immediately after they completed the initial questionnaire .
The other half were asked to make a second guess three weeks later .
Dr Vul and Dr Pashler found that in both circumstances the average of the two guesses was better than either guess on its own .
They also noticed that the interval between the first and second guesses determined how accurate that average was .
Second guesses made immediately improved accuracy by an average of 6.5 % ; those made after three weeks improved the accuracy by 16 % .
Even after three weeks , the result is still only one - third as good as the wisdom of several different people .
But that this happens at all raises questions about “ individuality ” within an individual .
If guesses can shift almost at random , where are they coming from ?
One answer could be that they are evidence for the “ generate and test ” model of creative thinking .
This suggests that the brain is constantly creating hypotheses about the world and checking them against reality .
Those that pass muster are adopted .
Guessing the answers to questions you do not know the correct answer to , but have some idea of what the right answer ought to look like , could tap into such a system .
A hive mind buzzing with ideas , as it were , but inside a single skull .
BAGHDAD , July 27 ( UPI ) --
The power and influence of the Mehdi Army and its leader , radical Shiite cleric Moqtada Sadr , are waning in Iraq , local residents say .
In interviews with residents of the Mehdi Army 's stronghold , Baghdad 's Sadr City slum , The New York Times reported Sunday former supporters have switched allegiances to back sweeps by the U.S. military meant to dislodge Sadr 's support .

The newspaper said the reported shift would make permanent the writ of the national Iraqi government headed by Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki in areas formerly controlled by the Mehdi Army .
The Times said it reached its conclusions after conducting interviews with 17 Iraqis , including " municipal officials , gas station workers and residents , " who confirmed reports of Sadr 's slipping grip on the local economy , infrastructure and police .
If you getting tired of everytime have to clicking Start menu , and then click on Turn Off Computer , and then still have to click on Turn Off or Restart or Log Off in order to log off , restart or shut down your computer , and feel that it ’s time wasting , you can create a one - click shortcut that allows the user to shutdown or restart Windows , or go into standby or hibernate mode , with just a single click on the shortcut itself .
Best of all , the shortcut can be put at any place - desktop , Quick Launch bar , or Start Menu , and can even launch the shutdown or restart process from command line or command prompt .
In order to shutdown or restart the Windows with just one click shortcut or from command prompt or command line , users can use shutdown command line utility / command that comes with Windows 2000 ( with the Resource Kit installed ) and Windows XP or Windows Vista ( native ) .
To access shutdown command , simply go to DOS command prompt by clicking on Start -> All Programs -> Accessories -> Command Prompt or Start ->
Run and then type in Cmd to launch a command prompt window .
To create a one - click shortcut to shutdown the Windows computer , right click on your desktop or any folder ( or click at File at toolbar ) , and then select New , and then click on Shortcut .
A New Shortcut wizard will ask for location of this item .
In the textbox , type “ shutdown -s -t 01 ″ ( without quotation marks ) .
Click on Next when done .
When ask for a name for the shortcut , give any descriptive name you prefer , such as Shutdown .
Then click on Finish , and you can now use the shortcut created to shut down PC immediately after click .
If you want to create a shortcut that quick restart the Windows instead of shutting down the computer , follow the above instruction , but “ shutdown -s -t 01 ″ , key in “ shutdown -r -t 01 ″ for location of this item .
Again , give a proper descriptive name to the shortcut , such as Restart , and the shortcut is ready to be used to restart the Windows right after click .
As in the shutdown command above , -s parameter will shutdown the computer , while -r will shutdown and restart the computer .
-t 01 set the timeout or time to lapse in seconds for a shut down or restart to begin .
By default , if no -t argument is specified , shutdown command will wait for 30 seconds countdown before shutdown or restart .
The best part for shutdown command is that it can abort a system shutdown , by using - a as the option for shutdown , i.e. “ shutdown - a ” .
There are other options or parameters that available , and users can view all of the flags with “ shutdown /? ” command at command prompt .
The options available for shutdown are :
No arguments : Display this message ( same as -?)
- i : Display GUI interface , must be the first option
-l : Log off ( cannot be used with - m option )
-s : Shutdown the computer
-r : Shutdown and restart the computer
- a : Abort a system shutdown
-m \\computername : Remote computer to shutdown / restart / abort
-t xx :
Set timeout for shutdown to xx seconds
-c “ comment ” : Shutdown comment ( maximum of 127 characters )
-f : Forces running applications to close without warning
-d [ u ] [ p ] : xx:yy :
The reason code for the shutdown

10 Amazing Visualizations of Social Networks
Not Yet Squirrelly
Regarding my piece earlier this week regarding the striking improvement in JavaScript performance in the version of WebKit in the iPhone 2.0 update , one question I had was whether this was perhaps attributable to Apple having already switched to Squirrel Fish , the all - new JavaScript interpreter that the WebKit team unveiled in early June .
Announcing the project , Geoffrey Garen wrote :
SquirrelFish is fast — much faster than WebKit ’s previous interpreter .
Check out the numbers .
On the SunSpider JavaScript benchmark , Squirrel Fish is 1.6 times faster than WebKit ’s previous interpreter .
But it struck me as exceedingly unlikely that a project that new — having only been unveiled in June — would be included in the iPhone 2.0 OS .
And , as the benchmark results from the Squirrel Fish announcement show , version 3.1 of WebKit ’s old JavaScript interpreter is itself 2.7 times faster than version 3.0 .
WebKit ’s JavaScript performance had improved dramatically over the past year even before Squirrel Fish .
But I decided to check anyway .
When in doubt , look at the source , and the source code for JavaScriptCore is available from Apple ’s Darwin sources both for Mac OS X 10.5.4 ( which we know is n’t yet using Squirrel Fish ) and for iPhone OS 2.0 .
Running both source trees through BBEdit ’s Find Differences command shows that they ’re very similar — the JavaScript interpreter in iPhone OS 2.0 is nearly identical to the one in Safari 3.1.2 .
If you look at the source directory for the version of JavaScriptCore in the current WebKit trunk , which has switched to Squirrel Fish , you can see just by scanning the file names , let alone the source code , that much has changed .
One practical improvement in SquirrelFish over the previous WebKit interpreter is with regard to recursion depth .
( Recursion is when a function is written in such a way that it calls itself , sort of like the programming equivalent of nested Russian dolls .
See Wikipedia for more . )
WebKit ’s old JavaScript interpreter had a relatively shallow recursion limit of 499 ; recurse 500 times in your JavaScript code and you ’d get an exception .
Squirrel Fish supports far deeper recursion .
Here ’s a very simple test page to test how deep a JavaScript interpreter can recurse .
The entire source :
< script type =" text / javascript " > function recurse ( n ) { if ( n > 0 ) { return recurse(n - 1 ) ; } return 0 ; } try { // recurse ( 43687 ) ; //
Highest that works for me in WebKit // nightly builds as of 24 Jul 2008 . // recurse ( 2999 ) ; //
Highest that works for me in Firefox 3.0.1 // recurse ( 499 ) ; // Highest that works for me in Safari 3.1.2 recurse ( 3000 ) ; document.write ( " Could be SquirrelFish . " ) ; } catch(e ) { document .
write ( " Not SquirrelFish . " ) ; } </script >
It calls a simple recursive function 3000 times .
Pre -SquirrelFish versions of WebKit fail with any number higher than 499 .
Firefox 3.0.1 works up to 2,999 recursions .
A recent WebKit nightly , with Squirrel Fish , worked for me up to 43,687 , which is pretty deep .
MobileSafari in iPhone OS 2.0 has the same limit as Safari 3.1.2 : 499 .
Recursion depth , in and of itself , is n’t particularly important .
It ’s just a particularly simple way to distinguish pre- and post - Squirrel Fish versions of WebKit .
And so since we now know that the iPhone is n’t yet using Squirrel Fish , it means further dramatic performance improvements are on the horizon .
Dave Hermansen did not own a bird or a cage when he bought bird - cage.com , an online store , for $ 1,800 three years ago .
He simply saw a Web site that was “ very , very poorly done , ” and begged the owners to sell it to him .
He then redesigned the site , added advertising and drove up traffic .
Last December , he sold it for $ 173,000 .
Mr. Hermansen , 30 , is among the latest wave of entrepreneurs who , like the day traders and real estate investors before them , are looking to make a lot of money without much effort .
They use little more than home computers and free software to buy Web sites that appeal to a small and specific niche .
Then they fix up the sites with hopes of reselling them for far more than they paid .
But while their dreams are fueled by high - profile Internet deals  Condé Nast ’s $ 25 million purchase of Wired News , People.com ’s acquisition of Celebrity Baby Blog and , most recently , a deal this month between Guardian News and Media and the owner of PaidContent for a reported $ 30 million  these entrepreneurs have smaller ambitions for their sites .
Many end up settling for just hundreds , sometimes thousands of dollars .
Why have our summer cinema screens been ruled by the superhero ?
Are The Dark Knight and Iron Man really two of the most wonderful movies ever made , or is there something else going on that makes people even consider a movie like Hancock acceptable entertainment ?
The University of Wisconsin's Professor of Film Studies , David Bordwell , has some thoughts on the subject that he'd like to share .
One of the first things that Bordwell wants to establish is that , no , Iron Man and The Dark Knight were n't actually as good as you may have thought they were .
Instead , he suggests that society 's tastes are changing for multiple reasons , including ( but not limited to ) the increasing importance of special effects in movies , the shift away from auteur cinema towards franchises , a move from Westerns to Superheroes , and ... well , actors who love to over - act :
Today your serious actors shape - shift for every project - acquiring accents , burying their faces in makeup , gaining or losing weight .
We might be inclined to blame the Method , but classical actors went through the same discipline .
Olivier , with his false noses and endless vocal range , might be the impersonators ' patron saint .
His followers include Streep , Our Lady of Accents , and the self - flagellating young De Niro .
Ironically , although today 's performance - as - impersonation aims at greater naturalness , it projects a flamboyance that advertises its mechanics .
It can even look hammy .
Thus , as so often , does realism breed artifice .

Horror and comic - book movies offer ripe opportunities for this sort of masquerade .
In a straight drama , confined by realism , you usually can't go over the top , but given the role of Hannibal Lector , there is no top .
The awesome villain is a playground for the virtuoso , or the virtuoso in training .
You can overplay , underplay , or over - underplay ...
Such is the range we find in The Dark Knight ...
The Joker 's darting eyes , waggling brows , chortles , and restless licking of his lips send every bit of dialogue Special Delivery .
Ledger 's performance has been much praised , but what would count as a bad line reading here ?
The part seems designed for scenery - chewing .
By contrast , poor Bale has little to work with .
As Bruce Wayne , he must be stiff as a plank , kissing Rachel while keeping one hand suavely tucked in his pocket , GQ style .
In his Bat - cowl , he 's missing as much acreage of his face as Dent is , so all Bale has is the voice , over - underplayed as a hoarse bark .
In sum , our principals are sweating through their scenes .
You get no strokes for making it look easy , but if you work really hard you might get an Oscar .

In the end , Bordwell does n't come to any real conclusion , but claims to have found hope that interesting cinema can still exist within the superhero sphere in the form of Hellboy II .
Just do n't tell him that , thanks to BPRD , Lobster Johnson and Abe Sapien , Hellboy is just as much a franchise these days as Batman .

Troy King sworn in as Attorney General by Gov. Bob Riley as his wife Paige looks on …
A spokesperson for Alabama Governor Bob Riley denied that Attorney General Troy King is preparing to resign in the wake of a massive rumor campaign that has yet to be fully confirmed .
The word is , according to multiple sources in Montgomery and elsewhere , that King was recently caught by his wife in a gay affair with a male aide and banished from his home .
According to Tara Hutchison in the executive office of the governor they have heard of no plans in the works for King ’s resignation .
She said she had not heard that he had been kicked out of his home because of a gay affair .
Governor Bob Riley ’s press office had refused to return multiple phone calls from this independent press outlet even though some sources accuse Riley of perpetrating the leak .
The attorney general ’s press office also declined to return phone calls seeking comment .
The Locust Fork News and Journal heard about this a couple of weeks ago from a Montgomery lawyer , and have had numerous contacts with people trying to confirm the truth of the rumor .
Troy Robin King , according to his profile on Wikipedia , previously served as an Assistant Attorney General .
He was appointed by Governor Bob Riley in 2004 , when William Pryor resigned to accept a federal judgeship on an appointment from President George W. Bushy .
He then defeated Mobile County District Attorney John Tyson , Jr. in the 2006 election by a margin of 54 - 46 percent .
King was born on August 22 , 1968 , in Elba , Alabama .
He is currently married to Paige King with whom he has three children ; Briggs , Colden , and Asher .
He is a Baptist .
King received his undergraduate degree from Troy University and is a 1994 graduate of the University of Alabama law school .
During the 2005 legislative session , King made headlines by wearing an electronic monitoring bracelet of the kind used by parolees and others under judicial monitoring .
King promised to wear the bracelet until the legislature passed tougher monitoring laws for parolees and convicted sex offenders , and removed it when such laws were passed .
King has made opposition to gambling a central theme of his administration .
In 2006 , King asked the United States Department of the Interior to deny an application by the Poarch Creek Band of Indians to expand their gaming operations in Alabama .
King later filed a lawsuit against the Department to keep it from pressuring Alabama to permit video gaming on Alabama reservations .
King is also a staunch proponent of the death penalty , a position that has subjected him to criticism from death penalty opponents .
When many states voluntarily suspended executions during U.S. Supreme Court litigation over lethal injection , King continued to seek the setting of execution dates in Alabama .
King ’s support of the death penalty created a controversy when , in 2007 , a district attorney in suburban Birmingham supported commutation of the death sentence of an accomplice , in a case where the actual shooter had escaped the death penalty because he was a juvenile .
King sought to block the district attorney ’s testimony to that effect , and criticized the district attorney .
The incident led a wide , bipartisan coalition of local district attorneys , as well as newspaper editorials , to criticize King .
In late 2006 , King was forced to recuse his entire office from the ongoing investigation of abuses in the Alabama community college system , when it emerged that he had asked community college chancellor Roy Johnson to hire the mother of one of King ’s employees .
This request was made while King knew Johnson to be a target of the ongoing investigation .
It later emerged that King had , also during the investigation , asked Johnson for community college system financial support for Victims of Crime and Leniency , an advocacy group politically supportive of King .
The investigation eventually resulted in a guilty plea by Johnson in the related federal investigation .
In early 2007 , an investigation revealed that King had accepted free tickets , food , and skybox access to an Atlanta Braves baseball game from Alabama Power Company the preceding season .
Alabama Power had not reported the gifts to appropriate ethics agencies as required , until contacted by a local newspaper .
King attended the game in question with his family and family friends .
The food bill for the outing was over $ 1,200 , and the skybox normally rented for $ 2,400 a day .
Because King , as Attorney General , was legally responsible for representing Alabama Power customers before the Alabama Public Service Commission and other agencies , he was widely criticized for accepting the gifts .
King reimbursed Alabama Power for $ 486 for his family ’s food , but did not reimburse it for food eaten by his family ’s guests .
King denied wrongdoing in the matter .
Later in 2007 , Anthony Castaldo , formerly an investigator with the Attorney General ’s office , submitted an affidavit stating that King had ordered him to investigate a Birmingham - area judge for political reasons , and later punished Castaldo when a year - long investigation showed no evidence of wrongdoing .
After other investigators took over the case , King secured an indictment against the judge , but the charges were later dismissed .
King was an early supporter of the 2008 presidential campaign of Arizona Senator John McCain .
King ’s name had been mentioned as a possible gubernatorial candidate in 2010 , but we suppose that ’s out now …
King was also known for his fight against the sex toy shops in Montgomery .
Looks like Shakespeare was right … whoever cries the loudest …

10 Electric Cars You Can Buy Today
The internet is abuzz with news of new electric cars that all seem to be coming out in 2010 .
It seems like every day we hear more about the Chevy Volt “ extended range electric vehicle , ” but not so much about what ’s available right now .
If you ’ve got an itchy trigger finger and a hefty wallet , there are a few options for you right now .
Who Sells the Electric Cars ?
1. Zap
Model : Xebra
Price : $ 11,700
Top Speed / Range : 40 mph / 25 miles
Everyone was a little skeptical of Zap after Wired went and exposed a lot of shady doings over there .
I wo n’t say that I ’m any less skeptical now , but a forum member took the plunge and actually bought a Zap Xebra .
His reports are interesting , and he seems to like the car , even though the government might not be so fond of it .
Zap ’s three - wheeled electric “ cars ” fall into that gray area where they ’ve tried to register them as motorcycles to bypass safety regulations , but the government is starting to say “ hold on , that ’s no motorcycle ! ”
Definitely check your local laws on these vehicles before taking the plunge .
2. Commuter Cars
Model : Tango
Price : $ 108,000
Top Speed / Range : 150 mph / 200 miles ( with Lithium Ion batteries )
The Tango T600 is the like the Tesla Roadster ’s slightly odd cousin .
At first you think “ oh , that ’s weird , ” until you realize that you ’ve fallen in love and are getting married .
That kind of what my experience looking at this car was .
At first I wondered if someone had chopped a Smart ForTwo in half in order to be ironic about how small it was , then I realized this little sucker is extremely light , compact , and can do 0 - 60 in a very respectable 4 seconds .
It ’s certainly not cheap , but it ’s the ultimate pocket racer if you really want to surprise the competition .
3. Dynasty Electric Car Corp .
Model : IT SEDAN
Price : $ 19,000
Top Speed / Range : 24 mph / 30 miles
The IT sedan is what ’s known as a neighborhood electric vehicle ( NEV ) , meaning that it is speed regulated to about 25 mph , even though it might be able to go faster .
In some places , these are illegal because of the low top speeds , so if you ’re looking into one you should check out local laws .
There are however , good for putzing around town , if you live in that kind of area .
4. GEM
Model : e2
Price : $ 6,795
Top Speed / Range : 25 mph / 35 miles
Most people , myself included , are shocked to hear that Chrysler owns an electric car company , but once you scratch the surface , it becomes obvious that GEM ’s NEVs are more like glorified golf carts than anything that could be morphed into a production electric car .
Now , this is n’t an insult to NEVs , but you can tell by the fact that GEM ’s vehicles cost thousands less than electric cars from companies like Dynasty ’s that they ’re not meant to be much more .
If you ’re looking to cruise around your country club estate in eco-style , this NEV might be for you .
5. TWIKE
Model : TWIKE
Price : $ 35,000
Top Speed / Range : 53 mph / 100 miles
The TWIKE , as a human - electric hybrid is sort of in a class of its own .
It can run entirely on electric power , but using pedals inside the vehicle , both the driver and the passenger can pedal to help charge the battery and extend the range .
I got to see one of these this year at HybridFest , and even though it looks pretty cool , I ’d be scared to take it out anywhere where I would be nearing the max speed .
40 mph , maybe .
But not 50 mph .
Also , a starting price of $ 35 k makes it a bit cost prohibitive , even though it ’s very well made .
6. REVA
httpv://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1sFTosNNOpc
Model : Standard
Price : $ 16,000
Top Speed / Range : 45 mph / 70 miles
The REVA , or the G - Wiz , as it ’s known in the UK is the much mocked and sometimes loved electric car from India .
Watch Top Gear for more humourous commentary .
7. Myers
Model : NmG
Price : $ 35,000
Top Speed / Range : 75 mph / 30 miles
The NmG stands for “ no more gas , ” and it ’s another one of those vehicles I had the pleasure of seeing at hybrid fest .
It ’s a small and incredibly aerodynamic vehicle , but it only seats the driver and ca n’t take on much cargo .
However , the aerodynamics allow the NmG to reach decently high speeds and it seems like a reasonably fun ride for less than the $ 100 k price tags on the Tango or Telsa Roadster .
8. ZENN
Model : ZENN NEV
Price : $ 12,000
Top Speed / Range : 25 mph / 35 miles
ZENN is Canada ’s own NEV maker , but recently they ’ve battled the government over the basic legality of NEVs on Canada ’s roads .
ZENN , like other NEV makers , produces electric cars that are n’t meant to do much more than run around on local streets .
However , unlike GEM ’s cars , they are a bit more substantial , but also a little cheaper than Dynasty ’s cars .

THOUGHTS ON THE TOILET - BUT NOT FROM IT
The concept of a washroom , it recently dawned on me , is entirely a strange one .
In all our superiority over the other animals , in all our technolog ... more ...
An adult froghopper ( Aphrophora alni ) reaches a body length of under a half inch ( 9 mm ) and can jump to heights of 28 inches ( 700 mm ) .
Lickety - split , insects called froghoppers can leap a distance of 100 times their body length .
Now , scientists have found the bugs ' secret :
They sport bow - like structures that work like catapults .
Froghoppers are also called spittlebugs because the nymph stage of these insects produces a frothy sap for protection .
The adults store energy in a pair of bow - shaped structures made of both a hard cuticle material and a rubbery protein called resilin , new research found .
The structures are attached to the hind legs .
When the insect contracts its muscles to jump , these structures flex like an archery bow .
Upon recoil , the " bow " sends the insect forward with a force that can reach more than 400 times its body mass .
Since the hopper 's arching device is made of both hard and elastic materials , it can resist damage even if bent for a long time .
In fact , froghoppers hold their bows in a ready position so they are prepared to leap at a moment 's notice .
They can also jump repeatedly without damaging the body , the researchers say .
As nymphs , froghoppers lack the elastic protein in their bow structures .
And as expected , the little ones do n't jump until they develop into adults .
The finding is published today in the journal BMC Biology .
The Republican political party of USAmerica controlled both houses of Congress for the whole decade preceding the Great Depression of the 20th century .
They also held the Presidency during these years .
They pushed tariffs to an all time high , often looked the other way as big business commited violations of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act and market competition within the USA waned , and made tax cuts which benefited the wealthy .
It was after all this that the Great Depression took place , lasting for many years .

The enormous hidden costs to society of ' right - wing ' political governance
" As for the catastrophe itself catching up to you [ Republicans ] , major disasters of the sort you arrange usually take a while to actually come to fruition ( the Great Depression required perhaps ten years of concerted effort ) ...
... so by that time you should have successfully diverted $ trillions in tax payer monies to your friends , family , and political donors by various channels , as well as made good on your own escape from office , leaving the horrific mess for others to clean up for years -- maybe even decades -- to come .
You should also be reassured by US history , which shows top politicians and major political parties pay for their crimes even more rarely ( and with smaller penalties ) than top US business executives and corporations .
After all , the only punishment meted out to the Republican party responsible for the Great Depression of the 1920s was a US electorate unwilling to trust them with majority control of all three branches of US government simultaneously for such a lengthy period again , for many decades .
By contrast , Germany permanently banned from existence its own right - wing political party which so decimated it and the world during the same period .
Perhaps the closest thing to predictability in American criminal sentencing today is that the rich or powerful who steal millions or billions of dollars , or harm thousands or millions by their actions or inactions , usually get far lighter punishment ( if any ) than poor whites or blacks or other disadvantaged citizens involved in crimes which are trivial by comparison .
" Criminal prosecutions are highly unusual for corporate criminals , and convictions carrying jail time are even more rare . " --

But exactly how could someone preserve the status quo in today 's world ?
The enormous hidden costs to society of ' right - wing ' political governance
A secret ecovillage that was only discovered during an aerial survey of a Welsh national park will not be demolished after it was finally approved .
After a 10 - year planning row , authorities at Brithdir Mawr , in Pembrokeshire , ruled that the settlement - made up of timber - framed , turf - roofed roundhouses resembling Bilbo Baggins ' home in the Lord of the Rings - could stay .
The inhabitants secretly built the sustainable village and lived there unnoticed until the aerial survey was carried out in 1998 .
The villagers were threatened with eviction and the authorities said the roundhouses , built of straw , timber , recycled glass , clay and manure , must be torn down .
However , the villagers fought back and , after a decade of hearings , court cases and inquiries , the settlement has been saved from destruction .
The village relies on solar power and a wind turbine for electricity , and has compost toilets , reed beds , a workshop and a hay barn .
Water is collected locally , and the villagers survive by working the land and carrying out craft industries such as woodcarving .
The Pembrokeshire coast national park authority gave the village the green light after it adopted a new policy on sustainable , low - impact developments .
A spokeswoman said that meant the community would have to make a " positive environmental and social / economic contribution to the area " .
" It was pleasing that support could be given at this stage for this longstanding , complicated case , " she said .
The national park authority will review the decision in three years .
If many voters are fuzzy on the events that over the weekend forced Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. into bankruptcy and Merrill Lynch & Company to be swallowed by the Bank of America Corporation , the continuing chaos among the most venerable names in American finance — coming on top of the recent government seizure of mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and the demise of the Bear Stearns Companies — has stoked their anxiety for the economy , the foremost issue on voters ’ minds .
So it was that first Mr. Obama and then Mr. McCain rushed out their statements on Monday morning before most Americans had reached their workplaces .
To the extent that travails on Wall Street and Main Street have both corporations and homeowners looking to Washington for a hand , that helps Mr. Obama and his fellow Democrats who see government as a force for good and business regulation as essential .
Yet Mr. McCain has sold himself to many voters as an agent for change , despite his party ’s unpopularity after years of dominating in Washington , and despite his own antiregulation stances of past years .
Mr. McCain was quick on Monday to issue a statement calling for “ major reform ” to “ replace the outdated and ineffective patchwork quilt of regulatory oversight in Washington and bring transparency and accountability to Wall Street . ”
Later his campaign unveiled a television advertisement called “ Crisis , ” that began : “ Our economy in crisis .
Only proven reformers John McCain and Sarah Palin can fix it .
Tougher rules on Wall Street to protect your life savings . ”
Mr. McCain ’s reaction suggests how the pendulum has swung to cast government regulation in a more favorable political light as the economy has suffered additional blows and how he is scrambling to adjust .
While he has few footprints on economic issues in more than a quarter century in Congress , Mr. McCain has always been in his party ’s mainstream on the issue .
In early 1995 , after Republicans had taken control of Congress , Mr. McCain promoted a moratorium on federal regulations of all kinds .
He was quoted as saying that excessive regulations were “ destroying the American family , the American dream ” and voters “ want these regulations stopped . ”
The moratorium measure was unsuccessful .
“ I ’m always for less regulation , ” he told The Wall Street Journal last March , “ but I am aware of the view that there is a need for government oversight ” in situations like the subprime lending crisis , the problem that has cascaded through Wall Street this year .
He concluded , “ but I am fundamentally a deregulator . ”

Police fire rubber bullets at protesters at the Republican National Convention , St. Paul , Minn. , September 1 , 2008
They 're rounding up journalists now .
Covering breaking news has always been a Constitutionally protected activity in the United States .
The Bush administration , however , seems intent on changing the rules -- or at least in seeing how far the government can push its police state mentality and get away with it .
You'd think the mainstream media would be all over a story like this .
But so far , the biggest media outlets have been eerily silent .
Dozens of journalists , photographers , bloggers and videomakers have been arrested in an orchestrated round up of independents covering the Republican National Convention .
Journalists covering protests have been pointed out by authorities , blasted with tear gas and pepper spray , and brutalized while in custody .

Lest the mainstream media think this can't happen to them , and in what may be a tipping point , mainstream journalists such as photographer Matt Rourke of the Associated Press have found out that even they are n't immune to the brutal and indiscriminate tactics of the police in suppressing dissent .
Rourke was doused with pepper spray , knocked down and arrested by St. Paul police .
He was shooting photos of the protesters at a parking lot at 7th and Jackson streets , in downtown St. Paul , when police converged from three directions .
" We were encircled , and as I moved toward the officers in front of me in a passive manner , my legs were taken out from behind in an aggressive manner , " Rourke said Tuesday after 12 hours in jail .
" When you hear about journalists getting arrested , it ’s very disturbing , " said Congressman Keith Ellison ( D - Minn . )
" I mean , the news gatherers — how can the people know , if they do n’t have news gatherers to gather the news and show them ?
But when those folks are being intimidated and even roughed up , it ’s pretty — it actually is a threat to democracy and the First Amendment . "
On Monday and Tuesday , officers in riot gear fired rubber bullets , teargas , pepper spray and concussion grenades at protesters and journalists covering the story in St. Paul near the convention .
Fox News host Brian Kilmeade , predictably , expressed the opinion that the protesters should be arrested and left in jail .
It 's no surprise that Fox failed to distinguish between the great majority of peaceful , non-violent protesters and the actions of a few -- quite possibly government - planted agents provocateurs -- who broke storefront windows and engaged in other acts of vandalism .
Kilmeade and his " fair and balanced "
Fox colleagues ignored brutal police tactics and indiscriminate arrests directed against peaceful protesters and journalists .
According to journalist Amy Goodman of Democracy Now , police in the Twin Cities arrested nearly 300 protesters , as well as several journalists covering the protest , on Monday .
" I was arrested along with two producers from Democracy Now ! : Sharif Abdel Kouddous and Nicole Salazar , " Goodman said .
" Also arrested , Associated Press photographer Matt Rourke and two filmmakers from Pepperspray Productions , Lambert Rochfort and Joseph La Sac . "

Internet users will be able to choose their favourite nun from photographs
An Italian priest says he is organising the world 's first beauty pageant for nuns to erase a stereotype of them as being old and dour .
Antonio Rungi says The Miss Sister Italy online contest will start on his blog in September .
" Nuns are - above all - women , and beauty is a gift from God , " he told Italy 's Corriere della Sera newspaper .
He is asking nuns to send their photos to him , saying that internet users will then choose the winner .
Father Rungi stressed that nuns were not being invited to parade in bathing suits , saying it will be up to them whether they pose with the traditional veil or with their heads uncovered .
" This contest will be a way to show there is n't just the beauty we see on television but also a more discreet charm , " the priest , who lives near the southern city of Naples , told the Corriere della Sera .
" You really think all nuns are old , stunted and sad ?
This is n't the case anymore , " he said , pointing out that many young nuns had arrived to Italy from around the world .
He added that the idea of staging such a contest had been suggested by nuns themselves .

It did n’t make the news , at least not the corporate news .
According to Bob Feuer , Bush will attack Iran , declare martial law , and suspend the election .
Congress critter John
Olver apparently made this claim at a town hall meeting at the Jones Library in Amherst , Massachusetts , last July .
Feuer , a lawyer and political activist challenging Olver in the 1st Congressional District of Massachusetts , was at the town hall meeting with others to present Olver with resolutions to impeach Bush for war crimes when Olver made the comments .
On July 5 , 2007 , the After Downing Street website posted Feuer ’s retelling of the incident :
At about 10 am , the congressman came into the room with his aid , and Susie Patlove welcomed the congressman , laid out our agenda , and the congressman approved .
We commenced with individual introductions and brief reports on the outcomes in each of our towns .
Cong .
Olver asked us to spare him a review of what he already knew and believed about the crimes of the Bush administration , and of the overwhelming majority of his district in favor of impeachment .
When he aggrandized himself on his voting record , I took exception to 24 April 2007 .
When he asked what I was referring to , I challenged him to co-sponsor H. Res. 333 ; and he emphatically refused .
Nonetheless , we informed him of the good that would come out of an impeachment , and gave intelligent and caring answers to all of the objections he might harbor .
We had present a young U.S. soldier , a veteran of both the Iraq and Afghanistan occupations , who directly asked the congressman what could we do to move him towards co-signing H. Res .
333 .
The congressman did not answer that direct question .
He is deeply concerned whether we will actually have an election in Nov. ’ 08 , as he believes this administration will likely strike Iran from the air , declare a national emergency , and cancel the ’08 elections .
He sees ending the war as his primary goal , and he believes the brilliant Nancy Pelosi [ sic ] has a strategy more potent than impeachment .
He thinks impeachment is a futile waste of legislative energy , will be harmful of democratic ’08 victories , and further tighten the “ gridlock ” he has complained of for the past few decades .
Olver would later deny he said this and would insist he was misquoted .
Not a word appeared in the corporate media , even though Olver has been a Democratic member of the United States House of Representatives since 1991 .
But then , of course , the corporate media is in bed with the neocons and wholly complicit in their plans to reduce Muslim and Arab countries to smoldering cinders .
Last time around , neocon operative Judith Miller was allowed to publish all sorts of lies about Iraq in the “ liberal ” New York Times .
Silence this time around should be expected .
Feuer ’s claim is especially pertinent now as Dennis Kucinich attempts to get Bush impeached and rumblings about an attack against Iran pick up speed .
The election is but a mere four months away and if Olver is correct —
Bush will attack Iran , suspend the election , and declare martial law — this will have to go down in the next couple months or so .
Bush and the neocons have installed their repressive legislation and directives — PDD51 , the Military Commissions Act , and the John Warner Defense Authorization Act , all designed to silence the opposition and “ enforce acquiescence at home , ” as the Episcopal priest and activist Frank Morales notes .
Only time will tell if this scenario will actually occur .
If it does , we can expect the corporate media to remain silent on the rendition of activists to those brand spanking new Halliburton concentration camps , as fascists always sweep up and do away with the opposition .

By ptesone at 2005 - 08 - 30 14:58 here 's 6 basic steps to convert a .AVI to DVD so you can watch your movies on your home player , not just your computer .
. . But first we need to figure out if it's a fullscreen movie or letterbox movie .
. . Movies normally come in two sizes : 4:3 ( fullscreen ) or 16:9 ( letterbox ) which they call aspect ratio . . . They also come in two formats PAL ( Non-US ) and NTSC ( US ) . . . The following examples are for NTSC Only !
what you need first :
transcode
mplayer
Mjpegtools
ffmpeg
dvd+rw - tools
Dvdauthor
some hardrive space
in this example I will be using a 16:9 movie.avi for our conversion . . .
1. ) Split the .avi file into 2 separate files , one for video and one for audio :
Code : transcode - i movie.avi -y ffmpeg -- export_prof dvd-ntsc -- export_asr 3 - o movie - D0 - s2 -m movie.ac3 - J modfps=clonetype=3 -- export_fps 29.97
movie.m2v ( video )
movie.ac3 ( audio )
note : if you 're doing a fullscreen ( 4:3 ) movie then simply change -- export_asr 3 to -- export_asr 2
2. ) ( optional ) Extract 5.1 Audio :
Code : tcextract - d2 - i movie.avi - a0 -x ac3 | tcextract - d2 -x ac3 - t raw > movie.ac3
How can you tell ?
Do this first :
Code : mplayer - vo dummy - identify movie.avi 2 > / dev / null | grep " 5.1 ( "
Code : AC3 : 5.1 ( 3f+2r+lfe ) 48000 Hz 384.0 kbit/s
3. ) Put the video & audio file back together :
Code : mplex -f 8 -o dvd_movie.mpg movie.m2v movie.ac3
4. ) open your favorite text editor and paste the following :
Code : < dvdauthor dest = " DVD " > < vmgm /> < titleset > < titles > < pgc > < vob file =" dvd_movie.mpg " chapters = " 0,15:00,30:00,45:00,1:00:00 " /> </ pgc> </titles > </ titleset > </ dvdauthor >
in the same directory as your movie files
( you can also change the chapters to fit the times of your movie )
5. ) Create a DVD directory where your movie files are and do this :
Code : dvdauthor -x dvdauthor.xml
6. ) Test it & Burn it :
to test it :
Code : xine dvd:/ full / path/to/DVD/VIDEO_TS/
Code : growisofs - Z / dev/dvd - dvd-video DVD /
If all goes well , the above will produce movie with no menus , just the movie that should play when you put in your disc . . . and if there 's more than one .avi then simply do this in your dvdauthor.xml file :
Code : < dvdauthor dest = " DVD " > < vmgm /> < titleset > < titles > < pgc > < vob file =" dvd_movie_part1.mpg " chapters = " 0,15:00,30:00,45:00,1:00:00 " /> </ pgc> < pgc > < vob file =" dvd_movie_part2.mpg " chapters = " 0,15:00,30:00,45:00,1:00:00 " /> </ pgc> </titles > </ titleset > </ dvdauthor >
GOOD LUCK !

Gallup Daily : McCain's Bounce Gives Him 5 - Point Lead Leads Obama 49 % - 44 % in first results conducted fully after GOP convention
PRINCETON , NJ -- John McCain leads Barack Obama , 49 % to 44 % , in the immediate aftermath of the Republican National Convention , according to the latest Gallup Poll Daily tracking results .
These results are based on Sept. 5 - 7 interviewing , and are the first in which all interviews were conducted following the completion of the GOP convention .
Immediately prior to the convention 's Sept. 1 start , Aug. 29-31 interviewing showed McCain with 43 % support among registered voters , compared with 49 % today .
Thus , Gallup credits McCain with a six - point convention bounce .
That is slightly better than Barack Obama 's four - point bounce from 45 % in Aug. 22 - 24 polling before the Democratic National Convention started to 49 % immediately after it concluded .
Since 1964 , the typical convention bounce has been five percentage points .
Here is how the candidates ' convention bounces compare with prior presidential candidates .
The net effect of the GOP convention bounce is that McCain has moved from a trailing position as the convention was getting underway ( 49 % Obama , 43 % McCain ) to a leading position ( 49 % McCain , 44 % Obama ) .
McCain 's current 49 % share of the vote is his best performance in Gallup tracking to date .
His five - point lead is his best since early May , when he led Obama by six points ( 48 % to 42 % ) .
Obama has led throughout much of the campaign , and has led nearly all of the time since he clinched the Democratic nomination in early June .
( To view the complete trend since March 7 , 2008 , click here . )
McCain has led Obama in each of the three individual nights ' data comprising today 's three - day rolling average , but the real question is whether he can sustain the lead as voter excitement around the convention fades .
Since 1964 , the first election year for which Gallup could reliably measure convention bounces , there have been only two examples in which one candidate consistently trailed until the time of his party 's convention , but took the lead after and never relinquished it .
Those occurred in 1988 for the elder George Bush and 1992 for Bill Clinton .
But there are also examples where a consistently trailing candidate took the lead after his party 's convention , but later relinquished it -- Jimmy Carter in 1980 and Al Gore in 2000 .
The most common pattern has been for one candidate to consistently lead prior to both conventions , and to maintain a lead during the convention period , even if his opponent got a convention bounce .
There is potential for further movement in the campaign , most notably with three presidential debates and one vice presidential debate scheduled for late September through mid-October , in addition to the intensive day - to - day campaigning between now and Election Day .
-- Jeff Jones
Survey Methods
For the Gallup Poll Daily tracking survey , Gallup is interviewing no fewer than 1,000 U.S. adults nationwide each day during 2008 .
The general - election results are based on combined data from Sept. 5 - 7 , 2008 .
For results based on this sample of 2,733 registered voters , the maximum margin of sampling error is ±2 percentage points .
Interviews are conducted with respondents on land - line telephones ( for respondents with a land - line telephone ) and cellular phones ( for respondents who are cell - phone only ) .
In addition to sampling error , question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls .

ATI launched its new , ultra budget - oriented HD 4550 and HD 4350 card series Tuesday , completing its transition from the HD 3000 to HD 4000 lineup .
The company now offers a complete line of HD 4000 cards at all price points .
At $ 49 ( Radeon HD 4550 ) and $ 39 ( Radeon HD 4350 ) , ATI is primarily aiming at customers who either game or are looking to build an HTPC system .
Users who simply need a second or third video card or who want a card that supports DisplayPort could also benefit from the new series , but are not directly targeted as such .
Even given such modest features , AMD still hopes to persuade the market that it offers a more compelling part than NVIDIA , but consumers may scarcely be aware of the difference .
The Radeon HD 4550 will retail for $ 45 or $ 55 , presumably depending on whether you spring for the 256MB or 512 MB options .
Both the 4550 and 4350 cards will carry 80 stream processors .
That 's fairly anemic compared to even the HD 4650 , but it 's still a 2 x jump over the 40 SPUs previously offered on last generation 's 3450 and 3470 .
The 4550 and 4350 carry the same number of SP units ( 80 ) , texture units ( 8 ) , and ROPs ( 4 ) .
Core clock is identical , at 600MHz , and both cards use a 64 - bit memory bus .
The difference , therefore , is centered solely around the amount of available RAM and that RAM 's clockspeed .
The ATI HD 4550 utilizes 800MHz DDR3 , while the 4350 will run at 500MHz and use DDR2 .
The ATI 4550 's 512MB version is passively cooled .
Both cards focus on overall utility more than performance , though ATI serves up the usual helping of benchmarks that show it out in front of Team Green .
Whichever cheeky little monkey slipped in a note about the HD 4550 offering more features than the GTX 280 deserves a banner inscribed with " Failed marketing BS of the year , " but these new HD 4000 solutions do offer a solid array of capabilities , especially considering their sub - $ 60 price point .
There 's marketing , and then there 's just plain stupid .
Seriously , who thought this was a good idea ?
As you can see , the HD 4550 is marketed as a passively cooled single - slot solution and requires no dedicated power connector ; maximum board power draw is estimated at 20 W and should be considerably lower in any real - world scenario .
All of the standard UVD2 features are included on both cards , including dual - stream hardware decoding , DVD upscaling , support for eight - channel HD audio , and an HDMI - DVI adapter .
The 512MB version of the HD 4550 will ship with DVI , HDMI , and DP ( DisplayPort ) connection options , while the 256MB card will carry DVI , VGA , and TV - out via SVIDEO .
ATI says the HD 4350 will also be available
in a passively cooled solution
The HD 4350 will be available in both active and passively cooled configurations and uses a low - profile design .
This might seem a minor point , but low - profile slots are often popular on HTPC - style cases , and ATI is clearly trying to hook this market .
The low - profile product mix below $ 40 is an eclectic group of cards from multiple generations .
NVIDIA 's GeForce 7200 GS , GeForce FX 5200 , MX 4000 , and 8400 GS all make appearances here , while a single Gigabyte ATI HD 3450 stands guard over the $ 39.99 price point .
Clearly ATI could gain some ground here , and profits are profits , however marginal .
We 've heard from a number of readers that they 'd appreciate current - generation versions of ATI cards on the AGP , PCIe x1 , or even PCI busses , as well as calls for low - profile versions of such cards , but there is no word from ATI on which of these combinations — if any — they might choose to support .
On a completely random note , I was quite surprised to see a low - profile 512MB GeForce 9600 GT at $ 129 .
It 's not the cheapest 9600 GT on the market , but the $ 20 or so premium for its low - profile status is , uh , pretty low .
I 'm including a mention of it here because it's far faster and more capable than any of the other low - profile cards currently up and Newegg — anyone wanting to game but stuck in a limited box should give it a look .
Back we go to ATI , where these cards should match any wishlist an HTPC builder or user can dream up .
As for gaming , Anandtech took these cards for a quick drive in both Crysis and Oblivion , and came back with unsurprising results .
Yes , you can technically game on these cards , and yes , they 're leagues above integrated graphics , including AMD 's 780G ( though that board remains on top as far as integrated solutions are concerned ) .
When we ( or Anand ) say game , however , we mean " game at minimum resolutions with everything off . "
Turn up the resolution or detail levels even slightly , and Anand finds that NVIDIA 's 9500 GT becomes a significantly better option — though that card , in turn , is vastly superseded by the ATI HD 4670 .
As for CPU usage when decoding DVD or HD video streams , there 's little reason to think these budget models would show different results from their big brothers .
As we 've seen in other reviews , video cards outfitted with the same hardware offload technology tend to perform identically , even if they differ significantly in all other respects .
Conclusion
If you 're in the market for an excellent HTPC solution , these two new cards pack all the goodies , keep the price low , and perhaps most importantly , are available in at least one fanless configuration .
If , on the other hand , you 're looking for a budget gaming solution , I 'd honestly suggest you look elsewhere .
64 - bit memory busses were considered a limiting factor back in 2002 , to say nothing of today .
That 's not something that will impact the card 's ability to drive a DisplayPort , decode HD video streams , or display a decent desktop or two , but it does mean that these two cards are both out of their league when evaluated as gaming solutions .
Gaming , however , is just one reason why people buy video cards , especially cheap ones .
ATI appears to have hit every other market aspect dead on — now how long before we can buy a motherboard ( or CPU ) with an integrated 4350 ?
The McCain campaign can’t have it both ways .
If the US ambassador is now saying that it was “ prudent ” for John McCain to not commit to meeting with the Spanish prime minister should McCain win the election , then it must have been awfully “ imprudent ” for McCain to invite the Spanish leader to Washington back in April .
McCain just keeps digging himself in deeper and deeper .
McCain would rather tell a lie , and rupture relations with a top US ally , than admit the damaging truth that he no longer has the mental acuity he did in his youth .
But hey , I ’m game .
Let ’s play along .
Do tell us , McCain campaign :
What was it between April and today that convinced John McCain that he needed to take a hard line with the Spanish , 6 weeks before the US election , contradicting everything McCain said about relations with Spain only five months ago ?
Seriously , let ’s play this game – answer the question and convince us that John McCain did n’t just suffer a mental lapse on tape .
One more point , for our friends in the corporate media .
The fact that McCain is now dragging in the Bush administration to defend him on this issue means that McCain is very worried that this issue will get traction .
Why ?
Not because he ’s worried about the all - important Spaniard vote – no offense to our Spanish friends , but American voters really do n’t care if McCain disses Spain .
There has to be some reason that the McCain campaign is having the Bush administration weigh in to save him on this one .
McCain is worried that we got a very real glimpse of him seemingly showing signs of old age or illness .
McCain is 72 years old and has had 4 bouts of serious melanoma .
It ’s time the media stopped beating around the bush .
Everyone knows McCain is n’t as intellectually spry as he once was .
These mistakes are happening more frequently .
What if they happen during an international crisis ?
We ’ll have Sarah Palin to help him out ?
Iceland has just bailed out Glitnir Bank , with the government putting in 600 million euros — $ 859 million — in return for a 75 % stake .
Iceland has only a bit more than 300,000 people , about 1/1000th the population of the United States .
So this was , per capita , the equivalent of an $ 850 billion bailout here .
Notice , by the way , that it was an equity injection rather than a purchase of bad debt ; I approve .
The agency has long had the authority to revoke the tax - exempt status of religious and charitable groups  known as 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) organizations under a law passed in 1954  if they participate in “ activities that favor or oppose one or more candidates for public office . ”
Typically , it does not initiate investigations but acts on complaints from individuals or groups like Americans United , which filed the complaint against Mr. Manning .
Investigations can take years , in part because of the process of deposition - taking and verification , and in part , experts say , because of a sensitivity to the special role of religious freedom in the country ’s history .
Only a handful of churches have ever lost their tax exemptions , and then only temporarily .
It is unclear whether the accessibility of evidence on the Internet will produce more or speedier investigations .
So far this year , the rate of new cases the revenue agency has pursued roughly matches that in the campaign years of 2004 and 2006  when there were about 100 annually , according to Nancy Mathis , an agency spokeswoman .
But even though many churches and charity groups have had Web sites for years , the agency issued its first guidelines on the matter in June 2007 .
In a memo to enforcement officers posted on its Web site , which many tax - exempt groups monitor , the I.R.S. said that if “ a 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) organization posts something on its
Web site that favors or opposes a candidate for public office , the organization will be treated the same as if it distributed printed material , oral statements or broadcasts that favored or opposed a candidate . ”
Several clarifying guidelines were issued last month .
Since the early 1990s , when the revenue service imposed severe penalties in several high - profile cases , including a two - year revocation of the tax exemption for Jerry Falwell ’s “ Old Time Gospel Hour , ” most religious organizations and clergy members have been careful to keep within the I.R.S. limits .
To explain the latest changes , many religious groups have held online seminars , or Webinars .
The liberal - leaning Interfaith Alliance , which favors strict enforcement of the rules on the principle that religion is compromised by involvement in partisan politics , has arranged conference calls for clergy members to discuss the new guidelines with I.R.S. officials .
Ms. Mathis , the agency ’s spokeswoman , declined to discuss its investigative techniques , but said that cases springing from Web sites had raised new issues .
If a cleric appears on his or her church ’s Web page endorsing or attacking a candidate , she said , that is clearly no different from a sermon in the pulpit .
Should we be worried ?
Brown raises savings guarantee to £ 50,000 after day of turmoil
Gordon Brown raises savings guarantee from £ 35,000 to £ 50,000
HBOS shares drop 20 % amid takeover repricing talk
FTSE loses £ 24bn before rallying with a positive close
Brown holds ' reassuring ' media interviews after summit with Bank of England governor
Bush tells Congress it ' must act ' to avert disaster
Gordon Brown will guarantee savings up to £ 50,000 when parliament reconvenes next week
Gordon Brown has confirmed that the government plans to raise the guarantee for bank savings to £ 50,000 from £ 35,000 in a new banking law .
Brown confirmed the increase would be included in banking reforms to be put to parliament soon .
Speaking to reporters he said : ' We 're raising it to £ 50,000 . '
Protection of bank deposits has become a key public concern after the government was forced to nationalise two mortgage lenders this year , Northern Rock and Bradford & Bingley .
In a consultation document released in July , the Treasury proposed increasing the compensation limit to £ 50,000 , on a per person per bank basis .
Brown repeated his pledge to do ' whatever is necessary ' to get Britain through the global financial turmoil after Chancellor Alistair Darling held emergency talks with opposition parties .
' It 's in the banking bill and it will go through very quickly and I hope it will go through with all - party support , ' he said .
And he again insisted that the UK was in a ' far stronger position financially than in previous decades ' and well placed to get through the present difficulties .
His ' vote of confidence ' in the economy came as The FTSE - 100 fell by £ 24 billion during early trading , before rallying throughout the day with news that the U.S. President is still pushing for an American bail - out .
By the close of trading , it had risen 1.7 per cent - or 83.7 points - finishing at 4902.4 .
Gordon Brown offered reassurance on the economy and is will guarantee savings up to £ 50,000
The banking bill is expected to be introduced when parliament resumes next week , and will strengthen supervision and give regulators powers to step in when a bank is failing to seize its assets and save customers ' deposits .
Banks had been worried that they might have to pay billions of pounds into the deposit protection scheme when balance sheets are under strain because of the credit crunch , but the government has assured banks they will not have to pay money upfront .
It was a wildly different picture from the hefty falls predicted today , and clawed back some of yesterday 's 5 per cent slump .
But , in the face of demands from Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg for a ' cast iron guarantee ' that no depositors would lose out , the Prime Minister said he believed Government plans to extend the present protection level to £ 50,000 would be sufficient .
In one of a round of media interviews , Mr Brown said : ' We will do whatever is necessary , however it is necessary , to ensure the stability of the system , which is vital to the security of family budgets and the security of pensioners with savings . '
Brown told reporters the irresponsibility in the financial markets ' has to be dealt with ' but denied failing to prevent it happen when he was Chancellor .
' These are essentially problems that were created by the explosion of financial markets in the States - they affect every other country .
' Where there is irresponsibility - and to be honest , the risk - taking that is irresponsible has been concealed - we have to take action .
' The regulators did not know what was actually happening . '
Asked whether he would follow the Irish Government in giving a full guarantee for savers , he said : ' Let 's remember that the Irish are dealing with taxpayers ' money here .
We have got to get what is right and also what is reasonable .
' Of course we look at every intervention that is necessary to take but I think people can see from our actions so far that depositors have been protected - no UK depositor has actually lost money . '
Ireland guaranteed all bank deposits on Tuesday in a bid to improve the industry 's access to international funds frozen by the global credit crunch .
The pledge , which covers up to 400 billion euros of liabilities - more than twice the country 's annual gross domestic product - and includes retail , commercial and interbank deposits , takes effect immediately and expires in September 2010 .

Crisis talks : Bank of England governor Mervyn King leaving Downing Street today after an emergency breakfast meeting with Gordon Brown
Earlier today Bank of England Governor Mervyn King arrived for a breakfast discussion with the PM and Chancellor Alistair Darling ahead of the regular Cabinet meeting at Downing Street .
The meeting came as the Stock Exchange was rocked by the fallout of the rejection in the U.S. of George Bush 's £ 400 billion ( $ 700 billion ) banks bail - out .
However U.S. stocks clawed back from Wall Street 's devastating slide as investors bet Washington would resuscitate a plan to stabilize the U.S. financial sector despite Monday 's defeat .
The benchmark S&P 500 rose more than 4 percent to recover nearly half of the prior day 's losses after U.S. President George W. Bush pledged to continue talks on a $ 700 billion rescue plan .
On the failed bail - out , Mr Brown told Sky News : ' What has happened is clearly disappointing and clearly a matter of regret because it has created so much uncertainty , not just through America but around the world .
' I'm confident that reason will prevail , reason must prevail and I think reason will prevail .
' When people have seen in Congress and in Senate the effect of what happened yesterday , I believe that reason in time , perhaps on Thursday , will prevail . '
He added : ' I believe the Americans have come to realise that they have a responsibility to the rest of the world as well as themselves and in Britain we will do whatever is necessary , however it is necessary . '
On UK efforts to shore up the banking sector , the Prime Minister said : ' We are dealing with the problems one by one that have emerged as a result of the fall - out from America . '
He added : ' This is the time to roll up our sleeves and sort out the system . '
Mr Brown and Mr Darling spent an hour briefing the Cabinet on the crisis and possible measures to stabilise the markets .
Conservative leader David Cameron requested talks with the Prime Minister last night and they spoke at around midnight , with Mr Cameron promising his support for any emergency measures .
Mr Brown also called Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg , who promised to co-operate with the Government .
Mr Clegg today called for a ' cast - iron guarantee ' that savers would be protected .
He said : ' British people need total reassurance that their savings are safe . '
A Downing Street spokesman said : ' We obviously welcome constructive support . '
David Cameron offered the Tory 's support for a cross-party deal to tackle the financial crash
President Bush this afternoon repeated that the entire American economy depended on a bail - out being agreed and told politicians they had to do their duty to save the country from disaster .
' For the financial security of every American , Congress must act , ' he said at the White House as both parties were in fresh talks in a bid to reach a new agreement .
Moments later , the Dow Jones opened for business with little sign of yesterday 's chaos .
Within less than an hour , it was up more than 250 points .
In the UK , despite gains on the FTSE - 100 overall , banks shares were still being pounded .
Shares in Halifax Bank of Scotland tumbled almost 15 per cent at one point amid rumours Lloyds TSB was repricing the terms of its takeover deal .
Lloyds , whose value was up five per cent , has offered 0.833 of its own shares - currently equivalent to 187p - for every HBOS share in a deal valuing the lender at £ 9.8 billion but HBOS was trading 33 per cent lower at around 125 p today .
An HBOS spokesman shrugged off the concerns , insisting it was ' full team ahead ' .
' Share price volatility in bank stocks is part of the menu at the moment .
These are not normal times , ' he said .
U.S. President George W. Bush speaks about the economic rescue plan at the White House on Tuesday
Royal Bank of Scotland shares also dropped eight per cent before climbing back to be four per cent down amid fears about its exposure to the bad debt crisis .
The timing of the Downing Street summit this morning , just before the weekly Cabinet meeting , raised the prospect a stability package could be announced .
Downing Street insisted it was ' routine ' .
A source said : ' It is natural that the Prime Minister , the Chancellor and the Bank governor should meet in such circumstances . '
Meanwhile , David Cameron insisted the bitter political infighting in the U.S. over its economic rescue must not be repeated in Britain .
In a surprise speech on the financial crisis to the Tory conference in Birmingham , he promised to work with Government on any necessary action to increase stability .
' Today it is the time for us to send a clear message to our political opponents and to our country that we will not allow the political wrangling that took place in America to happen here in our own country , ' he said .
' In Britain , we are all in this together so in Britain let us stick together and together we will find a way through . '
Chief Whip Geoff Hoon , in an interview with tomorrow 's New Statesman , calls the crisis worse than Black Wednesday in 1992 .
He says it is ' actually far more significant than John Major 's government being forced out of the ERM ' .
Chaos : Wall Street traders found themselves looking at ruin as the Dow Jones Index went from into freefall in the worst day of trading in history
The Treasury were also locked in discussions about the crisis today with the Financial Services Authority as shares fell across the globe in the wake of the vote in America .
And Chancellor Alistair Darling met with his Tory and Liberal Democrat counterparts later to ensure they were working together .
John McFall , chairman of the Commons Treasury Select Committee , said U.S. politicians had ' turned off the life support system for the economy ' .
The interbank lending rate - known as the LIBOR and normally close to the base rate , which is currently five per cent - soared as financial institutions hoarded cash .
In sterling markets it rocketed overnight by 1.5 per cent to 6.78 , while the dollar lending rate trebled in just one day to hit 6.88 per cent .
Across the globe , shares tumbled : Germany 's DAX was down more than 60 points or 1.15 per cent while the Cac - 40 in France dropped 26 points or 0.68 per cent .
In Asia , Japan 's Nikkei closed down 4.1 per cent and the Hang Seng in Hong Kong plunged as much as six per cent before recovering to close up 0.76 per cent .
Australian shares also tumbled 5.3 per cent before closing 2.4 per cent down as stocks in New Zealand , India , Singapore , the Philippines and South Korea dipped .
Belgium , France and Luxembourg were forced to inject almost 6.4 billion euros into the bank Dexia , making it the second Belgian bank this week to be bailed out .
Trading on Russia 's two main stock markets was suspended and in Ireland , the government announced it would guarantee all bank deposits for the next two years in a bid to instil some confidence .
The FTSE in London had risen back to be around 80 points in afternoon trading amid hopes of a fresh vote on the U.S. bail - out in Congress later this week .
Richard Hunter , head of equities at Hargreaves Lansdown stockbrokers , said : ' This deal is not dead in the water and there are hopes that when Congress reconvenes it could still go through . '
There was also the promise of a rebound on Wall Street when the market opens this afternoon after Dow futures indicated shares could recover .
President Bush is due to address members of Congress again today in a fresh appeal to get his Bill passed .
Failed :
The bail - out bid was rejected by the House of Representatives , sparking panic on Wall Street where share prices fell dramatically
Republicans from his own party sparked the meltdown yesterday by killing it off in the House of Representatives .
Opposition centred on the concern that hard - working taxpayers would be left carrying the bill for the failures at U.S. banks , rather than the finance giants themselves .
Wall Street 's Dow Jones index plummeted as U.S. analysts reacted with horror when it was rejected by 226 to 207 votes .
The fall of 777 points was the biggest in one day ever on the New York stock exchange - though not as great in percentage terms as the fall in share prices in the Great Crash of 1929 or Black Monday in October 1987 .
Banking experts warned of a ' failure of the financial system ' unless senior officials in the U.S. administration can hammer out a compromise deal in the next few days .
Stephen Berte , of Standard Life in Boston , said : ' I can't believe they were n't able to come together and come up with a solution .
Complete disaster was predicted if it did n't pass ... and it did n't pass . '
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson , who masterminded the original rescue strategy , said : ' We need to put something back together that works . '
He promised to 'use all the tools available to protect our financial system , ' but warned he warned that ' our toolkit is substantial but insufficient ' .

MOSCOW ( Reuters ) - A senior Russian Foreign Ministry official on Tuesday shrugged off anti-Russian remarks by U.S. presidential candidate John McCain and said Moscow could handle any unwanted turn in relations with Washington .
Republican McCain , who will fight Democratic candidate Barack Obama in the November election , has angered Russia by suggesting it should be excluded from the Group of Eight leading nations for falling short of its high democracy standards .
“ Let him first become the U.S. president , and then we will listen attentively to him , ” the official , who spoke on condition of anonymity , told a news briefing .
In the past few years Moscow and Washington clashed over a growing number of key international issues ranging from Iran ’s nuclear program to U.S. plans to deploy elements of its missile defense system in Eastern Europe .
But good personal relations between the presidents of the two countries have helped to keep up the dialogue , viewed in both capitals as crucial for international stability .
Russia ’s Dmitry Medvedev , who took office in May , and U.S. George W. Bush , who will hand over powers to a successor in January , agreed during their last meeting in Japan earlier this month that continuity should be ensured in bilateral ties .
Russian officials say McCain ’s suggestions that Washington should adopt a tougher stance against Russia , criticized by Obama , are part of his campaigning style and will inevitably be adjusted to match the reality should he win the polls .
But the Russian Foreign ministry official said Moscow was ready for any turn of events .
“ We are ready for any development of relations , ” he said .
“ In the long run , we can afford not having any relations with some of our partners , if they wish so ... ”
“ The only thing we want is the U.S. electorate to bear responsibility for its choice , ” he added .
Russia ’s previous president , Vladimir Putin , whose assertive foreign policy irked the West throughout his eight years in power , has blamed Washington for seeking to dominate the world .
Medvedev has softened the anti-Western rhetoric but made clear Moscow will not step back in principal disagreements with the West , including the United States .
The Foreign ministry official said Moscow was patient .
“ Everything is fine until we are told how to behave , who to be friends with , who to fight against , who must be hated , who you must bed down with and who must be shown the door , ” he said .
But he blamed the U.S. partners for trying to impose their agenda in the bilateral dialogue and ignore Russia ’s interests .
Moscow one day could lose interest in such dialogue , he said .
“ Personally , it seems to me we could reach a moment when we can afford to give up discussing the issues that the Americans are interested in , ” the official said .
The five - year conflict in Darfur has left 300,000 people dead
Sudanese government troops have launched attacks on two towns in Darfur , three rebel groups in the region have said .
The rebels said the troops , backed by militias , helicopters and planes , had attacked Disa and Birmaza in North Darfur state early on Saturday .
The joint United Nations - African Union peacekeeping force in Darfur said it was investigating the reports .
There has been no comment on the rebel claims from the Sudanese military .
' String of attacks '
" There are many dead , both civilians and some of our soldiers too , " a commander of a faction of the rebel Sudan Liberation Army , Ibrahim al - Helwu , was quoted as saying by the AFP news agency .
" The fighting is still going on , they are inside the town and are looting , " he said from Disa .
Commanders of two other rebel groups also said their forces in the area , north of the town of Kutum , were also involved in the fighting .
Rebel groups have accused government forces of launching a string of attacks on insurgent - held areas in North Darfur in recent months .
One rebel commander , Sherif Harir , from the Sudan Liberation Movement - Unity faction , said Khartoum was trying to wrest control of key transport routes and oil reserves in the area , Reuters news agency reported .
The five - year conflict in Darfur has led to the deaths of more than 300,000 people and the displacement of two million others , according to UN estimates .
The violence began in 2003 when rebel groups complaining of discrimination against black Africans began attacking government targets .

OF NEW YORK NEWS CONFERENCE Friday , August 29 , 2008IS SHE THE ONE ?
OBAMA AUTHOR ANDY MARTIN REACTS TO THE CHICAGO TRIBUNE REPORT ALASKA'S GOVERNOR HAS BEEN CHOSEN AS MCCAIN'S RUNNING MATE
I can now safely report and predict that John McCain is going to be the next President of the United States .
The Chicago Tribune is reporting that Senator McCain has chosen a woman as his running mate .
Earlier this week in Denver at the DNC , I noted that John McCain could make a game - changing move in his campaign against Barack Obama : McCain could choose a woman for the White House .
There are some indications McCain has now done just that .
Later today ( August 29th ) we will comment on the impact of Barack Obama 's convention speech .
In the meantime , why is the choice of a woman so critical ?
I teased Democrats in Denver by saying Obama should have chosen Governor Sebelius of Kansas as his running mate .
Why ?
My unscientific opinion : " She dresses like a Republican woman . "
I was only party being facetious .
But if you saw Susan Eisenhower support Barack Obama Thursday night you know what I mean .
The first African - American president is going to be a Republican , and the first woman president or vice - president is going to be a woman .
Why is that ?
How counterintuitive .
The nature of the Republican Party makes it open to social change , but only social change that is channeled within broadly acceptable norms of public policy .
McCain is thinking strategically .
He sees that there is disaffection among Democratic woman .
Many Clinton supporters are up for grabs .
The presidential race is close .
Which voters are open to switching their allegiance ?
Democratic women who supported Hillary Clinton .
That is the largest " uncommitted " block of voters available to either McCain or Obama .
( Blue collar Democrats are a close second in the " uncommitted " column , but they will find a conservative woman as vice president very acceptable . )
McCain has chosen to seize the initiative and go after the Clinton vote .
McCain 's decision shows that he is a brilliant tactician and strategist .
Obama lacked the confidence to choose a woman , because he was afraid of offending the Clintons .
McCain suffers from no such inhibitions .
His decision is going to throw Barack Obama back on his bottom and evaporate the " bounce " out of Denver .
By this afternoon ( Friday ) , McCain will have seized the news cycle and devastated Obama 's post - Denver appeal .
People do watch TV and listen to the radio on Labor Day weekend ; McCain will have a monopoly on that coverage going into his convention .
Media types do not really understand McCain ; in my opinion I do .
I once had a roommate who was a navy fighter pilot .
I know Navy fighter pilots .
They are bold , decisive and have guts to spare .
I have not been stinting in either my praise or criticism of McCain in the past , and no doubt I will have critical comments in the future .
But in his choice of a running mate , I can only say , McCain you were my roommate .
Bold , decisive , gutsy and clear thinking .
We 've just landed on a carrier ; in the meantime , Barack Obama 's campaign has come to a complete and abject stop .
You are going to see the polls shift in McCain 's favor , radically and immediately .
By mid-September the liberal news media will be in a mega - funk .
Women voters in both parties will be ecstatic .
Welcome aboard , Governor .
Now this indeed will be a historic election .
The first woman as vice president .
My money is on the Republicans .
Yours should be too .
John McCain just became the next President of the United States .

( NEW YORK ) ( August 29 , 2008 )
The leader of the national anti-Obama movement , opinion columnist Andy Martin , will hold a New York sidewalk news conference Friday , August 29th to comment on the expected choice of Alaska 's governor as John McCain 's running mate .

Obama lacked the confidence to choose a woman , because he was afraid of offending the Clintons .
McCain suffers from no such inhibitions .
His decision is going to throw Barack Obama back on his bottom and evaporate the " bounce " out of Denver .
By this afternoon ( Friday ) , McCain will have seized the news cycle and devastated Obama 's post - Denver appeal .
People do watch TV and listen to the radio on Labor Day weekend ; McCain will have a monopoly on that coverage going into his convention .
Media types do not really understand McCain ; in my opinion I do .
I once had a roommate who was a navy fighter pilot .
I know Navy fighter pilots .
They are bold , decisive and have guts to spare .
I have not been stinting in either my praise or criticism of McCain in the past , and no doubt I will have critical comments in the future .
But in his choice of a running mate , I can only say , McCain you were my roommate .
Bold , decisive , gutsy and clear thinking .
We 've just landed on a carrier ; in the meantime , Barack Obama 's campaign has come to a complete and abject stop .
You are going to see the polls shift in McCain 's favor , radically and immediately .
By mid-September the liberal news media will be in a mega - funk .
Women voters in both parties will be ecstatic .
Welcome aboard , Governor .
Now this indeed will be a historic election .
The first woman as vice president .
My money is on the Republicans .
Yours should be too .
John McCain just became the next President of the United States .

John McCain continues his expertise in politics with the choice of Sarah Palin as his running mate .
He also continues his quite Bill Clinton - like “ wherever the wind blows ” stances on policy .
I do n’t understand how John McCain can argue for his VP selection with a straight face when he says that she “ can best help me shake up Washington and make it start working again for people who are counting on us . ”
McCain has been working in Washington for almost 30 years .
He is partly responsible for the broken Washington he himself , and now Palin , aims to fix .
The hypocrisy is rampant .
Sarah Palin is nothing more than a pretty political puppet for McCain ’s politics as usual .
McCain and his expert campaigners have selected someone who the Ron Paul faithful singled out as a potential running mate for Dr. Paul should he magically win the GOP nomination .
She has a great conservative record of cutting spending and demanding ethics in government although she is no stranger to alleged ethics violations herself .
She is greatly similar to McCain in that light .
McCain was part of the Keating 5 Savings and Loan scandal in the 1980’s .
He seems to have an expertise in getting people to ignore such things by championing reform of the very things he ’s accused of abusing .
Palin has a much shorter history of such things , but she has “ welcomed the investigation ” of herself after being accused of similar nepotism .
On the policy front there are decidedly non-McCain - like Palin positions .
She is a very strong proponent of drilling in Alaska , while McCain is still clinging on the protection of ANWR .
She has spoken out against “ cap and trade ” while McCain has made it a key element of his platform .
When the Alaskan legislature voted to not fund the implementation of REAL ID Act , Governor Palin acquiesced by not vetoing nor signing the bill .
The effect being that Alaska has now rejected the federally mandated REAL ID .
The ACLU even praised Palin for her inaction .
McCain is a vocal supporter of REAL ID and an assortment of federal legislation that pretends there is no 10th amendment to the Constitution .
There is very little information about where Sarah Palin stands on foreign policy .
Though whatever it was , her previous stance on foreign policy matters little now .
This is perfect for McCain ’s manipulation of her puppet strings .
She will no doubt now be a vocal supporter of “ the surge ” and continued occupation of “ Iraq ” and other countries who “ harbor ” terrorism .
With her acceptance as McCain ’s VP she has now joined the neo-conservatives in supporting a foreign policy of preemptive war , occupation , and interventionism .
However , there is some potential good with her selection .
It arguably could demonstrate that McCain has seen the kind of support Ron Paul received and is trying to move more to the “ Old Right ” ( or more towards libertarianism ever so slightly ) .
Perhaps he is trying to mitigate Bob Barr ’s spoiler potential .
These arguments are quite a bit of a reach .
Palin is no libertarian , but she certainly has a history of supporting more libertarian notions than McCain .
I suspect her future statements will reveal her as straying further from the libertarian mindset .
In the end McCain ’s selection is an extremely good politically motivated strategic move .
I can just hear the McCain camp now discussing the positives of Sarah Palin : “ She ’s a woman …
She ’s staunchly pro-life …
She ’s a maverick like our candidate …
She ’s about as much of a DC outsider as there is …
She ’s a well loved social conservative … ” , and so on .
William Kristol , the premier neo-conservative New York Times columnist and editor of The Weekly Standard strongly pushed for Sarah Palin to be McCain ’s VP choice back in June .
Perhaps the actual “ Neocon Of Oz ” is Kristol himself .
Maybe he ’s the real puppeteer here , pulling McCain ’s and now Palin ’s strings towards his idea of the American Neo-conservative empire .
Gods help us .

9/12/08 will be remembered as the day we finally caught one of the bad guys — a 4th grader with a broken pencil sharpener .
A 10 - year - old Hilton Head Island boy has been suspended from school for having something most students carry in their supply boxes : a pencil sharpener .
The problem was his sharpener had broken , but he decided to use it anyway .
…
The boy — a fourth - grader described as a well - behaved and good student — cried during the meeting with his mom , the deputy and the school 's assistant principal .
He had no criminal intent in having the blade at school , the sheriff 's report stated , but was suspended for at least two days and could face further disciplinary action .
THE setting was perfect for a memorial to a lost kayaker , the eulogies were moving , but nothing shook the hundreds of mourners gathering at Macquarie Lighthouse at South Head more than the last words of Andrew McAuley himself .
A recording of observations McAuley made on his last journey - an attempt to become the first person to kayak from Australia to New Zealand - had been found in his overturned vessel .
McAuley , who left Fortescue Bay on the east coast of Tasmania on January 11 and was close to completing the journey when he disappeared on February 9 , had described the hardships of his journey .
The woman found wandering the Woodbridge Center mall on Nov. 2 , 1994 , appeared to be in her mid-50s , spoke only Spanish and could n't remember her name or where she lived .
She carried an empty purse with no identification .
What mall security guards and police officers knew about her they divined by her appearance :
She wore two rings , including a wed ding band .
Her hair was combed and her clothes were clean .
Fourteen years later , authorities still do n't know much about her .
The mystery woman , alternately referred to as " Jane Doe " and " Elba , " has lived quietly -- and anonymously -- in New Jersey 's psychiatric hospital system .
Sensing time may be running out -- diagnosed with Alzheimer 's disease , she is bedridden at the Garrett Hagedorn Psychiatric Hospital in Hunterdon County -- state Human Services officials are launching the biggest effort yet to find out who she is .
" Every human being is entitled to the minimal dignity of dying at least with their name , " said Lt. Eduardo Ojeda of the Human Services Police Department .
" This lady is a human being .
I am sure she has some family member out there or friends who never knew what happened or what became of her .
She may be a mother , a sister .
She may be someone 's grandmother . "
Beginning this week , the woman 's photos will be circulated to media outlets , particularly the Spanish - speaking press .
Ojeda has contacted the consulates for the Colombian and Venezuelan governments and plans to canvass offices of other Central and South America countries .
Most familiar with her case sus pect she came to this country illegally .
They believe when she showed signs of amnesia or dementia , a relative or friend may have left her at the mall , assuming someone would come to her aid .
Amy Bellisano , senior general manager at Woodbridge Center , recalls when a security guard found her wandering the sprawling two - story mall .
" It appeared someone had dropped her off .
We kept thinking someone would come to find her , " Bellisano said .
" She spent most of the day in our mall office conference room .
She had no idea why she was here ... she looked clean and well cared for . "
Walter Dnistran , the mall 's maintenance supervisor , asked her questions in Spanish , but she seemed confused , Bellisano said .
" Ultimately we had to call the police because we could n't get any information from her .
I remember feeling very sad , " she said .
After two weeks at Raritan Bay Medical Center in Perth Amboy , where doctors said she was in good physical health , she was transferred to the public psychiatric hospital system : Marlboro in Mon mouth County until it closed in 1997 , Ancora in Camden County until 2002 , and now Hagedorn , where she lives among 300 other patients , mostly senior citizens , said hospital CEO Debra A. Smith .
The name plate on her bedroom door says " J. Doe . "
It 's possible her name is Elba because in a rare mo ment 14 years ago , she told a Spanish - speaking aide at Marlboro her name was " Elba Leonor Socarras , " Ojeda said .
Once , she told a worker she was " Alba . "
Law enforcement officers said she 's uttered a name of a person they suspect she may have known : " Altagracia Alvarez . "
She may have lived in Colombia -- or maybe it was Colonia , a sec tion of Woodbridge Township .
" She was not too clear .
She was found in Woodbridge , which is close to Colonia , " said Nathali Ruiz , a social worker at Hagedorn .
The woman stopped talking while at Ancora , hospital workers said .
Aside from taking her meals in the nearby dining room , she spends her time in a private room at Hagedorn in Glen Gardner , its windows offering a view , 1,800 feet above sea level , of the lush hills of Spruce Run State Park .
" She 's in her own world , " said Jean Henderson , a Hagedorn employee who helps look after her .
Occasionally she 'll moan or grimace to communicate discom fort , like when she is among other patients for too long .
She 'll smile " whenever you are giving her care , " said Ana Cartegena , another Human Services technician .
When a group of visitors stopped by Thursday , " Elba , " wearing a flowered nightgown , was lying in a reclining chair , a teddy bear and a crocheted purple blan ket on the night table next to her .
Ojeda gently asked the same questions he does on every visit : " What is your name ?
Where is your husband ? "
She met his gaze briefly and squeezed his finger extra hard .
" Maybe she 's trying to tell me something , " he said .
In six years , Ojeda has never reached her .
He said this is the most concerted effort to find her identity .
" In those first few years , the case got passed around from agency to agency , " he said .
" Perth Amboy police at one time circu lated a poster with her picture on it .
When she was at Ancora , the Camden County sheriff put her on the internet , and they still have her picture there . "
Ojeda recently enlisted a detective to fingerprint " Elba " -- no easy feat because her arms are stiff and her fingertips wrinkled , he said .
They were sent to consulates in Venezuela and Colombia , but there 's been no response .
Tony Evelina , a volunteer researcher with the Doe Network , ( doenetwork.org ) , a site for missing and unidentified people , doubts fingerprints will reveal anything .
" I 've have been working on this woman 's case , and I have a feeling she is illegal , " he said .
" If she had a green card , immigration would have had ( fingerprints ) on file . "
Because nobody knows whether " Elba " is a U.S. citizen , she does not receive Medicaid and can't be transferred to a nursing home , said Susan Hollander Whitman at the state Office of the Public Guardian for Elderly Adults .
" She does n't belong in a psychiatric hospital , " said Whitman .
She said her office represents " quite a few people " in the same predicament .
" If we do n't have proof of where they are from and their citizenship , they are stuck wherever they are , " she said .
Smith said each state psychiatric hospital typically has one or two " Jane Does " or " John Does . "
Unidentified people who die at a state institution are buried in a potter 's field -- with numbers on their headstones instead of their names .
That troubles Ojeda .
" My hope is we will be able to identify her , while she is still around , " he said .
" ' We 're hoping the public will help us . "
People with information about " Elba 's " identity may contact Lt. Eduardo Ojeda at ( 609) 633-3673 or Eduardo.Ojeda@dhs.state.nj.us
Callers may remain anonymous .
It was little wonder that the match was high on drama .
Williams is a card - carrying member of the Screen Actors Guild , and Jankovic , who has battled a host of injuries from head to toe this year , has said she probably would have gone to school and studied theater if she had n’t become a professional tennis player .
“ I got the trophy here , ” Jankovic said , “ and I thought , you know , I should have gotten an Oscar for all this drama throughout the week .
Despite , you know , getting a trophy , I should have gotten , you know , a trophy for the acting , for my drama .
I think I ’ve done a great job . ”
No woman has gone so long between stints at the top as Williams , who came into the tournament ranked No. 3 and will overtake Ana Ivanovic , who lost in the second round .
“ I ca n’t believe I ’m No. 1 , ” she said .
“ It ’s been so long . ”
Williams did not drop a set in the tournament and lost 40 games .
It was a performance reminiscent of 2002 , when she did not drop a set and beat Venus in the first women ’s prime - time final .
As ecstatic as she was after match point , Williams made it clear in her news conference 90 minutes later that nine was not enough .
“ I ’m pushing the doors to double digits , which I obviously want to get to , ” she said , adding , “ I feel like I can do it . ”
Williams ’s place in the pantheon of American luminaries was secure no matter what happened Sunday .
That it had been five years since she held the No. 1 ranking did not preclude the two men behind the recent HBO documentary “ The Black List ” from including her in their portraits of 22 of the most fascinating and influential black Americans .
The 26 - year - old Williams joined , among others , the Nobel Prize - winning author Toni Morrison and the former Secretary of State Colin Powell in pulling back the curtain to reveal the challenges and rewards of black life in the United States .
Sports Business : The Death Of The Goon
Page 1 of 4
Did you happen to catch the little tete - à- tete between Toronto ’s Wade Belak and Ottawa ’s Brian McGrattan in the rematch of the Battle of Ontario ?
In case you missed it , it was one of those meaningless bouts that occurred early in the second period during the second of back - to - back games to kick off the season between bitter rivals .
It took place away from the play and apparently for no reason other than that is what both men are paid to do — fight .
McGrattan would suggest he was simply trying to give his home team a lift after it fell behind 2 - 0 by doing what he does best ; except , in the end , the fight accomplished absolutely nothing .
Choreographed fights
The pair traded blow - for - blow punches , eventually got tired , gave the linesmen the signal to separate them , and rather politely headed to their home away from home : the penalty box .
It was one of those tilts without a clear winner that prompts the uneducated — particularly those who have never exchanged knuckles while trying to balance themselves on skates — to suggest NHL fights are as phoney as the choreographed theatrics in professional wrestling .
Of course that is pure bunk , but when Belak gives McGrattan a little wink after they have settled themselves in the penalty box , well , you can see why some observers suggest that fights are staged .
And it was one of those fights you are seeing fewer and fewer of with each passing year .
Fighting in the NHL is on the decline ; it was down 41 % in the 2005 - 06 season from 2003 - 04 , the year before the lockout .
In fact , there were only 0.75 fighting majors called per game in 2005 - 06 compared to 1.27 in 2003 - 04 .
A game in flux
The NHL still has a handful of goons , but they are rapidly becoming extinct .
In fact , McGrattan , who led the NHL with 19 fights as a rookie , spent the off - season working out with talented teammate Jason Spezza in an attempt to raise his skill level .
McGrattan says he is very aware of the direction that the NHL game is heading and does not want to be left behind in the dust .
“ I ’ll be the first to admit fighters are a dying breed , and to play in the NHL today , you have to be able to play a regular shift , ” says the 6 - foot - 5 - inch , 238 - pound McGrattan , who led the AHL in penalty minutes in 2004 with 551 .
“ You have to be able to bring more to the table than just fighting .
The guys who play just two shifts a night and do nothing more than fight will fade away . ”

New Poll Shows Obama Lead in Crucial States Obama 's ahead in Ohio and Pennsylvania , while McCain leads in Florida .
Sept. 11 , 2008  --
If there are three states that are the most crucial in the November presidential election , they will likely be Ohio , Florida and Pennsylvania .
Since 1960 , no candidate has ever won the presidency without winning two of these three battleground states .
Republican Sen. John McCain is leading handily in Florida and Democratic Sen. Barack Obama has narrow leads in Ohio and Pennsylvania , according to polls released today by Quinnipiac University .
While McCain has surged in national polls , the ones that really count are those in swing states that will decide which candidate wins the votes in the Electoral College .
As Democrat Al Gore demonstrated , it is possible to win the popular vote and lose the election .
The Quinnipiac poll gives Obama a 5 percent edge , 49 - 44 , in Ohio .
Obama has an even narrower 48 - 45 lead in Pennsylvania , while McCain has comfortable 50 - 42 margin in Florida .
" It 's a close race .
It 's likely to go down to the wire , " ABC News ' senior Washington correspondent , George Stephanopoulos , told " Good Morning America " today .
" If you 're going to pay attention to one state this year , it 's got to be Ohio , " Stephanopoulos said .
" No Republican has won the presidency without winning Ohio . "
Watch Charles Gibson 's exclusive interviews with Gov. Sarah Palin tonight on " Nightline . "
Tune in Friday for more on " Good Morning America " at 7 a.m. ET .
See more on " World News " and " 20/20 , " which will broadcast a one - hour special edition at 10 p.m. ET/9 p.m. CT .
It was a state that President George W. Bush won by a mere 100,000 votes four years ago , and both Obama and McCain are concentrating on Ohio this year .
" The Obama campaign has ramped up their turnout operation , particularly in the big cities and college campuses , but the McCain campaign hopes that the pick of Alaska Governor Sarah Palin will energize their voters , particularly in southern Ohio , " Stephanopoulos said .
Sen. Hillary Clinton , who won the Democratc primary in Ohio , will campaign for Obama in the state this weekend .
A new Time / CNN poll surveyed several other key states and found both candidates were holding their own in states their parties won in previous elections .
Obama was leading in New Hampshire ( 51 - 45 ) and in Michigan ( 49 - 45 ) , both states won by Democrat John Kerry four years ago .
McCain is ahead in Virginia ( 50 - 46 ) and in Missouri ( 50 - 45 ) , states Bush won in 2004 .
Video Surfaces of McCain Release From POW Camp
The fight for voters was suspended by the two campaigns today to mark the seventh anniversary of the 9/11 terror attacks .
Instead of attacking each other , McCain and Obama joined forces for a solemn wreath laying ceremony at Ground Zero , the sight of the suicide airplane attacks on the Twin Towers .
" We will put aside politics and come together to renew that unity , to honor the memory of each and every American who died , and to grieve with the families and friends who lost loved ones , " said a joint statement released by the two campaigns .
On Friday , the two sides are expected to resume their salvos on everything from economic policy to lipstick smears .
In what may be an emotional boost for McCain , a Swedish reporter found in his files a film clip of McCain 's release from a Vietnamese prison .
The brief video shows McCain stepping off a bus with other prisoners with a pronounced limp , but not using crutches .
It then shows McCain standing in a lineup when his name is called .
He walks up to salute and shake hands with U.S. military officers .
But McCain and Obama will likely be overshadowed yet again by Palin , the Republican vice presidential candidate who has stolen the limelight ever since she was nominated earlier this month .
The spotlight will be on her today and Friday as she sits down for her first interview since the nomination .
That interview will be conducted by ABC News ' anchor , Charlie Gibson .
" She 's been cramming for this ...
There 's an army of former Bush aides out there working with her in every free moment between her stump speeches , " Stephanopoulos told " GMA . "
Among Palin 's chief tutors are senior McCain adviser Nicolle Wallace and Tucker Eskew , a former Bush aide and longtime GOP strategist .
It could be a high stakes moment for Palin , who so far has n't strayed from the speech she gave at the Republican National Convention .
" She 's got to show that she can handle the questions , show that she 's ready for this job of vice president , and show familiarity with the issues , " Stephanopoulos said .
Obama on Letterman
Democrats will be poring over her answers looking for opportunities to pounce and puncture her instant popularity , which has buoyed the McCain candidacy .
Palin will also attend a deployment ceremony for her son's infantry unit , the 1st Stryker Brigade Combat Team , 25th Infantry Division , at Fort Wainwright in Alaska .
Obama went on the " the David Letterman Show " Wednesday night to try to laugh off the GOP demands that he apologize for using the phrase " lipstick on a pig . "
Obama made the comment referring to McCain 's claim that he would bring change to Washington , but Republicans insisted it was an insult to Palin , who had earlier compared herself to a pitbull with lipstick .
Obama shrugged off the accusation , telling Letterman it was the political " silly season . "
But " silly season " diversions are not good for Obama , who was put on the defensive by the McCain camp 's attack over his phrasing .
" The silly season is not good for Barack Obama , " Stephanopoulos said .
" Every day that is about the campaign or personalities is a losing day for Obama . "
There is a downside in the daily attacks for McCain as well , Stephanopoulos said .
" The Obama campaign hopes that they may start to chip away at John McCain 's maverick record and his reputation for integrity , " he said .
First amendment trashed as journalists body slammed , beaten and handcuffed simply for covering protests
Paul Joseph Watson
Prison Planet
Tuesday , September 2 , 2008
Plaudits for the relative restraint of Denver police during last week ’s Democratic National Convention are not set to be repeated at the RNC , as cops signaled their intent by arresting an AP photographer as well as Democracy Now host Amy Goodman simply for documenting protests in downtown St. Paul .
Associated Press photographer Matt Rourke was arrested on a gross misdemeanor riot charge simply for taking pictures of a protest yesterday .
“ Covering news is a constitutionally protected activity , and covering a riot is part of that coverage , ” AP assistant chief of bureau in Washington David Ake said .
“ Photographers should not be detained for covering breaking news . ”
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
Democracy Now host Amy Goodman was arrested after she complained about the assault and arrest of her colleagues , Sharif Abdel Kouddous and Nicole Salazar .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
According to Democracy Now , “ All three were violently manhandled by law enforcement officers .
Abdel Kouddous was slammed against a wall and the ground , leaving his arms scraped and bloodied .
He sustained other injuries to his chest and back .
Salazar ’s violent arrest by baton - wielding officers , during which she was slammed to the ground while yelling , “ I ’m Press ! Press ! , ” resulted in her nose bleeding , as well as causing facial pain .
Goodman ’s arm was violently yanked by police as she was arrested . ”
“ During the demonstration in which the Democracy Now ! team was arrested , law enforcement officers used pepper spray , rubber bullets , concussion grenades and excessive force against protesters and journalists .
Several dozen demonstrators were also arrested during this action , including a photographer for the Associated Press . ”
All three were eventually released but face felony charges .
Democracy
Now has vowed to fight the false charges which they characterized as an intimidation of independent journalists .
Another AP photographer , Evan Vucci , was body slammed , kicked in the ribs and then handcuffed by police , only avoiding arrest by showing his press credentials .
“ The police had pushed the protesters into a parking lot where they had police coming from all sides to encircle one area , ” Vucci said .
“ Once they got all the protesters into this one parking lot they kind of rushed and arrested all the protesters in there , ” said Vucci .
With 50,000 demonstrators expected to protest the RNC , more incidents of this kind can be expected .
On Friday , the Ramsey County Sheriff ’s office , directed by federal authorities and armed with semi-automatic weapons , raided the headquarters of a protest group and detained and photographed 50 people .
Six were arrested on charges of organizing a riot .
None of the six have been convicted of a felony or crime of violence and all hold respectable positions within the community .
The raids were carried out after moles were planted in the group by the Minneapolis Joint Terrorist Task Force .
The raids were specifically “ aided by informants planted in protest groups , ” notes Salon writer Glenn Greenwald .
“ Back in May , Marcy Wheeler presciently noted that the Minneapolis Joint Terrorist Task Force — an inter-agency group of federal , state and local law enforcement led by the FBI — was actively recruiting Minneapolis residents to serve as plants , to infiltrate “ vegan groups ” and other left - wing activist groups and report back to the Task Force about what they were doing .
There seems to be little doubt that it was this domestic spying by the Federal Government that led to the excessive and truly despicable home assaults by the police yesterday , ” writes Greenwald .
Amy Goodman arrested for asking questions about the assault and arrest of her colleagues .
Police fire tear gas at protesters as they run away .

Comment on this article
Over the millennia , many mathematicians have hoped that mathematics would one day produce a Theory of Everything ( TOE ) ; a finite set of axioms and rules from which every mathematical truth could be derived .
But in 1931 this hope received a serious blow : Kurt Gödel published his famous Incompleteness Theorem , which states that in every mathematical theory , no matter how extensive , there will always be statements which can't be proven to be true or false .
Gregory Chaitin has been fascinated by this theorem ever since he was a child , and now , in time for the centenary of Gödel 's birth in 2006 , he has published his own book , called Meta Math ! on the subject ( you can read a review in this issue of Plus ) .
It describes his journey , which , from the work of Gödel via that of Leibniz and Turing , led him to the number Omega , which is so complex that no mathematical theory can ever describe it .
In this article he explains what Omega is all about , why maths can have no Theory of Everything , and what this means for mathematicians .
Kurt Gödel
Splattered ink
My story begins with Leibniz in 1686 , the year before Newton published his Principia .
Due to a snow storm , Leibniz is forced to take a break in his attempts to improve the water pumps for some important German silver mines , and writes down an outline of some of his ideas , now known to us as the Discours de métaphysique .
Leibniz then sends a summary of the major points through a mutual friend to the famous fugitive French philosophe Arnauld , who is so horrified at what he reads that Leibniz never sends him , nor anyone else , the entire manuscript .
It languishes among Leibniz 's voluminous personal papers and is only discovered and published many years after Leibniz 's death .
In sections V and VI of the Discours de métaphysique , Leibniz discusses the crucial question of how we can distinguish a world which can be explained by science from one that cannot .
How do we tell whether something we observe in the world around us is subject to some scientific law or just patternless and random ?
Imagine , Leibniz says , that someone has splattered a piece of paper with ink spots , determining in this manner a finite set of points on the page .
Leibniz observes that , even though the points were splattered randomly , there will always be a mathematical curve that passes through this finite set of points .
Indeed , many good ways to do this are now known .
For example , what is called " Lagrangian interpolation " will do .
So the existence of a mathematical curve passing through a set of points cannot enable us to distinguish between points that are chosen at random and those that obey some kind of a scientific law .
How , then , can we tell the difference ?
Well , says Leibniz , if the curve that contains the points must be extremely complex ( " fort composée " ) , then it 's not much use in explaining the pattern of the ink splashes .
It does n't really help to simplify matters and therefore is n't valid as a scientific law — the points are random ( " irrégulier " ) .
The important insight here is that something is random if any description of it is extremely complex — randomness is complexity .
Leibniz had a million other interests and earned a living as a consultant to princes , and as far as I know after having this idea he never returned to this subject .
Indeed , he was always tossing out good ideas , but rarely , with the notable exception of the infinitesimal calculus , had the time to develop them in depth .
The next person to take up this subject , as far as I know , is Hermann Weyl in his 1932 book The Open World , consisting of three lectures on metaphysics that Weyl gave at Yale University .
In fact , I discovered Leibniz 's work on complexity and randomness by reading this little book by Weyl .
And Weyl points out that Leibniz 's way of distinguishing between points that are random and those that follow a law by invoking the complexity of a mathematical formula is unfortunately not too well defined : it depends on what functions you are allowed to use in writing that formula .
What is complex to one person at one particular time may not appear to be complex to another person a few years later — defined in this way , complexity is in the eye of the beholder .
What is complexity ?
Well , the field that I invented in 1965 , and which I call algorithmic information theory , provides a possible solution for the problem of how to measure complexity .
The main idea is that any scientific law , which explains or describes mathematical objects or sets of data , can be turned into a computer program that can compute the original object or data set .
Gottfried von Leibniz
Say , for example , that you have n't splattered the ink on the page randomly , but that you 've carefully placed the spots on a straight line which runs through the page , each spot exactly one centimetre away from the previous one .
The theory describing your set of points would consist of four pieces of information : the equation for the straight line , the total number of spots , the precise location of the first spot , and the fact that the spots are one centimetre apart .
You can now easily write a computer program , based on this information , which computes the precise location of each spot .
In algorithmic information theory , we do n't just say that such a program is based on this underlying theory , we say it is the theory .
This gives a way of measuring the complexity of the underlying object ( in this case our ink stains ) : it is simply the size of the smallest computer program that can compute the object .
The size of a computer program is the number of " bits " it contains : as you will know , computers store their information in strings of 0s and 1s , and each 0 or 1 is called a " bit " .
The more complicated the program , the longer it is and the more bits it contains .
If something we observe is subject to a scientific law , then this law can be encoded as a program .
What we desire from a scientific law is that it be simple — the simpler it is , the better our understanding , and the more useful it is .
And its simplicity — or lack of it — is reflected in the length of the program .
In our example , the complexity of the ink stains is precisely the length in bits of the smallest computer program which comprises our four pieces of information and can compute the location of the spots .
In fact , the ink spots in this case are not very complex at all .
We have added two ideas to Leibniz 's 1686 proposal .
First , we measure complexity in terms of bits of information , i.e. 0s and 1s .
Second , instead of mathematical equations , we use binary computer programs .
Crucially , this enables us to compare the complexity of a scientific theory ( the computer program ) with the complexity of the data that it explains ( the output of the computer program , the location of our ink stains ) .
As Leibniz observed , for any data there is always a complicated theory , which is a computer program that is the same size as the data .
But that does n't count .
It is only a real theory if there is compression , if the program is much smaller than its output , both measured in 0/1 bits .
And if there can be no proper theory , then the bit string is called algorithmically random or irreducible .
That 's how you define a random string in algorithmic information theory .
Let 's look at our ink stains again .
To know where each spot is , rather than writing down its precise location , you 're much better off remembering the four pieces of information .
They give a very efficient theory which explains the data .
But what if you place the ink spots in a truly random fashion , by looking away and flicking your pen ?
Then a computer program which can compute the location of each spot for you has no choice but to store the co-ordinates that give you each location .
It is just as long as its output and does n't simplify your data set at all .
In this case , there is no good theory , the data set is irreducible , or algorithmically random .
I should point out that Leibniz had the two key ideas that you need to get this modern definition of randomness , he just never made the connection .
For Leibniz produced one of the first calculating machines , which he displayed at the Royal Society in London , and he was also one of the first people to appreciate base - two binary arithmetic and the fact that everything can be represented using only 0s and 1s .
So , as Martin Davis argues in his book The Universal Computer : The Road from Leibniz to Turing , Leibniz was the first computer scientist , and he was also the first information theorist .
I am sure that Leibniz would have instantly understood and appreciated the modern definition of randomness .
I should also mention that A. N. Kolmogorov also proposed this definition of randomness .
He and I did this independently in 1965 .
Kolmogorov was at the end of his career , and I was a teenager at the beginning of my own career as a mathematician .
As far as I know , neither of us was aware of the Leibniz Discours .
But Kolmogorov never realized , as I did , that the really important application of these ideas was the new light that they shed on Gödel 's incompleteness theorem and on Alan Turing 's famous halting problem .
So let me tell you about that now .
I 'll tell you how my Omega number possesses infinite complexity and therefore cannot be explained by any finite mathematical theory .
This shows that in a sense there is randomness in pure mathematics , and that there cannot be any TOE .
Omega is so complex because its definition is based on an unsolvable problem —
Turing 's halting problem .
Let 's have a look at this now .
Turing 's halting problem
In 1936 , Alan Turing stunned the mathematical world by presenting a model for the first digital computer , which is today known as the Turing Machine .
And as soon as you start thinking about computer programs , you are faced with the following , very basic question : given any program , is there an algorithm , a sure - fire recipe , which decides whether the program will eventually stop , or whether it'll keep on running forever ?
Let 's look at a couple of examples .
Suppose your program consists of the instruction " take every number between 1 and 10 , add 2 to it and then output the result " .
It 's obvious that this program halts after 10 steps .
If , however , the instructions are " take a number x , which is not negative , and keep multiplying it by 2 until the result is bigger than 1 " , then the program will stop as long as the input x is not 0 .
If it is 0 , it will keep going forever .
In these two examples it is easy to see whether the program stops or not .
But what if the program is much more complicated ?
Of course you can simply run it and see if it stops , but how long should you wait before you decide that it does n't ?
A week , a month , a year ?
The basic question is whether there is a test which in a finite amount of time decides whether or not any given program ever halts .
And , as Turing proved , the answer is no .
What is Omega ?
Now , instead of looking at individual instances of Turing 's famous halting problem , you just put all possible computer programs into a bag , shake it well , pick out a program , and ask : " what is the probability that it will eventually halt ? " .
This probability is the number Omega .
An example will make this clearer : suppose that in the whole wide world there are only two programs that eventually halt , and that these programs , when translated into bit strings , are 11001 and 101 .
Picking one of these at random is the same as randomly generating these two bit strings .
You can do this by tossing a coin and writing down a 1 if heads comes up , and a 0 if tails comes up , so the probability of getting a particular bit is 1 / 2 .
This means that the probability of getting 11001 is
So the probability of randomly choosing one of these two programs is
Alan Turing
Of course , in reality there are a lot more programs that halt , and Omega is the sum of lots of terms of the form Also , when defining Omega , you have to make certain restrictions on which types of programs are valid , to avoid counting things twice , and to make sure that Omega does not become infinitely large .
Anyway , once you do things properly you can define a halting probability Omega between zero and one .
Omega is a perfectly decent number , defined in a mathematically rigorous way .
The particular value of Omega that you get depends on your choice of computer programming language , but its surprising properties do n't depend on that choice .
Why is Omega irreducible ?
And what is the most surprising property of Omega ?
It 's the fact that it is irreducible , or algorithmically random , and that it is infinitely complex .
I 'll try to explain why this is so : like any number we can , theoretically at least , write Omega in binary notation , as a string of 0s and 1s .
In fact , Omega has an infinite binary expansion , just as the square root of two has an infinite decimal expansion
Now the square root of two can be approximated to any desired degree of accuracy by one of many algorithms .
Newton 's iteration , for example , uses the formula
to create a string of numbers which get closer and closer to the square root of two .
Start with an initial value , sayPluginto the equation to getRepeat , plugginginto the equation to getAnd again : A computer program which contains this " recursive " formula and the starting value 1 can slowly chomp through the calculations and eventually compute an approximation which is as accurate as we'd like it to be .
And having a good approximation means knowing a great number of the digits in the decimal expansion of the square root of two , so , given enough time , thisprogram can compute any one of the infinitely many digits in the decimal expansion of the square root of two .
Is there a similar finite program that can compute all the bits in the binary expansion of Omega ?
Well , it turns out that knowing the first bits of Omega gives you a way of solving the halting problem for all programs up to bits in size .
So , since you have a finite program that can work out all bits of Omega , you also have a finite program that can solve the halting problem for all programs , no matter what size .
But this , as we know , is impossible .
So such a program cannot exist .
According to our definition above , Omega is irreducible , or algorithmically random .
It can not be compressed into a smaller , finite theory .
Even though Omega has a very precise mathematical definition , its infinitely many bits cannot be captured in a finite program — they are just as " bad " as a string of infinitely many bits chosen at random .
In fact , Omega is maximally unknowable .
Even though it is precisely defined once you specify the programming language , its individual bits are maximally unknowable , maximally irreducible .
Why does maths have no TOEs ?
This question is now easy to answer .
A mathematical theory consists of a set of " axioms " — basic facts which we perceive to be self - evident and which need no further justification — and a set of rules about how to draw logical conclusions .
So a Theory of Everything would be a set of axioms from which we can deduce all mathematical truths and derive all mathematical objects .
It would also have to have finite complexity , otherwise it would n't be a theory .
Since it 's a TOE it would have to be able to compute Omega , a perfectly decent mathematical object .
The theory would have to provide us with a finite program which contains enough information to compute any one of the bits in Omega 's binary expansion .
But this is impossible because Omega , as we 've just seen , is infinitely complex — no finite program can compute it .
There is no theory of finite complexity that can deduce Omega .
So this is an area in which mathematical truth has absolutely no structure , no structure that we will ever be able to appreciate in detail , only statistically .
The best way of thinking about the bits of Omega is to say that each bit has probability 1 / 2 of being zero and probability 1 / 2 of being one , even though each bit is mathematically determined .
That 's where Turing 's halting problem has led us , to the discovery of pure randomness in a part of mathematics .
I think that Turing and Leibniz would be delighted at this remarkable turn of events .
Gödel 's incompleteness theorem tells us that within mathematics there are statements that are unknowable , or undecidable .
Omega tells us that there are in fact infinitely many such statements : whether any one of the infinitely many bits of Omega is a 0 or a 1 is something we cannot deduce from any mathematical theory .
More precisely , any maths theory enables us to determine at most finitely many bits of Omega .
Where does this leave us ?
Now I 'd like to make a few comments about what I see as the philosophical implications of all of this .
These are just my views , and they are quite controversial .
For example , even though a recent critical review of two of my books in the Notices of the American Mathematical Society does not claim that there are any technical mistakes in my work , the reviewer strongly disagrees with my philosophical conclusions , and in fact he claims that my work has no philosophical implications whatsoever .
So these are just my views , they are certainly not a community consensus , not at all .
Is maths an experimental science ?
My view is that Omega is a much more disagreeable instance of mathematical incompleteness than the one found by Gödel in 1931 , and that it therefore forces our hand philosophically .
In what way ?
Well , in my opinion , in a quasi-empirical direction , which is a phrase coined by Imre Lakatos when he was doing philosophy in England after leaving Hungary in 1956 .
In my opinion , Omega suggests that even though maths and physics are different , perhaps they are not as different as most people think .
To put it bluntly , if the incompleteness phenomenon discovered by Gödel in 1931 is really serious — and I believe that Turing 's work and my own work suggest that incompleteness is much more serious than people think — then perhaps mathematics should be pursued somewhat more in the spirit of experimental science rather than always demanding proofs for everything .
Maybe , rather than attempting to prove results such as the celebrated Riemann hypothesis , mathematicians should accept that they may not be provable and simply accept them as an axiom .
At any rate , that 's the way things seem to me .
Perhaps by the time we reach the centenary of Turing 's death in 2054 , this quasi-empirical view will have made some headway , or perhaps instead these foreign ideas will be utterly rejected by the immune system of the maths community .
For now they certainly are rejected .
But the past fifty years have brought us many surprises , and I expect that the next fifty years will too , a great many indeed .

A rebuilt house in the Lakeview area of New Orleans shows the raised level that complies with suggested FEMA guidelines .
WASHINGTON  Thousands of homes in New Orleans are at risk from floods because local officials let their owners skirt rebuilding requirements aimed at preventing massive losses and billions in costs to taxpayers .
In New Orleans , city records show at least 2,300 homeowners — many in areas obliterated by Hurricane Katrina and imperiled again this month as Hurricane Gustav strained at the city 's levees — escaped requirements that they elevate their homes .
That was common across the coast , as officials faced intense pressure to rebuild quickly , says Shirley Laska , director of the University of New Orleans ' Center for Hazards Assessment , Response and Technology .
Federal inspectors found examples of homeowners evading elevation requirements as far away as Alabama .
If homeowners do n't elevate , " it 's the federal taxpayers who pay to fix it , time after time , " says Larry Larson , head of the Association of State Floodplain Managers .
That 's because the owners still qualify for flood insurance .
The 2005 hurricanes caused so much damage that the insurance program needed $ 20 billion from taxpayers .
Flood insurance rules require that homes badly damaged by Katrina be elevated — by a few feet in some places to more than 10 feet in others — to protect them in the future .
A 2006 report by the Homeland Security Department 's inspector general said that after Katrina , local officials often lowered homeowners ' damage estimates below the level that would require them to elevate , often without proof that the changes were appropriate .
At the same time , even homeowners who want to raise their houses are having trouble paying .
Louisiana has so far spent less than 10 % of the $ 1.75 billion the federal government gave the state to elevate homes damaged by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita three years ago .
" If you want to be safe … you need to elevate , " says Jim Stark , head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency 's Gulf Coast Recovery Office .
That experience should be a warning to communities in Texas as they begin rebuilding after Hurricane Ike , says Jane Bullock , FEMA 's chief of staff during the 1990s .
Some Louisiana homeowners did n't want to elevate because they trust the region 's levees , says Larson of the managers group .
Others are worried homes on stilts wo n't look good .
Some are n't required to have flood insurance .
And elevating a house can be slow and expensive , adding $ 30,000 or more to the cost of rebuilding .
Exactly how many homeowners escaped elevation requirements is unclear .
K.C. King , who lives in New Orleans '
Gentilly section , says about 125 of his neighbors have rebuilt , but only about a dozen raised their homes .
" If that 's not a portrait of failure , I do n't know what is , " he said .

In Russia they have Super Mario Ladas .
Have you ever heard that before ?
Well , I have .
It was in Petra , Jordan over the summer .
Everyone outside the US realizes the US dollar is collapsing and will only sink further into the abyss .
The people in Petra will not exchange goods for US dollars .
Open your wallet and look at one of the pieces of paper .
What does it say on the top ?
It should say " Federal Reserve Note " aka an FRN .
FRN's are very different from dollars in the traditional sense .
Dollars , prior to 1971 , were backed by gold and silver , hence the silver dollar - a real dollar .
The people knew that the dollar was as good as gold or silver .
After 1971 when Nixon closed the gold window , the dollar went into free fall and moved ever closer to its intrinsic value of zero .
Today you need about 20 FRS to get one US dollar ( silver dollar ) .
Note : the paper market has decoupled from the physical one .
Search " silver eagle " on eBay and get the physical price .
Go to kitco.com and get the paper price .
I say " to get " and not " buy " because " buying " is a misnomer .
I no longer think in terms of buying things .
You are simply exchanging FRNs for goods and services or gold for goods and services .
I now see all exchange for goods and services as a ratio , such as FRN / pizza or Gold / Oil .
As the Federal Reserve prints money to bail out their pals on Wall Street , m any just say it 's just inflation , the increase in the money supply .
It 's actually much more insidious that just inflation .
It is an orchestrated scheme to debase the US currency and the owners of the privately held Federal Reserve Bank are responsible .
The biggest secret is that the FRNs you have are only worth the paper they are written on .
They are a fiat currency backed by nothing .
As Voltaire said : " Paper money eventually returns to its intrinsic value - zero . "
The fact that people still exchange goods and services for FRNs is a mystery .
As banks and other financial institutions fail and get bought or bailed out at the US tax payer and FRN holder 's expense , the world must realize that root of America 's cancer is the Federal Reserve Bank and the system that it controls .
The politicians and Hank Paulson are co-conspirators , but they are not the root of the problem .
Additionally , it 's not sacrificial lamb Ben Bernanke who is at fault either .
It is the owners of the privately held Federal Reserve B ank , which is not Federal nor does it have any reserves .
The owners are David Rockefeller , the Rothschilds , Warburgs , Lazards and others .
The Federal Reserve Bank of NY controls the printing press .
They determine the rate of inflation , which is now around 12 % an increasing ( see shadowstats.com ) .
The government calculation of inflation has been changed over the years to mask reality .
The deception reached epic proportions when the Fed stopped reporting M3 in 2006 .
There are some that still think Warren Buffett or Bill Gates are the richest people in the world .
The true story is that David Rockefeller and the Rockefeller Family are much more wealthy and powerful than either Buffett or Gates .
Rockefeller owns the printing press .
They are as rich as they want to be .
Billionaires , trillionaires , quadrillionaires , it really does n't matter .
David Rockefeller can just print as much money as he needs .
I think Thomas Jefferson summed it up nicely when he said in 1802 in a letter to then Secretary of the Treasury , Albert Gallatin : “ If the American people ever allow private banks ( Federal Reserve ) to control the issue of their money , first by inflation and then by deflation , the banks and corporations that will grow up around them ( around the banks ) , will deprive the people of their property until their children will wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered . ”
Next time you go to exchange your FRNs for something , think to yourself what if they would n't accept them like they did in Petra and many other places around the world .
What would that mean for life in America .
Boileau , a consultant with Immunity Inc. , said he did not release the tool publicly in 2006 because " Microsoft was a little cagey about exactly whether Firewire memory access was a real security issue or not and we did n't want to cause any real trouble " .
But now that a couple of years have passed and the issue has not resolved , Boileau decided to release the tool on his website .
To use the tool , hackers must connect a Linux - based computer to a Firewire port on the target machine .
The machine is then tricked into allowing the attacking computer to have read and write access to its memory .
With full access to the memory , the tool can then modify Windows ' password protection code , which is stored there , and render it ineffective .
Older desktop computers do not come equipped with Firewire ports , which are needed for the hack to work , but many recent models do .
Most laptops made in the last few years include Firewire ports .
Paul Ducklin , head of technology for security firm Sophos , said the security hole found by Boileau was not a vulnerability or bug in the traditional sense , because the ability to use the Firewire port to access a computer 's memory was actually a feature of Firewire .
" If you have a Firewire port , disable it when you are n't using it , " Ducklin said .
" That way , if someone does plug into your port unexpectedly , your side of the Firewire link is dead , so they can't interact with your PC , legitimately or otherwise . "
Ducklin also advised people to be careful when giving others physical access to their computer .
" I know people who'd think three times about asking passing strangers to take their photo in front of the Opera House in case they did a runner with the camera , yet who are much more casual with their laptop PC , as long as it's software - locked , even though the hardware alone is worth five times as much as the camera , " he said .

US President George W Bush has explained the credit crunch savaging US financial markets by saying " Wall Street got drunk " .
" It got drunk and now it 's got a hangover , " Mr Bush said at a private political fundraiser in Houston , Texas .
Members of the media were not invited and the audience had been asked to turn off their cameras .
But somebody recorded the statement on a mobile phone video camera and it was posted on the internet .
' Fancy instruments '
The comment was made on Friday and by Tuesday had found its way on to the internet .
" The question is , how long will it sober up and not try to do all these fancy financial instruments ? " the president asks in the clip .
The White House has issued a more prosaic explanation of his comments .
" He has said before that Wall Street was dealing with very complex financial instruments and that the markets did n't fully understand the risks that those instruments posed to the system , " said spokeswoman Dana Perino .
" It is certainly a more colourful way of saying what he said before , but he 's described it that way before in terms of his observations of what happened to the market , " she said .
Financial markets in the US and across the world have been thrown into turmoil as banks have discovered that many American home owners cannot afford to repay the mortgages that have been collected into complex bundles sold in stock markets .
The revelations have fed into panic in world financial markets that have led to sharp falls in share prices and a reluctance among banks to lend money - the credit crunch .
In the video , Mr Bush tells the crowd : " We 've got a housing issue .
" Not in Houston , evidently not in Dallas , because Laura 's over there trying to buy a house today , " he says to the crowd 's laughter .
Mr Bush said they were looking for somewhere to live when they leave Washington , DC , as Mrs Bush no longer wanted to live on their ranch in Crawford , Texas .

GRUB bootloader - Full tutorial
Updated : September 13 , 2007 ; November 30 , 2017
This tutorial focuses on GRUB legacy .
If you 're looking for a tutorial on GRUB 2 , the next generation of the popular bootloader , please take a look at this article .
One of the most frightening things about Linux is the horrible word bootloader .
The primary reason for this is the fact that most new Linux users have only ever used Windows operating systems .
In the Windows world , they have never bothered with bootloaders .
For them , the issue of a system booting was a transparent one .
At most , they would use Windows Recovery Console to fix problems for them .
Thus , they have been spared the need to learn about the single most important piece of software on a computer - the little program that makes it all work .
This article is supposed to provide you with basic understanding of the GRUB bootloader .
If you have read my other Linux articles , you are familiar with partitioning and Linux notation , as well as with the command line .
The next logical step is to enhance this knowledge by taking one step further .
Understanding how GRUB works and what boot entries in the boot menu mean will help you understand how the operating systems work , how to fix , recover or modify the GRUB menu to suit your needs , and how to setup different work environments with several operating systems .
In the past , we have relied on the installation setups to make the hard work for us .
In fact , setting up GRUB , while frightening , is a quite simple and fully reversible procedure .
Mastering the GRUB is a very important step in building up the confidence to use Linux .
So if you are ready , read on .
But first of all , a foreword of wisdom .
This article is a compilation of sources and examples that will help you learn about GRUB .
Of course , it 's all out there somewhere , on the Internet .
However , new Linux users will probably find the notion of spending hours searching for relevant pieces of information ( especially if their PC wo n't boot ) somewhat frustrating .
The goal of this guide is to help provide simple and quick solutions to most common problems regarding multi-boot setups and installation of Linux operating systems .

Everything is a file
To be able to successfully master the secrets of GRUB , you must understand one of the basic foundations of * NIX - based operating systems .
Everything is a file .
Even hard disks and partitions are treated as files .
There is no magic .
If you remember this , you will find the supposedly perilous task of tampering with partitions no different than playing with files using a file explorer ( or the command line ) .
Now that we have established this , we can move on to the more technical parts of grubbing .
Introduction
GNU GRUB is a bootloader ( can also be spelled boot loader ) capable of loading a variety of free and proprietary operating systems .
GRUB will work well with Linux , DOS , Windows , or BSD .
GRUB stands for GRand Unified Bootloader .
GRUB is dynamically configurable .
This means that the user can make changes during the boot time , which include altering existing boot entries , adding new , custom entries , selecting different kernels , or modifying initrd .
GRUB also supports Logical Block Address mode .
This means that if your computer has a fairly modern BIOS that can access more than 8GB ( first 1024 cylinders ) of hard disk space , GRUB will automatically be able to access all of it .
GRUB can be run from or be installed to any device ( floppy disk , hard disk , CD - ROM , USB drive , network drive ) and can load operating systems from just as many locations , including network drives .
It can also decompress operating system images before booting them .
You can learn much , much more from the official GNU GRUB Manual 0.97 .
What about LILO ?
You may have heard about another Linux bootloader called LILO ( stands for LInux LOader ) .
While a sensible option for many Linux users , I believe that GRUB is a better choice , for several reasons :
LILO supports only up to 16 different boot selections ; GRUB supports an unlimited number of boot entries .
LILO cannot boot from network ; GRUB can .
LILO must be written again every time you change the configuration file ; GRUB does not .
LILO does not have an interactive command interface .
All in all , it seems that GRUB is the winner .
So let 's see what this baby can do .
How does GRUB work ?
When a computer boots , the BIOS transfers control to the first boot device , which can be a hard disk , a floppy disk , a CD - ROM , or any other BIOS - recognized device .
We 'll concentrate on hard disks , for the sake of simplicity .
The first sector on a hard is called the Master Boot Record ( MBR ) .
This sector is only 512 bytes long and contains a small piece of code ( 446 bytes ) called the primary boot loader and the partition table ( 64 bytes ) describing the primary and extended partitions .
By default , MBR code looks for the partition marked as active and once such a partition is found , it loads its boot sector into memory and passes control to it .
GRUB replaces the default MBR with its own code .
Furthermore , GRUB works in stages .
Stage 1 is located in the MBR and mainly points to Stage 2 , since the MBR is too small to contain all of the needed data .
Stage 2 points to its configuration file , which contains all of the complex user interface and options we are normally familiar with when talking about GRUB .
Stage 2 can be located anywhere on the disk .
If Stage 2 cannot find its configuration table , GRUB will cease the boot sequence and present the user with a command line for manual configuration .
Stage 1.5 also exists and might be used if the boot information is small enough to fit in the area immediately after MBR .
The Stage architecture allows GRUB to be large ( ~20-30 K ) and therefore fairly complex and highly configurable , compared to most bootloaders , which are sparse and simple to fit within the limitations of the Partition Table .
GRUB notation
This section is intended to help you get familiar with GRUB , without touching anything .
The next section deals with actual files and manual configuration .
GRUB has its own notation , which is very similar yet somewhat different from the general notation a typical Linux user might be used to .
Now , here 's an example of a typical GRUB entry :
( hd0,1 )
The brackets are a must ; all devices listed in GRUB menu must be enclosed in brackets .
are a must ; all devices listed in GRUB menu must be enclosed in brackets .
hd stands for hard disk ; alternatively , fd stands for floppy disk , cd stands for CD - ROM etc .
stands for hard disk ; alternatively , stands for floppy disk , stands for CD - ROM etc .
The first number ( integer for geeks ) refers to the physical hard drive number ; in this case , the first drive , as they are counted from zero up .
For example , hd2 refers to the third physical hard drive .
( integer for geeks ) refers to the ; in this case , the drive , as they are counted from up .
For example , refers to the .
The second number refers to the partition number of the selected hard drive ; again , partitions are counted from zero up .
In this case , 1 stands for the second partition .
From here , it is evident that GRUB ( menu ) does not discriminate between IDE or SCSI drives or primary or logical partitions .
The task of deciding which hard drive or partition may boot is left to BIOS and Stage 1 .
As you see , the notation is very simple .
Primary partitions are marked from 0 to 3 ( hd ? ,0 ) , ( hd ? , 1 ) , ( hd ? , 2 ) , ( hd ? , 3 ) .
Logical partitions in the extended partition are counted from 4 up , regardless of the actual number of primary partitions on the hard disk , e.g. ( hd 1,7 ) .
The entries alone are not enough to boot an operating system though .
GRUB also needs to know what operating system images to load .
These are assigned as parameters to each of the called devices , including special flags ( switches ) .
For example , Windows Safe Mode is a special flag .
Here is an example of a GRUB menu booting only Ubuntu .
Here 's an example of a GRUB menu from a computer with triple boot ( SUSE 10.2 , Ubuntu 6.10 and Windows XP ) .
This is the actual menu.lst on one of my real machines .
Let 's try to understand what the entries mean .
Only uncommented lines count .
Comments are marked with # .
The lines that have a series of small gray xs showing are in indication that text therein belongs to the line preceding it .
In other words , there text simply dropped to another line to visually accommodate the text editor and screen resolution limitations .
default 0
timeout 8
The first line ( default 0 ) means that the first operating system listed will be booted .
In this case , it 's SUSE 10.2 .
The second line ( timeout 8 ) tells how much time ( seconds ) the user has to make his choice before the default entry is loaded .
Simple , is n't it ?
gfxmenu ( hd0,2 ) / boot / message
The GRUB menu can also be graphic .
The fancy stuff needed to present the user with a colorful background and possibly some extras is located on the first physical disk , third partition ( hd0,2 ) .
This is a primary partition , as we have seen earlier .
title openSUSE 10.2
root ( hd0,2 )
kernel / boot / vmlinuz -...
initrd / boot / initrd.img -...
This is the first operating system entry in the menu .
title is as simple as it sounds .
It 's merely a string that 's meant to help the user read the menu in human terminology .

root ( hd0,2 ) tells GRUB where its configuration files are located .
In this instance , they can be found under ( hd0,2 ) / boot / grub .

kernel / boot / vmlinuz -... boots the actual kernel image .
There can be many such images available .
The fact there is no device specified before the / boot / vmlinuz indicates the image is located on the same partition as the GRUB itself .
This is often the default case for your primary choice of operating system .

The fact there is no device specified before the indicates the image is located on the partition as the GRUB itself .
This is often the default case for your primary choice of operating system .
initrd / boot /initrd.img -... is the temporary file system that makes system preparations - adapts generic kernel image to specific hardware - before the real root is loaded .
The extra switches used after the kernel indicate where the actual root is located , what graphic mode is used and where the swap partition resides .
This article will not go into detail regarding the more advanced GRUB configurations .
title Ubuntu , kernel ... ( / dev/sda9 )
kernel ( hd0,8 ) /boot/ vmlinuz -...
initrd ( hd0,8 ) /boot/initrd.img -...
Again , title indicates a name , in this case fancily adorned with technical details .
indicates a name , in this case fancily adorned with technical details .
kernel ( hd0,8 )/boot/vmlinuz -... points to the 9th partition on the first hard disk ( hd0,8 ) .
Accidentally , the root flag ( / dev/sda9 ) indicates that the root partition is the same as the one containing the kernel image .
Normally , this is the case , and for the sake of simplicity , you will want this option during your installations .
points to the partition on the hard disk .
Accidentally , the root flag indicates that the root partition is the as the one containing the kernel image .
Normally , this is the case , and for the sake of simplicity , you will want this option during your installations .
initrd ( hd0,8)/boot/initrd.img -... nothing new here .
Note regarding kernel images and root partitions :
On older computers with BIOS that do not support access to more than the first 1024 cylinders , you might setup a boot partition that contains the kernel image , while the root itself is located elsewhere .
But people with computers younger than the botched Y2 K crisis need not worry .
Another thing you might notice is that the Ubuntu entry is fairly detailed .
This feature is called Multi - boot Compliance ; openSUSE recognizes Ubuntu and can accurately call its images ( including special switches ) and mount the partitions .
However , most operating systems are only partially multi-boot compliant .
A little later on , I will show you how the Ubuntu entry could have been treated differently , with the same results .
title Windows
rootnoverify ( hd0,0 )
chainloader ( hd0,0 ) +
1
rootnoverify ( hd0,0 ) means that openSUSE cannot understand Windows operating system , i.e. no multi- boot compliance .
Therefore , the operating system is called without any fore - knowledge of the kernel .
GRUB assumes that the relevant boot images will be found on the target partition and mounted by the other operating system bootloader .
As you can see , Windows was installed on the first partition of the first hard disk .
This is the most convenient option .

As you can see , Windows was installed on the partition of the hard disk .
This is the most convenient option .
chainloader ( hd0,0 ) + 1 feature is used for operating systems that cannot be booted directly .
Not surprisingly , Windows operating systems cannot be booted directly .
They are booted by the method of chainloading .
As the name implies , GRUB passes the control of the boot sequence to another bootloader , located on the device to which the menu entry points .
This can be a Windows operating system , but also any other , including Linux .
Back to Ubuntu .
You remember that I have told we could have booted Ubuntu in an alternative way ?
Indeed , we could have simply chainloaded it , just like Windows .
title Ubuntu
root ( hd0,8 )
chainloader ( hd0,8 ) +
1
This would have worked equally well .
The last option in the menu allows you to boot SUSE in the failsafe mode ( sort of Safe Mode , no graphics ) and does not contribute to our knowledge , therefore we will skip it at the moment .
Let 's see some more examples .
The example below is actually written in the Ubuntu menu.lst ( commented , of course ) .
title Windows 95/98/NT/2000
root ( hd0,0 )
makeactive
chainloader +1
title Linux
root ( hd0,1 )
kernel /vmlinuz root= / dev/hda3 ro
By now , you should be able to " read " GRUB language with ease .
We begin with the title .
root specifies the partition where we expect to find the Windows kernel and mounts it ( rootnoverify would leave this job to the Windows bootloader ) .
makeactive command sets the active partition on the root disk ( above ) to GRUB root device .
This means that the next command , chainloader , is executed without the target partition specified ( as the target partition is the same , now ) .
The second entry is even simpler .
We name a Linux , we call its partition and we boot the kernel .
In this case , we see the very interesting case where the kernel image and root ( / ) partition of the operating system are NOT located on the same partition .
This would be a very likely case for older computers - or ones with a specific boot partition .
Finally , the crazy stuff : A GRUB menu booting 100 + systems of DOS , Windows , Linux , BSD , and Solaris .
You see , it 's very simple !
Once you get the hang of it , it actually becomes fun .
For more information , you must read the GNU GRUB Manual 0.97 .
In particular , you need to familiar with The list of command line and menu entry commands .
GRUB configuration
Most of the time , you will not want or need to touch GRUB .
When you install operating systems , especially in the right sequence ( inconsiderate OS first - like Windows , flexible OS later - Linux and family ) , the GRUB will be installed automatically and relevant entries appended .
Nevertheless , you should know when and what to do if things go wrong .
Installation of GRUB
GRUB can be installed to a variety of devices .
Most people will be interested in setting up GRUB on their hard disk .
Nevertheless , it does not hurt to know learn about other options .
Of course , you can skip forward .
Before we install anything , we need to know where our files are .
If installed , GRUB menu is located on the root partition under :
/ boot/grub/menu.lst
Always , always back this file up before making any changes !
The GRUB files can be found in the image of your operating system ( usually a CD ) , under :
/usr/lib/grub/i386-pc
You should also be aware of the basic Linux commands regarding the hard disks and partitions .
To this end , you might want to try my article Highly useful Linux commands & configurations .
Nevertheless , for those who do not fancy reading yet another article , here 's a brief version :
You can display your PC environment information either through terminal or a text editor .
Files through text editor are invoked by specifying the text editor and a target file ( with su or sudo for system files ) .
sudo vi /etc / fstab
OR
sudo gedit /etc/fstab
Alternatively , you can simply print the contents of the files in the terminal by using the cat ( concatenate ) command .
( sudo ) cat /etc / fstab
Some useful commands that one might need when dealing with boot , hard drives and partitions : Display the partition table :
fdisk -l
Display the mounted partitions :
cat /etc/fstab
Now that we know what we need and where to find it , it 's time to install GRUB .
GRUB on a floppy disk
To create GRUB on a floppy disk , we must copy the Stage 1 and Stage 2 files from the image directory to the first and second sector of the floppy disk .
We 'll use the dd command , which copies information sector by sector .
Here 's the set of commands that you need to execute ( taken from the Manual ) :
cd /usr/lib/grub/i386-pc
dd if=stage1 of= / dev/fd0 bs=512 count=1
dd if=stage2 of=/ dev/fd0 bs=512 seek=1
Just a short explanation : if stands for input file , of stands for output file , / dev / fd0 refers to the first mounted floppy device , bs specifies the block size ( in bytes ) , count instructs how many blocks should be copied , and seek tells how many blocks should be skipped before writing .
Not surprisingly , since we need to write the files to the first two sectors of the floppy disk , we write stage1 to the first sector , and copy stage2 to the second ( skip first , then write ) .
Now that we have taken this deep fancy for the command line , I 'll leave you with the nuances of different commands for homework .
More on dd on Wikipedia .
Regarding the GRUB on floppy , that 's it .
Since we have copies the stages from OS image , all of the required information is there .
Of course , you can always make manual adjustments .
But that 's the next chapter .
Installing GRUB natively
Native install means placing GRUB Stage 1 in the first sector of the hard disk ( MBR or Partition Table ) .
This means you will be able to boot without a secondary device , like a floppy disk ( which have become a rarity nowadays ) .
However , this also means that if you install an inconsiderate OS later on ( like Windows ) or try to repair the MBR for some reason ( by running fdisk / MBR from DOS prompt ) , you will erase the GRUB and render all systems listed in the menu.lst unbootable .
To install GRUB in MBR , you will need to boot from external media ( floppy , live Linux CD ) .
Then , once you reach the GRUB prompt , execute the following commands :
Find the GRUB root device :
find / boot / grub / stage1
GRUB will search for all available Stages 1 and present them .
If you have more than one operating system image present ( e.g. SUSE , Kubuntu , Mandriva ) , you will have more than one stage1 available .
Example - Let 's say the computer has the following operating systems installed on different partitions :
SUSE on ( hd0,1 )
on Kubuntu on ( hd0,2 )
on Mandriva on ( hd0,4 )
All these will be returned as potential roots for GRUB device ( as each OS has its own files ) .
If you wish to use SUSE GRUB , then you will setup the GRUB root device to ( hd0,1 ) :
root ( hd0,1 )
If you want Mandriva 's GRUB , then :
root ( hd0,4 )
If you know in advance what you want to do , you can skip the find command .
Once you have decided on the root , you need to write the information to the MBR :
setup ( hd0 )
Finally , quit the GRUB prompt :
quit
As a sequence , the commands that you need are :
find / boot / grub / stage1 ( optional )
root ( hdX , Y )
setup ( hd0 )
quit
You can also setup GRUB on another drive or partition , but then you will have to chainload GRUB to another bootloader for this to work .
That 's it .
Easy peasy orange squeasy !
Installing GRUB with grub - install
This method is considered less safe ( according to the Manual ) , as it guesses the mapping .
Still , for total newbs in need of dire help , this might be the preferred method .
You only need to invoke a single command - namely , where to install the bootloader .
Furthermore , this command can be written in several ways , all equivalent :
grub-install / dev/hda
grub -install / dev/hd0
grub -install ' ( hd0 ) '
grub - install hd0
After you have installed the GRUB , your operating systems should boot .
Once booted , you can once again start playing with GRUB , manually changing settings - adding and removing entries , chainloading other bootloaders , or even hiding and unhiding partitions .
Setting up GRUB manually ( after installation )
You can reconfigure or reinstall GRUB at any moment .
First , before you make any changes to the GRUB configuration file , it is most warmly recommended that you backup the existing menu .
You might even consider copying to another machine or printing the menu , in case things go bunkerous .
cp /boot / grub/menu.lst /boot/grub/menu.lst_backup
To access GRUB , execute the following command in Linux terminal :
sudo grub
After a few moments , the GRUB command line should show up .
You can identify it by the grub > prompt .
Alternatively , you can reach the GRUB command line during bootup .
When the GRUB menu loads , press C on the keyboard .
Adding a new operating system to the GRUB menu
Let 's say you have installed yet another operating system on your machine , Sabayon .
During the installation , you skip the GRUB setup .
This means that the original GRUB remains untouched - and it does not contain an entry about Sabayon .
For all practical purposes , Sabayon is not bootable .
Note : GRUB menu entries are called stanzas ( probably a twist of instance ? ) .
So , we need to add Sabayon to the list .
If you know where Sabayon is installed , you just need to add its entry to the menu.lst .
title Sabayon
root ( hdX , Y )
chainloader +1
That 's it .
You can also do this while booting the computer , without editing the menu .
When the original GRUB comes up , press C to reach the command line .
And then :
root ( hdX , Y )
chainloader +1
Optionally , you will use the find command to get around .
Basically , this is the whole of GRUB magic .
As you can see , it 's very very simple .
But for people who have never heard of GRUB and see long lists of strange commands , the prospect can be daunting .
Now that we have covered the basics of grubbing , it 's time for extras and some more common problems .
Common problems
GRUB got deleted ; how to restore ?
This will often happen if you install Windows after Linux .
Windows assumes it 's the only operating system in the world and does not try to live with existing information present in the MBR ; it overwrites it .
For people with dual - boot and very little knowledge of Linux , this is a disaster .
Luckily , it 's very easily recoverable one .
The easy way
Use Super Grub Disk .
I have written about this tool in detail in my article A ( cool ) list of Linux tools , under Rescue .
The hard way
Boot from floppy disk or CD ( any Linux live CD should do ) .
Get to the grub command line .
find / boot / grub / stage1 ( optional )
root ( hdX , Y )
setup ( hd0 )
quit
The same as before !
Windows is installed on a non-first hard disk ( Swapping )
GRUB cannot directly boot Microsoft operating systems .
And sometimes , even chainloading may not work , especially if Windows is not installed on the first hard disk .
Once again , you should remember that you should always install Windows first , on the first hard disk , on the first partition ( the rule of three first ) .
Nevertheless , even if you have Windows installed on a separate disk , you can solve the problem by swapping .
You need to perform a virtual swap between hard disks .
Like this :
map ( hd0 ) ( hd1 )
map ( hd1 ) ( hd0 )
After you add these two lines , you should be able to boot into Windows ( or DOS , for that matter ) .
There is more than one Windows operating system installed on one hard disk ( Hide / Unhide )
Again , Windows can cause problems if there 's more than one instance present on a hard disk , especially if installed on primary partitions .
When you use the chainloader command , the control is transferred to the Windows boot loader , but which one ?
The problem is easily solved by hiding and unhiding partitions .
If GRUB hides a partition , it will not be visible by Windows and prevent a possible confusion .
Vice versa , if you unhide a partition , Windows will detect it and be able to boot from it , without getting confused .
Here 's the example taken from the Manual that demonstrates this point .
Let 's say we have Windows installed on the first and the second partition of your hard disk .
We wish to boot the first instance of Windows .
Then , we need to execute the following set of commands to make it all work :
unhide ( hd0,0 )
hide ( hd0,1 )
rootnoverify ( hd0,0 )
chainloader +1
makeactive
You resized a partition ; GRUB is gone
This is an interesting case .
It can happen after you use a partitioning or an imaging software to make changes to the Partition Table .
Usually , this will happen when you make such a change in Windows .
Linux will not be informed of the change , because Windows is blind to anything else on the machine save Microsoft thingies .
Consequently , GRUB will suffer .
The solution is that most likely the filesystem is damaged and needs to be repaired .
Boot from a live CD and execute the following commands , assuming you know where Linux partitions are .
Check the filesystem :
fsck.ext2 /dev/hdXY
Replace X and Y with hard disk letter and partition number that you want to check ( hda2 , hdb3 , etc. ) .
Create the ext2/3 filesystem parameters again .
tune2fs -j /dev/hdXY
Now mount the root filesystem on / mnt / sysimage and run grub :
mount -t ext2 / dev/hdXY / mnt/ sysimage
OR
mount -t ext2 / dev/hdXY / mnt/ sysimage
cd /mnt/sysimage/sbin
grub
You 're back to the familiar grounds .
For more information on Linux commands , including fsck.ext2 , tune2fs and others , see Manual pages on Linux Reviews .

How to restore GRUB menu after Windows installation
How to identify the name of the boot drive ( hd0 , hd1 , hd2 , etc )

EliteXC has taken its lightweight title away from Karl James Noons , EliteXC Head of Fight Operations Jeremy Lappen announced Friday .
“ We are stripping KJ of his championship belt for refusing to defend against ( Nick ) Diaz , ” Lappen said in a news release .
“ It ’s a very unfortunate situation but we cannot have belt - holders who refuse to fight the top contenders .
We want champions who will fight anyone , anytime , anyplace .
That ’s the mentality all champions should have .
” The move is the latest in an ongoing battle between EliteXC and Noons , who captured the EliteXC belt when he stopped Diaz on a cut in November 2007 .
“ I do n’t understand why ( Noons ) would turn down a chance to be a headliner on CBS on Oct. 4 , ” Lappen said .
“ KJ then turned down the fight again when we offered him a headlining spot on our next Showtime date against Nick .
From my view , it is a fight against a top - named opponent in Diaz .
” In August , however , Noons told Sherdog.com that compensation was his central issue with EliteXC .
“ I always wanted to fight Nick Diaz , ” Noons had said .
“ It ’s the most marketable fight for me , the best style fight for me .
I think the fans want to see it .
But you have to pay for something you want to see .
…
It is about the money and how ( EliteXC was ) paying somebody I already beat three times more .
” Lappen said Friday that EliteXC would announce a fight for the vacant lightweight title in the near future . “ KJ has two more fights remaining on his contract , ” he said , “ so we are still looking forward to having him fight for us again soon , but not as our world champion . ”
I ’m considering voting for a major party ’s presidential ticket this year , for the first time in decades .
As a matter of fact , it would mark the first time I ’ve voted the top of the ticket for this particular party , in my life .
I ’ve met the presidential nominee .
He ’s got character .
He ’s also a likeable guy — most politicians share that asset — though he ’s clearly a creature of the Senate , where respect for freedom and limited government , for any set of philosophical principles that might lead one to refuse to spend tax dollars for purposes not specifically delegated in the Constitution , are laughed at , deemed a handicap in “ making the deal . ”
Over the past year , though , he ’s run a come - from - behind Cinderella campaign that could become the stuff of legend .
And then last week , he did something that made our enemies afraid .
That made me take notice .
For the enemy of my enemy is my friend .
Mind you , there ’s a good moral case to be made for not voting .
If you believe it ’s unconstitutional and morally wrong for anyone to send police officers to bust down the doors and murder the dogs and kill the occupants of houses where they believe someone may be in non-violent possession of the “ wrong ” kinds of medicinal plants or “ unlicensed ” firearms , you should be troubled to help choose which one of two ( or four ) people get to do that job .
By participating in the election , you tacitly acknowledge the winner has the right to do all the awful , unconstitutional , morally wrong things they now do in our names .
I still vote largely because the “ Libertarian ” button is available .
This year , though , the Libertarian Party has nominated Fearless Drug Warrior Bob Barr , a man who has opposed medical marijuana initiatives , opposed needle exchanges , a man who zealously locked up for years those seeking to peacefully medicate themselves or help others to do so , shoving them into small cages where they ’re subject to anal rape by guys named “ Bubba . ”
Does Mr. Barr now believe , with us Libertarians , that the War on Drugs is unconstitutional , as well as hopeless , counterproductive , and morally evil ?
If it ’s unconstitutional now , then it ’s never been constitutional , and efforts must be made to roll back its effects and compensate its surviving victims .
How much of Mr. Barr ’s ill - gotten fortune has he devoted to seeking releases , pardons , and financial restitution for the men he locked up on drug charges — including financial restitution for their stolen agricultural products ?
Has he even apologized ?
It ’s tempting to stay home on Nov. 4 .
But there ’s now at least a 50 - 50 possibility — higher , given Americans ’ demonstrated reluctance to elect ultra-socialist Big City senators over the past 40 years — that when Americans wake up Nov. 5 they ’ll rub their eyes and wonder what kind of a shuck job the Leftist Mainstream Press has spent the past year peddling them about some Chicago ward heeler whose silver tongue seemed to tie up pretty quick when he strayed from the prepared script and the Teleprompters , and how this same press corps largely missed the come - from behind Cinderella story of a guy they declared dead in the water in August of 2007 .
Wishing wo n’t make John McCain a small - government libertarian .
But think back to how the defeatist fellow - travelers in the media ridiculed him when he said The Surge could defeat al - Qaida in Iraq .
Think back to when the genius political analysts told you McCain ’s campaign was dead , that this guy was broke and so clueless he had no remaining plan but to spend the entire autumn in New Hampshire , hanging out and gabbing with the locals at Dunkin ’ Donuts .
And then last week my former senator , John McCain , threw the entire race into a maelstrom , confounding all expectations and common wisdom by choosing Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska as his running mate .
If Democrats believed what they say — that Gov. Palin is such a poor choice that John McCain might as well fold his tent and go home — they should be condescendingly patting the little lady on the head right now , saying , “ Oh , how cute . ”
So how are we to explain the way the Democratic Party is now going after Sarah Palin and her perfectly lovely pregnant daughter , for all the world like the frenzied final holdouts on some Japanese - occupied Pacific atoll , shrieking “ Banzai ! ” as they level their bayonets and charge the machine guns in their loincloths ?
I ’ve already lost count of the ways the ululating harridans have attacked this anti-corruption reformer .
She ca n’t be president because she lives too far from Washington .
Because she bore a child with Down ’s Syndrome instead of aborting him .
Because a woman with young children should n’t put them through the strain of a campaign for high office .
( Is the Democratic position now that only sterile old men should be president , or does that one apply only to women ? )
Her husband wants Alaska ’s federal land turned over to the state ( oh , the horror ! ) and had a DUI some decades back , before they were even married .
( I do n’t believe the Democrats actually used the phrase “ drunken Indian , ” any more than they specifically said a woman still of child - bearing age ca n’t be president because she might be irritable during “ that time of the month , ” though they sure went right up to the line .
My , how thin is their veneer of Political Correctness . )
Although her daughter plans to keep her baby and marry the father , Gov. Palin is n’t qualified to run for high office because her teen - age daughter is pregnant .
( This from the DEMOCRATS , mind you , who see no problem making it our national policy to subsidize repeat unwed births with your and my tax dollars whether we approve or not . )
Why the desperation ?
Because Vice President Sarah Palin would mean Americans could actually end up electing a woman president without tapping a manipulative , soulless , stay - married - just - to - stay - in - power socialist .
How DARE the Republicans threaten to do that ?
Only the “ progressive ” party is supposed to be allowed to put the first articulate woman in line for the White House !
Why , it ’s just like when the Republicans dared to put a CONSERVATIVE black man on the Supreme Court .
It ’s so WRONG !
Sarah Palin is a gun owner and Westerner who seems to still understand the core American notions of Freedom and the Frontier , a woman who vetoed a half billion dollars in proposed state spending and “ put the government of our state back on the side of the people . ”
Yes , it bothers me that she might outlaw other women ’s abortion choices if she could .
But she can’t .
What these screeching attacks on Sarah Palin are really all about is not a pregnant daughter or a 20 - year - old DUI .
And the “ no foreign policy experience ” red herring would have barred Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton as well as Barack Obama .
What this is really all about is that she is the first everyday American in generations , the first person who is not an Ivy League attorney , not a career Washington insider , not vetted by the Brookings Institution and the Council on Foreign Relations and the CIA and Ellen Goodman , a person who works her husband ’s fishing boat and drives her own car to work and buys her own groceries , to be given a shot at leading this nation .
And that appears to have a certain element of the political power structure terrified .
Why do you suppose that is ?
Gov. Sarah Palin can’t save American all by herself .
That ’s the underlying absurdity of this near - religious frenzy to pick a new Guy On A White Horse every eight years .
But an America that could elect Sarah Palin might still save itself .
That ’s why .
Because they know their guy ’s already absurd claim to be the best and only available “ agent of change ” ran out when he tapped graying political plagiarist Joe Biden — and John McCain decided to roll the dice and go the other way .
Because the chances are now better than even that when Barack Obama awakens on Nov. 5 , the song they ’ll be playing is “ We used to love him , but it ’s all over now . ”

Blogging is occasionally tossed out as a way of bringing in passive income .
But as someone who earns money blogging , I do n’t think this is quite accurate .
It ’d be better to describe it as a very involved source of income with a passive side .
How Blogging is Active
Pretty self - explanatory , right ?
At a minimum , you have to write posts .
Next , you probably respond to some comments and answer reader e-mails .
Then there ’s networking , blog optimizing , commenting , etc .
If you let it , blogging can easily eat hours out of your day .
Nothing passive about that .
If it were just the initial effort of setting up a blog and writing a few good posts , it would n’t be that bad .
But unlike a book , some good writing is n’t enough .
People will expect more every day .
I ’m ok with that because I like the conversational side of blogs , the relational side .
And most of the time I love writing too .
I do n’t expect it to be passive .
How You Make Passive Money Blogging
There are a number of ways to make money blogging .
The BlogHer ads on the right pay per impression ( page view ) .
The AdSense pays per click ( though regulars are not encouraged to click because AdSense is quite touchy about valid vs. invalid clicks ) .
There are links which pay a set amount each month just to advertise on the blog .
Or because they hope it ’ll get them higher rankings to be linked to by a site with a good page rank and whatnot .
Each of these has a strong passive element element .
For instance , a number of people visit my site every day because they ran a search and it pointed them to a relevant topic on my blog .
Their visit makes an “ impression . ”
They may also click on an ad and produce revenue there too .
They end up on pages I created in the past , pages I have nothing to do with now .
So that is passive , I just let the pages sit there and they earn some money .
Or people link to pages I created in the past , same result .
Then because my site has achieved a certain rank , people want to keep advertising on it .
That probably would n’t change if I simply stopped writing today .
I might not be able to renew them or find new ones , but some of the factors have n’t changed .
My site would still have a good rank .
Some bloggers stepped away from their blogs months ago and yet continue to make money from ads .
For them , blog income is truly passive .
But like retirement , making money off a blog requires an initial commitment .
The more you put in earlier ( more pages for people to find , more money in your 401 ( k ) , etc ) , the more you get out of it later .
Starting a blog wo n’t make you loads of money , but there is a certain passive element to appreciate .
It just wo n’t happen unless you put in a lot of effort first .

Children 's contests on television have become hugely popular The Indian government has proposed new guidelines to regulate children 's participation in reality TV shows .
Among them is a suggestion to fix the minimum age limit of contestants to 12 years .
Once approved , all broadcasters will have to follow the guidelines .
In the past few years , reality shows with children have become a huge hit with thousands queuing up to take part .
Recently , a young girl collapsed on the sets of a show and her parents alleged that the judges had reprimanded her .
Expert group
" We received several complaints about how children were being misused by reality television shows and how we were not doing enough to address the problem , " member of the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights ( NCPCR ) Sandhya Bajaj told the BBC .
The commission set up a working group with legal experts , child psychologists and educationists and they have recommended a set of guidelines .
" The experts have suggested that children below 12 years should not be allowed to participate in competitive programmes offering cash prizes on television .
Some experts even want to fix the minimum age at 16 .
" We are debating the issue and have asked for inputs from all sections of society .
We hope to finalise the guidelines by the end of October , " Ms Bajaj said .
At the moment , children as young as seven or eight participate in reality shows .
The guidelines also recommend that doctors and counsellors be present at all times on the sets to deal with emergencies .
The government wants to set some guidelines for children 's shows Authorities say they also want to regulate what the judges can - and cannot - say .
" The judges should not insult the children .
They must be careful about what they say to the participants .
They should not say anything which will make the children or their parents cry , " Ms Bajaj said .
The judges , like their counterparts on American Idol and other contests in the west , have sometimes been accused of being rude to the contestants to attract better viewer ratings .
In May , a girl participating in a dance show collapsed on the sets and her family alleged that she had been rebuked by the judges for her poor performance .
' Internal guidelines ' " We are really concerned .
We also watch the TV programmes and we see these children being pushed to the limit , " says Ms Bajaj .
Sony , producers of popular children 's show Boogie Woogie , say they have their own set of " internal guidelines " which they follow while working with young children .
" I do n't think we need any more guidelines , but as and when the government comes out with their proposals , we will look at them , " senior Sony official Albert Almeida told the BBC .
The suggestion to fix a minimum age has been welcomed by Dr Vrushali Deshmukh , whose 11 - year - old son has participated in a couple of music shows on television .
She says although participation in television shows gives children good exposure , she admits that shooting schedules can get hectic for young children .
" It 's good to fix the minimum age at 16 because then children are older and more mature .
They can take their own decisions .
" They can deal better with disappointments .
They are better equipped , both physically and mentally , to deal with the gruelling schedules , " she says .

What are these ?
Why study interruption ?
advertisement
advertisement
I became interested in it from my own personal experience .
I moved here from Europe back in 2000 .
I was stunned by the amount of multitasking that I was doing here in the U.S. and I was wondering if other people were experiencing it as well .
Anecdotally , people were reporting they were crushed by all of these different projects .
People ’s lives as information workers involve different kinds of technologies , and they create even more of a force for interruption and different places where we can focus our attention .
Is this the downside of the communications revolution ?
Interruptions are n’t necessarily all bad .
People report that some interruptions can be beneficial .
The downside is the stress that comes from switching topics so rapidly throughout the workday .
How often is the modern office worker interrupted ?
We had observers go into the workplace and we timed people ’s activities to the second .
We ’ve been to various workplaces , all high - tech companies .
We wanted to look at information workers .
We had observers shadow each person for three and a half days each and timed every activity to the second .
If they pick up a phone call , that ’s the start time .
When they put the phone down , that ’s the stop time .
When they turn to the Word application we get the start time and stop time .
We found people switched these activities on average of every three minutes and five seconds .
Roughly half of them are self - interruptions .
That ’s to me an endless source of fascination : why do people self - interrupt ?
I do that all the time .
advertisement
So it ’s not just somebody else interrupting us .
You ’re working on a report and suddenly you check Orbitz for airfares — that sort of thing ?
That ’s right .
Or you go to eBay .
For no apparent reason , the person picks up the phone and makes a call or starts surfing the Web .
When is interruption beneficial ?
If an interruption matches the topic of the current task at hand , then it ’s beneficial .
If you ’re working on task A and somebody comes in and interrupts you about exactly that task people report that ’s very positive and helps them think about task A .
There ’s been a lot of research into the psychology of problem solving that says if you let problems incubate , sometimes it helps in solving them .
A good example would be a software developer who just ca n’t trace a bug so they put it aside and let it incubate .
The answer may come back to the software developer later while he or she is working on another task .
This is an example of how switching tasks may be beneficial .
If interruptions are short they ’re usually not so bad .
Imagine you ’re working on this article and some one comes in and says , “ Here , can you sign this form ? ”
You sign it , it ’s a very subordinate kind of task and you go back to doing your work .
Any kind of automatic task that does n’t require a lot of thinking would not be a major disruption .
advertisement
When is interruption counterproductive ?
It ’s generally counterproductive if you ’re working on one task and you ’re interrupted on a completely different topic .
People have to shift their cognitive resources , or attentional resources , to a completely different topic .
You have to completely shift your thinking , it takes you a while to get into it and it takes you a while to get back and remember where you were .
You also found that people not only switched between small tasks but also between entire projects — a phone call and e-mail on one project , then jumping to a completely different topic .
We figured , maybe it ’s not so bad to switch activities within the same theme .
We clustered events — a phone call , a Word document — into similar contexts that we called working spheres .
We found that people switched those every 10 and half minutes .
Say you ’re a financial analyst working on the TX project , then the BC project , then planning the company picnic and then going back and work on this original TX project .
Do you believe this behavior is typical of knowledge workers ?
Yes .
These were people who were managers , financial analysts , software developers .
The only significant difference we found due to profession was that software developers spent a little bit more time on the PC before switching .
But it ’s not even that much time — something like four minutes as opposed to three minutes .
Other than that , we found no significant differences among professions .
advertisement
How long does it take people to get back on task ?
We found about 82 percent of all interrupted work is resumed on the same day .
But here ’s the bad news — it takes an average of 23 minutes and 15 seconds to get back to the task .
What are the psychological costs of all this switching ?
We found there is significantly more stress .
We did a laboratory experiment where people did a typical office task : they had to answer a set of e-mail .
In one condition , they were not interrupted .
In another condition , we interrupted them with phone calls and IM .
We used a NASA workload scale , which measures various dimensions of stress , and we found that people scored significantly higher when interrupted .
They had higher levels of stress , frustration , mental effort , feeling of time pressure and mental workload .
So that ’s the cost .
There was no significant difference in number of errors between those who were interrupted and those who were not .
But I ’ll tell you something very interesting that we found — when people were not interrupted they worked slower .
Here ’s how we interpret that — when people know they can expect interruption they get into a mode of working faster to compensate .
You know you ’re going to be continually interrupted so you compensate by working faster , but the cost of that is stress .
How do you explain the stress ?
advertisement
It ’s a feeling of just not being able to keep up .
There was very high powered lawyer on the east coast who told me that every Sunday morning he wakes up before the rest of his family , clears off the dining room table , lays out all his casework and spends the entire Sunday just catching up on what he was n’t able to complete during the week .
That ’s another dimension — the inability to just get away from work and take a break .
It ’s what I call invisible work : the work that your colleagues and managers do n’t see , the extra work you have to get done just to keep up with the demands of the workplace .
Are we becoming more superficial thinkers ?
I argue that when people are switching contexts every 10 and half minutes they can’t possibly be thinking deeply .
There ’s no way people can achieve flow .
When I write a research article , it takes me a couple of hours before I can even begin to think creatively .
If I was switching every 10 and half minutes , there ’s just no way I ’d be able to think deeply about what I ’m doing .
This is really bad for innovation .
When you ’re on the treadmill like this , it ’s just not possible to achieve flow .
But many people tout the information revolution as a great spawning ground for creativity — we ’re coming into contact with new ideas , forging new connections , tapping into new networks .
Do you buy any of that ?
You have to put that in perspective .
Let me give you an example .
Eleven years ago I was a researcher at the Boeing company I studied a virtual world that was being deployed so people in the distributed company of Boeing would be able to meet others share expertise .
It was basically like Second Life .
We deployed this and we could not get anyone to use it .
They went there out of curiosity and then they left and never came back .
Eleven years later with Second Life , with all due respect , we ’re seeing exactly the same thing .
People come , they ’re curious and then they do n’t come back .
Certainly , technology is giving us access to a lot more different people , but how many of these end up being quality relationships ?
That ’s the question we really have to ask .
advertisement
You ’re the expert — how do you protect productive time ?
I stay home .
I do have to go into the university on some days but I try to schedule appointments so that I can stay home as much as I can , because that ’s the only way I ’m not going to be interrupted .
What advice do you give to people who feel like they ca n’t keep up ?
Limit your web usage .
Be disciplined .
I am the most productive if I limit web usage to twice per day , once in the morning and once at night .
To be more realistic , it ’s usually like four times a day that I check e-mail .
If I do that , I can be really productive .
Be honest : have you been checking e-mail during this conversation ?
I have to confess , I did once or twice .
Do We Actually Want To Be Conned ?
All Too Often : Yes ( September 3 , 2008 )
Do we actually want to be conned ?
All too often , the answer is a resounding " yes . "
Our society places a premium on " street smarts " and being unconnable , but in reality we all fall prey to cons of one sort or another .
For instance : how many times would you drive downtown or to the park or Wal - Mart if a taxi- meter banged a gong and flashed a large LED sign of the cost of gasoline and maintenance every tenth of a mile ?
After the meter hit $ 5 , you would n't feel the same about " running errands , " believe me .
Not wanting the true costs of driving tallied is wanting to be conned .
We want to be conned into the " affordability " of driving ; that last tank of gasoline was " only " $ 50 and lasted quite a while -- or so we want to believe .
And when the charity or the church fund drive approaches you for a donation , if you trust in your church then you willingly suspend your distrust of organizations and willingly believe your money will be well - spent , because if you did n't , then you would not donate .
In a similar fashion , we want to believe that buying real estate with a 30 - year mortgage is a " cheap " " affordable " way to own a house -- even though the reality is we end up paying three or four times more than the house is worth .
Please scroll down and read Mark R'.s comments on the high cost of financing .
If every mortgage statement came with 4 - inch high bold letters stating how much was paid for financing and how little was paid on principle , it would certainly modify our belief in the " affordability " of 30 - year mortgages .
( Such long - term loans are a rarity in many countries , for good reason -- they 're a complete rip - off . )
We also want to be conned that the ideological purity of a candidate means he / she is really going to be honest and trustworthy .
Heh .
This is called " preaching to the choir " or " playing to the base . "
Yesirree Bob , I share your rock - solid belief in the sanctity of ( insert pet ideological cause / belief ) and so vote for me .
Hey , it works , because we want to be conned .
The reality that all politicians have fluid values and will vote as compromise , party politics , pork , wheeling and dealing , lobbying , cash contributions and PR dictate .
Ideological " purity " and beliefs are what 's sold to suckers round election - time .
In some cases , trust and being conned are essentially identical .
If you attended a do - nothing staff meeting or three at your favorite charity and saw how little was actually accomplished with your money , then it would certainly erode your trust and your willingness to donate .
But without that trust , then whatever good the organization did accomplish with your money would go undone , too .
Let 's turn to American master Herman Melville and his underappreciated masterpiece The Confidence - Man for further illumination on the nature of confidence and the con .
I wrote this review awhile back but find the book perfectly suited to the topic of confidence , trust and the slipperiness of the con .
Why read a book from 1857 which flopped so badly as commercial literature that Melville stopped writing and ended his career as a customs official ?
Because this book masterfully explores the entire nature of trust , confidence and cons .
Though the setting is a riverboat on the Mississippi River just before the U.S. exploded into Civil War , its insights cross cultural boundaries .
This is not an easy book to read for several reasons .
First , it is undoubtedly one of the first " post - modern " novels which breaks from traditional narrative storytelling .
( Another example : Dostoevsky 's Notes From the Underground . )
The Confidence - Man is a collection of 45 conversations between various people on the riverboat -- beggars , absurdly dressed frontiersmen , sickly misers , shysters , patent medicine hucksters , veterans ( of the Mexican - American War ) and the " hero " in the latter part of the book , the Cosmopolitan .
In typical Melville fashion , you also get asides -- directly to the reader , in several cases , as if Melville felt the need to address issues of fiction outside the actual form of his novel .
The lack of structure , action and conclusion make this a post - modern type book , but if you read each conversation as a separate story , then it starts to make more sense .
For what ties the book together is not a story but a theme : the nature of trust and confidence .
In a very sly way , Melville shows how a variety of cons are worked , as the absolutely distrustful are slowly but surely convinced to do exactly what they vowed not to do : buy the " herbal " patent medicine , buy shares in a bogus stock venture , or donate cash to a suspect " charity . "
In other chapters , it seems like the con artist is either stopped in his tracks or is conned himself .
Since the book is mostly conversations , we are left to our own conclusions ; there is no authorial voice wrapping up each chapter with a neatly stated ending .
This elliptical structure conveys the ambiguous nature of trust ; we do n't want to be taken , but confidence is also necessary for any business to be transacted .
To trust no one is to be entirely isolated .
Melville also raises the question : is it always a bad thing to be conned ?
The sickly man seems to be improved by his purchase of the worthless herbal remedy , and the donor conned out of his cash for the bogus charity also seems to feel better about himself and life .
The ornery frontiersman who 's been conned by lazy helpers softens up enough to trust the smooth - talking employment agency owner .
Is that a terrible thing , to trust despite a history of being burned ?
The ambuiguous nature of the bonds of trust is also explored .
We think the Cosmopolitan is a con-man , but when he convinces a fellow passenger to part with a heavy sum , he returns it , just to prove a point .
Is that a continuance of the con , or is he actually trustworthy ?
The book is also an exploration of a peculiarly American task : sorting out who to trust in a multicultural non-traditional society of highly diverse and highly mobile citizens .
In a traditional society , things operate in rote ways ; young people follow in their parents ' traditional roles , money is made and lent according to unchanging standards , and faith / tradition guides transactions such as marriage and business along well - worn pathways .
But in America , none of this structure is available .
Even in Melville 's day , America was a polyglot culture on the move ; you had to decide who to trust based on their dress , manner and speech / pitch .
The con , of course , works on precisely this necessity to rely on one 's senses and rationality rather than a traditional network of trusted people and methods .
So the con man dresses well and has a good story , and an answer for every doubt .
The second reason why Melville is hard to read is his long , leisurely , clause upon clause sentences .
But the book is also peppered with his sly humor , which sneaks up on you ... well , just like a good con .
Like it or not , sometimes it feels good to be conned .
Readers ' comments : Adam S. Kudos to your notes on GDP and other fake government numbers .
Along these lines , I would like to draw your attention , and the attention of your readers , if they are not already aware , to the important work being done by Chris Martenson .
The presentation that he has specifically on this subject is :
fuzzy numbers
However , there is much more substantial material at his website , worth pondering and chewing on .
In its entirety , it can be found here :
crash course Mark R. I just read your commentary about lowering the cost structure of the U.S. Economy .
The healthcare comments reminded me of how we are all being forced to pay exorbitant costs to financiers , not only of healthcare , but of everything in our world .
The cost structure of healthcare is out of proportion to other things because of the way we pay for it .
We have all been convinced ( read : scared into believing ) that the only way to pay for healthcare is through healthcare insurance , and similarly we are all convinced that the way to finance our lives is through debt .
( And by " debt " I mean not only credit cards and mortgages , but the very debt money that is at the root of our system . )
There is no way around the fact that we create an inflated " value " of everything by financing our way through life .
We pay for our healthcare by buying healthcare insurance from cradle - to - grave so that we pay a relatively small amount , forever .
That is a debt burden .
Who makes the big money in this system as currently structured ?
The insurance carriers do .
They are the financiers of our healthcare system .
All costs are inflated along the way .
I believe that healthcare insurance is a good thing in general , but honestly , how much are we paying our VERY profitable healthcare insurers ?
Why is n't healthcare insurance supported in our society as a non-profit institution ?
( Notice the distinction from government sponsored universal healthcare . )
We all pay a little , so that those in need are n't straddled with a huge debt for healthcare bills .
Why should an insurance company reap humongous profits to be the financier , while they use our money ( called premiums ) in the first place ?
How do we pay for real estate ?
Through mortgages , which create an inflated " value " of the underlying property since we can pay over time with money we do n't currently have .
Who makes profit to the tune of multiples of the underlying asset ?
The bank who issued the mortgage does .
Are people willing to pay about three times for their home if they can get it now and pay over the course of thirty years ?
Apparently yes .
Does it drive the cost of real estate up and up ?
Yes .
Is there an end to that run up ?
We are living through it now .
I do n't see all debt as bad , but perpetual debt growth ( read : growth in the quantity of money in our system ) is reaching a dangerous point to where our monetary system seems about to collapse .
Everything costs too much money !
And , the sick twist is that real things ( like the bookstore you mentioned whose rent became too high ) fail and disappear , in order to support a system of fake money .
As I see it , the benefit that we get by operating in a fiat money world ( where central banks and fractional reserve banking allows financiers to create money out of thin air ) is that we get a rapidly expanding economy , so that in the span of a human lifetime , we see " progress . "
The drawbacks are that we have the unnatural pressures of paying ever increasing costs for everything , money expands based on the bubble - du - jour created by a central bank , and we get to experience a painful collapse of the monetary system .
It would be really interesting to see you address the true cost of financing when discussing cost structure in the U.S.
Thanks for your excellent blog .
And , btw , I am a doctor which is why I was interested in the healthcare part of your recent musing .
New Book Notes :
My new " little book of big ideas , " Weblogs & New Media : Marketing in Crisis is now available on amazon.com for $ 10.99 .
Here is a review of the book : Charles Hugh Smith 's " Weblogs & New Media : Marketing in Crisis " is one of the most important business analyses I have ever read .
It is the first to squarely face converging global crises from a business perspective : peak oil , climate change , resource depletion , and the junction of key social cycles will radically alter the business landscape in coming decades .
As an entrepreneur I have been retooling my own business to meet these head on , but have felt hamstrung by marketing 's insistence upon positivity even to absurdity and denial .
" Weblogs & New Media " helped immensely by providing the conceptual framework I needed to move forward .
Within this framework I can begin formulating strategy appropriate for the new global zeitgeist -- namely , trust as the new currency du jour .
Moreover , Smith offers insights for building this trust via digital resources that business currently misunderstands and misuses , a criticism that will be familiar to Seth Godin fans but which has implications far beyond traditional marketing goals .
" Weblogs & New Media " is essential reading for any entrepreneur who refuses to drink the business media kool - aid , and who wishes his or her business to remain viable even in times of crisis .
An excerpt from Claire 's Great Adventure :
By the time she reached the deck and pulled herself aboard , Claire was breathing hard and sweating from the exertion .
A single bulb in a steel fixture lit the forward deck ; Crouching down in the shadows , she waited impatiently for Camden , scanning the quiet ship .
There was no sign of life ; just a clutter of gray bollards , booms and hatches , and a steel staircase up to the bridge with more rust than gray paint .
An oval - shaped steel door led into the superstructure , and this door was ajar .
With one last " oof " of effort , Camden pulled herself onto the steel deck and kneeled down by Claire to catch her breath .
" This is spooky , " she whispered heavily , peering into the weird shadows cast by the sole lightbulb , and Claire nodded .
Warily standing up , Claire waved to Aunt May , who now seemed awfully small in the dimly lit expanse of the dock beyond the security fence .
A movement far to the right caught her eye , but when she turned to the circles of light beyond the dock she saw neither man nor beast .
Aunt May must have seen her , for the phone rang hollowly just inside the ajar bulkhead door .
Forcing herself forward to the door , Claire was greatly relieved to find Camden crouching just behind her .
Pushing the door open with one prolonged squeak , the two girls entered a hallway illuminated by one bulb in a dangling wall fixture and crept into a barren office where the third and final ring had sounded .
The mobile phone lay on a table , and without thinking Claire opened it and said , " Aunt May ? "
A male voice grunted and said , " Wei ? "
At that instant a dog began barking somewhere on the dock , for the sounds of someone clambering noisily up the ladder was suddenly audible .
A haphazard cacophony of voices came from the phone , and she heard Aunt May shriek , " Get off the ship ! "
Dropping the phone onto the table , Claire rushed to the hallway door and peeked out .
To her horror , an Asian man lofted himself onto the deck in one easy , muscular move , followed by several other wiry Asian men .
One yelled , perhaps to quiet the barking dog , and Claire withdrew in a panic unlike any she 'd ever felt .
" Come on ! " she whispered frantically to Camden , and then hurried down the passageway past a half - dozen wooden doors .
Hesitating briefly , she turned left and came to a dark opening into the bowels of the ship ; illuminated by a single bulb somewhere far below , she could see the black outlines of a ladder descending into the depths and little else .
" This guy is THE leading visionary on reality .
He routinely discusses things which no one else has talked about , yet , turn out to be quite relevant months later . "

The officials of number one search engine Google announced that the company would pay $ 10 million for any new idea that can help the world .
On Wednesday CNN reported that Google 's project , entitled Project 10^100 ( ten to the hundredth ) represents a part of the company 's 10th anniversary .
According to the Menlo Park , Calif. , Internet company , up to five ideas would be chosen by the public and a panel of judges and the winners would be announced in February .
In its press release the company said : " These ideas can be big or small , technology - driven or brilliantly simple - but they need to have impact .
We know there are countless brilliant ideas that need funding and support to come to fruition . "
It is worth mentioning that people are free to submit ideas in any of the 25 languages .
Ideas should be submitted at http://www.project10tothe100.com/index.html by October 20 .
Those who are willing to take part in the competition must answer six questions and describe their idea .
The company 's employees and an advisory board will analyze the submissions and on January 27th chose 100 ideas .
Between January 27th and February 2nd the public will vote for the 20 semifinalists .
An advisory board will then analyze them and pick up to five best ideas .
Ideas can be submitted to several categories , including community , opportunity , energy , environment , health , education and shelter .
In case an idea does n't fit in those categories , there 's " Everything else " - a category where those ideas can be submitted .

Integrity was founded on the idea of being better .
From our people to our post frame buildings and everything in between .
Our R&D team is unique to our industry and we 're proud to be at the forefront of the innovation that goes into an Integrity Post Structure .
We could design farm barns , hay sheds , and aircraft hangars , the same way they have been built for 50 years .
But why would we ?
We were n't satisfied with only being able to offer wooden posts in the ground .
Wood in the ground rots and it ’s expensive to replace .
Integrity was the first Canadian Post Frame construction company to offer the Concrete Perma - Column Foundation System .
We are also the only company that casts our posts in Canada and we offer a lifetime warranty because they simply wo n't rot .
No matter if we are constructing an airplane hangar in BC , assembling farm shops in Alberta , building barns in Saskatchewan , or providing shed packages in Manitoba , our designs withstand brutal Canadian winters .
Harsh weather events led us to create the Integrity Storm Bracket to increase connection strength up to 10X previous strength and reduce total building deflection by up to 350 % — a stronger building able to withstand high winds .
Better Buildings By Design .
That 's the Integrity Way .
EMPE , Ariz . - Facing a threat that his homosexuality would be exposed by Christian conservatives at a city council meeting , Mayor Neil Giuliano did what he thought was nobody 's business :
He held a press conference and declared , '' I happen to be gay . ''
The reaction of Arizona 's senior senator , John McCain , was swift and angry .
'' John was the first to tell the religious right , ' This does n't make a damned bit of difference , ''' Giuliano said , remembering how McCain went out of his way to call him a good mayor and a great friend .
'' Politically in Arizona , McCain should have done just the opposite .
Instead , he came right to my defense .
He 's a loyal friend . ''
GOP presidential candidate John McCain has a pattern of putting his heart ahead of his head and even his political judgment .
Peel off the pretense of a cocky fighter pilot and a prickly politician , those who know him well say , and what really shapes John McCain is his loyalty to family and friends and a fierce sense of duty to defend underdogs under attack .
Today McCain will be in Boston seeking support in Tuesday 's GOP primary in Massachusetts .
He has been in hot water this week for his highly personal lashing of Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell , who he said he believes have dishonored him with their negative attacks .
McCain was forced to apologize after calling the two Christian conservative leaders '' forces of evil , '' and then he faced new questions about his temperament to be president .
' ' I do n't think it should be a source of worry , '' McCain said during a candidates debate Thursday night , '' but anything is fair game , as I 've found out during this campaign . ''
To admirers like Giuliano , McCain 's sensitivity , generosity , and loyalty are the hallmarks of his character .
To targets of his outrage , McCain 's thin skin is his fatal flaw .
'' His greatest strength is also his greatest weakness , '' said Mike Hellon of Tucson , a state GOP leader who has known McCain for two decades .
'' John is impatient with fools .
Particularly if people are acting improperly or in a self - serving fashion , he can be very difficult .
He puts loyalty first , even when it is not in his best interest . ''
Lisa Graham Keegan , Arizona 's superintendent of public instruction , was close to McCain until she publicly called for the resignation of Governor Fife Symington after he was indicted for bank fraud in 1996 .
McCain , who stood by his friend Symington , considered Keegan disloyal , told her so in no uncertain terms , and shut her out of his political circle .
'' He was right : I was disloyal , and I meant to be , '' said Keegan , who is so sure McCain would be a good president that she recently arranged a meeting in which both apologized for the falling out .
Now , Keegan frequently travels with McCain 's campaign and advises him on education policy .
'' He 's never going to win the Miss Congeniality award or take you to lunch , but he is always looking to do the right thing . '' she said .
McCain had values drilled into him by a father and grandfather who were decorated Navy admirals and adhered to a rigid military code of honor , duty , and country .
He 's a proud graduate of the Naval Academy ( though , McCain ruefully notes , he was a hell - raiser who barely squeaked through ) .
And he had a profound lesson in allies and enemies as a tortured prisoner of war in Vietnam for 51/2 years .
Bruce Merrill , the pollster in McCain 's first congressional campaign in 1982 , said he respects and admires the senator 's compelling history .
But like others who have been in combat with McCain , Merrill has been awed by his ambition and alienated by his self - righteous '' in your face , do it my way or you 'll pay a hell of a penalty ' ' style .
'' He is a very forceful , dynamic person , and in 30 years of political consulting , I have never seen a candidate as driven as John McCain , '' said Merrill , a professor at Arizona State University in Tempe .
'' He is a crusader , and the mythology that has built up here - that he divides the world into his camp or the enemy camp - is consistent with a crusade . ''
McCain saw enemies challenging all his relationships - friends , family , fellow veterans - during the bitter , losing primary fight last month in South Carolina .
There was Texas Governor George W. Bush , failing to renounce a supporter who accused McCain of disloyalty to veterans .
There was Robertson , in a taped telephone message , calling McCain 's friend , the former New Hampshire Senator Warren Rudman , ''a vicious bigot . ''
And there were strident voices all over the airwaves , spreading ugly stories about his wife and children .
Barreling down a South Carolina highway on the campaign bus , aides showed McCain a flier filled with personal smears that had been circulated at an event earlier in the day .
McCain snatched the leaflet before his wife , Cindy , could read it .
'' Why upset her unnecessarily ? ''
McCain snapped .
'' Like most wives , she does n't want to see those things said about her husband . ''
The McCains were deeply and personally offended by Bush 's visit to Bob Jones University , which bans interracial dating , and by rumors about their '' black child . ''
On a relief mission to Bangladesh in 1991 , Cindy McCain claimed an orphan who was so severely disfigured by a cleft lip and palate that she was unable to eat .
She brought 2 - month - old Bridget home to Phoenix , where the McCains adopted the baby and nursed her through a dozen operations .
'' What people miss about John is that behind the tough , fighter facade is a deeply sensitive person , and things really hurt him , '' said Everett Alvarez Jr. , who was a fellow POW in Vietnam .
Uncomfortable war hero
Orson Swindle , McCain 's neighbor in the Hanoi Hilton , blinked back tears when he recalled McCain 's reaction to winning the New Hampshire primary last month .
'' Amid all the electricity that night , John got incredibly solemn , '' Swindle said .
'' He came over and looked me straight in the eye , as if to say , `My God , look how far we have come and what we have done . ''
McCain has never been comfortable as a war hero , honored and greeted with adulation , Swindle said , when so many other Vietnam combat veterans came home to no warm welcome at all .
'' That wound is still with a lot of us , '' said Swindle , adding that it probably fuels McCain 's strong sense of injustice .
But McCain 's loyalties have at times blurred his political judgment .
At the request of Charles H. Keating Jr. , a Phoenix developer and political benefactor , McCain met in 1987 with federal bank regulators who were closing in on Keating 's shaky Lincoln Savings & Loan Association .
After an investigation of McCain and four other senators , the Senate Ethics Committee reprimanded McCain , though concluded he did not act improperly .
Still , it appeared McCain had catered to the kind of special interest he now decries .
Another strong and unlikely relationship was at work in 1992 , when McCain supported a Senate bill allowing fetal - tissue research .
His good friend and Democratic mentor , Representative Morris K. Udall , was suffering from Parkinson 's disease , and Udall 's family convinced McCain fetal tissue showed some promise as a cure .
Antiabortion activists still are attacking McCain for his vote .
McCain and Jim Kolbe ran for the US House from separate Arizona districts in 1982 , but only McCain won .
Two years later , when Kolbe ran again , McCain ignored the political convention that you do n't campaign against an incumbent and went door - to - door for his friend Kolbe until he was too exhausted to stand up straight .
Kolbe won .
Kolbe called McCain first as he prepared in 1996 to disclose his homosexuality .
'' Before I got two words out , John said , ` I know what this is about , and it does n't matter , ''' Kolbe said .
'' He was n't shocked or offended . ''
McCain stands out as having one of the most loyal and long - serving staffs on Capitol Hill .
Aides say he does n't micromanage , but he does solicit their views , inquire about their children , pummel them with smart - aleck insults , and work them to the bone , the same way the 63 - year - old McCain works himself .
On the day of the South Carolina primary , McCain telephoned Deb Gullett , a longtime aide and his Arizona campaign manager , to tell her he was losing that hard - fought contest .
'' He called to ask me how I was doing , to make sure we were fine , and I just wanted to cry , '' Gullett said .
'' He also said , ` By the way , get your dead asses back to work , ' and that is a direct quote . ''
Mark Salter , McCain 's chief of staff , said his boss is n't cozy with his Senate colleagues because he gores their sacred cows and '' wo n't treat them like movie stars , with exaggerated courtesy . ''
Salter , who has worked for McCain for 11 years and coauthored his best - selling biography , '' Faith of My Fathers , '' attributed reports of the senator 's hot temper to '' legend - padding . ''
Family first
Senator John Kerry says he and McCain forged a bond as Vietnam veterans and he respects him as a loyal friend .
'' I enjoy his company , John 's a funny guy , '' the Massachusetts Democrat said .
'' Most of the bad things you hear come from people he 's put on the spot . ''
Kolbe said McCain got better at controlling his temper in the wake of three unnerving and very personal events .
One was the Keating scandal , which he saw as an assault on his honor .
A second was the discovery that his wife had been addicted to prescription painkillers from 1989 to 1992 and had stolen drugs from her family 's charitable foundation .
A third was a 1993 diagnosis of malignant melanoma , the most lethal type of skin cancer .
McCain had the cancerous mole removed from his shoulder , and no melanoma has recurred , according to his medical records .
'' Those things were pretty scary for him , and he really refocused his life and realized what a blessing his family was to him , '' Kolbe said .
McCain blames himself for the breakup of his first marriage .
McCain wanted a fuller , faster life than he found back home with his first wife .
Carol Shepp McCain , who lives in the Washington area , has spoken kindly of her former husband , says she supports his candidacy , and attributes their divorce to '' John turning 40 and wanting to be 25 again . ''
McCain did what he believed was honorable :
He provided generously for Carol , who had been seriously injured in a car accident during his captivity , and their three children , including two adopted sons from her previous marriage .
'' If you can ever have an amicable divorce , this one was , '' said George '' Bud ' ' Day , a lawyer and POW friend who drew up the papers in 1980 .
A month after the divorce , McCain married Cindy Hensley , 24 , an heiress to a Phoenix beer - distribution fortune , and part of a politically well - connected family .
They have four school - aged children who McCain dotes on and disciplines in a way his own father never did .
The grown children from his first marriage - Doug , Andy , and Sydney Ann - are campaigning for McCain , and Andy works for the Hensley family 's company in Phoenix .
McCain sent leatherbound copies of his biography to Doug 's children , autographing them '' The Old Geezer . ''
'' The kindergarten teacher admonished my daughter to stop calling her grandfather that , '' said Doug , a former Navy flier who is now a commercial airline pilot in Virginia Beach , Va . '' She said , `but that 's what he likes to be called . '''
For a geezer , McCain is as energized as a Boy Scout leader around his children , camping , hiking , fishing , swimming , and grilling the food at their weekend cabin near Sedona , Ariz .
On the campaign bus , the youngsters are either fighting McCain for the last potato chip in the bag or giving him a hard time .
'' Pork - barrel spender ! ''
Jimmy McCain , 11 , yells at Jack , his 13 - year - old brother .
Jimmy 's not sure what the expression means , but it sounds funny and besides , he 's heard his candidate - father bellow it hundreds of times .
Betsy Cuming , an old friend from Yuma , said the family lives in Phoenix , not Washington , because McCain thinks the children of elected officials get coddled , spoiled , and too often uprooted .
Sharon Harper , the McCain 's neighbor in Phoenix , said McCain wants to be president for a very personal reason :
To restore honor to the military before all or some of his children are old enough to serve .
McCain gets emotional at the mention of military families needing food stamps or veterans lacking health care .
The outrage comes from inside : McCain 's severe war injuries prevent him from combing his hair , typing on a keyboard , or tying his shoes .
Friends marvel at McCain 's encyclopedic knowledge of sports .
He 's an avid fan - Ted Williams is his hero - but he can't raise his arm above his shoulder to throw a baseball .
After Vietnam , McCain had Ann Lawrence , a physical therapist , help him regain flexibility in his leg , which had been frozen in an extended position by a shattered knee .
It was the only way he could hope to resume his career as a Navy flier , but Lawrence said the treatment , taken twice a week for six months , was excruciatingly painful .
'' He endured it , he would n't settle for less , '' said Lawrence , who rejoiced with McCain when he passed the Navy physical .
'' I have never seen such toughness and resolve . ''
McCain 's determination was evident to Lawrence in another way .
During the therapy , he insisted his '' physical terrorist ' ' was the perfect match for one of his POW buddies , William Lawrence .
She resisted , McCain persisted , and the Lawrences were married months after McCain forced them to meet at his home over dinner .
McCain says his campaign is '' a noble mission , '' and those close to him believe he has brought to it the same character traits - toughness , endurance , even risk - taking - that Ann Lawrence observed many years ago .
'' He has a zest for life that sometimes can drive the rest of us nuts , '' said Cindy McCain , who reluctantly signed onto her husband 's presidential express last fall , not really expecting it to become this runaway train .
'' When we 're exhausted , John says , ` There 's more to the day - let 's go ! '''
Late last month , Senator John McCain went up with a new television ad , titled “ Pump . ”
The ad begins no place in particular with a gasoline pump , circa 1965 .
“ Gas prices — four dollars , five dollars , ” a female narrator intones , as the numbers on the pump ’s front panel spin .
“ No end in sight , because some in Washington are still saying no to drilling in America , no to independence from foreign oil .
Illustration by Tom Bachtell
“ Who can you thank for rising prices at the pump ? ” the narrator asks .
She leaves the question hanging , while a recording from a recent political rally grows louder and louder .
“ Obama ! Obama ! ” the crowd screams .
How important is it for candidates to tell the truth ?
Throughout his long career in politics , McCain , who called his PAC Straight Talk America , has presented frankness as his fundamental virtue .
If his positions — on campaign finance , on immigration reform , on the Bush tax cuts — were unpopular with either the White House or the Republican Party faithful , that just showed that he was willing to tackle the tough issues .
When his campaign very nearly collapsed and then revived , in December , McCain attributed his rally not to the fact that voters liked what he was saying but to the fact that they did n’t .
“ I ’ve been telling people the truth , whether I thought that ’s what they wanted or not , ” he said .
After his crucial victory in New Hampshire , in January , he again credited his candor : “ I went to the people of New Hampshire to tell them the truth .
Sometimes I told them what they wanted to know , sometimes I told them what they did n’t want to know . ”
The past few weeks have seen a change in McCain .
He has hired new advisers , and with them he seems to have worked out a new approach .
He is no longer telling the sorts of hard truths that people would prefer not to confront , or even half - truths that they might find vaguely discomfiting .
Instead , he ’s opted out of truth altogether .
“ Well , that certainly did n’t take long , ” the Times observed .
The sharp increase in gasoline prices — the national average for a gallon of regular hit a record high , of $ 4.11 , on July 7th — has shown up in several recent voter polls as a top concern .
In a CNN / Opinion Research survey released last month , seventy - seven per cent of respondents said that gas prices would be “ extremely ” or “ very ” important in their choice for President .
An NBC / Wall Street Journal poll taken in mid-July put energy and gasoline prices just below “ job creation and economic growth ” but above the war as a priority for the government to address .
Polls also show that a majority of Americans believe that more drilling for oil in the United States would alleviate the problem .
The CNN / Opinion Research survey found that seventy - three per cent of Americans back increased offshore drilling — although President Bush recently lifted an executive moratorium on drilling in most coastal waters , a congressionally imposed moratorium remains in place — while a recent Los Angeles Times / Bloomberg survey showed sixty - nine per cent in favor of allowing drilling on currently protected federal lands .
( Twelve per cent supported such a move even if it caused damage to “ environmentally important areas . ” )
Of course , the results of these or any other public - opinion surveys do not alter the underlying reality .
The Department of Energy estimates that there are eighteen billion barrels of technically recoverable oil in offshore areas of the continental United States that are now closed to drilling .
This sounds like a lot , until you consider that oil is a globally traded commodity and that , at current rates of consumption , eighteen billion barrels would satisfy less than seven months of global demand .
A D.O.E. report issued last year predicted that it would take two decades for drilling in restricted areas to have a noticeable effect on domestic production , and that , even then , “ because oil prices are determined on the international market , ” the impact on fuel costs would be “ insignificant . ”
Just a few months ago , McCain himself noted that offshore resources “ would take years to develop . ”
As the oilman turned wind farmer T. Boone Pickens has observed , “ This is one emergency we ca n’t drill our way out of . ”
If the hard truth is that the federal government can’t do much to lower gas prices , the really hard truth is that it should n’t try to .
With just five per cent of the world ’s population , America accounts for twenty - five per cent of its oil use .
This disproportionate consumption is one of the main reasons that the United States — until this year , when China overtook it — was the world ’s largest emitter of greenhouse gases .
( Every barrel of oil burned adds roughly a thousand pounds of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere . )
No matter how many warnings about the consequences were issued — by NASA , by the United Nations , by Al Gore , by the Pope — Americans seemed unfazed .
Even as the Arctic ice cap visibly melted away , they bought bigger and bigger cars and drove them more and more miles .
The impact of rising fuel prices , by contrast , has been swift and appreciable .
According to the latest figures from the Federal Highway Administration , during the first five months of this year Americans drove thirty billion fewer miles than they did during the same period last year .
This marks the first time in a generation that vehicle miles in this country have edged downward .
All told , undriven trips since the start of 2008 amount to some thirty billion pounds of unreleased CO2 .
Clearly , the only way to change America ’s consumption habits is by making those habits more expensive .
McCain , in his straight - talking days , acknowledged as much .
In 2003 , he broke with the Bush Administration and co-introduced legislation to reduce carbon emissions , by , in effect , imposing a price on them .
That same year , over strong White House opposition , he brought the bill to the Senate floor .
( It was defeated , by a vote of fifty - five to forty - three . )
In an interview with this magazine , he said that he regarded the opposition to his proposal , largely from members of his own party , as a scandal .
“ I think it ’s a dramatic example of the influence of special interests here in the Congress , ” he said .
“ It ’s a combination of the utilities and the coal companies and automobile manufacturers — an unholy alliance of special interests that have made it a top priority to prevent any action being taken . ”
He went on to say that he was n’t sure the American political system was up to dealing with the challenge of climate change .
“ How much damage will have been done before we act ? ” he asked .
Recent history suggests that Presidential campaigns do n’t reward integrity ; the candidate who refuses to compromise his principles is unlikely to have a chance to act on them .
Still , McCain ’s slide is saddening .
That he has sunk to the level of “ Pump ” a full month before Labor Day really does n’t leave him — or the race — far to go . ♦
I found Ender 's Game when I was 13 , and I loved it .
I must 've read it a dozen times .
Based on that love , I snapped up every new Orson Scott Card book as soon as it appeared in my local book store , and devoured them .
Even then , I recognized that some of them were just OK , but I loved his writing style–enough so that I even bought a book he wrote about how to write well .
I went to Philcon ' 92 just because he was going to be there , and had him sign a whole bunch of my books .
I stopped reading him when he started injecting so much Mormonism into his books that even the teenaged version of me recognized it .
Now it 's two decades later , and Orson Scott Card has written a strongly anti-gay screed that goes so far as to propose active rebellion to ensure that marriage is legally defined to his liking .
Like many others who have read his diatribe , I am utterly repulsed by his words , to the point that they have drastically altered my perception of him as a person , and yes , to some extent , as an author .
So now what do I do with the copies of Card 's books :
Should I get rid of them ?
Should I encourage my kids to read them ?
Essentially , does the fact that I find his opinions utterly repugnant invalidate his work somehow ?
( We can debate endlessly whether Ender 's Game is really a good book , or if it's an apologia for Hitler , or whatever .
I liked it when I was a teenager , and have n't read it since ; I do n't know if I would like it now . )
This is n't an isolated case .
There are lots of people who have done good work who have turned out to be reprehensible people of one kind or a another :
In 1987 , Sean Connery told Barbara Walters that sometimes it was OK for a man to slap a woman .
Roald Dahl made quite a few seriously anti-Semitic remarks , including saying " even a stinker like Hitler did n’t just pick on them for no reason . "
O.J. Simpson was in the Naked Gun movies , then " allegedly " became a murderer , and , you may have heard , got away with it .
Mel Gibson showed himself to be a homophobe and anti-Semite , not to mention a drunk driver .
Henry Ford was given a medal by the Nazis , four months after the Anschluss .
Ford eagerly accepted it , as he was a rabid anti-Semite .
Elia Kazan , the brilliant director of such films as On the Waterfront , named names to the House Un- American Activities Committee .
There are more , of course , but I think I 've made my point .
I 've wrestled with this question before ; in fact , I do so every time I watch a Sean Connery movie .
He 's just such a great actor that it's not that hard to temporarily forget his misogynist streak .
By the same token , though , I 've found I can't watch the Naked Gun movies at all , not that that 's a huge loss .
Try as I might , I can't look at O.J. Simpson and see anything but a murderer who got away with it .
I do n't think I 'd be able to even if he were the best actor who ever lived .
There 's another consideration here :
It is only relatively recently that the private doings and opinions of pretty much everybody could be found so readily .
People who read Charlie and the Chocolate Factory when it first came out were most likely unaware of its author 's anti-Semitism .
And it 's doubtful that many people who bought Fords over the years knew of the company 's founder 's Nazi sympathies .
It could easily said that we 're better off not knowing , because then there 's no moral decision to make .
But in this age of constant information , where every writer has a blog and every cell phone has a camera , I do n't think anyone , and especially anyone reading this article , can count on ignorance saving them .
What we need , then , is a new unit of measurement .
We need a way to gauge the quality of a person 's work against whatever repugnant thing (s ) they 've done .
I think Sean Connery is the perfect choice for deriving the name , as he is the least repugnant of the people I 've mentioned .
I therefore propose using a system based on his last name , so a " kiloconnery " " hectoconnery " would refer to a person whom you consider 100 times as repugnant as Sean Connery , a " decaconnery " would be someone who is 10 times as repugnant , and so forth .
If you have a better idea for a unit of measurement , please by all means mention it in a comment .
I still have to figure out what I should or should n't tell my kids about the authors of the books they read , if the author is more than a couple of conneries .
If they read Ender 's Game , should I tell them about Card 's appalling personal opinions ?
If I do , should I tell them before they read it , or afterwards so they can read it with the same blissful ignorance I had when I read it ?
Of course , Card has plenty of time to say more appalling things , or even ( though it would surprise me if he did so ) potentially apologize and make amends for the appalling things he 's said so far , before my kids will be old enough for his books , so I guess it may end up as a game - time decision .
Plus , there 's still talk about a movie based on the book , so I 'll have to decide about that , too .
Turkey risks a collapse of its secular political system akin to that of the Soviet Union if it bows to international pressure to recognise the 1915 - 22 Armenian genocide , the head of Armenia 's state memorial to the event has told the Guardian .
Hayk Demoyan said Ankara could not acknowledge the systematic killing of up to 1.5 million Armenians by Ottoman troops during the first world war because it would lead to a wholesale re-writing of history and undermine the ideological basis of the Turkish state .
In remarks that will cast a shadow over attempts to forge a new Turkish - Armenian rapprochement , he said those implicated included Mustafa Kemal Atatürk , founder of modern Turkey and a figure Turks are taught to revere .
Historical documents proved Atatürk committed " war crimes " against Armenians and other groups in his drive to create an ethnically homogeneous Turkish state , Demoyan insisted .
" Fear of rewriting history is the main fear of modern Turkey , " said Demoyan , director of The Armenian Genocide Museum - Institute in Yerevan , Armenia 's capital .
" It is a fear of facing historical reality and causing a total collapse of the ideological axis that modern republican Turkey was formed around .
Turks get panicked when you compare Atatürk 's legacy to Lenin .
Atatürk was sentenced to death in absentia by a military judge to punish war crimes during the first world war .
There are documents from non-Armenian sources listing him as a war criminal . "
Demoyan 's remarks come amid fledgling attempts to re-establish links between two countries which have not had diplomatic relations since 1994 , following a war between Armenia and Azerbaijan , Turkey 's ally .
Tentative efforts towards normalising ties occurred this month when the Turkish president , Abdullah Gül , visited Yerevan to attend a World Cup football match between Turkey and Armenia at the invitation of his Armenian counterpart , Serge Sarkisian .
Unlike most visiting heads of state , Gül did not visit the genocide museum , which displays documentary and photographic exhibits proving , Armenian officials say , that their ethnic brethren were subjected to deliberate genocide .
Turkey vehemently denies this and has jailed Turkish citizens who argued otherwise .
However , rising numbers of Turkish tourists and journalists have visited the museum recently .
" More than 500 Turks have visited this year .
They 've come in unprecedented numbers , " Demoyan said .
" Their reaction is one of shock .
At first there is denial .
Sometimes they ask : ' What is our sin ? ' or ' How can we be responsible for this ? '.
It 's not taught in Turkish schools , so we understand their reaction . "
Turkey claims the Armenian death toll has been exaggerated and that most victims died from starvation or disease .
It also argues that many Turks were killed by Armenian groups .
BEIRUT , Lebanon  Many Arabs were shocked and appalled earlier this month when a prominent Saudi cleric declared that it was permissible to kill the owners of satellite TV stations that broadcast “ immoral ” material .
But the comment , by Sheik Saleh al - Luhaidan , was only the most visible part of a continuing cultural controversy over Arab television .
This summer another Saudi cleric denounced the Arab world ’s most popular television show ever  the dubbed Turkish series “ Noor ”  calling it “ replete with evil , wickedness , moral collapse and a war on the virtues . ”
He also barred Muslims from watching the series , which portrays the lives of moderate Muslims who drink wine with dinner and have premarital sex .
And last week , as if to provide comic relief , a third Saudi cleric said ( in all seriousness ) that children should not be allowed to watch Mickey Mouse , labeling the cartoon character a “ soldier of Satan ” who should be killed .
To some extent , the controversy  which has generated more than a few headlines in the Arab press  reflects a cultural gap between the producers and consumers of television .
While most Arab television dramas are produced in Syria and Egypt , the Arab world ’s biggest TV market , in Saudi Arabia , is by far the most religiously and culturally conservative .
The private contractor business employs thousands
The US government spent $ 85 bn ( £ 45 bn ) between 2003 and 2007 on contractors for services in support of the Iraq war and reconstruction , a report says .
And by the end of 2008 , spending is likely to top $ 100bn , a review by the Congressional Budget Office found .
Supporters say their use is cost - effective but there have also been documented cases of overcharging .
Concern over security contractors also grew following the shooting deaths of 17 Iraqis in September 2007 .
The US is relying on contractors in Iraq at a greater rate than in any other major conflict , the CBO said .
According to CBO estimates , the US currently employs 190,000 contractors in Iraq and neighbouring countries , a ratio of one contractor per member of the US armed forces .
About 20 % are American , 40 % are citizens from the country where they are employed ; and the rest are foreign workers .
They provide services ranging from security , logistics support , construction , petroleum products and food .
Security
The majority of the $ 85bn was spent on contracts within Iraq , with the remainder being awarded for contracts in countries including Kuwait , Bahrain , Qatar and Saudi Arabia .
The use of security contractors has been the focus of particular attention , especially after an incident in September 2007 involving employees of the Blackwater firm which resulted in the deaths of 17 Iraqis .
The US justice department is due to decide soon whether to bring charges , the Associated Press reports .
The company , which said at the time that its staff acted in self - defence , is not expected to be prosecuted .
The CBO report says its analysis shows : the US spent between $ 6bn and $ 19bn on security work in Iraq
about 25,000 to 30,000 people work for security firms in Iraq - of these , 10,000 work directly for the US government and up to 25,000 for the Iraqi government
the costs of a private security contract are similar to those of a US military unit performing a similar job , although during peacetime the private contract would not have to be renewed .
Last December , the US government said it had tightened procedures to give US military commanders a greater role in co-ordinating the movements of private security staff .
But the CBO notes that the legal status of contractor staff , particularly for those who are armed , remains uncertain .
The scale of the private contract business and the sums involved have prompted calls for greater scrutiny .
" I believe we need to create a special committee in the US Senate to exercise oversight over contracting abuses related to reconstruction and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , " said Senator Byron Dorgan recently .
He wants a panel similar to one set up by Senator Harry Truman in 1941 during the build - up to WWII .
" The Truman Committee held 60 hearings on waste , fraud and abuse , " Mr Dorgan said .
" It 's unfathomable to me that we do n't have a bipartisan investigative committee on contracting in Iraq . "

How important is your diet to your overall health ?
A recent study suggests that a healthy diet can add as many as 14 years to your life .
This mindset is largely ignored by most people .
The good news is that even small changes can make a big difference , though .
And kids are one of the most important groups of people who should be making changes !
Parents have a responsibility to not short - change their children 's current and future health .
Here are a few changes that are important to consider .
Almost everyone is capable of making at least one of these lifestyle modifications and if you make all of them , you will likely add years to your life .
How easy would it be to begin to exercise regularly or to be careful about your alcohol consumption or quit smoking or make sure that you are consuming more fruits and vegetables ?
Most of these changes really are not that difficult to accomplish or implement .
The belief by most people is that the changes necessary to improve their health are too difficult .
Here 's the truth : * Eliminating trans fats will cut your heart disease rate by 50 % . *
Those with hypertension will see improvement in their blood pressure simply by eating one small daily serving of dark chocolate . *
Start eating an apple every day and eat a few servings of vegetables .*
Look for ways to incorporate " super foods " in your diet .
Some of the most effective super foods are : beans , blueberries , broccoli , oats , oranges , pumpkin , salmon , soy , spinach , tea , tomatoes , turkey , walnuts , and yogurt .
On the flip - side , here are a few myths that need dispelling .*
The low - fat movement has not been a good one for America .
After the media blitz and introduction of low fat food products , Americans got fatter not thinner . *
Not all fats are bad .
Diets rich in monosaturated fats ( olive oil ) are good for heart disease prevention . *
Eggs are a nutritious , high - protein , whole food full of vitamins and minerals .
They are also relatively low in saturated fat and calories . *
High cholesterol is not as dangerous to your health as trans fats and hydrogenated oils .
Real ideas for implementing healthy changes in your life : * Start cooking .
Salads , soups , stir fries loaded with vegetables .
Just including more fruits and vegetables into your diet will reduce your potential for a heart attack by 50 % . *
Find a good multivitamin that includes Vitamin B and Selenium .
Look for additional calcium and if you live in the north , add 1000 IU 's of vitamin D. *
If you are on the go a lot , you do n't have to sacrifice healthy eating .
It is possible to eat healthy while out , it just takes a little planning and preparation . *
Start small instead of trying a complete diet overhaul .
Perhaps a handful of raisins or walnuts instead of chips or crackers .
If you 're heading out the door , grab an apple instead of something sugar - laden .
Improving your health dramatically is possible with only basic modifications and this is well worth it in the long run .
As parents we certainly owe this to our children !

Slipknot vocalist and frontman Corey Taylor says it 's time for the music industry to stop taking legal action against downloaders .
He feels it is the labels themselves who are to blame for online piracy , since the quality of released music is so bad , no - one wants to buy it .
Slipknot vocalist and frontman Corey Taylor has launched an attack on recording labels , saying that instead of spending their time chasing downloaders , they should use their resources to find bands that produce better music .
Taylor told Kerrang : “ Why would you blame ( people who download music ) ?
Half the f**king albums that are out there are s**t .
I do n’t download , but at the same time , I do n’t buy new music ’ cause it all sucks .
Okay , there ’s a handful of bands that I buy , but other than that , I just buy old s**t because old s**t is good .
Sorry ! ”
Taylor , who recently collected a Kerrang award on behalf of the band saying “ I just showed up for the booze , ” says that it ’s not fair to blame the fall in album sales on file - sharers , and lays the blame squarely on the shoulders of the labels :
“ People wanna blame the decline of album sales on downloading – I think it ’s actually the record companies ’ fault . ”
Of course , lots of people blame the labels for piracy but Taylor believes they are n’t doing their job properly since they promote acts which are n’t up to standard , resulting in people feeling the acts simply are n’t worth the money .
“ I think it ’s the quality of the product .
If record companies would stop giving any f**king mook ( idiot ) on the street with a fringe a record deal or their own record label , maybe you would sell more f**king albums , dips * * ts . ”
A Look at the Myth of Reverse Racism
Posted : Monday , June 24 , 2002 By Tim Wise
Recently , when speaking to a group of high school students , I was asked why I only seemed to be concerned about white racism towards people of color .
We had been discussing racial slurs , and a number of white students wondered why I didnt get as upset about blacks using terms like honky  or cracker ,  as I did about whites using words like nigger . 
Although such an issue may seem trivial in the larger scheme of things especially given the more significant discussions about racism in the educational system that I had hoped to engage in that day the challenge posed by the students was actually an important one .
In fact , it allowed a discussion about the very essence of what racism is and how it operates .
On the one hand , of course , such slurs are quite obviously inappropriate and offensive , and ought not to be used .
That said , I pointed out that even the mention of the words honky  and cracker had elicited laughter ; and not only from the black students in attendance , but also from other whites .
The words are so silly , so juvenile , so utterly pathetic that they hardly qualify as racial slurs at all , let alone slurs on a par with those that have been historically deployed against people of color .
The lack of symmetry between a word like honky and a slur such as nigger was made apparent in an old Saturday Night Live skit , with Chevy Chase and guest , Richard Pryor .
In the skit , Chase and Pryor face one another and trade off racial epithets during a segment of Weekend Update .
Chase calls Pryor a porch monkey .
Pryor responds with honky .
Chase ups the ante with  jungle bunny .
Pryor , unable to counter with a more vicious slur against whites , responds with honky , honky . 
Chase then trumps all previous slurs with nigger ,  to which Pryor responds : dead honky . 
The line elicits laughs all around , but also makes clear , at least implicitly that when it comes to racial antilocution , people of color are limited in the repertoire of slurs they can use against whites , and even the ones of which they can avail themselves sound more comic than hateful .
The impact of hearing the antiblack slurs in the skit was of a magnitude unparalleled by hearing Pryor say honky  over and over again .
As a white person I always saw terms like honky or cracker as evidence of how much more potent white racism was than any variation on the theme practiced by the black or brown .
When a group of people has little or no power over you institutionally , they dont get to define the terms of your existence , they cant limit your opportunities , and you neednt worry much about the use of a slur to describe you and yours , since , in all likelihood , the slur is as far as its going to go .
What are they going to do next : deny you a bank loan ?
Yeah , right .
So whereas nigger was and is a term used by whites to dehumanize blacks , to imply their inferiority , to put them in their place  if you will , the same cannot be said of honky : after all , you cant put white people in their place when they own the place to begin with .
Power is like body armor .
And while not all white folks have the same degree of power , there is a very real extent to which all of us have more than we need vis - à - vis people of color : at least when it comes to racial position , privilege and perceptions .
Consider poor whites .
To be sure , they are less financially powerful than wealthy people of color .
But that misses the point of how racial privilege operates within a class system .
Within a class system , people tend to compete for stuff against others of their same basic economic status .
In other words , rich and poor are not competing for the same homes , bank loans , jobs , or even educations to a large extent .
Rich competes against rich , working class against working class and poor against poor .
And in those competitions racial privilege most certainly attaches .
Poor whites are rarely typified as pathological , dangerous , lazy or shiftless the way poor blacks are , for example .
Nor are they demonized the way poor Latino / a immigrants tend to be .
When politicians want to scapegoat welfare recipients they dont pick Bubba and Crystal from some Appalachian trailer park ; they choose Shawonda Jefferson from the Robert Taylor Homes , with her seven children .
And according to reports from a number of states , ever since so - called welfare reform , white recipients have been treated far better by caseworkers , are less likely to be bumped off the rolls for presumed failure to comply with new regulations , and have been given far more assistance at finding new jobs than their black or brown counterparts .
Poor whites are more likely to have a job , tend to earn more than poor people of color , and are even more likely to own their own home .
Indeed , whites with incomes under $ 13,000 annually are more likely to own their own home than blacks with incomes that are three times higher due to having inherited property .
None of this is to say that poor whites arent being screwed eight ways to Sunday by an economic system that relies on their immiseration : they are .
But they nonetheless retain a certain one - up on equally poor or even somewhat better off people of color thanks to racism .
It is that one - up that renders the potency of certain prejudices less threatening than others .
It is what makes cracker or honky less problematic than any of the slurs used so commonly against the black and brown .
In response to all this , skeptics might say that people of color can indeed exercise power over whites , at least by way of racially - motivated violence .
Such was the case , for example , this week in New York City where a black man shot two whites and one Asian - Pacific Islander before being overpowered .
Apparently he announced that he wanted to kill white people , and had hoped to set a wine bar on fire to bring such a goal to fruition .
There is no doubt his act was one of racial bigotry , and that to those he was attempting to murder his power must have seemed quite real .
Yet there are problems with claiming that this power proves racism from people of color is just as bad as the reverse .
First , racial violence is also a power whites have , so the power that might obtain in such a situation is hardly unique to non-whites , unlike the power to deny a bank loan for racial reasons , to " steer " certain homebuyers away from living in nicer " neighborhoods , or to racially profile in terms of policing .
Those are powers that can only be exercised by the more dominant group as a practical and systemic matter .
Additionally , the " power " of violence is not really power at all , since to exercise it , one has to break the law and subject themselves to probable legal sanction .
Power is much more potent when it can be deployed without having to break the law to do it , or when doing it would only risk a small civil penalty at worst .
So discrimination in lending , though illegal is not going to result in the perp going to jail ; so too with employment discrimination or racial profiling .
There are plenty of ways that more powerful groups can deploy racism against less powerful groups without having to break the law : by moving away when too many of " them " move in ( which one can only do if one has the option of moving without having to worry about discrimination in housing . )
Or one can discriminate in employment but not be subjected to penalty , so long as one makes the claim that the applicant of color was " less qualified , " even though that determination is wholly subjective and rarely scrutinized to see if it was determined accurately , as opposed to being a mere proxy for racial bias .
In short , it is institutional power that matters most .
Likewise , its the difference in power and position that has made recent attempts by American Indian activists in Colorado to turn the tables on white racists so utterly ineffective .
Indian students at Northern Colorado University , fed up by the unwillingness of white school district administrators in Greeley to change the name and grotesque Indian caricature of the Eaton High School  Reds ,  recently set out to flip the script on the common practice of mascot - oriented racism .
Thinking they would show white folks what its like to be in their shoes  and experience the objectification of being a team icon , indigenous members of an intramural basketball team renamed themselves the  Fightin Whiteys ,  and donned t- shirts with the team mascot : a 1950 s - style caricature of a suburban , middle class white guy , next to the phrase every thangs gonna be all white . 
Funny though the effort was , it has not only failed to make the point intended , but indeed has been met with laughter and even outright support by white folks .
Rush Limbaugh actually advertised for the teams t- shirts on his radio program , and whites from coast to coast have been requesting team gear , thinking it funny to be turned into a mascot , as opposed to demeaning .
Of course the difference is that its tough to negatively objectify a group whose power and position allows them to define the meaning of another groups attempts at humor : in this case the attempt by Indians to teach them a lesson .
It s tough to school the headmaster , in other words .
Objectification works against the disempowered because they are disempowered .
The process doesnt work in reverse , or at least , making it work is a lot tougher than one might think .
Turning Indians into mascots has been offensive precisely because it is a continuation of the dehumanization of such persons over many centuries ; the perpetuation of the mentality of colonization and conquest .
It is not as if one group whites merely chose to turn another group Indians into mascots .
Rather , it is that one group , whites , have consistently viewed Indians as less than fully human , as savage , as wild ,  and have been able to not merely portray such imagery on athletic banners and uniforms , but in history books and literature more crucially .
In the case of the students at Northern , they would need to be a lot more acerbic in their appraisal of whites , in order for their attempts at reverse racism to make the point intended .
After all , fightin is not a negative trait in the eyes of most white folks , and the 1950s iconography chosen for the uniforms was unlikely to be seen as that big a deal .
Perhaps if they had settled on  slave - owning whiteys ,  or murdering whiteys ,  or land - stealing whiteys ,  or  smallpox - giving - on - purpose whiteys ,  or  Native - people - butchering whiteys ,  or mass raping whiteys ,  the point would have been made .
And instead of a smiling company man logo , perhaps a Klansman , or skinhead as representative of the white race : now that would have been a nice functional equivalent of the screaming Indian warrior .
But see , you gotta go strong to turn the tables on the man , and ironic sarcasm just aint gonna get it nine times out of ten .
Without the power to define another groups reality , Indian activists are simply incapable of turning the tables by way of well - placed humor .
Simply put , what separates white racism from any other form , and what makes anti-black , anti-brown , anti-yellow , or anti-red humor more biting and more dangerous than its anti-white equivalent is the ability of the former to become lodged in the minds of and perceptions of the citizenry .
White perceptions are what end up counting in a white - dominated society .
If whites say Indians are savages ( be they of the noble  or vicious type ) , then by God , theyll be seen as savages .
If Indians say whites are mayonnaise - eating Amway salespeople , who the hell is going to care ?
If anything , whites will simply turn it into a marketing opportunity .
When you have the power , you can afford to be self - deprecating , after all .
The day that someone produces a newspaper ad that reads :  Twenty honkies for sale today : good condition , best offer accepted ,  or  Cracker to be lynched tonight : whistled at black woman ,  then perhaps Ill see the equivalence of these slurs with the more common type to which weve grown accustomed .
When white churches start getting burned down by militant blacks who spray paint kill the honkies  on the sidewalks outside , then maybe Ill take seriously these concerns over reverse racism . 
Until then , I guess Ill find myself laughing at the thought of another old Saturday Night Live skit : this time with Garrett Morris as a convict in the prison talent show who sings :
Gonna get me a shotgun and kill all the whiteys I see .
Gonna get me a shotgun and kill all the whiteys I see .
And once I kill all the whiteys I see Then whitey he wont bother me Gonna get me a shotgun and kill all the whiteys I see .
Sorry , but it just is nt the same .

A former senior advisor to the U.S. Treasury and highly - regarded economics professor , Nouriel Roubini , says that Washington ’s bail outs are “ socialism for the rich , the well connected and Wall Street ; it is . . . a corrupt system where profits are privatized and losses are socialized . ”
In fact , this is a quintessential characteristic of economies run by fascist regimes .
For example , historian Gaetano Salvemini argued in 1936 that fascism makes taxpayers responsible to private enterprise , because " the State pays for the blunders of private enterprise ...
Profit is private and individual .
Loss is public and social " ( page 416 ) .
Why ?
Well , remember that one of the best definitions of fascism is the " merger of state and corporate power " .
And a significant agenda of fascists is to ensure loyalty from their nation 's corporations .
As an article on Wikipedia states :
In general , apart from the nationalizations of some industries , fascist economies were based on private property and private initiative , but these were contingent upon service to the state .
***
Fascist governments encouraged the pursuit of private profit and offered many benefits to large businesses , but they demanded in return that all economic activity should serve the " national interest " .
The bailout is - literally - fascist , because it socializes Wall Street 's losses and privatizes its gains , in order to further the merger between corporations and the state , to guarantee loyalty by Wall Street to Big Brother , and to reward the boys who have been " playing ball " with the Bush administration .
It is also , obviously , fascist because of how it is being rammed down America 's throat by authorian leaders , the way it would place government in charge of the markets , and to the extent that it would put Paulson 's actions above review by the courts .

On the Discovery Channel ’s MythBusters , Jamie Hyneman slays urban legends with the greatest of ease .
Since he ’s also a weird - energy enthusiast ( he once powered a small rocket with a salami ) , we asked him to help us separate the big ideas from the duds on the energy frontier .
ENERGY SOURCE : Cow manure
HOW IT WORKS :
In an anaerobic digester , bacteria break down manure and produce methane , which is trapped and used to generate electricity .
PLAUSIBLE : It ’s already being used in California . “ nasa actually investigated this , because if you ’re going to Mars and you ’ve got people on board , you ’ve got poo , ” says Hyneman .
ENERGY SOURCE : Human motion
HOW IT WORKS : Create a “ crowd farm ” like the Sustainable Dance Club in Rotterdam .
BUSTED : JH : “ Go for the babies .
Just put them on a little treadmill and let ’em rip . ”
ENERGY SOURCE : Magnetic motors
HOW IT WORKS : Evangelical entrepreneur Dennis Lee claims his 500 % - efficient motors will bring free energy and “ an abundance of wealth for worldwide end - times evangelism . ”
BUSTED : There ’s no sign the technology actually works , but Lee has gotten rich selling dealerships to true believers .
JH : “ I ’ve gotten so that I can smell these things a mile away . ”
ENERGY SOURCE : Unicellular green algae
HOW IT WORKS : Deprived of sulfur and oxygen , they produce high yields of hydrogen .
PLAUSIBLE : JH : “ Algae are such basic , simple organisms .
If you optimize them , they are going to produce massive quantities of whatever you have tailored them to . ”
ENERGY SOURCE : Raindrops
HOW IT WORKS : The Atomic Energy Commission uses special plastic to convert raindrops ’ falling motion into electricity .
BUSTED : JH : “ A when - pigs - fly kind of scenario .
It ’s millions of times more efficient to collect hydroelectric power through a dam than raindrop by raindrop . ”
ENERGY SOURCE : Old tires
HOW IT WORKS : Microwave enthusiast Frank Pringle found that nuking tires in a vacuum creates diesel fuel , combustible gas , carbon black , and high - strength steel .
BUSTED : JH : Tires do contain hydrocarbons , but “ it requires a relatively huge amount of energy to do that conversion .
I ’m a little suspicious of using microwaves . ”
ENERGY SOURCE : Empty space
HOW IT WORKS : Thomas Bearden says he can use vacuum energy to power a generator .
BUSTED : JH : “ The universe is filled with energy , but pulling energy out of a vacuum or something — there ’s no substance there as far as I ’m aware . ”
ENERGY SOURCE : Grape juice
HOW IT WORKS : NanoLogix uses bacteria to convert Welch ’s sugar runoff into hydrogen .
PLAUSIBLE : JH :
As with algae , “ with microbes there is no bottleneck to slow you down . ”
ENERGY SOURCE : Dirty diapers
HOW IT WORKS : A British company turns poop and plastic from diapers into gas and oil .
BUSTED : JH : “ Are you really going to be able to isolate diapers in such huge volumes that you ’re running your entire country off of gasoline powered by diapers ?
No . ”
ENERGY SOURCE : Greenhouse gases
HOW IT WORKS : Los Alamos scientists propose exposing air to potassium carbonate , which absorbs carbon dioxide that is then converted into methanol , gasoline , or jet fuel .
PLAUSIBLE : JH : “ How do you come up with the energy to do this conversion ?
If you can get it from something like sunlight , then there is your free lunch . ”

An elderly Bulgarian woman got the shock of her life when her cow suddenly reared up and mount her – causing her donkey to collapse in laughter .
Rositza Kasaboba had been returning home with her animals after letting them graze in a nearby field in the village of Krustatitsa when the bizarre scene was captured by a local photographer .
The cow , named Dana , sent Rosita crashing to the ground , leaving her " battered and bruised " but otherwise unscathed .
After recovering from her ordeal , the 68 - year - old said : " My cow has never done such a thing before .
" Worst of all - even my donkey collapsed afterwards on the ground , I am sure it was laughing at me . "
Unlike her donkey , Rosita did n’t appear to see the funny side of the incident , and has vowed to make sausages for Christmas from the unruly cow .
Magicians Penn and Teller are whizzes when it comes to performing offbeat , weird , funny and gross sleights of hand and other tricks .
But they ’re neither scientists nor fair and objective journalists ( not that many of today ’s so - called “ mainstream ” journalists are either ) .
So it pays to view their scam - and myth - debunking efforts with a healthy dose of critical thinking .
Case in point : their Showtime channel program , “ Bullshit ! ” I ’ve watched most of the early episodes , and they ’re highly entertaining , because that ’s what Penn and Teller are : entertainers .
But their fact - checking and analyses can leave much to be desired , as when — for example — they “ debunk ” global warming with the help of libertarian think tanks like the Cato Institute , .. without turning to real scientific sources like say , oh , NASA ’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies or the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration .
Their 2004 episode slamming recycling has been garnering big Internet traffic and lots of social networking hits … presumably because a lot of people take glee in seeing enviro - minded hippies put in their place .
There are a few problems with the episode , though :
Recycling is B.S. … Except When It ’s Not
After spending about 15 minutes making the case against recycling — it ’s unnecessary , we ’re not running out of resources , it costs more than it ’s worth , it creates pollution — Penn and Teller acknowledge , yeah , it makes sense to recycle aluminum cans and other metals .
So recycling is n’t entirely B.S. , even in their eyes .
( The photo accompanying this post , by the way , is of cow dung cakes drying in the sun .
In places like Punjab , India , where this picture was taken , even B.S. , apparently , is not B.S. but a valuable source of fuel and fertilizer . )
Everything is Relative
At one point in the recycling episode , Penn and Teller rail on about the pointlessness of recycling plastics , which they say will make sense only when “ there ’ll be money for street people in picking up plastic . ”
You know what ?
There is … in the poorest slums of India , Bangladesh and other developing countries .
It ’s not that there ’s no money in recyclables … it ’s that a couple of pennies does n’t make much difference to the average U.S. resident , which that amount could mean the difference between eating or not for a seven - year - old rag - picker in Mumbai .
The Times , They Are a ’Changing
To bolster their arguments , Penn and Teller cite a 2004 study on recycling myths by Clemson University economist Daniel K. Benjamin .
Benjamin identifies myth number five as this : “ We squander irreplaceable resources when we do n’t recycle . ”
And then , he continues , “ What about non-renewable resources such as fossil fuel ?
Here , too , there is no reason to fear that we will run out .
Despite repeated forecasts by the federal government and others that we shall soon run out of oil , it has n’t happened .
Indeed , as we continue to use more oil , the standard measures of proven oil reserves get larger , not smaller . ”
Reading that today , in mid-2008 , does any part of that paragraph strike you as , um , a bit off ?
( Hint : $ 147 a barrel crude . )
So maybe oil ’s the exception , right ?
Except , maybe not .
Also making the news for their increasing scarcity are gallium , indium , hafnium , platinum , helium , zinc , copper and , oh , water .
Recycling is Just One Piece of the Puzzle
Finally , I ’ll grant the magical duo this : “ recycling ” alone is n’t the answer to our environmental and resource challenges .
“ Reduce ” and “ reuse ” are also critical .
By making plastic bottles that are thinner and lighter , for example , beverage companies could use 30 percent less resin and save about $ 1.5 billion on year on raw materials .
And if the U.S. could start imitating some parts of Europe , we would n’t need to recycle … we could simply refill .
Of course , there will still always be some people who think refilling , reducing and reusing are B.S. too .
Sigh .
UPDATED SEPT 17 4:05 PM
CST : NYC Housing Authority spokesman Howard Marder has now officially confirmed that Barry Jennings indeed passed away approximately a month ago after several days in the hospital , matching confirmations from several other employees at the Housing Authority .
Marder commented that Jennings was a great man , well liked by everyone at the Housing Authority , and that he would be missed .
No other details were available .
Emergency coordinator and 9/11 witness Barry Jennings has passed away with controversy about WTC7 still hot– as the BBC hit piece and NIST report have been released to counter Jennings ’ exclusive testimony of explosions inside Building 7
Authority , has passed away at age 53 from circumstances not yet disclosed .
A spokesperson for the Housing Authority has now confirmed his death , after weeks of rumors circulating online , but refused to give any further details .
This office has not yet been able to contact anyone in the Jennings family and the official cause of death is not yet known , but online comments have reported the date of death as August 19 , 2008 .
It is very unusual that a prominent — and controversial– 9/11 witness would die only days before the release of NIST ’s report on WTC7 and shortly after a firestorm erupted over his testimony that he heard explosions inside the building prior to collapse of either tower and that there were dead bodies in the building ’s blown - out lobby .
( Article continues below )
The BBC aired The Third Tower in July in attempt to debunk Barry Jennings ’ account– which is both contradictory and damaging to the official 9/11 story – by making issue over whether or not he said he “ saw ” dead bodies in the lobby .
Yet Jennings own statement in an exclusive interview with Dylan Avery and Jason Bermas– which has not been denied– was : “ The fire fighter who took us down kept saying , ‘ Do n’t look down . ’
And I said , ‘ Why . ’
And we were stepping over people– you know , you can feel when you ’re stepping over people . ”
Now the release of Jason Bermas ’ Fabled Enemies is giving further exposure to Jennings ’ controversial account .
The film features a full interview with Barry Jennings , as well as the statements he and Michael Hess , who was also trapped with him inside WTC7 , made to news media on the day of the attacks .
Barry Jennings reiterated in the exclusive interview his confusion over the explanation for WTC7 ’s collapse– given that he clearly heard explosions inside the building :
“ I ’m just confused about one thing , and one thing only – why World Trade Center 7 went down in the first place .
I ’m very confused about that .
I know what I heard– I heard explosions .
The explanation I got was it was the fuel - oil tank .
I ’m an old boiler guy– if it was a fuel - oil tank , it would have been one side of the building . ”
That interview was not released until June 2008 at the request of Mr. Jennings , who had received numerous threats to his job and asked that it be left out of Loose Change : Final Cut because of those threats .
Jennings statements have lit fire to questions about what really caused the sudden collapse of WTC7 just as NIST had hoped the release of their report would quash widespread beliefs that the building was brought down by controlled demolition .
News of Jennings ’ death comes on the heels of losing another 9/11 hero and eyewitness– Kenny Johannemann , who reportedly committed suicide 12 days before the seventh anniversary of 9/11 .
Johannemann is credited with saving at least one man ’s life on 9/11 and was also a witness to explosions in the towers .
NIST ’s report , as well as that of the 9/11 Commission ( which did not even mention WTC7 ) , completely ignored statements from the building leaseholder Larry Silverstein as well as numerous police , fire fighters and other eyewitnesses who have testified that they were warned about the building ’s collapse and told to get back .
One rescue worker even heard a countdown for the building ’s implosion .
Unfortunately , Barry Jennings , whose testimony was ignored by the 9/11 Commission , can no longer raise questions personally about his experience inside WTC7 , but his account will remain on the record and what he witnessed about 9/11 cannot be ignored .
The truth about WTC7 will come out , and Barry Jennings ’ testimony will not be in vain .
Please contact [ email protected ] if you have any information about the circumstances of Barry ’s death or any other reports .
We extend our condolences to any family or friends reading this for their loss .

Peter Molyneux has earned himself a reputation for being a bit of a hype - maestro , often building unrealistic expectations for his videogames by getting too excited and making wild promises .
After his confession about Fable II 's negative points , however , one can't accuse the man of not trying to lower the hopes of fans .
From poor lip - syncing to a " fractured " dog , Molyneux ' fesses up .
" There are low spots in the game and it's no one 's fault that these low spots are there , it 's just that there 's a lot to this game .
You 've got to remember that we 're not building a corridor game here where you can say ' right , in one hour fifteen minutes , someone 's going see that light and we 're going make that light like this . '
" I think the lip - sync is pretty bad , you know , the quality of the animation falls off , you know , quite a lot , I think the navigation can be a bit dodgy sometimes , I think the dog can get a bit fractured sometimes .
But those are sideline issues , you 're not going to care about those , they 're technical issues , and I wish we'd had time to polish every single tiny second of the game . "
Molyneux admitted that there are " things to criticize " in Fable II but insists that he is still " incredibly proud " of what he and his team have created .
The British mastermind also stated that by not trying to cram as many features as possible into one game , he has n't repeated the mistakes made with the original Fable .
A rare show of humilty from the Hypemaster General , although he 's obviously confident enough in the overall product that he feels comfortable pointing out the problems .
Damn his lyp - sync talk though , because I know that the second I start playing the game , I wo n't be able to stop myself watching the characters ' mouths .
The Bugatti Veyron is among the most exclusive cars in the world , a 1,000 - horsepower super exotic owned by fewer than 150 people .
Every one of them is about to be upstaged by the drop - dead gorgeous roadster Bugatti will unveil later this month at the Pebble Beach Concours .
Bugatti pulled the wraps off the stunning Veyron 16.4 Grand Sport this morning .
The company is n't saying much about the car before its Aug. 16 premier , but does say that structural changes and other innovations make the roadster as rigid – and safe – as the coupe , which does zero to 60 in as little as 2.3
seconds ( Bugatti claims 2.5 ) and tops out at 253 mph .
The top looks opaque but is actually clear , and the car looks just as good with it as without .
Aerodynamic tweaks improve airflow , allowing the two lucky occupants to enjoy the growl of the Veyron 's 16 - cylinder engine and the blurred landscape passing at 215 250 mph without mussing their hair .
Want one ?
Get in line .
Word has it Bugatti will build just 80 Grand
Sports at
$ 2.25 million apiece , but it 's not clear if those 80 are included in the 300 Veyrons the company will build .
The first Grand Sport will be auctioned Aug. 17 at the concours .

WiFi Radiation Affects Child in School
by Sara Middleton
( NaturalHealth365 )
These days , many parents choose to provide their children with cell phones .
It ’s not necessarily a bad idea , because when used properly cell phones can provide essential communication and keep children safe .
But , a question still remains : is WiFi ( wireless ) radiation harmful ?
From cell phones and WiFi routers at home to free WiFi at schools , children are exposed to a significant amount of wireless radiation every day .
Unfortunately , many parents , schoolteachers , and guardians do n’t realize the potential dangers of microwaves and wireless internet connections .
For example , just take one girl ’s testimony about her experience with “ microwave sickness , ” aka electromagnetic sensitivity .
It will certainly make you think twice about the technology .

Two new studies have received little notice in the media , perhaps because their findings tell young people caught up in dieting and the desire to be thin , that they need to eat more and have more body fat .
For years , biology professor Anne Loucks , and colleagues at Ohio University have been researching the effects of retrained eating and undereating on teens and young women .
Their studies have shown that too few calories disrupt bone formation among women even into their thirties .
Their latest research highlighted that hunger and irregular menstrual periods are n’t good indicators of whether women are undereating ; and that among those who were n’t eating enough calories , bone formation was suppressed even among those with normal body fat .
The problem appeared not just with anorexia , but was especially pronounced among those exercise intensely .
“ Regular menstrual cycles do not reliably indicate that they are eating enough for what they ’re expending , ” Dr. Loucks said to the New York Times .
The second study was highlighted by writer Harriet Brown .
Last fall , she ’d authored a powerful piece in the New York Times on the painful process of trying to help her daughter through recovery from anorexia .
“ Once the [ normal ] physiological process of starvation kicks in , the disease takes on a life of its own , unfolding with predictable symptoms , intensity and long - term consequences , ” she learned .
Her family ’s incredible story will go right to the heart of any parent .
On her blog this week , though , she mentioned a new study out of Columbia University looking at preventing relapse among anorexia nervosa patients .
It was an analysis of a small one - year trial of anorectics who had recovered their weight and were randomized to receive either an antidepressant medication or a placebo .
All also received individual cognitive behavioral therapy specifically designed to prevent relapse .
“ A major contributor to the poor prognosis of this illness is the high rate of relapse following initial treatment , ” wrote the researchers from New York State Psychiatric Institute / Columbia University Medical Center .
“ Despite successful weight restoration , 30 % to 50 % of patients require rehospitalization within 1 year of discharge . ”
Their findings concurred with other studies and found that anti-depressants were of no benefit in recovering from anorexia .
This new paper found that none of the usual physical measures of successful treatment predicted a sustained clinical recovery — not BMI , subtype of eating disorder , waist - to - hip ratio , serum cortisol or leptin levels .
Only “ lower percent body fat was associated with poor long - term outcome . ”
Mrs. Brown wrote a moving appeal to young people suffering from anorexia : Repeat after me :
Fat is good .... We 're so used to thinking of fat as the Ultimate Evil , which must be banished at any cost , that news like this can feel downright shocking .
Fat can be not just good but essential .
Without it our brains do n't work very well .
We 're supposed to have a certain amount of fat in our bodies .
This is important for those in recovery from anorexia , especially people ( like my own daughter ) who are naturally athletic and build a lot of muscle mass .
Nothing wrong with muscles , but you 've gotta have fat , too .
Lean muscle mass without body fat is associated with relapse .
And that 's not what anybody wants .
So repeat after me :
Fat is necessary for human life .
Fat is not evil .
Fat can even ( dare I say it ? ) be a Very Good Thing .
It might seem astonishing that such a simple , common sense message is a revolutionary idea for many young people today .
It can be difficult for older adults to realize just how powerful the fear of fat is among young people , and just how dramatically restrictive beliefs have become about how much fat our bodies should have .
What healthy bodies , of all shapes and sizes , look like is n't what 's most in the media .
Most girls and young women , for instance , feel that to be healthy and fit , they need to have body fat percentages so low that they are more in keeping with young boys .
At first , it can be hard to understand the depth of such beliefs among young people .
But they 've become so common nowadays , that people of all ages accept them ; yet , at least Babyboomers and Seniors have had something in their pasts to help keep a balanced perspective .
While the cultural and medical admonitions to be thin were building when we were growing up , experts were giving us body fat recommendations that still were considerably higher than young people generally hear today .
Back then , women heard that an average healthy twenty - year - old female had 28.7 % body fat , by middle age healthy women averaged 38 % fat , which increased to 41.5 % by age 60 .
Similarly , guys were told that the average twenty year old man had 11 % body fat and the average fifty year old had 25.8 % .
Just try to find consumer information close to that today .
I spent an entire day , trying every permutation of web search terms , and discovered the internet has been wiped clean of practically anything but the need to have low body fat percentages — percentiles lower than has ever been normal or considered healthy — and the dangers of fat .
Admonitions against body fat dominate , saying that too many of us are fat and that just because it ’s “ normal does n’t mean it ’s healthy . ”
Today , even mature adults are expected to have body fat percentages of twenty year olds .
Few consumers probably hear about those inconsistencies in studies , such as conducted at St. Luke 's - Roosevelt Hospital Center in New York a few years ago which found that middle - aged men and women who had BMIs in “ normal ranges , had body fat percentages of 24 % and 38 % , respectively .
And a recent study of Japanese adults , aged 20 to 79 , conducted at the Okayama Southern Institute of Health , found that body fat percentages of average , healthy men and women with “ normal ” BMIs were 25.1 % and 34.6 % , respectively .
And the Greek study on perimenopausal women , which found the average body fat percentages among women with “ normal ” BMIs was 36.5 % .
What is humorous is that with each one , even though the adults were all healthy and at government - recommended BMIs , the researchers still said their study revealed that people were too fat , with “ undesirably high body fat percentages . ”
This sports medicine advisor is not atypical in the extremely low body fat percentages being heard by young people today .
Note that what was considered normal and healthy less than two decades ago , is now seen as indicative of disease :
The minimum percent body fat considered safe for good health is 5 % for males and 12 % for females .
The average adult body fat is closer to 15 % - 18 % for men and 22 % - 25 % for women ....
For men over 25 % and women over 32 % fat , there is a dramatic correlation with illness and disease .
The drive for thinness has reached extremes , with thinner believed to be ideal and any amount of fat thought to be dangerous and a risk for early death .
But this is n’t based on credible science .
In fact , according to obesity researcher Dr. Paul Ernsberger , Ph.D. , who conducted a review of over 400 studies on the health implications of obesity , “ there is widespread agreement that reduced adiposity plays little or no role in ... life - prolonging and cancer - preventing effects . ”
Even in studies of mutant mice , a number of studies have shown that the heavier animals in each treatment group live longer than the lighter ones , he said .
Those mice bred for obesity who are overfed later in life to make them obese still live longer than controls , with “ a continuous positive relationship between body weight and longevity . ”
In humans , severe food deprivation early in life has many adverse effects and shortens life expectancy ....
One marker of human aging , the menopause , appears several years later in fat women than in lean women .
There is no evidence for retarded aging or prolonged life expectancy in lean or underfed humans .
When Dr. Kim - Anh Do , Ph.D. , now professor of biostatistics at MD Anderson Cancer Center and Rice University in Houston , TX , led a large Australian twin study on the predictive factors for menopause , she wrote that it is generally agreed that among contemporary industrialized populations , the age of menopause rises with better nourishment .
The association between fatness and slower aging is one few have probably heard about .
Yet , “ early menopause may be a risk factor for earlier mortality from diseases related to decreased estrogen levels and may promote increased incidence of osteoporosis , heart disease , diabetes , hypertension , breast cancer , osteoarthritis , and autoimmune disease , ” said Dr. Do . “ Recent results also suggest that irregular menstrual cycles , dieting , and stress ( especially in African American women ) are also predictive of earlier median age at menopause . ”
While kids and young people need n’t be worried sick about what chronic disease may befall them when they get older , many do .
And a surprising number are already afraid that their fat means they ’re going to die earlier .
We should n’t be surprised , given the recent popularity of the claim that the effects of long - term obesity have never been seen before and this could be the first generation to die sooner than they ’re parents .
Researchers at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , however , demonstrated this claim is n’t the case .
In the CDC ’s Epidemiological Follow - up Study following people ’s BMI through their lives , they explained that we ’ve already seen the long - term effects of obesity on longevity .
And what the evidence shows is no association between longevity and BMI , with higher BMIs associated with longer , healthier lives .
In today ’s anti-fat climate , the fact that the evidence has shown such “ obesity paradoxes ” for decades sounds unbelievable .
We ’ve looked at the fat advantages in cancer and infections , kidney dialysis , diabetes , and cardiac death .
The protective effect of body fat is even seen among people with hypertension , said Dr. Ernsberger , with most studies reporting lower mortality in fat hypertensives than in lean ones .
As much as five times difference .
The hypertension seen in fat people differs in several says from ordinary essential hypertensin , he said .
“ Plasma volume and cardiac output are increased while total peripheral resistance is unchanged , in marked contrast to the contracted plasma volume and elevated peripheral resistance characteristic of nonobese essential hypertension . ”
They have normal stroke volumes and do n’t have the elevated peripheral resistance of thinner hypertensives , which compromises blood flow to vital organs such as the kidneys .
These differences may be part of the reason why fat people appear to have improved survival of cardiovascular disease .
The bottom line is that we need n’t fear our body ’s natural fat — however much and places our genes have determined each of us is to have .
It ’s there for some pretty wondrous reasons .

ATLANTA , Sept 30 ( Reuters ) - Opposing the White House ’s Wall Street bailout and letting stocks take a beating was a worthwhile price to pay to keep a “ socialist bill ” from meddling in the free market , conservative U.S. talk radio said on Tuesday .
Many of the influential hosts strongly oppose the rescue plan proposed last week by U.S. President George W. Bush , once a talk - radio favorite , as inappropriate government intervention in the free market likely to make the situation worse , not better .
Congress will live to regret it if the $ 700 billion bill were passed hastily , they said , urging lawmakers to spend more time on a search for a solution that adheres to conservative ideals .
“ I should n’t say this , but I ’m going to say it anyway .
Screw the market ! ....
OK , I ’ll take that back , not screw the market but let me tell you something , ” conservative talk show host Rush Limbaugh said as part of his analysis of Monday ’s events .
“ When the government fails to pass a socialism bill and the market goes south , let it go south .
I do n’t want to pass a socialism bill just to protect the stock market , ” said Limbaugh , by far the most popular host on U.S. radio .
“ This raw deal would make things worse , ” he said on Tuesday .
U.S. lawmakers in the House of Representatives rejected the bailout package on Monday after most of House Democrats supported it , but a majority of House Republicans opposed it .
The surprise failure sent the market into a record tailspin and prompted a flood of bickering and fingerpointing from both parties .
Stocks recovered somewhat on Tuesday and Congress will have a chance to vote again or change the bill when it reconvenes on Thursday .
While conservatives said they recognized the seriousness of the market ’s fall , they would hold fast to their principles that on the economy include low taxes , small government and fiscal responsibility .
‘ NOT PARTICULARLY DISTRESSED ’
“ I ’m not particularly distressed that the bailout bill did not pass .
I want to see this thing ( the bill ) flesh itself out a little over a period of days , ” said talk show host Neal Boortz , who describes himself as a libertarian .
Hoping to win more support for the rescue plan , Bush said on Tuesday the U.S. economy was depending on decisive action or the economic damage could be “ painful and lasting . ”
But part of the problem for some conservatives was a lack of confidence in a president they once saw as a champion of their cause for his commitment to tax cuts and his firm response to the Sept. 11 attacks .
They blame the Democrats for the home mortgage crisis at the root of the problem , saying liberals put pressure on mortgage finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to make housing loans to people who could not afford to repay them .
“ I do n’t trust you ( Bush ) and when you start screaming now of dire consequences if we do n’t get a bailout bill , I do n’t trust you .
I need convincing and apparently there are a lot of members of Congress who feel the same way , ” Boortz said , in a view echoed by several of his listeners .
Some callers to the shows said they did not appreciate what they saw as scare tactics used by Bush and Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson .
“ It almost sounds like they are demagoguing and preaching that the sky is falling , which makes me skeptical , ” one said .
Tens of millions of conservatives tune in to AM talk radio and trust its nationally syndicated hosts more than media outlets they say have a liberal bias .
Several of the hosts say they are engaged in a long struggle to persuade the Republican Party and the country to return to its conservative roots and they see the bailout bill as an important test of their strength .

Unlocking The Power Of Case Equality : Proc#===
Update :
The concepts we proposed in this article have been implemented in Ruby 1.9 .
The ‘ === ’ operator is known as the case equality operator and is used when testing cases in case statements .
Many classes take advantage of this by implementing their own versions of ‘ === ’ to enable developers to write neat , compact code .
It ’s use could potentially be expanded even further .
For instance in the following case statement :
1 case number 2 when 1 : puts " One " 3 when 2 .. 10 : puts " Between two and ten " 4 when String : puts " Not a number " 5 end
for each ‘ when ’ statement the ‘ === ’ operator is called on the when argument ( 1,2..10 , String ) and the case argument ( number ) is used as the RHS of the comparison .
For line 2 the comparison done will be ‘ 1 === number ’ .
For most classes ‘ === ’ is just an alias to ‘ == ’ however some classes redefine ‘ === ’ to allow for better functionality in case statements .
Range redefines ‘ 1..10 === 5 ’ to ‘ 1..10.include ?( 5 ) ’ and Regex redefines ‘/ abcdef / === “ abcdef ” ’ to ‘/ abcdef / =~ “ abcdef ” ’ ( the Regexp matching operator ) .
Consider also the fact that Range , Regexp and Class can match multiple parameter values against the same object with ‘ === ’ .
Any integer from 1 to 10 will cause ‘ 1..10 === num ’ to evaluate to true .
Similarily “ aaa ” , “ baaab ” and “ caaac ” all satisfy the RHS of ‘/ aaa / === str ’ and 1,2 and 3 will satisfy the RHS of ‘ Integer === number ’ .
But what about Proc ?
In Ruby a Proc is a block of executable code , an anonymous function which can be passed around as if it were data .
Like ‘ ===’ , a Proc can map a number of arguments to either a true or false value ( although in Ruby it could have a number of outputs but only ‘ nil ’ and ‘ false ’ will be considered false ) .
So there is justification that Proc should have an ‘ === ’ operator .
For instance given two Proc objects as follows :
1 multiple_of_3 = lambda do |number| 2 number.modulo( 3 ) .zero ? 3 end 4 multiple_of_7 = lambda do |number| 5 number.modulo( 7 ) .zero ?
6 end
we want
1 multiple_of_3 === 14 # => false 2 multiple_of_7 === 14 # => true
so that
1 case 14 2 when multiple_of_3 : puts " Multiple of 3 " 3 when multiple_of_7 : puts " Multiple of 7 " 4 end
will satisfy the expression on line 3 and output “ Multiple of 7 ” to the screen .
Implementing this in Ruby is easy , we simply take the parameter to === and pass it as the parameter to Proc#call :
1 class Proc 2 def === ( * parameters ) 3 self .call ( * parameters ) 4 end 5 end
Using the splat operator allows for Proc to use ‘ === ’ with multiple parameters , you merely specify the parameters in an array .
So given the following Proc :
1 multiples_of_5 = Proc .new{|*parameters| parameters.all?{|i| i.modulo( 5 ) .zero?}}
then line 2 will be satisfied
1 case [ 5 , 10 , 15 ] 2 when multiples_of_3 : puts " Multuples of 5 " 3 when multuples_of_5 : puts " Multiples of 7 " 4 end
Now creating Procs for each case is a bit tiresome and does n’t seem to save any keystrokes but using Ruby ’s ability to dynamically create Procs we can define a function to do it for us :
1 def multiple_of ( factor ) 2 Proc .new{|product| product.modulo(factor ).zero?} 3 end 4 5 case number 6 when multiple_of ( 3 ) : puts " Multiple of 3 " 7 when multiple_of ( 7 ) : puts " Multuple of 7 " 8 end
Put the ‘ multiple_of ’ function in a utility library and your resultant code looks pretty neat and tidy .
In our next posting in the “ Unlocking The Power Of Case Equality ” series of posts we ’ll talk about how Enumerable could take advantage of case equality .

GOP Senator references stoner movie , album in floor speech David Edwards and Nick Juliano
Published : Wednesday September 24 , 2008

One would n't normally expect two pillars of pot-aficionado pop culture to make their way into the Congressional Record , let alone from a conservative midwestern senator .
But that 's precisely what happened Tuesday afternoon .
Sen. Chuck Grassley ( R - IA ) referenced the movie " Dude , Where 's My Car ? " and the Pink Floyd album " Dark Side of the Moon " during a speech on an taxes and fuel efficiency .
The display puzzled the scribes at Roll Call 's Heard on the Hill gossip column .
HOH couldnt quite follow the analogy Grassley was making when he stood before a blown - up poster of the Pink Floyd album cover , which features a large prism against a celestial background with a beam of light passing through it .
 Dark Side of the Moon is considered a classic among the stoner set , particularly when played simultaneously with the movie  The Wizard of Oz ,  with the sound turned down .
Or so we hear .
The Iowan was trying somehow to say that the prism image was a metaphor for the compromise Republicans and Democrats should make on tax legislation .
In the metaphor , the prism represented the compromise , while the refracted beam of light represented policies like tax extenders and alternative minimum tax .
We think .
Before waxing eloquent about strands of light  and the shards of a fractured prism , Grassley made it clear that he wasnt a devotee of Pink Floyd  unlike the legions of college kids whose dorm walls that same image graces  just that he found its artwork useful to illustrate his point .
 Now , I m not of course a big fan of rock music ,  Grassley intoned .
 Im not a fan of its lyrics and its culture . 
But , perhaps unwittingly , Grassley was on a roll with the stoner allusions , including a glance at the 2000 movie  Dude , Wheres My Car ?  starring Iowa native Ashton Kutcher , which follows the travails of two potheads who cant remember where , um , they left their car .
After finishing with the prism analogy , Grassley went on to talk about energy conservation , noting that many public officials have air - conditioned cars idling while waiting for them at curbs , wasting gas .
Grassley proudly noted that he drives his own car , thank you very much , including a Ford Taurus he keeps in Iowa .
 If you do see anyone else driving my car , please call the police , because someone has stolen my car ,  he said .
 Id like to refer to Ashton Kutcher here , from Cedar Rapids , Iowa , saying dude , wheres my car ?
A Grassley spokesperson insisted the senator was n't trying any shout outs to the Cheech & Chong set with his speech .
" No one here is versed in that aspect of pop culture , " she told Roll Call .

Full text of Grassley 's speech is reprinted below :
Mr. GRASSLEY .
Madam President , I am pleased that we are finally discussing legislation that is designed to deal with time - sensitive tax matters .
I thank Chairman Baucus for his cooperation in working in a bipartisan way on this legislation .
There are five categories of time - sensitive tax matters .
These are things that are sunset .
For those in the public who do n't recognize the word ``sunset , '' at certain times , legislation comes to an end and must be reenacted .
That is called sunset .
The first category of this sunset legislation is the alternative minimum tax fix .
It expired on December 31 of last year .
If we do n't act , 24 million families will face an average tax increase of at least $ 2,000 each .
The second category of tax relief includes several tax benefits available to middle - income taxpayers .
These expired also December 31 of last year .
Included are deductions for out - of - pocket expenses for teachers who buy supplies for their classrooms , sales tax in various States that have a sales tax but not income tax , and college tuition for middle - income families .
Millions of taxpaying families would face an unexpected tax increase if this sunset legislation is not reenacted .
The third category in the bill consists of many valuable business incentives , such as the research and development tax credit that has likewise expired and has put corporations in a position of not doing research and development or maybe wondering whether the tax incentives are going to be available to them .
This will reenact incentives such as that .
In this time of high oil prices and instability in the energy market , Congress should send a clear signal in support of alternative energy and conservation .
This very important issue is dealt with in the fourth category in this bill .
We will be considering that issue today to send a strong signal in support of alternative and renewable energy , as well as conservation .
We will not let the wide assortments of tax incentives for alternative energy and conservation expire this year , which would otherwise
happen .
The fifth and final category deals with the disasters that have ravaged the Nation 's heartland , especially my State of Iowa and , of course , most recently the gulf coast , particularly along Galveston .
We need to respond to help these folks in these regions , and these tax incentives are meant to help both business rehabilitation , as well as individual rehabilitation .
I believe this legislation is must - do business .
Congress cannot dawdle any longer .
And with a sense of emergency and urgency , Senator Reid and Senator McConnell , the leaders of the Senate , have devised a path for the Senate to complete action on these provisions .
I would rather have processed this legislation over a period of time .
Several months ago would have been a better time to process this sensitive business .
Better late than never , and this is late , and better to do it
now than not to get the job done at all .
Our leaders provided Chairman Baucus and me with the authority to do a compromise .
That , of course , was a critical step .
I am glad our leaders were able to get together on that point .
So Chairman Baucus and I pulled out our note pads and resharpened our pencils and , of course , here we are with this bipartisan compromise .
I am confident that the Senate will approve the first and third amendments that will be before the Senate .
The first amendment will deal with the fully offset energy tax incentives package that I will deal with in some detail in a minute .
The third amendment will contain a bipartisan compromise on the alternative minimum tax fix and , of course , these business extenders to which I have referred .
In between those two bipartisan amendments will be an amendment to be offered by Senator Reid for the Democratic caucus .
All amendments will face a 60 - vote threshold .
Last year , I laid out the principles Senate Republicans would follow when it came to revenue raisers , and those principles are still in effect , somewhat modified by the bill before us .
But the basic rationale behind the Senate Republicans on revenue raisers is still there .
The first principle I laid out is whether the proposal is good tax policy .
If the proposal is good tax policy , then we would support , and vice versa , not support if it is bad tax policy .
The compromise before us meets fully the needs of all Republicans on this point that the principles of this bill are good tax policy .
The crackdown on offshore deferred compensation plans is appropriate tax policy .
I am pleased we made it tougher on hedge fund managers by removing a charitable loophole .
Likewise , the offsets in the energy portion of the bill are appropriate policy .
The second principle I laid out last year deals with how revenue raisers are accounted for .
This is where our two parties differ .
How do the two caucuses differ ?
Republicans do not want to go down the slippery slope of building in a bias toward automatic tax increases -- I should say almost automatic tax increases -- and against current law tax relief .
This is especially compelling when appropriations are wholly outside the Democratic version of their pay - as - you - go principle .
Let me explain that we find it in our Republican caucus inconsistent that Democrats would say , when you are going to continue existing tax policy , you need to raise taxes on other Americans to pay for it .
We believe existing [ Page : S9236 ]
tax policy should be continued without offset .
The inconsistency for us comes from the Democratic point of view that if you want more spending in appropriations bills , you do n't have to pay for it .
We find that highly inconsistent .
Also , I could say that expiring entitlement spending does not figure in to the Democratic caucus 's pay - as - you - go proposition - - another inconsistency .
The Democratic version of pay as you go sets us down an irreversible path of higher taxes and higher spending .
If expiring tax relief and expiring spending and appropriations were treated similarly , maybe the deficit reduction rationale behind pay as you go would be credible .
As it exists now , it only reinforces an ideology of higher taxes and higher spending .
The rejection of Senator McConnell 's deficit - neutral offer on alternative minimum tax and the extenders proves my point .
I will
refer to a chart which shows the bias toward more spending and against current law tax relief .
If we look at that chart , we see the red line is one of mandatory expiring spending .
We see the annual increase in nondefense discretionary spending going up very much .
We see the annual cost of increased AMT , the solid green line , going down , and we see making certain other tax provisions permanent and what that does .
In any event , we found ourselves at an impasse on this point , but we still were able to reach this compromise that is before us .
In getting to that compromise , Democrats insisted on offsetting current law tax relief , and Republicans resisted more tax and spend .
Republicans were willing to use revenue raisers for new policy and for long - term or permanent tax policy .
Republicans did not want to use revenue raisers for new spending .
We came to a compromise by looking at this impasse as kind of a prism .
A prism breaks one beam of light into several different shades .
I have a chart showing the most famous prism of recent decades .
It is a copy of the album entitled `` The Dark Side of the Moon ' ' by the band Pink Floyd .
I am not , of course , a big fan of rock music .
I am not a fan of its lyrics and its culture , but I think this piece of art by itself makes this very important point as ideal with this compromise legislation before
us .
As we can see , there is a beam of white light on the left side of the triangular prism .
On the right side , the beam of light is very fractured and multishades .
At the end of the day , we will have an alternative minimum tax fix , we will have extenders , and we will have an energy and disaster relief package that is a compromise .
That is the white light on the left side .
Republicans will see that the compromise meets their principles .
Let 's say Republicans see the red light on the right .
The offsets are good policy .
From a Republican standpoint , there is enough new policy in the energy part of the deal to tie the nonenergy offsets ; otherwise , energy incentives are reformed .
That is our way of looking at this within the policy I annunciated a year ago .
Republicans can see that the biggest item in the bill , the alternative minimum tax , is not offset .
That preserves our point that the unfair alternative minimum tax -- hitting 23
million middle - class Americans if we do n't fix it -- should not be a reason to raise taxes on other taxpayers .
Likewise , there is enough new and modified policy to tie to the offshore deferred compensation revenue .
The bottom line is that the leaders were able to secure a longer term extension of current policy , as well as with the revenue .
Democrats are able to see the offset policy from their standpoint .
That is the blue strand of light on the right side of the prism .
Democrats wanted significant revenue raisers , and they got them .
Both sides wanted the underlying revenue - losing extensions and new policy .
Most prisms are delicate .
They are transitory .
This one is no different .
Our friends in the House need to see that .
They can break this fragile prism .
The shards will cut millions of taxpaying families .
This deal defers the very vital debate between Republicans and Democrats on whether we tax our way out of this fiscal situation -- the Democratic view - - or contrariwise , do we restrain spending .
That is the Republican view .
That is a very important debate which has held us up for so very long .
That very important debate is deferred to another day .
Each side holds to its principles .
Each side does the people 's business .
I thank Chairman Baucus and both leaders for getting us to this point of compromise where each of us can have some victories .
But for me , it is preserving the very basic policies of the Republican caucus .
Using the prism that presents the opportunity to preserve tax relief for millions of middle - income families , I ask that we pass this compromise .
Madam President , one of the amendments we will be voting on today is the energy tax extenders bill that I just told you I would refer to in detail , and here it is .
I once heard a man say he always went everywhere with his wife because he never wanted to kiss her goodbye .
Our dependence on foreign oil is very similar .
As Americans , we know our dependence on foreign oil is not pretty but have not found a way to kiss that dependence goodbye .
We need to enact commonsense , bipartisan laws , such as this energy tax extenders amendment that we will be voting on , the first vote midafternoon .
It will help America move toward ending its dependence on foreign oil .
We are almost three - quarters of the way through this year , 2008 .
Since January 1 of this year , a number of energy tax relief provisions have already expired .
In addition , a number of energy tax provisions are set to expire in just 3 months .
For example , section 45 , production tax credit for energy production for wind and refined coal , is extended through the year 2009 .
Importantly , the wind production tax credit does not have the harmful 35 - percent cap that the House Democratic leadership wants to place on it .
Another provision contained in this amendment is a new credit for electric plug - in vehicles .
Consumers who purchase an electric plug - in -- and it has to be a passenger vehicle - - can get up to a $ 7,500 tax credit .
If Americans are using electricity instead of gas to power their cars , it is a step toward reducing our dependence on foreign oil , much as ethanol has reduced our dependence on foreign oil for use in our cars by at least 5 percent .
Included in this amendment is a provision to reduce the tax on idling reduction units .
These units are designed to eliminate the need for a big rig to idle to provide heating , air - conditioning , and electricity when it is stopped .
That brings me to the fact that we are saving diesel in big Mack trucks because they do n't idle because we have this incentive for the separate unit to keep the cab cool while people are sleeping .
It irritates me then , when I look back to this summer -- and maybe even right now for all I know -- when I saw Government officials using their chauffeured SUVs which were idling outside our office buildings wasting a great deal of fuel .
As Members of Congress , we should be setting a good example for the American people by conserving fuel and not wasting it .
For instance , I have a Ford Taurus .
You do n't see it idling outside my home or outside of wherever I am momentarily stopped .
You surely would not see my driver in it because I do n't have one .
If you do see anyone else driving my Taurus , please call the police because someone has stolen my car .
I would like to refer to Ashton Kutcher , from Cedar Rapids , IA , saying : ``Dude ,
Where 's my car ? ''
So far , the Senate has not passed these popular expiring and expired energy tax extender provisions .
However , the Senate has now reached a bipartisan agreement that should enable us to pass this first amendment that we will be voting on midafternoon .
This first amendment contains these popular energy tax extender provisions -- many beyond what I have already talked about -- as well as revenue offsets for these provisions .
My fellow Republicans were divided on whether energy should be offset .
Some opposed any tax increase on oil and gas .
Others , such as this Senator , looked to convert conventional energy tax incentives into incentives for alternative energy and conservation .
On the other hand , almost all Democrats were in this ``conversion '' camp .
I kind of [ Page : S9237 ]
feel myself like we have had a lot of incentives for old - time fossil fuels ; that those industries are developed ,
and it is okay to move that money from that source over to alternative energy - - a new industry that we are in the middle of developing and , in the case of ethanol , for a long time have been developing .
We compromised between Republicans and Democrats by cutting back the following oil and gas tax incentives , which totaled roughly $ 9 billion .
First , we froze the manufacturing deduction for all oil and gas production at 6 percent .
We reformed the use of the foreign tax credit for major oil companies .
This offset is very important to get done .
Finally , we raised the cap on funding for the oil spill trust fund .
To reach the $ 17 billion target for fully offsetting this energy tax package , we used a couple of nonoil and gas offsets totaling roughly $ 8 billion .
First , we included the Bush administration 's ``tax gap '' proposal to have securities firms report the cost of stock purchases and sales to the Internal Revenue Service .
Secondly , we extended the unemployment surtax .
In keeping with the principle that tax offsets should make good policy sense and should be used to pay for new tax policy , we used these $ 8 billion in nonoil and gas offsets to pay at least $ 8 billion in new energy tax policy because it is a Republican program that if you have new tax policy , it should be offset .
Our objection is to offsetting existing tax policy that might sunset ; that you want to extend it in the same way it has been functioning for the last several years .
So the bottom line of this is that both sides compromised .
Democrats yielded on unoffset popular current law tax relief -- AMT as an example -- and Republicans agreed to offsets that were good tax policy .
But we ensured that our principle that major current law tax relief , such as the alternative minimum tax fix , should not be conditioned on other tax increases .
It is important to note that if we do n't do more to encourage alternative energy , we might one day run out of oil and end up having to drive the alternative vehicles , such as Fred Flintstone , as you recall from the cartoon on television .
So I urge a ``yes '' vote on this first amendment that we will be voting on midafternoon , and I hope we can get this bipartisan agreement through and get it to the House of Representatives because we only have a little time left before we adjourn for the elections .
I yield the floor , and as I do n't see any other Member who wants to speak , I suggest the absence of a quorum , and I ask unanimous consent , Madam President , before you call the roll , to divide the time that lapses in the quorum call between the two sides .

I have n't had a chance to post about the Billo / Levin War until now .
This whole bail out mess has really upset the equilibrium everywhere .
Bill O'Reilly ( audio ) actually attacked his fellow right wing talk show hosts for being against the bail out .
" It gets me angry , " said O'Reilly .
" I do talk radio and most talk radio is conservative - dominated ideologues ; Kool - Aid drinking idiots .
Idiots .
Screaming at you that this is socialism , this is this , this is that .
‘ It 's Clinton 's fault . '
It 's Clinton 's fault ?
He has n't been in office in 8 years .
It 's Bush 's fault !
It happened under Bush 's watch . "
But then O'Reilly 's tirade seemed to aim at Rush Limbaugh - without actually naming him .
" But let 's get back to this talk radio stuff , " said O'Reilly .
" These idiots .
I mean , they 're misleading you .
They 're lying to you .
They 're rich , these guys .
Big cigars .
All of that .
‘ Yeah , oh yeah , my private jet ! '
And they 're saying , ‘ Oh , no !
No bail out !'
Uh , uh , no way !
" Hey !
You 're going to get it , not them ! "
O'Reilly continued .
" That foreign investment pulls out , we are toast !
And they 'll pull out if this bailout does n't happen .
Are you getting the message here ?
Walk away from these liars , these right - wing liars .
Walk away from them !
They 're not looking out for you . "
Mark Levin did n't like that one bit and actually brought up BillO 's sexual harassment suit .

McCain blamed as US economic rescue deal staggers Agence France - Presse
Published : Thursday September 25 , 2008

WASHINGTON ( AFP ) - Top Democrats angrily accused Republican White House contender John McCain late Thursday of sabotaging an astronomically expensive deal to bail out Wall Street and shore up the US economy .
The 700 - billion - dollar package stalled at talks convened by President George W. Bush with top lawmakers and both the men vying to succeed him -- McCain and Democrat Barack Obama .
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid announced a new round of late - night discussions Thursday in a bid to get the deal back on track , set to be joined by Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and Federal Reserve chief Ben Bernanke .
" John McCain did nothing to help , he only hurt the process , " the senior Democrat said at a joint news conference with Senate banking committee chairman Christopher Dodd .
Barney Frank , the Democratic chair of the House of Representatives financial services committee , said : " I think this was a campaign ploy for Senator McCain .
" I think they then had the problem that there might not have been enough of a deadlock for him to resolve , " he said , after Dodd had earlier announced an in - principle agreement with some senior Republicans on the bailout package .
The meeting convened by Bush was a " photo op and political theater that had nothing to do with us getting to work , " Dodd said .
But backed by Richard Shelby , the top Republican on Dodd 's Senate committee , McCain said " there never was a deal " given the hostility of many congressional Republicans to the government 's planned intrusion into private enterprise .
" I 'm very hopeful that we 're making progress , and I know we 're making progress , " the Arizona senator said in an ABC News interview , as both he and Obama announced they were staying in Washington Thursday night .
McCain had said he was putting his campaign on hold and rushing back to Washington to take part in the crisis talks .
He also called for Friday 's first presidential debate at the University of Mississippi to be postponed .
Obama again rejected that call , arguing it was more important than ever for the two contenders in the November 4 election to lay out their case to the American people .
" One of us is going to be in charge of this mess in four months , and the American people I think have a right and obligation to find out where we want to take the country and what we believe , " the Illinois senator said .
" Senator McCain has no reason to be fearful about this debate .
And so , my hope is that the debate goes forward . "
McCain told ABC he was " very hopeful " that a deal in Washington could be struck in time for the debate in Oxford , Mississippi to proceed .
Obama , however , said there was no reason why they could not juggle both balls .
" When we inject presidential politics into delicate negotiations , it 's not necessarily as helpful as it needs to be , " the Democrat added .
In the face of the financial tumult , polls had showed Obama opening up a wide lead over McCain but new surveys Thursday by Gallup and Zogby had the rivals level - pegging again .
The rescue deal was proposed by Paulson after a raft of government bailouts and failures on Wall Street .
In a televised address to the nation Wednesday , Bush warned financial disaster was at hand without quick action from Congress .
Earlier , Dodd had emerged from talks on Capitol Hill with some top Republicans and Democrats to announce " a fundamental agreement on a set of principles " to rescue Wall Street .
" It was a very productive meeting , " agreed Republican Senator Bob Bennett , a senior member of Dodd 's committee , prematurely anticipating a rapid agreement by both parties in Congress .
Democratic additions to the bailout include leniency for struggling mortgage holders over their repayment terms , and would give taxpayers " equity " in a bailed out company , entitling them to a share of any profits generated .
Democrats were also calling for limits on pay deals for executives whose companies get rescued under the government deal .
And they said that any deal must include strict oversight by federal regulators .
But many Republicans , even prior to McCain 's intercession , were openly unhappy with the Bush administration for the apparent carte blanche Paulson would wield over the titanic financial services industry .
Old technology could get a new lease on life as fuel prices skyrocket .
In the late 1990s , researchers at Georgia Tech Research Institute began drawing from 1980s aerospace technology to develop several diesel - saving aerodynamic tricks for 18 - wheelers .
Their results were announced in 2005 .
Back then , however , diesel was cheap so the tricks never became part of the trade .
Today , the leader of all that research said the trucking companies are calling him .
" The dramatic increase in diesel prices has led the trucking industry to reconsider aerodynamic fuel efficiency improvements that might not have been cost effective only a few years ago , " said Georgia Tech 's Robert Englar .
" Though there are technical challenges ahead , we believe our techniques for improving fuel efficiency offer significant potential to reduce the impact of these fuel cost increases .
Beyond the trucking industry , that would help consumers who see the effects of fuel costs in everything they buy . "
What a drag
Englar 's team , with support from the U.S. Department of Energy , came up with several simple solutions to reduce aerodynamic drag and improve fuel efficiency by 8 to 12 percent in the heavy trucks .
All told , the tricks could save between 1.6 billion and 2.4 billion gallons of fuel per year , they estimate .
The focus was on trailers .
While trucks already have fairings and other streamlining parts , little has been done to address drag on trailers , the researchers say .
Englar and colleagues developed pneumatic devices that blow air from slots at the rear of the trailers .
The jets smooth the flow of air to eliminate bad things such as air - flow separation , vorticity and suction on the aft doors .
Other improvements include rounding aft trailer corners and installing fairings around wheels .
Englar said that lately he has received numerous inquiries from trucking companies large and small as well as from railroads .
Ongoing research
The research has continued , using wind tunnels and drawing on studies of military jets done in the 1980s .
The scientists also run real trucks for 45 miles at highway speeds on a test track to gauge fuel savings .
Aerodynamic drag can be cut by up to 31 percent , they found .
" Aerodynamically , we have resolved unknowns raised in earlier testing , and the next step is to get this into a fleet of trucks for more extensive testing , " Englar said .
" At highway speeds , each one percent improvement in fuel economy would result in saving about 200 million gallons of fuel for the U.S. heavy truck fleet . "
Englar still needs to figure out a more efficient air compressor setup to run the pneumatic system .
An interesting added benefit :
The pneumatic system can also act like brakes .
" The pneumatic systems can turn a low - drag configuration into a high - drag configuration very rapidly , providing a lot more braking power , " Englar said .
" By turning the trailer into a non-moving pneumatic rudder , blowing can also restore directional stability should the truck be operating in destabilizing high side winds . "

The rotating blade produce a pressure drop that can harm bats Bats are at risk from wind turbines , researchers have found , because the rotating blades produce a change in air pressure that can kill the mammals .
Canadian scientists examined bats found dead at a wind farm , and concluded that most had internal injuries consistent with sudden loss of air pressure .
Bats use echo- location to avoid hitting the blades but cannot detect the sharp pressure changes around the turbine .
The scientists say wind farms are more of an issue for bats than for birds .
" An atmospheric pressure drop at wind turbine blades is an undetectable - and potentially unforseeable - hazard for bats , thus partially explaining the large number of bat fatalities at these specific structures , " said Erin Baerwald , who led the research team at the University of Calgary .
Route cause
Bat deaths around wind farms have been widely documented across Europe and North America .
Two years ago , EU nations formally agreed to make developers aware of the risks , and find ways of monitoring bat migration routes .
Earlier this year , a bid to build a wind farm near Bideford in north Devon was turned down because of the potential impact on the mammals .
Research is underway to find ways of scaring bats from wind farms
But among all this , understanding of how turbines affect bats has been lacking .
The Calgary team collected carcasses of hoary and silver - haired bats killed at a wind farm in south - western Alberta .
Examinations showed that fewer than half had external injuries that could have been caused by collision .
But about 90 % had internal haemorrhaging , most notably in the chest cavity , a condition that puts pressure on the lung and can be fatal .
The idea is that the pressure around a rotating turbine blade is lower than in the surrounding air .
A bat flying into the low - pressure zone finds its lungs suddenly expanding , bursting capillaries in the surrounding tissue which then becomes flooded with blood .
Birds , which have more rigid and robust lungs , do not undergo the same trauma from a sudden drop in pressure .
" Given that bats are far more susceptible to barotrauma than birds , and that bat fatalities at wind turbines far outnumber bird fatalities at most sites , wildlife fatalities at wind turbines are now a bat issue , not a bird issue , " said Ms Baerwald .
Some research groups are investigating ways to keep bats away from wind farms , and a University of Aberdeen group recently suggested radar emissions might act as a " bat - scarer " .
The new research is reported in the journal Current Biology .

What are these ?
Two commercial airline pilots who fell asleep in the cockpit and overshot their landing by 15 miles have been cleared to return to work .
Earlier this year , the Go! flight from Honolulu to Hilo cruised over its landing target at 21,000 feet .
Alarmed air traffic controllers tried to contact the cockpit a dozen times but got no response for 17 minutes .
The pilots were subsequently fired , but suspensions issued by the US aviation watchdog have now been served .
Officials feared for the safety of the 40 passengers on board when they got no response from the Hawaiian carrier 's short - haul Flight 1002 on 13 February .
Some 44 minutes into what should have been a 45 - minute flight , contact was finally established and the plane was ordered to return to land .
Sleep disorder
The US National Transportation Safety Board ruled in June that both pilots " unintentionally fell asleep " .
Captain Scott Oltman was suspended for 60 days by the the US Federal Aviation Authority ( FAA ) for careless and reckless operation of an aircraft and for failing to maintain radio communications .
The FAA suspended First Officer Dillon Shepley for 45 days for careless and reckless operation of a plane .
Both suspensions were completed on 9 September , the FAA said .
After February 's incident , Mr Oltman was diagnosed with " severe obstructive sleep apnea " which causes people to stop breathing repeatedly in their sleep , preventing a restful night .
No action was taken against the carrier because it was deemed to have acted within guidelines and had offered the two pilots sufficient rest - time between flights .
It might be time for the phrase : ' We 're gonna need a bigger boat ' to enter retirement .
For this mighty passenger ship dwarfs all that stands next to it , making the thousands of spectators which came to see it 's launch look little more than ants as they waved the graceful ship out of the port .
The 315 m - long ship is so wide it barely squeezed out of the Papenberg watergates , but ably helped by two tug - boats it escaped on it's to the North sea , where it will head to Denmark .
People watch the cruiser ' Celebrity Solstice ' dragged through the watergate of the Meyer Dockyard in Papenburg
She is one of five Solstice ships launching between now and 2012 , and can carry nearly 3,000 passengers .
And , after thousands of years , landlubbers might be able to escape their phobia of the sea ...
This cruiser is the first one to boast an authentic grass lawn on its top deck .
Celebrity Solstice is the most widely heralded ship to enter the cruise industry this year
The ship is ' virtually complete ' - 98 per cent , to be exact - and is on track for it 's November debut , when it will begin life as a U.S. cruise ship .

CHICAGO -- Waves of Slovenians , Bohemians , Irish , Italians and others have crested and receded , and today the Pilsen neighborhood of this polyglot city is a heartland Ellis Island , a port of entry for Mexican immigrants .
There is a neighborhood school to teach their children important things -- math and history , of course , but also how to navigate a revolving door , how to behave in an elevator , and how to identify the salad fork and the soupspoon .
From Cristo Rey Jesuit High School you can see the Sears Tower to the north , where some students work .
All the students work somewhere -- at more than 100 companies and law firms -- one day a week , at jobs paying $ 20 an hour , the money going directly to the school , covering 70 percent of its costs .
To work in the Sears Tower , a student must pass through something perhaps not encountered in his or her family 's Mexican village or in Pilsen -- a revolving door -- and might have to change elevators en route to the Tower 's upper floors .
Before going to work , many of the school 's 14 - year - old ninth - graders , like their parents , have never been downtown .
The summer before beginning at CRJHS , ninth - graders go to a behavioral boot camp where they get what David Whitman calls " a dose of cultural imperialism " to inculcate bourgeoisie values , from personal hygiene to table manners .
The school believes that some Latino traditions should be tempered : Many of the students had been raised to show respect by speaking quietly and avoiding eye contact while softly shaking hands .
That is not how things are done downtown in the city of broad shoulders .
Before long , the children are introducing themselves with firm handshakes , and are introducing their parents to the Loop .
Cristo Rey is one of six " no excuses " schools around the nation that Whitman examined in a new book , " Sweating the Small Stuff : Inner - City Schools and the New Paternalism . "
James Gartland , SJ , now CRJHS ' president , was back in America on a break from his work in Peru when he was assigned to walk Pilsen 's streets and discover how the church might serve .
He asked people " What do you dream ? " and " Why did you leave Mexico ? "
The answers pointed to what CRJHS has become .
It began in 1996 with 79 students meeting in the four corners of a roller - skating rink .
Today the 540 students -- most from two - parent families with an average of five members and an income of $ 38,000 -- enjoy an old parish school , refurbished and expanded .
About one - third of those admitted to the ninth grade do not graduate , half because they cannot cope academically , others because they chafe under CRJHS ' three hours of homework a night and its strict dress and discipline codes .
The school exists to nurture a culture of achievement for children with no other option for college preparation , including those who in public schools might be diverted onto a vocational track .
It is not skimming off the cream of the crop of local students ; it rejects any who can get accepted by , and afford , other Catholic schools .
Some especially promising students are directed to Catholic schools that offer scholarships .
Which makes CRJHS ' college placement rate especially remarkable :
In the last seven years , 99 percent of graduates have been accepted to at least one college , 75 percent of them four - year institutions .
CRJHS can have its work program , its entirely college preparatory courses ( " the old , dead white man 's curriculum , " says an English teacher cheerfully ) , its zero tolerance of disorder ( from gang symbols down to chewing gum ) , its enforcement of decorum ( couples dancing suggestively are told to " leave some space there for the Holy Spirit " ) and its requirement that every family pay something , if only as little as $ 25 a month -- it can have all this because it is not shackled by bureaucracy or unions , as public schools are .
The " Cristo Rey model " is as American as another Chicago - area startup , McDonalds .
And like McDonalds , the first of which was in suburban Des Plaines , the model is being replicated .
The Cristo Rey Network now has 22 schools around the country , with four more coming by 2010 .
People , communities and countries often make costly mistakes because they do n't know what it is that they do n't know .
But regarding the education of inner city minorities , America 's problem is that it does n't know what a few Americans , such as those who have created the Cristo Rey model , do know .

California bans text messaging while driving SACRAMENTO Governor signs law restricting motorists , plus bills on charter schools , business with Sudan

Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger began signing bills into law on Wednesday , starting with legislation that bans text messaging while driving and another that forbids companies that do business with the state from having investments in Sudan .
Schwarzenegger , who also signed two other measures regarding charter schools while vetoing a third , still has 870 bills that he would need to either sign into law or veto by Tuesday .
If he takes no action , those bills automatically become law without his signature .
The governor got a late start on the bills because last month he threatened to veto all legislation until lawmakers approved the overdue state budget .
The Legislature responded by holding the bills until they and the governor had agreed on a budget deal late last week .
The Legislature approved the spending plan on Friday and Schwarzenegger signed it on Tuesday , paving the way for the governor to act on hundreds of items .
The first bill , SB28 by Sen.
Joe Simitian , D - Palo Alto , will make California one of a handful of states that bans text messaging while driving .
Others include Louisiana , Minnesota , New Jersey , Connecticut and Washington .
" Banning electronic text messaging while driving will keep drivers ' hands on the wheel and their eyes on the road , making our roadways a safer place for all Californians , " Schwarzenegger said in a written statement .
But a Republican lawmaker argued the measure is yet another example of adding unnecessary legislation to the Vehicle Code when there 's already sufficient rules on the books .
" There 's already blanket law that says reckless driving is illegal and if you cause an accident while recklessly driving , it 's a misdemeanor ... When you start going down that path , where do you end ? " said Assemblyman Chuck DeVore , R - Irvine .
The legislation follows California 's ban on using a cell phone while driving unless motorists use a hands - free device .
That law , also authored by Simitian , went into effect July 1 .
" It is a reminder that we live in a changing world and the law has to change to reflect that fact , " Simitian said .
The text - messaging ban will go into effect on Jan.
1 . A violation of the law would result in a $ 20 fine for a first offense and $ 50 for each subsequent offense .
The Republican governor also signed AB498 , which forbids private companies that have business operations in Sudan to bid on state contracts - a way to pressure the Sudanese government to halt the genocide in Darfur .
" California will not underwrite the horrors of murder and genocide in Sudan , " Schwarzenegger said in a written statement .
Sarah Grundahl , domestic policy associate for Save Darfur Coalition based in Washington , D.C. , applauded Schwarzenegger signing the bill into law .
" Economic pressure is one of the biggest tools that we have and California has stood up and made it clear that we do n't help fund genocide , " she said .
California already forbids the state 's pension funds from investing in companies that have active business in Sudan and Iran .
The governor on Wednesday also signed two bills on charter schools .
They are :
-- SB658 ( Romero , D - Los Angeles ) - Shifts the Year - Round School Grant Program funds , which total more than $ 90 million , to the Charter School Facility Grant Program beginning July 1 , 2013 .
-- AB2033 ( Núñez , D - Los Angeles ) - Lowers the interest rate for lease payments on approved charter school facility projects .
Schwarzenegger vetoed AB2115 , authored by Assemblyman Gene Mullin , D - South San Francisco , which would have required charter schools to adopt conflict - of - interest policies for their governing boards similar to the ones used by local school boards .
Schwarzenegger argued in his veto message that AB2115 would create additional costs for charter schools and would run counter to the intent of charter schools , which is to be free from rules governing local school districts .
Sure , stocks surged today .
But how long can that last ?
And with rumors of holds being placed on simple deposits are scaring some .
Are you worried ?
Have you come across a drained ATM like the one above ?
Is all you money stuffed into your mattress ?
Call it an act of faith or call it a political ploy , but 33 ministers plan to endorse a presidential candidate from their Sunday pulpits in defiance of federal law .

Hill Dems , McCain and Obama want limits , but Treasury says it would discourage companies from participating .
CEO pay emerges as bailout barrier
Flying in the face of Congress and both presidential campaigns , Treasury is resisting efforts to impose pay limits on Wall Street executives and bankers whose companies stand to be helped by the government ’s $ 700 billion rescue plan for the financial markets .
As markets reopen Monday , the issue is a surprising flash point between Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and House Democrats , who have drafted a bill giving Paulson much of what he wants but requiring that Treasury also demand “ appropriate standards for executive compensation . ”

Treasury argues that such requirements would make it harder to persuade companies to sell their troubled assets to the government .
But Democrats , who otherwise admire Paulson , say that the former Goldman Sachs chairman is blind to the politics of the situation and the huge divide between the average taxpayer and the financial world now seeking relief from bad debts that have clogged the credit system — and that threaten the entire economy .
A senior aide to John McCain , the Republican presidential nominee , told Politico on Sunday that the Arizona senator also favored compensation limits as part of the package , as does the Democratic nominee , Barack Obama , according to a campaign spokesman for the Illinois senator .
The House Financial Services Committee , which shared portions of its bill with Treasury on Sunday , still expects to move ahead with floor action later this week .
And the outcome could be influenced by how the administration reacts to a second Democratic priority : a year - end spending bill that includes more than $ 36 billion in emergency appropriations to finance disaster aid , fuel assistance for the poor and loans for the auto industry .
As now drafted , the stopgap bill would cover most domestic agencies through March 6 while giving full - year funding to the Departments of Veterans Affairs , Homeland Security and possibly Defense .
The two largest pieces of the emergency money are about $ 24 billion in disaster assistance and $ 7.5 billion to finance $ 25 billion in direct loans to help the Big Three automakers retool plants to produce more energy - efficient vehicles .
Democrats are hoping for some give by the White House budget office in return for their support of the much larger Treasury package .
But leaders in both parties are worried by defections on the left and right , and the path for Treasury through the Senate could take longer .
In the House , Paulson benefits from his close working ties with Rep. Barney Frank ( D - Mass , ) chairman of the Financial Services panel .
But relations have never been as good with Alabama Sen .
Richard Shelby , the ranking Republican on the Senate Banking Committee , making it harder for Banking Chairman Christopher Dodd ( D - Conn . ) .
In a statement made available Sunday night , the Alabama Republican ’s office said : “ Sen .
Shelby remains at this point unconvinced that Treasury ’s proposal strikes a balance between the interests of the taxpayer and the economy .
He has concerns regarding the efficacy of the plan , and whether it would reward Wall Street while doing nothing for homeowners or for local financial institutions that are also a key segment of our economy .
He will continue to work with Chairman Dodd to see whether there is a way forward . ”
As a Wall Street veteran , Paulson admits his own anger at the situation taxpayers have been forced into by the debt crisis , which was triggered by the collapse of housing prices but also a history of reckless practices by major investment banks .
But the secretary says he wants to avoid “ punitive ” steps even as he presses Congress for quick action on the massive government intervention .
Given Paulson ’s urgency , Democrats have been more surprised that the executive compensation language has been such an issue .
Neither Frank nor Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - Calif . ) shows any sign of backing down .
“ Democrats believe a responsible solution should include independent oversight , protections for homeowners and constraints on excessive executive compensation , ” Pelosi said in a statement late Sunday .
" We will not simply hand over a $ 700 billion blank check to Wall Street and hope for a better outcome .
Democrats will act responsibly to insulate Main Street from Wall Street . ”
Language forwarded to Treasury on Sunday by Frank ’s panel would block future executive bonuses paid to encourage risky investments and also attempts to recapture via a “ claw back ” provision — any incentives paid in the past based on “ earnings , gains or other criteria ” that proved to be false .
Paulson is given some discretion to judge what is deemed “ inappropriate or excessive . ”
And in the case of severance pay and golden parachutes , the bill imposes no dollar ceiling ; instead , the secretary would be charged with setting limits “ as determined to be appropriate in the public interest in light of the assistance being given to the entity . ”
Apart from executive pay , the two major demands by Democrats are greater oversight of how the $ 700 billion is used and some certainty that the government will use its new leverage in the mortgage market to help homeowners facing foreclosure .
Frank ’s draft bill would have the comptroller general establish “ a permanent presence ” in the offices of the Treasury - run program .
And the Government Accountability Office “ shall be afforded full facilities for verifying transactions and retain copies of such books , accounts , and other records ” as it deems appropriate .
To mitigate foreclosures , the Treasury would be required to use its new investment powers to “ maximize assistance to the underlying mortgagors ” and also coordinate with federal banking and housing agencies toward the same goal .
The assumption is that , as Treasury buys up more troubled mortgage related assets , it will have more power “ to encourage the servicers of the underlying mortgages ” to write down the debts and thereby allow homeowners to find government - insured refinancing through the Federal Housing Administration .
Appearing on ABC ’s “ This Week with George Stephanopoulos ” Sunday , House Republican Leader John A. Boehner of Ohio said , “ This is not a time for ideological purity . ”
But both parties can’t ignore defections on the edges .
Conservatives loathe the $ 700 - billion price tag .
Liberals resent the call to rescue Wall Street from its own excess .
And neither side wants to transform private risk into taxpayer debt .
Opposition over the weekend came from Sen. Bernie Sanders , a Vermont independent on the left , and prominent conservatives like Rep. Mike Pence ( R - Ind . ) and former Speaker Newt Gingrich .
“ Congress had better ask a lot of questions before it shifts this much burden to the taxpayer and shifts this much power to a Washington bureaucracy , ” Gingrich wrote in an essay posted on the National Review website .
Pence ’s stand is important given his status as potential future leader — and Boehner rival — in the Republican caucus .
When asked about Pence , Boehner said , " If this were about a company here or there failing , I would n't be for intervening in any way shape or form .
This is about our way of life , our society , our economy .
...
This is n't about Wall Street . "
But later a Boehner aide pointed out that he had n’t yet committed to the House bill until he sees the full package demanded by Democrats .
In a statement released past midnight Monday morning , the Ohio Republican urged Democrats to have their final plan up on the Internet at least 24 hours before House action , and looking forward , Boehner suggested a new Joint Select Committee be created in Congress to oversee the intervention .
TEHRAN ( Press TV ) --
The Pakistani Army has been given orders to retaliate against any unilateral strike by the Afghanistan - based U.S. troops inside the country .
Army Spokesman Maj Gen Athar Abbas confirmed the orders in a brief interview with Geo News on late Thursday night .
The decision was made on the first day of the two - day meeting of Pakistan 's top military commanders to discuss the U.S. coalition 's ground and air assault in Waziristan region which killed dozens of civilians .
Army Chief General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani chaired the meeting which began in Rawalpindi on Thursday at the Army General Headquarters .
Pakistan 's military commanders expressed their determination to defend the country 's borders without allowing any external forces to conduct operations inside the tribal belt bordering Afghanistan , sources said .
A senior official said the military commanders also discussed the implications of the American attacks inside Pakistan and took stock of the public feeling .
“ In his statement , Genral Kayani has represented the feeling of the entire nation , as random attacks inside Pakistan have angered each and every Pakistani , ” he said .
Earlier on Wednesday , Kayani rebuffed the American policy of including Pakistani territory in their operations against the al - Qaeda and Taliban linked militants hiding in the areas near Afghan border .
Also , Prime Minister Syed Yousuf Raza Gilani noted that Kayani 's remarks on country 's defense were true reflection of the government policy .
The army decision followed bloody incursions by the U.S. ground troops into tribal belt as well as a string of missile strikes by CIA - operated drone aircraft .
The reaction also comes after U.S. President George W. Bush approved U.S. military raids on militants inside Pakistan without Islamabad 's agreement .
The development also brought into the open the increasing mistrust between the Americans and the Pakistanis over how to handle the Taliban and al - Qaeda linked militants in Pakistan 's tribal areas .
Some political expert predict the break out of an all - out war between the United States troops and Pakistani army following the Bush administration 's approval of ground and air assaults inside the country .

I suspect he 's got a " legal " claim to over - ride the Constitution ( which requires said elections ) for anything he damned well pleases at this point .
Not a legit " legal " claim , mind you , but one he 's issued and would order both his politicized DoJ and the Dept. of Defense to enforce .
Whether the latter would do it , of course , is another issue entirely .
But sure , he can do anything now that the bar has been so lowered , without objection , from the U.S. Congress or any other body that might have stopped him previously .

They 've probably been planning this a long , long time .
Former Republican Governor Ernie Fletcher of Kentucky raised eyebrows while purchasing tons of body armor for police officers several years ago .
He was getting plenty of grants , and one was Kellogg Foundation .
I 'm not sure whether it was for the body armor .
Does Bush / Cheney mission - accomplished mean to collapse the financial system , provoke unrest , rage and despair , and then deploy the military to turn against and kill their own people ?
These people in Washington DC seem so greedy , corrupt , and blood - thirsty .
Ask one of them to show you the DoD budget which has never , ever been balanced .
It 's a bottomless pit , and they can do anything they want there .
Just ask to see it !
Now , where are the terrorists ?
And who are we supposed to be afraid of ?
Nobody trusts anybody anymore in this country .
These so - called leaders have ripped our homeland to pieces while destroying any hope of global respect or admiration .
Who will have to deal with this mess ?
Obama or Nader ?
Or some delusional Republican ?

This is absolutely the worst thing I 've heard from the Administration yet !
I suppose since their power comes from illegal elections , they do n't feel there is any need to follow the Constitution .
" No standing army . "
Was that in there ?
Did it mean that no army is deployed on our soil ?
That 's how I remember it from Civics class 35 years ago .
This sounds like Mexico or some other banana republic .
Civil unrest ?
Crowd control ???
Does anybody have a country they recomend where we can live ?

does anyone know more about this ?

268 emails in the course of 24 hours .
WHOA .
There 's the guy who asked if I can wear rainboots while we get it on ( ??? ) , the guy who is old enough to be my dad and sent me a picture of himself in leather assless chaps ( I double - checked to make sure I did n't post in M4 M by accident after that ) , and the desperate 19 year - old who is a virgin but thinks I 'd be " perfect " for his first time .
I am re-thinking my decision not to go to the bars this weekend .
No no , I must be strong , keep the faith .
I feel that dick is not far away , I must persist .
I pick you .
You look relatively normal .
Your email was funny , not too long , not generic .
I toss my fate into the wind and see where it will take me .
We exchange pictures .
I wonder if that picture of your dick was taken at that angle to make it look bigger ?
Hmm .
Yeah , that picture of me ?
Well , I sifted through the 200 most recent photos of me and picked the most flattering one .
Heh .
We meet up .
You look about 5 years older than you do in your picture .
That 's okay , because I weigh about 10 pounds more now than I did in that picture I sent .
But hey , guess what ?
I 'm wearing sexy lingerie .
And you 're a man , with a penis , I 've already screened you , spent two days trading witty emails back and forth with you , and goddammit , I 'm gonna fuck you .
That 's just how it is .
I 'm too horny to go back now .
After a couple of drinks , it 's clear that it 's time to do something next .
Because it 's not polite to tell someone you want their dick inside of you as soon as possible , when you suggest we head to dinner , I agree .
This feels like a date .
I did n't want a date .
I want sex .
Okay , pseudo - date continues .
Fine .
I still want your dick in me , as soon as possible .
We head back to my place .
FINALLY .
We make out for a little bit .
Did you forget to shave this morning ?
That " soul patch " you have ?
First of all , it 's really circa 1992 .
Secondly , it 's giving me stubble - burn .
I 'm going to have a stupid - ass looking soul patch stubble burn mark tomorrow .
Fuck .
I keep kissing you because like I said , I want your dick inside of me as soon as possible .
Ha ha , you 're wearing " Vote for Pedro " boxers .
I forgive you for the soul patch .
Actually , I think " Pedro " might be voting for me right now :)
Okay , this is n't going so bad .
You ask if I want some oral .
UH , HELLO ?
WTF are you asking that for ?
Did I or did I not post in casual encounters ?
No actually , I do n't like orgasms .
Tongues should only be used for useful things , like ice cream and tying knots in cherry stems .
Oh crap .
Now I understand why you asked .
You have NO IDEA what you are doing .
You plunge in face first , like my special lady bits are a snorkling mask , and if you do n't get as much of your face in there as possible you just might die of hypoxia .
Now , while I appreciate your enthusiasm , I will need my vagina back in good working order later .
Thank you .
That 's enough .
You slip on a condom , and start the old " hump and grunt . "
You hump .
You grunt .
I 'm not sure , but my bed might have just become a time machine , and I think we 're back in 1998 , because this is how boys fucked in high school .
How old are you again ?
I start thinking about going to the store tomorrow .
I think I 'm out of cereal .
Should I get some more of those pasta things ?
Maybe I 'll try the pesto kind this time .
The hump and grunt continues .
What ?
You 're about to cum ?
That 's nice .
Thanks for letting me know .
Go right ahead .
I 'm glad at least you had fun .
You pass out afterwards , and start to snore .
I lie there , thinking .
I 'm totaling up my investment on this little CE situation we have going here : box of condoms , the good kind : $ 13 sexy new sweater that I wore : $ 39 cost of the load of laundry that I will do tomorrow , after your hairy ass gets out of my bed : $ 3.50 ... and , the non-monetary yet incredibly important contribution of my time , which could have been better spent , oh , I do n't know , washing my hair or prepping my tax return : roughly 7 hours ( three hours of email + four hours of pseudo date + bad sex ) ..... Learning why I should stop browsing casual encounters and just use my vibrator instead : PRICELESS .
PETER HITCHENS : How China has created a new slave empire in Africa
Narrow escape : Peter Hitchens
I think I am probably going to die any minute now .
An inflamed , deceived mob of about 50 desperate men are crowding round the car , some trying to turn it over , others beating at it with large rocks , all yelling insults and curses .
They have just started to smash the windows .
Next , they will pull us out and , well , let 's not think about that ...
I am trying not to meet their eyes , but they are staring at me and my companions with rage and hatred such as I have n't seen in a human face before .
Those companions , Barbara Jones and Richard van Ryneveld , are - like me - quite helpless in the back seats .
If we get out , we will certainly be beaten to death .
If we stay where we are , we will probably be beaten to death .
Our two African companions have - crazily in our view - got out of the car to try to reason with the crowd .
It is clear to us that you might as well preach non-violence to a tornado .
At last , after what must have been about 40 seconds but that felt like half an hour , one of the pair saw sense , leapt back into the car and reversed wildly down the rocky , dusty path - leaving his friend behind .
By the grace of God we did not slither into the ditch , roll over or burst a tyre .
Through the dust we churned up as we fled , we could see our would - be killers running with appalling speed to catch up .
There was just time to make a crazy two - point turn which allowed us to go forwards and so out - distance them .
We had pretty much abandoned our other guide to whatever his fate might be ( this was surprisingly easy to justify to myself at the time ) when we saw that he had broken free and was running with Olympic swiftness , just ahead of pursuers half hidden by the dust .
We flung open a rear door so he could scramble in and , engine grinding , we veered off , bouncing painfully over the ruts and rocks .
We feared there would be another barricade to stop our escape , and it would all begin again .
But there was n't , and we eventually realised we had got away , even the man whose idiocy nearly got us killed .
He told us it was us they wanted , not him , or he would never have escaped .
We ought to be dead .
We are not .
It is an interesting feeling , not wholly unpleasant .
Why did they want to kill us ?
What was the reason for their fury ?
They thought that if I reported on their way of life they might lose their livings .
Livings ?
Dyings , more likely .
Peking power : A Chinese supervisor cajoles local workers as they dig a trench in Kabwe , Zambia
These poor , hopeless , angry people exist by grubbing for scraps of cobalt and copper ore in the filth and dust of abandoned copper mines in Congo , sinking perilous 80 ft shafts by hand , washing their finds in cholera - infected streams full of human filth , then pushing enormous two - hundredweight loads uphill on ancient bicycles to the nearby town of Likasi where middlemen buy them to sell on , mainly to Chinese businessmen hungry for these vital metals .
To see them , as they plod miserably past , is to be reminded of pictures of unemployed miners in Thirties Britain , stumbling home in the drizzle with sacks of coal scraps gleaned from spoil heaps .
Except that here the unsparing heat makes the labour five times as hard , and the conditions of work and life are worse by far than any known in England since the 18th Century .
Many perish as their primitive mines collapse on them , or are horribly injured without hope of medical treatment .
Many are little more than children .
On a good day they may earn $ 3 , which just supports a meagre existence in diseased , malarial slums .
We had been earlier to this awful pit , which looked like a penal colony in an ancient slave empire .
Defeated , bowed figures toiled endlessly in dozens of hand - dug pits .
Their faces , when visible , were blank and without hope .
We had been turned away by a fat , corrupt policeman who pretended our papers were n't in order , but who was really taking instructions from a dead - eyed , one - eared gangmaster who sat next to him .
By the time we returned with more official permits , the gangmasters had readied the ambush .
The diggers feared - and their evil , sinister bosses had worked hard on that fear - that if people like me publicised their filthy way of life , then the mine might be closed and the $ 3 a day might be taken away .
I can give you no better explanation in miniature of the wicked thing that I believe is now happening in Africa .
Out of desperation , much of the continent is selling itself into a new era of corruption and virtual slavery as China seeks to buy up all the metals , minerals and oil she can lay her hands on : copper for electric and telephone cables , cobalt for mobile phones and jet engines - the basic raw materials of modern life .
It is crude rapacity , but to Africans and many of their leaders it is better than the alternative , which is slow starvation .
The Congolese risk their lives digging through mountains of mining waste looking for scraps of metal ore
It is my view - and not just because I was so nearly killed - that China 's cynical new version of imperialism in Africa is a wicked enterprise .
China offers both rulers and the ruled in Africa the simple , squalid advantages of shameless exploitation .
For the governments , there are gargantuan loans , promises of new roads , railways , hospitals and schools - in return for giving Peking a free and tax - free run at Africa 's rich resources of oil , minerals and metals .
For the people , there are these wretched leavings , which , miserable as they are , must be better than the near - starvation they otherwise face .
Persuasive academics advised me before I set off on this journey that China 's scramble for Africa had much to be said for it .
They pointed out China needs African markets for its goods , and has an interest in real economic advance in that broken continent .
For once , they argued , a foreign intervention in Africa might work precisely because it is so cynical and self - interested .
They said Western aid , with all its conditions , did little to create real advances in Africa , laughing as they declared : ' The only country that ever got rich through donations is the Vatican . '
Why get so het up about African corruption anyway ?
Is it really so much worse than corruption in Russia or India ?
Is it really our business to try to act as missionaries of purity ?
Is n't what we call ' corruption ' another name for what Africans view as looking after their families ?
And what about China herself ?
Despite the country 's convulsive growth and new wealth , it still suffers gravely from poverty and backwardness , as I have seen for myself in its dingy sweatshops , the primitive electricity - free villages of Canton , the dark and squalid mining city of Datong and the cave - dwelling settlements that still rely on wells for their water .
After the murderous disaster of Mao , and the long chaos that went before , China longs above all for stable prosperity .
And , as one genial and open - minded Chinese businessman said to me in Congo as we sat over a beer in the decayed colonial majesty of Lubumbashi's Belgian - built Park Hotel : ' Africa is China 's last hope . '
I find this argument quite appealing , in theory .
Britain's own adventures in Africa were not specially benevolent , although many decent men did what they could to enforce fairness and justice amid the bigotry and exploitation .
Taking over : Chinese building workers in Zambia
It is noticeable that in much former British territory we have left behind plenty of good things and habits that are absent in the lands once ruled by rival empires .
Even so , with Zimbabwe , Nigeria and Uganda on our conscience , who are we to lecture others ?
I chose to look at China 's intervention in two countries , Zambia and the ' Democratic Republic of the Congo ' , because they lie side by side ; because one was once British and the other Belgian .
Also , in Zambia 's imperfect but functioning democracy , there is actual opposition to the Chinese presence , while in the despotic Congo , opposition to President Joseph Kabila is unwise , to put it mildly .
Congo is barely a state at all , and still hosts plenty of fighting not all that far from here .
Statues and images of Joseph 's murdered father Laurent are everywhere in an obvious attempt to create a cult of personality on which stability may one day be based .
Portraits of Joseph himself scowl from every wall .
I have decided not to name most of the people who spoke to me , even though some of them gave me permission to do so , because I am not sure they know just how much of a risk they may be running by criticising the Chinese in Africa .
I know from personal experience with Chinese authority that Peking regards anything short of deep respect as insulting , and it does not forget a slight .
I also know that this over - sensitive vigilance is present in Africa .
The Mail on Sunday team was reported to the authorities in Zambia 's Copper Belt by Chinese managers who had seen us taking photographs of a graveyard at Chambishi where 54 victims of a disaster in a Chinese - run explosives factory are buried .
Within an hour , local ' security ' officials were buzzing round us trying to find out what we were up to .
This is why I have some time for the Zambian opposition politician Michael Sata , known as ' King Cobra ' because of his fearless combative nature ( but also , say his opponents , because he is so slippery ) .
Sata has challenged China 's plans to invest in Zambia , and is publicly suspicious of them .
At elections two years ago , the Chinese were widely believed to have privately threatened to pull out of the country if he won , and to have helped the government parties win .
Peking regards Zambia as a great prize , alongside its other favoured nations of Sudan ( oil ) , Angola ( oil ) and Congo ( metals ) .
Fighting back : Peter Hitchens with Michael Sata , the opposition politician nicknamed ' King Cobra '
It has cancelled Zambia 's debts , eased Zambian exports to China , established a ' special economic zone ' in the Copper Belt , offered to build a sports stadium , schools , a hospital and an anti-malaria centre as well as providing scholarships and dispatching experts to help with agriculture .
Zambia - China trade is growing rapidly , mainly in the form of copper .
All this has aroused the suspicions of Mr Sata , a populist politician famous for his blunt , combative manner and his harsh , biting attacks on opponents , and who was once a porter who swept the platforms at Victoria Station in London .
Now the leader of the Patriotic Front , with a respectable chance of winning a presidential election set for the end of October , Sata says : ' The Chinese are not here as investors , they are here as invaders .
' They bring Chinese to come and push wheelbarrows , they bring Chinese bricklayers , they bring Chinese carpenters , Chinese plumbers .
We have plenty of those in Zambia . '
This is true .
In Lusaka and in the Copper Belt , poor and lowly Chinese workers , in broad - brimmed straw hats from another era , are a common sight at mines and on building sites , as are better - dressed Chinese supervisors and technicians .
There are Chinese restaurants and Chinese clinics and Chinese housing compounds - and a growing number of Chinese flags flapping over factories and smelters .
' We do n't need to import labourers from China , ' Sata says .
' We need to import people with skills we do n't have in Zambia .
The Chinese are not going to train our people in how to push wheelbarrows . '
He meets me in the garden of his not specially grand house in the old - established and verdant Rhodes Park section of Lusaka .
It is guarded by uniformed security men , its walls protected by barbed wire and broken glass .
' Wherever our Chinese " brothers " are they do n't care about the local workers , ' he complains , alleging that Chinese companies have lax safety procedures and treat their African workers like dirt .
In language which seems exaggerated , but which will later turn out to be at least partly true , he claims : ' They employ people in slave conditions . '
He also accuses Chinese overseers of frequently beating up Zambians .
His claim is given force by a story in that morning 's Lusaka newspapers about how a Zambian building worker in Ndola , in the Copper Belt , was allegedly beaten unconscious by four Chinese co-workers angry that he had gone to sleep on the job .
I later checked this account with the victim 's relatives in an Ndola shanty town and found it to be true .
Evidence of China is never very far away
Recently , a government minister , Alice Simago , was shown weeping on TV after she saw at first hand the working conditions at a Chinese - owned coal mine in the Southern Province .
When I contacted her , she declined to speak to me about this - possibly because criticism of the Chinese is not welcome among most of the Zambian elite .
Denis Lukwesa , deputy general secretary of the Zambian Mineworkers ' Union , also backed up Sata 's view , saying : ' They just do n't understand about safety .
They are more interested in profit . '
As for their general treatment of African workers , Lukwesa says he knows of cases where Chinese supervisors have kicked Zambians .
He summed up their attitude like this : ' They are harsh to Zambians , and they do n't get on well with them . '
Sata warns against the enormous loans and offers of help with transport , schools and health care with which Peking now sweetens its attempts to buy up Africa 's mineral reserves .
' China 's deal with the Democratic Republic of the Congo is , in my opinion , corruption , ' he says , comparing this with Western loans which require strong measures against corruption .
Everyone in Africa knows China 's Congo deal - worth almost £ 5 billion in loans , roads , railways , hospitals and schools - was offered after Western experts demanded tougher anti-corruption measures in return for more aid .
Sata knows the Chinese are unpopular in his country .
Zambians use a mocking word - ' choncholi ' - to describe the way the Chinese speak .
Zambian businessmen gossip about the way the Chinese live in separate compounds , where - they claim - dogs are kept for food .
There are persistent rumours , which cropped up in almost every conversation I had in Zambia , that many of the imported Chinese workforce are convicted criminals whom China wants to offload in Africa .
I was unable to confirm this but , given China 's enormous gulag and the harshness of life for many migrant workers , it is certainly not impossible .
Sata warns that ' sticks and stones ' may one day fly if China does not treat Zambians better .
He now promises a completely new approach : ' I used to sweep up at your Victoria Station , and I never got any complaints about my work .
I want to sweep my country even cleaner than I swept your stations . '
Some Africa experts tend to portray Sata as a troublemaker .
His detractors whisper that he is a mouthpiece for Taiwan , which used to be recognised by many African states but which faces almost total isolation thanks to Peking 's new Africa policy .
But his claims were confirmed by a senior worker in Chambishi , scene of the 2005 explosion .
This man , whom I will call Thomas , is serious , experienced and responsible .
His verdict on the Chinese is devastating .
He recalls the aftermath of the blast , when he had the ghastly task of collecting together what remained of the men who died : ' Zambia , a country of 11 million people , went into official mourning for this disaster .
' A Chinese supervisor said to me in broken English , " In China , 5,000 people die , and there is nothing .
In Zambia , 50 people die and everyone is weeping . "
To them , 50 people are nothing . '
This sort of thing creates resentment .
Earlier this year African workers at the new Chinese smelter at Chambishi rioted over low wages and what they thought were unsafe working conditions .
When Chinese President Hu Jintao came to Zambia in 2006 , he had to cancel a visit to the Copper Belt for fear of hostile demonstrations .
Thomas says : ' The people who advised Hu Jintao not to come were right . '
He suspects Chinese arrogance and brutality towards Africans is not racial bigotry , but a fear of being seen to be weak .
' They are trying to prove they are not inferior to the West .
They are trying too hard .
' If they ask you to do something and you do n't do it , they think you 're not doing it because they are n't white .
People put up with the kicks and blows because they need work to survive . '
Many in Africa also accuse the Chinese of unconcealed corruption .
This is specially obvious in the ' Democratic Republic of the Congo ' , currently listed as the most corrupt nation on Earth .
A North - American businessman who runs a copper smelting business in Katanga Province told me how his firm tried to obey safety laws .
They are constantly targeted by official safety inspectors because they refuse to bribe them .
Meanwhile , Chinese enterprises nearby get away with huge breaches of the law - because they paid bribes .
' We never pay , ' he said , ' because once you pay you become their bitch ; you will pay for ever and ever . '
Another businessman shrugged over the way he is forced to wait weeks to get his products out of the country , while the Chinese have no such problems .
' I 'm not sure the Chinese even know there are customs regulations , ' he said .
' They do n't fill in the forms , they just pay .
I try to be philosophical about it , but it is not easy . '
Unlike orderly Zambia , Congo is a place of chaos , obvious privation , tyranny dressed up as democracy for public - relations purposes , and fear .
This is Katanga , the mineral - rich slice of land fought over furiously in the early Sixties in post - colonial Africa 's first civil war .
Brooding over its capital , Lubumbashi , is a 400 ft black hill : the accumulated slag and waste of 80 years of copper mining and smelting .
Now , thanks to a crazy rise in the price of copper and cobalt , the looming , sinister mound is being quarried - by Western business , by the Chinese and by bands of Congolese who grub and scramble around it searching for scraps of copper or traces of cobalt , smashing lumps of slag with great hammers as they hunt for any way of paying for that night 's supper .
As dusk falls and the shadows lengthen , the scene looks like the blasted land of Mordor in Tolkien 's Lord Of The Rings : a pre-medieval prospect of hopeless , condemned toil in pits surrounded by stony desolation .
Behind them tower the leaning ruins of colossal abandoned factories : monuments to the wars and chaos that have repeatedly passed this way .
There is something strange and unsettling about industrial scenes in Africa , pithead winding gear and gaunt chimneys rising out of tawny grasslands dotted with anthills and banana palms .
It looks as if someone has made a grave mistake .
And there is a lesson for colonial pride and ambition in the streets of Lubumbashi - 80 years ago an orderly Art Deco city full of French influence and supervised by crisply starched gendarmes , now a genial but volatile chaos of scruffy , bribe - hunting traffic cops where it is not wise to venture out at night .
The once - graceful Belgian buildings , gradually crumbling under thick layers of paint , long ago lost their original purpose .
Outsiders come and go in Africa , some greedy , some idealistic , some halfway between .
Time after time , they fail or are defeated , leaving behind scars , slag - heaps , ruins and graveyards , disillusion and disappointment .
We have come a long way from Cecil Rhodes to Bob Geldof , but we still have not brought much happiness with us , and even Nelson Mandela 's vaunted ' Rainbow Nation ' in South Africa is careering rapidly towards banana republic status .
Now a new great power , China , is scrambling for wealth , power and influence in this sad continent , without a single illusion or pretence .
Perhaps , after two centuries of humbug , this method will work where all other interventions have failed .
But after seeing the bitter , violent desperation unleashed in the mines of Likasi , I find it hard to believe any good will come of it .
Babies have been suffering kidney stones - rare in young children
The number of Chinese babies known to have fallen ill with kidney stones as a result of contaminated milk powder has risen to 432 , officials have announced .
" This is a severe food safety accident , " health ministry official Gao Qiang , said .
Those responsible would be " severely " punished , he added .
Later , it was announced that 19 people had been arrested .
Tests showed the milk powder contained the industrial chemical melamine .
One infant has died .
The new scare revived memories of a fake baby milk formula scandal four years ago in which at least 13 babies died .
Vow to punish
" As of 12 September , there are 432 cases of kidney stones in the urinary systems of infants according to reports from health departments nationwide , " Gao Qiang said .
" None of the milk powder was exported to other countries or regions , " Mr Gao said .
" Only a fraction of the milk powder was sold to Taiwan for food processing , " he added .
Gao Qiang said the Sanlu Group had been ordered to halt production after its products were found to be responsible .
" We will severely punish and discipline those people and workers who have acted illegally , " Mr Gao said .
Melamine is a toxic chemical used in plastics , fertilisers and cleaning products .
Sanlu ordered a recall of 700 tonnes of contaminated milk on Thursday
New Zealand - based dairy product company Fonterra Cooperative Group Ltd , a part - owner of Sanlu , ordered a recall of about 700 tonnes of powder contaminated with melamine believed to be in circulation .
Melamine has been used by Chinese suppliers of animal feed components to make them appear to have more protein .
It was linked to the formation of kidney stones and kidney failure in pets in the United States last year , leading to thousands of deaths and illnesses .
A fake milk powder scandal in 2004 killed at least 13 babies in the eastern province of Anhui .
Investigators found that the milk given to these babies had no nutritional value , and the resulting scandal triggered widespread investigations into food safety .
When was the last time you drove down the highway and saw a billboard that blew you away ?
What was the brand , product , or service ?
What made the billboard so special ?
Chances are , the best billboard ads you ’ve ever seen share powerful marketing elements .
If you ’re a brand owner , you may be wondering , “ What makes effective billboard ads so powerful , and can I create one for my own business ? ”
This article has the top three elements of the best billboard marketing of 2020 .
To learn how to create effective signage for your brand , read on .
1. Simplicity
Great design matters .
Studies show that a consumer forms an opinion about digital advertising in about 50 milliseconds or less .
In the best billboard ads ever , the design comes across quickly and effectively .
Consider that most of your potential target audience will be driving past your billboard , focusing on the road and other cars .
Your viewers do n’t have the time to read long copy or digest complicated visuals .
With a simple design , the audience can understand the message in seconds .
Simple billboard design uses only the most important words in the copy .
Also , the typography used is easy on the eyes and understood from far away .
Images and graphics follow this rule of simplicity as well .
Use vivid colors and crisp designs that will support the copy .
2. Creativity
To keep up with your competition , your advertising and marketing strategies must stand out among the masses .
Rather than a typical , stagnant billboard , why not get creative and go digital ?
Digital signage is memorable , effective , and creative .
One of the top reasons to go digital is the perk of customizing multiple messages for one billboard .
If your product or service has different attributes , digital signage allows you to tailor the message to serve more than one purpose .
Another way that digitization allows for some of the best billboard ads is by creating interactive experiences .
In an ever - changing advertising landscape , digital billboards stay relevant by engaging the audience .
The best digital billboards can evolve and serve your brand in more ways than one .
3. Consistency
Across all advertising and marketing strategies , your brand must stay consistent .
Studies show that consistent brand representation can increase revenue by up to 23 percent .
For the best billboard designs , consistent branding is a key element across markets .
One of your main priorities as a brand should be to garner brand recognition .
This refers to the ability of customers to recall your brand in many different circumstances .
For your billboard advertising , be sure that the design , word choice , and tone are consistent with your brand image .
This will help your audience recognize your brand and remember it for a longer period of time .
Create the Best Billboard for Your Brand Today
In the best billboard ads , consistency , creativity , and simplicity are key elements of the design .
To create the best billboard for your brand , be sure to implement these factors into your advertising and marketing .
Your brand image , long - term success rates , and consumer relationships will thank you .

Fishing marlins from helicopters .
It may sound boring , but seriously , you wo n't believe your eyes .
If your jaw does n't drop after watching this , I 'll post pictures of myself naked .
Update : do you think this is real or not ?
I think it is , but you can tell us your opinion in the comments .
I 've seen similar things before , with other fishes and from boats .
In this case , it looks absolutely real : it 's definitely not 3D or an animatronic - look how it swims away .

I 'm sure they tried a few times before actually achieving it , then edited the whole thing to make it appear as a single try .
You can also keep the marlin around with food and , like other fishes , they wo n't run away from you unless you try to approach underwater .
And finally , technically the video is impeccable .
Maybe that 's the trick , and it's fake after all , but I 'm inclined to believe that they got it after some hard work .

They arrested the wrong guy , while simultaneously breaking the chain of custody .
That 's an effective tactic .
The cops need to be protecting us from the officials , not the election officials control of the ballots hidden away from us .
So when someone starts asking questions and this escalates to arresting the person asking the questions , instead of answering the questions , or trying to find out the answers .
So what makes this whole thing have to be in such a hurry that public oversight and chain of custody are removed ?
It 's exactly backwards .
It 's another ruined election , that nobody can trust .

Obama 's team needs somebody out west to rile up the Libertarian types who have to be as offended as Democrats at this kind of election fraud behavior .
Maybe Ron Paul would like to give speeches out there .
A collaboration between Obama in the North East and the Clintons & Biden all over the East and Paul out West would create a pretty good coverage of the country .
Lord knows
Paul gives a pretty decent speech and has as much to gain on the election accuracy issue as anybody .

Anyone want to try and clue me in on how shit like this continues to happen and nobody is ever held accountable ?
Brakey obviously did nothing wrong , was doing his job yet HE gets arrested and the real guilty parties skate away as usual .
How is it that the blatantly guilty always skate away with whatever crime they commit as long as it is to do with election fraud or 9/11 cover up ?
Can not Blakey turn the tables here and get Nelson arrested ?
If not why not ?

Can someone please explain why these observers were arrested and what charges were brought .
How did the past arrests end up ?
Were charges dismissed ?
Do states have laws or regulations governing observers ?
If your just trying to remove someone to avoid oversight is n't calling for an arrest against the law ?
Are EI observers specially trained or certified ?
Are they paid ?
Appointed ?
I am writing a report for my US History Class .
Thanks ,

What strikes me , as always , is how subtle election fraud can be --- you can't hear it , you can't smell it , usually you can't see it , you can't prove it , and it 's easy for the perpetrator or complicit person to make the accuser look " crazy . "
And even if an elections official violates the code --- e.g. in this case , not assuming loss of chain of custody for unsealed ballots , there are too many barriers to ensuring that the code is enforced .
Yet there is so much to be gained or lost depending on the results of an election , that ANYTHING irregular should be taken VERY SERIOUSLY .

Sounds to me like video surveillance experts need to be placed to observe the election 's video surveillance team .
Wow , that 's a mouthful !
Really though , seen any good bank heist or spy thillers lately ?
Then , tell me what you think of the security of video surveillance .
Citizen observers with the integrity of Mr. Brakey watching in shifts a locked vault seems a more cost effective and secure route .
People unwilling to participate at that level need to remember UNSECURE ELECTIONS HAVE LED TO FALSE WARS OUR LOVED ONES ARE DYING IN , AND PARASITES ARE PROFITTING FROM TO THIS DAY .

When the police are protecting the criminals in office instead of citizens , you have a police state .
The fact that decent people are going to jail when doing nothing wrong shows the level of fight we have .
Most people are n't going to " buck the system " if it means losing their jobs and homes and possibly families .
And that 's what we 're looking at .
That 's called terrorism , and that 's what those in charge in America are using against their own citizens .
And the real kicker is , while we have people that can afford to fight , most of us can 't .. and those that do fight will simply be ridiculed by the moron masses in America .
Nothing is going to change because the masses do n't even understand why things should change , they do n't understand that they have lost their freedoms and basic rights under this terrorist tyranny .
Breaks my heart .

POST - EVENT ANALYSIS via public records - first " blood " ...
I went back into the " den of iniquity " known as the Pima Elections Office today , to begin the process of sorting out just what really happened during that hand - count .
First , understand that nine precincts were chosen at random by party officials ( all three , LP , Dem and GOP ) the night before .
Saturday AM , agreement was reached to add another nine so as the Sr. LP rep present ( well OK , * only * ... ) , I helped randomly pick another nine .
The first nine precinct bags were already present , so we started on those while the next were fetched from another area .
This is important .
What John noted was that among those nine , at least seven bags had " chain of custody issues " of some sort .
In some the bags lacked the tracking info sheet hand - written by pollworkers that was supposed to be in there , in others the tracking info was present but spoke of a seal number different from what was on the outside of the bag , while in other cases the seal was either missing completely or inadequately attached so as to allow unrestricted ( and untracked ) access to the bag 's contents .
The number could have been higher in that first nine but John was booted for asking too many questions before he could finish checking .
And this booting was at least in part at the suggestion of the GOP party chair , Judy White .
Of the next batch of nine , at least one are known to have funky seal issues , including precinct 139 ( second batch ) that I personally inspected that day and reported as a serial number mis-match .
( Soon after John left , the remaining Democratic Party credentialed observer ( Mickey Dunahoe ) was asked to serve as an additional hand - counter .
The * appearance * is that this prevented Mickey from catching and following up on the same issues John had found and been booted for . )
CRITICAL POINT NUMBER ONE : According to election director Brad Nelson , speaking on camera today ( did I mention the two guys with video cameras following me ? ) , Brad says that out of 100 ballot bags , he would expect no more than 5 % to have funky seals of any sort .
Therefore , a 7 out of 9 " screwball rate " among that first batch is a shocking statistical spike .
The unproven ( so far ) implication is that the ballots were examined and / or tampered with the night before the hand - audit , starting moments after the parties hat - picked precincts on Friday .
Continuing Investigation I was able to obtain the receiving board forms showing who checked in the ballot bags .
Most were from temporary citizen workers at receiving boards ; very rural areas used Sheriff 's deputies for the same function .
The final canvass and official results are scheduled for Friday so I have three days to find those people and figure out what happened .
I doubt many ( if any ) are involved in a vote - hacking conspiracy , certainly not all , therefore it should be possible to check what 's going on here .
It boils down to this : either this election WAS hacked somehow , or there was an effort to hide serious machine failures , or the processes and procedures ( and pollworker training ) under Nelson 's management are so bad that the paperwork is going to stink on a much higher percentage of bags than Nelson 's 5 % guesstimate .
At this moment I have no clue which of these three possibilities is going on .
I 'll report back when I know more .
I 'll tell you this though : ALL THREE possible scenarios paint Brad Nelson 's management in a bad light .
As does his known dating of at least one staff member , as does his office 's habit of printing the " who 's winning and losing " reports up to nine days pre-election until we spotted that in the audit logs and put a stop to it ( we hope ) , as is his letting staff take CDs with election data on them home during election cycles as an " off - site backup plan " , as does his penchant for secrecy , his bullying nature , I could go on for days .
Basically , Nelson has given the county good reason to fire him almost a dozen times over .
The fact that he still works there at all suggests ... well , that he has something ( s? ) on the Board of Supes of Pima County , or a powerful protector .
If it 's possible to do so , I 'll get to the bottom of this .
Post - script on John 's arrest : while I did n't see it happen or even know of it until later , I 'm told by witnesses that it happened in the hallway just outside the room I was counting in .
I was near the door ; had John been in any way loud or unruly I would have heard it .
John sure as hell CAN be loud , he 'll be the first to tell you that , but he was n't in this case !

If you read the legislation passed in our Government since the time of 9/11 , a picture begins to emerge ...... NSPD - 51 attaches Homeland Insecurity to none other than the Dept. of Treasury , HMMMM ... Now , if you actually read the Patriot Act (s ) it is highly documented that Homeland Insecurity is mentioned many times even though it was n't even officially created for more than a year after 9/11 .
It looks to me like Homeland insecurity is running a diversion operation to loot the nation of Trillions of dollars which is why they are attached to the Treasury Department .
Now , having said all that ,
It would make sense to me that they would NEED to hack the election process as a cover operation for the looting of the nation .
If Mcbrain and Osama Obama are in the know , either one would be able to continue the facade .

Jim March - good work .
What gets me is not whether Nelson has a " protector " or not , but that GOP VOTERS would be ok with their party handling votes this way .
As long as the votes are swayed their way , they have no problem with fraud ?
Why does it only seem to be Democratic voters who are up in arms about voting fraud ?

Inca : the board of supes that protects this guy has five members - including three who are all allegedly Democrat .
As is the county attorney ( Barbara LaWall ) who has covered for Nelson in numerous ways .
( The " county attorney " in an AZ county is also the DA as well as the county 's civil attorney . )
Pima County politics do NOT split on the normal GOP / Dem faultlines .
This is the freakin ' desert - the big issue is growth ( until recently VERY rapid ) and the water to feed it .
That colors every other issue .
The now - famous Regional Transportation Authority $ 2bil bond measure of 2006 ( sales tax to pay for increased transit ) was also basically a pro-growth thing .
Major developers woo members of both parties .
Our biggest ally on the Board of Supes is Ray Carrol - a Republican ... followed closely by the chair , Richard Elias ( Dem ) .
DO NOT try and apply standard GOP v. Dem thinking to Pima County in particular .
That ai n't what drives stuff behind the scenes .

We need similar coverage for Maricopa Country !
The elections procedures here are incredibly sloppy , training inadequate , and the Touchscreen Voting equipment a disaster .
Helen Purcell has been in her position much too long .
Time to resign .
Much of the Elections Department staff seems to have retired into their jobs as they sleepwalk through their responsibilities .
Best to fire them as well .
Arizona is setting itself up to be the next national embarrassment in the style of Florida and Ohio .
Many people are being disenfranchised .
Do n't let it happen !

SAVE FAVORITESVIEW FAVORITES ( 0.0 from 0 ratings ) View Ratings | Rate It
The rules re : participation of citizen observers are usually available on the web sites of our states ' legislatures and / or our states ' web sites of the Secretaries of State .
Each citizen election observer is a precious symbol of what defines the best of being the same law - abiding American he / she is now - AND prior to the last 8 years . :::::::: I spoke with Brad Nelson and John Brakey - separately today Tuesday , September 9 , 2008 .
Brad Nelson stated to me tht he had no problems with John Brakey 's writing down the seal numbers in question .
I asked Brad if John had been sworn in .
Brad said he was looking it up - put me on hold for maybe 3 minutes .
Upon Brad 's return to the phone , he said John had n't been one of the parties sworn in .
Brad told me he repeatedly told John to come to HIM with questions .
Before calling Brad Nelson , I located the following : ( web site listed below at the end of this diary ) Article 10 Tally and Returns 16-603 .
Inspection of ballots by party representative " ... without unduly hindering or delaying the count , ... "
After calling Brad Nelson , I called John Brakey .
To paraphrase : John had an immediate deja vu of the past events which have become to be known as " Hack and Stack . "
He chose to promptly perform his duties : he reported to US .
John has absolutely no desire for martyrdom .
John was adamant in explaining that he made a personal choice and strongly calls for persons who wish to serve as educated and prepared citizen observers to come onboard .
He 's truly a Renaissance man .
John emphasized that when the educated and prepared election citizen observers volunteer , they must make their own decisions regarding their roles .
Arizona Legislature link does n't work here .
Article 10 Tally and Returns 16-603 .
Inspection of ballots by party representative I have various subject interests including exploring the reality of regaining all of our Constitutional Rights pre G.W. Bush , Jr. 's Presidency , Interfaith Activites for Judaism , Islam , Hinduism , Christianity and all world religions inclusive .
My other interest is medieval Spain , in the Era of Convivencia .

Did anyone else notice that the press allowed Brad Nelson to BS along instead of getting the answer as to WHY John Brakey was arrested ?
This report is not " very good " - it is however " very good " at being deceptive .
The crux of the problem was not addressed .
It may look " good " because they at least made a story of it , but in the end it was actually appeasing instead of factual .
Is n't this identical to Hitler 's tactics ?
