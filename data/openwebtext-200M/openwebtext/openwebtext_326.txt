" Two planes struck two buildings …. but how is it that a third building fell 5 hours later ? " asked Ventura , " How could this building just implode into its own footprint 5 hours later – that ’s my first question – the 9/11 Commission did n’t even devote one page to that in their big volume of investigation , " added the former Governor .
Former Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura vehemently savaged the official 9/11 story on a syndicated national radio show today , saying the WTC collapsed like a controlled demolition and was pulverized to dust as he also highlighted the impossible 10 second free fall speed of the towers .
Appearing on The Alex Jones Show , Ventura said that his initial reaction to 9/11 was much like most people at the time , and he accepted the official story outright , a response he now regrets because he was in a position of power and could have used it to raise a lot of pointed questions .
" I kicked myself when it initially happened that the light did n’t go off but I was so shocked that this thing had even taken place that I apologize for not being more aware , " said Ventura , adding that watching Loose Change at the insistence of his son was part of the catalyst for his wake up call .
Host Alex Jones is executive producer of Loose Change ( get it here ) , the most watched Internet movie of all time .
Ventura said he ran through a rollercoaster of emotions when he saw the film .
" When I finally did watch it I went through every emotion you could imagine , from laughing , crying , getting sick to my stomach , to the whole emotional thing , " said the former Governor .
" To me questions have n’t been answered and are not being answered about 9/11 , " said Ventura , before highlighting the collapse of Building 7 , a 47 - story tall skyscraper that was not hit by a plane but collapsed in its own footprint in the late afternoon of September 11 .
" Two planes struck two buildings …. but how is it that a third building fell 5 hours later ? " asked Ventura , " How could this building just implode into its own footprint 5 hours later – that ’s my first question – the 9/11 Commission did n’t even devote one page to that in their big volume of investigation , " added the former Governor .
Ventura then explored how it was possible that all three buildings could rapidly collapse at almost free fall speed .
" How could those buildings fall at the speed of gravity – if you put a stopwatch on them both of those World Trade Center buildings were on the ground in ten seconds – how can that be ? " asked Ventura .
" If you took a billiard ball and dropped it from the height of the World Trade Center in a vacuum it would hit the ground in 9.3 seconds and if you took that same billiard ball and dropped it 10 stories at a time and merely stopped it and started it it would take 30 seconds – if you dropped it every floor of the World Trade Center to the ground , simply stopping and starting it on gravity it would take over 100 seconds to reach the ground , " he surmised .
The former wrestling star then questioned how low - temperature burning jet fuel could melt steel .
" Jet fuel is four fifths kerosene – which is not a hot burning fuel – and they wanted us to believe it melted these steel structured girders and caused these buildings to pancake collapse to the ground ? " he stated .
" I was on the site within two weeks after it happened and I saw none of these pancakes – would n’t they all be piled up in a huge mass on the ground and yet everything was blown into dust – when you look at it from that aspect none of it makes any sense , " said Ventura .
" Never before in the annuls of history has a fire caused a steel structure building to fall to the ground like these two did , " he concluded .
Having undergone Basic Underwater Demolition Seal training , Ventura is speaking from an experienced standpoint and he unequivocally stated that he thought the buildings were deliberately imploded .
" Upon looking at the film in super - slow motion and the way the buildings fell and comparing that to the way that they do like a controlled demolition of a hotel in Las Vegas , they both fell identical . "
" I did watch the film of Building 7 going down and in my opinion there ’s no doubt that that building was brought down with demolition , " said the former Governor .
Ventura also questioned the lack of wreckage outside of the Pentagon after Flight 77 allegedly struck the building .
" When I was watching Loose Change with a friend of mine – he happens to work for a company that helps build the Boeing airplanes and they said that when the engines completely disappeared and were destroyed , his response was , excuse my French – bullshit ! , " said Ventura .
" I turned to him and said why and he said because they ’re made of titanium steel – they ca n’t disintegrate . "
Ventura said that the corporate media were going to continue to cover - up the truth about 9/11 , but that the number of credible people speaking out and increasing education and knowledge about the subject would eventually reap dividends .
" We do n’t want to lose our country , after all it ’s still our country and until they put us down we have the power , " Ventura concluded .
The Governor ’s bold comments about 9/11 come on the heels of similar views expressed by American icon Willie Nelson during an interview on the same radio show in February .

Last night , Rep. Robert Wexler ( D - FL ) took to the House floor to urge the House Judiciary Committee to begin impeachment hearings into Vice President Cheney for “ high crimes and misdemeanors . ”
[ During which , Wexler specifically mentions Impeach for Peace ’s contributions to the process !]
Wexler , who has already acquired nearly 190,000 supporters through his website , explained his next steps :
< table summary = " Impeach Bush " width = " 100 % " border= " 3 " align=" center " cellpadding = " 3 " cellspacing = " 3 " > < tr >< td > Tomorrow , I will deliver these names to my colleagues on the Judiciary Committee with a letter to my friend , Chairman Conyers , calling for hearings .
I will ask my colleagues to sign this letter " ¦
Continuing every day for months , I will publish in the Congressional Record several thousand names of supporters who signed up .
History demands that we take action , because the case against Vice President Cheney is far stronger than the illegality surrounding Watergate .

“ In the history of our nation , we have never encountered a moment where the actions of a President or a Vice President have more strongly demanded the use of the power of impeachment , ”  Wexler said last night .
It Was n't the Sex ; Suspicious $ $ Transfers Led to Spitzer Officials say Spitzer is " Client 9 " in a complaint against a prostitution ring .
March 10 , 2008  --
The federal investigation of a New York prostitution ring was triggered by Gov. Eliot Spitzer 's suspicious money transfers , initially leading agents to believe Spitzer was hiding bribes , according to federal officials .
It was only months later that the IRS and the FBI determined that Spitzer was n't hiding bribes but payments to a company called QAT , what prosecutors say is a prostitution operation operating under the name of the Emperor 's Club .
As recently as this past Valentine 's Day , Feb. 13 , Spitzer , who officials say is identified in a federal complaint as " Client 9 , " arranged for a prostitute " Kristen " to meet him in Washington , D.C .
The woman met Client 9 at the Mayflower Hotel , room 871 , " for her tryst , " according to the complaint .
Client 9 also is alleged to have paid for the woman 's train tickets , cab fare , mini bar and room service , travel time and hotel .
The suspicious financial activity was initially reported by a bank to the IRS which , under direction from the Justice Department , brought in the FBI 's Public Corruption Squad .
" We had no interest at all in the prostitution ring until the thing with Spitzer led us to learn about it , " said one Justice Department official .
Spitzer , who made his name by bringing high - profile cases against many of New York 's financial giants , is likely to be prosecuted under a relatively obscure statute called " structuring , " according to a Justice Department official .
Structuring involves creating a series of financial movements designed to obscure the true purpose of the payments .
Prosecutors reportedly have a series of e-mails and wiretapped phone conversations of Spitzer .
In a interview two years ago , Spitzer , then - attorney general , told ABC News he had some advice for people who break the law .
" Never talk when you can nod , and never nod when you can wink , and never write an e-mail because it 's death .
You 're giving prosecutors all the evidence we need , " he said .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Increased market volatility brought gains and pain for many hedge funds in 2007 , pummeling computer - based quant strategies but producing big wins for bets in emerging markets and on credit travails , according to industry watchers .
Overall , the average hedge fund ended 2007 in solid double - digit positive territory ; but there were wide disparities of performance , with some top funds doubling or more in value and others falling by double digits .
Hedge fund performance analysis is always incomplete or misleading , since the privately held funds typically report only to their investors .
But three large indices that compile figures -- Hedge Fund Research , Barclay Hedge and Hennessee Group -- all showed industry gains for 2007 , up 10.36 percent , 10.4 percent and 11.64 percent respectively .
Overall , a big winning strategy was betting on emerging markets , particularly Asia- related , as hedge funds rode strong gains for equities markets overseas .
“ It was a strong year for all emerging markets , ” said Matthias Westman , chief executive of Prosperity Capital Management , a $ 5 billion fund group focused on Russia .
Two of Westman ’s funds , Prosperity and Quest , were up 16 percent and 25 percent respectively in 2007 , prompting the firm this month to launch a central European fund to focus on Kazakhstan , Uzbekistan and Georgia .
“ We think the market has developed further along enough to focus on that , ” said Westman , who said he ’s optimistic for 2008 but concerned that “ a real meltdown ” in developed markets would hit his strategies .
China - focused strategies produced big winners , with Greenwoods Asset Management ’s Golden China fund up 96.95 percent in 2007 and the Boyer Allan ’s Greater China Fund up 77 percent , according to numbers they reported to investors .
And Boyer Allan ’s India Fund was also up 68.7 percent for the year .
“ Emerging markets stole the show in 2007 , ” said Barclay Group President Sol Waksman , who said the emerging market index for the thousands of hedge funds in the Barclay index was up 23 percent for 2007 .
The big losers were quant strategies , whose highly leveraged computer - driven trading models were caught flat - footed by a market volatility spike following the subprime lending market meltdown at the summer .
High - profile Renaissance Technologies Corp ’s Institutional Equities Fund , launched in 2005 to much fanfare as one that could successfully trade $ 100 billion , ended the year down 0.2 percent .
The lackluster performance caused investors to pull some $ 4 billion out of the fund , leaving about $ 22 billion at year - end .
Renaissance declined to comment .
Goldman Sachs Group Inc's GS.N Goldman Sachs Global Alpha Fund fared much worse , falling nearly 40 percent for the year , according to an investor .
Goldman declined to comment .
Other funds won big on the mortgage mess , mainly by shorting asset - backed securities indexes that fell on declining values of securities backed by subprime mortgages .
Among major funds , Paulson & Co , a fund colossus with $ 28 billion under management , was a big winner , with its Credit Opportunities Fund up 590 percent for 2007 , according to sources .
Other funds -- including Harbinger Capital , MKP Capital and the smaller Balestra Capital and Lahde Capital funds -- were also big winners in credit trades in 2007 .
Paulson founder John Paulson told investors that last year ’s bet against subprime mortgages was “ the greatest asymmetrical trade ” he had ever seen , meaning the upside was almost limitless but the downside risk was small .
Among other strategies , Paulson was also a big winner in merger arbitrage and event - driven investing , which bet on corporate events like mergers and bankruptcies , among others .
Paulson Partners , the firm ’s flagship fund , was up 51 percent for 2007 , sources said .
The Pyramids unquestionably take out ahead of time listed below .
Not only carries out the China Pyramid overshadow the Great Wall surfaces 8 meters with its own ( initial ) 146.6 meters .
The China Pyramid was the highest male created a design on earth for over 3800 years .
The initial photograph of a Mandarin pyramid was tackled July 4 , 1945 , at the end of World War II .
The Pyramid lies in the Qin Ling Mountain Chains regarding 70 kilometers South west of Xi’an .
For safety and security causes the image was maintained a carefully guarded trick of the United States Armed forces for Forty - Five years just before this ended up being public knowledge .
They exemplify maybe the earliest image report of these structures and the ordinaries around this historical , political center were discovered to be populated along with all of them .
A few have base dimensions two times those from the lot more well - known Egyptian pyramids .
Its simple , the presence from megalithic pyramid facilities shakes off typical Chinese background and also pushes individuals to approve that they acquired this incorrect .
Welcome to the that ’s one of the most well - known sources for pyramids and old enigmas research because 2008 .
The life from pyramids in China has actually can be found in 2 stages .
Most early accounts were paid attention to the existence from “ Great White Pyramid . ”
A picture of this pyramid in the Qinling hills was taken through Americans in 1945 but continued to be in military files for 45 years .
US
Flying force aviator James Gaussman is mentioned to have seen a white gem topped pyramid during a tour in between India and China in the course of The Second World War , yet there is little evidence for a source on this story .
The Cheops Pyramid is thought to have been designed throughout Twenty Years .
In bare comparison , the Great Wall , on the other hand , was continually created , prolonged and maintained up until the 1500s .
Whether you think the Pyramids succeed for dealing with development in a briefer amount of time , or the Great Wall structure succeeds for determination , there is no refuting that both are impressive .
Score : 17 ( out of 100 )
Highs : Off - road ability
Lows : Ride , handling , braking , noise , fuel economy , fit and finish , visibility , frontseat comfort , access , reliability
Consumer Reports performs off - road testing at its Connecticut proving grounds , but off - road ability does n't factor into the final scores .
That 's part of the reason the Wrangler Unlimited gets the lowest score of any vehicle the magazine currently rates .
" We 're rating these cars as most people would drive them in the SUV category , " said Jake Fisher , a Consumer Reports auto test engineer .
While Jeep boasts that it sells to more owners who actually drive off - road than any other brand , the majority still spend most of their time on pavement .
A spokeswoman for Chrysler pointed out that the Jeep and Dodge vehicles in this list were fundamentally engineered for heavy - duty off - road use and the Jeeps , in particular , have been rated highly by other publications .

The United States military announced yesterday that it was bringing death penalty charges against Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and five other men suspected of orchestrating the September 11 attacks , and intended to try them under the Bush administration 's much - criticised military tribunal system , which is subject only to partial oversight by the civilian appeals system .
The decision to use Mohammed and the others as guinea - pigs in a constitutionally dubious legal proceeding is likely to trigger a firestorm of anti-American sentiment in the Islamic world and spark a fractious domestic debate in an already highly charged presidential election year .
Concerns were raised last night of political interference by the White House in the military 's decision to go to trial in the middle of an election campaign in which the Republican frontrunner , John McCain , has made the fight against al - Qa'ida central to his election bid .

" What we are looking at is a series of show trials by the Bush administration that are really devoid of any due process considerations , " said Vincent Warren , the executive director head of Centre for Constitutional Rights , which represents many Guantanamo detainees .
" Rather than playing politics the Bush administration should be seeking speedy and fair trials , " he said .
" These are trials that are going to be based on torture as confessions as well as secret evidence .
There is no way that this can be said to be fair especially as the death penalty could be an outcome . "
While few doubts have been raised , domestically or internationally , about the men's involvement in the attacks on New York and Washington , just about everything else about their treatment has been bitterly contested and is likely to continue to be contested , inside the courtroom and out .
Everything is laden with potential controversy – the decision to try the six men together rather than individually , the proposed venue at Guantanamo Bay , where all six are being held , the threatened use of the death penalty , and perhaps the most controversial question of all : the admissibility of evidence gathered through waterboarding and other coercive techniques generally defined as torture .
Even Brig - Gen Thomas Hartmann , the Pentagon official co-ordinating the case , acknowledged yesterday that it could be several months before a trial begins and months more , if not years , before any death penalty – assuming it is enforced – is carried out .
General Hartmann was careful to say that he wanted the trial proceedings to be " as completely open as possible " , with lawyers and journalists present in the courtroom – barring the possibility of some closed sessions to consider classified information .
He stressed that the men would be regarded as innocent until proven guilty , just as they would in a civilian court .
And he promised to provide " every piece of evidence , every stitch of evidence , every whiff of evidence " to the defendants ' lawyers so they would be fully able to prepare for trial .
That did little to stop Clive Stafford Smith , the British lawyer who has worked on behalf of " enemy combatants " at Guantanamo , to issue a condemnation of the " kangaroo court " .
He said : " Anyone can see the hypocrisy of espousing human rights , then trampling on them .
We will infuriate our allies who firmly oppose the death penalty .
We will anger the world . "
Aside from Mohammed , alleged to be the mastermind who planned and coordinated the September 11 attacks , the defendants are Mohammed al - Qahtani , labelled by US officials the " 20th hijacker " who never made it on board any of the planes that were crashed ; Ramzi Bin al - Shibh , an associate of Mohammed Atta 's in Hamburg who is believed to have acted as an intermediary between the hijackers and the al - Qa'ida leadership ; Ali Abd al - Aziz Ali , a nephew of Mohammed 's suspected of acting as his chief lieutenant ;
Waleed bin Attash , believed to have trained the hijackers ; and Mustafa Ahmad al - Hawsawi .
But contrary to General Hartmann 's assurances , it is far from clear what rights any of these men will have .
The Supreme Court , which struck down an earlier version of the military tribunal system , is expected to rule before July on whether the protections of the US Constitution apply to them .

Several commentators noted yesterday that the Bush administration is taking a risk by trying to press ahead with the trials .
Its previous efforts to pursue justice against suspected terrorists have been patchy , if not downright disastrous .
Zacarias Moussaoui , the French national previously labelled the 20th hijacker , escaped the death penalty at his civilian trial and emerged as a deeply disturbed individual scarcely capable of participating in a sophisticated guerrilla operation – much to the embarrassment of the federal prosecutors who tried him in civilian court in Virginia .
Jose Padilla , the US citizen accused of wanting to detonate a radioactive " dirty bomb " , won the argument that he could not be held indefinitely in military custody without trial and went on trial in civilian court .
He received a far lighter sentence than his prosecutors were seeking – 17 years instead of 30 to life .
The Bush administration appears to believe that , politically at least , it can win the argument by stirring up the country 's emotions about the worst peacetime attack on its own soil .

Greedy physicians addicted to money are literally abusing and battering patients for the sake of profit .
Physicians and mass media often depict patients and their lawyers who file lawsuits against doctors as greedy , money - grubbing opportunist .
1
It turns out this is more projection than reality .
A 1990 study by Harvard researchers of 31,000 medical records subjected to evaluation by practicing doctors and nurses , " found that doctors were injuring one out of every 25 patients ( latter studies put that figure closer to one out of every seven patients ) , and that only 4 percent of these injured patients sued . "
2 Another Harvard study of 1,452 malpractice lawsuits found that more than 90 percent of the claims evidence supported medical injury and 25 percent of the time the patient died , 60 % of these injuries resulted from physician wrongdoing .
The study also found when " baseless " malpractice suits were brought they were " efficiently thrown out . "
Only 145 of 515 patients suffering injury , but where physician fault was unclear received compensation .
On the other hand , 236 cases were thrown out of court despite evidence of injury and physician error .
3 . While there is no evidence that malpractice claims are being driven by greedy patients and lawyers , there is an abundance of evidence that greed is driving the malpractice suits .
Not the greed of the patients , but the greed of the medical practitioners themselves .
In other words , physicians are the greedy , money - grubbing opportunists , and the patients and their lawyers are just fighting back against an arrogant disregard for patient 's rights , dignity , and health , against incompetence and even fraud .
In a real way , a vast body of doctors have waged war on patients , arrogantly imposing their will and interest against the patients ' will and best interest .
Laws , medical licensing boards , and even lawsuits have largely failed to discourage profitable , but reckless and abusive practices .
Below are a several examples of how physicians abuse patients for personal profit , a brief analysis of patient protections , followed by some suggestions for fighting back .
1. Kickback - driven medicine :
An overwhelming number of physicians get kickbacks and other economic incentives from pharmaceutical companies , not only for being willing to prescribe a drug , or implant a devise , but also for research .
Often , physicians also get kickbacks from other physicians , hospitals , and imaging facilities to which they refer patients .
Physicians even get kickbacks for implant devises .
Influenced by a greed for these kickbacks , many physicians prescribe medications and procedures they know are NOT the most effective response to a problem , or may even be for a problem you do not have .
4 . In one study one third of the doctors interviewed , " admitted they would order unnecessary MRI scans and 25 % referred patients to an imaging center where they had a financial interest . "
20 .
2. Promoting unnecessary surgeries : Physicians often fail to tell a patient of less radical alternatives , fail to disclose and even mislead patients about risks , and encourage a patient to elect surgeries that are not good for their health .
" While it is difficult to distinguish " necessary " from " unnecessary " surgeries , some estimates put the latter at 2.5 million a year , resulting in 11,600 deaths a year as well as severe pain and disability for many of the survivors . "
5 . Breast implants are just one example .
Implants are never permanent .
Most will require another surgery within five years , virtually 100 % fail within 10 years .
6 . Reconstruction after a mastectomy requires multiple surgeries ( including one on the healthy breast ) , and thus provides a whole string of opportunities for surgeons to make big bucks .
For women with cancer this is particularly cruel even murderous as evidence indicates that physical trauma the like of multiple surgeries can encourage the spread of cancer .
7 . Surgeons virtually never reveal this trauma induced cancer growth risk .
Even women 's magazines have described new " perky " breasts , and perhaps even a tummy tuck , as a couple among ten reasons to " be glad you have breast cancer . "
8 . While plastic surgeons claim options for such reconstruction are , " essential to women 's self - esteem " , there are less dangerous roads to dealing with self - esteem issues , patients are not well informed of risks , and surgeons literally peddle reconstruction .
The only unsolicited call I ever remember receiving from my breast cancer surgeon was to inquire as to why I would turn down reconstruction .
( Wonder if she was to get a kickback from the plastic surgeon , who acted as if he got kickbacks for implants . )
3 . Bait and switch :
You do a little research , meet and agree to a surgery by a certain physician , chosen for various reasons , experience , sex , bedside manor , temperament ; then , once under anesthesia , your surgeon pulls a bait and switch .
The person actually performing the surgery is much less experienced , or this may even be their first surgery , or first surgery of this type .
Sometimes the surgeon you thought was performing is in attendance supervising .
Your life threatening surgery is being used as training and you are an unwitting breathing cadaver .
9
Other times the person you thought was performing the surgery has moved on to a high paying client and left you with a resident under no supervision .
The surgeon you thought was performing is paid for miraculously doing two surgeries at once in two different locations .
10 The resident is on salary .
Unnecessary procedures and exams for the sake of training :
Physicians will lie .
Physicians target the poor

Attorney General Michael B. Mukasey said this morning that waterboarding was deemed legal by the Justice Department at the time it was used by the CIA on three al - Qaeda captives , and as a result the Justice Department “ cannot possibly ” investigate whether a crime occurred .
In testimony before the House Judiciary Committee , Mukasey said that because waterboarding was part of a program approved by Justice lawyers , there is no way the department can open a criminal investigation into the practice . Â
“ Waterboarding , because it was authorized to be part of a program … cannot possibly be the subject of a Justice Department investigation , ” Mukasey said in response to questions from panel Chairman John Conyers Jr. ( D - Mich . ) .
“ That would mean that the same department that authorized the program would now prosecute someone for taking part ” in it , he said .

Pinabalot ko at dinala ko sa bahay ( sayang naman iiwan lang , mahal din ang order lol ) .
We were so full ...
Kwentuhan muna saglit .. until we came to a dream wedding talked .. toinks !!!
I wanted to have a wedding similar to Judy Ann and Ryan wedding setting .. which was held in the beach but , not neccesary in the beach pwede rin in the garden like EDEN Nature Park then the ceremony will be at the dawn like 5 o'clock in the morning ... as I walk down the aisle it should look like this ( a candle inside in the brown paper bag placed in the pathways ) .. all guests should wear white dress ( cocktail dress ) .
If it is held in the beach .. dapat naka paa lang tayo lahat .
if it is held in the graden naka tsinelas .. not a formal attire should be ..
I want all to be comfortable ..
The foods we serve should be like puto maya , chokolate and other breakfast meal not a heavy meal ....

After , biroan .. we decide to strolled around downtown areas again .
We dropped by at Body Bliss claveria branch to have back massage .
We were waited for 30 minutes kasi occupied lahat ang mga therapists and beds as well .
After 30 minutes , there were couple lumabas tapos na sila , so ako naman " hayz salamat at kami na ang sunod " .
Nag taka ako bakit di pa kami pinapasok sa loob may vacant na naman ..
I asked the receptionist , " Ms , di ba may lumabas na ?
bakit hindi pa kami pinapasok sa loob ? " .
Mam , naubosan po kami ng beddings , pumunta pa po kasi sa laundry shop para kunin yung mga nilabhan na .. bawal po kasi gamitin yung pinaggamitan na ng iba .. marumi na po kasi yun . "
Mam , kung gusto nyo yung lanang branch namin may mga vacant beds sila ang therapists baka gusto nyo dun . " at napa hala ako talaga !
layo naman nun Ms.. cge antay nalang kami .
We 've waited for another 30 minutes ..
after 30 minutes ............................................
Ms. uwi nalang kami like 1 hour na kami nag antay .. sayang at sarap pa naman sana mag pa masahe :( no choice but uwi nalang kami ..
Congress Passes New Budget , Hold Onto Your Wallets
It is a phrase that conservatives say over and over again .
It is always true , and it will always be true .
The phrase is said so often that it probably loses it ’s luster .
Last week it was proven true once again .
What phrase am I referring to ?
This one :
( Insert Democrat name here ) is a tax and spend liberal .
Last week the Democrats passed a new $ 300 billion dollar budget increase over the next five years .
How are they going to pay for this ?
I do n’t even have to answer that question , we all know the answer .
By raising taxes , naturally .
It wo n’t just be by repealing Bush ’s tax cuts though , as Democrats have promised .
It wo n’t just be by raising taxes on the rich , not unless we redefine the term “ rich . ”
From the Washington Post :
“ ( Barack ) Obama and ( Hillary ) Clinton both promise to reverse Bush ’s tax cuts for wealthier taxpayers , but the Democratic budget they ’ll be voting for would allow income tax rates to go up on individuals making as little as $ 31,850 and couples earning $ 63,700 or more , ”
Congratulations are in order for all working Americans out there , YOU ARE RICH .
Way to go , I bet you did n’t even know how rich you were until now .
Truth be told , everyone knows that Democrats consider people who have a job and work for a living “ rich . ”
Everyone knows that Democrats always take money from the workers to give it to people who are n’t working to support themselves .
If you did n’t realize that before now , maybe this will help you realize what the Democrats stand for .
We are in a time where the “ experts ” say we may be headed for a recession , and Democrats tell us that the middle class is struggling just to get by .
So what is their solution to this problem ?
To take more of our money away .
About $ 2000 a year away to be exact .
That sounds like a sound economic policy , does n’t it ?
As bad as this sounds it will get much worse .
After November , it will get much worse .
Just wait until we get “ free ” health - care .
You will be amazed at how much “ free ” can cost .
The term “ tax and spend ” has never rung so true , it is such a sweet sound to the Democrat ’s ears .

Oh no , no , no , no , no !
by Jeremy Hooper
Remember this morning when we highlighted a comment that was left on our website over the weekend ?
And remember how when we Googled the email address that was given to us by the commenter , it linked back to an official with a Texas public school system ?
Well , we had thought that Texas school system would want to get to bottom of why someone was using their school - associated work account to foster anti-gay bias .
Instead , however , they have taken the opportunity to try and threaten and intimidate us .
This email just came us to from a tech guy within the Mckinney Independent School District :
Our reply is after the jump :
Note :
Here 's the thing :
We have no desire to hurt someone or their livelihood .
But the fact is that we have a right and responsibility to monitor every bit of bias that is directed towards us .
We respond to bullying .
It 's a big part of what we do .
And when someone who works for a public school system is found to be making really nasty comments about the " disease " that is gayness , we have no choice but to combat that .
The interest is to protect the children and teachers ( and combat bias in general ) , not harm Dr. Davis .
We are questioning why HE would want to harm us with such heated words against our lives and loves !
** UPDATE : We have been contacted by other employees , some of whom have been far more respectful of the situation than the above email .
** UPDATE 2 : We were just forwarded an email correspondence , in which yet another Mckinney staffer calls our posted information " false and inaccurate , " even though the ONLY possible back up they would have for this claim is Mr. Davis ' personal testimony .
And then this person went on to say that " The school district 's lawyers have been in contact with the owner of the site and are currently investigating the situation . "
This is a COMPLETE LIE .
The person who has contacted us under the pretense of legalese is a TECH PERSON !
While we respect that they would want to protect and defend their friend and colleague , we will not have them turning this around and misrepresenting this situation .
If Mr. Davis wants to prove that someone other than himself made the comments under his email address , we are going to need much more than anecdotal refutations made after the situation was brought to light !!!
*** UPDATE .
3/5 : McKinney , TX update [ G - A - Y ]
Your thoughts
you have every right to leave it up .
Do n't be intimidated .
Posted by : a. mcewen | Mar 3 , 2008 12:31:49 PM
Do n't worry .
Posted by : G - A - Y | Mar 3 , 2008 12:34:57 PM
Nice work , and definitely do n't back down .
I can only imagine how he 's abused his position in the past -- the least he deserves is to catch some heat for it this time .
Posted by : p. arsenault | Mar 3 , 2008 12:54:36 PM
One wonders how Davis came across this site in the first place .
Perhaps some of our friends in Texas who are no doubt reading today could elaborate on that .
They 're certainly not reading the science journals .
Posted by : Mad John | Mar 3 , 2008 1:09:40 PM
Well what really annoys me is the tone they are choosing to take over this .
This same sort of incident once happened involving a Chicago area teacher , and when it was brought to the attention of school officials , there concern was ( a ) the bias and ( b ) the usage of school email address .
Which is what it should be .
But instead of taking that route , this district is choosing to just accept Mr. Davis ' claim that he had nothing to do with this .
They have provided no evidence that would refute the evidence on our side , only his word .
And they are trying to run this around to make us look like the bullies , while threatening us with baseless claims ( defamation , improper usage . etc. ) !
It is more than a little disturbing .
Posted by : G - A - Y | Mar 3 , 2008 1:18:01 PM
I think it 's great that you stand up to these people .
I really like reading your blog knowing that not only are you keeping an eye on things but you are also willing to challenge people .
Thanks
Posted by : Kate | Mar 3 , 2008 2:13:16 PM
They wanted you to delete the comment while they were still " investigating " ?
How strange .
I find it equally strange that they did n't ask you to reveal the IP address the comment originated from as a part of the investigative process .
Or did you already provide that ?
I also find it curious that a technical person would start making legal threats .
As a rule , legal threats should be made by administrators and lawyers .
Posted by : Jarred | Mar 3 , 2008 2:40:42 PM
Jarred :
Well , there is no legal threat to be made .
We have done nothing wrong .
And it 's EXTREMELY insulting for them to turn this around , when all they are going on is his own claims that he did n't write it .
There is a slim chance that it could have originated from someone else close to him that had some sort of malice .
But look at the comment -- what would someone have to gain in doing so ?!
It 's not like a comment that would cause him great embarrassment .
It is simply a standard " pro-family " - like condemnation of homosexuality .
Posted by : G - A - Y | Mar 3 , 2008 2:51:22 PM
I just started reading your site recently -- and I have to say , you rock !
Keep up the good work .
Posted by : Laurie | Mar 3 , 2008 3:14:30 PM
Just a guess here : Dr. Davis thought that using his title and position would lend credibility to his comments .
When you called him on it , he realized that the school dept .
probably did n't much like a representative preaching bigotry on the web and panicked .
Rather than approach the school 's legal dept . , he asked a tech buddy to respond and deny and make threats .
If all of the above is more than a wild guess , I think Dr. Davis is not going to have a happy next couple of weeks .
Writing his opinion probably would n't hurt him much in McKinney , TX .
But lying about it and making legal claims that were not cleared by the legal dept .
could put him in some hot water .
Posted by : Timothy | Mar 3 , 2008 3:18:00 PM
G - A-Y : I agree with you .
I was merely pointing out some of the irregularities in the response you received .
These irregularities lead me to suspect , much like Timothy , that the technical person in question is a friend of or otherwise sympathetic towards Dr. Davis and acting of his own volition rather than communicating an " authorized " response from the school district .
Of course , if my suspicions are correct , said technician is on as much shaky grands as Dr. Davis .
After all , school district officials do n't care for it when unauthorized individuals tend to speak for them .
Posted by : Jarred | Mar 3 , 2008 3:30:37 PM
Jarred : Sorry , did n't make it to sound like I was disagreeing with you .
I was really just trying to build on what you had said .
Posted by : G - A - Y | Mar 3 , 2008 3:33:33 PM
Dude , you have the internet on your side , that school 's website server would fail to exist if any legal action was taken ... and on what grounds anyway ?
That some biggot from Texas got called out and now the entire district and children will find out ?
HAHA that 's what you get stupid ignorant ass .
Posted by : | Mar 3 , 2008 11:15:11 PM
" we have no choice but to combat that . "
Bull .
You made a choice .
It was the correct and moral one .
However please stop pretending your the unwitting tool of a greater force .
Standing up for principals you believe to be right is commendable .
Pretending that tracking someone 's email and notifying their boss had to be done , is false .
You went out of your way to hurt this person .
FACT .
You were right to do so .
My opinion .
Do n't play helpless .
Do n't play victim .
You got yourself into this .
Now kick their asses .
Because it serves your values .
Not because you have to .
Because it offends you that this prick is spreading bullsh*t from taxpayer resources .
Serve your principals , or fail .

If you want your comment removed from a website , do n't comment in the first place .
This , Dr. Davis , is called thinking before you act ; which is a virtue the taxpayers in Texas are paying you to instill in their children .
Keep fighting , Jeremy .
Posted by : Troy | Mar 4 , 2008 3:53:42 AM
I am definitely NOT a lawyer , but there was a ruling about using thumbnails that would seem to support your position Jeremy : http://www.law.duke.edu/journals/dltr/articles/2002dltr0006.html
Whether this applies in this case or not I have no idea .
As far as the comments he posted here , including his email address , along with the contact information at the school , the author of this letter to you does n't have a leg to stand on IMO .
Davis is a public official so any claims of privacy are negated .
In addition , because he is a public official the claim of defamation requires a higher standard since opinion , satire , etc. are fully allowed .
Of course , take all this as being the opinion of a complete layman ...
Posted by : John | Mar 4 , 2008 6:52:35 AM
Tony :
If you really think that we would go out of our way to hurt someone , then you are not familiar with this site .
We challenge messages , not people .
The goal is for anti-gay people to see the error in their line of logic and to come to a better place of understanding .
We do feel that combating bias like this IS something that we must do .
The site has been setup to challenge any and everyone 's anti-gay attitudes .
So when it falls right into our lap , we have no choice but to follow through .
That it what was meant by that comment .
Also , nobody went out of their way to track his email .
He gave his email .
Twice .
All it took was a simple Google search to find his position .
And again , considering what we do , it 'd almost impossible to ignore it when you find that such a nasty comment seemingly coming from someone in Dr. Davis ' position .
The interest is protecting the children , parents , teachers , etc. , and not hurting Dr. Davis .
Nobody is playing the victim here .
The only goal here is to get out the accurate information as it stands , and to combat the misrepresentations coming from a few within the school district .
Posted by : G - A - Y | Mar 4 , 2008 7:25:21 AM
John :
Well , the thumbnail thing is bullshit in many ways .
(a) Yes , there is precedent set that allows us to use thumbnail images that cannot be blown up to full size without depreciating the quality .
It 's the whole " good enough for Google " rule .
( b) We have a right to use such an image for highlighting our story .
It 's completely fair use .
( c) The graphic links back to its home on their site .
What are they claiming , that they have a copyright on a portion of their school district 's site ?
Fine .
Then they have to show that our usage was out of line and caused their product harm .
If anything , by linking directly back to the site , we have brought them traffic .
And we have made no disparaging remarks about the school system ( or even Davis himself , for that matter ) .
All we have done is presented the information that we have .
In terms of defamation : Well first off , he has to have genuinely had no part in writing the comment to have any basis .
We think that 's unlikely .
But even if he did n't write the comment , we have not made any defamatory claims about Dr. Davis .
We have presented exactly what appeared on our side , and connected the email address we were given back to his role at the school district .
And then we posted commentary about why this matter is of concern to us .
If you go back and read the post , you will see that we have left room for the possibility that Dr. Davis was the victim of a prank ( as unlikely as that seems ) .
Posted by : G - A - Y | Mar 4 , 2008 8:48:07 AM
The other thing to keep in mind is that the IT Acceptable Use Policy ( or IT policy ) limits the use of school resources for personal use .
One could argue that this posting by Dr. Davis has caused undue burden on the District 's computer resources .
See :
http://www.tasb.org/policy/pol/private/043907/pol.cfm?DisplayPage=CQ(LOCAL).pdf
Also , if Dr. Davis was to have left his computer unattended , and open to others to use , this could be a violation of other IT policies .
The irony is that Dr. Davis is most likely the person within the ISD that would have to investigate his abuse of the ISD policies :-)

I think you meant to reply to Tony ?
I hope .
Posted by : Troy | Mar 5 , 2008 1:20:04 AM
Oops .
Yea , the comment was meant for Tony , not you , Troy .
It 's been corrected .

No gasoline - powered car assembled in North America would meet China 's current fuel - efficiency standard .
Even vehicles produced under California 's proposed , and much praised , efficiency law – being fought tooth and nail by the U.S. and Canadian governments and the auto industry – would n't come close to the Chinese mileage limits .
If that 's a shock , take a deep breath .
There 's more .
The world 's most populous country – and one of its most - polluted – is racing to cut all sorts of emissions , including the greenhouse gases that cause climate change .
And any hope of getting the troubled Kyoto Protocol negotiations back on track comes in large part from China .
This is not the common wisdom about a place widely viewed as pillaging its environment in the name of economic growth and international status .
To be sure , China faces massive environmental problems :
For evidence , look no further than photos of Beijing 's impressive Olympic venues , their dazzling architecture obscured by thick smog .
The national government steamrolled opposition and common sense to build the monumental Three Gorges dam on the Yangtze River , ensuring ecological and human disaster .
China has overtaken the United States as Earth 's biggest spewer of greenhouse gases .
It 's opening new coal - fired generating stations at the rate of about one a week .
Still , it is doing far more than Canada , the U.S. or just about any other place to clean up its act .
It has begun to impose regulations and targets for car emissions , renewable fuels , carbon storage , forest renewal , energy efficiency and industrial pollution .
It 's investing heavily in new technologies , including " clean " coal and alternative power sources .
In many ways it 's putting us to shame .
Its successes have , so far , been overwhelmed by the sheer size of its economy , and its rapid growth .
As well , many people here simply refuse to see anything positive in the authoritarian powerhouse .
When it comes to climate change , China has always worn a black hat – with good reason .
Under the Kyoto Protocol , it was treated as a developing country and , so , was excused from taking on greenhouse gas targets .
It has argued , along with the rest of the world 's " poor " nations , that since it was n't responsible for climate change it should be allowed to grow rich in the same unsustainable way North America and Europe did .
And it has insisted that wealthy Europe , North America and Japan must clean up their act before it should be expected to do anything .
That line is partly true .
Much of China is abjectly poor , and its per capita greenhouse gas emissions are about one - seventh of Canada's .
On the other hand , it is , in total , growing very rich .
It 's now one of the world 's leading exporters and holds much of the United States ' massive debt .
That makes putting it in the same woebegone column as Congo or Zimbabwe patently ridiculous .
China seems to have finally acknowledged that it is , indeed , a big industrial and financial player .
At the recent United Nations conference on climate change , in Bali , it shifted from intransigent roadblock toward possible bridge .
The extent of the transformation became clearer this week at an Ottawa conference on the future of climate change action beyond 2012 .
The event , sponsored by the International Institute for Sustainable Development , was governed by " Chatham House " rules .
Under that system – named after the London research organization that invented it to promote open discussion – discussions can be reported , but no one can be quoted by name .
Experts there – Canadian and American researchers , including a representative from a high - level group that advises Beijing – said , quite simply , China has decided to build a low - carbon economy .
A couple of years ago , it was n't considered polite to even mention climate change :
Now , it 's embedded in the latest five - year plan , which calls for a 20 per cent improvement in energy efficiency by 2010 .
Some critics argue that , despite the apparently centralized government , the rhetoric from Beijing is far more impressive than the action on the ground , since many local officials still promote economic growth , or their bank accounts , at the expense of the environment .
And apart from the increasing number buying cars , the green movement does n't yet touch the average person .

Still , while it 's early days , and many of the plans are , for now , a dog 's breakfast , China is doing amazing things , one conference participant said .
Not surprisingly , although China wants to be seen as a good global citizen , the main push is self - interest .
This summer 's Olympics provided an immediate jolt .
China does n't want foul air to spoil its coming - out extravaganza .
On top of that , pollution is taking a terrible health toll :
It 's among the country 's leading causes of death .
Climate change threatens to eliminate glaciers on the Tibetan Plateau that are the major source of water for China and much of Asia .
Freak storms have unleashed death and economic destruction .
The car efficiency standards were inspired by looming fuel shortages and the soaring price of oil , which China must import .
And like forward thinkers here , Chinese leaders are also convinced there 's gold in green .
They dominate world trade in conventional exports .
Why not in clean technology , too ?
For a start , China will soon introduce low - cost solar panels that are expected to take over the global market .
China also appears ready to be helpful with the next round of talks on emission targets .
Under the agreement reached at Bali , targets are to be negotiated by the end of next year and come into effect in 2012 .
But that deal was a weak compromise , cobbled together just so the marathon conference would n't be viewed as a failure .
With 200 nations divided into bickering groups , and complex issues to sort out , prospects for meeting the deadline are dim .
The key impasse is that the United States , backed by Canada , insists China accept commitments before it will move .
China has given signs it will act , but wants a signal from the United States before it will go as far as it can .
That could come soon after George W. Bush leaves office , since all three of the remaining presidential contenders support action on climate change .
The other message , though , is that China wo n't thump its chest about any of this .
It does n't want to be seen as a leader :
It prefers stealth .
We 're in for a diplomatic dance that 's well worth watching with an open mind .

It is 2 am and the all - weekend beach party is in full swing .
DJs turn tables as girls in bikinis rave to the drum 'n ' bass beat and revellers sprawl on silky white sands .
This is the paradise beach of Fujairah , a purpose - built island off Dubai , where , increasingly , the world 's revellers – and especially the UK 's revellers – convene to let their hair down .
The parties are drawing a growing number of hedonistic Britons who eschew such downmarket destinations as Ayia Napa and Faliraki in favour of the more upmarket but surprisingly affordable pleasures of Dubai , with its luxury hotels and cheap weekend package deals .
But what many may not realise is that the Gulf 's premier party state has a " zero tolerance " drugs policy .
A growing number of British tourists have felt the full force of Islamic law for carrying even tiny quantities of drugs .
The Labour peer Lord Ahmed is currently assisting the families of eight men under the age of 30 who have been arrested for alleged drug offences in Dubai .
In today 's Eastern Eye newspaper Lord Ahmed warns young visitors not to treat a holiday to Dubai with the same casual hedonism as a trip to Ibiza , and to avoid any " illicit " behaviour while they are on beach holidays there .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Addressing the one million British tourists , many of them Asians , who visit the Gulf state every year , he says that travellers should not forget that they are entering a country with very strict drugs laws .
" My plea to parents is to ensure firstly that young children are not taking drugs ...
And do n't go to the Middle East countries as there is a zero tolerance towards drugs .
" The men [ detained ] are mainly from Lancashire and Yorkshire .
They were caught by a drug - scanning machine with the drugs in their pockets or in their socks .
They are from decent families , some in business , who have done really well .
They can be in a cell for months as a conviction does n't happen overnight .
In one particular case , the prosecution is asking every month for extra time , resulting in longer delays in the case . "
The British - Pakistani men were allegedly caught with small amounts of cannabis or heroin .
One of them , a 25 - year - old who asked to be named only as Awaab , was arrested at Dubai airport last month for carrying cannabis .
Carrying cannabis , however small the quantity , carries a blanket sentence of four years in the UAE .
Ashwin Mehra , 24 , a British Indian who worked for a finance publishing company in Dubai for four months last year , said he was surprised to be stopped at Dubai airport for having a pharmaceutical medicine .
" I had the flu so I had medicine with codeine in it , which they took from me .
I have known people who had Night Nurse with them who have faced problems too .
We in the West do not perceive things from an Arab point of view , " he said .
While he enjoyed Dubai 's party scene , he was concerned for those who flouted Islamic laws .
" I had worked on the Greek islands before I went to Dubai so I 'd seen that party scene .
Dubai has a huge Western influence and is globalised with lots of bars , beach parties and nightclubs .
But it also has Islamic laws , and if you put a foot wrong you might not be coming home .
" I saw some groups of young people that had more money than sense .
I saw some drugs out there , although I was never involved .
There were some people who smoked marijuana , which is taking a stupid risk .
I 've been with a group of people acting a bit silly because they were drunk who ended up spending four days in a prison cell .
" I can see the allure of Dubai .
It has the most amazing white sandy beaches and man-made islands devoted to tourists and beach parties .
But at the same time , visitors have to learn to behave in a certain way , " he said .

A Foreign Office spokeswoman said nine British nationals have been detained in Dubai in 2008 so far .
Simon Goldsmith , spokesman for the British embassy in Dubai , added that 57 Britons were detained on drug- related charges in 2007 .
" The UAE has severe penalties for drug offences and an absolute zero tolerance .
We strongly advise people to check our travel advice before they travel .
We offer a 24/7 service where we can advise on local procedures and provide a list of local lawyers who cover a range of issues .
What we cannot do is intervene in the local legal process . "
Catherine Wolthuizen , chief executive of Fair Trials International , which has issued travel warnings , said customs authorities in the country were using sensitive new equipment to conduct the most thorough searches on visitors .
" So many people now travel to Dubai and , as we 're seeing , many have no idea what risks they 're taking or their vulnerability to this very strict approach , " she said .
" What many travellers may not realise is that they can be deemed to be in possession of such banned substances if they can be detected in their urine or bloodstream , or even in tiny , trace amounts on their person . "
The US embassy in Dubai has issued a warning that even having poppy seeds which are used for cooking in some countries , could lead to a prison sentence .
This week , a senior judge in Dubai welcomed the warnings issued to visitors .
Judge Ali Al - Kaladari told the English - language paper , 7 Days , that the strict laws were designed as a deterrent .
" These laws help discourage anyone from carrying or using drugs .
Even if the amount of illegal drugs found on someone is 0.05 grams , they will be found guilty , " he said , adding that the penalty for dealing in illegal drugs was life in jail or even the death sentence .
Some have suggested it may be the growing hedonism in the state that has led officials to become more vigilant towards Westerners .
High - profile " party people " such as Kate Moss and Puff Daddy have visited Dubai while some celebrities have even bought property there .
Dubai 's transformation from a tiny Islamic outpost into a vibrant , relatively liberal Gulf state inhabited by large numbers of expatriates and tourists has helped create an economic boom but may have left local people feeling besieged or threatened .
The oil - rich state has maximised its reputation as a party state by creating " Westernised " districts such as Jumeriah .
In Arab countries , anyone wanting to buy alcohol must first buy a licence .
But the large seven - star hotels already have licences and incorporate nightclubs and bars within their premises .
The beaches are filled with women who wear bikinis by day and skimpy outfits by night .
The indigenous Arab community , meanwhile , resides in far - removed districts such as Shahja , where women often wear headscarves and the call for prayer is a prominent feature in daily life .
Last year , a spate of incidents involving Westerners carrying recreational drugs included a British tourist , Keith Brown , who was arrested for possession of 0.003 grams of cannabis – less than the weight of a grain of sugar – and was jailed for four years .
Bert Tatham , a Canadian UN anti-narcotics official who advised the Afghan government on its fight against opium , was jailed for four years after 0.5 grams of hashish and two poppy seeds were found in his possession , although he was later pardoned .
The courts in Dubai are currently dealing with cases involving the Radio One DJ Raymond Bingham , also known as Grooverider , who was allegedly caught with just over two grams of cannabis ; and a British television executive who was arrested last week for possessing cannabis .
Grooverider had been due to perform at a club gig and was quoted in local press reports as telling a court that he had forgotten he had a small amount of the drug in his pocket .
In 2006 , the hip hop producer Dallas Austin was sentenced to four years after he was found with 1.26 grams of cocaine and other banned substances .
The 34 - year - old composer had flown to Dubai for a three - day birthday party thrown by the supermodel Naomi Campbell .
He was later pardoned after intense lobbying from US senators with business ties in the region , and from the singer , Lionel Ritchie , a cult figure in the Arab world .
As this month welcomes in 2008 's party season in Dubai , anyone tempted to light up a joint at a beach party or to smuggle in some cannabis should understand that they are taking a tremendous risk .
" Dubai is quite a free society in terms of the Middle East , " said one Irish woman who lives there and did not want to be named .
" But in UK terms , it is fairly conservative .
" When people think some drug - taking will be tolerated there , they are either being naïve , arrogant or stupid . "
Build a custom search engine with PHP
Sphinx indexes your content , finds text fast , and provides useful search results
In the Internet age , people want information packaged like fast food : served instantly , hassle - free , and in bite - size ( or is that byte - size ? ) morsels .
Indeed , to feed the impatient and hungry masses , even the most modest Web site is now expected to serve a diverse menu of fast - fact formats :
RSS is your pizza guy , bringing fresh - baked data right to your door .
The weblog is your local Chinese take - out , delivering your favorite spicy dish .
The forum is the neighborhood potluck ( or perhaps more aptly , the food fight scene in " Animal House " ) .
And search is like all - you - can - eat night at your local cafeteriaplex : Just fill up your plate with anything your heart desires , time and again , so long as your gullet — and your chair — hold up .
Luckily , PHP developers can find a wide variety of RSS , blog , and forum software to create or amend a site .
And while Google and others are virtually omniscient and do funnel traffic , the search engines are n't necessarily well suited to every site .
For example , if your Web site offers hundreds of thousands of new and refurbished Porsche parts , Google may turn up your site for a broad search such as " Carrera parts , " but it may not yield an accurate result for the more specific " used 1991 Porsche 911 Targa headlight bezel " inquiry .
If your content is highly specialized or your visitors expect your search feature to parallel real - world workflow , it 's best to augment the Web 's global search engines with a local search system tailored to your site .
( See " A needle in a billion haystacks " for more instances of specialized search . )
Discover how to add a fast , capable , open source , and free search engine to a PHP site .
Little of the visible Web site is developed here .
Instead , the focus is on the components required to deliver effective search results : the database , the index , the search engine , and the PHP application program interface ( API ) .
Visit the great sphinx
To provide a custom search feature for your site , you must have a data source and the ability to search that source .
For a Web application , the data source is commonly a relational database , which has some forms of search built in .
( Equality is a simple search operator , as is the SQL operator LIKE .)
Yet , some searches may be more specialized than the database can perform , or a search may be so complicated that the inherent SQL JOIN s are simply too slow .
A needle in a billion haystacks
Many sites provide content specific to an industry , vocation , or pastime , such as medicine , law , music , and auto maintenance .
Delving into such content may require special tools or training , or it may simply require a singular index to generate relevant and practical results .
Here are some common search scenarios that require a tailor - made search system : Find all articles about the Stanley Cup written by a Joe Hockey .
Find the latest drivers for the HP LaserJet 3015 All - in - One printer .
Find the footage of Dinosaur Jr.'s , performance from the Late Show With David Letterman .
To speed searches , you may be able to rearrange your tables and , thus , simplify the underlying queries .
( Table and SQL query optimization are highly dependent on your schema and engine .
Search online to find a vast number of articles and books dedicated to database performance . )
Alternatively , you can add a specialized search engine .
Which search engine to apply also depends on the form ( and quantity ) of your data and your budget .
Many options are available :
You can connect a Google appliance to your network , purchase Endeca or another large - scale commercial search product , or try Lucene .
But in many cases , commercial products are overkill or squander an operating budget , and Lucene did not offer a PHP API when this was written in July 2007 .
As an alternative , consider Sphinx , which is an open source and free ( as in speech and beer ) search engine designed to search text extremely quickly .
For instance , on a live database of nearly 300,000 rows of five indexed columns , where each column contains about 15 words , Sphinx can yield a result for an " any of these words " search in 1/100th of a second ( on a 2 - GHz AMD Opteron processor with 1 GB of RAM running Debian Linux® Sarge ) .
Sphinx has a raft of features , including :
It can index any data you can represent as a string .
It can index the same data in different ways .
With multiple indexes , each tuned for a specific purpose , you can choose the most appropriate index to optimize search results .
It can associate attributes with each piece of indexed data .
You can then use one or more of the attributes to further filter search results .
It supports morphology , so a search for the word " cats " also finds the root word " cat . "
You can distribute a Sphinx index among many machines , providing failover .
It can create indexes of word prefixes of arbitrary length and indexes of infix substrings of varying lengths .
For instance , a part number may be 10 characters wide .
The prefix index would match against all possible substrings anchored at the start of the string .
The infix index would match substrings anywhere within the string .
You can run it as a storage engine within MySQL V5 , alleviating the need for yet another daemon , which is often viewed as an additional point of failure .
You can find a complete list of features online and in the README file distributed with the Sphinx source code .
The Sphinx Web site also lists several projects that have deployed Sphinx .
Sphinx is written in C++ , builds with the GNU compilers , supports 64 - bit on capable platforms , and runs on Linux , UNIX® , Microsoft ® Windows ® , and Mac OS X. Building Sphinx is simple : Download and extract the code , then run the command ./ configure && make && make install .
By default , Sphinx utilities are installed in /usr / local / bin / , and the configuration file for all the Sphinx components is /usr / local / etc/sphinx.conf .
Sphinx has three components : an index generator , a search engine , and a command - line search utility :
The index generator is called indexer .
It queries your database , indexes each column in each row of the result , and ties each index entry to the row 's primary key .
The search engine is a daemon called searchd .
The daemon receives search terms and other parameters , scours one or more indices , and returns a result .
If a match is made , searchd returns an array of primary keys .
Given those keys , an application can run a query against the associated database to find the complete records that comprise the match .
Searchd communicates to applications through a socket connection on port 3312 .
The handy search utility lets you conduct searches from the command line without writing code .
If searchd returns a match , search queries the database and displays the rows in the match set .
The search utility is useful for debugging your Sphinx configuration and performing impromptu searches .
In addition , the author of Sphinx , Andrew Aksyonoff , and other contributors provide APIs for PHP , Perl , C/C++ , and other programming languages .
Search for body parts
Assume Body - Parts.com sells auto body parts — fenders , chrome , bumpers , etc. — for rare and collectible cars .
As in the real world , a visitor to the Body Parts site is likely to search for parts by manufacturer ( say , Porsche or a third party that makes equivalents ) , part number , make , model , year , condition ( used , new , refurbished ) , and description , or some combination of those properties .
To build the Body Parts search feature , let 's use MySQL V5.0 as the data store and the Sphinx search daemon to provide fast and accurate text search .
MySQL V5.0 is a capable database , but its enhanced full - text search feature is n't especially rich .
In fact , it 's limited to MyISAM tables — a table format that does n't support foreign keys and , thus , may be of limited use .
Listings 1 through 4 show the portion of the Body Parts schema relevant to this example .
You see the Model ( Listing 1 ) , Assembly ( Listing 2 ) , Inventory ( Listing 3 ) , and Schematic ( Listing 4 ) tables , respectively .
The Model table
The Model table shown in Listing 1 is simple :
The label column enumerates the name of a model ( " Corvette " ) ; description acts as a consumer - friendly portrait of the auto ( " Two - door roadster ; first year of introduction " ) ; and begin_production and end_production denote the years in which production of the version began and ended , respectively .
Because the values in the aforementioned columns are not unique , a separate ID represents each quadruple ( label , description , begin_production , end_production ) and is a foreign key in other tables .
Listing 1 . Body Parts Model table
CREATE TABLE Model ( id int ( 10 ) unsigned NOT NULL auto_increment , label varchar ( 7 ) NOT NULL , description varchar ( 256 ) NOT NULL , begin_production int(4 ) NOT NULL , end_production int(4 ) NOT NULL , PRIMARY KEY ( id ) ) ENGINE=InnoDB ;
Here 's some sample data for the Model table :
INSERT INTO Model ( `id` , `label` , `description` , `begin_production` , `end_production` ) VALUES ( 1 , 'X Sedan ' , ' Four - door performance sedan ',1998,1999 ) , ( 3 , 'X Sedan ' , 'Four door performance sedan , 1st model year ',1995,1997 ) , ( 4 , 'J Convertible ' , 'Two - door roadster , metal retracting roof ', 2002,2005 ) , ( 5 , 'J Convertible ' , 'Two - door roadster ', 2000,2001 ) , ( 7 , 'W Wagon ' , ' Four - door , all - wheel drive sport station wagon ' , 2007,0 ) ;
The Assembly table
An assembly is a subsystem , such as the transmission or all the glass found on an auto .
Owners consult an assembly drawing and associated parts list to find replacement parts .
The Assembly table , shown in Listing 2 , is also simple :
It associates a unique ID with an assembly label and description .
Listing 2 . The Assembly table
CREATE TABLE Assembly ( id int ( 10 ) unsigned NOT NULL auto_increment , label varchar ( 7 ) NOT NULL , description varchar ( 128 ) NOT NULL , PRIMARY KEY ( id ) ) ENGINE=InnoDB ;
To continue , here 's some sample data for the Assembly table :
INSERT INTO Assembly ( `id` , `label` , `description` ) VALUES ( 1, ' 5 - 00 ' , 'Seats ' ) , ( 2, '4-00 ' , 'Electrical ' ) , ( 3, '3-00 ' , 'Glasses ' ) , ( 4, '2-00 ' , 'Frame ' ) , ( 5, ' 1-00 ' , 'Engine ' ) , ( 7, '101-00 ' , 'Accessories ' ) ;
The Inventory table
The Inventory table is the canonical list of car parts .
A part — such as a bolt or a bulb — might be in every car made and in multiple assemblies , but the part appears but once in the Inventory table .
Each row in the Inventory table contains :
A unique 32 - bit integer serialno used to identify the row .
An alphanumeric part number .
( This part number is unique and could suffice as the primary key .
However , because it can contain alphanumeric characters , it 's inappropriate for use with Sphinx , which requires each record indexed to have a unique 32 - bit integer key . )
A text description .
A price .
The specification for the Inventory table is shown in Listing 3 .
Listing 3 . The Inventory table
CREATE TABLE Inventory ( id int ( 10 ) unsigned NOT NULL auto_increment , partno varchar ( 32 ) NOT NULL , description varchar ( 256 ) NOT NULL , price float unsigned NOT NULL default ' 0 ' , PRIMARY KEY ( id ) , UNIQUE KEY partno USING BTREE ( partno ) ) ENGINE=InnoDB ;
A ( partial ) list of parts might look as follows :
INSERT INTO `Inventory` ( `id` , `partno` , `description` , `price` ) VALUES ( 1 , 'WIN408 ' , 'Portal window ' , 423 ) , ( 2, 'ACC711 ' , ' Jack kit ' , 110 ) , ( 3 , 'ACC43 ' , ' Rear - view mirror ' , 55 ) , ( 4 , 'ACC5409 ' , 'Cigarette lighter ' , 20 ) , ( 5 , 'WIN958 ' , ' Windshield , front ',500 ) , ( 6,'765432 ' , ' Bolt ' , 0.1 ) , ( 7, 'ENG001 ' , 'Entire engine ' , 10000 ) , ( 8, 'ENG088 ' , 'Cylinder head ' ,55 ) , ( 9 , 'ENG976 ' , 'Large cylinder head ' ,65 ) ;
The Schematic table
The Schematic table ties parts to assemblies and model versions .
Hence , you 'd use the Schematic table to find all parts that compose the engine in a 1979 J Class convertible .
Each row in the Schematic table has a unique ID , a foreign key that refers to a row in the Inventory table , a foreign key that identifies the assembly , and another key to refer to a specific model and version in the Model table .
The rows are shown in Listing 4 .
Listing 4 . The Schematic table
CREATE TABLE Schematic ( id int ( 10 ) unsigned NOT NULL auto_increment , partno_id int ( 10 ) unsigned NOT NULL , assembly_id int ( 10 ) unsigned NOT NULL , model_id int ( 10 ) unsigned NOT NULL , PRIMARY KEY ( id ) , KEY partno_index USING BTREE ( partno_id ) , KEY assembly_index USING BTREE ( assembly_id ) , KEY model_index USING BTREE ( model_id ) , FOREIGN KEY ( partno_id ) REFERENCES Inventory ( id ) , FOREIGN KEY ( assembly_id ) REFERENCES Assembly ( id ) , FOREIGN KEY ( model_id ) REFERENCES Model( id ) ) ENGINE=InnoDB ;
To reinforce the purpose of the table , here 's a small list of rows from Schematic :
INSERT INTO `Schematic` ( `id` , `partno_id` , `assembly_id` , `model_id` ) VALUES ( 1,6,5,1 ) , ( 2,8,5,1 ) , ( 3,1,3,1 ) , ( 4,5,3,1 ) , ( 5,8,5,7 ) , ( 6,6,5,7 ) , ( 7,4,7,3 ) , ( 8,9,5,3 ) ;
Searching with the tables
With these tables defined , a good many searches can easily be answered :
Show all versions of a specific model
List all assemblies required to assemble a particular model and version
Show all parts in a particular assembly for a specific model and version
But a handful of searches are particularly costly :
Find all occurrences of parts in any model and version with part numbers that begin with " WIN "
Find those parts that have " lacquer " or " paint " in the description
Find all the parts with " black leather " in the description
Find all the 2002 J Series parts with " paint " in the description
Each of these searches could require voluminous JOIN s or expensive LIKE clauses , especially if the Inventory and Schematic tables are large .
Further , complex text searches are simply beyond MySQL 's capabilities .
To search vast quantities of text data , consider building and using a Sphinx index .
Integrate the Sphinx software
To apply Sphinx to a problem , you must define one or more sources and one or more indexes .
A source identifies the database to index , provides authentication information , and defines the query to use to construct each row .
Optionally , a source can identify one or more columns as a filter , or what Sphinx calls a group .
You use groups to filter results .
For example , the word paint might yield 900 matches .
If you 're only interested in matches for a specific model car , you can further filter using the model group .
An index requires a source ( that is , a set of rows ) and defines how the data extracted from the source should be cataloged .
You define your source (s ) and index ( es ) in the sphinx .
conf file .
The source for Body Parts is a MySQL database .
Listing 5 shows part of the definition of the source named catalog — the snippet specifies which database to connect to and how to make a connection ( host , socket , user , and password ) .
Listing 5 . Settings to access the MySQL database
source catalog { type = mysql sql_host = localhost sql_user = reaper sql_pass = s3cr3t sql_db = body_parts sql_sock =
/var/run/ mysqld/mysqld.sock sql_port = 3306
Next , create a query to produce rows to be indexed .
Typically , you create a SELECT statement , perhaps JOIN ing many tables together to yield a row .
Here , though , there 's a problem : A search for model and year must use the Assembly table , but the part number and part description can only be found in the Inventory table .
To work , Sphinx must be able to tie a search result to a 32 - bit integer primary key .
To get the data in the right form , create a view — a new construct in MySQL V5 that assembles columns from other tables into a single , composite virtual table .
Using a view , all the data needed for every kind of search is in one place , even though the live data actually lives in other tables .
Listing 6 shows the SQL to define the view named Catalog .
Listing 6 . Catalog view assembles data into virtual table
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW Catalog AS SELECT Inventory.id , Inventory .
partno , Inventory .
description , Assembly.id AS assembly , Model.id AS model FROM Assembly , Inventory , Model , Schematic WHERE Schematic.partno_id=Inventory.id AND Schematic.model_id=Model.id AND Schematic.assembly_id=Assembly.id ;
If you create a database named body_parts with the tables and data shown previously , your Catalog view should resemble this :
mysql > use body_parts ; Database changed mysql > select * from Catalog ; +----+---------+---------------------+----------+-------+ | id | partno | description | assembly | model |
+----+---------+---------------------+----------+-------+ | 6 | 765432 | Bolt | 5 | 1 | | 8 | ENG088 | Cylinder head | 5 | 1 | | 1 | WIN408 | Portal window | 3 | 1 | | 5 | WIN958 | Windshield , front | 3 | 1 | | 4 | ACC5409 | Cigarette lighter | 7 | 3 | | 9 | ENG976 | Large cylinder head | 5 | 3 | | 8 | ENG088 | Cylinder head | 5 | 7 | | 6 | 765432 | Bolt | 5 | 7 | +----+---------+---------------------+----------+-------+ 8 rows in set ( 0.00 sec )
In the view , the field id points back to the part 's entry in the Inventory table .
The partno and description columns are the essential text to search , and the assembly and model columns serve as groups to further filter results .
With the view in place , constructing the source query is a snap .
Listing 7 shows the rest of the definition of the source named catalog .
Listing 7 .
A query to create rows to be indexed
# indexer query # document_id MUST be the very first field # document_id MUST be positive ( non-zero , non-negative ) # document_id MUST fit into 32 bits # document_id MUST be unique sql_query = \ SELECT \ id , partno , description , \ assembly , model \ FROM \ Catalog ; sql_group_column = assembly sql_group_column = model # document info query # ONLY used by search utility to display document information # MUST be able to fetch document info by its id , therefore # MUST contain ' $ id ' macro # sql_query_info = SELECT * FROM Inventory WHERE id =$id }
The sql_query must include the primary key you want to use for subsequent lookups , and it must include all the fields you want to index and use as groups .
The two sql_group_column entries declare that Assembly and Model can be used to filter results .
And the search utility uses sql_query_info to find the records that match .
In the query , $id is replaced with each primary key that searchd returns .
The last configuration step is to build an index .
Listing 8 shows an index for the source catalog .
Listing 8 .
Describing one possible index for the source named catalog
index catalog { source = catalog path = / var / data / sphinx / catalog morphology = stem_en min_word_len = 3 min_prefix_len = 0 min_infix_len = 3 }
Line 1 points to a named source in the sphinx .
conf file .
Line 2 defines where to store the index data ; by convention , Sphinx indices are stored in / var / data / sphinx .
Line 3 allows the index to use English morphology .
And lines 5 - 7 tell the indexer to index only those words of three characters or more and to create an infix index of every substring of three characters or more .
( For easy reference , Listing 9 shows the entire example sphinx .conf file for Body Parts . )
Listing 9 .
The example sphinx.conf for Body Parts
source catalog { type = mysql sql_host = localhost sql_user = reaper sql_pass = s3cr3t sql_db = body_parts sql_sock =
/var/run/ mysqld/mysqld.sock sql_port = 3306 # indexer query # document_id MUST be the very first field # document_id MUST be positive ( non-zero , non-negative ) # document_id MUST fit into 32 bits # document_id MUST be unique sql_query = \ SELECT \ id , partno , description , \ assembly , model \ FROM \ Catalog ; sql_group_column = assembly sql_group_column = model # document info query # ONLY used by search utility to display document information # MUST be able to fetch document info by its id , therefore # MUST contain ' $ id ' macro # sql_query_info = SELECT * FROM
Inventory WHERE id =$id } index catalog { source = catalog path = / var / data / sphinx / catalog morphology = stem_en min_word_len = 3 min_prefix_len = 0 min_infix_len = 3 } searchd { port = 3312 log =
/var/log/searchd/searchd.log query_log = /var/log/searchd/query.log pid_file = /var/log/searchd/searchd.pid }
The searchd section at bottom configures the searchd daemon itself .
The entries in that section should be self - explanatory .
The query.log is especially useful :
It shows each search as it's run and displays results , such as the number of documents searched and the total number of matches .
Build and test the index
You are now ready to build the index for the Body Parts application .
To do so :
Create the directory hierarchy / var / data / sphinx by typing : $ sudo mkdir -p / var / data / sphinx Assuming that MySQL is running , run indexer to create the indices by using the code shown below .
Listing 10 .
Create the indexes $ sudo /usr / local / bin / indexer -- config /usr / local/etc/sphinx.conf -- all Sphinx 0.9.7 Copyright ( c ) 2001 - 2007 , Andrew Aksyonoff using config file '/usr/local/etc/sphinx.conf '... indexing index ' catalog '... collected 8 docs , 0.0 MB sorted 0.0 Mhits , 82.8 % done total 8 docs , 149 bytes total 0.010 sec , 14900.00 bytes/sec , 800.00 docs/sec Note :
The - all argument rebuilds all the indexes listed in sphinx .conf .
You can use a different argument to rebuild fewer if you do n't need to rebuild every index .
You can now test the index with the search utility using the code shown below .
( You do n't need searchd running to use search . )
Listing 11 .
Test the index with search $ /usr/ local / bin/ search -- config /usr/local/etc/sphinx.conf
ENG Sphinx 0.9.7 Copyright ( c ) 2001 - 2007 , Andrew Aksyonoff index ' catalog ' : query ' ENG ' : returned 2 matches of 2 total in 0.000 sec displaying matches : 1 . document=8 , weight=1 , assembly=5 , model=7 id=8 partno=ENG088 description =Cylinder head price=55 2 . document=9 , weight=1 , assembly=5 , model=3 id=9 partno=ENG976 description =Large cylinder head price=65 words : 1. 'eng ' : 2 documents , 2 hits $ /usr/local/ bin/search --config /usr/local/etc/sphinx.conf wind Sphinx 0.9.7 Copyright ( c ) 2001 - 2007 , Andrew Aksyonoff index ' catalog ' : query ' wind ' : returned 2 matches of 2 total in 0.000 sec displaying matches : 1 . document=1 , weight=1 , assembly=3 , model=1 id=1 partno=WIN408 description =Portal window price=423 2 . document=5 , weight=1 , assembly=3 , model=1 id=5 partno=WIN958 description =Windshield , front price=500 words : 1 . ' wind ' : 2 documents , 2 hits $ /usr/local/bin/search \ -- config /usr/local/etc/sphinx.conf
-- filter model 3 ENG Sphinx 0.9.7 Copyright ( c ) 2001 - 2007 , Andrew Aksyonoff index ' catalog ' : query ' ENG ' : returned 1 matches of 1 total in 0.000 sec displaying matches : 1 . document=9 , weight=1 , assembly=5 , model=3 id=9 partno=ENG976 description =Large cylinder head price=65 words : 1. 'eng ' : 2 documents , 2 hits
The first command , /usr / local / bin/ search -- config /usr / local/etc/sphinx.conf ENG , found the two occurrences of ENG in part numbers .
The second command , /usr / local / bin/ search -- config /usr / local/etc/sphinx.conf wind , found the substring wind in two part descriptions .
And the third command restricted the results to those entries in which model is 3 .
Write the code
At long last , you can now write PHP code to call the Sphinx search engine .
The Sphinx PHP API is small and easy to master .
Listing 12 is a small PHP application to call searchd to extract the same results of the last command shown above ( " find all parts with ' cylinder ' in the name that belong to model 3 " ) .
Listing 12 .
Calling the Sphinx search engine from PHP
<?php include ( ' sphinx -0.9.7/api/sphinxapi.php ' ) ; $ cl = new SphinxClient ( ) ; $ cl->SetServer ( " localhost " , 3312 ) ; $ cl->SetMatchMode ( SPH_MATCH_ANY ) ; $ cl->SetFilter ( ' model ' , array ( 3 ) ) ; $ result = $ cl -> Query ( ' cylinder ' , ' catalog ' ) ; if ( $ result === false ) { echo " Query failed : " . $ cl->GetLastError ( ) . " .
" ; } else { if ( $ cl->GetLastWarning ( ) ) { echo " WARNING : " . $ cl->GetLastWarning ( ) . "
" ; } if ( ! empty ( $ result [ " matches " ] ) ) { foreach ( $ result [ " matches " ] as $ doc => $ docinfo ) { echo " $doc
" ; } print_r ( $ result ) ; } } exit ; ?>
To test the code , create the log directory for Sphinx , start searchd , then run the PHP application , as shown below .
Listing 13 .
The PHP application
$ sudo mkdir -p / var / log / searchd $ sudo /usr / local / bin/ searchd -- config /usr / local/etc/sphinx.conf $ php search.
php 9 Array ( [ fields ] => Array ( [ 0 ] => partno [ 1 ] => description ) [ attrs ] =>
Array ( [ assembly ] => 1 [ model ] => 1 ) [ matches ] => Array ( [ 9 ] =>
Array ( [ weight ] => 1 [ attrs ] =>
Array ( [ assembly ] => 5 [ model ] => 3 ) ) ) [ total ] => 1 [ total_found ] => 1 [ time ] => 0.000 [ words ] =>
Array ( [ cylind ] =>
Array ( [ docs ] => 2 [ hits ] => 2 ) ) )
The output is 9 : the correct primary key of the sole row that matches .
If Sphinx makes a match , the associative array $ result contains an element named results .
Glance though the output of print_r ( ) to see what else is returned .
One mention : total_found is the total number of matches found in the index , and found is the number of results returned .
The two may differ because you can change how many matches are returned each time and which batch of matches to return , which is useful for paginating long lists of results .
See the API call SetLimits ( ) .
One example of pagination is to call the search engine with : $ cl->SetLimits ( ( $ page - 1 ) * SPAN , SPAN ) to return the first , second , third ( etc. ) batch of SPAN matches , depending on which page is to be displayed .
Explore the mysteries of the Sphinx
Sphinx has many more features to take advantage of .
I 've barely scratched the surface here , but you now have a working real - world example to build on to expand your expertise .
Peruse the sample Sphinx configuration file , /usr / local/etc/sphinx.conf.dist , that ships with the distribution .
The comments in that file explain what each Sphinx parameter can do ; show how to create a distributed , redundant configuration ; and explain how to inherit base settings to avoid repetition in sources and indexes .
The Sphinx README file is also a great source of information , including how to embed Sphinx directly into MySQL V5 — no daemons required .
Next time , search for better solutions than echo ( ) and print_r ( ) to debug PHP code .

Unfortunately , this is a question that falls well beyond the scope of one simple writeup — indeed , one could fill E2's entire database with opinions , ideas , and testimonials about this subject without much of a chance of ever really reaching the " correct " answer ( much less a consensus of opinions ! ) .
After all , parents are going to parent their children however they deem fit , regardless of what a bunch of eggheads on some Internet site have to say about it .
For that reason , I want to focus on a smaller piece of the puzzle .
In this writeup , I will be assuming a premise I believe most people will accept , that is : adults can be , and often are , harmed by ignorance .
Assuming this notion that a lack of knowledge in and of itself can be harmful to adults , I hope to argue that this can very much be the case ( in fact , even more so ) with children .
The discussion will center around one simple concept / question :
To what extent should children be protected from the " real world ? "
I should point out that this writeup attempts to walk a fine line between being labeled " duh , well , that 's obvious " and " good lord , he 's advocating anarchy ! "
To avoid starting off on the wrong foot , let 's take a quick moment and examine what I am not arguing :
So what in the hell are you saying , Springs ?
Excellent question .
My general concern in this writeup is for the situation in which a child is harmed by a parent 's natural instinct to " protect " them from the world .
That is to say :
In many cases , children who are " protected " from one thing or another suffer unintended — yet quite avoidable — negative consequences .
It is my argument that when parents keep secrets from their children " for their own good , " they may actually be robbing them of something vital ( knowledge ) that , as a result , indirectly harms them ... despite the parents ' best intentions .
Uncle Steve was n't officially my uncle ; he was actually my godparent .
But as is the case with most Southern families , we do n't commonly walk around calling folks " Godfather " or " Godmother " unless we 're in the mafia ( which , for the most part , we were n't ) .
Besides ,
Steve and his wife were always very nice to my sister and me — much more so than any of our " real " aunts and uncles — so as far as I 'm concerned , he very much earned that title .
Since I was so young when he died , I barely remember anything about him .
I know he was a gentle and compassionate man .
I remember that he 's the one who taught me how to play " chopsticks " on the piano .
I know he loved his wife very much ; and I know that when he died , it pretty much killed her , too .
When Steve got sick , my parents told my sister and I that he had pneumonia .
We were n't taken to see him while he was in the hospital , nor were allowed to attend the wake or the funeral .
Ostensibly , this was because it would have been hard for us children to see a close friend die ( which undoubtedly would have been the case ) , but truthfully , they were shielding us from the doctors , family members , friends — anyone who might have accidentally let slip the truth about the circumstances of his passing .
I would n't learn the truth about Steve 's illness for almost ten years .
It was n't such a difficult ruse to pull off , actually .
Around that same time , Jim Henson , a celebrity close to most gen-xers ' hearts , had died at a relatively young age of a respiratory illness .
So the concept of a healthy man in his twenties rapidly deteriorating and subsequently dying of pneumonia was n't that difficult of a concept to swallow ... especially for an eight year old who still believed in Santa Claus .
As the years passed , my tiny adolescent mind would occasionally pick up on clues that suggested there was more to Steve 's death than I had been told .
The most palpable example comes from when I was about eleven or twelve years old and a trip to the family doctor revealed ( and I believe I can quote this almost exactly ) , my runny nose and sore throat were " nothing too serious , just a bit of bronchitis and maybe the beginnings of pneumonia . "
I wonder if my parents ever explained to the doctor why I suddenly ( and inexplicably ) started freaking out in his office , totally convinced that I was on the verge of death .
My parents calmed me down , explaining that " the beginnings of pneumonia " is nothing at all like a full - blown case of the disease — the disease that had taken away the only uncle who ever seemed to enjoy spending time with me , the only uncle I ever really liked .
In retrospect , knowing that my survival was never in question , the whole thing makes me laugh .
But consider : did my lack of knowledge regarding Steve 's condition impact my life in any way ?
From adolescence until about age 17 , I was quite a little conservative twat .
No offense to any conservative twats who might be reading this , but for a while there , I was the teenage equivalent of a Rush Limbaugh and Bill O'Reiley love child .
Chalk it up to my being born in the South , or the influence of my various redneck friends , or some kind of genetic predisposition for acting like an idiot , but I had all the bases covered : women belonged in the kitchen , affirmative action and welfare were just African Americans ' way of getting stuff without having to work for it , abortion is murder , homosexuality is a sin , and the Democrats are all going to Hell .
I was viciously anti-choice and anti-gay .
And like all of my other friends , I figured AIDS was God 's way of punishing homosexuals — a punishment that had somehow managed to spread to the heterosexual population .
( Apparently God is n't quite so picky when he decides to wipe out a group of people , and his shotgun approach to genocide was " accidentally " taking out straights , too . )
These twisted beliefs were encouraged by pretty much every person I ran into , because all my friends had grown up in " good , conservative homes , " and thus had the same whacked - out , intolerant views as me .
It was n't until my senior year in high school , when I came to the conclusion that I was no longer a Christian , that the various bigotries began to melt away .
Over the next few years , for better or for worse , I developed into one of those very same liberals my younger self used to curse all the time .
Once I decided to leave religion behind , concepts like " fetuses have souls " and " gay people are sinners , " just kind of fell by the wayside , as they had no meaning anymore .
So , here 's the $ 64,000 question : could any of this have been avoided ?
Time and time again , studies have pointed out that it is much more difficult to hate something with a human face than it is to hate a stereotype .
I spent an enormous portion of my life hating people for no damn reason whatsoever .
I hated the pro-choicers because I 'd never met anyone who'd ever had an abortion ( as far as I knew ) .
I hated gay people because I 'd never met one ( as far as I knew ) .
All the research seems to suggest that usually , when people actually meet the people they 've grown to hate , they often change their tune .
Hell , for a relevant example look at Vice President and rabid conservative Dick Cheney , who attacked gays every chance he got until his daughter came out of the closet , after which he almost immediately backed off his intolerant stance .
Keeping all that in mind , consider the following :
I grew up thinking I 'd never met a gay man , yet my uncle was bisexual .
( Later , when my parents divorced , my father also came out ... though he would n't tell his family for quite a while longer . )
I grew up thinking AIDS was punishment for bad people , never knowing one of my favorite people had died from it .
I grew up thinking only evil people had abortions , yet my mother had one when I was 6 years old .
( I actually did n't find out about this secret until I was 24 . )
So the obvious question is , would any of the information above have affected the way I lived my life as a teenager ?
Had I been given information when I was younger , rather than being shielded from it , would I have taken a different path than I eventually chose ?
I believe the answer to this question is a clear and resounding " yes . "
When I was a child , had I been given the chance to interact with someone I knew to be gay or bisexual , I never would have fallen for the religious hatemongers ' claims that " homosexuals are all evil " — yet without that exposure , I did indeed fall for those claims ... hook , line , and sinker .
Similarly , if I had been given the chance to come to terms with the fact that my own mother had had an abortion , it seems inconceivable that I would have been as quick to judge others in similar situations .
As evidence for these claims I submit that when I was 17 and had my dramatic about - face with regard to religion , one of the very reasons I began questioning in the first place was that when my father finally " came out " to his family , I had trouble reconciling my feelings for him and my religio- political views on homosexuality .
And thus , my argument would be : if this tiny bit of trivia ( my father 's homosexuality ) was enough to cause me to rethink — and , eventually , abandon — my entire religious and political world view , is n't it reasonable to believe that I would have never adopted those views in the first place , had I been better equipped with the knowledge ( my uncle 's disease , my mother 's abortion ) that was already available ?
Besides trying to " shelter " us , my parents had other reasons for keeping certain things from my sister and I , but most of these reasons were simply unacceptable .
First of all , we were never told about my uncle 's AIDS in part because my parents were afraid of being associated with the ensuing " scandal . "
( Remember , this was back in the 1980s , and especially in the South , AIDS was still something very much to be ashamed of . )
The same type of logic applied to my mother 's abortion — under the flawed assumption that there is something wrong and shameful with terminating a pregnancy , my mother opted to keep it secret from her children , for fear that the neighbors might find out .
But even taking the excuses above into account , the question simply becomes : should parents keep things from ( and / or actively lie to ) their children " for their own sake ? "
Considering that most of my parents ' concerns were unfounded , one can hardly claim that I was lied to " for my own sake . "
In fact , it would seem that the lies came very much at my own detriment .
I rely on an age - old axiom : people cannot be harmed by information , but they can be harmed by ignorance .
It is highly unlikely that , for any of the examples above , knowledge of the " secrets " kept from me would have caused me any harm .
At worst , I would have simply ignored them and continued on my merry way toward rabid conservativism .
But at best , and ( it would seem ) quite probably , that knowledge could have better equipped me to handle the temptations of prejudice and bigotry when I would later encounter them .
The point of this exercise was n't to call into question the parenting skills of my mother or father , nor was it to blame them for the choices I made during my tenure as a bigoted ass .
My parents did what they thought was best at the time ; their motives were postive even if the results were n't what they might have hoped .
What I hope I 've done here is to question the concept of keeping secrets from children " for their own good . "
The suggestion is that , in most cases , such omissions are rarely beneficial to the child involved .
As for questions of timing — i.e. at what age a child is emotionally and intellectually able to comprehend certain subjects — anything I would say would be pure conjecture on my part , as I am not a child psychologist .
Clearly , however , such determinations are relative to the maturity and intelligence of the child , suggesting that parents themselves are the ones best suited to determine when and if a certain secret should be divulged .
Despite this uncertainty regarding when it is appropriate for parents to " let kids in " on the family secrets , I would posit that there is still a quite palpable moral to be gained from all of this , which is :
Within a family , as children grow towards maturity , most ( if not all ) secrets should vanish .
Eventually , a family should have no secrets at all .
To restate it from a slightly different angle : the more knowledge we have , the better equipped we are to handle the future .
But the opposite is also true : with less knowledge , we are less equipped — and therefore more likely to be taken in by evangelists of bigotry and intolerance , more likely to be taken in by those who prey upon ignorance .
Ahmadinejad visited one of Iraq 's most powerful Shia Muslim leaders
He also called on Washington to change its standpoint towards Iran and said it had to understand that the Iraqi people did not like America .
A BBC correspondent says many Iraqis see the visit as the culmination of a process of normalisation in ties .
The two countries fought a war when Saddam Hussein invaded Iran in 1980 .
The BBC's Jim Muir adds that Mr Ahmadinejad has not been welcomed by all Iraqis , since some agree with the Americans ' view that Iran supports extremist militias in Iraq and is to blame for much of the trouble there .
US weapons call
Mr Ahmadinejad , who arrived in Baghdad on Sunday , made his remark about the US and terrorism after US accusations that Iran was supporting militants .
" Six years ago , there were no terrorists in our region , " he said after talks with Abdel Aziz al - Hakim , head of Iraq 's largest Shia Muslim political bloc , the Supreme Council of the Islamic Revolution in Iraq ( Sciri ) .
" As soon as the others landed in this country and the region , we witnessed their arrival and presence . "
Earlier , at a news conference with Iraqi President Jalal Talabani , the Iranian president said it was not Tehran 's fault that Iraq " does not want the US " .
On Saturday , US President George W Bush , speaking at his ranch in Texas , called on Iran to " quit sending in sophisticated equipment that 's killing our citizens " .
The Iranian leader is due to end his visit on Monday .
Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Maliki has said a number of agreements will be signed .
' New page '
HAVE YOUR SAY
The president 's visit will bring benefit neither to the Iranians nor to the Iraqi people Farhad , Tehran
Iraqi leaders extended a warm welcome to the Iranian president , who flew into Baghdad airport and travelled into the city centre by car .
US forces are not involved in security for the visit and did not provide helicopters .
After talks with President Talabani , Mr Ahmadinejad said the visit had opened a " new page " in Iran - Iraq relations .
Prime Minister Maliki said his talks with Mr Ahmadinejad had been " friendly , positive and full of trust " .
Despite the reconciliation between Baghdad and Tehran , many analysts believe that in the long term , the two countries are destined to be rivals for regional power .
During the long war between them in the 1980s , many of the prominent Shia now in positions of power in Iraq fled to Iran as Saddam Hussein cracked down on internal dissent .
The US - led overthrow of Saddam Hussein 's regime allowed them to return from exile .
Trade is now growing between the two countries and tourism , in the form of Iranian pilgrims visiting major Shia shrines in Iraq , is booming .

When young American men and women sign up to serve in the U.S. military , our government makes them a basic promise :
If they are wounded in the line of duty , they will get the care they need .
Unfortunately , for tens of thousands of veterans from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , that ’s a promise that only exists on paper .
On Feb. 18 , 2007 , the headline “ Soldiers Face Neglect , Frustration at Army ’s Top Medical Facility ” was splashed across the front page of one of the nation ’s top newspapers , the Washington Post .
The article , which described unsafe conditions and substandard care at Walter Reed Army Medical Center , began with the story of Army Specialist Jeremy Duncan , who was airlifted out of Iraq in February 2006 with a broken neck and a shredded left ear , “ nearly dead from blood loss . ”
“ Behind the door of Army Spec. Jeremy Duncan ’s room , part of the wall is torn and hangs in the air , weighted down with black mold , ” the article read .
“ When the wounded combat engineer stands in his shower and looks up , he can see the bathtub on the floor above through a rotted hole .
The entire building , constructed between the world wars , often smells like greasy carry - out .
Signs of neglect are everywhere : mouse droppings , belly - up cockroaches , stained carpets , cheap mattresses . ”
The Washington Post ’s coverage of the scandal at Walter Reed sparked outrage and finger - pointing around Washington ’s official circles , but the controversy did not solve the problem of substandard care .
Eight months later , in September , Sergeant GJ Cassidy died while receiving treatment for blast injuries at Fort Knox .
A GAO report released at the time of his death showed half of the military ’s Warrior Transition Units had “ significant shortfalls ” of doctors , nurses and other caregivers to treat wounded soldiers .
It ’s not known how many other soldiers have died the way GJ Cassidy did — alone while allegedly seeking medical care from his government .
But we do know that veterans of the Iraq war are taking their own lives as the Pentagon and the VA fail to provide adequate medical care .
A CBS News investigation in November found that 120 veterans kill themselves every week , adding up to over 6,000 per year .
CBS asked all 50 states for their suicide data , based on death records for veterans and non-veterans , and found that veterans were twice as likely to commit suicide [ as ] those who had not gone to war .
Among those taking their own lives was Sergeant Brian Jason Rand , who served two tours in Iraq .
On February 20 , 2007 , the Clarksville , Tennessee , police department found his body lying face down under an entertainment pavilion on the banks of the Cumberland River , a shotgun lying beside it .
Then there are those who become homeless because of government inaction .
On any given night , 200,000 veterans sleep homeless on the street .
Increasingly those veterans are younger men and women who served in Iraq and Afghanistan .
People like Specialist James Eggemeyer , who ended up homeless just a few months after returning home from Iraq with a severe case of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder triggered by loading the bodies of dead Iraqis into a Blackhawk helicopter .
The VA took so long to process Eggemeyer ’s disability claim that he had to live out of his truck while he waited .
The average wait time for a veteran ’s disability claim to be decided is now 183 days .
More than 600,000 disabled vets are currently waiting .
Tens of thousands more veterans are also being denied medical care and disability benefits they were promised after serving abroad .
The numbers are staggering : 11,407 U.S. soldiers have been discharged for drug abuse after serving in Iraq or Afghanistan ; 6,159 have been kicked out of the military for “ discreditable incidents ” ; 6,436 have been discharged for “ commission of a serious offense ” ; 2,246 have been discharged for “ the good of the service ” ; and 3,365 have been discharged for “ personality disorder , ” according to Pentagon data I obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request .
Among those dishonorably discharged after honorably serving in Iraq is Specialist Shaun Manuel , who returned from a tour in Iraq to find [ his son ] dead of a rare genetic disease called Muscular Spinal Atrophy .
Manuel said the situation was made even more painful when his superiors ordered him to begin training for a second tour in Iraq .
“ My son passed away , ” he told me .
“ You gonna send an emotionally distressed soldier to Iraq — who knows what he ’s going to do ?
I ’m ready to just blow the whole world up because I did n’t see my son being born and then he just passed away on me with no warning . ”
Manuel never filed paperwork to medically excuse him from deployment .
Instead , he withdrew and buried himself in alcohol .
He estimates he drank three fifths of liquor a day .
At one point , his wife had to call the police during a domestic disturbance .
So the military expelled him with dishonorable discharge and now bars him from getting health care and disability benefits .
Even those who have n’t seen combat can be in for a fight .
Private Durrell Michael threw out his back loading generators on a US military base in South Korea .
He could barely walk or stand upright , but the Army tried to deploy him to Iraq anyway .
When he fought back , they gave him a dishonorable discharge .
Now , he ’s in another fight : with the VA for medical care .

Bioshock is one of the most celebrated games of the year
Halo 3 , The Orange Box and Super Mario Galaxy have all been awarded one of the highest accolades in gaming - a perfect score from Edge .
And plenty of other games have been given near perfect scores also - from Bioshock to Crysis , Drake 's Fortune and Call of Duty 4 .
The Edge scores are just one of a number of signs that reinforce a growing feeling that videogames are enjoying a golden age .
It is not just that the interactive experiences are getting ever more immersive , or the industry is being taken ever more seriously , but hardware and software sales are up significantly on last year - buoyed by a new generation of consoles and the work of developers who are beginning to exploit the tools they have at their disposal .
A lot of the games are sequels and I would like to see more innovation
Margaret Robertson , games consultant
" You have to look at the maturity of platforms in part to answer why there are currently so many good games out there , " said Tony Mott , editor of Edge magazine .
" It 's difficult to say across the board that games are getting better .
But we are seeing publishers being more careful about the quality of games that they release .
" And there are so many good games out now that some publishers are holding titles back to next year . "
The industry also looks to have found a way to blend the loose attractions of casual and social gaming with the hardcore experiences beloved by the seasoned player .
GAMES OF THE YEAR ?
Super Mario Galaxy ( pictured ) - 97.3 % The Orange Box - 96.1 % Bioshock - 95.3 % Call of Duty 4 - 95.1 % Halo 3 - 93.2 % God of War 2 - 93 % Mass Effect - 93 % Crysis - 91 % Drake 's Fortune - 89 % Project Gotham Racing 4 - 87 % Assassin's Creed - 84.5 % Gamesrankings.com aggregates review scores
Margaret Robertson , a former editor of Edge and now a games consultant , said long - standing gamers were spending more money on games and a whole new audience had been introduced to gaming for the first time .
" There are now more ways than ever to spend money on video games - from consoles to handhelds , supplementary purchases online via Live Arcade , Virtual Console and the PlayStation Network to games on your iPod .
" The evidence of what Nintendo has done to attract people to games for the first time with the DS and the Wii is unmistakably clear . "
This year will be remembered as the year the Wii took centre stage as the console of choice for families , the year PlayStation 3 finally showed its promise in real terms and the Xbox 360 hit its stride with the 5th anniversary of online service Xbox Live .
It is also the year of the handheld with Nintendo DS and PSP continuing to sell explosively , the year PC gaming began its renaissance and developers got to grips with tools that allowed them to tell stories in new , dynamic ways .
I have been publicly criticised for saying that we are yet to see a next generation game in terms of gameplay .
And I stand by that
David Braben , Frontier Games
Developer David Amor , creative director of Relentless games : " This is the second generation of titles on consoles and speaking as a developer , we are now benefiting from the tools that these machines offer .
David Braben , founder of Frontier games , agreed : " This new generation of machines is now bedding down with developers .
A crop of quality titles emerging simultaneously is typical at this point in a console 's lifecycle .
" I have been publicly criticised for saying that we are yet to see a next generation game in terms of gameplay .
And I stand by that . "
Mr Amor added : " I found myself queuing at the local video game store the other day and that has n't happened for a long time .
There is a batch of very good games out at the moment and I 'm finding myself putting TV and movies to one side to play video games .
Titles like Assassin's Creed and Mass Effect have also helped raise the profile of games with big budget advertising campaigns , and an emphasis on storyline and production values .
Both are expected to join the ranks of million - plus sellers this year .
Margaret Robertson said the market growth for games this year had been " explosive and phenomenal " .
Sales in the US are up 50 % on last year and the Christmas figures are still to come .
First person shooters like Call of Duty 4 are ever more realistic
" On the strength of sales alone 2007 has been the greatest year in gaming - that much is certain , " she said
But she said the industry was also showing signs of maturity .
" This year we have had the huge titles like Halo 3 , The Orange Box and Super Mario Galaxy , which have had huge success and deservedly so .
" But it 's almost the next tier down - games like Project Gotham Racing 4 , Call Of Duty 4 , Ratchet and Clank and God of War 2 - where there has been such ambition and confidence that you can now almost take the quality for granted .
It 's very encouraging . "
She added : " A lot of the games are sequels and I would like to see more innovation . "
Mr Braben said it was ironic that the games getting all the praise are the least representative of the industry as a whole .
" Games like Bioshock and Halo 3 are made for the hardcore gamer while there is a widening family appeal of games and gaming that is less talked about .
" 2007 will probably be remembered as the year of the Wii , " he added .
There ’s a lot of action in any kitchen , so it ’s a good place to start changing habits and chipping away at petroleum use .
The big - ticket items are the appliances .
Refrigerators , dishwashers , ovens , microwaves and stoves all consume energy , and that power often involves a fossil fuel of some sort -- so I count using less power as cutting back on my oil / natural gas addiction .
The machines that came with our 19 - year - old tract house have pooped out and been replaced with more energy - efficient versions .
Our stove is the exception ; it ’s old and uses natural gas .
I can’t feel smug , though , because the river of petroleum - based products that flows through our kitchen easily offsets those gains and would probably get us an F rating from green gurus such as actor and author Ed Begley Jr .

Let ’s start with our worst sin : those plastic grocery bags .
My husband does the food shopping .
He brings everything home in them , and then , like clockwork , throws them in the trash .
I retrieve them for recycling , but we ’re still among those who together consume 12 million barrels ’ worth of oil in plastic bags each year in this country , said Crissy Trask , author of “ It ’s Easy Being Green . ”
In my house , however , plastic - bag policy is not my call .
My husband , who does many other good things for the environment , ca n’t bring himself to tote around the totes .
To maintain household harmony and avoid the disaster that would ensue if I took over grocery shopping and cooking , that change will have to wait .
I feel better knowing that Begley and his wife , Rachelle , readily admit to friendly friction over certain habits and products that she is not willing to give up .

“ I try to be very understanding , ” Begley told me .
“ You do n’t run up Mt. Everest .
You get to base camp , and you get acclimated . . . and not everybody ’s going to make it to the summit . ”
Next up , plastic water bottles .
I thought it helped that I refilled the bottles with filtered tap water for as long as I could before tossing them in the recycling bin and buying a new case .
But that was n’t nearly enough .
And to make matters worse , my husband now drinks those vitamin waters , which end up being single - use items because the flavoring sticks to the bottles .
To nix bottled water at home , I needed containers that were easy to carry , refillable and dishwasher - safe .
Trask suggested substitutes by Klean Kanteen , Sigg or CamelBak ( sold online or at sports stores such as REI ) .
A pair of 18 - ounce Klean Kanteen stainless steel bottles costs $ 31 .
A single 20 - ounce Sigg bottle , aluminum with your choice of colorful designs , was about $ 20 .
Advertisement
But I like to keep six or more bottles filled , refrigerator - chilled and ready to go , so the upfront outlay for stainless steel seemed a bit steep for my purposes .
Instead , I went with CamelBak ’s half - liter plastic Better Bottle with Classic Cap , sold by SummitHut.com for $ 8 each .
The reusable bottle is the right size , dishwasher - safe and free of bisphenol A , a plastics chemical some believe is a health hazard .
Other steps :
We can shun superfluous plastic packaging , buy things made from recycled plastic and use sandwich bags and dish soaps that are n’t petroleum - based .
We also can try harder to buy locally produced food and in bulk .
That chips away at the fuel use involved in moving food around .
It ’s a start .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - How did Democrat Hillary Clinton tumble from all - but - certain presidential nominee to endangered candidate fighting for her political life ?
Democratic strategists and political experts say her path to the political promised land has been pitted with potholes .
Her campaign suffered from overconfidence , had no answer to Barack Obama ’s inspirational call for change , and was unable to control former President Bill Clinton , among other problems .
When she opened her candidacy 13 months ago , she did so with a brash statement : “ I ’m in , and I ’m in to win . ” By August , she was the absolute front - runner , enjoying an 18 percent lead in the polls over Obama , her closest challenger .
With her politically brilliant husband at her side , she was considered by Republicans to be the candidate to beat in the November election .
She and her aides projected an aura of inevitability and she tried to stay above the fray of her chattering rivals .
Many Washington pundits assumed she would defeat the Republican nominee to win the presidency , with Americans looking to turn the page after eight years of President George W. Bush .
Then voters started confounding the pundits and pollsters .
She lost Iowa to Obama , won New Hampshire , split the February 5 “ Super Tuesday ” states with Obama and then lost 11 contests in a row to the Illinois Democratic senator .
A day of reckoning is approaching on Tuesday , when Texas and Ohio vote .
Anything other than sweeping victories in those two states would spell more trouble for her , and possibly signal the end of her campaign .
Stephen Hess , a presidential scholar and political science professor at George Washington University , said the Clinton team “ accepted without question their advance notices . ”
“ There was a real sense that this was their right , ” he said .
‘ FUNDAMENTALLY MISREAD ’ AMERICAN PEOPLE ?
Democratic strategist Jim Duffy said the Clinton campaign “ fundamentally misread ” the American people , believing Americans would prefer her experience over Obama ’s call for sweeping change in the way Washington does business .
“ When Obama catches fire they have nothing to come back with because their whole campaign is premised on the fact that they know Washington and how to wheel and deal and get things done , ” he said .
“ Here ’s a man preaching hope and change ...
Who wants to be on the other side of arguing against that ? ”
Democratic strategist Liz Chadderdon said Clinton never really had a single message that was her own and never developed an emotional connection with voters that resonated like Obama did .
“ Rule No. 1 : Stay on message .
At this point , can you tell me what the message of her campaign is ?
Because I think at this point she has about 90 , ” Chadderdon said .
“ She misread what change means .
Change does n’t mean a change in policy .
Change means a fundamental change in how we do politics in this country . ”
The experts also said the role of her husband damaged her campaign .
For many weeks the former president talked as much about himself as he did her , reminding Americans not only of the good times he brought to the country , but also the bad .
In South Carolina , Bill Clinton angered black voters by saying Obama ’s strength there was equivalent to another African - American candidate , Jesse Jackson , who won the state in 1984 and 1988 but failed to win the Democratic nomination .
“ I think the Jesse Jackson comment was really rock bottom for him , rock bottom you had n’t seen in a decade , ” said a long - time Clinton supporter , who asked to remain anonymous .
But overall , this Democratic strategist said : “ I think that fundamentally she just missed her moment .
There ’s a lot of people who say she ran a bad campaign , should ’ve introduced herself better .
But I think fundamentally that her time passed , and that the day Barack Obama got in the race , at some level for both ( ex - Democratic candidate John ) Edwards and Clinton , it was over . ”

Fox News host certain she can be objective in her journalism Michael Roston and David Edwards
Published : Friday February 15 , 2008

Print This Email This Drawing their inspiration from an article published at the Politico earlier in the week regarding whether or not political news reporters should vote , Fox News hosts had a new worry this week : whether or not journalists covering politics can really remain objective .
For one Fox News on - hair host , the question was easy to answer .
" I feel I can do my job but still exercise my right to vote , " Fox News host Martha MacCallum argued , pointing to her journalistic objectivity .
MacCallum quoted from Politico's John F. Harris , who wrote , " My belief is that being a journalist for an ideologically neutral publication like Politico , or the Washington Post , where I used to work , does not mean having no opinions .
It means exercising self - discipline in the public expression of those opinions so as not to give sources and readers cause to question someones commitment to fairness . "
MacCallum 's agreement with a " commitment to fairness " comes just a few weeks after a huge controversy erupted online after her Fox show took aim ( Video link ) at an Xbox 360 game which she claimed featured " full digital nudity and sex . "
" The Internet hath no fury like a gamer scorned , " Seth Schiesel reported for The New York Times last month , adding that " the game world has been ablaze with indignation since the Fox News program The Live Desk With Martha MacCallum said on Monday that Mass Effect , one of the most critically praised games of 2007 , contains frontal nudity and explicit depictions of sexual activity .
The assertions of virtual lasciviousness first appeared earlier this month among conservative bloggers incensed by brief YouTube clips excerpted from the 30 - to 40 - hour game . "
Schiesel noted that the game " includes a complicated romantic subplot that is no more risqué in its plot or graphic in its depiction than evening network television . "
And while a guest on MacCullum 's show apologized in the Times article for ' sexing up ' a game she had never played , the host and network have refused to apologize or correct the record .
After the game 's publisher Electronic Arts asked the network to " set the record straight on a number of errors and misstatements " which reached " a new level of recklessness , " Fox 's only response was to extend " several invitations to EA through a company representative to appear on Live Desk With Martha MacCallum to discuss " it . "
An offer that the game publisher rejected .
Nearly a year and a half ago , MacCallum was also called out by the liberal blog News Hounds for possibly using an allegedly leaked Fox internal memo as a source for a report on Iraq .
The leaked memo instructed employees to " Be On The Lookout For Any Statements From The Iraqi Insurgents ... Thrilled At The Prospect Of A Dem Controlled Congress . "
" During the Live Desk show that aired the same day as the memo , MacCallum claimed without providing any details or sources that there were ' some reports of cheering in the streets on the behalf of the supporters of the insurgency in Iraq , that they re very pleased with the way things are going here and also with the resignation of Donald Rumsfeld . ' "
News Hounds complained .
" Was MacCallum's ' source ' for the happiness of insurgents in fact nothing more than the morning memo from her boss ?
We 'll never know , but the coincidence is certainly suggestive . "
' UnAmerican ' for journalists to abstain ?
During Friday 's segment , another commentator on Fox seemed to imply that journalists choosing to abstain from voting were giving into Islamic terrorists .
" The first elections in Afghanistan , the Taliban threatened death , anyone who voted had their fingers chopped off but there were news reports on women lining up around the polling places even if it meant that they were going to be harmed because they know what it means to vote in a free election , " argued Christine O'Donnell , a Republican strategist .
" To have journalists say that I can not be objective if my I vote , then you should not be a journalist . "
Fox News legal analyst Peter Johnson , Jr. , went as far as to say that journalists who choose not to vote were not acting like " real Americans . "
The remark prompted the Politico's Jim Vandehei to joke that he sometimes does n't vote because he 's " unAmerican . "
" I did n't know that until right now , it 's fantastic , " he added .

The Big Island 's W.M. Keck Observatory helped astronomers discover a new planet orbiting a sun- like star 41 light years away , making it the first known planetary quintet outside our solar system , astronomers said Tuesday .
The newfound planet joins four others circling the nearby star 55 Cancri in the constellation Cancer .
Although it resides in the star 's so - called habitable zone , a place where liquid water and mild temperatures should exist , it is more like Saturn than Earth and therefore not likely to support life .
Still , scientists have not ruled out the possibility of finding an Earth - like planet within the system as technology improves .
" It 's a system that appears to be packed with planets , " said co-discoverer Debra Fischer , an astronomer at San Francisco State University .
Ranked fourth from 55 Cancri , the latest planet is about 45 times the mass of Earth and has an orbit of 260 days .
It was detected after nearly two decades of observations by ground - based telescopes using the Doppler technique that measures a planet 's stellar wobble .
Using the Keck I telescope atop Mauna Kea , scientists gathered data on the gravitational pull of the planets on the star , said Al Conrad , support astronomer at the Keck Observatory .
They were able to make the discovery using a high - resolution spectrograph upgraded in 2004 with funding from NASA .
" It allowed them to measure the wobble in the star much more precisely , " Conrad said .
" Smaller planets will tug the host less than larger planets . "
The other planets in the 55 Cancri system were discovered between 1996 and 2004 .
The innermost planet is believed to resemble Neptune , while the most distant is thought to be Jupiter - like .
Scientists have detected about 250 exoplanets , or planets orbiting a star other than the sun .
The 55 Cancri star holds the record for number of confirmed planets .
Only one other star is known to have four planets , while several others have three or less .
" We can now say there are stars like the sun that have many worlds around them , " said planetary scientist Jonathan Lunine of the University of Arizona , Tucson , who had no role in the discovery .
The research will appear in a future issue of the Astrophysical Journal .
It was funded by NASA , the National Science Foundation and the University of California .
The latest discovery shows that our solar system is not unique , scientists said .
" When you look up into the night sky and see the twinkling lights of stars , you can imagine with certainty that they have their own complement of planets , " said astronomer Geoff Marcy of the University of California , Berkeley , who was part of the research .

Ireland is as famous for castles as it is for Guinness .
Dotted everywhere on the Emerald Isle , the castles connect modern day tourists with the dramatic history of Ireland .
At the bottom of this article , you 'll find a map where these 10 castles are marked so that you can better plan your Irish vacation .
1 - Dunluce Castle in County Antrim
In County Antrim you can find Dunluce Castle clinging to a rocky outpost of the north Antrim coast .
The castle was built or rebuilt by Richard de Burgh or one of his chief followers during the Anglo Norman period in Ireland , around 1150 AD .
It replaced a fort in the same spot .
Under siege by the British in the 16th century , it fell into disuse in the 17th century when the MacDonnells abandoned the castle .
Dunluce is reputed to be the inspiration for Cair Paravel , the famous castle in CS Lewis ’ The Chronicles of Narnia .
On a clear day you can see out over the sea to the island of Islay in the Irish Sea .
Dunluce Castle is located 3 miles East of Portrush on the road to Bushmills .

Traveling to Ireland
Every major airline flies to Ireland , in particular to Dublin Airport .
Getting a cheap flight to Ireland should be simple most times of the year , although July and August are peak season .
Winter can be cold and rainy , and is best avoided .
If you 're planning to tour some of these castles , it 's a really good idea to rent a car .
Ireland is fairly small and driving is easy .
Just keep in mind that average speeds are lower than in the U.S. as the highway system is limited outside of the ( few ) larger cities .

They say that the spread of the H5N1 virus means that even more chicken and duck will have to be killed than was originally estimated .
On Monday officials said that around 2 m birds would need to be culled - a figure that will now rise .
Health experts have warned that the outbreak could get out of control .
The H5N1 strain of bird flu is regarded as highly pathogenic and can also cause disease and death in humans .
However , most human victims have contracted the disease through close contact with affected birds .
There is little evidence that the virus can be transmitted easily between humans .
' Very serious '
West Bengal 's Minister for animal resources and development , Anisur Rehman , told the BBC there are currently 650 culling teams in the state who have killed about 430,000 birds with another 200,000 expected to be destroyed on Wednesday .
Villagers are reported to be reluctant to hand over birds
They have now been ordered to extend their chicken and duck killing operation from seven to nine districts .
He said that one of the districts most recently affected , Hoogly , is close to Calcutta and contains the state 's largest chicken hatchery - which has not yet been affected .
Mr Rehman said that another district recently hit by the virus , Cochbihar , is close to the border with Bangladesh .
West Bengal has sealed a stretch of its border with Bangladesh , which has been fighting to contain the spread of bird flu since March last year .
Experts in Bangladesh have warned that the outbreak of the virus is far worse than the government is reporting .
" Bird flu is now everywhere .
Every day we have reports of birds dying in farms , " leading Bangladeshi poultry expert MM Khan told the AFP news agency .
" Things are now very serious and public health is [ in ] danger , " he said , alleging that farmers were reluctant to report new cases .
Logistical challenge
The BBC's Amitabha Bhattasali in Calcutta says the authorities in West Bengal face the same problems , with reports of people hiding chicken and duck to stop them from being killed .
The pace of culling has been too slow , critics say
Our correspondent say the authorities face a major logistical challenge , because many of the chickens in infected areas roam around in the open and in many cases have to be chased and caught before they can be killed .
On Monday a team of officials from Delhi told the state government that the pace of the culling operation is too slow .
At the same time , the state government warned that the virus was getting " out of hand " .
It has appealed to eight other Indian states - including Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu - for assistance in the culling operation .
Correspondents say that the problem is made worse because many poor and illiterate farmers are sometimes misinformed about basic hygiene .
Dead birds are reported to have been dumped in village wells and ponds by people not aware of the risks from the H5N1 virus .

This year , more than 1,600 students nationwide entered the Siemens competition .
After several rounds of judging , 20 finalists were chosen to present their projects at N.Y.U. and to vie for scholarships ranging from $ 10,000 to $ 100,000 .
Eleven of the finalists were girls .
It was the first year that girls outnumbered boys in the final round .
Most of the finalists attend public school .
On Sunday , the students gave 12 - minute presentations of their projects , filled with explanations about Herceptin resistance ( when breast cancer patients with HER2 - positive tumors do not respond to the drug Herceptin ) and FtsZ inhibitors ( experiments on a specific protein that could lead to a new treatment for drug - resistant tuberculosis ) .
One of the most popular was by three home - schooled girls from Pennsylvania and New Jersey — Caroline Lang , 16 ; Rebecca Ehrhardt , 15 ; and Naomi Collipp , 16 — who used a Power Point presentation to demonstrate their “ Burgercam ” monitoring system .
It is designed to determine when E. coli bacteria in hamburgers have been safely eliminated by measuring the shrinkage of each patty when fully cooked .
Several hundreds of hamburgers later , the girls took home fifth place and $ 20,000 in scholarship money .
Caroline , Rebecca and Naomi , called “ the Hamburger Girls , ” said they had been friends since they were toddlers and had stayed in touch through a group for home - schooled children .
“ They were concerned it was n’t sophisticated enough , but they wanted to try , ” said Rebecca ’s mother , Alicia Butcher Ehrhardt , a plasma physicist .
The court said ads interrupted the viewing experience of a film
The case was brought by directors Vilgot Sjoeman and Claes Eriksson , who sued television channel TV4 for introducing ad breaks into their films .
The two directors never gave permission for ads to be shown during their films .
The ruling will not stop all ads on movies shown on Swedish TV as most directors have signed waivers to allow ads in order to obtain funding .
The court ruled that the commercial breaks spoiled the viewing experience .
" Even when a commercial is placed in between scenes ... it interrupts the interplay between the film 's scenes as planned by the director , " the court stated .
" Of course I 'm relieved .
With this ruling , the decision has been left up to the director whether or not there should be breaks in a film , " AFP news agency quoted Mr Eriksson as saying .
Mr Sjoeman died in 2006 .
The court ordered TV4 to pay the directors ' court costs of $ 50,000 ( £ 25,000 ) .

Is " Canadian " the new black ?
Perhaps – that is if you 're a racist speaking in code .
Recent revelations that the term " Canadian " is being used to replace racist names for black people have got a Texas assistant district attorney into trouble and have left others wondering what exactly it means to be labelled a Canadian in the American south .
Long derogated as weak - kneed liberals with lax laws and funny monopoly money , Canadians have carried a negative connotation in certain regions of America – but not as a replacement for the N - word .
Earlier this week a columnist with the Houston Chronicle uncovered an email from Harris County assistant district attorney Mike Trent who , in a congratulatory note to a junior prosecutor , used the word " Canadians " to describe blacks on a jury .
Trent wrote of the prosecutor in a 2003 email : " He overcame a subversively good defence by Matt Hennessey that had some Canadians on the jury feeling sorry for the defendant and forced them to do the right thing . "
Trent 's email remained unchallenged by colleagues who received the email , despite there being no actual Canadians on the jury .
But when Trent 's office came under scrutiny this month over an unrelated incident , the email was unearthed , leaving Trent open to accusations of bigotry .
Those accusations are grounded in allegations that the use of " Canadians " was in keeping with the definition listed on an online racial slurs database that defines " Canadian " as a masked replacement for the N - word .
In his own defense , Trent said he honestly thought there had been Canadians on the jury and did not understand the negative connotation of the word .
Others , including the columnist with the Houston Chronicle initially thought the reference to Canadians may have been a misspelling of Californians , who are themselves seen to espouse many of the same liberal values as Canadians .
Despite the controversy , Henry Wells , a Texan and media relations officer with the Canadian Consulate General in Dallas , says he has never heard the term used in a racial manner before .

( CNN ) --
When I was a first - grader in South Dakota , my older brother and I climbed onto a sled , at the top of an ice covered trail that plunged through a forest .
Florida and Michigan got stripped of their Democratic delegates for scheduling their primaries too early .
He stretched out on his stomach and grabbed the steering handles , I climbed onto his back and held tight .
A quick push and we were flying ; faster and faster , ice crystals stinging , the steel runners cutting like blades .
Then we saw it .
Dead ahead .
A fat pine .
He yelled for me to fall off ; lighten the load so he might swerve away .
I held tight .
He said I was pinning his arms down .
I held tight .
He said we were going to hit .
He was right .
As we lay in the snow by our crumpled sled , gloves , hats , boots strewn around like a yard sale , two teenage girls walked by .
They looked at us , looked at the tree , looked the sled run , and summed up our adventure .
" Well , you could have seen that coming . "
Michigan .
Florida .
The Democrats could have , should have seen it coming .
Watch what led to the delegate dilemma »
Back when they decided to punish both states by stripping them of their delegates for moving up their primaries , national party officials made it clear they felt they had no other choice .
With so many states angling for a bigger say in the election process , if they did n't stop these two big players , they feared an avalanche of others would follow .
Christmas caucuses .
Halloween primaries .
Who knew where it would stop ?
But even back then , other troubling questions were rising :
Are you really going to tell all those Democrats they can't play ?
Do n't you worry that they 'll be angry and will punish the party in the general election ?
And for crying out loud , does n't Florida in January sound a lot nicer than New Hampshire ?
But they went ahead , and now they are paying .
They left the basement full of oily rags , matches and 5 - year - olds , and now they are surprised that it 's burning .
Putting out the blaze around these two states now is possible -- but so problematic it almost defies rational discussion .
Do you count the votes as they were taken ?
Give everything to Hillary Clinton ?
The Barack Obama people would go nuts .
Do you keep both states locked out and say " the rules are the rules " ?
Remember what I just said about the Obama people ?
Multiply that by the millions of Democrats in both states .
Do you come up with a way to revote ?
Maybe .
But it is expensive , time consuming , and would almost certainly face serious complaints that it is a tainted process precisely because both states voted once already in clearly unsanctioned fashion , and yet , Clinton was declared the leader .
In other words , a revote would begin under a false premise , ( no matter how much people say it would not ) that she is the natural front - runner in both states .
And oh , by the way , any means of bringing these two states into the process now as tight as the race is , will grant them both precisely what they wanted in the first place : Decisive roles in picking the nominee .
I understand why people in both of these states feel like they are being cut out .
Because , frankly , they are being cut out .
What I do n't understand is how the Democratic Party is going to get itself out of the mess it is in without infuriating at least half of the people who have voted so far ; specifically , whichever half winds up losing the nomination .
I 'm also not sure which national level Democrat has the muscle and courage , given the raw feelings rising around this election , to step in and lead the charge toward a compromise .
Because in the end , if Florida and Michigan come back into the process , unless some sort of equal split is worked out , one candidate will benefit and one will suffer .
And the losers are not going to be happy .
Like a big fat pine at the bottom of your sled run :
You ought to see it coming .

All About Democratic Party • U.S. Presidential Election
Cambridge , Mass .
ON first watching Hillary Clinton ’s recent “ It ’s 3 a.m. ” advertisement , I was left with an uneasy feeling that something was not quite right  something that went beyond my disappointment that she had decided to go negative .
Repeated watching of the ad on YouTube increased my unease .
I realized that I had only too often in my study of America ’s racial history seen images much like these , and the sentiments to which they allude .
I am not referring to the fact that the ad is unoriginal ; as several others have noted , it mimics a similar ad made for Walter Mondale in his 1984 campaign for the Democratic nomination .
What bothers me is the difference between this and the Mondale ad .
The Mondale ad directly and unequivocally played on the issue of experience .
The danger was that the red telephone might be answered by someone who was “ unsure , unsteady , untested . ”
Why do I believe this ?
Because the phone and Mr. Mondale are the only images in the ad .
Fair game in the normal politics of fear .
Not so this Clinton ad .
To be sure , it states that something is “ happening in the world ”  although it never says what this is  and that Mrs. Clinton is better able to handle such danger because of her experience with foreign leaders .
But every ad - maker , like every social linguist , knows that words are often the least important aspect of a message and are easily muted by powerful images .
I have spent my life studying the pictures and symbols of racism and slavery , and when I saw the Clinton ad ’s central image  innocent sleeping children and a mother in the middle of the night at risk of mortal danger  it brought to my mind scenes from the past .
I could n’t help but think of D. W. Griffith ’s “ Birth of a Nation , ” the racist movie epic that helped revive the Ku Klux Klan , with its portrayal of black men lurking in the bushes around white society .
The danger implicit in the phone ad  as I see it  is that the person answering the phone might be a black man , someone who could not be trusted to protect us from this threat .

Agreement With Ector County School Board Will Prevent Unconstitutional Curriculum From Being Taught
ODESSA , TX – The Ector County School Board agreed today to stop teaching a course in its public schools that unconstitutionally promotes a particular interpretation of the Bible that is not shared by Jews , Catholics , Orthodox Christians , and most Protestants .
The agreement settles a federal lawsuit filed in May 2007 that was brought by eight Odessa parents and taxpayers who argued that the course , created by a religious organization , violated their constitutional right to religious liberty by promoting specific religious doctrines to children in their community .
The parents were represented by the American Civil Liberties Union , the ACLU of Texas , People For the American Way Foundation and the law firm of Jenner and Block LLP .
“ This agreement is a victory for those who wish religious education to be in the hands of parents and not public school officials , ” said Dr. T. Jeremy Gunn , Director of the ACLU ’s Program on Freedom of Religion and Belief .
“ It is unacceptable for government officials to decide which religious beliefs are true and which are not and then use the public school system as a means of proselytizing children . ”
The lawsuit challenged the school board ’s decision last year to teach a controversial Bible course created by the National Council on Bible Curriculum in Public Schools ( NCBCPS ) , a private group that promotes its own particular interpretation of the Bible .
The NCBCPS has been criticized by recognized biblical scholars for its religious bias and unsound scholarship .
Under the agreement , Ector County schools may not teach the current course after this school year .
If the board decides to offer a different Bible course in the future , the course must follow strict legal standards for objectivity and may not be based on the NCBCPS curriculum .
“ Public schools may offer courses about the Bible if they do so in an objective and balanced way , ” said Judith E. Schaeffer , Legal Director of People For the American Way Foundation .
“ But the evidence is overwhelming that these constitutional principles have been ignored in Ector County schools .
Students have been taught one religious interpretation of the Bible .
That ’s not only violating the Constitution , it ’s also giving students a bad education . ”
The elective course was being taught in two high schools in Odessa , Texas — Permian High School and Odessa High School .
Among other things , the Bible course required students to give “ true ” or “ false ” answers to questions that should be a matter of religious faith .
Public school teachers sought to promote religious life lessons by having students memorize biblical passages and then discuss how the passages affected their lives , the groups filing the lawsuit said .
The course also presented an unbalanced view of American history that promoted specific religious beliefs that is in conflict with objective scholarly standards .
Douglas C. Hildebrand , an ordained elder and deacon at a local Presbyterian Church and one of the longtime Odessa residents who was a plaintiff in the lawsuit , said it is inappropriate for one set of religious beliefs to be promoted over others .
“ Religion is an essential component of my life and the life of my family , but this course did nothing more than advocate certain religious views that are not shared by everyone , ” Hildebrand said .
“ It seems as though a church had invaded the public school system - and it was n’t my church . ”
Lisa Graybill , Legal Director for the ACLU of Texas , said sound scholarship was never the primary objective of the course .
“ This class was never about educating students , but rather the promotion of one particular set of religious beliefs to the exclusion of all others , ” Graybill said .
“ There are a number of ways in which religion ’s role in society , history and literature can be constitutionally taught to students , but that was clearly not the objective of this particular course . ”
The NCBCPS course has been seriously criticized by Bible scholars for its lack of accuracy , ignorance of scholarly research , and biased promotion of a particular religious interpretation of the Bible .
Although the NCBCPS defends its curriculum as being constitutional , its own website at one time revealed a different agenda , urging people to contact NCBCPS as a “ first step to get God back in your public school ” – a designation that was removed after the lawsuit was filed .
According to Daniel Mach , the Director of Litigation of the ACLU ’s Program on Freedom of Religion and Belief , Ector County school officials now have a much clearer understanding of what the Constitution does and does not allow .
“ The agreement gives the school board a clear roadmap if it decides to adopt a new course , ” Mach said .
“ We trust that any future curriculum will be appropriate for students of all faiths – including nonbelievers – and that it will respect the religious liberty of all Odessans . ”

‘ Stinking Evidence ’ of Possible Election Fraud Found in Florida
[ << | Prev | Index | Next | >>]
Friday , October 12 , 2001 ADHD
Normals are worse at noticing the probe when it comes soon after the blue letter , presumably because they 're still busy processing the identity of the blue letter .
As the probe letter moves further away , this effect diminishes until about 700 ms or so at which point the probe is identified with the same accuracy as in the control case where there 's no blue letter to confound the task .
ADHD people respond just like normals ( quantitatively as well as qualitatively ) except that they do n't get better as the probe moves further away .
In effect , once their attention is caught by the blue letter , they can't switch back to looking for the probe .
The basic hypothesis which this supports is that ADHD people have poor volitional control over focus , but normal automated focus response to stimulus .
I.e. , ADHD people are drawn to whatever their innate mechanisms decide is " interesting " , but they have poor ability to willfully override this and focus on something else instead .
Hence , for instance , the classic trait of wanting to read a chapter of a school text , but being literally unable to do it -- not merely " deciding it 's not really important " as many non-ADHD folks might accuse , but literally being unable to focus on the text despite profound and sincere conscious effort to do so .
In short , if the text is n't inherently interesting in some way to the ADHD reader , it simply will not capture their focus , and they lack the volitional pathway to override this .
One is reminded of the theorized hunter / farmer dichotomies -- it 's certainly easy enough to imagine how these two different styles of focus may each be beneficial in different contexts .
I also wonder how it correlates to the Mapper / Packer dichotomy -- I suspect ADHD folks are far more likely to be Mappers , and normals to be Packers .
Why ?
Because our inherent metric of interest is based on what is both novel and yet comprehensible to us -- the frontiers of our knowledge .
By contrast , something that 's either old hat or so disconnected from our current knowledge base that it 's just jibberish is not the sort of thing to capture one 's attention .
Of course , I 've just described school , or certainly at least the first twelve years of it , since no class can possibly be paced to exist always at the frontiers of every student 's knowledge -- rather , students are required to exercise their volitional control over their focus in order to attend to stuff that 's often inherently not interesting , or perhaps more relevantly to my point , often inherently either beyond or beneath their comprehension .
The normal student has the advantage , then , of being able to pack away knowledge which they do n't necessarily understand at the time , which they can then pull out and potentially apply some time in the future .
The ADHD student can't do it -- if it does n't map into their current world model , they simply can't grasp it with their attention , and it slips away .
And this is why ADHD is seen as a disability to be cured with Ritalin or other amphetamines which seem to bolster that volitional control of focus ( or perhaps they quell the automated one ? ) .
But wait ... do we really want to turn everyone into Packers ?
It may sound functional on the surface , but clearly there are some contexts in which it is vital to be a Mapper .
And more generally , the ability to assimilate what you do n't understand directly translates to the ability to assimilate things which are n't true , since by definition the assimilator has no applicable world model to check the information against and fit it to .
So , the inability of ADHD people to volitionally control their focus is also a protection mechanism against assimilating false information .
It 's no wonder our society is so hot to cure it .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Warren Buffett concluded a highly profitable year for his Berkshire Hathaway Inc BRKa.
NBRKb.N with an admonition for lenders who fueled the housing crisis and words of caution that Berkshire 's own results might be less stellar than in 2007 .

Buffett concluded a highly profitable year for his Berkshire Hathaway with an admonition for lenders who fueled the housing crisis and words of caution that Berkshire 's own results might be less stellar than in 2007 .
REUTERS / Mike Segar
Despite an 18 percent fall in fourth - quarter profit , net income for all of 2007 rose 20 percent to $ 13.21 billion .
The late - year weakness stemmed from weaker results in insurance , Berkshire ’s main business , and in units linked to housing , including businesses that make bricks and carpet , and that offer real estate brokerage services .
Despite spending $ 32.51 billion on stocks and bonds in 2007 , Buffett went another year without the big acquisition he said he wants , leaving Berkshire sitting on $ 44.33 billion of cash .
Some investors say the current environment of beaten - down stocks and sluggish capital markets offers the 77 - year - old Buffett plenty of opportunities .
“ He ’s kept this war chest of cash , rather painfully , for a decade , waiting for the opportunity he has now , ” said Glenn Tongue , who oversees $ 140 million of hedge fund capital at T2 Partners LLC in New York , including a stake in Berkshire .
“ History demonstrates that his patience results in extraordinarily attractive opportunities for Berkshire . ”
In his widely read , 20 - page annual letter to shareholders , Buffett said “ the party is over ” in insurance , where margins are tightening after Berkshire was for a time able to boost premiums after Hurricane Katrina in 2005 .
He said insurance earnings will likely be lower for a few years .
Insurance often generates about half of Berkshire ’s profits .
Buffett said he is looking to invest more outside the United States , after paying $ 4 billion for a controlling stake in Israel 's Iscar Metalworking Cos and buying stock of South Korean steelmaker Posco 005490.KS , French drugmaker Sanofi- Aventis SA SASY .
PA and British retailer Tesco Plc
TSCO.L .
He also invests in such multinational companies as Coca - Cola Co KO.N and Procter & Gamble Co PG.N .
CRITICISM OF INFLATED EARNINGS
Buffett plans to still focus mainly on U.S. investments , despite the country ’s “ many imperfections and unrelenting problems . ”
That includes housing , where Buffett ladled blame on lenders who weakened their underwriting standards in the false belief that housing prices would go up and keep going up .
“ Today , our country is experiencing widespread pain because of that erroneous belief , ” Buffett wrote .
“ As house prices fall , a huge amount of financial folly is being exposed .
You only learn who has been swimming naked when the tide goes out -- and what we are witnessing at some of our largest financial institutions is an ugly sight . ”
Buffett has transformed Berkshire since 1965 into a $ 216 billion conglomerate by acquiring out - of - favor companies with strong earnings and management , and investing in stocks .
The company has 76 operating businesses that make such things as ice cream , paint and underwear .
In December , Buffett moved to diversify further by creating his own insurer to guarantee municipal bonds , at a time other bond insurers are suffering from exposure to risky debt .
He did not discuss that venture in his shareholder letter .
“ Few Berkshire companies can look forward to dramatic earnings growth in this environment , ” said Frank Betz , a principal at Carret / Zane Capital Management LLP in Warren , New Jersey , which owns Berkshire stock .
“ These can be overcome as the subprime crisis fades and insurance rates start to rise . ”
“ Even if he does n’t keep earning $ 13 billion a year , ” Betz added , “ it ’s reasonable he might earn $ 11 billion . ”
In his letter , Buffett reserved other criticism for companies that assume their pension funds can return 8 percent a year , even in an era of low interest rates .
That return , he said , was the average assumption of 363 companies in the Standard & Poor 's 500 .SPX that have pension plans .
“ What is no puzzle , however , is why CEOs opt for a high investment assumption :
It lets them report higher earnings , ” Buffett wrote .
“ And if they are wrong , as I believe they are , the chickens wo n’t come home to roost until long after they retire . ”
Buffett also confirmed Berkshire still has three internal candidates to eventually succeed him as chief executive , and four candidates to replace him as chief investment officer .
Now that the New York Times has gone public with John McCain 's affair , Ron Paul has a real shot at picking up a lot of McCain 's supporters .
Ron Paul announced that he was temporarily scaling back his campaign ; but he did not say he was dropping out .
Indeed , Dr. Paul decided several weeks ago to : With the Times ' revelations about McCain , this may have been a very wise strategy indeed .
The race may suddenly be wide open again .
At their meeting one year ago , VanDerClock personally reviewed the military credentials of Source A that were , in VanDerClock ’s opinion , “ impeccable ” .
Source A showed Vanderclock an album of his military service in classified facilities .
This helps confirm some of the claims of Source A of having worked in classified facilities where he was exposed to projects involving extraterrestrial technology and life .
Source A possessed , for example , a classified document he obtained in 1982 that detailed retrieval operations for crashed extraterrestrial vehicles that was another version of the famed Special Operations Manual that publicly emerged in 1994 .
VanDerClock ’s confirmation of Source A ’s military background and service in highly classified facilities is significant since Source A claims he was instructed to brief the UN meeting on UFO sightings and extraterrestrial life under extraordinary security procedures .
Source A had claimed that he was authorized leak information about the UN meeting , prior to its occurrence , by his superior , an undisclosed Navy admiral to the general public .
The Pickering brothers claimed to have received the information on February 11 , and relayed the information to me on February 12 , soon after the meeting had taken place .
According to VanDerClock , Source A is very reliable and there is no reason to doubt what he has disclosed so far .
VanDerClock believes Source A is being directed to release information by an admiral as Source A claims .
Asked where he would place Source A in terms of a hypothetical credibility scale from zero to 100 , VanDerClock replied , around 92 % .
Vanderclock ranks Source
A ’s testimony very highly , and ranks him among the three most important whistleblowers he has come across .
He places Source A alongside former military intelligence officer Lt Col.
Philip Corso , Snr , and former NASA rocket specialist , Clark McClelland , as the three most significant ‘ insiders ’ to so far have revealed accurate information on UFOs and extraterrestrial life .
Vanderclock was therefore highly confident that the secret UN meeting on UFOs / extraterrestrials occurred on February 12 as claimed by Source A .
Bob VanDerClock has been researching UFO ’s for 15 years and has done 76 public lectures and written several research papers .
He served for three years in the U.S. military as an Army Intelligence agent during the Vietnam War performing military intelligence duties .
He is currently a postmaster in the U.S. Postal Service .
More info available here .
VanDerClock stated that he is willing to sign an affidavit confirming his meeting and review of Source A ’s credentials .
VanDerClock ’s testimony corroborates another researcher who also met with Source A and reviewed his credentials subsequent to the February 12 meeting .
Robert Morningstar , Associate Editor of UFO Digest and a Vice Commander in the US Coast Guard Reserve , also confirmed Source A ’s credentials , and believes Source A is truthfully disclosing events as they have occurred .
Consequently , VanDerClock has provided additional independent corroboration of the initial claims of the Pickering brothers concerning Source A ’s military background , and his background in classified projects .
This helps further establish the credibility of Source A ’s original claims that he was responsible for a briefing to the UN on UFOs and extraterrestrial life , and had been authorized to disclose this to the general public .
The brainiacs who ’ve made air travel almost as fun as a 10 - hour Coca - Cola enema have unveiled their new master plan for creating an efficient security system … federally mandated drivers licenses for everybody under the age of 50 , which all states will be forced to comply with by 2011 , whether they ’re capable or doing so or not , if the Department of Homeland Security gets its way .
The rationalization for this plan , of course , is the same as that for any authoritarian program …a centrally mandated , controlled , and issued driver ’s license will make it more difficult for con artists , drug traffickers , illegal immigrants , or terrorists to gain access to identification that could compromise our security .
What goes unsaid , of course , is that such a program will inevitably make it more difficult for everyone else to get a driver ’s license as well .
Do you like the two - hour wait at your state DMV every time you have to renew your driver ’s license ?
You can bet it ’s going to be longer once every application has to run through a federal database that ’s responsible for processing 50 times as many applications which will need to be cross-checked against watchlists of known terrorists , criminals , or illegal aliens .
Considering how flawlessly this approach has worked for the FAA with their no - fly lists , I ’m finding it a little hard to believe that the process will run more efficiently or effectively than it does now , or that you ’ll be getting your new driver ’s license back on the same day that you ’ve applied for it ( as you can now ) .
Especially since the systems and processes the feds use to cross-reference are notoriously buggy .
Of course now if you go to the DMV and the computers are down , the inconveniences are relatively minimal .
You may have to come back the next day and endure another two hour wait , and you have to be a bit more careful about any traffic violations lest you get busted for driving on an expired license but you ’ll generally be able to go about your life relatively freely .
Under the feds ’ new program , however , if you are n’t able to procure your license for reasons beyond your control , or if you ’re actually denied a license you wo n’t be able to enter a federal building , board an airplane , open a bank account , buy a gun , vote , verify your identity when using a credit or debit card , or do anything else that ’s significantly affiliated with the federal government .
Basically , the Real ID program will effectively strip anyone who does n’t have a federally - issued ID card of their citizenship or ability to even function in everyday society .
Perhaps the people who oppose Real ID are being unfair and overly paranoid , but considering that the Bush ’s new Czar of Homeland Security , Michael Chertoff , issues absolute gibberish like this …
“ We worked very closely with the states in terms of developing a plan that I think will be inexpensive , reasonable to implement and produce the results , ” he said .
“ This is a win -win .
As long as people use driver ’s licenses to identify themselves for whatever reason there ’s no reason for those licenses to be easily counterfeited or tampered with . ”
… to explain his position , somehow I do n’t think that their fears are that insane , especially since the creation of an identification card that cannot be forged is about as likely as the ability to corporeally exist without occupying space .
And spending the better part of ten years watching my own little section of the federal government ( the U.S. Army ) screw up even the most basic of background checks has led me to believe that the feds are generally incapable of handling and should rarely , if ever , be entrusted with this sort of authority .
Update : A commenter who expanded on this on his own site raised one very valid point that I think merits highlighting :
It ’s funny .
They keep calling it a “ driver ’s license , ” but they never mention anything about driving .
Update 2 : Apparently 17 states have already objected to the Real ID plan .

The biggest problem with the 9/11 Truth Movement is where it leads : a place dark and evil beyond imagination .
Even if deep down you believed it was an inside job , you would need to deny it .
So when hundreds of American military officers , pilots , engineers , and CIA veterans stepped forward to say they believed the official story to be a monstrous lie , I was shaken to the core .
There had to be an explanation for everything .
The combination of forces and heat that took down the towers was unique ; no engineer could give a definitive answer .
The hijackers got lucky , including a good dose of incompetence and shortsightedness on the part of the government , which is nearly criminal , but not complicit .
It 's always easier for governments to lie than admit how stupid they are .
The conspiracies led to the deep dark hole that we are ruled by criminal psychopaths , who , in one theory , had knowledge of impending attacks by bin Laden , and made sure they would succeed .
But are we ?
Hundreds of military officers of the highest rank with everything to lose ( since their paychecks are signed by the US government ) , and scientific and engineering professionals , their credentials an open target , as well as the legions of Americans who sacrificed jobs or emptied their 401Ks to perform the thousands of hours of research , retrieval of video clips seen once on television then strangely disappeared , and all the other thankless , payless tasks associated with putting together evidence that can no longer be ignored .
This tells me our republic is alive and well , and we can only be ruled by a cabal if we let them .
The credentials of patriotsquestion911.com read like a wall of shining brass and silver mounted on wood , the accomplishments of lifetimes decorating grandpa 's study : Former Commanding General of U.S. Army Intelligence and Security Command , 1981 - 1984 .
Also commanded the U.S. Army ’s Electronic Research and Development Command and the U.S. Army ’s Intelligence School and Center .
Retired commercial airline captain with 27 years experience .
Aircraft flown : Boeing 727 , 757 and 767 , McDonnell Douglas MD - 80 , and Fokker F - 100 .
Retired fighter pilot .
Former Air Combat Instructor , U.S. Navy Fighter Weapons School ( Topgun ) .
Professor Emeritus , Structural Dynamics and Earthquake Engineering , Swiss Federal Institute of Technology .
Former President , Joint Committee on Structural Safety , Swiss Federal Institute of Technology .
And there are HUNDREDS of them .
Those buildings were full of people .
How could anybody " pull " them down ?
How is it possible for a human being to do this ?
It was happening to me .
Reading all that two and four - star brass saying it looked like a conspiracy put me face - to - face with it .
I was becoming a 9/11 Truther .
Kooks , lunatics , nuts .
Everyone knows this .
But these experts were just too credible , something the movement had n't been before .
I did n't need to be an expert or do much more research .
It had been done , by military personnel with more flying time and expertise than I would have in a dozen lifetimes .
And if they said there were a hell of lot of questions that needed to be answered in a new commission , That was good enough for me .
I am now a 9/11 Truther .
Praise the Lord and pass the ammunition .
Their words are unparsed and direct : " a joke , " " a cover - up , " " a monstrous series of lies , " " a pretext for war , " " not a serious piece of analysis , " riddled with " serious shortcomings , " " omissions , " and " major flaws .
"
Here finally was the testimony I both sought and dreaded , confirming , in many cases , my first instincts on hearing the news on that terrible day .
Amateur pilots flew these planes HOW FAR and threaded needles in a haystack ?
That pilot did a steep HOW MANY degree dive to hit the Pentagon ?
Everyone who has seen a demolition on TV is to believe that these were NOT demolitions , buildings falling at free - fall speed into their own footprint ?
But I 'm no expert on much of anything .
I leave it to the people who make this stuff their study 8 hours a day , year after year , and have the degrees to show for it .
Of the corkscrew dive which supposedly put a commercial airliner into the Pentagon , Pilots For 911 Truth say :
" Once this maneuver was completed , without going into a graveyard spiral , he started to pull out of the descent at 2200 feet and accelerated only 30 knots more at full power to 460 knots in a descent from 2200 feet to the pentagon in about a minute ( Whats Vmo at sea level for a 757 ?
Flap speed ?
Since it looks like he may have found the flap handle only accelerating 60 knots from 7000 feet , the from 2200 feet at full power ) .
AA77 crossed the highways , knocking down light poles , entered ground effect , didnt touch the lawn and got a 44 foot high target ( Tail height of 757 ) into a 77 foot target completely , without overshooting or bouncing off the lawn , or spreading any wreckage at 460 knots .
With a 33 foot margin for error .
Wow , impressive .
Takes a real steady hand to pull that off .
I know it would take me a few tries to get it so precise , especially entering ground effect at those speeds .
Any slight movement will put you off 50 feet very quickly .
Im sure we all would agree . "
" So , who pulled off this stunt ?
Hani Hanjour .
Reported to have 600TT and a Commercial Certificate ( see quotes right margin ) .
Hani tried to get checked out in a 172 a few weeks prior at Freeway Airport in MD .
Two seperate CFI 's took Hani up to check him out .
Baxter and Conner found that Hani had trouble controlling and landing a 172 at 65 knots .
Bernard , the Chief CFI , refused to rent him the 172 .
I have instructed many years .
I have soloed students in 172's when i had 300 hours as a CFI .
How anyone could not control a 172 at 600TT and a Commercial is beyond me .
Flight Schools keep going till you " get it " if you are a bit rusty , and then rent you the plane .
They are in business to make money after all .
. right ?
The Chief CFI basically refused any further lessons and basically told him to get lost . "
The question becomes : how do people deal with the monstrous implications of this ?
I think most people , even if they are convinced , could not deal with the enormity of an entire government this evil .
But a limited cabal of criminal psychopaths I can wrap my mind around .
That can be excised .
Other countries have gone through their velvet revolutions , gone through truth commissions , like the silent protests of Mothers of the Disappeared in Argentina , and they have gone on .
Pinochets and Fujimoris have been put on trial , or near it , and the countries have gone on .
This can be done without civil strife and social upset .
Some of the most important people in this kind of truth movement , the nation 's military officers , are speaking out .
For every sign of being surrounded by evil , I see three other signs of being surrounded by brave , fearless patriots .
The relatively small cabal that the 9/11 Truth Movement leads us to involves , according to Lt. Col.
Guy S. Razer , MS , U.S. Air Force ( ret ) , " treasonous perpetrators that have infiltrated the highest levels of our government . "
The 9/11 Truth Movement should be about reconciliation and finding out the truth .
Full amnesty should be offered to military officers who step forward who are privy to details of the stand - down , the Pentagon operation , or other military - technical details .
Immunity should also be granted to members of Congress who believe they received briefings which may make them complicit .
We have questions .
Lots of questions .
Mr. Wolfowitz , please elaborate on the phrase " absent a catalyzing event - like a new Pearl Harbor " in reference to the Project for a New American Century 's clear advocacy of a military invasion of Iraq , page Section V of the essay " Rebuilding America 's Defenses . "
Am I to take it that a new Pearl Harbor would have been welcomed ?
As a major policy - maker do you understand how close this is to treason , sir ?
My colleague Garett Jones mentioned he ’d just written on how to get more women in economics , just after I ’d noticed a recent Science article , " Igniting Girls ’ Interest in Science . "
Both of which raise the question :
Do those who want more women in science , economics , politics , etc. understand that more women in some places requires fewer women elsewhere ?
If so , why do n’t they tell us where exactly they want fewer women – and explain why the world is better with fewer women there ?
Without this , they sound like people pushing more state education spending without saying whose taxes should be raised to pay for it .
Sure , one could favor more skilled and productive women , which implies fewer women in lower skilled jobs .
But if this is the issue the question should be where can women be the most productive , not how to get more women in science .
And then why not listen to economists ’ long - neglected advice on how most everyone could be more productive ?
" Hey , I ’m just saying … "

Obama camp counters Clinton 's ' big state spin ' Nick Juliano
Published : Wednesday March 12 , 2008
|
Print This Email This Swing state lawmakers argue Obama best for November , pan Clinton attacks Barack Obama 's presidential campaign is pushing back at what it calls Hillary Clinton 's " big state spin , " arguing that the young , charismatic senator does well enough among independents and Republicans to prevail in states Clinton has no chance of winning in November .
Democratic lawmakers from five swing states that went to Obama made the case that only Obama can expand the party 's reach beyond the standard cadre of coastal blue states .
If Clinton were to be the nominee , there would be no room for error , the governors said , because she would be unable to compete beyond the states that voted for John Kerry and Al Gore along with a small number of battlegrounds .
" It 's not even close in terms of the difference a candidate like Obama makes , " said Iowa Gov. Chet Culver , whose state went for Obama in the first caucus this year .
Culver pointed to a recent Des Moines Register poll that had Obama taking 53 percent of the vote there against Republican nominee John McCain , who had 36 percent ; conversely , McCain beat Clinton in Iowa 49 - to - 40 percent in the same poll .
Along with Iowa 's Culver , lawmakers from Missouri , Virginia , Wisconsin and Washington state touted Obama 's prospects in the general election .
All five of those states voted before Clinton 's campaign began aggressively questioning whether Obama was qualified to be commander in chief .
They criticized Clinton for undercutting Obama 's credentials and for suggesting that McCain was more qualified that he was to enter the Oval Office .
Responding to questions from RAW STORY , the lawmakers predicted that had Clinton unveiled similar attacks before their states voted , she would have lost by even wider margins .
Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill criticized Clinton's " 3 a.m. ad " that ran in Texas this month and said voters in her state were tired of being subjected to fear - based attacks .
" Fear has not made us safer under the Bush administration .
It has not enhanced our standing around the world .
It certainly has not helped the middle class figure out how to get health care , " she said .
" The fear card would not [ have been ] played effectively . "
Wisconsin Gov. Jim Doyle noted that Clinton 's campaign unveiled its first negative ad in Wisconsin , and he predicted that if the attacks had continued Obama 's victory would have been even greater than the 17 - point margin he attained .
" It 's kind hard to lose by 17 points , " he said .
" I think she would 've lost by even more than that . "
Claire McCaskill 's post was incorrectly identified in an earlier version of this article .
She is a Democratic senator from Missouri .
I was doing some searches this morning and I spotted a new type of Google AdWords video ad .
For example , a search on cell phones returns a video ad for BlackBerry .
Here are screen captures :
(1) The search results page :
(2) Zoom in on the ad on the right side of the page :
(3) Click watch demonstration :
(4) After the video is done playing , you can click on an in ad link to the advertiser 's landing page :
Other searches that seem to work include smart phones .
Here is the ad , again for BlackBerry , but this time it says " watch / hide commercial . "
So , clearly , BlackBerry is testing out the AdWords video ads .
Wonder if we can spot any other advertisers ?
FYI , what triggered me looking was the Yahoo video ads post from this morning .
Forum discussion at Search Engine Roundtable Forums .
Update : Just tried a search on phones and it showed a commercial in the top sponsored ads for AT&T Wireless :
Here is an video of the video ad , so you can see it live .
This one is from a search on laptop , which was spotted by Google Operating System .

Patrick and Susan did not know each other as children
The court ruled that the state was within its rights to protect " family order " and prevent the serious genetic illnesses that could arise from incest .
The man , identified as Patrick S , has already spent time in prison for incest but has been free pending his appeal .
He was adopted and only met his sister in 2000 when he met his birth mother .
The Federal Constitutional Court said the law against incest was in line with Germany 's constitution .
One judge dissented , however , saying the punishment must match the offence and that the law " is based exclusively on moral beliefs rather than with the objective of legal protection " .
' Consequences '
Patrick S has served more than two years of the two - and - a - half year sentence he was given in 2005 .
He now faces the possibility of returning to prison to serve out the remainder .
All but one of the couple 's children have been taken into care
His sister , Susan , was also convicted of incest and placed on probation for one year .
Patrick 's lawyer , Endrik Wilhelm , argued that the law against incest was a " historical relic " and the couple were doing no harm to others .
But the court said that sexual relations between siblings " do not affect them exclusively , but also can have an effect on family and society and have consequences for children who arise from the relationship " .
Patrick S , from Leipzig , was adopted when he was four years old and met his sister in 2000 when he tracked down his birth mother .
He was 24 at the time and she 16 .
Their four children are aged from six years to 34 months .
Three of them are in foster care .
Israel has been hit in recent years by thousands and thousands of rockets , mortar shells , and missiles .
And that could be just a preview of the onslaught Iran may one day unleash .
So Israeli military leaders have begun early planning for a new , robotic defense system , armed with enough artificial intelligence that it " could take over completely " from flesh - and - blood operators .
" It will be designed for ... autonomous operations , ' Brig .
Gen. Daniel Milo , commander of Israel 's air defense forces , tells * Defense News ' * Barbara Opall - Rome .
And in the event of a " doomsday " strike , Opall - Rome notes , the system could handle " attacks that exceed physiological limits of human command . "
How do you say " Skynet " in Hebrew , again ?
Israel already uses a blend of Arrow and Patriot interceptors to handle incoming rockets and missiles .
This new command - and - control program would be " superimposed over all those defenses " – and over new ones to come .
Experts here described the as - yet - unnamed system as a kind of supremely oriented , highly intuitive virtual coach - cum - battle manager whose primary mission would support system operators and commanders during engagements .
As such , the super system would help Israeli air defenders pick the optimum timing , sequence and targets for specific interceptors .
Air defense systems today often take a great deal of the work away from the troops who supposedly run them .
The machines automatically slew to their targets , lock on ... and then await instructions from flesh - and - blood .
At least they do , most of the time .
Back in October , however , some sort of glitch allowed a South African air defense cannon to spin out of control – killing 9 , and wounding 14 .
In *" * extreme scenarios , where the number of incoming weapons could overwhelm today ’s [ air defense ] systems and their human operators , [ Israel 's ] envisioned super system could take over completely , " Opall - Rome writes .
“ It will be designed for man - in - the - loop as well as autonomous operations , ” said Milo , the officer spearheading the vision within Israel ’s user community .
“ But right now , our emphasis is on algorithms , not autonomy .
Man -machine interface is the name of the game , because the more clever we make the interface , the more successful we ’ll be in providing operators and commanders the situational awareness they ’ll need to make very tough decisions ... ” *
“ Our approach can not be based exclusively on man - in - the - loop , nor can it rely only on the opposite .
Rather , we need to build an operational concept and a system that is flexible and situationally dependent , ” Milo said .**
In the future , and “ under very complex scenarios , ” Milo said , the envisioned super system would be able to generate a level of supreme situational awareness and snap intuitive capabilities that could surpass the very best wartime commanders .

“ We ’re talking about something that sees everything and calculates everything and makes decisions that can only be made through a real revolution in BMC4ISR [ Battle Management / Command , Control , Communications , Computers , Intelligence , Surveillance , and Reconnaissance ] ** , ” he said .
“ We ’re not there yet , and it could take a decade .
But this is our vision and we ’re running in that direction . ” *
UPDATE : As if on cue ...
Rafael Advanced Defense Systems , Israel 's arms development firm , unveiled plans for a new missile system Tuesday designed to intercept mid to long - range rockets and missiles of the kind used by Hezbollah during the Second Lebanon War .
The firm introduced the " Stunner " missile during a visit from Prime Minister Ehud Olmert , the Prime Minister 's Office said .
Jointly developed by Rafael and the U.S. defense contractor Raytheon as a counter to medium - range missiles and rockets , Stunner is likely to become operational in four years .
It will be incorporated into the new Magic Wand anti-missile system .
Because of the advanced technologies involved , the estimated cost of each individual missile is the relatively high sum of several hundred thousand dollars .
A defense source said Tuesday that the missile is meant to serve as the interceptor element of a defensive system called Magic Wand .
The system is meant to provide a defense against missiles and rockets whose range is between 40 and 250 kilometers , like Hezbollah 's Zilzal and Fajr missiles .
The first layer of this defensive structure will include Iron Dome , which Rafael is developing against Qassam and Katyusha rockets .
That system 's intercepting missile is dubbed Tamir .
Magic Wand and Iron Dome will complement the Arrow missile defense system , which intercepts long - range missiles and is already operational .
No word on thinking machines , though .

HANOI ( Reuters ) - Warming trends in a third of the world ’s large ocean regions are two to four times greater than previously reported averages , increasing the risk to marine life and fisheries , a U.N. - backed environmental study said .

Overfishing , coastal pollution and degradation of water quality were common in all 64 large marine ecosystems studied by scientists who contributed to the U.N. Environmental Program report presented at an international conference on oceans , coasts and islands in Vietnam this week .
“ These marine ecosystems are under great stress and that stress is increasing because of climate change , by global warming , ” co-author Ken Sherman of the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said in an interview .
“ We really need to have policy makers and donors recognize that we need to fund efforts to reduce the stress , ” Sherman said .
The report said that in 18 of the 64 regions , “ the accelerated warming trends are 2 - 4 times greater than the average trends reported in 2007 by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ” .
The week - long 4th global conference on oceans , coasts and islands in Hanoi is a forum for developing countries trying to improve ocean governance and coastal management , especially in the light of climate change .
U.S. academic and conference co-chair Biliana Cicin-Sain said there had been widespread changes in management of national jurisdiction .
“ But governance of the 64 percent of the ocean that lies beyond national jurisdiction remains largely sectoral based and fragmented , making it difficult to address the effects of uses . ”
RISK TO SUSTAINED TRADE
Scientists said the 800 - page report focuses on the risk to the sustainability of the $ 12.6 trillion value of goods and services produced each year in the so - called large marine ecosystems .
The most rapid warming was recorded in the Baltic Sea at 1.35 degrees Celsius in the past 25 years .
Other areas under threat included the Yellow Sea , one of the most heavily over - fished and environmentally degraded seas in the world .
Hundreds of millions people live along or near its shores in China and the Korean Peninsula and pollution from industry and farmland was a particular threat .
South Korean scientist Hyung Tack Huh said China , South Korea and North Korea were working together to work out and amend plans for managing the Yellow Sea coasts and environment .
The report recommended that 29 ocean areas adjacent to developing countries should also cap the yield of annual fishery catches as a precaution .
To help poorer nations better manage marine ecosystems , the Washington - based Global Environment Facility is funding projects worth $ 1.8 billion in 16 countries in Africa , Asia , Latin America and Eastern Europe .
Monique Barbut , chief executive officer of the GEF , said in an interview that oceans had been taken for granted in the global warming debate , including the Kyoto Protocol talks in Bali , Indonesia last year and the Convention on Biodiversity .
“ The message that has to be brought into the Bali roadmap and the follow up to the climate change talks is how all the international waters are ecosystems which suffer from climate change and the risks they are putting to world security , ” Barbut said .
“ Risks are increasing in terms of food security , immigration and diseases because of the non-protection of international waters . ”
About 190 nations agreed in Bali last year to launch two years of talks to work out a replacement for the Kyoto Protocol , which binds only rich nations to greenhouse gas emission curbs till 2012 .
Vietnam , which has a 3,200 km ( 2,000 miles ) coastline and one of the fastest - expanding economies in the world after China , is the first country outside of Europe to host the conference at which 430 delegates from about 70 countries are attending .
I 'm going to keep making this very basic point until Senators Clinton and McCain provide the same transparency as Obama .
It 's particularly important with the Clintons , whose massive increase in wealth in the last few years and past financial shenanigans demand a process of real vetting - a process they are unaccountably resisting .
And not a few days before the next critical primary .
Now .
We need time to ask all the right questions and for the press to do its job .
The returns are available unless they were n't filed .
So where are they ?
And when will the press do its job and demand either the returns or a half - way credible account of why they 're being withheld ?
So far , the Clintons are stalling and doing their usual wagon - circling .
Anyone who remembers the 1990s knows this is not a good sign .
I think they 're hoping that Obama will be destroyed and then they can blame the Republicans for re-booting Ken Starr .
We want to hear what you think about this article .

Opinion Apologists for Oppression : The Pernicious Cult of Media ' Experts '
As those justifying violence on the basis of security work to make the world increasingly unsafe , there seems an equally increasing need for a new kind of media that requires a new kind of ' expert ' .
By Ramzy Baroud
Published November 27 , 2007
What do an organic farmer from Spain , a union worker activist from Brazil and a human rights scholar living in London have in common ?
They are all individuals who affect substantive change in their communities and they are also individuals who are overlooked by the corporate media .
The latter has its own lists of ' experts ' - usually well - groomed males with little involvement in the daily struggles of the unseen and unheard multitudes of the world , yet able to influence their lives ( most often detrimentally ) from a well - guarded distance .
So how does the business of expertise work ?
Why are those actually qualified to address their own affairs so widely ignored by mainstream channels in favour of intellectual middlemen who purport to have some sort of legitimacy over a range of narratives , without any convincing credentials , let alone firsthand experience ?
The phenomenon precedes the advent of network television and satellite news .
It is embedded in a Western tradition that was formulated around imperial conquests : for a people to be conquered , they have to be understood in a language that prioritizes the interests of the colonialist over the rights of the colonised .
The latter 's identity is replaced by verbal and textual reductionism .
Thus Mohammed Abdullah Hassan , the Somali leader who strove for twenty years to free his people from British and Italian colonialism , was termed ' Mad Mullah ' by the British .
Hassan , of course , was as ' mad ' as Martin Luther King Jr , Mahatma Gandhi , Nelson Mandela and the vigorous leaders of numerous struggles around the world .
The list of these individuals is ever expanding , as activists are written off by those in power , those whose ' sanity ' preaches subscribing to the status quo and the inherent wisdom of the ' system ' .
This system serves not the majority of people living within it , but rather the combined interests of those with the money and those with the weapons : one funds the other 's military adventurism , and the other guarantees unhindered access to cheap supplies , labour and markets .
Without Bush 's war in Iraq , Blackwater could not generate over a billion dollars of extra contracts ; the relationship is painfully obvious .
Of course , neither Bush nor Blackwater executives are imprudent enough to speak of their real motives ; and it would be equally imprudent for us to trust that Blackwater 's ultimate objective is to contribute to the efforts of the US military to ' protect ' their country and its founding principles .
Unfortunately , though the deceptiveness of dominant rhetoric may often be apparent , when repeated numerous times to millions of people worldwide , it eventually gathers force , and even credibility .
The process has real and very deadly consequences : Blackwater mercenaries go on killing sprees ; endless media airtime is given to its executives and sympathetic ' experts ' who ' objectively ' defend their company 's image ; a congressional hearing of good cop / bad cop is held whereby one congressman thanks Blackwater for protecting the lives of Americans overseas while another gently reprimands it for not using extra care .
Extra care in gunning down innocent people ?
At this question the story is shelved .
By the time Blackwater kills again it is no longer even newsworthy .
Many far from credible ' experts ' are employed in this way to neutralize and effectually justify violence .
Their roles are those of apologists of state and corporate crimes , and as ideologues who tailor information to fit political and economic agendas .
They are dangerous because they have the leverage of being presented as impartial observers , even when their very identity should give away their partiality .
Benjamin Netanyahu has managed to reinvent himself to US publics as a ' terrorism expert ' , thanks to Fox News .
As for the former Israeli Prime Minister 's own crimes while in office , and his close ties to the neoconservatives ( the ' intellectuals ' behind the Iraq war ) and his persistent use of anti-peace language - these are unimportant diversions .
According to the corporate media and the selective samples of humanity they endlessly feature and tout for their ' expertise ' , the world is a convenient place that consists of big companies ( and no workers , thus no workers ' rights ) , prison guards ( no prisoners , thus no prisoners ' rights ) , war engineers ( no victims , thus no accountability ) and celebrities ( no ordinary people , thus no widespread and urgent grievances ) .
All those in brackets do n't exist as actual , living and breathing individuals ; they only exist as part of skewed narratives , designed carefully by an expert and a think tank .
That ' expert ' need not be there to understand , he needs only to speak in a language that manipulates prejudice .
The working women of India fighting globalisation , the lawyers of Pakistan fighting for judicial independence , the teachers of Palestine fighting for survival amid siege and boycott , the millions of uninsured Americans fighting for a doctor 's appointment - these people simply do n't exist as far as corporate media is concerned .
Or worse , they exist but do n't matter .
As those justifying violence on the basis of security , justice and democracy work to make the world increasingly unsafe , unjust and undemocratic , there seems an equally increasing need for a new kind of media , one that requires a new kind of ' expert ' .
When I contacted Noam Chomsky , John Pilger , Arun Ghandi , Ilan Pappe and many other intellectuals and activists from all over the world , proposing an alternative to ' expertise ' in the media , I did n't expect that just a year later the discussion could evolve into JUSTmedia ( JustMedia.net ) .
JUSTmedia is the first initiative to be launched by the People Media Project , a global scheme that hopes to offer a different kind of platform for discourse , dialogue and commentary by promoting the voices of people from all walks of life .
Supported by intellectuals who refuse to play by the roles of the ' mainstream ' , the idea is to extend a bridge across cultural , language , geographic and political divides to show and extend the possibilities of true democracy and human rights in the media .
They say it is better to light a candle than curse the darkness .
After much darkness and much cursing , another kind of candle may well be lit , one which only the efforts of ordinary people could keep alight .

On February 5 , the New York Times published a front - page story by Carlotta Gall and myself , Time Runs Out for an Afghan Held by the U.S. , about Abdul Razzaq Hekmati , a 68 - year old Afghan detainee who died in Guantánamo on December 30 , 2007 , in which we established that Mr. Hekmati , known to the authorities in Guantánamo as Abdul Razzak , had  contrary to assertions that he was involved in both al - Qaeda and the Taliban  helped free three significant anti-Taliban commanders from a Taliban jail in 1999 , but that no significant effort had been made in Guantánamo to find witnesses who could easily have verified his story , which he had repeated throughout his five - year detention without charge or trial .
In the wake of various right - wing claims that the journalistic integrity of the article was in doubt , following an " Editor ’s Note " issued by the Times , pointing out that I have described Guantánamo as part of " a cruel and misguided response by the Bush administration to the Sept. 11 attacks , " and that I have an " outspoken position on Guantánamo " and " a point of view , " I thought it might be prudent to relate a little of the background to the story , explaining its genesis , and directing readers to other sources to help verify the story reported by Carlotta and myself .
The story of Abdul Razzaq Hekmati had intrigued me while I was researching my book The Guantánamo Files : The Stories of the 774 Detainees in America ’s Illegal Prison , primarily because he had called Ismail Khan  who was exceedingly well known as the governor of the western Afghan province of Herat  as a witness in his Combatant Status Review Tribunal at Guantánamo .
These tribunals were established to review the detainees ’ status as " enemy combatants , " and were apparently empowered to call outside witnesses requested by the detainees , although as Carlotta and I reported , based on my research , on statements made last year by Lt. Col .
Stephen Abraham , who had served on the tribunals , and on a report compiled by the Seton Hall Law School ( PDF ) , no outside witnesses had ever been called to appear at a tribunal .
In Chapter 18 of The Guantánamo Files , I looked specifically at the US authorities ’ stated inability to locate witnesses requested by the detainees to appear at their tribunals to clear their names .
Because Ismail Khan was so famous , I mentioned the request made by a truck driver named Abdul Razzak , who claimed that he had freed Khan from a Taliban jail in 1999 , but had no time to research his story further .
Instead , after also mentioning a few more of the many Afghan detainees who beseeched the authorities to establish contact with officials in Afghanistan who could apparently vouch for them , I focused on the case of Abdullah Mujahid .
He had been cleared for release at the time I was writing the book , and was finally released from Guantánamo  only to end up being held without charge or trial in a US - run wing of Kabul ’s Pol - i - Charki prison  in December 2007 .
In Guantánamo , Mujahid persistently maintained that he had been working for the government of Hamid Karzai , and the authorities ’ alleged inability to find witnesses requested by him was demonstrated as a sham in June 2006 , when , in the space of 72 hours , the journalist Declan Walsh located three witnesses whom the authorities claimed to have been unable to contact : one was working in Washington DC , another was working for the Karzai government in Kabul , and the third was working for the provincial government in Gardez .
All three were able to verify his story .
When I read that Abdul Razzak had died of colorectal cancer in Guantánamo on December 30 , I was determined to see if I could find out anything more about his story , and Googled various variations of his name , and the events he had referred to , until finally , " ismail khan taliban jailbreak 1999 " led me to Dissension Within Taliban Made Daring Escape From Prison Possible , a New York Times article by Carlotta Gall , from January 2002 , which matched the account of the jailbreak described by Abdul Razzak in many ways .
Carlotta Gall interviewed the engineer of the prison escape , 21 - year old Hekmatullah Hekmati , who , as she described him , " was only a teenage Taliban intelligence officer , barely old enough to grow a beard , when he decided to help Ismail Khan . "
According to Hekmati ’s account , he had become " disillusioned by the Taliban , whom he saw as power hungry opportunists presenting themselves as religious students , and bad leaders , who were waging a brutal , ethnically motivated war against their countrymen . "
He decided that Khan , imprisoned , with 14 others , in the Kandahar prison that held the Taliban ’s most senior political and military prisoners , might provide a good alternative , having established himself as a " decent administrator " during his tenure as Herat ’s pre-Taliban governor .
" I thought he would work more for his country , if he were freed , " he told Carlotta Gall .
Having secured a job as an intelligence officer at the prison , through a relative , Hekmati said that he then set about persuading Khan that he was trustworthy .
Speaking to Carlotta Gall , Ismail Khan said , " We spoke to Hekmatullah for about a year about the escape .
Since he was such a powerful Talib he could easily come to my cell and speak to me .
I could not believe he could do it and that I could trust him . "
To prove that his intentions were sincere , Khan added that he told Hekmati that , " if he wanted to go ahead with the plan he should move his mother and brothers and sisters to Iran for safety , " and that when he did so he knew that the plan was real .
While Ismail Khan ’s son , Mirwais , and several of his cousins organized the escape , Hekmati acted as a go - between , delivering a letter to Khan outlining the plans .
In response , Khan said , he " pledged to provide the young man with a lifetime sinecure and arranged for a four - wheel - drive Land Cruiser to be sent to Kandahar for the escape . "
After discussing plans to free all 15 prisoners , the escape team settled on just three men  Khan , Haji Abdul Zahir , a commander from a famous Afghan family , and his cellmate from Jalalabad , General Qassim  and on the night of March 2 , 1999 , while the other guards slept , Hekmatullah Hekmati opened their cells and led them to a Land Cruiser parked outside , which had been adorned with the white flag of the Taliban .
After changing into the " black turbans and flowing robes that were the signature dress of the Taliban , " the escape party drove off , passing through checkpoints with ease .
They later got lost in the desert , and hit an anti-tank mine , which destroyed the vehicle and left both Ismail Khan and Hekmatullah Hekmati with " broken legs and open wounds , " but Hekmati ’s father , who had been driving the Land Cruiser , then " set off for help and after a four - hour walk north reached the front lines of Ismail Khan ’s own troops , who arranged a rescue . "
Although Carlotta Gall did not mention Abdul Razzak by name , it seemed probable to me that he was actually Hekmati ’s father , named as Abdul Raza Hekmati , who drove the escape vehicle and arranged for the rescue of Ismail Khan and his own son after the Land Cruiser hit the anti-tank mine .
The elder Hekmati evidently shared his son ’s disgust with the direction the Taliban was taking .
As Hekmatullah came up with his plans , Carlotta Gall noted , " The only other person he told was his father , who did not try to stop him but advised him to take it very slowly and carefully . "
In the various accounts that he gave in Guantánamo , Abdul Razzak credited himself with the motivation to free Ismail Khan , which his son claimed was his own idea , but in other crucial respects the story of the escape , as described by Hekmatullah Hekmati , matched Abdul Razzak ’s account exactly , not only in his various descriptions of himself as the driver of the escape vehicle , but also in his description of the incident with the anti-tank mine .
Explaining his role in the escape , Abdul Razzak said , " It was at night time .
I brought [ the ] Land Cruiser and I was waiting in a dark place .
My son did it , because he was in the intelligence and he was entrusted by the Taliban .
He took all three of them out and put them in the car and then we escaped . "
The following exchange from one of his military review boards is his take on the incident with the anti-tank mine :
Board Member : What happened to the Land Cruiser he purchased ?
Detainee ( through translator ) :
Hit a mine and my son ’s foot was amputated and my hand was broken .
It was destroyed .
After discovering this story , I contacted Carlotta Gall , who remembered that a friend of Hekmatullah ’s had told her that his father had been arrested and sent to Guantánamo , and that she had spoken about it to Haji Zahir , who was outraged and said that he would talk to the Americans about it .
With the truth established that Abdul Razzak was indeed Hekmatullah Hekmati ’s father , the story then took shape .
I provided Carlotta with information from his Combatant Status Review Tribunal ( CSRT ) and his Administrative Review Boards ( ARB ) at Guantánamo , from the statements of Lt. Col.
Stephen Abraham , and from the report by the Seton Hall Law School , and Carlotta tied the whole thing together , talking to key figures and securing poignant quotes from representatives of the US and Afghan governments , and from those who knew Mr. Hekmati .
I was particularly impressed with the comments made by Haji Zahir , who explained , " What he did was very important for all Afghan people who were against the Taliban , " adding , " He was not a man to take to Guantánamo .
He was a man to give a house to and support . "
Haji Zahir was even more significant than the final version of the article indicated .
His father , Haji Abdul Qadir , not only served as vice - president for six months in Hamid Karzai ’s first government , but was assassinated in July 2002 , and his uncle was Abdul Haq , a celebrated anti-Taliban commander who was killed by the Taliban in October 2001 .
Ironically , the void left by the death of Abdul Haq , who was described in an obituary in the Guardian as " one of the few homegrown political figures who could have restored unity to his benighted and wartorn country " raised the profile of another anti-Taliban Pashtun who had , until that point , struggled to establish himself in the south of the country .
That man was none other than Hamid Karzai .
This was not Haji Zahir ’s only claim to fame .
During the largely disastrous Tora Bora campaign in late November and early December 2001 , when Osama bin Laden , Ayman al - Zawahiri and many other senior figures in al - Qaeda and the Taliban escaped unscathed into Pakistan ’s largely autonomous border provinces  leaving numerous foot soldiers and fleeing civilians to be captured and sent to Guantánamo 
Zahir was widely regarded as the only trustworthy commander out of the three Afghan commanders chosen to lead the US Special Forces ’ proxy Afghan armies in the battle against bin Laden ’s men .
The other two commanders  the thuggish Hazrat Ali and the urbane smuggler Haji Zaman Ghamsharik  are discussed in Chapter 4 of my book .
Haji Zahir never made the final cut , but I noted in my first draft that he , and the 600 men he brought with him , were to prove themselves able fighters in the battle for Tora Bora , and I also quoted some perceptive comments that he made after the operation , when he explained to John F. Burns of the New York Times that he had pleaded with the Americans to block the trails to Pakistan .
" The Americans would not listen , " he said , " even when I told them that one word with me was worth more than $ 1 million of their high technology .
Their attitude was ,  We must kill the enemy , but we must remain absolutely safe . ’
This is crazy . "
I think Haji Zahir ’s significance  added to that of Ismail Khan  reinforces the importance of Abdul Razzaq Hekmati ’s role in striking a major blow against the Taliban , and I believe that it should make his lonely death , after being falsely imprisoned for five years by an administration that was blithely and cruelly unconcerned with establishing whether or not he had been captured by mistake , count for something more productive than a belated and much - needed epitaph .
This epitaph is clearly important for an innocent man who , even in death , had his name blackened by the people who had wrongly imprisoned him in the first place , and who let him die without having had an opportunity to clear his name , but what his story reveals about the many failures of Guantánamo should also resonate in the halls of power in Washington .
To this end I was pleased to note that , in an article in the Washington Independent on February 10 , Aziz Huq of the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU School of Law cited Mr. Hekmati ’s case as part of an argument aimed at the Supreme Court , which is currently deciding whether or not the Guantánamo detainees have a constitutional right to habeas corpus .
In the article , Aziz Huq asked the highest court in the land " to decide whether the role of the courts is to bless the errors and abuses of the executive  or whether it is the role of the courts , as a co-equal branch , to check error and reject lies . "
Discussing the failures of the current limited review of cases allowed by 2005 ’s Detainee Treatment Act , Aziz Huq wrote , " There are many reasons why the government might be resisting fuller review .
It could be that the government , as a matter of principle , believes it should have the power to lock up indefinitely anyone it deems is a terrorist - combatant .
It could be that it has tortured the detainees to get information .
It could be that it would rather let a man die of cancer in Guantánamo than follow its own leads to prove his actual innocence  that he had , in fact , fought against the Taliban . "
For further information on Abdul Razzaq Hekmati , I recommend the transcripts of his CSRT ( PDF , pp. 55 - 9 ) , his first round ARB ( PDF , pp. 272-85 ) and his second round ARB ( PDF , pp. 37 - 51 ) , which reveal even more of his story , to counter the administration ’s claims , after his death , that he was " assessed to be an experienced jihadist with command responsibilities , " and that he was also " assessed to have had multiple links to anti-coalition forces . "
Additional claims , not mentioned in the article , which were introduced in his ARBs  and which almost certainly came from dubious " confessions " made by other detainees  were that he was paid to smuggle 50 Arab family members out of Afghanistan and into Iran , that he was " knowledgeable of an assassination plot against President Karzai the day before it occurred , " and , most bizarrely of all , that he told another detainee that " there were still suicide pilots in the United States who could carry out their missions . "
A final allegation referred to his conduct in Guantánamo , where , it was claimed , he was " currently instructing others on how to resist interrogation tactics . "
As mentioned in the Times article , he refuted all the allegations against him , but his reason for denying the claim about his behavior in Guantánamo revealed explicitly how allegations in the prison have often arisen through conflict between the detainees .
He explained that this particular false allegation arose because a Tajik detainee , who had lived in an adjacent cell for a month , had " started fighting " with him and had falsely accused him .
Also not mentioned in the article was a specific and rather telling comment about the Taliban ’s connections with Pakistan .
After explaining that he was driven to take part in the jailbreak because of his opposition to the Taliban ’s " ruthlessness and injustice , " he stated his belief that , when Ismail Khan was governor , " the whole area was peaceful and all the money coming through the province was safe , " whereas the Taliban " were disbursing money to Pakistan and just wasting money . "
He also included additional information about the time that he spent in exile in Iran after the jailbreak ( before returning to Afghanistan to be handed over to unquestioning US forces by a personal enemy ) , when the Taliban offered a substantial reward for his capture .
He explained that , because he was protected by Burhanuddin Rabbani ’s governing council ( the official anti-Taliban government - in - exile in northern Afghanistan , which was recognized as legitimate by most of the western world , including the United States ) , he fled to Iran with his family , where he was provided with a house and financial support , and where , in addition , his neighbor was Ismail Khan .
" They gave me the house he ( Khan ) used to live in , and Khan took another house , " he explained .
" We had a family relationship .
They invited us to their house and we invited them to our home .
We would eat food and then they would go back home . "
The final word on this shameful story  for now , at least  must go to the Guantánamo spokesman , Navy Cmdr .
Rick Haupt , who admitted that he " did not know " if Mr. Hekmati " was allowed any final contact " with his family before he died .
This seems extremely unlikely , as Mr. Hekmati himself explained , in the last of his fruitless military reviews in 2006 , that after nearly four years in US custody he had not received a single letter from his family , and did not even know where they were .
So much for justice .
Iowa Representative Leonard Boswell quietly added his name as the 25th cosigner of House Resolution 333 on Valentine ’s Day , February 14th , joining the rising call for the impeachment of Vice President Richard B. Cheney .
Boswell is the first name added this year , as the most recent Representative to add her name was Wisconsin ’s Gwen Moore , who signed on December 19th .
Representative Boswell is a member of the powerful House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence – the primary committee in the U.S. House of Representatives charged with the oversight of the United States Intelligence Community .
Boswell ’s signing may be indicative of Congress beginning to shift in the direction of holding the Vice President and other Bush Administration officials more strictly accountable for the 935 lies documented by The Center for Public Integrity during their heavy push to war prior to the invasion and occupation of Iraq .

In a few milliseconds my brain made the connection and I had one of those “ so that is where it came from ! ” moments .
When I was in Silicon Valley last week , I had the privilege of taking a tour of the Computer History Museum .
One of the stops was in front of these hanging grids :
I had no idea what they were .
My friendly tour guide , Fred Ware , told me that I was looking at “ core memory . ”
It was an early form of memory technology that used small holes , or cores , through which wires were inserted .
This setup allowed the machine to control the polarity of the magnetic field created and thereby store data inside of them .
When I first started programming on a Unix machine in college , I would occasionally do something stupid like try to peek at the contents at memory address zero which would do bad things , cause a crash , and give me a “ core dump . ”
I had always assumed that the “ core ” referred to in the error message was an adjective for “ main , ” but when I saw real “ core memory , ” I realized that I had misunderstood the term for years .
Our industry is full of terms that seem awkward unless you know their history .
Even basic things like the “ print ” method in almost all languages does n’t make much sense unless you see that it goes back to the days when you connected to a computer via a TeleTYpe ( TTY ) machine that printed its result on rolled paper .
This is n’t unique to computing .
Human languages have quite a bit of history in their words .
For example , the word “ salary ” comes from the bygone days when you were paid for your labor in salt .
The difference with computing history is that most of it happened recently and most of the people that created it are still alive .
Great stories are just below the surface of things you use each day .
While I knew that Linux is a Unix - like operating system that was started by Linus Torvalds when he was a student the University of Helsinki , I did n’t realize until last week the interesting story of “ Unix ” itself .
The name probably came about as a result of a silly pun .
It was a “ castrated ” version of MULTICS .
The MULTICS operating system was developed in the mid 1960 ’s to be a better time - sharing operating system for the expensive computer time of the day .
Perhaps frustrated with the complexity of MUTLICS , Ken Thompson wrote a rough “ simplified ” version of it in a month .
Thus , the story goes , it was “ UNIplexed ” and simpler where MULTICS was “ MULTiplexed ” and complicated .
Unix ’s history gives color to the people that created it .
I ’m certainly no Ken , but I can relate to the feeling that some code seems overly complex and feel the itch to rewrite it to something simpler .
It ’s neat to see that his diversion worked out so well .
It ’s also a testament to the people behind MULTICS that most of the central ideas in our “ modern ” operating systems trace their origin to it .
Programming languages tend to have a story as well .
Usually the most interesting is the philosophy that drove their creation .
A good representative sample is the philosophical gap between Simula and C ++.
Simula is regarded as the first object - oriented programming language .
It too was developed in the golden era of Computer Science in the 1960’s .
As stated by its creators :
“ From the very outset SIMULA was regarded as a system description language ”
This naturally led to the bold design objective # 6 :
“ It should be problem - oriented and not computer - oriented , even if this implies an appreciable increase in the amount of work which has to be done by the computer . ”
It was so bold , that they had to tone it down a bit .
They still had 1960 ’s hardware after all :
“ Another reason for the [ de - emphasizing the above goal ] was that we realized that the success of SIMULA would , regardless of our insistence on the importance of problem orientation , to a large to a large extent depend upon its compile and run time efficiency as a programming language . ”
Regardless , it ’s telling of its philosophy .
As David West writes :
“ Both Parnas and the SIMULA team point to an important principle .
Decomposition into subunits is necessary before we can understand , model , and build software components .
If that decomposition is based on a ‘ natural ’ partitioning of the domain , the resultant models and software components will be significantly simpler to implement and will , almost as a side effect , promote other objectives such as operational efficiency and communication elegance .
If instead , decomposition is based on ‘ artificial , ’ or computer - derived , abstractions such as memory structures , operations , or functions ( as a package of operations ) , the opposite results will accrue . ”
As David continues , the philosophy of Simula was :
” … to make it easier to describe natural systems and simulate them in software , even if that meant the computer had to do more work . ”
Bjarne Stroustrup took a different approach with C++:
“ SIMULA ’s class - based type system was a huge plus , but its run-time performance was hopeless :
The poor runtime characteristics were a function of the language and its implementation .
The overhead problems were fundamental to SIMULA and could not be remedied .
The cost arose from several language features and their interactions : run-time type checking , guaranteed initialization of variables , concurrency support , and garbage collection … ” ( Emphasis added )
“ C with Classes [ precursor to C++ ] was explicitly designed to allow better organization of programs ; ‘ computation ’ was considered a problem solved by C.
I was very concerned that improved program structure was not achieved at the expense of run-time overhead compared to C. ” ( Emphasis added )
This simple historical account alone can probably guide you to answers to things that seem odd or annoying about C++.
It also reveals a larger truth .
Usually if someone way smarter than me , like Bjarne , creates or does something that I think is weird , there ’s probably an interesting historical reason behind it .
In C++ , the driving force was almost always performance .
I find it amusing that a lot of the “ new ” ideas in languages and runtimes are just bringing back things from Simula that C++ took out .
Practicalities like performance often hinder the adoption of otherwise superior technology .
Betamax lost because it only held an hour of video compared to VHS ’s three .
Not being able to store a full length movie is a real problem .
The QWERTY keyboard layout was designed in the 1860 ’s when it was important to separate common letter pairs like “ th ” in order to prevent typebar jamming .
When computer keyboards were designed , the designers simply copied the already popular QWERTY layout to ease adoption even though other , potentially more efficient , layouts were available .
Sometimes a “ good enough ” solution wins because the better approach is n’t worth the transition cost .
Popular history often misleads people into thinking that things came easily to the innovators .
The real stories offer hope because they demonstrate that you too can make history if you ’re willing to persevere .
Google ’s founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin were turned down when they tried to sell their core PageRank algorithm to AltaVista and Yahoo .
One of my favorite stories is that almost no one believed Bob Kahn , the inventor of TCP , when he advocated that congestion control would be important on a large network .
It was n’t until the first 12 packets were sent out and congestion actually occurred did people finally agree that it could be a problem .
Probably the biggest misconception is how Isaac Newton came to explain gravity .
Scott Berkun writes :
“ It ’s disputed whether Newton ever observed an apple fall .
He certainly was never struck by one , unless there ’s secret evidence of fraternity food fights while he was studying in Cambridge .
Even if the apple incident took place , the telling of the story discounts Newton ’s 20 years of work to explain gravity , the feat that earned him the attention of the world ” ( Emphasis added )
Tim Berners - Lee , the primary man behind the web , tells a similar story :
“ Journalists have always asked me what the crucial idea was or what the singular event was that allowed the Web to exist one day when it had n’t before .
They are frustrated when I tell them there was no Eureka moment .
It was not like the legendary apple falling on Newton ’s head to demonstrate the concept of gravity … it was a process of accretion ( growth by gradual addition ) . ”
What ’s the history lesson ?
Do n’t worry if you never have an apple falling on your head moment .
Newton did n’t have one either .
Things take a lot of hard work and perseverance .
True stories of innovator ’s persistence go on and on .
While you ’re slogging away , do n’t worry about mistakes too much :
“ Anyone who was never made a mistake has never tried anything new . ” - Einstein
Simply learn from them and move on .
Although doing something insanely great might take a long time , it demonstrates how important people are in our industry .
People are the most important part of any industry because it is through them and their stories that history is created .
People are especially important in computing .
Unfortunately , some of their most interesting stories are practically unknown by most :
Alan Turing wrote the paper that effectively started computing as we know it .
William Shockley practically put the “ silicon ” in “ Silicon Valley , ”
Our modern Internet exists in large part because of the fascinating story of J.C.R.
Licklider who used ARPA funding to work on his dream that everyone should have a personal computer connected to an “ Intergalactic Computer Network . ”
Bob Taylor , the man that led the wildly successful Xerox Palo Alto Research Center ( PARC ) inspired creativity in the great people that worked with him by creating environment that encouraged exploration and laughter .
Dave Cutler was in large part the reason why we have the much more reliable NT kernel running on our computers and are n’t stuck with “ toy ” Windows 9 x one .
Their stories are full of little gems .
You sometimes get to see what drove their curiosity .
Bob Barton , arguably one of the greatest hardware designers ever , made the comment “ I often thank IBM because they gave me so much motivation to do better . ”
I ’m sure that Google ’s founders could say the same thing about AltaVista of the 1990’s .
I think that one of the reasons for the plummeting enrollment in Computer Science majors is that there is a lack of understand of people and their stories in our field .
This leads to the perception that a career in computing will result in a “ social death . ”
I might be biased , but I think we have great stories .
If you have n’t visited it yet , check out the videos on the Computer History Museum section on YouTube .
They ’re quite interesting .
I ’ll close with one lesson from computing history : do n’t be afraid to dream big .
When Vint Cerf had to put an upper limit in 1977 on the number of addresses for what would become the Internet , he probably thought that 4 billion addresses would never be used , but that ’s the “ address exhaustion ” problem that we ’re facing now .
Be careful when creating something , it just might exceed your wildest dreams .
Why do we as an industry largely ignore our history and rarely mine its rich stories ?
Do we think we ’re moving too fast for it to be relevant ?
I think that it ’s important to understand our history exactly because we ’re moving so fast .
It seems that learning principles that are timeless or much longer lived is more valuable than keeping up with the deep intricacies of the latest technology of the day that wo n’t matter in a year or two .
What ’s your favorite piece of computing history ?
Who are the people that you remember ?
What are their stories ?
P.S. Special thanks to Alan Kay for sharing some of his stories with me last week .
The Constitution protects individuals against unreasonable searches , but for this protection to have practical meaning , the courts must enforce it .
This week , the Supreme Court let stand a disturbing ruling out of California that allows law enforcement to barge into people ’s homes without a warrant .
The case has not prompted much outrage , perhaps because the people whose privacy is being invaded are welfare recipients , but it is a serious setback for the privacy rights of all Americans .
San Diego County ’s district attorney has a program called Project 100 % that is intended to reduce welfare fraud .
Applicants for welfare benefits are visited by law enforcement agents , who show up unannounced and examine the family ’s home , including the insides of cabinets and closets .
Applicants who refuse to let the agents in are generally denied benefits .
The program does not meet the standards set out by the Fourth Amendment .
For a search to be reasonable , there generally must be some kind of individualized suspicion of wrongdoing .
These searches are done in the homes of people who have merely applied for welfare and have done nothing to arouse suspicion .
The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit , based in San Francisco , rejected a challenge brought by welfare recipients .
In ruling that the program does not violate the Constitution , the majority made the bizarre assertion that the home visits are not “ searches . ”
Sep 26 , 2020 · The Beijing Bay was the name that The Pirate Bay temporarily used for a period of time in 2008 , after the International Olympic Committee asked the Swedish government to shut down The Pirate Bay web site .
The reason behind this was - the International Olympic Committee explained - that just in one day , there were more than 1 million downloads ...
“ In this industry , if you ’re making 4 percent profits , you ’re held in high esteem , ” said Jim O’Neal , chairman of the Truckload Carriers Association .
“ Now we ’re looking at the dreaded stagflation : a soft economy and increasing prices on everything , especially fuel . ”
Some causes of the run-up are seasonal , said Ron Planting , an economist at the American Petroleum Institute .
For instance , home heating oil and diesel are close cousins , and when heating - oil demand goes up in the winter , the prices of both fuels often rise .
But other reasons are relatively new .
The rising popularity of diesel vehicles in Europe increases demand for the fuel and decreases demand for gasoline , allowing European refiners to export their surplus to the United States , which helps stabilize gasoline prices here , Mr. Planting said .
Diesel use is on the rise in fast - growing countries like India and China , Mr. Kloza said .
And even in the United States , demand for diesel and heating oil grew 1.5 percent in 2007 , compared with 0.4 percent for gasoline , Mr. Planting said .
Americans burned about 142 billion gallons of gasoline and about 65 billion gallons of diesel and heating oil in 2007 , according to data from the Energy Information Administration .
Diesel is mostly burned by businesses to power machinery or haul freight , Mr. Planting said .
Since few of the functions dependent on diesel are discretionary , companies must pay the higher prices to remain in business .
“ In the U.S. , gasoline is having its little run , ” Mr. Kloza said .
“ But diesel is much more of a global market .
All the signs say that the world ’s appetite for diesel is only going up . ”
Rising fuel costs come at a difficult time for America ’s transport companies , already hit by slumps in new home construction and consumer spending .
Truck tonnage fell 1.5 percent in 2007 , to just under 11 billion tons , said Bob Costello , chief economist of the American Trucking Association .
Rising diesel costs will almost certainly lead to higher consumer prices and more bankruptcies , he said .

Newton Virus by Troika from Dezeen on Vimeo .
Newton Virus is a computer virus designed by London collective Troika , that causes icons on your computer desktop to fall towards the ground as if affected by gravity .
The non-destructive virus is transferred to a colleague 's Mac via a specially designed USB device ( above ) .
Newton Virus , created in 2005 , is on show at the Design and the Elastic Mind exhibition at MoMA in New York until May 12 .
The movie shown here has not been seen before .
Here 's some info from Troika :
--
NEWTON VIRUS
In the beginning were harmless computer viruses .
Viruses born out of the wit of early computer adopters , viruses whose sole purpose was to surprise and amuse .
A non-destructive form of artificial life .
We wanted to revive this golden era , and went on to create our first computer virus .
We chose to do it for mac as the platform is still a virgin territory ;-)
Spice up your colleagues ' day with our Newton Virus , the first virus to introduce gravity to your laptop , causing the desktop icons to fall down as if subject to the gravitational pull from the real world .
Newton Virus comes on a USB key for manual infection .
Simply plug the key into a computer and the virus will automatically copy itself on the hard drive .
The virus will then hit at random , but only once .
It will not replicate itself , mail itself to your friends or destroy any of your files , but instead provides you with moments of blissful surprise and magic .
Clinton gave three reasons for his military intervention in the heart of Europe .
A quick look shows them to be models of the state disinformation we ’ve come to expect in wartime .
First , he says he is dropping bombs to prevent the spread of war .
But this is straight out of Orwell .
Escalating war does not prevent its spread .
It encourages it .
It brings about more property destruction , suffering , and death .
It inflames tempers , entrenches positions , sows indelible hatreds , and draws others into long - lasting conflicts .
Third , Clinton says he wants to underscore the credibility of Nato .
The truth is that Nato has had no credibility since the collapse of the Cold War took away its official reason for existence .
The entire world now sees this organization for what it is — a fig leaf for U.S. imperialism .
Nato has become a threat to peace in Europe because the U.S. believes Nato must fight wars to preserve U.S. hegemony .
The conflict in Kosovo comes down to this : Serbia believes that the territory belongs to it , and bases this claim on history dating back 600 years .
Serbia cites the presence of ancient churches and monasteries central to the Serbian Orthodox faith in Kosovo , which in turn are wrapped up tightly with Serbian nationalist feelings .
On the other hand , Kosovo is today inhabited by a Moslem population that demands the right to self - determination .
Which principle should prevail : the claims of history or the political rights of the majority in a polyglot territory ?
Look at American history .
Both the claims of history and the rights of the majority were solidly in favor of Southern secession .
But the U.S. decided on union by force .
Ever since then , the U.S. has generally opposed secession , not only at home but around the world .
The U.S. tried to keep the Soviet Union together when Latvians , Lithuanians , Ukranians , Estonians , and all the rest were demanding the right of independence .
In the same way , the US backed unitary Nigerian , Congolese , and Rwandan states against tribal secessionist impulses .
Currently , the U.S. backs Britain against the claims of Irish and Scottish nationalism , France against Breton and Corsican nationalism , Italy against Lombardian nationalism , Spain against Catalan nationalism , Russia against Chechnyan nationalism , and Mexico against secessionists in Chiapas .
Will the U.S. now reverse its current position against all these regional majorities subjugated by alien nation states ?
Only during the First World War did the U.S. back self - determination , when the fanatical Woodrow Wilson used this venerable principle as a weapon against the multinational monarchies he was dead - set on destroying .
It was political propaganda , both then and now .
The Clinton administration says it supports the Kosovo Liberation Army .
In truth , this support is narrow and temporary .
The analogy is the support the U.S. provided to the Kurds in Iraq .
This support was quickly withdrawn when the U.S. believed it had achieved its real objective , which was to punish anyone who dared question the right of the U.S. to run the world .
The hypocrisy is nowhere as clear as in U.S. opposition to Kurdish demands for separation from the Turkish government .
The U.S. sees Turkey as a reliable vassal , so the U.S. turns a blind eye to ethnic oppression of the most brutal sort .
It turns out , then , that the principle is not that downtrodden ethnic groups ought to have autonomy , but that the U.S. ought to manage the entire map of the world .
And how well does the U.S. do this ?
In the same region the U.S. is now bombing , the Clinton administration enforced a unified , multicultural Bosnia , where U.S. troops are permanently stationed , against the pleas of every ethnic group that resides there for independence .
This is the peace of a prison camp .
It also deprived Serbia of an area with a Serbian majority , an act which inflamed the present crisis .
Ironically , Bosnia also provides a model for what the U.S. would like to do across the region — become an occupying force that overrides everyone else ’s rights at the point of a gun .
The U.S. government has come to view itself as a god - like figure that will purge the entire world of ancient claims and prejudices , and selectively impose a deracinated ideology of democratic equality .
This is nothing short of millennialist insanity .
So who is right in the present dispute ?
The Kosovo independence movement that claims to be speak on behalf of the Moslem majority , or the Milosevic government that claims to represent the Christian Serbian majority ’s desire for a Serbian - controlled province ?
The short answer is : this is not for the U.S. government to decide .
Indeed , the U.S. has no position that squares with reality .
It says that Kosovo should be neither independent nor Serbian .
The “ peace agreement ” Clinton hails was nothing but blanket permission for Nato as a permanent occupying force , which is why Milosevic rejected it .
But Clinton says if he does n’t drop bombs and settle border disputes , we would repeat the errors of the past .
Really ?
It was US involvement in Europe that turned a limited conflict into a global one in the First World War .
The later attempt to punish its opponents and redraw borders helped bring Hitler to power .
And it was U.S. refusal to choose diplomacy over terror that deepened and widened another ghastly global bloodbath , to be followed again by a disastrous redrawing of borders and the fastening of communism on half of Europe .
Yet here we go again , imposing sanctions , lobbing bombs , and redrawing maps .
We are not learning from the errors of the past but repeating them .
Clinton ’s missiles have already caused irreparable damage .
Orthodox Christians are horrified that the US would back the claims of Moslems , and we can now add Serbians to the growing list of groups that have sworn eternal enmity to the U.S. world empire .
When we consider the original American vision — of a peaceful , commercial republic would be a beacon of freedom , trading with all and staying out of the endless quarrels of the Old World — we can only be utterly alienated from the regime that rules a country conceived in liberty .
It is clearer than ever that the U.S. warfare state must be dismantled , so that it can no longer threaten the world , or trample on true American ideals .

Jason Robbins and Jenan Wise have released a new Ajax source code browser for Google Code project hosting :
We recently launched a new source code browsing tool as part of Google Code ’s project hosting feature .
This new tool makes it easy to navigate through a project ’s Subversion repository .
Key features include : fast directory browsing tree , syntax highlighting , history of changes , and easy - to - read diffs .
See it yourself under the “ Source ” tab of any project that we host .
The new system certainly feels fast , and uses jQuery to flip around in short order , jumping through the revisions of your system , expanding into new directories , etc .
This change required a change to my Google Code greasemonkey script that adds a direct link to the trunk .
It now takes you right to the trunk of the code in the new browser !

Adm. Fallon ’s ( forced ? ) resignation was the last warning we are likely to get of an attack on Iran .
It does not mean an attack is certain , but the U.S. could not attack Iran so long as he was the Centcom commander .
That obstacle is now gone .
Vice President Cheney ’s Middle East tour is another indicator .
According to a report in The American Conservative , on his previous trip Cheney told our allies , including the Saudis , that Bush would attack Iran before the end of his term .
If that report was correct , then his current tour might have the purpose of telling them when it is coming .
Why not just do that through the State Department ?
State may not be in the loop , nor all of DOD for that matter .
The State Department , OSD , the intelligence agencies , the Army , and the Marine Corps are all opposed to war with Iran .
Of the armed services , only the Air Force reportedly is in favor , seeking an opportunity to show what air power can do .
As always , it neglects to inform the decision - makers what it cannot do .
The purpose of this column is not to warn of an imminent assault on Iran , though personally I think it is coming , and soon .
Rather , it is to warn of a possible consequence of such an attack .
Let me state it here , again , as plainly as I can : an American attack on Iran could cost us the whole army we now have in Iraq .
Lots of people in Washington are pondering possible consequences of an air and missile assault on Iran , but few if any have thought about this one .
The American military ’s endless “ we ’re the greatest ” propaganda has convinced most people that the U.S. armed forces cannot be beaten in the field .
They are the last in a long line of armies that could not be beaten , until they were .
Here ’s roughly how it might play out .
In response to American air and missile strikes on military targets inside Iran , Iran moves to cut the supply lines coming up from the south through the Persian Gulf ( can anyone in the Pentagon guess why it ’s called that ? ) and Kuwait on which most U.S. Army units in Iraq depend ( the Marines get most of their stuff through Jordan ) .
It does so by hitting shipping in the Gulf , mining key choke points , and destroying the port facilities we depend on , mostly through sabotage .
It also hits oil production and export facilities in the Gulf region , as a decoy : we focus most of our response on protecting the oil , not guarding our Army ’s supply lines .
Simultaneously , Iran activates the Shi’ite militias to cut the roads that lead from Kuwait to Baghdad .
Both the Mahdi Army and the Badr Brigades  the latter now supposedly our allies  enter the war against us with their full strength .
Ayatollah Sistani , an Iranian , calls on all Iraqi Shi’ites to fight the Americans wherever they find them .
Instead of fighting the 20 percent of Iraq ’s population that is Sunni , we find ourselves battling the 60 percent that is Shi’ite .
Worse , the Shi’ites ’ logistics lie directly across those logistics lines coming up from Kuwait .
U.S. Army forces in Iraq begin to run out of supplies , especially POL ( petroleum , oil , lubricants ) , of which they consume a vast amount .
Once they are largely immobilized by lack of fuel , and the region gets some bad weather that keeps our aircraft grounded or at least blind , Iran sends two to four regular army armor and mech divisions across the border .
Their objective is to pocket American forces in and around Baghdad .
The U.S. military in Iraq is all spread out in penny packets fighting insurgents .
We have no field army there anymore .
We cannot reconcentrate because we ’re out of gas and Shi’ite guerrillas control the roads .
What units do n’t get overrun by Iranian armor or Shi’ite militia end up in the Baghdad Kessel .
Gen. Petraeus calls President Bush and repeats the famous words of Ducrot at Sedan : Nous sommes dans un pot de chambre , et nous y serons emmerdés .
Bush thinks he ’s overheard Petraeus ordering dinner  as , for Bush , he has .
U.S. Marines in Iraq , who are mostly in Anbar province , are the only force we have left .
Their lines of supply and retreat through Jordan are intact .
The local Sunnis want to join them in fighting the hated Persians .
What do they do at that point ?
Good question .
How probable is all this ?
I ca n’t answer that .
Unfortunately , the people in Washington who should be able to answer it are not asking it .
They need to start doing so , now .
It is imperative that we have an up - to - date plan for dealing with this contingency .
That plan must not depend on air power to rescue our Army .
Air power always promises more than it can deliver .
As I have warned before , every American ground unit in Iraq needs its own plan to get itself out of the country using only its own resources and whatever it can scrounge locally .
Retreat to the north , through Kurdistan into Turkey , will be the only alternative open to most U.S. Army units , other than ending up in an Iranian POW camp .
Even if the probability of the above scenario is low , we still need to take it with the utmost seriousness because the consequences would be so vast .
If the United States lost the army it has in Iraq , we would never recover from the defeat .
It would be another Adrianople , another Manzikert , another Rocroi .
Given the many other ways we now resemble Imperial Spain , the last analogy may be the most telling .
I have said all this before , in previous columns and elsewhere .
If I sound like Cassandra on this point , remember that events ended up proving her right .
Why do we need Web Hosting Reviews ?
All review websites pledge to provide unbiased reviews or evaluation to their guests .
Their research is based on pre-determined services and opportunities .
The websites themselves lay down these professional standards for carrying out such research .
It is regrettable that most review websites have different standards .
Such websites are not licensed and most of them run for promotions or for promoters .
They display their might on the basis of aggregate subscribed members .
They do n’t necessarily uphold any professional standards like educational or character qualifications for such membership .
Increase in membership indicates their growth and development .
There is no doubt that these review websites show a stirring desire to exchange information .
This aids in progress in the field of hosting .
Due to conservatism and rigidity in the conduct of hosting companies , the flexibility of reviewing industry is inhibited .
These companies are generally authoritarian in administration .
Companies want to have their say in presenting information to the visitors , without adhering to any advice related to policies .
On the opposite , reviewing websites aim for extensive readership .
Websites appreciate review comments from visitors , thus allowing free expression .
Such literature is the index of public interest , self - consciousness , and growing status .
The content posted is useful and forms a firm basis for the advancement of hosting industry .
Website content spreads fast and they have become material for knowing what customer wants and expects from hosting company .
There are so many web hosting providers available but to find the best and secure ones , various features should be possess by the web hosting providers , which indicate that they are trustworthy , best and safe to use .
Features which make web hosting providers best
Required amount of storage and bandwidth per month
All the web hosts providers offer you certain amount of storage and bandwidth , as per their different plans , but may be you need high storage capacity and high bandwidth for your site to run , so you should go for that Web hosts provider , which offers you the required plan , as per your need and thus web hosts providers which fulfill your need is termed as best .
Provide you required databases and programming languages
Most of the web hosts providers provide you with required databases and programming languages but the best one provide you the same with specific tools and versions you want to use .
The setup used by majority of hosts consisting of a Linux or Unix - like operating system , a MySQL database , and a PHP or Perl programming language which is not likely to support Web sites created in ASP or ColdFusion .
Thus , before choosing the web hosts provider first check this before you sign up .
Provide you with basic statistics
You should go for that web hosting provider which can provide you online reports about your site , of basic statistics like how many visitors visit your site daily , where they came from , what activity is performed by them on your site , how much time they spend on site etc .
This information is quite useful because it will help you to know your customer ’s taste , preferences , like , dislike etchant accordingly you can prepare your business strategy .
Upgradeable hosting plan
Best web hosts provider provide you with upgradeable hosting plans so if you move further to your present hosting plan or if your site becomes more complex and you feel that you need more storage , bandwidth , or flexibility , then through this hosting plan , all can be done .
Email accounts
Good web hosts providers provide you with few email accounts , which contain the same , features as your website and by these accounts you can send and receive email through a Web interface or it will allow you to download your messages into Outlook or other standards - based email clients .
The best provider will provide you best quality in terms of virus and spam protection and in Web - based email administration tools .
Best Customer service
Customer service is one of the most important features , which keeps trust of the customers in the company .
If customer is not satisfied with your service or facing problems again and again , then it is possible that he or she will not use your service in present / future and you may loose your customers , which affect your business also .
Thus your customer service should be best , so that customers always retain with you .

Reports that a phial containing the foot - and - mouth virus went missing from the Porton Down research laboratories have been raised at a public inquiry into the disease .
Northumberland County Council is hosting the five - day investigation into the spread of the virus and how rural communities were affected .
Professor Michael Dower , leading the inquiry , said he was still waiting to hear from the government regarding the matter .
He wrote to rural affairs minister Lord Whitty on January 8 with a list of questions which had arisen from information the inquiry had received locally .
Professor Dower asked : " What forewarning did the Ministry of Agriculture ( Maff ) have of a possible foot - and - mouth outbreak prior to the outbreak in February ?
" Several of the written submissions the inquiry received refer to reports of a lost phial of foot - and - mouth virus from Porton Down , " he said .
Professor Dower said there had been reports that the disease was present in the country before it was officially admitted .
There were also " reports that Maff officials were taking preparatory steps ( eg making inquiries of timber merchants , taking part in simulation exercises , printing of `footpath closed ' notices etc ) before the outbreak of the disease was officially announced . "
" Can you confirm or deny these reports or provide any further detail ? "
Economy ' ravaged '
The chairman hoped to have a reply before the end of the week - long inquiry .
Farmers on Monday told the inquiry team how the disease had ravaged the local economy .
Iain Robson , a farmer and butcher from the Kirkwhelpington area , had farmed through two previous foot - and - mouth outbreaks in 1960 - 1 and 1967 .
" The impact of this one has been far , far greater , " he told the hearing .
Doug Watkin , a stockman and county councillor from the Norham area , saw his livestock culled in April .
He said : " I lost a lifetime of work in a short time . "
After he lost his animals , he said it was difficult to face other farmers .
Charles Scott , head of the Farm Business Survey Centre for Rural Economy , worked on producing a report for the regional development agency One NorthEast which has initially found that farmers whose animals were culled lost an average of £ 60,000 and received £ 80 - £ 120,000 compensation .
But Mr Scott said farmers who had had culls had lost an average of £ 15,000 due to increased costs and movement restrictions .
The news keeps coming in , and examples of how real science works ( as opposed to make believe creationism or so - called intelligent design ) are beginning to get so numerous that it is hard to imagine people capable of reading newspaper articles are still capable of denying evolution .
Last month , for instance , a spectacular discovery was published in Nature magazine , a finding that has resolved a long - standing question about the evolution of bats .
Darwin listed the problem as one of the great mysteries of evolution he was not able to address in “ The Origin of Species ” : how did bats originate from terrestrial ancestors ?
The modern version of the conundrum hinged , until last month , on whether flight or echolocation ( the amazing ability of bats to generate a sonar - like pulse to orient themselves and locate preys ) came first .
For decades biologists have been arguing in favor of either the flight - first or the echolocation - first hypothesis .
There were reasonable arguments on either side : we know of the existence of some modern shrews that have a rudimentary system of echolocation , lending credence to the possibility that echolocation came first , as a means to locate prey on the ground first , and perhaps in arboreal environments later .
On the other hand , in the 1980s , studies showed that terrestrial echolocation is extremely expensive metabolically , and that it can be sustained easily by the animal only in flight ( because the same muscles used to power flight also generate the sound waves , at little additional energetic cost ) .
Still , the problem remained unsolved because all fossil bats known ( until last week ) were clearly capable of echolocation ( we can tell from the size of the cochlea inside their ears ) and capable of powered flight ( as judged by their skeletal structure ) .
But that is what ’s truly amazing about science : you can literally wake up one morning and find that someone has figured out the answer to a question that has vexed people for decades , sometimes centuries .
In this instance , work by N.B. Simmons and collaborators has unearthed two specimens of bats that are 52.5 million years old ( as close as we ’ve gotten so far to the time scientists think bats originated from terrestrial ancestors ) .
The stupendous fossils clearly show that the animals were capable of flight , but their cochleae simply could not have allowed echolocation .
Mystery solved : flight came first !
But , the sensible reader might say , how did bats start to fly in the dark without echolocation ?
Would n’t they be literally bumping into things in the night ?
The currently favored hypothesis is that bats began to fly as diurnal animals , and were eventually pushed into a nocturnal habit by increased competition from birds , after the dinosaurs ’ demise 65 million years ago .
This hypothesis makes a very specific prediction about the structure of the eye sockets of early bats , which are expected to be different between diurnal and nocturnal animals .
Unfortunately , the two specimens studied by Simmons and colleagues have their upper skulls crushed , so that it is n’t possible to reconstruct the eye sockets .
Science solved a mystery , only to run immediately into a new one .
But of course , next week , or next year , someone may find a new fossil that will settle this question too , and so on and so forth .
Now , when was the last time a creationist discovered something that settled a scientific dispute ?
Did n’t think so .
New U.S. single - family home sales slumped to a 13 - year low in January and demand for durable goods declined more than expected , government data showed Wednesday , fueling fears of a recession .
The reports bolstered expectations of more interest rate cuts when the Federal Reserve ’s policy - setting committee meets next month .
New single - family home sales fell 2.8 % in January to the lowest rate since February 1995 , while the median sales price slipped , according to the Commerce Department .
New home sales fell to an annual rate of 588,000 from an upwardly revised rate of 605,000 in December .
Economists expected a 600,000 rate , according to Reuters survey .

In a separate report , the Commerce Department said new orders for durable U.S. - made manufactured goods fell 5.3 % , the biggest drop in five months and more than analysts had expected .
A key gauge of business spending also declined , though the 1.4 % drop was less than the 2 % decrease that Wall Street analysts had forecast .
“ The data suggest that capital spending is stalling , and possibly receding , in the first quarter as weak domestic demand starts to overshadow still - healthy foreign sales , ” said Sal Guatieri at BMO Capital Markets .
“ Businesses cut payrolls at the start of the year , so it ’s unlikely that they boosted capital spending , especially with the economic climate souring by the day , ” he said .
Still , some economists took solace in the fact that shipments rose , perhaps a sign of continued strength in the U.S. export sector , which has benefited from a weak dollar .
That should buffer the U.S. economy , even as domestic demand ebbs .
“ The U.S. economy has entered a period of very sluggish growth , ” said Harm Bandholz , economist at UniCredit in New York .
“ A weaker profit outlook and tighter access to credit will dampen business fixed investment throughout the entire year .
But we still do not think that the U.S. economy will fall into an outright recession . ”

The first pictures have emerged from inside a massive party where 2,000 gatecrashers arrived after a Radio 1 DJ mentioned it on air .
Thousands of revellers descended on the country manor , smashing windows , ripping up carpets , destroying chandeliers and ripping doors off their hinges .
Grammar - school girl Sarah Ruscoe had invited fellow sixth - formers to the fancy - dress event at her 21 - bedroom family home , and was said to be " inconsolable " when 2,000 gatecrashers arrived after Radio 1 DJ Pete Tong mentioned it on his programme .

Chaos :
The party - goers rip apart a sofa
Today Rebecca Brooks ,
Sarah 's mother said that parties at the mansion for her three daughters - who are 24 , 17 and 19 - would definitely be a thing of the past .
" The daughters will not be having anymore parties here , " she said .
" That is off the agenda for the next 10 years .
" The daughter is in the doghouse but I do n't blame her entirely .
" I blame the modern means of communication .
" She feels terrible , she is absolutely mortified by the whole thing . "
The party hostess : Sarah Ruscoe in her dominatrix outfit
But yesterday Sarah admitted she had known the party would get out
of hand and chose not to warn
her mother of what might happen on
Friday night .
Sarah , who dressed as a dominatrix
for the evening , said it had become
clear to her that crowds would
descend on her Georgian mansion ,
Colehayes , near Bovey Tracey in
Devon .
The house , in 20 acres , is used as a field
study centre for schools and universities
and is also a popular venue for weddings
and parties .
It is run by Sarah 's mother
and stepfather , Rebecca and Bill
Brooks , and has accommodation for 70
plus a licensed bar .
" To say things got out of hand is
probably an understatement , " said
Sarah , who is not 18 until October
but decided to have her party early
after a booking for Colehayes was
cancelled .
" I put up a poster at school inviting
everyone " .
Little did I know that
almost everyone from Torquay Grammar
sixth form would attend and
invite " everyone " from different
schools and the surrounding area .
" A large circle of friends , social networking
sites and even the radio
make communication that much
more efficient . "
She continued : " I soon realised it
was spiralling out of control but tried
to reassure myself with the fact that
people can decide for various reasons
not to attend .
" I spread rumours in
other schools that the party was cancelled ,
which obviously did n't work .
" By the last day I felt physically ill
with worry but chose to keep my
mother in denial for her own sake .
" Nothing could be done at this
point .
I was dreading the night but
did n't expect it to turn out as bad as
it did .
" When it seemed like people
would never stop coming and there
was a line of headlights up our drive ,
I knew how out of hand it really had
become .

I did n't
want to see and just wanted to go
straight to bed but she insisted . "

When police arrived at the house
they were pelted with glass as they
tried to get the revellers to leave .
The family had hired four bouncers
for the evening but Mrs Brooks , 54 ,
said they did not stand a chance
against the invading hordes .
" I can only liken it to a rock festival .
They were jumping up an down with
cans and bottles , spraying them
around as if they were at a rave .

It was not until they brought the dogs in that they all dispersed
The revellers :

But there was no music because the DJ we
had hired did not even get a chance to
set up .
" The people that came were a bunch
of strangers behaving like they
had been invited because Pete Tong
had told them that everyone was welcome .
" Half of them arrived here
drunk – there were girls walking
around with bottles of vodka , drinking
them like normal people drink
bottles of Coke .
It was awash with
alcohol .
And they were smoking
cannabis spliffs .

Mirrors were smashed and pictures torn off the walls as the party got out of hand .
Bouncers hired by the family were said to have ' no chance '
" Some people were taking pictures
off the walls and just breaking them .
" I just do n't know what gets into
these people .
They began behaving
like animals .
" One charcoal portrait of my husband 's
great grandfather was just
smashed .
It is a family heirloom with
enormous sentimental value .
" We saw
various garments everywhere –
trousers , knickers and underpants .
I
was also told there were streakers
down the drive .

Hundreds of gatecrashers turned up uninvited at the family 's manor house Colehayes Park in Newton Abbot
The sumptuous interior of the huge house was left in tatters
She and her 75 - year - old husband
are considering suing the BBC
for allowing details of the party to
be broadcast across the nation –
especially if it affects their business .
Tong 's mention of it was an
example of what is known on the
programme as a " shout - out " .
The 47 - year - old DJ 's name is popular
rhyming slang for " gone wrong " , as in
" It 's all gone Pete Tong " .
He told listeners : " We 're getting
ready for a huge mansion - house
party , 500 plus people going .
It 's in
Bovey Tracey , Devon .
" Anyone who's
listening can come along apparently –
just say Hi to Marilyn Monroe on the
door . "

Rubbish was strewn throughout the house
The carpets were ruined and picture frames smashed
Mrs Brooks said : " I was flabbergasted
and astonished that the BBC
could be so irresponsible .
I was
aghast at Pete Tong .
" I am furious and beside myself with
anger and rage .
The BBC are going to
seriously have to look at their policy .
" This is ridiculous .
This was supposed
to be a party for all my daughter 's
schoolfriends and it should not have
been announced on Radio One .
Damage : Bottles fill bins and recycling containers
" I 'm amazed that the BBC has not
been in touch to apologise and I am
expecting an apology from Pete Tong
in a personal phone call .
" It was totally negligent of the BBC
to allow a statement like that to be
broadcast "
A BBC spokesman said : " Pete did
not specify the name or address of
the venue , but read out details of a
mansion party taking place in Bovey
Tracey sent in by a listener .
" He gives shout - outs on his show
every week and he would never knowingly
give an identifiable address for a
private party .
" It 's also worth noting
that details of the party appear to
have been posted on the internet several
days before the party . "
The American fascists are most easily recognized by their deliberate perversion of truth and fact .
Their newspapers and propaganda carefully cultivate every fissure of disunity , every crack in the common front against fascism .
- Henry A. Wallace
In this dark period of the American experiment when the cats feet of creeping fascism grow louder by the day it is important to look to our history for those who offered up warning signs of what was to come .
I would like to recognize former Vice President Henry A. Wallace for his outspoken warnings of the potential for the rise of American fascism .
In retrospect and on careful analysis of the post WWII years we have seen an incremental process in which these fascist elements have slowly executed their plan to seize the country .
The creation of the CIA , the McCarthy years during which the real left was beaten back and degraded as a political force , the gradual and growing influence of the military industrial complex , the creation of a massive , well - funded infrastructure of think tanks and media shills , the hijacking of religion , the dumbing down of Americans through incessant propaganda , the destruction of the quality of education available in public schools , the erosion of worker ’s rights as well as globalist ‘ free trade ’ pacts that would facilitate the looting of the fascist oligarchs and finally the stripping away of American civil liberties by a rogue administration who seized power illegitimately have seen that Wallace ’s warnings went unheeded .
I would strongly recommend that people take a look at Naomi Wolf ’s excellent article for The Guardian entitled Fascist America , in 10 easy steps which removes all doubt as to the very dark road that we as a nation are headed lest we draw upon the wisdom of those from the past who tried to warn us , men like Henry A. Wallace .
The Danger of American Fascism
By Henry A. Wallace
The New York Times , Sunday 09 April 1944
On returning from my trip to the West in February , I received a request from The New York Times to write a piece answering the following questions :
What is a fascist ?
How many fascists have we ?
How dangerous are they ?
A fascist is one whose lust for money or power is combined with such an intensity of intolerance toward those of other races , parties , classes , religions , cultures , regions or nations as to make him ruthless in his use of deceit or violence to attain his ends .
The supreme god of a fascist , to which his ends are directed , may be money or power ; may be a race or a class ; may be a military , clique or an economic group ; or may be a culture , religion , or a political party .
The perfect type of fascist throughout recent centuries has been the Prussian Junker , who developed such hatred for other races and such allegiance to a military clique as to make him willing at all times to engage in any degree of deceit and violence necessary to place his culture and race astride the world .
In every big nation of the world are at least a few people who have the fascist temperament .
Every Jew - baiter , every Catholic hater , is a fascist at heart .
The hoodlums who have been desecrating churches , cathedrals and synagogues in some of our larger cities are ripe material for fascist leadership .
The obvious types of American fascists are dealt with on the air and in the press .
These demagogues and stooges are fronts for others .
Dangerous as these people may be , they are not so significant as thousands of other people who have never been mentioned .
The really dangerous American fascists are not those who are hooked up directly or indirectly with the Axis .
The FBI has its finger on those .
The dangerous American fascist is the man who wants to do in the United States in an American way what Hitler did in Germany in a Prussian way .
The American fascist would prefer not to use violence .
His method is to poison the channels of public information .
With a fascist the problem is never how best to present the truth to the public but how best to use the news to deceive the public into giving the fascist and his group more money or more power .
If we define an American fascist as one who in case of conflict puts money and power ahead of human beings , then there are undoubtedly several million fascists in the United States .
There are probably several hundred thousand if we narrow the definition to include only those who in their search for money and power are ruthless and deceitful .
Most American fascists are enthusiastically supporting the war effort .
They are doing this even in those cases where they hope to have profitable connections with German chemical firms after the war ends .
They are patriotic in time of war because it is to their interest to be so , but in time of peace they follow power and the dollar wherever they may lead .
American fascism will not be really dangerous until there is a purposeful coalition among the cartelists , the deliberate poisoners of public information , and those who stand for the K.K.K. type of demagoguery .
The European brand of fascism will probably present its most serious postwar threat to us via Latin America .
The effect of the war has been to raise the cost of living in most Latin American countries much faster than the wages of labor .
The fascists in most Latin American countries tell the people that the reason their wages will not buy as much in the way of goods is because of Yankee imperialism .
The fascists in Latin America learn to speak and act like natives .
Our chemical and other manufacturing concerns are all too often ready to let the Germans have Latin American markets , provided the American companies can work out an arrangement which will enable them to charge high prices to the consumer inside the United States .
Following this war , technology will have reached such a point that it will be possible for Germans , using South America as a base , to cause us much more difficulty in World War III than they did in World War II .
The military and landowning cliques in many South American countries will find it attractive financially to work with German fascist concerns as well as expedient from the standpoint of temporary power politics .

A few months back , I noticed that McCain was displaying involuntary motor activity where his left hand was uncontrollably shaking while giving a speech behind a podium .
Usually , as it was explained to me , this is indicative of a breakdown taking place within the person 's central nervous system , that is exhibiting the aforementioned symptoms .
Then I read the enclosed and my cause for concern appears to have been further validated .

Green Zone Follies BAGHDAD --
" There is nothing new here to report .
The troops are clearing out one nest of patriots only to have them move down the road .
The DoD is fudging on the death tolls and they never mention the lunatics , the drug use or the semi-mutinous grunts , the constant attacks on the Green Zone with mortars and rockets and so on , and on .
I am considered useful so I get to stay here .
At least I get good food and relative safety unlike the foot troops .
Now , the nutty Cheney wants to hive off more troops to invade Pakistan to help out their vanishing dictator .
Never happen , Dick .
And here is just a personal vignette of an experience I and my psychologist buddy had with the Republican probable nominee , Senator McCain .
He came here , as you might know , to " inspect the situation . "
Jesus , what a farce !
There he was , walking around a marketplace with more armed guards than Bush has , and wearing a huge bullet - proof vest .
Anyway , after he " inspected " the market , he came to the Green Zone for some rigged conference with the lying generals .
My buddy and I were going to visit another friend when we saw guards , etc , in front of a rec room door .
Curious , we went into another unguarded room , opened several doors and guess what ?
There was the Senator all by himself , sitting on a folding chair by a card table .
We were a little awed so I said ' Hello , Senator .
Sorry to bother you . "
He looked at us like we were cows and kept blinking .
Finally , he smiled and said , ' Hey , there , soldiers !
How is it going ?
Is it going good ? " and my friend the shrink said , " Why yes , Senator .
Everything is great ! "
And McCain smiled at nothing and looked around the room .
" WellI 'm glad to hear it .
You are the General ? "
And I said , a little sarcastically , " Why no , Senator , not quite yet . "
And he looked at me like I was a sheep or something , smiling a silly smile .
" Oh " he said to the table , " Let 's hope it gets a little cooler here .
Have you been here long ? "
My friend said , " Too long Senator . "
" Why that 's good , General , " the Senator replied to the ceiling .
Then his lips moved but he said nothing .
He looked up and smiled .
( My wife 's grandfather did just that . )
And the Senator may have been sitting right near us but believe me , he was somewhere else .
Then he began a conversation with someone who was n't there and my friend took my arm and said , " I think we should get the hell out of here , " and we started to go back the way we came when some civilian came in .
" It 's time to go to the meeting , John , " but McCain just smiled and kept on talking to the table .
The civilian said , " All right , gentlemen , time to go .
The Senator is very tired and has jet lag . "
And when we left , the Senator was talking complete nonsense .
Later , one of the staff personnel told both of us that the Senator had " a little accident " and he had to change his pants .
Jesus H. Christ !
This nut is going to be a President ?
My friend , who is a pro , said he was very obviously suffering from pre-Alzheimer 's and believe me , although I am not trained , this one was a pure space case .
They must know this .
I guess they give him a shot of something before he gets out in public but if you saw him with a vacant stare , talking to himself , you would not have to be a professional shrink to know that putting this pathetic man into the Oval Office would be a worse mistake than putting Bush in .
At least as far as we know , Bush does n't talk to the walls and wet himself . "

Researchers at Duke University have demonstrated that monkeys have the ability to perform mental addition .
In fact , monkeys performed about as well as college students given the same test .
The findings shed light on the shared evolutionary origins of arithmetic ability in humans and non-human animals , according to Assistant Professor Elizabeth Brannon , Ph.D. and Jessica Cantlon , Ph.D. , of the Duke Center for Cognitive Neuroscience .
Current evidence has shown that both humans and animals have the ability to mentally represent and compare numbers .
For instance , animals , infants and adults can discriminate between four objects and eight objects .
However , until now it was unclear whether animals could perform mental arithmetic .
“ We know that animals can recognize quantities , but there is less evidence for their ability to carry out explicit mathematical tasks , such as addition , ” said graduate student Jessica Cantlon .
“ Our study shows that they can . ”
Cantlon and Brannon set up an experiment in which macaque monkeys were placed in front of a computer touch screen displaying a variable number of dots .
Those dots were then removed and a new screen appeared with a different number of dots .
A third screen then appeared displaying two boxes ; one containing the sum of the first two sets of dots and one containing a different number .
The monkeys were rewarded for touching the box containing the correct sum of the sets .
The same test was presented to college students , who were asked to choose the correct sum without counting the individual dots .
While the college students were correct 94 percent the time and the monkeys 76 percent , the average response time for both monkeys and humans was about one second .
Interestingly , both the monkeys ’ and the college students ’ performance worsened when the two choice boxes were close in number .
“ If the correct sum was 11 and the box with the incorrect number held 12 dots , both monkeys and the college students took longer to answer and had more errors .
We call this the ratio effect , ” explained Cantlon .
“ What ’s remarkable is that both species suffered from the ratio effect at virtually the same rate . ”
That monkeys and humans share the ability to add suggests that basic arithmetic may be part of our shared evolutionary past .
Humans have added language and writing to their repertoire , which undoubtedly changes the way we represent numbers .
“ Much of adult humans ’ mathematical capacity lies in their ability to represent numerical concepts using symbolic language .
A monkey ca n’t tell the difference between 2000 and 2001 objects , for instance .
However , our work has shown that both humans and monkeys can mentally manipulate representations of number to generate approximate sums of individual objects , ” says Brannon .

The Texas House passed HB 2017 on 13 April 2007 .
Both HB 993 and HB 996 would move the Texas Presidential and General Primary from the first Tuesday March ( 4 March 2008 ) to the first Tuesday in February ( 5 February 2008 ) .
The bill passed the Senate State Affairs committee 6 - 3 on 8 May 2007 .
These bills died when the Texas Legislature adjourned in May 2007 .
TEXAS DELEGATE SELECTIION PLAN FOR THE 2008 DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL CONVENTION ISSUED BY THE TEXAS DEMOCRATIC PARTY AUGUST 2007 The Texas Democratic Party excluded Congressman Dennis Kucinich from the primary ballot because he refused to sign an oath saying he would fully support the eventual Democratic nominee for president .
Certified returns from vote from an official source .
Here is how we compute the DISTRICT delegate count ( based on certified returns for the 4 March 2008 primary from an official source ) : A candidate must receive 15 % or more of the total popular vote to qualify for delegates .
Discard votes cast for those candidates who do not qualify .
Allocate Senatorial District delegates from the qualified vote in each district .
In each jurisdiction ( CD and statewide ) : Total qualified vote = total votes cast for the qualifying candidates in the jurisdiction .
Allocation = ( delegates for the jurisdiction ) × ( candidate 's popular vote ) ÷ ( total qualified vote ) .
Assign each candidate the WHOLE NUMBER of delegates .
If delegates remain , allocate each of the remaining delegates to those candidates with the LARGEST REMAINDERS .

A few months before I accepted a Wolfram Research internship — around March — I was very fearful , and so was the majority of the world .
We knew very little about the novel coronavirus , and the data was just not robust .
In addition to the limited data we had , the scientific process necessarily takes time , so even that was not used to its full extent .
In a world where not enough data can quickly become data overload , the question did n’t seem to be finding more data , but rather how can one extract useful and meaningful information from the available data ?
A worldwide pandemic is definitely stressful , but a worldwide pandemic without accessible and computable information is much more so .
Using Wolfram technologies in coordination with several internal teams , I created a Wolfram U course called COVID - 19 Data Analysis and Visualization to try and cut through the informational fog and find some clarity .
I saw this course as one that gives power to everyone to be able to look at data and gain insight .
After all , data is knowledge , and knowledge is power .

The coming shift to digital from analog TV does n't need to be an anti-environmental boondoggle for the consumer - electronics industry .
The Federal Communications Commission
is changing our national television transmission next year from an analog signal to a digital one , saying the move will free up airwaves for police and fire transmissions .
The home - entertainment industry , meanwhile , is creating a lot of ballyhoo around the transition to hawk new products and services .
The Consumer Electronics Association released a consumer survey back in
December
, showing that 50 % of U.S. households now own a digital television .
The association self - servingly predicts that 32 million more digital TVs will ship this year and estimates that 79 % of those will be high - definition .
A slowing economy , of course , could quickly take the rosy tinge off of those very optimistic statistics .
Even so , that 's potentially a lot of older televisions being retired in a short time .
The
EPA says
that the cathode ray tubes in conventional TVs contain enough lead to classify them as hazardous waste .
It 's worth putting some thought into whether to replace your old set and how to do so responsibly .
And if you do upgrade , remember that getting rid of the old one in an eco-sensitive way requires more care than simply carting it to the curb .
Here are some things to consider on the eve of the digital revolution :
You do n't actually have to replace your television .
If you are one of the 58 % of television owners who have subscription television , you have no worries .
Cable providers such as
Time Warner
( TWX )
and
Comcast
( CMCSA ) - Get Report
already deliver their programming via a digital signal .
Satellite services like the
Dish Network
( DISH ) - Get Report
and
Directv
( DTV )
do , too .
If you do n't do cable , you can buy a digital converter box at stores like
Best Buy
( BBY ) - Get Report
and
Circuit City
( CC ) - Get Report
for between $ 40 and $ 70 .
The Department of Commerce is even offering $ 40
coupons
to mostly defray that cost .
If you do indulge in a fabulous new TV you can do it in an eco-friendly way by paying attention to energy efficiency and other details .
Start by taking the Sierra Club's
Green Screen quiz
, a quick 10 - question exercise that will tell you all kinds of things you did n't know about television technology and energy consumption .
LCD screens are the most energy - efficient , for example , but that does n't mean that all upgrades to LCDs are eco-friendly .
If you trade in a modest 20 - inch cathode - ray TV for a whopping 42 - inch flat screen , it 's the equivalent of upgrading from a conventional sedan to a Hybrid SUV :
While your choice might be efficient for its size , you 're still using more energy than you were before .
Energy Star
provides buying guidelines and lists the TVs that meet its standards , which include using 30 % less energy than regular TVs .
If you want to go further ,
MyGreenElectronics
lists televisions by brand and model number and points out their green credentials , such as energy efficiency , resource conservation , use of recyclable materials or the reduced use of hazardous materials .
After buying your new TV , try to recycle your old set .
Television makers lag computer companies in setting up programs to take back their own goods .
But programs are slowly coming online .
Sony
( SNE ) - Get Report
will take back its electronics including TVs , via a program is has with
Waste Management
( WMI ) .
It seems to be a work in progress .
MyGreenElectronics
had a more exhaustive list of drop - off locations than
Sony's
own Web site .
Sharp , Panasonic and Toshiba have formed a
recycling joint venture
that at the moment recycles televisions in Minnesota .
The venture is supposed to expand over this year and next to include Connecticut , North Carolina , Oregon , Texas and Washington .
Royal Philips Electronics
( PHG ) - Get Report
is one of several TV makers that are still recycling holdouts , a stance Greenpeace drew attention at the end of March , when it posted a
giant robot
made from electronic trash outside of the Dutch company 's shareholder meeting .
Other groups are picking up some of the manufacturers ' slack .
Office Depot
( ODP ) - Get Report
sells
recycling boxes
for $ 5 to $ 15 that you can fill with electronics including TVs and bring to your local store outlet .
And several environmental and anti-waste Web sites can help you find a free recycling program near you , including
Earth911
, the
National Center for Electronics Recycling
and the
Electronics Takeback Coalition
, which makes recyclers take a pledge of environmental responsibility .
One of the advantages of digital TV is , of course , a cleaner picture with sharper color .
With just a little responsible consumerism you 'll be able to clearly see the green in yours .

WASHINGTON —
The most revealing indicator of the state of our democracy is not to be found in the snowdrifts of New Hampshire but in the marbled chamber of the U.S. Supreme Court .
Soon enough , we will discover whether the court under Chief Justice John Roberts will become a partisan tool in the national Republican drive to place constraints on voting that are targeted at those who tend to support Democrats .
Not since the Supreme Court stopped the Florida presidential election recount in 2000 has a voting case been so significant , or so overflowing with partisan bile .
On Wednesday , the justices will hear a challenge to Indiana ’s strict law requiring photo identification in order for a voter to cast a ballot at the polls .
The state claims the law is necessary to stop voter fraud .
Yet no one — not Indiana officials , not the U.S. Justice Department , which has taken the state ’s side in the dispute , nor any commission — has come up with a single case in the state ’s history in which an impostor showed up and cast a vote .
Never mind .
In 2005 , Republicans who controlled the Indiana Legislature and the governor ’s mansion imposed the toughest photo identification requirement in the nation .
Not coincidentally , studies have repeatedly shown that those least likely to possess photo identification — most commonly a driver ’s license — are African - Americans , the poor , the elderly and the disabled .
In short , they are more likely to vote Democratic .
Challengers to the law have identified at least two Indiana voters who have infirmities that make it impossible for them to drive , according to The New York Times .
They were prevented from casting ballots and having them counted after years of voting without difficulty .
Though the state set up a way for those without a license to obtain a photo ID , the process is complex , and eligible voters still can be denied .
If , for example , a woman produces a birth certificate bearing her maiden name , rather than the married name under which she is registered to vote , she is n’t entitled to the identification .
About 60 percent of those who have tried to get alternative IDs have been turned down , according to briefs filed with the Supreme Court .
To make their case before a court that is supposed to decide matters based on the facts and the law , Indiana and its supporters , including the Justice Department , invoke a compendium of allegations of this type of voter fraud or that .
Facts seem to be notable for their absence .
The allegations they cite involve mostly news accounts of absentee ballot fraud , inaccurate registration rolls , and even tampering by election officials or poll workers .
None of them would be prevented by requiring a photo ID from a voter .
None involve an impostor who showed up and claimed to be someone else — the only type of fraud that requiring a photo ID would prevent .
“ They ’re not only newspaper articles , but they ’re generally newspaper articles about allegations that a photo ID law would not prevent , ” said Justin Levitt , counsel to the Brennan Center for Justice , which has filed a friend - of - court brief challenging the Indiana requirement .
The Justice Department is a party to this embarrassment , including in its brief an example of absentee ballot fraud in a mayoral primary .
But the Indiana ID law has no bearing on absentee voters .
The state still allows absentee ballots to be counted without a photo ID , on the basis of a signature checked against registration rolls .
Still , the department argues that the mere “ temptation ” of voter fraud and the possibility of “ undetected ” wrongdoing is sufficient to support a law that constrains some legitimate voters from casting a ballot in person .
If this sounds remarkably similar to arguments some Republican officials made against certain U.S. attorneys — that they failed to prosecute “ voter fraud ” cases that turned out to be figments of the partisan imagination — that ’s because it is .
The voter identification proposals fare best in states where Republicans control legislatures and hold the governor ’s office .
They have been upheld on the votes of Republican judges , and over the objection of Democratic ones .
Partisan motives are supposed to have no part in the administration of free and fair elections .
That is what the United States preaches abroad and what most Americans believed before Florida 2000 .
We can believe it again only if this Supreme Court rejects the hollow rhetoric of partisans and upholds the rights of all voters .

( CNN ) --
While all three presidential candidates are locked in a dead heat in potential matchups , a new CNN / Opinion Research Corporation poll suggests voters see major differences in each of their personal qualities .
A new poll shows a majority of Americans say Barack Obama will bring about change .
When it comes to bringing about change , a majority of Americans -- 56 percent -- say Sen.
Barack Obama will be able to achieve that task ; 49 percent say the same for Sen.
Hillary Clinton ; and 39 percent say that for Sen. John McCain .
Survey respondents also ranked the Illinois senator highest -- 65 percent -- when asked who would work with both parties to get things done , compared with 56 percent who say McCain would and 52 percent who say Clinton would .
But Obama is also the only candidate who a majority of Americans -- roughly 60 percent -- say does not have the right experience to be president , the poll showed .
That number is significantly higher than the 38 percent who say Clinton is n't experienced enough and the 31 percent who say the same for McCain .
The poll also indicates that the Democrats may have the advantage on the issues most important to voters .
Well over 50 percent report Obama and Clinton agree with them on the important issues , but only 39 percent say the same about McCain .
Watch how the economy is affecting the race »
McCain also does the poorest among the poll 's participants when asked if the candidate cares about people like them : 51 percent said McCain did , compared with 55 percent who said the same of Clinton and 67 percent who said Obama cared about them .
" In some cases , there is a striking contrast between the John McCain of 2000 , when he first ran for president , and the John McCain of today , " CNN polling director Keating Holland said .
" During the GOP primary season eight years ago , 52 percent of all Americans said that McCain agreed with them on important issues .
...
That figure is down [ Tuesday ] to 39 percent . "
Those surveyed also give the lowest marks -- 50 percent -- to McCain when asked if they'd be proud to have him as president .
Clinton came in with 57 percent , and Obama garnered 62 percent .
The poll showed that 65 percent of Americans view the Arizona senator as a strong and decisive leader , compared with 63 percent who say the same of Clinton and the 59 percent for Obama .
While all three candidates have laid out clear visions for the country , Obama gets the highest mark in that category .
Just over 70 percent say Obama has a clear vision , 69 percent say Clinton does , and 59 percent say the same for McCain .
The poll surveyed 1,019 adult Americans on March 14 - 16 and carries a margin of error of plus or minus 4.5 percentage points .

The global coronavirus pandemic of 2020 is unlike anything most of us have experienced .
The most effective method of fighting this invisible threat is by social distancing , which , unfortunately , has shut down much of the world ’s economy and has forced many into under or unemployment , significantly reducing their income .
The U.S. government has taken emergency action to provide many low - and middle - income citizens with a stimulus check to help them bridge this income gap .
The Coronavirus Aid , Relief and Economic Security ( CARES )
Act , a $ 2 trillion dollar stimulus bill , includes provisions that will send adult Americans a check for $ 1,200 , married couples $ 2,400 , and an additional $ 500 per child under the age of 17 .
This article covers everything you need to know about the 2020 stimulus check , including who is eligible , when you will receive it , whether you have to pay it back , and more .
Who is Eligible for the 2020 Stimulus Check ?
There are several eligibility requirements people must meet in order to be eligible for the stimulus check .
They can be broken down into two main criteria – age & citizenship requirements , and income eligibility .
Age & Citizenship Eligibility Requirements
There are several important notes regarding stimulus check eligibility :
Citizenship Eligibility :
The stimulus checks are only available to taxpayers with a Social Security Number .
It is not available to taxpayers with an ITIN ( Individual Taxpayer Identification Number ) .
This excludes many taxpayers who are not U.S. citizens .
: The stimulus checks are only available to taxpayers with a Social Security Number .
It is not available to taxpayers with an ITIN ( Individual Taxpayer Identification Number ) .
This excludes many taxpayers who are not U.S. citizens .
Qualifying Ages for Children : Children ages 16 and under are eligible for an additional $ 500 on their parents ’ or guardians ’ tax return .
Children who are ages 17 and older and are a dependent on another person ’s tax return are not eligible for this stimulus check .
This cuts out a number of high school and college - age workers .
Income - based Stimulus Check Eligibility Requirements
If you meet the citizenship and age requirements , you must still meet the income eligibility .
This is based on your Adjusted Gross Income ( AGI ) from the most recent tax year you filed taxes .
So if you have already filed taxes in 2019 , then the IRS will use the AGI from your 2019 tax return .
If not , then they will use your 2018 tax return .
If you have not yet filed your 2019 tax return ( the deadline has been automatically extended until July 15 , 2020 ) , then you can delay filing your taxes if your AGI from 2019 will exceed the limit and your 2018 AGI qualifies .
Conversely , if you exceeded the income limit in 2018 , but will not in 2019 , then you should file ASAP .
Note for this who do n’t normally file tax returns :
You will still be eligible for the stimulus check if you do not file a tax return because your income is too low of your income to not taxable .
We cover this in more detail below .
Individual Taxpayer Stimulus Check Income Limits :
Individual taxpayers are eligible for the full amount of the stimulus payment if their AGI was less than $ 75,000 .
The Stimulus Check payment phases out starting at $ 75,000 through $ 99,000 .
Individual taxpayers who had an AGI greater than $ 99,000 will not be eligible for the stimulus check .
Taxpayers will receive an additional $ 500 for each qualifying child ages 16 and under .
Married Couples Filing Jointly Stimulus Check Income Limits :
Married couples filing jointly are eligible for the stimulus check if their AGI was $ 150,000 or less .
The amount of the check phases out between $ 150,000 and $ 198,000 .
Those whose income exceeds the AGI limit will not receive a stimulus check .
Taxpayers will receive an additional $ 500 for each qualifying child ages 16 and under .
How the Income Phase - Out Works
Individual taxpayers who had an AGI between $ 75,000 and $ 99,000 and married couples with an AGI between $ 150,000 and $ 198,000 will receive a decreased stimulus check .
It works like this :
The stimulus check decreases by 5 % ( $ 5 for every $ 100 ) in $ 100 increments for each level above the threshold .
Here is a quick way to run the math .
Take your AGI and subtract the starting income for the phase - out ( $ 75,000 if a single taxpayer , or $ 150,000 for married couples ) .
Next , divide this number by 10 ( this gives you the number of $ 100 increments )
Multiply this number by $ 5 ( the reduction is $ 5 per every $ 100 above the threshold )
Subtract this number from the full stimulus check amount $ 1,200 or $ 2,400 ) .
Example :
You are a single taxpayer with an $ 80,000 AGI .
$ 80,000 – $ 75,000 = $ 5,000 .
$ 5,000 / $ 100 = 50
$ 50 * $ 5 = $ 250
$ 1,200 – $ 250 = $ 950
Will I Get a Stimulus Check if I Do n’t File a Tax Return ?
Maybe .
You should still be eligible for the stimulus check if you do n’t normally file a tax return because your income is too low or you only receive non-taxable income , such as SSDI , or VA disability benefits .
However , the checks may not be automatically sent .
Who does not need to file a tax return ?
The IRS does not require certain individuals to file a tax return if they do not have any income , their income is below a certain threshold , or they only have non-taxable income .
Income limits for filing a tax return :
Taxpayers do not need to file a tax return if their AGI was under $ 12,200 for single taxpayers or $ 24,400 for married couples .
: Taxpayers do not need to file a tax return if their AGI was under $ 12,200 for single taxpayers or $ 24,400 for married couples .
They also do not need to file a tax return if they only had non-taxable income .
Some Stimulus Checks Will be Automatically Sent to Those Who Did n’t File a Tax Return
You should automatically receive a stimulus check if you receive any of the following federal benefits :
Social Security Retirement , Social Security Disability ( SSDI ) , or Social Security Survivor Benefits
Railroad Retirement and Survivor Benefits
VA Service - Connected Disability Benefits ( this is an update , as of April 17 , 2020 ) .
However , it is important to note that you will need to file a tax return if you have any children ages 16 or under .
The IRS will not have this information in your file and will need it in order to process the additional $ 500 payment .
How Non-Tax Filers Can Get the Stimulus Check
Those who do n’t file a tax return can still get the stimulus check if they are not included among those who will automatically receive the stimulus check .
This may include disabled individuals whose primary source of income was a non-taxable benefit such as Supplemental Security Income ( SSI ) .
Those individuals will either need to file a tax return or use the IRS Non-Tax Filers Payment Info Form .
You can file for free using the IRS free file program or software from one of the leading tax software companies .
How to Use the IRS Non-Filers Payment Info Form
The IRS has set up a website to make it quick and easy to submit your information to receive your stimulus check .
Full name , current mailing address and an email address
Date of birth and valid Social Security number
Bank account number , type and routing number , if you have one
Identity Protection Personal Identification Number ( IP PIN ) you received from the IRS earlier this year , if you have one
Driver ’s license or state - issued ID , if you have one
For each qualifying child : name , Social Security number or Adoption Taxpayer Identification Number and their relationship to you or your spouse
When Will I Get My Stimulus Check ?
The IRS Hopes to start sending out stimulus checks during the week of April 12th .
However , it will most likely take several months before the IRS will be able to send stimulus checks to every eligible individual .
Previous economic stimulus checks sent out in 2008 and 2001 took several weeks to several months to begin sending checks , and an additional few months to complete the process .
Right now , we do n’t have a firm schedule .
We will update this article when the bill passes and we have further guidance regarding the 2020 Stimulus Check payment schedule .
The good news is that more people file their taxes electronically these days , and more taxpayers opt for direct deposit to receive their tax returns .
The IRS will send stimulus checks in the same manner taxpayers opted to receive their tax refund .
How Will I Receive My Stimulus Check – By Mail or Direct Deposit ?
The IRS will send out stimulus checks in the same method taxpayers elected to receive their refund on their most recent tax return .
If you opted to have your refund direct deposited into your checking or savings account , then the IRS will automatically deposit your check into your bank account .
If you opted to have your check mailed , then the IRS will send a check to the address they have on file .
Can I Update or Change My Payment Method ?
The IRS is working on building a “ Get Your Payment ” page in which taxpayers can
confirm payment method – direct deposit or check
enter or update their payment method ,
add or change their bank for direct deposit ,
update their address if they wish to receive a paper check , and
check the status of their stimulus check payment .
This page is expected to launch in Mid-April .
We will update this page when it is live .
You can also check this page for updates from the IRS .
Is the Stimulus Check Taxable ?
Will I Have to Pay it Back ?
No , the stimulus check is considered a refundable tax credit , which means it is not considered taxable income .
In essence , this is like a refund you get in advance of filing your 2020 tax return .
The IRS will compare your AGI from your 2020 tax return and the AGI used to determine your stimulus check amount ( from either your 2018 or 2019 tax return ) .
If the amount of your stimulus check was lower than you would have received based on your AGI from 2020 , then the IRS will give you the difference .
If you saw the example from above , we used a single taxpayer with an AGI of $ 80,000 .
They would receive a stimulus check of $ 950 because that income fell in within the phase - out limits .
If this same individual has an AGO of $ 75,000 or lower in 2020 , the IRS would give them the difference , in this case , they would receive an additional $ 250 .
If your income exceeds the AGI limits in 2020 , the IRS will not clawback the stimulus payments you received .
Will My Dependent Child Get a Stimulus Check if They Paid Taxes ?
You can only receive the $ 500 additional payment for children if they are ages 16 and under .
Children who are ages 17 and over are not eligible for the $ 500 payment on their parents ’ tax return .
Additionally , anyone who is claimed as a dependent is not eligible for the stimulus check .
So if your child is age 17 or over and you claim them on your tax return , they will not be eligible for their own stimulus check , even if they have a job and file their own tax return .
2020 Stimulus Check Frequently Asked Questions
How much is my stimulus check ?
If you qualify , your stimulus check will be $ 1,200 ( single taxpayers ) or $ 2,400 ( married couples filing jointly )

When will I receive my stimulus check ?

In an unprecedented experiment , a Japanese astronaut has thrown a boomerang in space and confirmed it flies back , much like on Earth .
Astronaut Takao Doi " threw a boomerang and saw it come back " during his free time on March 18 at the International Space Station ( ISS ) , a spokeswoman at the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency said .
Mr Doi threw the boomerang after a request from compatriot Yasuhiro Togai , a world boomerang champion .
" I was very surprised and moved to see that it flew the same way it does on Earth , " the Mainichi Shimbun daily quoted the 53 - year - old astronaut as telling his wife in a chat from space .
The space agency said a videotape of the experiment would likely be released later .
Doi travelled on US shuttle Endeavour on the March 11 blast - off and successfully delivered the first piece of a Japanese laboratory to the ISS .

News Director of Albuquerque 's KKOB Offers New Reason for Spiking Stories ; Anchorwoman Who Resigned in Protest Dismisses New Excuse , Says Powerful Station Buckled Under Pressure from Wilson 's Campaign
BRAD BLOG Obtains Scripts of Original Spiked Radio Reports ...
Brad Friedman Byon 3/6/2008 , 1:12 am PT
[ Story Summary : Via extensive BRAD BLOG interviews , New Mexico 's former Republican Governor repeats and adds fresh details to his allegations of Republican vote - buying by Congresswoman Heather Willson , tells us that the AG and SoS offices are now investigating the charges , and says he recently confronted Wilson , in person , about the allegations and was " stunned " by her response .
KKOB 's News Director Pat Allen offers a new reason as to why he spiked reporter Laura MacCallum 's stories on the scandal and she dismisses the argument as being without merit .
We also post the scripts of radio station KKOB 's yanked stories , which led to MacCallum 's resignation from the station last week . ]
32 - year award - winning news veteran and New Mexico's ABC field producer , Laura MacCallum , quit her job as afternoon anchor at Albuquerque 's 50,000 - watt blowtorch KKOB - AM 770 , after she read an email from her News Director , Pat Allen , which said , among other things , " if there was anything to it the bloggers would have picked this up , let alone other news agencies . "
Allen was referring to MacCallum 's on - air investigative reports covering allegations of a vote - buying scheme by New Mexico's U.S. Rep.
Heather Wilson at a recent Republican Delegate Convention .
The 1st Congressional District Congresswoman is vying for her party 's nomination to run for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated this year by outgoing Pete Domenici .
MacCallum ran the stories about the charges on KKOB several times , in several different variations --- including several different interviews and sound bites from both the former Republican Governor of New Mexico , David Cargo , an eye - witness to the story , and a current spokesman for the state GOP , Scott Darnell .
The stories ran , five different versions in all , over a two day period before they were spiked by station management allegedly after pressure from Wilson 's office .
The BRAD BLOG has obtained the scripts of those original spiked reports ( posted at the end of this article ) , though the complete audio is said to have been " dump[ed ] ... to make room for new stuff , " according to Allen tonight .
In the email to MacCallum , sent last week by the News Director after he'd received several phone calls from Wilson campaign spokesperson , Whitney Cheshire , he informed his afternoon drive news anchor that he'd " pulled " the stories from the station 's on - air news rotation .
After reading the email from Allen , MacCallum told us she became livid .
" I probably had flames coming out of my ears , " she explained this afternoon during a long phone call .
She immediately resigned in protest .
The BRAD BLOG has now spoken at length to Allen , MacCallum , and NM 's former Gov. Cargo , as well as several others involved with the story and / or looking into it for further details .
Suffice it to say , contrary to Allen 's memo , " the bloggers " have now picked this up , and , according to MacCallum and other sources , so have several of those " other news agencies " that Allen referenced in his email .
Moreover , Cargo tells us today that the charges of felony vote - buying are now under investigation by both the Secretary of State 's office as well as the state Attorney General .
Further , he told us of his confrontation with Wilson about the allegations some weeks ago .
Her response to the charges left the former Governor " stunned " ...
A New Reason Offered for Spiking the Stories
Allen confirmed that he had , in fact , heard several times from Wilson 's representative , Cheshire , as the stories were rolling on KKOB on Tuesday and Wednesday , February 26th & 27th .
Although she had complained about the stories , Allen says that Cheshire 's calls were n't the reason he 'd pulled them .
He told us that he removed the stories because MacCallum had n't obtained comment from Wilson or her campaign .
He had n't mentioned that particular reason in his memo , however .
Instead , he gave several other explanations for spiking the stories .
Nor did he mention that point to reporter Dennis Domrzalski , whose well - sourced scoop on MacCallum 's resignation offered a number of details of what allegedly occurred at the February 17th GOP Delegate Nominating Convention in Bernalillo County , NM , according to three different sources .
MacCallum was quick to note , when we told her of Allen 's response , that she had every intention to get comment from Wilson , and that her first series of stories had already included statements from an interview with state GOP spokesperson Scott Darnell .
That first series ran four times on the night of February 26th and during morning drive on the 27th .
Stories including interviews with Cargo ran in the afternoon on the 27th , when Allen then called MacCallum to ask her to contact Wilson 's camp for comment .
Before she could do so the next morning , her stories had already been pulled off the air by Allen for reasons detailed in his email on the morning of the 28th .
Though Allen 's memo to MacCallum never mentioned lack of comment from Wilson as the reason why he pulled the stories , he now says that was the reason .
" This comes down to one key point to me .
That is , if we 're going to run this kind of story , that are making these allegations , we have to at least call all the sides , " he said , " and she did n't do it . "
Allen claims , and MacCallum confirms , that they spoke by phone the night before he sent the memo .
She says she told him during that conversation that she'd be more than happy to contact Wilson for comment .
" I told him sure , I 'll do that .
I 'll call her tomorrow , I told him , " adding that the phone call with Allen came late Wednesday night at around 6:30 pm .
" I was already [ at the station ] late , it was past my shift , " she told us .
When she came to work the following morning , she found his email memo , notifying her that he'd pulled the stories which would have otherwise run during the morning drive news rotation .
" I read the email , I read it again , and I said ' I do n't believe this shit . '
I forwarded it to my husband and said I am outta here . "
She says she was livid .
" You do n't pull stories off the air because a politician gets pissed , " she told The BRAD BLOG .
Reporter Domrzalski , who broke the story on Monday , told us that when he'd spoken to Allen before running his article , the News Director had n't mentioned anything about the story being pulled because MacCallum --- the New Mexico Broadcasters Association 's " Newscaster of the Year " in 2006 and an Associated Press award winner for " Best Newscast " in the same year --- had n't yet contacted Wilson for comment .
Domrzalski said he'd spoken to Allen Monday morning , before running his story .
" He did n't mention anything about not having Wilson 's comments ... He talked about the story being uncorroborated , but did n't refer at all to not getting comment from Wilson 's side . "
Indeed the emailed memo from Allen to MacCallum , posted originally , in full , by Domrzalski in his story , details reasons other than contacting Wilson , to explain why the story was pulled :
Reply - To :
Date : Thu , 28 Feb 2008 09:22:27 - 0800 laura , i pulled the cargo stories .
i'm troubled by his motivation as he was not selected as a delegate .
unless there is an official investigation of criminal wrongdoing related to these meetings then the story is going nowhere .
it's also a very inside politics story that i do n't think has much importance to our listeners .
also , do n't you think if there was anything to it the bloggers would have picked this up , let alone other news agencies ?
this is the kind of story that has to be fully developed and verified before it can air .
pat allen news director 770 kkob radio , Albuquerque From : " Pat Allen "
When we asked Allen about the apparent contradictions in his story , and about his emailed assertion that he was pulling the stories because there had not yet been " an official investigation of criminal wrongdoing , " he explained , " Perhaps I did n't word my email as clearly as I should .
I wanted to make it clear that we needed all sides of the story . "
When asked why we , as reporters , should wait for an " official investigation " before working a story which might , in fact , actually help lead to such an investigation --- as the story now apparently has ---
Allen said , " Your point is well taken . "
MacCallum , however , believes the reason they pulled the stories was due to pressure from Wilson 's people , who had called at least twice to complain about the story .
She 's says this was n't the first such ethical conflict of interest she 'd noted at the station during her tenure , and added that she previously filed a complaint with the Poynter Institute , a professional journalism organization , over a prior transgression at the station .
" This is not the first time they breached an ethical issue at KKOB , " she said .
[ UPDATE : MacCallum explains the previous alleged ethical lapse by KKOB , in her full statement on this matter , now posted here at f- brilliant . ]
Allen strongly denied that there was any political agenda behind pulling the reports .
He says that he merely believed they needed corroboration , even though the charges came initially from former two - term Republican Governor David Cargo .
MacCallum herself had also been at the delegate convention in question and was able to corroborate much of Cargo 's allegations herself .
" I do n't want to run stories that are not based on fact , that are hearsay , " Allen told us .
" I do n't have an agenda either way .
If there 's something going on , we 'll report .
This is a great issue for bloggers and talk radio , but nobody corroborated this story to my satisfaction . "
Nonetheless , the stories ran on KKOB , five different versions , nine times in all , before Allen decided to pull them .
MacCallum kept hard copies of the scripts for the stories , posted at the end of this article .
The scripts do not , unfortunately , include the text of the actual sound bites from Cargo , and state GOP spokesperson Scott Darnell .
In the copy that she read , at least , there is no reference to Wilson .
We 've asked Allen for copies of audio versions of the full reports .
He says he believes they may have been erased already , but that he'd get back to us if he could find them .
When we checked again with him late this afternoon , via email , to see if he was able to locate them , he wrote , " i may still have the copy but i know we do n't have the audio of cargo ... we dump audio as to make room for new stuff .
the copy may still be in the file , i'll check tomorrow . "
Former Governor Confirms Vote - Buying Allegations Again
In reply to KKOB News Director Allen 's comments , that he was bothered by a lack of corroboration for the story , we pointed out that so far there were three sources making the claim , including MacCallum herself , since she was in attendance at the delegate convention where Gov. Cargo was unanimously elected as Ward Captain , before learning about the " crazy " situation that seemed to be unfolding before his eyes .
Allen says that , contrary to Domrzalski's report , Cargo had n't actually made the claims that had been reported .
But when we spoke directly to the former Governor by phone late this afternoon , he repeated the charges , almost precisely as reported by Domrzalski , and in no uncertain terms .
He also offered a great deal of additional detail .
As well , he tells us that he's now received calls from both the NM Secretary of State 's office , as well as the office of the Attorney General , and that both are currently investigating the vote - buying charges .
He reiterated to us what he had told Domrzalski : that he was told by a number of attendees at the convention that registration fees had been purchased for them , and that people were being " paid $ 35 an hour " to attend on behalf of candidates Wilson , and Bernalillo County Sheriff Darren White , who is vying for the Republican nomination to run for the Congressional seat that Rep.
Wilson is vacating to run for the U.S. Senate .
Cargo explained that when he noticed the unusually large number of attendees in his ward --- there were 59 people there this year , when normally they have from 9 to 15 or so , almost all of whom he knows --- he asked everyone to write their contact details on a piece of paper for the record .
" I noticed that 50 of you people have never been here before , " he announced .
" I said ' I 'm gonna pass around a tablet , to get your name and addresses , ' " but the people he had n't recognized demurred .
They did n't want to give their contact information .
" They said we 're gonna be here for two hours and that 's it .
' We 're just here for these two hours ' , " they told him .
Later , he says , " there were about six people standing in the hallway talking .
And I did n't know 'em .
And I know everybody usually .
They said ' What a convention ' , and I said , ' Yeah , what a mess ! ' and they [ complained by saying ] ' and we paid filing fees for these people . '
And I said ' you did ? , ' and they said ' Yeah , why ? '
And I said ' because that would be a fourth degree felony !
You can't pay for votes ! '
And then they scattered like a covey of quail . "
" I thought that was pretty unusual that there was people on staff that did n't realize you could n't pay people for this .
You can't pay for votes .
I would n't want them on my staff , " the two - term Governor , first elected in 1966 , added .
Later , he tells us , " Two kids , about twenty years old , said 'we were paid to come over here . ' "
" I thought Jesus .
This is really bizarre .
I thought maybe they were staff members , just monitoring the vote , but they were n't !
I thought this is the most peculiar thing I 've ever heard of in my life ! "
" When I spoke to other people , they were saying the same thing , " he claimed .
" They were saying that people were being paid $ 35 an hour and that they were paying their filing fees , as well . "
He went on to say that he was told the radio station heard from someone at the state GOP who questioned why Cargo would make such a charge .
" They talked to a guy who works for the Republican state central committee , and they said Dave Cargo thinks there was some irregularities at the convention , " and the official then said , according to Cargo , " How could he ?
We paid his way in ! "
Cargo not only denies that point , but adds that he actually paid twice to attend .
Once when he sent his filing fee several weeks before the convention , and then again at the door since he'd forgotten he 'd already paid .
When a party rep later called him to ask him what they should do with the second payment , he says he told them to " keep it as my donation . "
" One : If it were true that they paid my registration , I 'd be awfully chagrined to hear it .
And the second thing is , [ the state party rep who claimed they 'd paid his filing fee ] committed an illegal act !
He admits that they are paying for people to attend ! "
MacCallum said when we spoke to her before the Governor that she was contacted by an irate GOP party official after the initial stories , quoting state GOP spokesman Scott Darnell , had run .
" Tuesday evening after the stories ran , " she said , " I got a call from Adam Feldman , Director of the state GOP .
He called me and screamed at the top of his lungs at me for running the stories . "
" I said , why are you so upset ?
I said it 's not smart of you to call journalists and give them shit over the phone , " she told us .
" I asked if he heard the stories , and he said no , someone else heard them and told me about them . "
" I told him ' Do n't you ever call me again and complain about a story that is true . '
He got so pissed off at that point , the he just hung up on me .
He did n't say the story was not true , he just did n't want it run .
Period . "
" He was angry ... He was furious , " she says .
Blogger Says
It 's a " Non-Story " ; Former Governor Says State AG and SoS Now Investigating
New Mexico blogger Heath Haussamen is critical of both Domrzalski's reporting , and apparently ours .
He refers to us , without name , as he quotes the headline from our report on this last night .
But , he writes , he will not link to either us , or a NM Democratic Party press release , which also mentions our report , because he " wo n’t spread these rumors any further unless I find facts worth reporting . "
The dubious Haussamen suggests no laws were broken .
He claims to have spoken to unnamed " law - enforcement sources " who told him that " even if the allegations were true , they do n’t believe the law was violated .
The statute that prohibits vote buying applies to actual votes at the polls , the sources said , not votes on sending delegates to a state party convention . "
" The political parties ' delegate - selection processes are governed by their own rules , not state law , " Haussamen writes .
Cargo disagrees , and claims the Attorney General 's office seems to as well .
" The Secretary of State and the Attorney General called me , and they 're investigating this thing , " Cargo confirmed .
" If state law says it does n't pertain to political parties , what the hell does it pertain to ?
You ca n't buy votes ! , " he repeated again .
" The AG disagrees [ that it 's not illegal ] , " claimed Cargo , who added that he also believes it 's possible that " these people , when they were doing this stuff , did n't know it was illegal . "
Haussaman dismisses all of the reports as " rumors , " calling the affair a " non-story . "
He writes that those in the " liberal blogosphere " who have been covering it are " disgraceful " and " shameful . "
" As a journalist who is working hard to try to bring some integrity to the blogosphere , it makes me furious .
Whatever their motives , those who have spread this rumor as though it ’s fact should be ashamed , " he wrote late today .
Haussamen seemingly lumps us into the unspecified inhabitants of the " national liberal blogosphere , " even if a Clintonian parsing of his words reveal that he was careful to hedge his bets in regards to The BRAD BLOG specifically .
We were , after all , exceedingly critical of the recent New Mexico Democratic Party Caucus disaster on Super Tuesday and , in fact , had linked favorably to Haussamen 's coverage of same , in one of our reports on that particular mess .
He claims this evening that an unnamed representative of the Wilson camp has now denied the allegations of vote - buying .
Even if yet another Clintonian parsing of the denial , as Hassamen reported it , said to be from an anonymous spokesperson , leaves quite a bit of wiggle room as well .
" I spoke with the Wilson campaign , which flatly denied that it had paid anyone to attend the convention and vote for delegates who support the congresswoman , " he writes .
When we spoke to Domrzalski last night --- a 27 - year news reporter and host of two different local New Mexico television shows , according to his bio --- he made a specific point of letting us know , in no uncertain terms , that the Wilson spokesperson he spoke to before he ran his article , out - and - out " refused to deny the allegations " though he had pressed hard for such a denial .
We became aware of Haussamen 's blog item on this story , because it was sent to us , via email , by KKBO 's Allen this evening .
He had forwarded it to us , after it had been pasted into an email sent to him by Wilson spokesperson Whitney Cheshire .
A voice message and email sent to Cheshire , asking for comment on all of this , have not yet been returned .
[ UPDATE : Turns out Cheshire worked for Haussamen 's blog until late last year , yet he failed to make that disclosure in the article described above in which he rails about the lack of journalistic ethics of others .
Haussamen refused to add the disclosure , even now that we 've called him on it .
He has also refused to allow comments in reply over there from both Laura MacCallum and ourselves .

Cargo Confronted Wilson With Allegations Directly , Says She Didn't Deny , Just " Shrugged "
Governor Cargo says that he specifically confronted Rep. Heather Wilson about the vote - buying allegations at a Republican party function the Sunday after the convention , where she had asked him if he'd be willing to make some campaign appearances on her behalf .
When he raised the convention vote - buy charges with Wilson , he was stunned by her response .
Or lack thereof .
He explained , " I asked her directly , in public , with [ State ] Senator Joe Carraro right there , " about it .
Carraro is running against Bernalillo County Sheriff Darren
White --- whose campaign is alleged to have been a participant in the scheme --- for the Republican nomination to run for Wilson 's seat in the House of Representatives .
When the topic of the delegate convention came up , a fairly new process in the state , Wilson reportedly told him that she was pleased with the way it went .
Cargo was n't .
" I said it 's not a good idea because you 're driving party workers out of the party .
In my ward , you lost 7 of the 9 people who are very active .
You drove 'em all out .
That 's not very smart , " he says he told her .
" And not only that , worse than that , there are plenty of allegations that they bought votes and paid for registration fees , " he told her , in front of Carraro .
After that charge , Cargo says , " she never responded .
She just went on to change subject to something about Iraq . "
" Why she did n't [ respond ] I do n't know .
I like her , you know , I 've known her for a long time , but I was floored .
It was bizarre . "
" If someone had said that about me , that I was buying votes , I 'd have gone through the roof !
But she just looked at me and shrugged . "
Carraro , Cargo says , has now filed a complaint with the Sec. of State and Attorney General .
It was too late for us to confirm , or get comment from either of those offices tonight .
" It 's crazy !
The whole thing is crazy ! " the colorful former Governor continued .
" If someone asked me , ' Did you buy votes ? '
Man , I 'd come unglued !
I would n't say let 's talk about Iraq or something .
I 'd dispose of the thing right then and there . "
" if there was anything to it the bloggers would have picked this up "
" I can assure you that what I did was not based on what the Wilson campaign said or did , " KKOB 's News Director Pat Allen took pains to point out when we spoke with him earlier today .
He says allegations floated that the station was concerned about Wilson pulling advertising " was never part of the discussion , " with Wilson 's spokeswoman , Cheshire .
" It never came up . "
" We 're the largest station in the state , so everyone " advertises here , Allen said .
When asked if he would have allowed the stories to continue to run if MacCallum had gotten comment from Wilson , he paused before responding : " I would have been 99 % more likely to run the story . "
MacCallum , who is still freelancing as ABC News ' field producer in New Mexico , is now looking for work to replace her regular anchor job at KKOB .
She was highly critical of Allen 's lack of journalistic experience and standards , and disagrees that comment from Wilson --- which she was n't able to get before Allen pulled the story on his own --- would have made any difference to him .
" They would have canned anything that would have harmed Heather Wilson , " she said bluntly .
We emailed Allen tonight , after Cargo told us of the calls he'd received from the SoS and AG 's office .
" Now that the SoS and AG both are investigating , will KKOB be reporting that ?
Since it would seem to meet the standard you mentioned in your email to MacCallum ? , " we inquired .
Allen replied in his usual no -capitals style : " have you confirmed that both the sos and ag are looking into these allegations ?
if they are , i'll report it . "
We did n't get to ask him if he'd yet come to regret one of the comments he'd made to MacCallum , in his now - infamous email that led to her resignation , where he'd asked : " do n't you think if there was anything to it the bloggers would have picked this up , let alone other news agencies ? "
The BRAD BLOG can confirm that " bloggers , " recently resigned news anchors , as well as several " other news agencies " have , indeed , now picked up the story .
We 'll see where it all goes from here .
So far , Allen appears to have been wrong , at least , when he wrote to MacCallum that " the story is going nowhere . "

Lots of chatter about the way Bernalillio County Republican delegates were chosen at their convention a couple of weeks ago .
Former Governor Dave Cargo tells 770 KKOB many of them were paid by some of the candidates for their votes so other candidates did n't have a chance ...
GOP CARGO - 3 :13 ( outcue : " ...operate a convention . " )
Governor Cargo says many of the supposed delegates told him they were being paid and did n't intend to get involved in Republican party activities ... that they were only there to vote for whomever paid them to be there and would have no further involvement .

Move over Wikipedia ,
Yahoo Answers ,
Mahalo , and
Squidoo .
Maybe .
That ’s because Google ’s testing its own service to
let people build a repository of knowledge .
In fact , knowledge forms the core of
the service ’s name : Google Knol .
Screenshot of Google Knol page ( feel free to use this and
those below , just link to
this story , please )
Google Knol is designed to allow anyone to create a page on any topic , which
others can comment on , rate , and contribute to if the primary author allows .
The
service is in a private test beta .
You ca n’t apply to be part of it , nor can the
pubic see the pages that have been made .
Google also stressed to me that what ’s
shown in the screenshots it provided might change and that the service might not
launch at all .
NOTE : Knol has launched since this article was written .
See Google ’s Knol Launches : Like Wikipedia , With Moderation
As said , the service gets its name from the word " knowledge . " A " knol " is a
new term that Google has coined to stand for a unit of knowledge , and they ’re
also using that word as the name for pages within the service and the service
itself .
Knol pages will be hosted by Google .
Authors will have the option to enable
Google ads and share in revenue .
The pages will be made available to be found
through a Knol - specific search as well as through Google itself or via other
search engines , as they wo n’t be blocked from spiders .
It ’s likely the service
will be found at knol.google.com or some similar standalone address , if it
indeed finally launches .
As said , a launch might not happen at all — there ’s
certainly no set date .
Why do Knol ?
Google vice president of engineering , Udi Manber , who heads the
project , told me that is designed to help people put knowledge on the web that
does n’t currently exist , which in turn should make search better , since there
will be better information out there .
Of course , Google already offers other content creation tools , such as
Blogger and
Google Page Creator .
In addition , there
are non-Google tools people already use to publish content , not to mention
collaborative tools such as those I named at the opening of this article .
Why
yet another tool ?
Manber said that Knol has a special focus on authors and a collection of tools
that Google thinks is unique , and which in turn should encourage both content
creation and readership .
" Knol is all about the authors , " he said .
" We believe that knowing who wrote
a knol will significantly help users make better use of web content . "
Somehow , I suspect Seth Godin over at Squidoo is n’t going to be buying the
uniqueness argument .
At least on the face of the screenshots ( the one above is a
page authored by Manber ’s wife , who is testing the system ) , Squidoo offers
pages featuring authors prominently , which also allow ratings and some
collaboration .
Speaking of Squidoo leads to another issue .
Back in July , Squidoo found
spammers has caused the site itself to
take a hit in Google
rankings .
For Google to offer a similar service seems an invitation to disaster .
Wo n’t spammers overrun it , in the same way that many feel spammers have overrun
Google - owned Blogger ?
Does n’t that introduce yet more crud to ironically pollute
Google ’s own search results ?
Manber said he expect spammers will end up in the system but that Google has
already found ways to defeat them with Blogger and will take similar actions , if
needed , with Knol .
I ’d agree , Blogger spam showing up in Google has gotten much
better over the past few months .
However , I do n’t think I ’d say the problem is
defeated — and even if Google manages to wipe it out , it ’s still potentially
out there messing up other search engines .
This is not to say that all of Knol will be spam .
Indeed , it ’s likely that
the prominence of having content within a Google - hosted service may attract some
outstanding authors .
Manber certainly expect this , saying that he hopes content
is created that will be so good that Google itself will rank it tops in
searches .
That leads to another problem .
Is this Google going a step too far ?
Google
abandoned its search roots long ago , the idea that it was just a pointer to
other information .
Today , its
Search , Ads , & Apps
mantra that CEO Eric Schmidt has repeated on several occasions underscores that
offering content tools is fair game within its mission .
But does hosting content
turn it into a competitor with other content providers and set up an unfair
advantage in gaining traffic that might otherwise flow to them ?
Manber offered a number of reassurances that this is not the case :
The content will be owned by the authors , who can reprint it as they like
Authors can link out at will ( and links might NOT have nofollow attributes
on them , allowing reputation to flow from Knol pages to others )
on them , allowing reputation to flow from Knol pages to others ) APIs will allow Knol information to be used by others
Allowing ads other than Google ’s might be a possibility ( though this was
something I raised , rather than Google suggesting itself .
Personally , I highly
doubt this would ever happen )
something I raised , rather than Google suggesting itself .
Personally , I highly doubt this would ever happen )
Google will give no special weight to these pages ; if they rank , they rank
because they compete with other pages and win the algorithm race
Of course , Manber did say that Google could better tell which of the Knol
pages were of high quality by looking at signals such as ratings .
Because the
content database is hosted at Google , it could easily pull the rating info in
without having to " guess " or " scrape " it off pages .
My concern in hearing this was that other pages with ratings might not have
their information taking in as a quality signal , since Google could n’t as easily
harvest it .
Thus , Knol pages might get an unfair advantage .
To that , Manber
stressed that he did n’t see such signals being used at first , and if they were
down the line , Google might seek a way for others to provide similar signals to
its search engine .
Still , I have concerns about Knol in hurting independent authorship , just as
some of the other services I ’ve named do as well .
Go back two years ago , and
searches rarely came up with Wikipedia pages .
Today , it almost feels required
that Wikipedia gets one if not two listings on Google , due to its
indented results
feature .
The traffic that Wikipedia gets from Google has inspired others .
Yahoo
Answers pages show up in Google for topics ; Mahalo would love to rank for top
terms — and I ’ve already mentioned Squidoo ’s presence in search results .
Now
Google gets into the picture to have its own hosted content compete for the
dwindling diversity of results on the search results page .
It begins to feel
like the knowledge aggregators are going to push out anyone publishing knowledge
outside such aggregation systems .
I ’ll have much more to say about this as I continue on from my
Search 3.0 story and
into the next chapter , Search 4.0 , that ’s touched on in the earlier piece .
In
short , at some point search engines cross over a line where they ’re providing
more information than simple answers or pointing out , which changes them from
being a search service .
Mahalo’s had a fast evolution along these lines , with
some pages that are simply content destinations than search results .
What
happens when and if the major search engines do the same ?
Getting that balance
of human knowledge , compiled information , but still being a pointer is important .
If Knol launches , Google ’s going to face that challenge square on .
Of course , in some ways Google might not have a choice .
Yahoo has Yahoo
Answers ; Microsoft has its own answers service ; Wikipedia has experienced huge
growth , and things like Mahalo get some attention since they use humans , which
Google is seen to ignore .
A service like Knol might be necessary to stay
competitive .
Here ’s more of the screenshot from above :
Here ’s how the bottom of the Knol page looks :
INCREASES OVER A DECADE INCREASES OVER A DECADE
How much average water and sewer rates have increased nationally during the following two - year periods : Water rates Sewer rates 1996 - 98 12.3 % 3.5 % 1998-2000 6.5 % 10.1 % 2000 - 02 8.8 % 7.9 % 2002-04 7.2 % 12.1 % 2004-06 7.1 % 7.8 % Sources : Raftelis Financial Consultants
Huge increases in water and sewer bills are on the way in many places as cities and towns try to repair aging pipes and correct artificially low prices .
New York , Detroit , Tampa and Atlanta are among cities facing large rate increases .
Many of the nation 's 70,000 smaller systems — from Monterey , Calif. , to Charleston , W.Va . — are imposing major price hikes , too .
The Environmental Protection Agency estimates that the nation 's water and wastewater systems need an investment of up to $ 1.2 trillion over 20 years .
Also , arid states such as Arizona , Texas and Utah , where water costs more to provide , have fast - growing populations .
" God made the water , but he did n't make the pipes or have to comply with EPA regulations , " says Nick DeBenedictis , CEO of Aqua America , a private water company that serves 3 million .
Last year , the median residential bill was $ 278 for water and $ 276 for sewer service , reports the American Water Works Association , an industry group .
The median rate increase was about 5 % , says Doug Scott , a credit analyst at Fitch Ratings , which evaluates the debt of municipal utilities .
Average rate increases of that amount are enough to finance the industry 's capital needs , he says .
Many people , however , will see much larger increases because of the quirky pricing policy of water and sewer systems .
Already , some communities are getting scalded by price hikes of 50 % , 100 % or more .
The problem : Many municipal owned systems have treated rate hikes like tax increases and avoided them for years .
The Government Accountability Office estimates that 29 % of water systems and 41 % of sewer systems charge customers less than the cost of the service .
These money - losing systems have no way to finance expensive repairs without delivering a rate shock to customers .
" About the only time customers hear from water systems is when they want increases , and that makes people furious , " says Missouri Public Service Commission Chairman Jeff Davis .
The USA has about 54,000 community water systems and 16,000 sewer systems , according to the EPA .
Local government supplies 88 % of water and 80 % of sewer service .
City councils and county commissioners often vote on rates every year .
" You can get all the water you need for a buck a day , " DeBenedictis says .
" But many cities are charging 25 cents .
When they go to 50 cents , the headline is : ' Mayor asks for 100 % rate increase . ' "
A sampling of big increases : • Muskegon Heights , Mich. , increased its rates 100 % for next year , angering neighboring communities that depend on it for water .
It was the first change in seven years .
• In Anthem , Ariz. , Arizona - American Water Co. asked for a 71 % hike in rates for homeowners and 120 % for businesses , plus future rate increases .
It scaled back the request by an unspecified amount .
The company says it needs to repay the developer of the planned community of 40,000 near Phoenix for building the system .
• Bay County , Fla. , home of Panama City , hiked its rates 61 % , the first change since 2000 .
Rate hikes often are viewed as unfair , especially in communities that buy water and sewer services from private companies or other towns .
Connecticut state Rep. John Hetherington objected when New Canaan got hit with a 33 % increase , more than other towns .
" Tax increases .
Higher electric rates .
Now this , " he says .
" It 's one more thing people living on the edge have to deal with . "
The burden is falling hardest on older cities that have systems built after World War II .
Atlanta is investing $ 3.9 billion in its system .
Atlanta voters approved a 1 - cent sales tax to limit this year 's rate hike to 10 % .
Otherwise , it would have jumped 43 % .

Anti-war groups launch campaigns against ' bomb Iran ' McCain David Edwards and Nick Juliano
Published : Friday February 29 , 2008
|
Print This Email This Democrats and anti-war activists have made John McCain 's hawkish views on Iraq and Iran one of the most prominent arguments against his presidential candidacy .
VoteVets.org has launched a new ad against the Republican candidate featuring a female Iraq vet and her baby , suggesting that McCain will spend on endless war instead of on the things Americans really need .
Meanwhile , anti-war group True Majority is planning a campaign targeting McCain 's musings about bombing Iran .
The group will unveil its IranMobile at a rally in Ohio this weekend .
Brave New Films has released a new video parodying McCain 's botched attempt at a joke during a campaign appearance last year .
The GOP candidate changed lyrics of a famous Beach Boy 's song to " Bomb Iran . "
" What is troubling is that John McCain 's attitude toward this conflict is eerily similar to talk that began before the war in Iraq .
Weapons of Mass Destruction seem to be replaced with nuclear threats that have been unsubstantiated , " Brian Rothenberg , of ProgressOhio.org which is co-sponsoring the effort , said in a news release .
" The invasion of Iraq opened the floodgates for Al Qaeda and what Sen. McCain says will be 100 - years of American soldiers in a foreign land . "
The Associated Press criticized Democrats for taking McCain's " 100 years " comment out of context .
Jon Soltz , a co-founder of VoteVets , and conservative writer Ericka Anderson of HumanEvents.com appeared on MSNBC to debate the claims in the ad .
" We all respect John McCain 's service in Vietnam , " Soltz began .
" But he 's not in touch with what Americans want .
...
We have a right to ask him for some straight talk .
...
He can't do everything he says .
Cut taxes for the richest people in America .
Keep us in Iraq in an endless war . "
Anderson retorted that the ad campaign " goes back to the guns vs. butter argument , and it 's just an illogical argument , because Iraq is n't a war we can walk away from and expect it not to follow us home . "
" Osama bin Laden is in Afghanistan , " Soltz said in response .
" There was no al Qaeda in Iraq when we invaded .
... John McCain wants to keep 90 % of our army in a civil war . "
" The people in our organization have been to Iraq , " Soltz continued .
" We 've seen it first hand .
We do n't need Republican talking points . "
" You are n't the only people that have been in Iraq ! " Anderson shot back .
" For some reason , the Republican Party and the conservatives in this country lost their way , " Soltz replied .
" It 's like you do n't care about the people that attacked our country ! "
Anderson insisted that McCain " wants the troops to come home just as much as you do , but he wants them to come home with honor .
...
They 're not going to come home with honor if they cut and run .
...
We have a job to do in Iraq . "

Is the United States moving toward military action with Iran ?
The resignation of the top U.S. military commander for the Middle East is setting off alarms that the Bush administration is intent on using military force to stop Iran 's moves toward gaining nuclear weapons .
In announcing his sudden resignation today following a report on his views in Esquire , Adm .
William Fallon did n't directly deny that he differs with President Bush over at least some aspects of the president 's policy on Iran .
For his part , Defense Secretary Robert Gates said it is " ridiculous " to think that the departure of Fallon — whose Central Command has been working on contingency plans for strikes on Iran as well as overseeing Iraq — signals that the United States is planning to go to war with Iran .
Related News
Fallon 's resignation , ending a 41 - year Navy career , has reignited the buzz of speculation over what the Bush administration intends to do given that its troubled , sluggish diplomatic effort has failed to slow Iran 's nuclear advances .
Those activities include the advancing process of uranium enrichment , a key step to producing the material necessary to fuel a bomb , though the Iranians assert the work is to produce nuclear fuel for civilian power reactors , not weapons .
Here are six developments that may have Iran as a common thread .
And , if it comes to war , they may be seen as clues as to what was planned .
None of them is conclusive , and each has a credible non-Iran related explanation :
1. Fallon 's resignation : With the Army fully engaged in Iraq , much of the contingency planning for possible military action has fallen to the Navy , which has looked at the use of carrier - based warplanes and sea-launched missiles as the weapons to destroy Iran 's air defenses and nuclear infrastructure .
Centcom commands the U.S. naval forces in and near the Persian Gulf .
In the aftermath of the problems with the Iraq war , there has been much discussion within the military that senior military officers should have resigned at the time when they disagreed with the White House .
2. Vice President Cheney 's peace trip : Cheney , who is seen as a leading hawk on Iran , is going on what is described as a Mideast trip to try to give a boost to stalled Israeli - Palestinian peace talks .
But he has also scheduled two other stops :
One , Oman , is a key military ally and logistics hub for military operations in the Persian Gulf .
It also faces Iran across the narrow , vital Strait of Hormuz , the vulnerable oil transit chokepoint into and out of the Persian Gulf that Iran has threatened to blockade in the event of war .
Cheney is also going to Saudi Arabia , whose support would be sought before any military action given its ability to increase oil supplies if Iran 's oil is cut off .
Back in March 2002 , Cheney made a high - profile Mideast trip to Saudi Arabia and other nations that officials said at the time was about diplomacy toward Iraq and not war , which began a year later .
3. Israeli airstrike on Syria : Israel 's airstrike deep in Syria last October was reported to have targeted a nuclear - related facility , but details have remained sketchy and some experts have been skeptical that Syria had a covert nuclear program .
An alternative scenario floating in Israel and Lebanon is that the real purpose of the strike was to force Syria to switch on the targeting electronics for newly received Russian anti-aircraft defenses .
The location of the strike is seen as on a likely flight path to Iran ( also crossing the friendly Kurdish - controlled Northern Iraq ) , and knowing the electronic signatures of the defensive systems is necessary to reduce the risks for warplanes heading to targets in Iran .
4. Warships off Lebanon : Two U.S. warships took up positions off Lebanon earlier this month , replacing the USS Cole .
The deployment was said to signal U.S. concern over the political stalemate in Lebanon and the influence of Syria in that country .
But the United States also would want its warships in the eastern Mediterranean in the event of military action against Iran to keep Iranian ally Syria in check and to help provide air cover to Israel against Iranian missile reprisals .
One of the newly deployed ships , the USS Ross , is an Aegis guided missile destroyer , a top system for defense against air attacks .
5. Israeli comments : Israeli President Shimon Peres said earlier this month that Israel will not consider unilateral action to stop Iran from getting a nuclear bomb .
In the past , though , Israeli officials have quite consistently said they were prepared to act alone -- if that becomes necessary -- to ensure that Iran does not cross a nuclear weapons threshold .
Was Peres speaking for himself , or has President Bush given the Israelis an assurance that they wo n't have to act alone ?
6.Israel 's war with Hezbollah : While this seems a bit old , Israel 's July 2006 war in Lebanon against Iranian - backed Hezbollah forces was seen at the time as a step that Israel would want to take if it anticipated a clash with Iran .
The radical Shiite group is seen not only as a threat on it own but also as a possible Iranian surrogate force in the event of war with Iran .
So it was important for Israel to push Hezbollah forces back from their positions on Lebanon 's border with Israel and to do enough damage to Hezbollah 's Iranian - supplied arsenals to reduce its capabilities .
Since then , Hezbollah has been able to rearm , though a United Nations force polices a border area buffer zone in southern Lebanon .
Defense Secretary Gates said that Fallon , 63 , asked for permission to retire .
Gates said that the decision , effective March 31 , was entirely Fallon 's and that Gates believed it was " the right thing to do . "
In Esquire , an article on Fallon portrayed him as opposed to President Bush 's Iran policy and said he was a lone voice against taking military action to stop the Iranian nuclear program .
In his statement , Fallon said he agreed with the president 's " policy objectives " but was silent on whether he opposed aspects of the president 's plans .
" Recent press reports suggesting a disconnect between my views and the president 's policy objectives have become a distraction at a critical time and hamper efforts in the Centcom region , " Fallon , said in the statement issued by Centcom headquarters in Tampa , Fla .
" And although I do n't believe there have ever been any differences about the objectives of our policy in the Central Command area of responsibility , the simple perception that there is makes it difficult for me to effectively serve America 's interests there , " he said .
Gates announced that Fallon 's top deputy , Army Lt. Gen. Martin Dempsey , will take over temporarily when Fallon leaves .
A permanent successor , requiring nomination by the president and confirmation by the Senate , might not be designated in the near term .
The Journalism 1A dictum is
If your mother tells you she loves , check it out .
This inviolable rule applies in all things save Mike Huckabee ’s 110 lb. weight loss , a matter for which Journalism has granted Huckabee a dispensation .
Huckabee says he lost his weight through diet / exercise , and that is what is reported , without any troubling questions .
This credulousness might have been excusable several months ago when Huckabee was an obscure footnote to the GOP campaign , and little was known of the details of his weight loss .
In the last month , however , Huckabee has been leading the GOP polls , and this blog ’s article demonstrating the likelihood of gastric bypass richocheted around the right blogosphere , being picked up by scores of blogs .
Reporters can claim neither ignorance nor unimportance .
Like low hanging fruit , the story of Huckabee ’s possible gastric bypass is within easy reach , an readily understood story of GOP frontrunner deceit .
Yet the MSM still completely ignores it :
No reporter has ever asked Huckabee directly whether his weight loss is attributable to weight loss surgery .
No MSM story has mentioned the blogosphere speculation of gastric bypass .
Hundreds of MSM stories mention Huckabee ’s weight loss , all of which give either tacit or specific attribution to diet / exercise .
The MSM ’s supine disinterest in this matter is readily explained .
Huckabee is the media ’s GOP darling .
The DNC has decided he is Easy Kill , for whom they will withhold fire until nominated , and accordingly so too is Huckabee the MSM ’s preferred GOP candidate .
If this were any other GOP candidate , the MSM would pursue the story with zeal proportionate to the number of DNC press releases attacks ( Romney 99 , Giuliani 74 , McCain 64 , Thompson 20 , Huckabee 4 ) .
Should Huckabee gain the nomination ( or be placed on the ticket ) the MSM would presumably unleash this story along with anything else they could throw at him .
This left - wing opposition research piece on Huckabee makes clear that the Democrats / MSM are aware of this issue ’s negative potential , which they hold in reserve .
Is the story too personal for a media grown suddenly fastidious ?
No problem , as Hucakbee has helpfully provided a graft angle , as he has parlayed his weight loss into not only fame but fortune as well .
Politico reports that , unusual for a Governor and Presidential candidate , Hucakbee made substantial outside income .
Since 2004
Huckabee earned $ 405,000 through honoraria , books sales , consulting and outside income .
Much if not most of this relates directly to Huckabee ’s weight saga :
It ’s not hard to see why his story appeals to groups and companies in the public health arena .
An ordained Baptist minister who dropped more than 100 pounds after being diagnosed with Type II diabetes , Huckabee pushed to expand health care access and incentivize healthy living in Arkansas .
Thus whether reporters should follow the money trail or check out his story , they will end up at the same place– the veracity of Huckabee ’s weight loss .
That the MSM is aware of this story is evidenced by the observation of Huckabee nemesis Max Brantley of the Arkansas Times that interested national reporters have discussed the gastric bypass matter with him , but done nothing .
Brantley can’t abide even the risk of Huckabee being the nominee , and lately has resorted to pleading for the MSM to look into it :
But if [ Huckabee is ] making money talking about health care ( including to stem cell researcher Novo Nordisk ) , is n’t it time to put a definitive rest to the questions about whether his weight loss was strictly a result of dieting and exercise , as he claims , or as Arkansas legend has long had it , assisted by surgery ?
Given the trivial nature of matters upon which the MSM do eagerly pursue ( e.g. undocumented landscapers ) , the MSM can hardly deem this issue titillating but unimportant .
The sudden weight loss provided Huckabee what charisma he has , the publicity that brought him from obscurity , his ‘ signature issue ‘ , the rationale for his candidacy ’s obligatory health plan , what would be ill - gotten royalty income from a scam diet book , as well as considerable consulting and speechifying fees .
If he has mischaracterized his weight loss , he has defrauded his publisher , consulting clients , and audiences ; based Arkansas health policy on a false premise ; lied to hundreds of reporters ; falsified his Presidential resume , and hidden a relevant health matter from voters .
This all would have been a pre-meditated scam , and his subsequent career that of a risible Elmer Pantry .
If the MSM has steered clear , it is only because of its importance .
Nor can the MSM claim that investigation of a candidate ’s medical record is somehow journalistically proscribed .
George Stephanopoulos on Sunday felt free to grill Giuliani about his recent medical condition , including demands to see medical records , and no one called Stephanopoulos out of bounds .
Likewise , the MSM was unstinting in evaluating Fred Thompson non-Hodgkins lymphoma .
A gastric bypass , which is associated with increased hospitalization and mortality , is of similar medical magnitude to Giuliani ’s prostate cancer and Thompson ’s NHL .
Huckabee has absolutely no right to hide this significant condition from voters , and the MSM , which are supposed to be vetting candidates , have no grounds for enabling Huckabee ’s deception .
An investigation by the MSM would require no sleuthing or researching .
All a reporter would need do is summon the temerity to directly ask Huckabee whether or not he had weight loss surgery , as getting him definitively on record would in itself be news .
If Huckabee is asked , and denies , the reporter would then ask for the radiologist report and barium swallow CT scan he likely had to diagnose his hernia in 2005 .
If his weight loss was through diet / exercise , the CT scan will show a normal stomach ( and a rare type of hernia ) .
If he refuses to provide such innocuous medical records , the conclusion is obvious , and could be the subject of a news story .
The MSM ’s abdication of their duty to check out Huckabee ’s implausible weight loss claim reveals much about both Hucakbee and the MSM .
The former , how advantageous a candidate he would be for the Democrats , the latter how diabolically partisan is their coverage .

From the Arizona Republic :
Three day laborers filed a lawsuit Tuesday that seeks to overturn a
suburb 's law prohibiting people standing on public streets from
soliciting employment from occupants of cars .
The federal lawsuit alleges Cave Creek 's law passed is unconstitutional
because it restricts the free speech rights of people trying to find
work as day laborers .
" Cave Creek does not have the right to pick and choose who has free
speech rights , " said Monica Ramirez , an attorney for the American Civil
Liberties Union , one of the group 's representing the day laborers .
" The
town cannot bar people from peaceably standing in public areas and
expressing their availability to work . "
The stated reason for the law is this , but do n't believe it :
Mayor Vincent Francia said the law was a response to concerns raised by
residents over traffic being impeded by people congregating on street
corners .
If you followed the genesis of this law , it has less than zero to do with traffic .
It was crafted as a way to prevent people of Mexican birth , with or without the proper papers from the US government , from seeking work in Cave Creek .
Which explains why sheriff Joe Arpaio is so eager to help enforce the law , and why , by some statistical fluke , everyone arrested under the law seems to be of Mexican Latin descent ( the three laborers filing the suit are Mexican and Guatemalan and are in this country legally ) .
I am happy to see this suit get filed under whatever auspices that it can , and have in the past supported using the first amendment to protect free commerce .
Further , I am thrilled to see the ACLU , given its Stalinist origins , for once actively support the right to publicly advertise and conduct commerce .
However , it is sad to me that Thomas Jefferson and company did not think it necesary to enshrine the right to free commerce as an protected right up there with speech and association .
One might argue that the enumerated power concept and the 9th amendment should be protection enough , but obviously Jefferson did not think so or he would not have pushed for the Bill of Rights .
And saying the following may just prove that I am not a Constitutional expert , but it strikes me that another problem with the original Constitution that probably was n't fixable at the time was the fact that the Bill of Rights did not originally restrain the states , only the Federal government .
Only with the beat - down of states rights concepts in the Civil War and the passage and later interpretation of the 14th amendment did the Supreme Court begin to apply the Bill of Rights to states and municipalities as well .
It is good that they have done so , but these protections enforced on states only tend to be the enumerated protections of the Bill of Rights .
In fact , in this context , the 9th is meaningless because it reserves unenumerated powers to the people or the states , so it contributes nothing to reigning in municipalities , only the Feds .
All that being said , it should would have been nice to have three extra words such as " or conduct commerce " inserted after assembly :
Mick Jagger , Rupert Murdoch and Michael Douglas all have the right idea , evolutionarily speaking .
Statistics show that monogamous men have the most children if they marry women younger than themselves .
How much younger is the key question .
Last year , a study of Swedish census information suggested a 4 to 6 - year age gap is best , but new research has found that in some circumstances a surprisingly large gap – 15 years – is the optimum .
Martin Fieder at the University of Vienna and Susanne Huber of the University of Veterinary Medicine , also in Vienna , Austria , studied the Swedish data and found that a simple equation related the age difference of the parents to the number of offspring .
For people who had maintained monogamous relationships throughout adulthood , the most children were found in couples where the man was 4.0 to 5.9 years older than the woman .
The probable reasons behind this state of affairs are not controversial : “ Men want women younger than themselves because they are physically attractive , ” says Fieder , while women tend to prioritise a partner who can provide security and stability , and so tend to opt for older men .

Mum ’s the word
However , Fieder and Huber ’s calculations drew criticism .
For example , Erik Lindqvist at the Research Institute of Industrial Economics in Stockholm , Sweden , pointed out that the age of the mother is likely to be more important than any age difference : the older the mother , the lower her chances of having more children .
“ We added that factor into the calculation , ” says statistician Fred Bookstein at the University of Washington , a colleague of Fieder and Huber .
“ The importance of the age difference did n’t change . ”
Even if it holds true for Sweden , the 4 to 6 - year age gap is unlikely to be optimal in all cultures .
Samuli Helle at the University of Turku in Finland read Fieder and Huber ’s paper and says it stirred memories of an unpublished study he conducted a few years ago .
Cultural differences
“ In 2001 , I studied the demographics of the Sami people of northern Finland , ” he says .
“ I had thought I had missed the opportunity to publish , but when I saw the Fieder and Huber paper I thought : why not write a response ? ”
Helle ’s team performed a similar calculation to Fieder and Huber ’s , using the demographic data from the 17th to 19th centuries that Helle had already collected from northern Finland .
For the Sami people , they found that males with 15 years on their partners had the most children .
“ I do n’t know why the optimal age differences were so much bigger among the Sami people , but it might be related to culture , ” says Helle , noting that the Sami were nomadic reindeer hunters .
“ Perhaps those huge lifestyle differences are important . ”

The U.S. is building on Saddam 's databases to assemble biometric files and national ID cards for hundreds of thousands of Iraqis .
American military officials say it's a crucial step towards getting a handle on who the bad guys are in Iraq .
But groups like the Electronic Privacy Information Center ( EPIC ) spooked – in a sectarian civil war , they argue , a biometric identification can suddenly become a death warrant .
Today , in a blogger 's conference call , Lieutenant Colonel
John Velliquette , the biometrics manager in Iraq for the " Coalition Police Assistance Training Team , " said he was worried , too .
" This database ... becomes is a hit list if it gets in the wrong hands , " Lt. Col.
Velliquette tells DANGER ROOM .
EPIC wrote to Defense Secretary Robert Gates earlier this summer that :
We recognize the strategic military importance of identifying threats to American
military personnel .
However ... the biometric identification of Sunni , Shiite , and Kurd populations vastly increases the possibility that this information may be misused at some future point .
Because names are associated with religious identity , many Iraqis change their names or
carry fake IDs to avoid being murdered by rival sects .
Numerous reports indicate that Iraqis
regularly risk death if they are proven to be of a different sect than gunmen at a checkpoint .
In July 2006 , Shiite militiamen established a fake checkpoint and killed up to 50 Sunnis after examining their identification documents ...
In Rwanda ... official identification cards contained ethnic information .
The classification system was a remnant from the Belgian colonial government , and was extensively used to identify victims to be killed .
To have the word “ Tutsi ” on an identification card was a death sentence .
So I asked Lt. Col. Velliquette about these concerns .
Q Hey , Colonel , thanks for doing this .
It 's Noah Shachtman with Wired magazine .
A couple questions , or couple - part questions .
Besides the picture and the iris and the fingerprints , what other information is tied to this biometric ?
That 's part one . *
LT .
COL .
VELLIQUETTE : Well , when you take the person 's biometrics , you have them bring in their jensea ( ph ) card , which is the
Iraqi national identification card .
It 's not really an advanced card , but it 's the information from which they start .
Essentially what we 're doing is we 're assigning fingerprints of this person 's identity , his name on the jensea ( ph ) card .
So all that information off the jensea card ( ph ) – his name , all the travel names , father 's name , mother 's name – is all entered into the database .
And the database is , I must add , is both in English and Arabic .
And it takes his address , other personal biographical information , his height , weight , hair color – *
Q Date of birth , religion , that kind of stuff ?
* LT . COL .
VELLIQUETTE : Exactly .
Well , no , I 'm not so sure about the religion part .
Q
But certainly the tribal – I mean the tribal information maps to the religion , right ?
LT .
COL .
VELLIQUETTE : It could .
It could .
You know , the MOI is taking great pains not to make a big deal as far as what religion they are , whether it 's Sunni or Shi'ite .
They 're very conscious about that .
So to my knowledge , they do n't – that information 's not put on a database .
This database , I must add , is also very sensitive , because essentially what it becomes is a hit list if it gets in the wrong hands .
You know , some sectors are entirely Sunni , some are entirely
Shi'ite , so we make take great pains to make sure this database stays in the proper hands .
I also asked Lt. Col. Velliquette about Bing West 's allegations , that " a few enterprising American rifle companies have conducted their own independent censuses , employing rudimentary spreadsheets and personal digital cameras .
But no central information system exists . "
Not exactly , Lt. Col. Velliquette countered .
** Q ... [ M ]y understanding was that in addition to the efforts that you 're performing , also a number of local commanders are ... ollecting biometrics in their own AOs .
Is there any attempt to bring that sort of piecemeal biometric together ?
And , you know , does the commander in the field have access to your ... central database ?
* LT .
COL .
VELLIQUETTE : Yes .
The three – the other two systems that you 're talking about in country are the Biometric Automated Tool Set [ BAT ] , which is a coalition force protection system .
It has a secret component , on the high side , and also there 's the Biometric Identification System for Access , which is used for base access .
* * For instance , to get into the International Zone , you would have to go through that system .
*
All three systems are actually tied together through the Biometrics Fusion Center in West Virginia .
And the BAT system is used out in the field by local commanders for force protection issues mainly .
A local commander out in the field will not have access to the Iraqi database generally , just because there are no current systems set up in place to do that ... * Q [ So ] if I have a BAT system in Fallujah and I have somebody entered into my system and that person moves to Baghdad , you know , there 's no way to track that person from Fallujah to Baghdad .
Or there 's no – the system in Baghdad wo n't also have that information .
* * LT . COL .
VELLIQUETTE : Are you talking about Iraqi AFIS ? * *Q [ So if ] a commander in the field takes a fingerprint of a insurgent suspect in Fallujah .
Let 's say that guy shows up again in Baghdad .
Will there be any biometric information about that person ?
* * LT . COL .
VELLIQUETTE : Well , if he collected biometric information from that person in Fallujah , then it's in the system at the Biometrics Fusion Center in West Virginia .
So if he 's detained for whatever reason in Baghdad , and hopefully if he 's a insurgent suspect , hopefully he 's not still loose .
* *Q Right .
* LT . COL .
VELLIQUETTE : But if he 's contacted again in Baghdad then yes , it is possible to find out if he's in the system .
ALSO :
* Two - Thirds of Iraq Suspects Let Go ; Only 600 Sent to Gov't
* Baqubah's Biometric Squeeze

Anyone that thinks their religion trumps my person rights
I do n't think the pictures should be removed .
I do n't care if it is offensive .
Personal rights trump religion all the time .
By trying to dissuade others from sharing information in a peaceful manner you are just making yourselves look bad .
you cant control internet , so just deal with it .
I can say without even checking that there are more than just these images online .
Good luck trying to get them all taken down .
I do n't prescribe to your beliefs and I and not subject to your rules .

Caught in Action : Avalanches on North Polar Scarps
PSP_007338_2640 Science
Theme :

WALLPAPER
Amazingly , this HiRISE image has captured .
The image to the left shows the context of where these avalanches occurred , with white boxes indicating the locations of the more detailed image portions shown to the right ( all images are false color ) .
Material , likely including fine - grained ice and dust and possibly including large blocks , has detached from a towering cliff and cascaded to the gentler slopes below .
The occurrence of the avalanches is spectacularly revealed by the accompanying clouds of fine material that continue to settle out of the air .
The largest cloud ( upper images ) traces the path of the debris as it fell down the slope , hit the lower slope , and continues downhill , forming a billowing cloud front .
This cloud is about 180 meters across and extends about 190 meters from the base of the steep cliff .
Shadows to the lower left of each cloud illustrate further that these are three dimensional features hanging in the air in front of the cliff face , and not markings on the ground ( sun is from the upper right ) .
Cameras orbiting
Mars have taken thousands of images that have enabled scientists to put together pieces of Marsâ geologic history .
However , most of them reveal landscapes that havenât changed much in millions of years .
Some images taken at different times of year do show seasonal changes from one image to the next ; however , it is extremely rare to catch such a dramatic event in action .
( Another , unrelated , active process that has been captured by Mars cameras are dust devils . )
Observing currently active processes is often a useful tool in unlocking puzzles of the past for scientists studying the Earth .
Working from primarily still images , it is harder for scientists studying Mars to rely on this tool .
The HiRISE image of avalanching debris is a very rare opportunity to directly do so .
The scarp in this image is on the edge of the dome of layered deposits centered on Mars ’ North Pole .
From top to bottom this impressive cliff is over 700 meters tall and reaches slopes over 60 degrees .
The top part of the scarp , to the left of the images , is still covered with bright ( white ) carbon dioxide frost which is disappearing from the polar regions as spring progresses .
The upper mid-toned ( pinkish - brownish ) section is composed of layers ( difficult to see here ) that are mostly ice with varying amounts of dust .
The darkest deposits below form more gentle slopes , less than 20 degrees , and are mainly composed of two materials : mid-toned layers , possibly ice - rich , that form small shelves , and more mobile , widespread , sand - sized dark material .
The wavy forms on the flatter areas to the right are dunes .
The upper , steepest section , which appears highly fractured due to blocks pulling away from the wall , is the likely source zone for the falls .
The precise trigger mechanism is not yet known , although the disappearance of the carbon dioxide frost , the expansion and contraction of the ice in response to temperature differences , a nearby Mars - quake or meteorite impact , and vibrations caused by the first fall in the area , are all possible contributors .
By comparing images taken and after the fall , we may be able to see where material has disappeared from the steep scarp and where it has appeared on the gentler slopes below , possibly as larger blocks , diffuse streaks , or other debris deposits .
By imaging this scarp throughout the polar summer , we may be able to determine how much material falls over a given time period .
These observations will help determine how much , and at what rate , ice is being eroded from the cliff .
Understanding the processes and rates of erosion also help determine how the polar landscape has evolved , and help reveal how volatiles , such as water and carbon dioxide ices and gases , move around Mars .
The precise composition of the ice - dust mixture making up layers in the upper , steepest section of scarp is unknown .
However , detailed measurements of the volume of material removed , the configuration of the source area , and the steepness of the slope can be used to estimate physical properties of the material that may relate to composition .
Written by : Patrick Rusell ( 3 March 2008 )
Just past suppertime on a starry night in November , several unfamiliar cars pulled up outside 251 Waterford Crystal Drive , in Dardenne Prairie , Missouri , where news vans had been parked for weeks to cover a tragedy that came to be known , in the bluff shorthand of the morning shows , as the MySpace Suicide Hoax .
A well - combed man in a blue suit , a correspondent for “ Good Morning America , ” stood on the front lawn yelling into his BlackBerry .
Two ornamental angels loomed from an upstairs window of the house , a two - story Colonial with white siding .
Inside , much of the furniture had been removed from the living room , making way for a large picture , propped on an easel , of Megan Meier .
A year earlier , Megan had committed suicide after an exchange of hostile messages with a boy who had befriended her on MySpace .
She was thirteen , a volleyball player and a Chihuahua maniac .
“ M is for Modern , E is for Enthusiastic , G is for Goofy , A is for Alluring , N is for Neglected , ” she had written in an acrostic poem that accompanied her MySpace profile .
The “ MySpace Suicide Hoax ” tagline that appeared on the broadcasts and in the chat rooms was , however , a misnomer .
Megan ’s suicide — for anyone who had not already heard , or been forwarded , the story ( often with a stunned “ OMG ” ) — had not been a hoax ; rather , it was precipitated by a hoax , involving a boy named Josh Evans .
Josh Evans was a fake , a cyber - character created by neighbors of the Meiers .
In the picture , Megan was wearing a rhinestone tiara .
Her eyes were rimmed with black eyeliner , her brows plucked into the shape of birds ’ wings , her brown hair prettily lifted off her face in layers .
She stared directly at the camera , screwing her lips into the half - sulky , half - silly , exactingly lip - glossed pout that — whether designed to suggest vampiness or simply to mask the indignities of orthodontia — is a ubiquitous affectation of American teen - age girldom .
Megan — Megan Babi was her Internet handle — had used a similar photograph to illustrate her MySpace profile .
It was just a casual snapshot , but something about it seemed to embody both the sadness and the exhilaration of female adolescence .
Megan loved Pink , a loungewear line by Victoria ’s Secret , which is popular for the inclusion of a free toy “ mini- dog ” with many purchases .
Like Pink , the photograph represented a tender contradiction : the girl who wants both a stuffed animal and a Miracle Bra .
“ Oh , god .
Poor baby .
How could she think she was ugly ? ” someone wrote on Jezebel , a blog aimed at women in their twenties , reading that Megan hated the way she looked .
The pictures reminded one how costly an expression a smile can be for a girl of thirteen .
It was safer , Megan ’s pose suggested , to strike wary airs than to convey an earnestness that could be exploited by her enemies at school or , worse , on the Internet .
Like many teen - agers , Megan and her peers carried on an online social life that was more mercurial , and perhaps more crucial to their sense of status and acceptance , than the one they inhabited in the flesh .
On MySpace , and on other social - networking sites , such as Friendster and Facebook , a person can project a larger , more confident self , a nervy collection of favorite music , books , quotations , pleasures , and complaints .
He or she , able to play with different personas , is released from some of the petty humiliations of being a middle - schooler — all it takes to be a Ludacris fan is a couple of keystrokes .
But trying on identities is , in the fluid environment of the Internet , a riskier experiment than raiding Mom ’s makeup bag .
Squabbles that would take days to percolate in person can within seconds explode into full - blown wars .
Disputes can also become painfully public .
Sites allow users to rank their “ Top Friends , ” so that the ever - shifting alliances of a clique are posted , for all to see , in a sort of popularity ledger .
Likewise , polling applications enable a person to pose a question —
Is Caitlin hot or not ?— to his or her network of acquaintances , who can follow the results in real time , via a brightly colored thermometer icon ( as can Caitlin ) .
Teen - age identities mutate so quickly online , and can be masked so easily , that by the morning after Megan was pronounced dead Josh Evans had vanished from MySpace .
It was n’t until a month after her death that a neighbor named Michele Mulford told the Meiers that Curt and Lori Drew , who lived four houses down , had created “ Josh ” in concert with their thirteen - year - old daughter , a longtime friend of Megan’s .
( An eighteen - year - old girl who worked for the Drews was also involved . )
The two thirteen - year - olds had recently quarrelled .
Mulford ’s own daughter , also thirteen , had been given the password to the account , and had sent at least one unkind message to Megan in Josh ’s name .
Megan had accompanied the Drews on several vacations , and they knew that she was taking medication .
For nearly a year , on the advice of the police , the Meiers had kept quiet about the Drews ’ involvement in Megan ’s death .
After investigators determined that the Drews ’ actions , if cruel , had not broken any laws , the Meiers spoke with Steve Pokin , a columnist at the local paper , the Suburban Journals .
Pokin revealed the ruse in his column , “ Pokin ’ Around , ” on November 13th of last year .
“ I know that they did not physically come up to our house and tie a belt around her neck , ” Tina Meier told Pokin .
“ But when adults are involved and continue to screw with a thirteen - year - old — with or without mental problems — it is absolutely vile . ”
( Pokin did not name the Drews . )
Pokin ’s story threw first Dardenne Prairie and then everyone else — guidance counsellors , techies , First Amendment advocates , parents , bloggers , parenting bloggers — into paroxysms of recrimination .
They were all certain that something sick , and distinctly modern , had happened , but no one could agree about whether its source was a culture that encouraged teen - agers to act too grownup or one that permitted grownups to behave like teen - agers .
An Australian newspaper invoked the television show “ Desperate Housewives , ” declaring that Waterford Crystal Drive had “ been transformed into a real life version of Wisteria Lane . ”
Amid the furor , Jack Banas , the prosecuting attorney for St. Charles County , announced that he would reopen the case .
( Last week , a federal grand jury in California — where MySpace is based — issued subpoenas for a potential wire - fraud prosecution .
The Drews ’ lawyer says his clients have not received one . )
Back in the Meiers ’ living room , the correspondent for “ Good Morning America ” was attempting to warm up the Meiers — Ron , a tool - and - die maker , and Tina , a real - estate agent .
“ The producers in New York have some spectacu — um , really moving — pictures of the two angels , and I ’m going to have to ask you about that , ” he said .
Tina nodded .
A thirty - seven - year - old with wholesome features and a blond bob , she looked sallow and drawn .
So did Ron , a burly man wearing a plaid shirt .
Before the taping , Ron gave Tina a bereft , searching glance .
The cameraman was hoping to capture it .
“ Could you look at your wife again ? ” he said .
Then he asked Tina , “ Could you look at your husband ? ”
“ Stop ! ” Tina said , holding a palm up , before bursting into strained laughter .
“ We ’re getting a divorce . ”
When the filming was over , Tina drove to her mother ’s house , twenty minutes away .
Ron still lives on Waterford Crystal Drive .
So do the Mulfords and so do the Drews , whose porch light stayed on into the night .
The Automotive X Prize has announced who's in the race to build a production - ready car that tops 100 mpg , and the Tesla Motors , Aptera and German dieselmeisters Loremo are among the 66 entrants .
The Automotive X Prize formally announced the entrants , the $ 10 million purse and its official sponsor - Progressive Insurance - at the New York International Auto Show - and the competition 's drawn teams from nine countries .
The biggest name is Tesla Motors , which saw its all - electric Roadster start rolling off the assembly line on Monday .
We 've long known Aptera was a contender with its super - sleek Cessna - like three - wheeler ( that 's it in the picture ) .
Loremo - for low resistance mobile - uses a tiny two - cylinder diesel engine in a 990 - pound car to deliver 157 mpg .
So far , none of the major automakers has signed up , but teams have until later this year to join the fun .

The AXP has set the bar pretty high , and the competition is divided into two categories .
Mainstream cars must carry at least four people and have all the comforts you 'd expect in a production vehicle , including air conditioning , a stereo system and 10 cubic feet of cargo space .
They 've got to have four wheels , go from zero to 60 mph in under
12 seconds , hit at least 100 mph and have a range of 200 miles .
In other words , it 's got to be something people would buy .
That 's the point , says Dr. Peter H. Diamandis , chairman and CEO of the X Prize Foundation .
The cars must meet market needs for price , size , capability , safety and performance .
The contest " is a call to action to promote and inspire innovation , " he said .
" The environmentally friendly cars created as a result of this competition will affect everyone who drives in ways we can't even imagine today . "
The Tesla Roadster we all love so much ; photo courtesy Tesla Motors .
The rules are only slightly less stringent for alternative vehicles .
They must carry at least two people , hit 80 mph and have a range of 100
miles or better .
They can have any number of wheels .
Five cubic feet of cargo space - about what you 'd get with a Mazda MX - 5 Miata - is required .
All vehicles must surpass 100 mpg an equivalent amount of energy if powered by electricity , hydrogen , solar or any other fuel .
You can see all the guidelines here .
Entrants will have to prove their mettle during two long - distance stage races in
2009 and 2010 .
The contest will include a qualifying race and the " Grand Prize Final Race " that will combine speed , distance , urban driving and overall performance .
New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg said the Big Apple will host the first stage in September 2009 .
Its a safe bet Detroit will see a stage , and car - crazy Los Angeles seems like a lock since the X Prize Foundation is based in Santa Monica .
Progressive is based in Mayfield Village , Ohio - might we see a stage there too ?
The courses will " reflect typical consumer driving patterns , " contest officials said , and reflect real - world terrain , conditions and weather .
In other words , these cars wo n't be trailer queens hauled to a track somewhere .
They 'll be flogged mercilessly .
The prize will be divided 3:1 between the winners of the mainstream and alternative classes .
First place in each division goes to the team that has the lowest overall time for all stages and meets or exceeds the 100 mpg equivalent standard .
You can read about the AXP and two teams - Aptera and Illuminati Motor Works - in Eric Hagerman 's story " 1 Gallon of Gas , 100 Miles - $ 10 million : The Race to Build the Supergreen Car . "

Worries over the US economy have been undermining the dollar
At one stage , it took $ 1.5393 to buy a euro .
That is the weakest the dollar has traded at since the single European currency was launched in January 1999 .
Falling US interest rates have made it less attractive to hold the dollar .
The ECB 's decision to not cut rates meant investors continued to buy the European currency , boosting its value .
The Bank of England announced it was keeping UK rates on hold , too , which weakened the dollar against sterling .
The pound traded at over $ 2 for the first time this year .
The currency markets expect the Federal Reserve to cut US interest rates before central banks in the UK or Europe , which makes the dollar a less attractive investment .
Two gloomy reports on Wednesday raised expectations that the Fed will lower interest rates when it meets later this month .
The Commerce Department reported that new orders for manufactured goods fell 2.5 % in January , the biggest decline in five months .
A separate report from the Institute for Supply Management showed that activity in the US service sector shrank in February for the second month in a row .
On Sunday , a kinder , gentler Bill Clinton appeared before a crowd in California and gave a moving address .
While it was clear he was rallying for his wife ... his message uplifed both Hillary and Barack .
He talked about the history that was being made , the pride he felt to be alive to witness a Black man and a woman standing as serious contenders for the presidency .
The " charming , intoxicating Bill " was back and it was easy to become swept away .
It is very important to remember the stark differences between Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama .
You might not have time to read his book , " The Audacity of Hope " before Tuesday .
However , I reccommend that reading .
His values are different , his plans for the country are different , his stand on issues in the past have been different .
He is not more of the same .
His book again reminds you of that .
It gives you a glimpse into the soul of the man , the gift he will be to this nation , the caliber of human he is , and the vision of hope he keeps talking about and believes in to his core .
After reading it , watching him on the campaign trail and in debates and observing his reaction to the craziness that accompanies elections , I could understand why JFK 's daughter would call him " A Man Like My Father . "
His is not just a campaign promise , he has a vision for this nation that is rooted in real pain , real sorrow , real experience .
I am not talking about the kind of experience you get from working the corridors of congress , legislative halls , the White House or other government houses .
There is a line in a movie where one of the characters asks the man trying to recruit him to clean the back of his cab ... afterwhich he will listen to his recruitment message .
The smartly dressed exec hesistated .
The guy in turn asked ... you are not afraid to get gully are you ?
Genuine in his work , Barack Obama knows what people are going through cause he 's been right there fighting for them and with them .
After Senator Barack Obama spoke before a crowd of 20,000 people in Rodney Square in Wilmington , Delaware I heard a fellow blogger being interviewed on one of the local radio stations .
In that interview he said that a Hillary Clinton would n't offer the nation much more than a John McCain win .
He said they are very similar and the nation would simply get more Bush .
WOW !
I do n't know how true those statements are .
But I believe an Obama Presidency would not look anything like what we have now .
He is not another sympathizer .
He connects with people at a much different , real way .
When he tells you a story that has moved him , you feel it too ... it is not just a line in a prepared speech -- Genuine .
He is a family man ... not in words ... you see it in his regular interaction with his wife and children .
He talks about his family all the time .
He loves them and you hear that from him and see that in him and you can tell it is not campaign P.R. -- it is Genuine .
He is a real person , a real American .
You can see in his actions and discern from his words that he recognizes every day is a blessing ... although that blessing comes harder for some than others .
I believe him when he says whatever he can do to help he will .
But I value and respect the honesty in his words when he reminds us that he can't change things alone ... all of us must pitch in -- Genuine .
He does n't try to set himself up as a superhero that is going to save our day like so many of the others .
And it is that lie that has our nation currently so screwed up .
So in this historic contest , do n't get caught up with familiar words of comfort .
That would be the easiest thing to do , but not necessarily what America needs ... what people need .
We need a leader who respects us enough to tell us the truth , respectful of others in a way that will fix our international image and respected in a way that will naturally draw the aid of those needed to turn this country around , get Washington back in the business of the people and heal the nation .
We need the Genuine article -- Barack Obama .

While we ’ve got used to ‘ internet addiction ’ popping up in the media from time to time , it has inexplicably been the subject of an editorial in this month ’s American Journal of Psychiatry arguing it should be included in the DSM - IV – the next version of the diagnostic manual for psychiatry .
The editorial suggests that we should make ‘ internet addiction ’ a serious public health issue despite the fact that no - one yet has suggested anything that uniquely distinguishes it from its use as a tool or a source of entertainment .
For example , here are the components that the author , psychiatrist Jerald Block , cites as evidence that someone can become addicted to the internet :
1 ) excessive use , often associated with a loss of sense of time or a neglect of basic drives , 2 ) withdrawal , including feelings of anger , tension , and / or depression when the computer is inaccessible , 3 ) tolerance , including the need for better computer equipment , more software , or more hours of use , and 4 ) negative repercussions , including arguments , lying , poor achievement , social isolation , and fatigue
Apart from the fact that these and most other supposed criteria make no distinction between using the internet and what the person is using the internet for , it ’s easy to see that they do n’t describe anything unique to the net .
For example , here are my criteria for ‘ sports team addiction ’ :
1 ) excessive time following games , often associated with a loss of sense of time or a neglect of basic drives , 2 ) withdrawal , including feelings of anger , tension , and / or depression when team news or matches are inaccessible , 3 ) tolerance , including the need for better match viewing equipment , more news , or more hours of team - related activity , and 4 ) negative repercussions , including arguments , lying , poor achievement , social isolation , and fatigue
As more people in the world follow sports teams than have access to the internet , surely this is the more serious problem , especially considering the high levels of violence and alcohol abuse associated with this tragic affliction .
You may , of course , substitute whatever interest you want into the criteria to capture people who are the most motivated to pursue their favourite interest , or who are workaholics who rely on the technology ( if you want a retro version , substitute the ‘ postal system ’ for the internet for a 1908 style communication addiction ) .
Rather curiously , the editorial mentions the figure that 86 % of people with ‘ internet addiction ’ have another mental illness .
What this suggests is that heavy use of the internet is not the major problem that brings people into treatment .
In fact , ‘ internet addiction ’ , however it is defined , is associated with depression and anxiety but no - one has ever found this to be a causal connection .
Recent research shows that shy or depressed people use the internet excessively to ( surprise , surprise ) meet people and manage their shyness .
And in fact , as I mentioned in an earlier article , one of the only longitudinal studies [ pdf ] on the general population found that internet use is generally associated with positive effects on communication , social involvement , and well - being , although interestingly , those who were already introverts show increased withdrawal .
In other words , the internet is a communication tool and people use it manage their emotional states , like they do with any other technology .
Of course there are some people who are depressed and anxious who use the internet ( or follow sports teams , or read books , or watch TV … ) to excess , but why we have to describe this as an addiction still completely baffles me .

From the current New Scientist :
In an experiment dubbed " Cola Wars " , [ Nick Epley ] conducted a taste test with a twist : he told participants which cola was Coke and which was Pepsi before tasting began .
After tasting , all they had to do was estimate what percentage of their friends would be able to distinguish between the two in a blind taste test .
Studies show that people ’s ability to do this is no better than chance – so an answer around 50 per cent would be right .
What Epley found was intriguing .
When he motivated volunteers to give a considered response – by offering them a cash payment – their answers tended to be close to 50 per cent .
Subjects who were not paid , however , seemed to answer with an egocentric bias : since they knew which cola was which , they assumed that a high proportion of their friends would guess correctly ( Journal of Personality and Social Psychology , vol 87 , p 327 ) .
For Epley , the finding supports his idea that putting yourself inside the head of another person and considering their perspective requires a cognitive effort that simple egocentric judgements do not .

In a move that illustrates how television networks are girding for a protracted battle with striking TV writers while also scrambling to fill major programming holes , interactive karaoke restaurant Spotlight Live is closing in on a production deal , The Post has learned .
According to three sources familiar with the situation , broadcast networks ABC , CBS , NBC , The CW and a handful of cable networks held informal talks with Spotlight founder Jen Worthington before the writers strike began about developing a TV show based on Spotlight ’s concept .
A source inside NBC said the network thought Spotlight , a Times Square club and restaurant that features five professional recording booths and provides professional backup singers and dancers for would - be performers , might be a nice fit with the network ’s theme parks , or could be a show broadcast on cable or video - on - demand .
While informal at first , sources said the networks ’ talks with Spotlight , which is being repped by Creative Artists Agency , have ramped up since the writers strike began Nov. 5 , and a deal could be in place in time for 2008 ’s mid-season .
Spotlight ’s talks with the networks have intensified as the antagonism mounts between networks and striking TV writers , and as network sources privately say they do n’t expect a resolution to the strike before March .
Worthington declined comment for this story .
The networks mentioned either declined comment or could not be reached for comment .
Prior to the beginning of the strike , the networks ordered a plethora of reality - show programming that they hoped would tide them over until a deal was reached .
But with a resolution not expected anytime soon , sources said the networks will likely need to greenlight additional reality - show programming .
Each new reality - show deal accomplishes two goals for the networks .
First , because reality shows do n’t employ writers , they fill the void created by scripted programming that has been halted or canceled due to the strike .
Second , it signals to writers that the networks can withstand a strike indefinitely .
Spotlight , where Jennifer Lopez and Alicia Keys have performed , already has some powerful partners on the music and Internet side of its business in SonyBMG ’s Epic Records and cable company Comcast , respectively .
Epic has agreed to provide studio time and to record , produce , distribute and market a single from eight winning singers selected by Spotlight ’s diners , an online audience and Epic judges .
Comcast streams videos of the performers through its Ziddio unit .

At age 4 , while other kids were thinking about taking off their training wheels , Eric Robinson took up dirt biking .
" Crashing only gave me more confidence , " he says .
Since then , he 's added motocross , triathlons and snowboarding to his repertoire .
So as president of College Park Industries , which manufactures prosthetic feet , it makes perfect sense that he led the company to found the O&P Extremity Games -- referring to orthotics and prosthetics -- open to people who have lost a limb or have some sort of limb difference .
Many of College Park 's customers are older people who have diabetes and lose a foot to gangrene , but there are a number of young , athletic people who have lost limbs in accidents .
It was that demographic that Robinson and his 55 employees found themselves talking to in recent years about the company 's high - tech product , which costs around $ 6,000 .
" We were always talking to people wearing the product , and they were all telling us how they would participate in sporting events , " says Robinson .
" They were skateboarding , skydiving , and they 'd tell us that our product enabled them to go out and continue doing extreme events . "
So in 2006 , in Orlando , Florida , far from their Fraser , Michigan , headquarters , the first Extremity Games , offering events like rock climbing , surfing and kayaking , took place .
Another one followed in 2007 .
But if you had met Robinson , now 39 , a little more than 10 years ago , when he first started working at the business his father , David , began , you 'd never have guessed the company would be involved in extreme sports .
College Park Industries , when it formed in 1982 , was called Tangent Tool and made tools for the auto industry .
The best Robinson could have hoped for is that they might someday have a company softball team .
The business evolved into manufacturing prosthetic feet when Robinson , then 17 years old , and his family were in their living room watching a PBS documentary about low - cost prosthetic feet being made in India .
" We could do that , " said David , and later at a Chinese restaurant , he sketched out a design .
They incorporated as College Park Industries in 1988 , and since David was more an inventor than an entrepreneur , Robinson left college during his sophomore year to help run the company .
In 1997 , after David died at the age of 53 , Robinson became president of the $ 5 million company .
Since then , the company 's income has doubled .
Now Robinson is giving his customers and other athletes with prosthetics a place to compete in extreme sports .
And every year , he 's blown away by the competitions and competitors .
The oldest participant last year was 60 years old , missing a foot from a hunting accident , and competed in the rock climbing event .
Another rock climber lost an arm in Iraq .
Yet another athlete lost a leg in a motorcycle accident a few years ago and now skateboards on a half pipe .
Hearing how many of these athletes were snowboarding , Robinson , an avid skier , was inspired to give it a try ; now it 's his preference whenever he needs to hurtle his body down the side of a mountain .
" The feeling is liquid movement , " raves Robinson .
" I think I can understand the religious surfers a little better now . "
Currently , Robinson is trying to attract more corporate sponsorships for the Extremity Games .
His board of directors decided to cut back on the event 's expenses , since costs can run up to $ 500,000 a year .
In 2008 , the games will be held near their offices in Michigan .
" I have to say , personally , I view extreme sports as an outlet , " says Robinson .
" It gives me an incredible amount of exhilaration , and then there 's that little fear of death , just a little bit .
You 're on the edge , it invigorates you and puts passion back into my life .
I love competing in extreme sports , and I love watching them .
I think it 's awesome . "

This code will throw deprecation warnings in newer Django checkouts – see the Paginator Update post for an improved version that should work with the recent trunk .
These days I had to implement pagination with Django for the first time .
Actually , that ’s not entirely true – but thus far it had always been simple cases where the object_list ( ) generic view and next / previous links were good enough .
This time around , I wanted something more advanced .
It turns out that Django ’s pagination code is not that great .
It does it ’s core job very well , but it is not stateful in that it does n’t know anything about the current page – instead , you have to pass that value along with each function call .
Which means that out of the box it ’s pretty much unusable from within a template .
Also , I wanted a more advanced pagination that would display a sensible range of pages for direct selection – apparently , this is now officially called “ digg- style ” .
There is at least one such paginator for Django around , but it ’s based on an inclusion tag – a concept I am not too fond of .
Somehow , I do n’t like the idea of Python code ( the view ) referring to a template , referring back to Python code ( the tag ) , referring back to a template , and maybe going even further from there .
I like knowledge of templates and their locations to be restricted to my view layer .
So I decided to give a different approach a shot , putting an object into the template context that could be used to build the pagination .
I ’ve posted it to DjangoSnippets .
Use it like this :
objects = MyModel.objects.all ( ) paginator = DiggPaginator ( objects , 10 , body=6 , padding=2 , page=7 ) return render_to_response('template.html ' , {' paginator ' : paginator}
The paginator will provide one to three blocks of pages ( first pages , last pages , and adjacents of the current page ) .
Depending on the total number of pages , the active page and the paginator options , those blocks may be merged together ) .
body is the size of the block that contains the currently active page , tail the number of pages in the leading and trailing blocks .
padding determines the minimum number of options to the left or right of the active page .
This is only relevant when it comes to expanding a tail block into the middle block , as the padding of the latter is defined by it ’s size ( body ) .
The last option , margin , defines when two blocks are merged .
It ’s the minimum number of pages required between two blocks .
If margin is 3 while the start block ends with page 9 , and the middle block starts with 11 , the two blocks will end up as one .
A template would look something like the following .
Pretty much all the variables the object_list generic view provides are available as attributes .
{ % if paginator .
has_next %}{# pagelink paginator . next # }{ % endif %} { % for page in paginator .
page_range %} { % if not page %} ... { % else % }{# pagelink page #} { % endif %} { % endfor %}
Here is an example in action .
Okay ,
So I read Ms. Kimball 's statement .
All the actions she claimed were in a public classroom in the presence of other adults .
Mr. Holden was doing so in the context of what is legally / culturally an appropriate form of touching between an adult male and female vs. an adult and a child .
Could it be that she was just too dam sensitive , as there did not seem to be any substatiating statements from other females or other adults in that room , only that her feelings were hurt or that she was embarrassed .
Are you really trying to take a cheap shot here at Mr. Holden given his great success and pioneering efforts in the containment model of sex offenders .
Certainly this minor civil effort by Ms. Kimball bears no comparison to the over all effort and accomplishments of Mr. Holden .
I think that a stronger case on the face of it could be made regarding this site attempting to assist self admitted sex offenders ordered into a program , with the clear knowledge that if successful , such advice would only cause further child victims , juvenile males and females .
Dr. Eric Holden wears a figurative white hat overall , whereas YOU wear no less than a dark gray one if not a black hat .
There is no good result from you actually seeking out / soliciting sex offenders as you have in Dallas - Ft. Worth .
You have really overstepped your bounds and sense of self worth and purpose / importance .
It started with an internet campaign against Robert Malley .
Malley , who worked on the Clinton team at the failed Camp David Israel - Palestinian peace talks in 2000 , had fetched up in a long list of people who advise Barack Obama on foreign policy .
Mr Malley , who now works for the International Crisis Group , is not on the Obama staff , or anywhere near it .
But it still triggered a series of hostile comments apparently designed to undermine the candidate 's credibility with Jewish voters .
Most appeared in conservative blogs and websites , but according to Newsweek , attacks on Malley also surfaced in emails sent out by staffers on Hillary Clinton 's campaign team .
Some of the blogs had dwelt on Malley 's Egyptian - born " anti- Israel " father .
But his real crime was to have challenged , including in two thoughtful articles written in 2001 and 2004 in the New York Review of Books , the conventional wisdom about the Camp David collapse .
This prevailing view ( one also not shared by everyone in the Israeli intelligence community ) not only laid the blame exclusively on Yasser Arafat but also held that the Palestinian leader never wanted a real and lasting two state solution to the conflict .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
It was one issue Malley disagreed about with Denis Ross , his immediate boss at Camp David , in his 2004 piece , a lengthy but respectful critique of Ross 's book about the peace process .
The other was that Malley took a more forward position than Ross , post Camp David , in urging that the US , " building on " the Clinton blueprint for a solution , " ought to push the parties toward ending their conflict , rather than wait until they are somehow ready to do so . "
As interesting as the anti-Malley campaign , however , was the phalanx of former US Middle East diplomats who sprang to his defence against " vicious , personal , " claims that he " harbours an anti-Israel agenda . "
They issued a statement saying that whatever " the real differences between us " the smears were " an effort to undermine the credibility of a talented public servant who has worked tirelessly over the years to promote Arab - Israeli peace and US national interests . "
The signatories included two experts now on the list of advisers to Hillary Clinton 's campaign : Sandy Berger and Martin Indyk , Daniel Kurtzer – appointed by President Bush as US ambassador to Israel from 2001 to 2005 – and Ross himself .
Unwittingly or not , the diplomats were saying something important about the impoverished discourse on the Israel - Palestinian conflict in American politics .
By defending Malley , those who knew his work best have drawn attention to a fact US aspirants to high office usually feel it is essential to ignore – Hillary Clinton 's lavish praise for the West Bank separation barrier as currently routed springs to mind – namely that it is not necessarily " anti-Israel " to criticise Israeli policy from time to time .
But actually it goes deeper even than this .
In the world view of many in the American Israel Public Affairs Committee , the most powerful – though not necessarily the most representative – Jewish lobbying group in the US , attitudes to the Middle East are zero sum .
You are pro-Israeli or pro-Palestinian but you can not be both .
This of course conveniently buries a key argument – one heard far more in Israel than in US debate – that an urgent end to the occupation is in Israel 's as well as the Palestinians ' interest .
In a Haaretz article this week Akiva Eldar pointed out that AIPAC " does not really bother to rally in favour of a two state solution " .
While those it sees as " friends of Israel " certainly include hardliners who believe in a greater Israel stretching from the Mediterranean to Jordan , those who criticise Israel for not moving fast enough in its own long - term security interests towards the just two state solution it says it wants , are enemies .
This is all the more perverse , now that the Israeli Prime Minister , Ehud Olmert , has suggested publicly that the failure to negotiate a peace with the Palestinians may imperil Israel 's very existence as a Jewish state .
Yet it remains hard to imagine a US politician bold enough to say the same thing without risking his own electability .
To go further still , of course , and suggest limited engagement with Hamas , as Malley has also done , is beyond the pale .
Yet is it really " anti-Israel " to do so when a growing clutch of Israeli ex-generals , academics , and Israel 's most celebrated novelist Amos Oz – all serious Zionists who unlike AIPAC 's most hawkish members actually live there – also want talks with Hamas on one issue or another ?
Is it necessarily " anti-Israel " to suggest that a Gaza ceasefire agreement with Hamas might be a better way of securing the release of Corporal Gilad Shalit and bringing peace of mind to the beleaguered citizens of Sderot – one of whom was killed yesterday by a Qassam rocket – than a perilous military invasion , when an opinion poll yesterday shows that 64 per cent of Israelis want just such an agreement ?
It is a safe bet that Obama will not be urging talks with Hamas .
But last Sunday at a private meeting with Jewish leaders in Ohio he did make a small contribution to unfreezing the debate on the Middle East in American politics .
For the candidate identified " a strain within the pro-Israel community that says unless you adopt an unwavering pro-Likud approach to Israel that you 're anti-Israel " and added : " That ca n't be the measure of our friendship with Israel . "
This may seem stunningly obvious , yet it has attracted accusations of " interference " in internal Israeli politics .
The breaking of one taboo , however modest , raises the question of whether he might , if elected to the White House , break another by seeing the conflict as a first term agenda item .
For if Olmert is serious about wanting a deal with Mahmoud Abbas but is being thwarted by internal political pressure , probably the only thing that could save it is the full throttle engagement of a US administration which Malley , among others , long sought ; an engagement which for all his warm words , Bush has so far all but eschewed , insisting that the US can only " facilitate " a process when both sides really want it .
The critics are divided between those who see Malley 's – and Jimmy Carter 's point man Zbignew Brezinsky 's – appearance on the Obama list as sinister despite their minor - to - negligible role ; and those like the New Republic editor Marty Peretz , who combine support for Obama with resolute defence of Israeli policy over many years , and has insisted Obama would not dream of taking Malley 's advice .
In fact the greater danger would not be if Obama did listen – among many others – to people like Malley , a man who has long argued persuasively that a just peace would be directly in US and Israeli interests , but if he did n't .

Olson was n't brought to trial for almost a quarter of a century
Sarah Jane Olson was freed on Monday after seven years in jail for attempted bombings and second - degree murder during a campaign in 1975 .
But officials found an " administrative error " , and realised she still had one more year to serve before being freed .
Olson 's lawyer said the California prison authorities were " bowing to political pressure " .
Olson , 61 , will not now be eligible for parole until March 2009 .
Formerly known as Kathleen Soliah , she was a member of the militant Symbionese Liberation Army .
The group became famous for kidnapping newspaper heiress Patty Hearst in 1974 .
Olson then went on the run for almost a quarter of a century , marrying and living undetected in Minnesota .
Release criticised
After a tip - off , she was arrested in 1999 and in 2001 she was found guilty of attempted bombings .
In 2003 she also pleaded guilty to second - degree murder over the death of bank customer in a 1975 robbery near Sacramento .
In all , she was sentenced to 14 years in prison .
Her early release brought protests from a Los Angeles police officers union .
On Friday , she was detained at Los Angeles airport , as she was about to fly to Minnesota .
She had informed her parole officer about the journey .
She will now be returned to the same prison from which she was released earlier in the week .
Officials said that the error in her release date was because of a failure to factor the second sentence into her parole calculations .
But Olson 's lawyer said that was " ridiculous " .
" We received an order from the state parole board more than a month ago informing us that she would be released on 17 March , " said Shawn Chapman Holley .
" The idea that suddenly they discovered an error is untrue , " she added .
" As far as we 're concerned they 're bowing to political pressure and they are wrong . "
The Symbionese Liberation Army formed in Berkeley , California in the 1970s , committed to fighting against what it said was an oppressive governmental regime .
The group carried out a series of bombings , murders and robberies before most of its members were killed in a dramatic fire in 1974 after a gun battle with Los Angeles police .
BEIJING  China announced a further sharp increase in military spending on Tuesday , a day after the United States renewed its warning that a lack of openness surrounding the rapid buildup of China ’s armed forces posed a threat to stability in Asia .
China ’s military budget for 2008 will increase by 17.6 percent to 417.8 billion yuan , or about $ 58.8 billion , Jiang Enzhu , spokesman for the National People ’s Congress , China ’s legislature , said at a news conference .
This follows a 17.8 percent increase in 2007 .
Military experts in the United States and elsewhere say Beijing ’s real military spending is at least double the announced figure .
But even if it was double , China ’s yearly military budget would still be only about one - fourth the size of the Pentagon’s .
Before the annual legislative session , which begins Wednesday , Mr. Jiang also said the situation in the Taiwan Strait was “ grim and complex , ” and called on the Taiwanese president , Chen Shui-bian , to halt what Beijing described as unacceptable moves toward independence .
China considers the island of Taiwan a breakaway province .

Print This Email This Vice President fishing on Oman sultan 's yacht Wednesday
On the fifth anniversary of President George W. Bush 's invasion of Iraq , President Bush said he has no doubts about waging the unpopular war despite the " high cost in lives and treasure . "
Vice President Dick Cheney had a different message .
Informed during a Good Morning America interview broadcast Wednesday that two - thirds of Americans now think the war was not worth fighting , Cheney said : " So ? " " So you do n't care what the American people think ? " ABC 's Martha Raddatz asked .
He added : " I think we can not be blown off course by the fluctuations of the public opinion polls .
There has in fact been fundamental change and transformation and improvement for the better .
That 's a huge accomplishment . "
Cheney added that the economy was going through a " rough patch , there 's no question about it . "
The White House later released a transcript which shows that Cheney 's first response was n't " so " as ABC presented on its broadcast .
When first informed by Raddatz that " two - thirds of Americans say [ the Iraq war ] was not worth fighting , " the vice president responded , " They ought to go spend time , like you and I have , Martha .
You know what 's been happening in Iraq .
You 've been there as much as anybody .
There has , in fact , been fundamental change and transformation , and improvement for the better .
I think even you would admit that . "
The Vice President is in Oman .
Today , he went fishing in the waters between Oman and Iran , borrowing the Sultan of Oman 's 60 - foot royal yacht .
A Cheney spokeswoman told the Associated Press that the vice president , his wife Lynne , and daughter , Liz , a former State Department official who is traveling with her father as a private citizen , headed out under sunny skies into the Gulf of Oman on " Kingfish I , " owned by Sultan Qaboos bin Said .
Cheney has had a personal relationship with the sultan going back to the time when the vice president was defense secretary , but the sultan did not go along on the fishing trip .
Oman allows the United States to use four air bases -- including one just 50 miles from Iran -- for refueling , logistics and storage of pre-positioned military supplies .

Canada was shocked to its honest - to - goodness core this week by the news that the country 's PC repairmen are undermining its sweet as maple syrup image .
Canadian TV show CBC Marketplace did a hidden camera investigation into computer repair firms to see how many technicians could correctly fix a hardware problem .
Of the 10 filmed , only three were able to diagnose the fault : a blown memory module which would cost just $ 25 to replace .
CBC 's targets included Geek Squad and Nerds On Site .
The film highlighted a stark inconsistency among the repairs carried out .
One bloke suggested that the computer would need to be sent to a dust - free room at a staggering $ 2,000 cost .
Others advised that the computer 's motherboard should be replaced . ®
Here 's the film in all its baffling glory :

Civil liberties groups call for end of Wikileaks blackout Nick Juliano

Print This Email This Claim shutdown of leaked docs ' site violates First Amendment Civil liberties and open government activists are joining whistle - blower Web forum Wikileaks in a court battle after a California judge ordered an internet provider to shut down the site 's domain name this month .
The American Civil Liberties union says Wikileaks , which allows users to anonymously post sensitive government and business documents , serves the public interest and argues that the Wikileaks.org blackout violates the Constitutional rights of its users .
ï¿½The public has a right to receive information and ideas , especially ones concerning the public interest , " says Aden Fine , a senior ACLU attorney .
" This injunction ignores that vital First Amendment principle .ï¿½
The ACLU was joined by the Electronic Frontier Foundation in filing a motion to intervene in the court battle between Wikileaks and Swiss bank Julius Baer , which was implicated in money laundering activities in documents posted to the site .
On Feb. 15 a federal judge in California issued a permanent injunction against Dynadot LLC , which registered Wikileaks domain name , ordering it to ban access to wikileaks.org .
Wikileaks ' content is still available through several mirror sites , but EFF says the case should warn Internet users about the influence companies have over access to their content .
" This unwarranted injunction should remind everyone who hosts critical information on the Web that such information may only remain accessible as long as your service provider or registrar is willing to stand up for you against obviously overreaching legal attacks , " said EFF Staff Attorney Matt Zimmerman .
Documents posted to Wikileaks have had global impact , documenting censorship in Thailand and political corruption in Kenya .
The site has sparked much discussion in the US as well , revealing details about the treatment of prisoners at Guantanamo bay and rules of engagement for US troops in Iraq .
ï¿½Journalists , academics , and the general public have a legitimate interest in accessing the materials found on Wikileaks in order to inform their work and participate in public debate , ï¿½ said Ann Brick , staff attorney with the ACLU of Northern California .
ï¿ ½Blocking access to the entire site in response to a few documents posted there completely disregards the publicï¿½s right to know .
It ï¿½s unconstitutional and un-American .ï¿½
Bush set to veto bipartisan health insurance bill RAW STORY
Published : Wednesday December 12 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This President Bush on Wednesday was ready to veto legislation that passed with bipartisan support to dramatically expand government - provided health insurance for children .
It would be Bush 's seventh veto in seven years .
Bush vetoed an earlier version of the health insurance program .
The bill passed the Democratic - controlled Senate by a veto - proof margin , but the same was not true in the House .
Even after the bill was approved , negotiations continued on a compromise version .
A major point of contention with the White House was Bush 's demand that nearly all poor children eligible for the program be found and enrolled before those in slightly higher - income families could be covered .
Bush also has opposed using an increased tobacco tax to fund the program expansion .
The bill includes a 61 - cent rise on a package of cigarettes .
The replacement measure was designed to meet Republican objections to the first bill .
But it was little changed .
It would increase funding for the State Children 's Health Insurance Program by $ 35 billion over five years , in order to add an estimated 4 million people to an existing program that provides insurance coverage for children from families who earn too much to qualify for Medicaid but cannot afford private insurance .
The joint federal - state program currently provides benefits to roughly 6 million people , mostly children .
Bush 's veto in early October of a similar bill was narrowly upheld by the House .
But the votes are uncomfortable for GOP lawmakers .
It is a popular program with the public , making some Republicans wary of sticking with Bush on such an issue with the 2008 elections looming .
Of the 43 million people nationwide who lack health insurance , more than 6 million are under 18 years old .
That 's more than 9 percent of all children .
Democratic leaders have tried to capitalize on this dynamic to win more Republicans to their side on the bill , but so far Bush has maintained a veto - proof majority , at least in the House .
A two - thirds vote in both chambers is required to override a presidential veto .

We spoke with Diaz by phone last week ( before his Pulitzer win was announced ) about language , politics , gender , and how “ Oscar Wao ” was originally conceived as a multi-media experience , complete with an illustrated section that would mimic the comic books Oscar so loved .
Diaz admits , however , that awards do n’t mean much to him when it comes right down to it : “ My friends all think I 'm so crazy .
I 'm more worried about the next text than I am like , enjoying resting on these laurels .
I need to learn to do that more , I 'll live longer if I do .
It 's tremendously gratifying , of course , that people are interested in the book and want to read it , that there 's been this much attention given to a piece of fiction that 's about a crazy Dominican family , of course , it 's wonderful .
But for me , that feeling lasts only pico-seconds .
I really just want to write stuff that only takes five years to finish ! ”
The thing about author Junot Diaz is , one minute he’s on the phone with you , rapping about meringue , Malcolm X , comic books , and how shit never gets done on time in the Dominican Republic – and the next minute , he ’s winning the Pulitzer Prize for fiction for his novel The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao .
He describes himself as just another ordinary , poor immigrant kid from Jersey , but the book tells a different story : that of an author alive with passion for his roots , for language , and for the moments of silence , linguistic and cultural , that can bring a family together and also tear it apart .

Would you ever write a book in Spanish ?
Naw .
I mean , I basically learned to read and write in English , and I think that in the end that 's probably going to be my life 's tongue .
But you never know , I never think about it in that way .
What ’s crazy is the way that the politics of these languages work in real life– people kind of forget that for most young people , the language that they 're saddled with was n't a choice .
I came over [ from the Dominican Republic ] so young that speaking English was n't a choice , it was a basic form of reality on the ground .
Is “ Oscar Wao ” being published in the Dominican Republic ?
Are you going do any press for it there ?
Yes , it 'll be out in September .
The thing is , in Santo Domingo , it 's really all up to the folks over there , and everything 's very last minute .
So there 's no point making plans for six months from now .
So far I have to go back to Santo Domingo three times this next two months for literary stuff , so I 'm sure something will come up in September .
Everything is done in Santa Domingo last second , you know ?
So your Spanish is still pretty good , but how 's your Nerdish ?
It 's terrible .
That ’s the more honest truth – my Sindarin and Quenya are just terrible now !
Yet sci-fi and fantasy genres play a huge role in this book .
You build so much of the book around references to The Lord of the Rings , The Fantastic Four , comic books , Dungeons and Dragons – how does the fantasy world work in this book ?
My sense of it is just sort of the mythic dream of what the United States is – I do n't think that 's any more or less ridiculous than somebody believing in and organizing their lives around Lord of the Rings .
It 's all make believe in some ways , it 's just some of it is more respected than others .
What about the academic resistance to sci-fi and fantasy as a genre ?
Why ca n’t these genres be used to say something significant about our modern moment ?
Everyone has an obsession with everybody else ’s language .
There 's a lot at stake for people who are disqualifying or disavowing certain linguistic registers and valuing others .
It 's basically the way we organize ourselves : literary criticism , yes , Tolkien , no .
If you talk to MFA people , it always goes like this : creative writing yes , literary criticism no .
The reverse is also true for literary critics : criticism yes , creative writing no .
I just find it so bizarre that people who work on language have these opinions .
Being against a language form is just as absurd as Canute the Beast trying to order or command the sea .
It 's more about your own craziness than anything about the way the language works .
So you really can't be – I 'm not looking for excuses to restrict linguistic registers at the border , I 'm looking for excuses to deploy all sorts of language .
Through my own educational process I was always being told by one group or another that one language is good , one language is bad .
Even people who are supposed to be defenders of language , they 'll always sneak in their biases , you know : " I think it 's really really great , but do n't bring any sci - fi stories into my class . "
Let ’s talk then about the kinds of words that are okay to use and the kinds that are n’t .
You use the word “ nigger ” a lot in this book .
Have you gotten any pushback from people about being a Latino writer and using that word ?
It 's one of those things , I mean -- there 's a ton of child rape in this book too .
Does that mean I 'm a child rapist , I endorse child rape ?
I mean , the word nigger exists in the world .
And some people are n’t okay with a Latino writer using it , and you know what ?
That 's really cool !
That 's the difference that we 're talking about , is it real life or is it art ?
When it comes right down to it , so child rape should only be represented by child rapists ?
Or if you represent child rape in a book , does this speak to your relationship with child rape ?
Or is there something far more complicated going on , with the concept of representations , or the concept of deploying " taboo " language and who deploys it ?
I do n't ever remember Oscar calling anybody nigger , or Lola using that word – it's coming from Yunior specifically .
It 's easy to assume that because there 's one person in a culture or group using that word , that everyone 's using it .
But I find that part of what the book is about is about who uses what language and how they 're using it .
There is something about the way Yunior uses language that is worth really interrogating .
I totally understand people 's political decisions about language , vis -a - vis their decisions about their practice and their life , but I just feel like when issues of representation are up in the air , you have to use a much wider palette .
We 're trying to talk about the world .
I guess this is n't an essay about for or against the " n word " , it 's sort of a larger argument about the world , so that everything in the world , positive and negative , should find its way into a book .
There 's something surprisingly reductive about how people are always trying to scratch books out of existence .
That means we 've got to get of almost everything by Mark Twain !
I mean , after all , Malcolm X is of Caribbean descent .
He 's not purely African American descent , if I remember correctly , part of his family is either from St Lucia or St Croix .
[ Editor 's note : Malcolm X's mother was born in Grenada , in the southeastern Caribbean sea ] .
So he should n't use it either , right ?!
What I find interesting is that I 'm neither for nor against who should use certain words or not .
But there 's a tremendous amount at stake in trying to control how language is used .
Did you ever think about writing “ Oscar ” in comic book form ?
There was supposed to be a whole illustrated chapter , this was supposed to be one of those multi-media texts .
But as so often happens , the book wanted to be what it ended up being .
So all my smarty - pants ideas about the book , they were just for naught , for naught !
Would you ever think about writing a sci fi genre novel ?
It all depends .
I had ideas about this book , but those ideas quickly – my conscious , executive ideas were undone by the power of the unconscious masses .
I mean , yeah , I would n't mind making the executive decision and try to write a straight up sci - fi novel , but at the end it would just be all about Dominicans again !
But I 'll give it a shot one day , I 'm sure .
I guess I always start in one place and end up usually ten thousand miles away .

Lots of people ask you about why it took you so long to write this book .
It 's an easier question to ask than to read the book carefully and talk about it .
Now that it 's done , is it worth it ?
I mean , do you say to yourself , I spent all this time on this book , I feel like I did it right , that it was a worthwhile experience ?
I do n't know – in the end , what I 'm really thinking about is , I hope the next one does n't take that long !
The immediate applause is interesting – and you 're like " hey , this is great ! "
But what I 'm really thinking about is the future .
I 'm really thinking about -- what 's going on now ?
What 's coming up next ?
How 's everything going to work ?
I think that that 's more on my mind than anything else .
The book was recently optioned by Miramax .
Would you be involved in a film version of “ Oscar Wao . ”
Well , they have n't even cut the check , so you know !
These things take so incredibly long .
I could say " yeah ! " and then tomorrow , I 'll be completely gone from the situation .
It 's one of those things where only when it 's done , can you say you had anything to do with it .
That 's the way the movie business works .
As long as the tiny little check they gave me clears , they can do whatever they want with it !
A lot of this book focuses on different types of masculinity , specifically Dominican masculinity .
Yunior on the one hand is a player , he ’s very promiscuous , and then on the other hand you have Oscar , this nerd who ca n’t get a girl to save his life , and he ’s terrified of dying a virgin .
How were you trying to represent a male Dominican experience ?
The one thing this book cautions you about is thinking about itself as a totalizing text – because it 's the opposite of disappearing , it becomes too present , it becomes a dictatorship .
The whole problem with authority and with having one person who 's an expert , one text that explains it all – you know , a “ Dominica - nomicon ” – you know , it becomes dictatorial .
And if anything , this is a text that is terrified of dictatorships .
Part of what I 'm very much interested in is a sort of multi- determined , complicated , nuanced look at how New World masculinity plays itself out in a local area like the Dominican Republic .
I mean , I could be wrong , there 's lots of unconscious stuff here more than conscious stuff , but I thought the DR was the kind of case study for a larger argument about the world , how that developed , what are some of its lures and what are some of its dangers .
How hard was it for you to get into the female subjectivity , to view things from the perspective of Lola , Belicia , La Inka ?
Ones of the good things is that I was n't trying to direct it , it was all being filtered through Yunior ’s voice .
What I was happiest with , even though these women are being filtered through this aberrant , weirdly masculine , polymathic voice , what I wanted to get across was that the sense that you were encountering the female subjectivity despite all this white noise from Yunior .
That a voice like Yunior could , without losing itself , render what it 's like to be around these kinds of women .
But the reader reacts very viscerally to a character like Belicia – you ca n’t help but get angry at her , for her violence towards her children .
But man , you know – people are fucked up !
You know , our vision of ourselves is always so much more positive than who we really are .
The thing with Belicia – in my mind , that was a very honest representation of her .
But most of us ?
Nobody knows who we are .
And what if somebody jumped into your head , you know ?
And got to see everything that you are , all the sorts of things you thought about , all your cowardice and fear : the representations would be a little bit rougher than you 're accustomed to .
I hoped everybody would be able to see her despite her bitchiness , to see her longing .
I guess because all my life I 've grown up around Dominican women , I have sisters who were a huge impact on me , I 've been dating a Dominican woman more or less for the past ten years .
Part of me feels , as an artist , if I can't create a tribute , or at least a map of the world I encountered being around certain kinds of Dominican women in the 90's and the 2000's , I 'd feel , like , lame as an artist .
I mean , I 've spent all this time with them and they would be like come on , is that the best you can do ?
How did the research process work for you ?
How did you research the historical aspects ?
What about the nerdy Parts ?
The real tough stuff was the historical stuff .
It was a ton of raw research , it was just me and there was all this work I was doing just getting the information , and there was all this information I already carried inside of me , because I was such a history nerd , and I am such a history nerd , and it's all this crap I carried inside of me , you know .
I had all this stuff inside of me , and it was just interesting to find out how I could make all these connections , in my head .
What was the hardest thing was to create these two webs [ of the present - day narrative and the historical narrative ] , these two structural webs that worked with each other ; one web of signification and of plot and structure with that kind of nerdish stuff ?
And then one that showed all this information about all this nerdishness , I did n't want to be completely fluent in nerdishness , I wanted to have this narrative , so that if you follow the nerdish references to a logical conclusion it organizes the book in a different way , and it allows you to see the book quite differently – and then the sort of historical arguments that are being made in the more historical sections , if you actually follow them to their conclusions , or if you ask yourself , in both areas , what is missing ?
And why is it missing ?
And you begin to fill in all sorts of kooky ass information .
So yeah , man it took a lot of work , but what took more work out of that was how to do this , so that both sections worked with each other , and that both sections depending on how you entered them , or how you engaged them , would create a different book .
And that 's what I wanted to do .
If you follow the historical argument , you would have one kind of book , but if you got off on some of the nerdy shit ?
It creates a totally different book .
And I wanted the book to be different books , so you 're not just like , oh so the difference is that Oscar has hair here or does n't have hair there .
I read so much , interviewed so many people , and then you also have to become fluent in this stuff , it ’s not just knowing it , you have to talk and think it for months and months and months .
I mean , you can't crack fucking jokes about this shit unless you know it inside and out .
You speak very highly of your experiences in college , at Rutgers University .
You 're a poor fuckin kid from Dominican New Jersey , from a neighborhood you never left , I mean I certainly never met a girl who liked to read .
Never met an activist , you know ?
Going to college was like immigrating again except it was n't as fucked up , it was actually kind of fun .
I mean , it was n't fuckin paradise , I mean , I worked my way through college , delivering fuckin pool tables .
I mean , I know kids who say they worked their way through college and they had a fuckin work study job at the library , you know ?
I was fuckin working my ass off , so it was n't a fun ass joke , but compared to what immigration was like when I was a kid ?
I was like , shit yeah , this is great !
You get ass , people invite you to smoke weed , you meet people from all over the world , you read books you can't believe ever could have been written .
You get with activists , you get to travel , you know .
Nothing startles me on a daily basis more than what we ’re all capable of , and how things can work out if we ’re just given a little bit of support – all these institutions that are supposed to be nurturing young people , and this country that ’s supposed to be all youth - positive , there is just no support for young people .
It takes so little to catapult someone into another universe , but they do n’t even want to give you that .
I look at myself – anyone can say what they want about themselves , but when I was fifteen years old , I was n’t a fuckin special kid , I was like every fucking kid I knew .
And we all had dreams for ourselves , but the specificity of those dreams and the power of our longing made us feel exceptional .
But you know , on an objective level there was nothing special about me .
I keep thinking about almost every young person I ’ve met was a lot like me , and certainly not better , just how little it would take to send these kids places that the whole world needs , not just they need .
It just startles me .
Every time I reflect on my work , it ’s like okay , I did this , it was tough and shit , but the kind of support I got they ’re not even giving out anymore .
What sort of advice would you give writers who are just starting out ?
Can I expand the franchise a little more ?
I do n’t feel that my organic unit is ‘ the writer . ’
I feel my organic unit is poor immigrant kids who want to do something to make themselves feel valuable .
Maybe writing is a part of it , you want to feel valuable and fuckin productive .
The hardest thing in the world is to maintain any sense of hope in a country that does n’t give a fuck about you .
And whether it blows you up in Iraq , maybe it triples your student debt , while you ’ve got your back turned ?
The hardest thing in the world is to maintain a positive outlook , and I have failed many many times to stay positive , but you know what ?
That has been more to my detriment than anything else .
I ’ve never failed the way that I fail when I have gone negative .
And it ’s weird , even when shit is really tough , if you stay positive , it sounds really Pollyanna - ish , but it ’s a lot easier to get shit done and get out of that fucking hole .
But it ’s tough , man , when you ’ve got a boot on your neck , to say “ ohhh , gotta stay positive ! ”
I have a lot of respect for the kids I meet , and you know everybody says “ oooh this generation , it ’s going to hell , blah blah ” , and I ’m just like , “ Shut the fuck up , man . ”
An individual person thinks that they have enough knowledge and capacity that they can judge a collective ?
I ’m like , what ?
That ’s the ultimate height of absurd arrogance .
I ’m just like , yo , whatever , man .
Even if young people do n’t do anything , they ’re still worth it for the very fact that they ’re on this earth , you know .
Thank you so much for talking to us .
Thank you guys .
Just try to make me sound good , okay ?
We will make you sound awesome .
An unnamed source has claimed a New England Patriots employee secretly videotaped the St. Louis Rams ' pregame walk - through the day before Super Bowl XXXVI , the Boston Herald reported Saturday .
According to the report , an unnamed source close to the team during the 2001 season said that following the Patriots ' walk - through at the Louisiana Superdome , a member of the team 's video staff stayed behind and taped the Rams ' walk - through
-- a non-contact , no -pads practice at reduced speed in which a team goes through its plays .
The cameraman was not asked to identify himself or produce a press pass and later rode the media shuttle back to the Patriots ' hotel , the source told the Herald .
It is not known what became of the tape , or whether the cameraman made the tape on his own initiative or at someone else 's instruction , according to the report .
Mike Martz , who was St. Louis ' head coach during the Super Bowl game in question , spoke to ESPN.com investigative reporter Mike Fish about the allegations .
" I hope that is not true , " Martz said .
" I have great respect for [ Patriots head coach ] Bill Belichick .
It 's hard to believe that is true .
It 's a serious allegation and I hope it is not true .
" Obviously if there is enough substance to it the league should look into it . ''
In responding to the report , Patriots media relations official Stacey James said , " The coaches have no knowledge of it , " according to the Herald .
The next day , the Patriots upset the favored Rams 20 - 17 for their first Super Bowl championship .
New England will play the New York Giants in Super Bowl XLII on Sunday in a bid to become the first NFL team to finish a season 19-0 .
Former Rams quarterback Kurt Warner , currently with the Arizona Cardinals , told Fish that if the league has heard those claims , he is surprised it has not spoken to former Patriots video department employee Matt Walsh .
He said if Walsh or any other source has information , it should be investigated .
Walsh , a former Patriots video assistant , has suggested to ESPN.com that he has information that could have exposed the Patriots prior to the NFL catching New England taping the New York Jets ' defensive signals during the 2007 season opener .
The Patriots were fined $ 750,000 and lost a first - round draft pick as punishment .
" If I had a reason to want to go public , or tell a story , I could have done it before it even broke , " Walsh told ESPN.com .
" I could have said everything rather than having [ Jets coach Eric ] Mangini be the one to bring it out .
" If they 're doing a thorough investigation -- they did n't contact me .
So draw your own conclusions .
Maybe they felt they did n't need to .
Maybe the league feels they got satisfactory answers from everything the Patriots sent them . "
Told of the newest allegation , NFL spokesman Greg Aiello told
The Associated Press on Saturday :
" We were aware of the rumor months ago and looked into it .
There was no evidence of it on the tapes or in the notes produced
by the Patriots , and the Patriots told us it was not true . "
James reiterated that sentiment .
" The suggestion that the New England Patriots recorded the St .
Louis Rams ' walk - through on the day before Super Bowl XXXVI is
absolutely false , " James said .
" Any suggestion to the contrary is untrue . "
Rams spokesman Rick Smith , reading a statement from team
president John
Shaw , said , " At this point , we have no comment . "
Walsh , 31 , now an assistant golf pro at the Ka'anapli Golf Resort in Lahaina , Hawaii , worked for the Patriots from 1996 until the winter of 2002 - 03 , when he was fired .
He has hinted to ESPN.com that he has information that could be damaging to both the league and the Patriots but has declined to make it available , saying it could be seen as stolen property .
Walsh said he is fearful of potential legal action against him by either the league or the Patriots if he details what he knows .
He refused to provide evidence of potential wrongdoing unless ESPN agreed to pay his legal fees related to his involvement in the story , as well as to an indemnity that would cover any damages found against him in court .
ESPN denied his requests .
On Friday , Sen. Arlen Specter , R - Pa. , said he had written NFL commissioner Roger Goodell seeking an explanation as to why evidence in the NFL 's investigation of the Patriots videotaping was destroyed .
" I am very concerned about the underlying facts on the taping ,
the reasons for the judgment on the limited penalties and , most of
all , on the inexplicable destruction of the tapes , " Specter wrote .
Specter , the ranking Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee ,
said the matter could put the league 's antitrust exemption at risk .
In a phone interview with The New York Times , which first reported Specter 's interest in the matter , he said the committee at some point will call Goodell to address the antitrust exemption as well as the destruction of the tapes .
Goodell , in his previously scheduled news conference Friday from Phoenix , said , " I am more than willing to speak with the senator .
There are very good explanations why the tapes were destroyed by our staff -- there was no purpose for them . "
There were six tapes , according to Goodell -- some from the 2007 preseason and the rest from 2006 .
He said he had them destroyed because he was confident the Patriots had turned over all of the tapes and notes the NFL had requested in its investigation .
He also said they were destroyed in order to prevent leaks to the media -- as some footage from one of the tapes was leaked shortly after the story broke .
" We wanted to take and destroy that information , " Goodell said .
" They may have collected it within the rules , but we could n't determine that .
So we felt that it should be destroyed . "
Belichick had little to add on the subject .
" It 's a league matter , " he said Friday during his news conference .
" I do n't know
anything about it . "

“ Yes , it was a good war , ” writes Richard Cohen in his column challenging the thesis of pacifist Nicholson Baker in his new book , Human Smoke , that World War II produced more evil than good .
Baker ’s compelling work , which uses press clips and quotes of Axis and Allied leaders as they plunged into the great cataclysm , is a virtual diary of the days leading up to World War II .
Riveting to this writer was that Baker uses some of the same episodes , sources and quotes as this author in my own book out in May , Churchill , Hitler and ‘ The Unnecessary War . ’
On some points , Cohen is on sold ground .
There are things worth fighting for : God and country , family and freedom .
Martyrs have ever inspired men .
And to some evils pacifism is no answer .
Resistance , even unto death , may be required of a man .
But when one declares a war that produced Hiroshima and the Holocaust a “ Good War , ” it raises a question : good for whom ?
Britain declared war on Sept. 3 , 1939 , to preserve Poland .
For six years , Poland was occupied by Nazi and Soviet armies and SS and NKVD killers .
At war ’s end , the Polish dead were estimated at 6 million .
A third of Poland had been torn away by Stalin , and Nazis had used the country for the infamous camps of Treblinka and Auschwitz .
Fifteen thousand Polish officers had been massacred at places like Katyn .
The Home Army that rose in Warsaw at the urging of the Red Army in 1944 had been annihilated , as the Red Army watched from the other side of the Vistula .
When the British celebrated V - E day in May 1945 , Poland began 44 years of tyranny under the satraps of Stalin , Khrushchev and Brezhnev .
Was World War II “ a good war ” for the Poles ?
Was it a good war for Lithuania , Latvia and Estonia , overrun by Stalin ’s army in June 1940 , whose people saw their leaders murdered or deported to the Gulag never to return ?
Was it a good war for the Finns who lost Karelia and thousands of brave men dead in the Winter War ?
Was it a good war for Hungarians , Czechs , Yugoslavs , Rumanians and Albanians who ended up behind the Iron Curtain ?
In Hungary , it was hard to find a women or girl over 10 who had not been raped by the “ liberators ” of the Red Army .
Was it a good war for the 13 million German civilians ethnically cleansed from Central Europe and the 2 million who died in the exodus ?
Was it a good war for the French , who surrendered after six weeks of fighting in 1940 and had to be liberated by the Americans and British after four years of Vichy collaboration ?
And how good a war was it for the British ?
They went to war for Poland , but Winston Churchill abandoned Poland to Stalin .
Defeated in Norway , France , Greece , Crete and the western desert , they endured until America came in and joined in the liberation of Western Europe .
Yet , at war ’s end in 1945 , Britain was bled and bankrupt , and the great cause of Churchill ’s life , preserving his beloved empire , was lost .
Because of the “ Good War ” Britain would never be great again .
And were the means used by the Allies , the terror bombing of Japanese and German cities , killing hundreds of thousands of women and children , perhaps millions , the marks of a “ good war ” ?
Cohen contends that the evil of the Holocaust makes it a “ good war . ”
But the destruction of the Jews of Europe was a consequence of this war , not a cause .
As for the Japanese atrocities like the Rape of Nanking , they were indeed horrific .
But America ’s smashing of Japan led not to freedom for China , but four years of civil war followed by 30 years of Maoist madness in which 30 million Chinese perished .
For America , the war was Pearl Harbor and Midway , Anzio and Iwo Jima , Normandy and Bastogne , days of glory leading to triumph and the American Century .
But for Joseph Stalin , it was also a good war .
From his pact with Adolf Hitler he annexed parts of Finland and Rumania , and three Baltic republics .
His armies stood in Berlin , Prague and Vienna ; his agents were vying for power in Rome and Paris ; his ally was installed in North Korea ; his protg , Mao , was about to bring China into his empire .
But it was not so good a war for the inmates of Kolyma or the Russian POWs returned to Stalin in Truman ’s Operation Keelhaul .
Is a war that replaces Hitler ’s domination of Europe with Stalin ’s and Japan ’s rule in China with Mao ’s a “ good war ” ?
We had to stop the killers , says Cohen .
But who were the greater killers : Hitler or Stalin , Tojo or Mao Zedong ?
Can a war in which 50 million perished and the Christian continent was destroyed , half of it enslaved , a war that has advanced the death of Western civilization , be truly celebrated as a “ good war ” ?

Today 's Treasury yield curve :
And Paul Krugman sends us to the TED spread -- the risk and liqudiity premium big banks are demanding over Treasuries for the loans they make to each other .
Think of the TED spread as an indicator of financial fever -- with something like 0.3 % per year being normal .
Think of the short end of the yield curve as an indicator of how powerful the Federal Reserve 's standard medicine of swapping Treasury securities for bank reserves is .

UPDATED AND EDITED : The Navy has shot down a dying spy satellite .
Now the question is : what happens to the debris ?
The folks over at Analytical Graphics and Applied
Defense Solutions have put together a statistical simulation of one likely scenario .
Analytical Graphics ( AGI ) works up these sorts of sims all the time , for scientific - and defense - oriented space programs .
The trajectory for John Hopkins ' exploration of Pluto was plotted with AGI 's help , for example .
" Every branch of the military " uses their software , AGI 's Timothy Carrico says .
The Air Force 's 22nd Space Operations Squadron uses their products to help crunch collision - avoidance data for more than 80 satellites , according to Peter J. Brown at Via Satellite magazine .
And Applied Defense Solutions used AGI software to create a more accurate orbit determination system for the Naval Satellite Operations Center .
What makes the sims special is the injection of real - world physics .
Unlike the zippy little animations you 'll see on the evening news , every piece of debris in this satellite shoot - down model has been given its own mass , area , speed , velocity and drag .
Not every element of this particular model is hyper - realistic , however .
AGI put together a sim based on the Pentagon 's assertion that 50 percent of the debris would burn up in the atmosphere during the first two passes .
The model was set up also for the north Pacific , generally – not for the specific no - fly zone that the Navy has now carved out .
[ UPDATE : A new video , featured above , now has the missile launching from the proper place . ]
The mass and area of the debris is uniformly distributed ( although changes in velocity and direction are more natural ) .
Still , this is about as realistic a simulation you 're going to see .
For now .

Experts unsure what caused ' chaos ' on Air Canada Flight 190 Mike Aivaz and Adam Doster
Published : Friday January 11 , 2008
del.icio.us |
Print This Email This Without warning or reports of turbulence , an Air Canada flight en route to Toronto dipped and rotated violently , on early Thursday morning , causing injuries and confusion among passengers and the crew .
Strangely enough , flight experts are still unsure about what caused the accident .
" What happened aboard Air Canada flight 190 , " said a reporter on CBC's The National , " can best be described as chaos . "
According to passenger accounts , the Airbus aircraft bucked and rolled side to side abruptly , hurling dishes and people through the air .
" It was weird , " one passenger told the CBC .
" The plane actually turned upside down without actually feeling it .
There were people on the roof .
Coffe and shit [ was ] flying all over the plane . "
After steadying the plane , the pilots were able to make an emergency landing in Calgary under their own power .
Ten of the 88 people aboard were injured , even though the episode was over in 15 seconds .
All have since been released from the hospital .
So what caused the jolt ?
Immediately following the event , the pilot announced that the plane 's autopilot program had been knocked out .
But others are n't convinced .
" I do n't think it could have been anything other than turbulence , " a Canadian corporate pilot told the CBC .
" It 's highly unlikely that it could have been a mechanical problem . "
Air Canada says that the Transportation Safety Board Read the whole story is investigating , but turbulence seems plausible .
In the upper atmosphere , where many commercial jet liners like Flight 190 cruise , conditions exist where pilots cannot predict wind patterns that can lead to turbulence .

Glimpses of a new ( mathematical ) world A new mathematical object was revealed today during a lecture at the American Institute of Mathematics ( AIM ) .
Two researchers from the University of Bristol exhibited the first example of a third degree transcendental L - function .
These L- functions encode deep underlying connections between many different areas of mathematics .
The news caused excitement at the AIM workshop attended by 25 of the world 's leading analytic number theorists .
The work is a joint project between Ce Bian and his adviser , Andrew Booker .
Booker commented that , " This work was made possible by a combination of theoretical advances and the power of modern computers . "
During his lecture , Bian reported that it took approximately 10,000 hours of computer time to produce his initial results .
" This breakthrough opens a door to the study of higher degree L- functions , " said Dennis Hejhal , Professor of Mathematics at the University of Minnesota and Uppsala University .
" It 's a big advance " added Harold Stark of the University of California , San Diego , who , 30 years ago was the first to accurately calculate second degree transcendental L - functions .
" I thought we were years away from doing this .
The geometry of what you have to do and the scale of the computation are orders of magnitude harder . "
There are two types of L - functions : algebraic and transcendental , and these are classified according to their degree .
The Riemann zeta-function is the grand - daddy of all L - functions .
It holds the secret to how the prime numbers are distributed , and is a first degree algebraic L - function .
The Riemann Hypothesis , announced in 1859 and today the most important of all unsolved math problems , is an example of something that should be true for EVERY L - function .
Michael Rubinstein from the University of Waterloo , a participant at the workshop , quickly tested and confirmed the Riemann Hypothesis for the first few zeroes of this newly minted L - function .
Rubinstein , along with William Stein of the University of Washington , will direct a new initiative to systematically chart L- functions ; this project has been recommended for funding by the National Science Foundation .
" The techniques developed by Bian and Booker open up whole new possibilities for experimenting with these powerful and mysterious functions and are a key step towards making our group project a success . "
Rubinstein added .
" It 's a big step toward our understanding the ' world of L , ' which is where most of the secrets of number theory are kept . " said Brian Conrey , Director of AIM .
Dorian Goldfeld , Professor of Mathematics at Columbia University summarized the excitement , saying `` This discovery is analogous to finding planets in remote solar systems .
We know they are out there , but the problem is to detect them and determine what they look like .
It gives us a glimpse of new worlds . "
Comparisons can be a pain in the backside .
My dad says that nobody was ever better than Tom Finney or Puskas , my older brother says George Best and Pele have no equals , I believe Maradona to be the best ever and my son says that Cristiano Ronaldo has more than the lot of them put together .
It has always been this way .
We always think that the top players of ‘ our generation ’ are the best of all time .
It is impossible to compare these great players because they are all from a different place and time .
Of course George Best would n’t be as quick , as fit or strong enough to play in today ’s Premiership and Ronaldo would have been even more of a phenomenon than he is now if you transported him back thirty or forty years .
You can only judge them by how good they were amongst their contemporaries .
It is no good listening to anecdotal evidence because the fans of each player will only tell you why their particular favourite is the best of all time .
The only way to judge this fairly is to look at the facts and figures .

So there we have the stats .
What do we make of them ?
If you need some more help let ’s look at what other people think of them and in some cases , what they think of themselves .
“ Comparing Paul Gascoigne to Pele is like comparing Rolf Harris to Rembrandt ” — Rodney Marsh .
“ For 20 years they have been asking me the same question , who is the greatest ?
Maradona or Pele ?
I reply that all you have to do is look at the facts – how many goals did he score with his right foot or with his head ? ” – Pele
“ George Best was able to use either foot .
Sometimes he seemed to have six of them ” – Sir Matt Busby
“ Maradona good , Pele better , George Best ” – Famous Irish saying
“ I worked hard all my life for this .
Those who say I do n’t deserve anything , that it all came easy , can kiss my arse . ” — Maradona
“ Maradona is our maximum term of reference .
No one embodies our essence better .
No one bears our emblem more nobly .
To no other , in the last twenty years , have we offered up so much passion .
Argentina is Maradona , Maradona is Argentina . ” – Argentinian psychologist
“ Everyone went crazy over Wayne Rooney , but I get more excited by Cristiano Ronaldo . ” - George Best
“ There have been a few players described as the new George Best over the years , but this is the first time it ’s been a compliment to me . ” - George Best on Cristiano Ronaldo
So there we have it .
It ’s decision time .
Does Cristiano Ronaldo deserve to be in this company yet ?
Could any of the other three score the goal that Ronaldo scored against Roma last night ?
Pele maybe .
So if these are the greatest ever , what order do they go in ?
I ’ll go first and give my reasons :
1. Pele – a ) 3 World Cup winners medals b) Scoring record c ) Apart from Viagra , no drugs as far as we know d)
He says he was better than Maradona
2. Diego Maradona – a )
Won a World Cup almost single - handedly b) Talent and attitude , i.e. Kiss my arse c ) Just too many drugs
3. Cristiano Ronaldo – a ) Already performed at European and World Cups b) George Best said he is better than he was c )
Has n’t quite got the longevity yet
4. George Best – a )
Wonderful player but Ronaldo has beaten his record b)
Not his fault to be born in Northern Ireland but no major International success c )
Too much booze .
Over to you .

A Chinese builder buried alive for two hours used Buddhist meditation techniques to control his breathing and survive on just the air trapped in his safety helmet .
Wang Jianxin , 52 , should have died within five minutes of being entombed 6ft underground as he worked in a ditch in Ningbo city , eastern China .
But by slowing his breathing he eked out an air pocket in front of his face until rescuers dug him out .
Scroll down for more ...
Trapped : Wang Jianxin is freed after two hours buried alive .
He used meditation to breathe
Mr Wang said : " I knew the air would n't last , so I made myself relax and concentrated on my breathing by meditation .
" It was very still and quiet down there .
I was surprised at how easy it was to focus my mind and achieve inner calm , even though I believed I was facing death .
" Later , it became very hot and suffocating .
I thought I might not make it back to the surface .
Then I heard the sounds of voices and digging , and suddenly I could see again .
It was the longest two hours of my life . "
A doctor at the scene in Ningbo , eastern China , said : " It 's a miracle . "
Mr Wang was digging a 15 ft ditch at a building site when a wall of earth collapsed , burying him alive .
He said : " I had my back to the wall .
I did n't know it was falling until it was on top of me . "
Workmates and 11 firefighters dug Mr Wang out .
One said : " As we went deeper , we used our hands to dig as we feared our shovels might injure him .
Then we had to hold the soil back with fencing . "
It took two hours but finally they pulled out Mr Wang alive from the earth that could have been his muddy grave .
Meditation has a history dating back thousands of years in China .
However , it is a technique more usually associated with Buddhist monks and doctors of traditional Chinese medicine than construction workers .
Mr Wang was one of the lucky ones on China 's building sites .
The country has a woeful record of safety in the workplace with 101,480 people killed last year in work - related or road accidents , down by about 10 per cent from 2006 .
But a glance at any urban building site highlights the sporadic nature of safety measures used by many Chinese companies .
Most workers are given helmets , but in many cases that is the most that employers are willing to provide .
Many of these men are rural migrants who have left their remote patch of farmland in search of better - paying city jobs .
With almost no education and scant notion of safety regulations , they eagerly seize the opportunity of a job and are usually too afraid or too ignorant to demand better equipment from their boss .
( CNN ) -- Sen. Barack Obama claimed a significant victory in the South Carolina Democratic primary on Saturday , telling supporters " we are hungry for change . "
The Illinois senator earned more than twice the vote that rival Sen. Hillary Clinton did , 55 percent to 27 percent , unofficial returns showed .
Former Sen. John Edwards was third with 18 percent .
" Tonight , the cynics who believed that what began in the snows of Iowa was just an illusion were told a different story by the good people of South Carolina , " Obama said to supporters Saturday .
Watch a recap of Obama 's big win »
A win in South Carolina was considered crucial for Obama , who won Iowa but finished second to Clinton in New Hampshire and Nevada .
See what the results mean »
" I did not travel around this state over the last year and see a white South Carolina or a black South Carolina .
I saw South Carolina , " he said .
" The choice in this election is not between regions or religions or genders , " Obama said .
" It 's not about rich versus poor ; young versus old ; and it is not about black versus white .
" It 's about the past versus the future . "
Watch Obama speech
With 99 percent of precincts reporting , Obama had 55 percent of the vote .
Clinton was second with 27 percent , followed by Edwards , with 18 percent .
Obama 's victory capped a heated contest in South Carolina , the first Democratic primary in the South and the first with a largely African - American electorate .
Obama , who is hoping to become the the nation 's first African - American president , did well with black voters , who made up about half of Saturday 's electorate , according to exit polls .
Black voters supported the Illinois senator by a margin of more than 4 - to - 1 over his nearest rival , exit polls indicate .
Among white voters , Obama took about a quarter of the vote , with Clinton and Edwards roughly splitting the remainder , according to exit polls .
Clinton congratulated Obama and said she was excited to move forward to the Super Tuesday contests on February 5 .
" Millions and millions of Americans are going to have the chance to have their voices heard and their votes counted , " she told supporters at Tennessee State University .
Watch Clinton speak to supporters »
Edwards also looked ahead to the next contests .
" Now the three of us move on to February 5 , where millions of Americans will cast their vote and help shape the future of this party and help shape the future of America , " he said .
Watch Edwards rally supporters »
" Our campaign from the very beginning has been about one central thing , and that is to give voice to the millions of Americans who have absolutely no voice in this democracy . "
Clinton beat Obama only among elderly voters , according to exit polls .
Among voters 65 and older , Clinton beat Obama 40 to 32 percent .
But Obama handily defeated Clinton in every other bracket , and overall garnered 58 percent of the vote among 18 to 64 - year - olds while 23 percent of those voters picked Clinton .
And half of those polled said both candidates shared blame for the rancor between the two camps .
Of those who said one of the contenders was more to blame than the other , 21 percent blamed Clinton , and 6 percent said Obama .
" It 's fairly obvious it 's not going to be over February 5 , " Obama spokesman Robert Gibbs said .
Edwards was born in South Carolina and won the state 's primary four years ago , when he was making his first bid for the White House .

Edwards had touted his native status , and as the Clinton and Obama camps have squabbled , Edwards continued to talk about the issues and suggests he 's the only adult in the field .
Watch Edwards reach out to voters »
" I'm keeping moving no matter what , but I feel good about how things are moving right now here today , " Edwards told reporters Saturday morning .
" I feel there 's a lot of energy behind my campaign . "
On January 15 , Edwards pledged , " I 'm in this for the long haul .
We 're continuing to accumulate delegates .
There 's actually a very narrow margin between Sen.
Obama , Sen. Clinton and myself on delegates . "
The state Democratic party estimated that more than 530,000 Democrats turned out for Saturday 's primary , as compared with 445,000 voters who showed up to vote last weekend in the state 's Republican primary .
The Democratic numbers topped the GOP turnout for the first time since 1992 , when 445,000 Republicans turned out to renominate President George H.W. Bush .
Obama attracted more than 290,000 votes -- nearly matching the total turnout of the 2004 Democratic primary .
" This is an enormous turnout , " CNN analyst Jeffrey Toobin said .
" Democrats are wildly motivated in this election . "
As South Carolina 's Democratic primary voters went to the polls Saturday , almost half of them had made up their minds more than a month ago , according to exit polls .
In the 2004 primary , nearly a quarter decided either the day of the primary or in the three days prior who they would support , but this year , only 10 percent of this year 's voters waited until Saturday to choose .
Another 10 percent decided only in the last three days , and 32 percent decided in the last month .
Forty - seven percent made up their minds at least a month ago , more than double the percentage of 2004 .
The early exit polls were taken from a sampling of 1,269 voters statewide .
Following a rough campaign between Clinton and Obama , the two camps toned down the rhetoric in the past two days , returning to the issues and concentrating their firepower on the Republicans rather than on each other .
" I think they [ the Republicans ] should be gracious and just say , " We have messed this thing up so much we are just going to quit and ... we should n't be re-elected , ' but I do n't think that is what they are going to do , " Clinton said .
South Carolina is the last big test for the Democrats before Super Tuesday , February 5 , when nearly two dozen states will hold either primaries or caucuses -- including such delegate - rich states as California , New York , New Jersey and Illinois .
Florida holds its primary on Tuesday but no Democratic delegates are being awarded there because the national party is penalizing the state for moving its primary up earlier in the year .

HEALTHCARE CAGE MATCH ….
Canada ’s healthcare system has both good and bad points , but overall it does about as serviceable a job as America ’s healthcare system .
And it does it for a whole lot less money .
But there ’s more !
As this EPI snapshot shows , Canada ’s universal healthcare system also controls the growth of healthcare costs better than our jury - rigged quasi- private - public - mishmash of a system .
Since 1993 , the per capita cost of healthcare in Canada has increased 67 % .
That ’s a lot .
But it ’s nothing compared to U.S. healthcare costs , which started out higher but even so skyrocketed a stunning 92 % .
Kinda makes you think we could learn a thing or two , does n’t it ?
After releasing Python 3.0a1 with a mutable bytes type , pressure mounted to add a way to represent immutable bytes .
Gregory P. Smith proposed a patch that would allow making a bytes object temporarily immutable by requesting that the data be locked using the new buffer API from PEP 3118 .
This did not seem the right approach to me .
Jeffrey Yasskin , with the help of Adam Hupp , then prepared a patch to make the bytes type immutable ( by crudely removing all mutating APIs ) and fix the fall - out in the test suite .
This showed that there are n't all that many places that depend on the mutability of bytes , with the exception of code that builds up a return value from small pieces .
Thinking through the consequences , and noticing that using the array module as an ersatz mutable bytes type is far from ideal , and recalling a proposal put forward earlier by Talin , I floated the suggestion to have both a mutable and an immutable bytes type .
( This had been brought up before , but until seeing the evidence of Jeffrey 's patch I was n't open to the suggestion . )
Moreover , a possible implementation strategy became clear : use the old PyString implementation , stripped down to remove locale support and implicit conversions to / from Unicode , for the immutable bytes type , and keep the new PyBytes implementation as the mutable bytes type .
The ensuing discussion made it clear that the idea is welcome but needs to be specified more precisely .
Hence this PEP .
If you are downloading stuff you would n't have bought in the first place , according to economist Karen Croxson , you are probably doing the company that created the product a big favor .
You , Mr ' Good ' Pirate , are telling your friends , adding to the media ' buzz ' and driving up sales .
Imagine a situation in the future where Internet pirates are accepted – maybe even recruited – to replace expensive marketing and consumer awareness teams when bringing a product to market .
Imagine the reward for the pirate was a free copy of the software / media he agrees to promote .
According to an economist , it could be happening right now .
In her talk at the Annual Conference of the Royal Economic Society , Oxford economist Karen Croxson says that when people copy software , music and movies , it may actually help the producer .
“ Digital piracy has been claimed to endanger whole industries ” said Ms Croxson .
“ A natural question to ask is :
Why do some companies develop water - tight technology to safeguard their intellectual property when others appear more relaxed about copying ? ”
Many pirates say that they would never have bought much of the stuff they downloaded or copied .
If you fall into this category , you might be a ‘ good ’ or ‘ promotional ’ pirate .
Croxson says that piracy is only a threat to sales when people who originally intended to buy , did n’t , and pirated instead .
The others – of which there a many , many millions – never intended to buy and these , says Croxson , cannot possibly harm the seller .
Far from the “ all pirates are evil ” cry , these pirates tell their friends , and they tell their friends and so the priceless product ‘ buzz ’ is generated .
This consumer ‘ buzz ’ is difficult to put a price on , but needless to say it ’s very valuable indeed .
Even if companies ‘ paid ’ a pirate with a free copy of their product in exchange for him spreading the word about the product , it ’s still a fantastic deal – especially if these ‘ promotional ’ pirates were n’t going to buy the product in the first instance .
Also considered by Croxson are the reasons why people are tempted to copy something , which include value put on time , concerns about being caught and moral issues .
Using these and other factors enables Croxson to discover piracy ’s true threat to sales of a product and suggest the best responses .
Due to computer games being most popular in the youth market , they are heavily protected .
Although young people place a lot of value on games , they have fewer fears when it comes to copying and have more time than most to do so .
It ’s suggested that this could be ‘ bad ’ piracy , in that these activities negatively affect sales , without the ‘ promotional ’ benefits .
On the other hand , business software companies put a lot less effort into anti-piracy measures .
It ’s suggested that people who use software in the course of their business place higher value on it , have less time to pirate and worry more about the legal aspects , so are less likely to pirate .
Croxson said : ‘ With valuable users shying away from copying , the sellers in the business software market find themselves more naturally insulated against lost sales .
Those more inclined to pirate , perhaps students , probably would n’t have bought the product anyway , so represent virtually free promotion .
This helps explain why business software companies do not put as many resources into protection as computer games manufacturers . ”
“ Building a theoretical model of `promotional piracy ’ , ” says Croxson , “ it is possible to distinguish markets that are best advised to put considerable resource into safeguarding their products from others which may live quite comfortably with a higher incidence of digital piracy . ”
The smear machine is taking out after Barack Obama , and with a vengeance .
Not that this is surprising , or even anything new : they ’ve been conducting a low - level hate campaign ever since he attained front - runner status , and now they ’re going into overdrive with a commentary by Ron Kessler in the Wall Street Journal that uses the same guilt - by - association technique that they used against Ron Paul .
With Paul , it was tarring him with the brush of " white nationalism , " even though any sort of nationalism  white , black , pink , or purple  is anathema to libertarians of Paul ’s ilk .
That did n’t stop the character assassins , however  including those Beltway " libertarians " who have imbibed the political correctness that is de rigueur on the Washington cocktail - party circuit .
Newsletters written during the 1980s , excoriating race rioters and opining that they reflected the welfare - state mentality that pervaded our politics at the time , were condemned by these worthies because to even address the culture of entitlement in the black community is supposedly prima facie evidence of " racism . "
A campaign contribution from an obscure racist was blown up as proof positive that Paul is hoping for the revival of the Third Reich , although no one can be held responsible for who contributes to their campaign , and certainly the money 
$ 500  was to be used to achieve political objectives that are n’t even remotely connected to racism or bigotry of any sort .
In the case of Obama , the assault is taking the form of an attack on the Rev. Jeremiah Wright , the now - retired pastor of Obama ’s church whom Obama describes as a religious " mentor " in his autobiography The Audacity of Hope .
Again , the basic strategy is to make Obama answer for each and every one of Wright ’s pronouncements , no matter how wacky or lame - brained , such as the contention that AIDS was created by the U.S. government .
Aside from the logical fallacy inherent in the guilt - by - association tact  after all , Obama did n’t say AIDS was a U.S. government plot , Wright did  implicit in all this is the assumption that all blacks believe the same thing , that they are a collective entity linked by some sort of ethnic consciousness , and , therefore , Obama can and must be held responsible for Wright ’s opinions on every subject under the sun , including those he had no knowledge of .
So , what , aside from the AIDS comment , did Wright say that was so terrible ?
The War Street Journal piece simply quotes these , without offering much of an argument for their iniquitous nature .
Here ’s Wright on racism and foreign policy :
" We ’ve got more black men in prison than there are in college .
Racism is alive and well .
Racism is how this country was founded and how this country is still run .
No black man will ever be considered for president , no matter how hard you run , Jesse [ Jackson ] , and no black woman can ever be considered for anything outside what she can give with her body . "
Of course , Wright ’s contention that " no black man will ever be considered for president " is refuted by the very fact of Obama ’s front - runner status .
Perhaps only Hillary Clinton  who recently offered Obama the vice presidency , in spite of the fact that he ’s ahead of her by every measure  and a few yahoos out in the sticks are stuck in this old mindset .
As for the rest , it ’s undeniably true .
We do have more black men in prison than in college  way more .
Racism is alive and well ; driving while black is still a dangerous pastime .
This country was founded with a near - fatal flaw in the constitutional order , one that permitted slavery to continue for another hundred years .
While I do n’t agree with everything Wright says in this statement , I do n’t see anything that is n’t part of the broad spectrum of popular opinion in this country , though a lot of what he says may be considered out of bounds for the elites .
Kessler , however , is convinced that it is only necessary to repeat what Wright has said : no explanation is really required .
In the same vein , he continues citing Wright :
" Mr. Wright thundered on : ‘ America is still the No. 1 killer in the world .
We are deeply involved in the importing of drugs , the exporting of guns , and the training of professional killers .
We bombed Cambodia , Iraq , and Nicaragua , killing women and children while trying to get public opinion turned against Castro and Ghadhafi .
We put [ Nelson ] Mandela in prison and supported apartheid the whole 27 years he was there .
We believe in white supremacy and black inferiority and believe it more than we believe in God . ’
But of course the American government is the number - one killer in the world : we pride ourselves on it .
Why else would our " defense " budget exceed the military expenditures of all other nations combined ?
We glory in our ability to kill , and we do n’t hesitate to exercise our talents .
In Iraq alone , the U.S. invasion has led to as many as a million deaths .
The racial aspect of all this is dramatized , in rather vivid terms , by the Pentagon ’s refusal to count Iraqi deaths .
Only American casualties are reported , because only Americans matter , as John McCain avers in his rationalization of the war and continued occupation :
" We ’ve been in Japan for 60 years , we ’ve been in South Korea for 50 years or so .
That ’d be fine with me as long as Americans are not being injured or harmed or wounded or killed .
That ’s fine with me . "
As long as it ’s mainly Iraqis being killed , then that ’s just fine with McCain .
Another war he supported , and continues to valorize , killed , maimed , and traumatized millions of Vietnamese , but the " gooks "  as McCain unapologetically put it  do n’t count , either .
It was American , not Vietnamese , casualties that triggered our retreat from Southeast Asia .
In the Philippines , too , where water - boarding was a routine method of interrogation , we slaughtered thousands , justifying our savagery with the " progressive " ( at the time ) rhetoric of moral and cultural uplift , the 19th - century equivalent of " it takes a village . "
Teddy Roosevelt , McCain ’s idol , preached this doctrine and was lionized by the liberals of his era as a great innovator and a heroic figure .
Racism is closely linked to imperialism , and it does n’t take a genius to understand why .
Since , by definition , a policy of conquest means conquering foreigners , and these peoples are often , albeit not always , of another race , it behooves the conqueror to rationalize his aggression in racial terms .
" Take up the white man ’s burden "  up until very recently , Kipling ’s poetic phrase has been the leitmotif and battle cry of the global Anglo hegemon .
It was , and is , a world order founded on racism , mercantilism , and militarism , the three pillars of hegemonist thought .
Yet the Wall Street Journal has its own version of history and is certainly no critic of mercantilism , either historic or contemporary .
In any case , the Journal ‘s real beef with Wright is n’t mentioned until midway through Kessler ’s piece :
" His voice rising , Mr. Wright said , ‘ We supported Zionism shamelessly while ignoring the Palestinians and branding anybody who spoke out against it as being anti-Semitic .
We care nothing about human life if the end justifies the means . ’"
One wonders on what grounds Kessler or the Journal would dispute Wright ’s contention ; alas , we can only speculate , since no argument is even attempted .
The evil of Wright ’s remarks is apparently self - evident  except it is n’t .
We have supported Israel unconditionally , in spite of Israel ’s defiance on the settlements issue and its continued occupation of conquered territory that imposes what former President Jimmy Carter rightly likens to a system of apartheid .
Worse , we have encouraged Israeli aggression , cheering on and actively aiding the invasion of Lebanon and conflating Israel ’s right of " self - defense " with a policy of expansionism .
As for branding critics of Israel as anti-Semites , is Kessler really maintaining that this never happens ?
It ’s the smear - of - first - resort of the Israel - first lobby , as professors John J. Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt have recently discovered .
Everyone knows that to traduce this terrain is to walk through a political minefield , which is why most American politicians scrupulously avoid it  a testament , by the way , to the trenchancy of the Mearsheimer - Walt thesis that the Israel lobby wields an inordinate and ultimately unhealthy influence over the conduct of American foreign policy .
There was a similar brouhaha from those quarters when Obama opined that " nobody is suffering more than the Palestinian people . "
The Lobby ’s antennae quivered  does n’t he know who holds the official monopoly on suffering ?
 and they ’ve been on him ever since .
The rest of Kessler ’s piece is an extension of the guilt - by - association technique , in which a new factor is added to the Obama = Wright equation : Louis Farrakhan , leader of the Nation of Islam .
Wright ’s church magazine apparently gave Farrakhan some sort of award , so now the equation is Obama = Wright = Farrakhan .
This feeds directly into the widely circulated rumor that Obama , having imbibed Islam in Indonesia , is a secret Muslim  a jihadist at heart .
The smear campaign against Obama has just begun .
As he wins primary after primary , racking up delegates and leaving Hillary in the electoral dust , these gusts of slanderous invective will take on full gale force .
What we are witnessing is the first stage of a calculated attempt to characterize the putative Democratic nominee as a secret Muslim , a black nationalist , and a 3 a .m. threat to hearth and home .
The author of this piece , Kessler , is the head honcho over at Newsmax.com , a site that is the prototypical example of right - wing " movement " hackery .
During the Clinton years , it used to run stuff about Vince Foster and the alleged Clinton connection to his death .
Today they are shilling for the Clintons , carrying out the widely noted Clintonian scorched - earth strategy of making Obama unelectable , then biding their time until 2012 .
Talk about strange bedfellows  or , on second thought , not so strange .
Clearly , Obama is the candidate the neoconservatives fear and loathe : the loathing is on account of his antiwar views , at least when it comes to Iraq , and the fear stems from the fact that campaigning against him will be difficult .
Hillary they can handle : she ’ll mobilize the troops and weld together the fractured Republican coalition in opposition .
The War Party is in full battle mode , and it is determined to destroy Obama .
Will it succeed ?

Proof # 17 - Think about Leprechauns
Many believers will say , " It is impossible for you to prove that God ( Allah , Ra , Vishnu , whatever ) does not exist .
There is no way to prove that something does not exist . "
This is a silly argument for the following reason .
Imagine that we have a conversation one day and I say to you , " Today I believe in the gerflagenflopple .
You cannot prove that the gerflagenflopple does not exist , therefore it exists . "
You can see that this is ridiculous .
Just because I have invented something out of thin air does not mean that its non-existence is suddenly unprovable .
There has to be some evidence , or some reason , that the gerflagenflopple exists in order to assert its existence .
Since there is not , it is quite easy to say that the gerflagenflopple is imaginary until such evidence is provided .
We also know that the gerflagenflopple was made up on this web page .
The word did not exist until created here .
In this way , the gerflagenflopple is like Rudolf the Red Nose Reindeer : " Rudolph first appeared in a 1939 booklet written by Robert L. May and published by Montgomery Ward . "
We know Rudolf is fictional , and imaginary , because we can point to the fictional story that is his source .
Leprechauns
Now let 's imagine that we have a conversation one day and I say to you , " I believe in Leprechauns .
You cannot prove that Leprechauns do not exist , therefore they exist . "
You actually have heard of Leprechauns .
There are lots of books , movies and fairy tales dealing with Leprechauns .
People talk about Leprechauns all the time .
Leprechauns even have a popular brand of breakfast cereal .
A page like this describes / defines the traits of Leprechauns .
But that does not mean that Leprechauns exist .
If you read the folklore around Leprechauns , you realize that certain aspects are impossible .
For example , Leprechauns are defined to be beings who keep a crock of gold at the end of a rainbow .
But anyone who understands rainbows knows that there is not a geographic location associated with rainbows .
Rainbows are not physical objects , but instead are optical phenomena dependent on an observer .
Therefore rainbows do not have fixed X/Y locations for their ends on the ground .
This is the problem with the Leprechaun legend - Leprechauns have a property that is impossible , and therefore we can say that Leprechauns do not exist .
There is no " end " to any rainbow , and therefore no pots of gold located at such a point , and therefore no Leprechauns .
They are as imaginary as the gerflagenflopple .
Is there something that would prove Leprechauns to be real ?
First , we would need to change the definition of Leprechauns .
We would have to drop the " pot of gold at the end of the rainbow " part of the definition , because that part is impossible .
But if we do that , we are not talking about Leprechauns anymore .
This is another way to know that Leprechauns are imaginary .
Noah 's Ark Another imaginary thing that , like Leprechauns , we hear quite a bit about in our culture is the story of Noah and his Ark .
How do we know that the Noah 's Ark story is imaginary ?
First , the story contains an element that is impossible .
Genesis 7:20 says , " The waters rose and covered the mountains to a depth of more than fifteen cubits . "
This would mean that Mt. Everest , with a height of 29,000 feet ( 8,850 meters ) or nearly 6 miles , was covered in water .
It is impossible because that water does not exist .
A planet does not magically get covered in 6 miles of water , and then have the water magically disappear .
Second , there is no evidence that the event actually occurred .
And a planet - wide event of this proportion would necessarily leave incontrovertible evidence behind .
There would be geological evidence , archeological evidence , ice core evidence and so on .
Genesis 7:21 states : " Every living thing that moved on land perished � birds , livestock , wild animals , all the creatures that swarm over the earth , and all mankind . "
That would leave behind massive amounts of genetic evidence in every species , as each species narrowed to a single breeding pair .
For these reasons we can easily say that the story Noah 's Ark is imaginary - a fictional fairy tale .
God
If you think about it , you will realize that there is no difference between God and Leprechauns .
Lots of people talk about God as though he exists , but there is no actual evidence for God 's existence .
And there should be , because there are many positive claims in the definition of God .
For example : God has never left any physical evidence of his existence on earth .
All historical gods were imaginary and we know it .
( see this page )
None of Jesus ' " miracles " left any physical evidence either .
( see this page )
God has never spoken to modern man , for example by taking over all the television stations and broadcasting a rational message to everyone .
The resurrected Jesus has never appeared to anyone in a provable way .
( see this page )
The Bible we have is provably incorrect and is obviously the work of primitive men rather than God. ( see this page )
When we analyze prayer with statistics , we find no evidence that God is " answering prayers . " ( see this page )
Huge , amazing atrocities like the Holocaust and AIDS occur without any response from God .
And so on �
There is absolutely no evidence indicating that God exists .
There is a tremendous amount of empirical evidence that God does not exist .
For example , God is defined as a prayer - answering being , but we know with certainty that the belief in prayer is a superstition .
Therefore we can conclusively say that God is imaginary .
Another angle
Here is a second way to look at the same question .
With every other object and phenomenon in our experience , we use the scientific method to determine whether it exists or not .
For example , X rays are invisible , but we know that they exist .
We can devise scientific experiments to prove that they exist .
Then , once proven to exist , X - rays can be used predictably in all sorts of beneficial ways .
If you would like to hypothesize that God exists , then you should say to yourself , " Let 's devise a repeatable scientific experiment to provide evidence that God exists . "
Every experiment we devise demonstrates , yet again , that God is imaginary .
This page provides a simple example of such an experiment - if God were real , we should be able to have him to appear as described in the Bible .
Is n't it odd that God , unlike everything else in our universe , has been put into a special category ?
When we talk about God , we are supposed to do so " philosophically . "
Why ?
Why not treat God just like all other objects and devise experiments to detect his presence or absence ?
The classic religious response is , " God must remain hidden .
If he proved his existence , that would take away faith . "
This is clever -- here we have an object named God that proves its existence by completely hiding its existence .
Of course , in the real world , any object that provides no evidence for its existence is classified as imaginary .
Even more interesting , this object called God , which is supposedly hiding its existence completely , is in the meantime supposedly writing books , answering prayers and incarnating itself .
How can that be ?
This obvious contradiction shows how imaginary God is .
When we look at prayer scientifically , we find that " answered prayers " are actually nothing but coincidences .
When we look at the Bible scientifically , ethically or rationally , we find that the Bible is wrong .
When we look at all of Jesus ' miracles scientifically , we find that none of them left behind any scientific or historical evidence .
Nor , for that matter , did Jesus , nor did Jesus ' resurrection .
Strangely , not a single historical source independent of the Bible ever mentions the resurrection .
There is a famous saying : " Absence of evidence is not evidence of Absence . "
And that is true sometimes .
But in many cases the statement is not true .
As we saw with Noah 's Ark , the event would have necessarily left evidence behind in many different forms and places .
Therefor , the absence of evidence is evidence of absence in this case .
God suffers from the same type of problem .
God is defined , for example , as a prayer answering being .
We can easily demonstrate that the belief in prayer is a superstition .
That contradiction shows
God to be imaginary .
The reason why we can find no empirical evidence for God 's existence is not because " God is a magical being completely able to hide from us . "
It is because God is imaginary .

This is the first of eight stories in our Web feature on self - experimenters .
As Kevin Warwick gently squeezed his hand into a fist one day in 2002 , a robotic hand came to life 3,400 miles away and mimicked the gesture .
The University of Reading cybernetics professor had successfully wired the nerves of his forearm to a computer in New York City 's Columbia University and networked them to a robotic system back in his Reading , England , lab .
" My body was effectively extended over the Internet , " Warwick says .
It 's a far cry from his vision of transforming humanity into a race of half - machine cyborgs able to commune with the digital world — there is no spoon , Neo — but such an evolution is necessary , says 54 - year - old Warwick .
Those who do n't avail themselves of subcutaneous microchips and other implanted technology , he predicts , will be at a serious disadvantage in tomorrow 's world , because they wo n't be able to communicate with the " superintelligent machines " sure to be occupying the highest rungs of society , as he explains in a 2003 documentary , Building Gods , which is circulating online .
Something of a self - promoter , Warwick , or " Captain Cyborg " as a U.K. newspaper once dubbed him , has appeared on Late Night with Conan O'Brien and other shows on the TV talk circuit to tout his work .
In his 2004 book , I , Cyborg , he describes his research as " the extraordinary story of my adventure as the first human entering into a cyber world . "
More reserved in conversation , Warwick says he wants to advance brain–machine interfaces ( BMI ) beyond current studies in nonhuman primates , such as a recent experiment that synched up a pair of robot legs with a jogging , BMI - outfitted monkey .
He says the short - term benefits could be smarter prosthetics for amputees , infrared - based sensory systems for the blind and brain implants to treat Parkinson 's disease .
Daniela Cerqui , an anthropology professor at the University of Lausanne in Switzerland , who has followed Warwick 's work since 2004 , says she " met people very fascinated with what he was doing . "
She adds : " I also met engineers who did n't think what he was doing was real science . "
In 1998 Warwick was one of the first people to have a simple digital transmitter known as a radio - frequency identification device ( RFID ) implanted just below the skin in his upper left arm .
For nine glorious days doors parted and lights switched on for him in the University of Reading Department of Cybernetics as the RFID alerted different sensors to Warwick 's approach .
In 2002 he had electrodes implanted in the nerves of his left forearm ( prudent for a right - hander ) .
He used the implant to enslave the robot hand far away in Reading , an electric wheelchair and the lights in his lab as well as to communicate with his wife , Irena .
She had agreed to receive a similar implant to see if hus - borg and wife could exchange electrical signals .
" If she moved her hand , " Warwick says , " my nervous system received one pulse .
If she moved her hand three times , I received three pulses . "
He hopes to have a sensor implanted in his brain by 2015 that will allow him to send signals across a computer network .
Of course , a Brown University team has already moved the goalposts much closer :
In 2006 researchers reported that a 25 - year - old quadriplegic man had guided a computer cursor and moved a prosthetic arm via a brain implant .
Warwick may have trouble finding a doctor to implant a similar device without a compelling medical reason , points out Charles Higgins , an associate professor of electrical engineering and neurobiology at the University of Arizona in Tucson .
Sure , he might damage his brain , but for Warwick , it 's the lesser of two evils .
In his vision of a future dominated by cyborgs and intelligent machines , the outlook for those who refuse implants is grim : " I guess they 'll be some sort of subspecies .
Just like we have cows now , " he says , " so we 'll have humans in the future . "
And he 'd rather not be put out to pasture .
Last year , I spotted an interesting report about ways to treat insomnia without drugs .
I wrote about it and quickly learned how devastating an illness insomnia really is .
Hundreds of readers shared their stories of wretched nights awake and a medical community that offered no real answers .
Writer Gayle Greene ’s new book , “ Insomniac , ” from the University of California Press , is both memoir and investigation into the world of insomnia .
Here is an excerpt .
— Tara Parker - Pope
By Gayle Greene
The first thing to go is your sense of humor .
Then goes the desire to do the things you used to do , then the desire to do anything at all .
Parts of your body ache that you do n’t even know the names of , and your eyes forget how to focus .
Words you once knew are n’t there anymore , and there ’s less and less to say .
People you once cared about fall by the way and you let them go , too .
Insomnia is a problem most insomniacs do n’t want to talk about .
In fact , it ’s a problem many of us do n’t know how to talk about .
“ Oh , you know , a bad night , ’’ I say to a colleague ’s “ What ’s wrong ? ” on one of my walking - into - walls day .
“ Why , Gayle , what do you have to lose sleep about ?
You ’ve got no problems , ” says my colleague , eyebrows raised .
If I ’d been up with a bad tooth or a sick child , that ’s something he would understand .
If I just plain ca n’t sleep , that ’s weird .
Anyhow , chronic insomnia is not just ” a bad night . ”
Chronic insomnia is a bad night that goes on and on .
Look on the Web , read what insomniacs say on Sleepnet.com and Talkaboutsleep.com , and you ’ll find stories of lives wrecked by this affliction , marriages ruined , educations abandoned , jobs lost , careers destroyed .
We reach for metaphors , analogies , figures of speech to say what it ’s like .
“ It ’s like someone opened a tap at the bottom of your body and just tapped out all the blood , and it ’s just gone , there ’s nothing left . ”
“ It ’s like I ’m wasting away , slipping away , losin ’ it . ’’
Insomnia has been with us as long as we ’ve had language .
Ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs record a lament for “ three living hells , ’’ one of which is “ to be in bed and sleep not . ’’
Insomnia may come with the territory of being human , but it has , for a variety of reasons , become the plague of modern times .
Surveys indicate that about a third of the American population suffers with it enough to complain about it , and that as many as 10 to 15 percent have it chronically .
Among the poor , the female and the elderly , the incidence is much higher — in people over 65 , estimates are as high as 60 percent .
Since there are no outward and apparent signs for what we have , no wounds , scars , crutches , casts , wheelchairs , this is an invisible epidemic .
Insomnia is not seen , and it ’s certainly not heard , since insomniacs are not speaking out .
“ Insomniacs are seen as neurotics who should have more willpower , ’’ says Stanford researcher Richard Coleman .
“ Knowing that they ’ll be granted little sympathy if they mention some of their miserable daytime symptoms …or ask for sick leave , insomniacs tend to keep their sleep complaints to themselves . ’’
Friends and family weigh in with advice .
“ A little warm milk — puts you right out . ’’
Or , “ A shot of whiskey does the trick . ’’ “ A hot bath … ” “ A big plate of pasta … ” “ Have you tried melatonin ? ”
“ If there ’s any illness for which people offer many remedies , ’’ says a character in Anton Chekhov ’s “ The Cherry Orchard , ” “ you may be sure that particular illness is incurable . ’’…
In one of his stand - up routines , British comedian David Baddiel asks why , when people hear he ’s an insomniac , they say , “ Really ?
‘ Cos I fall asleep the second my head hits the pillow . ”
He adds , “ When I see someone in a wheelchair , I do n’t say , “ Really ?
‘ Cos I can do this … ” and he hops around the stage on one leg . …
Sleep is personal , sleep is intimate , sleep is interwoven into the fabric of our deepest beings .
It ’s not surprising , then , that we have relations to sleep that are as individual and distinctive as we ourselves are .
You must find your own way with insomnia , make your own terms with it , learn what works for you and what does not .
Become a close observer of your sleep , which does not mean obsessing about your sleep , but learning your body , how it reacts to foods , drugs , light , time of day .
Cobble together from what you learn a way of life that works .
There is no “ program ” that is right for everybody .
There is only what you can find that works .
I do n’t use the word manage with insomnia , though people like this word .
I do n’t manage this beast .
I live with it .
I live around it .
I bed down with it every night , gingerly , cautiously , careful not to provoke it .
I do my best to placate it , domesticate it , dull its claws , avoid its fangs , knowing that at any moment it can pounce on me and tear me to bits .
But manage it ?
I would n’t say so .

元ネタはここらへん 。
読んでみたけど、なんかおかしくね？
これはつまり、n に「 doubleの精度」という制限をかけて、その範囲でなら
O(1 ) だと主張しているようだ（だから『高々22回繰り返せば良い』といっているのだろう）。
しかしこれは間違いじゃないだろうか。この『22』というマジックナンバーは、n
についての制限を取っ払ったらきっと増えていくんじゃない？もしそうなら、この『22』は定数ではなくなるので、O(1 ) だという根拠にはならなくなる。
例えば、ソートのアルゴリズムは一般的に O ( n* log(n ) ) であることが知られている。ここで n <= 10,000 という制限をつけたとしよう。この場合、log ( n ) は高々 14 である。つまり O ( n* log ( n ) ) は O( n * 14 ) となる 。
「14」は定数だから表記上は無視して、これは結局
O(n ) と表せる。なんと、ソートの計算量は
O( n ) だったのだ ！
同じように探索アルゴリズムを考えてみる。探索アルゴリズムの計算量は一般に O( log(n ) ) であることが知られている。ここで n <= 10,000 の制限を適用すると、log ( n ) は高々 14 なので、これ は O ( 14 ) と書ける。定数は無視できるから、結局探索アルゴリズムの計算量は
O( 1 ) であることが証明された ！
・・・
これが本当ならチューリング賞モノの大発見である。懸命な読者なら分かってると思うが、もちろんこれは大間違いだ。「14」という数字は、n <= 10,000 という制限をつけたときの log(n ) の最大値であって、定数ではない。これを定数だと見なしてしまったことが上の間違いの原因である。
元記事の『22』というマジックナンバーも、これと同じじゃないだろうか。『22』は定数でもなんでもなく、『doubleの精度』という制限を付けた場合の、何らかの式の値であって、制限を外した場合はきっと増えていくんだろう。
ただ、n と比べて log (n ) は極めて小さい値になるので、定数に近似する考え方はありだろう。しかしそれをするともはや計算量としては正しくないので、計算量の話とは別物として考える必要がある。違いが分かってないうちは止めた方がいいと思う。
その意味では 、
という意見に賛成 。
最後に・・・東スポみたいなタイトルつけてすまんかった。

You can read the machine translated English article here .
Brendan Harris set upon Sophie Lancaster , 20 , in a Lancashire park after he and four other youths assaulted her boyfriend Robert Maltby .
Ryan Herbert , 16 , had already admitted murdering Miss Lancaster in Stubbylee Park , Bacup , last August .
Det Supt Mick Gradwell , of Lancashire Police , said it was one of the most violent murders he had seen .
He said that Herbert and Harris , who were named when the judge at Preston Crown Court lifted an order banning their identification , did not recognise how violent the attack was .
Mr Gradwell also criticised some of the parents of the boys involved , saying their attitude had been " appalling " .
Miss Lancaster , a gap year student , died from serious head injuries two weeks after the incident while 21 - year - old Mr Maltby survived .
I am convinced Sophie was killed simply because of the way she looked
Sylvia Lancaster , victim 's mother
Prosecutor Michael Shorrock had told the court the gang , who had been drinking , had turned on the young couple simply because they were Goths and were dressed differently .
Harris admitted punching Mr Maltby once in the face , but claimed he played no further part in the attack .
Both Harris and Herbert pleaded guilty to causing grievous bodily harm to Mr Maltby , along with three other males , two aged 17 and one 16 , who still can not be named .
Judge Anthony Russell QC praised the families of both Miss Lancaster and Mr Maltby for their dignity " during what must have been a very , very harrowing ordeal " .
Robert Maltby was seriously injured
He also thanked witnesses who had helped the victims and had given evidence in court .
He ordered them to be awarded £ 250 each .
The judge said that he was duty bound to give Harris and Herbert life sentences but that he would set the tariffs on 28 April .
In a statement released after the verdict , Sylvia Lancaster said her daughter 's death was a tragedy to both the family and wider society .
She said : " First , obviously , I have lost an adoring and adorable daughter .
She was intelligent , brave , courageous and had a social conscience beyond her years .
" Her death has also ruined the lives of those responsible as well as the lives of their families .
" On a wider scale , it is a tragedy for a society which , in the past , has prided itself on its tolerance .
I do not think Herbert and Harris have recognised how violent the attack was
Det Supt Mick Gradwell
" I am convinced Sophie was killed simply because of the way she looked .
She did not necessarily conform to the ideals of those who took her life . "
Det Supt Gradwell said it was one of the most violent murders he had come across in his lengthy career .
He said : " It was a totally unnecessary and appalling set of circumstances .
" I do not think Herbert and Harris have recognised how violent the attack was .
" They have just done it without thinking but they have seemed to have enjoyed it and carried on remorselessly kicking at two very defenceless people who were unable to protect themselves because of the level of violence inflicted upon them .
" There was a total lack of parental control .
" I am very critical of some of the parents involved .
I really do n't think they have taken completely seriously how repulsive this incident was . "
He said that when Harris was initially interviewed about the assaults he was " laughing and joking " with his mother .
Goths emerged as a youth subculture in the early 1980s .
Although initially used to describe a form of music , it has evolved to encompass literature , art and fashion , with its exponents typically dressing in dark clothing .
Researchers using NASA 's Spitzer Space Telescope have discovered large amounts of simple organic gases and water vapor in a possible planet - forming region around an infant star , along with evidence that these molecules were created there .
They 've also found water in the same zone around two other young stars .
By pushing the telescope 's capabilities to a new level , astronomers now have a better view of the earliest stages of planetary formation , which may help shed light on the origins of our own solar system and the potential for life to develop in others .
John Carr of the Naval Research Laboratory , Washington , and Joan Najita of the National Optical Astronomy Observatory , Tucson , Ariz. , developed a new technique using Spitzer 's infrared spectrograph to measure and analyze the chemical composition of the gases within protoplanetary disks .
These are flattened disks of gas and dust that encircle young stars .
Scientists believe they provide the building materials for planets and moons and eventually , over millions of years , evolve into orbiting planetary systems like our own .
" Most of the material within the disks is gas , " said Carr , " but until now it has been difficult to study the gas composition in the regions where planets should form .
Much more attention has been given to the solid dust particles , which are easier to observe . "
In their project , Carr and Najita took an in - depth look at the gases in the planet - forming region in the disk around the star AA Tauri .
Less than a million years old , AA Tauri is a typical example of a young star with a protoplanetary disk .
With their new procedures , they were able to detect the minute spectral signatures for three simple organic molecules - - hydrogen cyanide , acetylene and carbon dioxide -- plus water vapor .
In addition , they found more of these substances in the disk than are found in the dense interstellar gas called molecular clouds from which the disk originated .
" Molecular clouds provide the raw material from which the protoplanetary disks are created , " said Carr .
" So this is evidence for an active organic chemistry going on within the disk , forming and enhancing these molecules . "
Spitzer 's infrared spectrograph detected these same organic gases in a protoplanetary disk once before .
But the observation was dependent on the star 's disk being oriented in just the right way .
Now researchers have a new method for studying the primordial mix of gases in the disks of hundreds of young star systems .

Astronomers will be able to fill an important gap -- they know that water and organics are abundant in the interstellar medium but not what happens to them after they are incorporated into a disk .
" Are these molecules destroyed , preserved or enhanced in the disk ? " said Carr .
" Now that we can identify these molecules and inventory them , we will have a better understanding of the origins and evolution of the basic building blocks of life -- where they come from and how they evolve . "
Carr and Najita 's research results appear in the March 14 issue of Science .
Taking advantage of Spitzer 's spectroscopic capabilities , another group of scientists looked for water molecules in the disks around young stars and found them -- twice .
" This is one of the very few times that water vapor has been directly shown to exist in the inner part of a protoplanetary disk -- the most likely place for terrestrial planets to form , " said Colette Salyk , a graduate student in geological and planetary sciences at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena .
She is the lead author on a paper about the results in the March 20 issue of Astrophysical Journal Letters .
Salyk and her colleagues used Spitzer to look at dozens of young stars with protoplanetary disks and found water in many .
They honed in on two stars and followed up the initial detection of water with complementary high - resolution measurements from the Keck II Telescope in Hawaii .
" While we do n't detect nearly as much water as exists in the oceans on Earth , we see essentially only the disk 's surface , so the implication is that the water is quite abundant , " said Geoffrey Blake , professor of cosmochemistry and planetary sciences at Caltech and one of the paper 's co-authors .
" This is a much larger story than just one or two disks , " said Blake .
" Spitzer can efficiently measure these water signatures in many objects , so this is just the beginning of what we will learn . "
" With upcoming Spitzer observations and data in hand , " Carr added , " we will develop a good understanding of the distribution and abundance of water and organics in planet - forming disks . "

Will humans ever really go to Mars ?
Let ’s face it , the obstacles are quite daunting .
Not only are there numerous , difficult , technical issues to overcome , but the political will and perseverance of any one nation to undertake such an arduous task just ca n’t be counted on .
However , one former NASA engineer believes a human mission to Mars is quite doable , and such an event would unify the world as never before .
But Jim McLane ’s proposal includes a couple of major caveats : the trip to Mars should be one - way , and have a crew of only one person .
McLane worked at NASA for 21 years before leaving in 2007 to work for a private engineering firm .
Being able to look from afar at NASA ’s activities has given him a new perspective , he says .
But McLane was still at NASA when he originally had an idea for a one - way , one - person mission to Mars .
He calls his proposal the “ Spirit of the Lone Eagle , ” in deference to Charles Lindbergh ’s solo flight from New York to Paris in 1927 .
McLane ’s idea came from his acquaintance with a Russian cosmonaut .
“ I noticed the cosmonaut seemed to be a slightly different type of person than the American astronaut , ” McLane said .
“ Cosmonauts are primarily pilots , and like test pilots , they are very focused on getting the job done .
The current American astronauts are picked for things such as their speaking ability and social skills , and most of them have advanced degrees .
But the cosmonaut struck me as an adventurous , get - things - done - type person , like our original astronauts back in the 1960’s . ”
A return to the “ get it done ” attitude of the 1960 ’s and a goal of a manned landing within a short time frame , like Apollo , is the only way we ’ll get to Mars , McLane believes .
Additionally , a no-return , solo mission solves many of the problems currently facing a round - trip , multiple person crew .
“ When we eliminate the need to launch off Mars , we remove the mission ’s most daunting obstacle , ” said McLane .
And because of a small crew size , the spacecraft could be smaller and the need for consumables and supplies would be decreased , making the mission cheaper and less complicated .
While some might classify this as a suicide mission , McLane feels the concept is completely logical .
“ There would be tremendous risk , yes , ” said McLane , “ but I do n’t think that ’s guaranteed any more than you would say climbing a mountain alone is a suicide mission .
People do dangerous things all the time , and this would be something really unique , to go to Mars .
I do n’t think there would be any shortage of people willing to volunteer for the mission .
Lindbergh was someone who was willing to risk everything because it was worth it .
I do n’t think it will be hard to find another Lindbergh to go to Mars .
That will be the easiest part of this whole program . ”
And like Apollo , such a mission would stimulate new technology and reinvigorate science .
McLane feels a mission to Mars should be international in scope , encompassing contributions from multiple nations to represent a milestone for the whole human race .
“ I think people have forgotten how exciting the Apollo program was , and this would bring that excitement back , ” he said .
“ And it was n’t just here in the US ; the whole world was excited .
This enthusiasm would be the greatest effect of a program that places a man on Mars , over and above anything else , whether it makes jobs , or stimulates the economy , or creates technology spinoffs .
We ’re all humans and the idea of sending one of our kind on a trip like that would be a wonderful adventure for the entire world .
The whole world would get behind it . ”
And the whole world would be watching , said McLane , so it would n’t be as if the lone astronaut would be completely by himself .
“ You would have constant communication , ” he said .
“ The astronauts on the International Space Station have an army of people on earth keeping track of what they are doing .
They really have no peace .
Somebody is constantly planning and monitoring their activities .
I do n’t think being lonely will be much of a problem on a mission to Mars . ”
Of course McLane ’s hope is the solo astronaut would be joined by others shortly in the future .
Orbital mechanics provides a desirable launch window from Earth to Mars every 26 months .
“ This person would n’t be there by himself for very long .
It ’s just returning home that would be impossible , ” he said .
Another option McLane has offered is a one - man and one - woman crew , possibly creating an Adam and Eve-type situation .
Unmanned landers would carry living accommodations , supplies and communication equipment to Mars ’ surface before the human mission would even launch .
The best location on Mars would be a low , sheltered area , perhaps at the bottom of a canyon , which would provide protection from radiation and weather , as well as the highest possible atmospheric pressure .
While technical issues abound for even the simplest human mission to Mars , McLane says technical issues did n’t deter the Apollo program , and they should n’t deter a mission to another planet .
“ I can remember during the early days of the Apollo program , there were even many more technical issues than we face today in going to Mars , ” said McLane .
“ People do n’t realize that , or have forgotten that fact .
Several things were tremendous unknowns back then , any one of which could have been a showstopper for a human moon landing . ”
McLane said the early designers of the Apollo spacecraft gambled that in 3 or 4 years , high powered transistors and small guidance computers would be developed .
That was the only way the spacecraft would be lightweight enough to land on the moon .
“ It was almost science fiction , but someone thought it could be done in just a few years , and sure enough the technology was perfected in time to make the mission possible , ” he said .

While Apollo 11 astronaut Buzz Aldrin and noted author and physicist Paul Davies have also advocated a one - way trip to Mars , in our risk - averse society most people look askance at such an idea .
Even though explorers in the past traveled , for example , to the south or north pole , knowing they might never return , and thousands of immigrants moved to the US in the 18 - and 1900 ’s , knowing they would never see their homeland again , the human psyche has seemingly changed enough that a one - way ticket off the planet is not acceptable .
According to psychologist Molly Dooley from Springfield , IL , it might take a major crisis on Earth for humans to seriously consider such a mission .
“ Usually it ’s the disenfranchised that are willing to take those kinds of risks , ” she said .
“ When our present situation no longer works for us , we become more willing to take risks .
The difference between the folks who are interested and those who are n’t is their attachment to their current situation . ”
McLane says the main reason NASA has n’t been able to focus on a human mission to Mars is simple : NASA does n’t get nearly enough money .
“ This has been the case for many years , ” he said .
“ They did n’t get enough money to fix problems with the shuttle , and they ’ve always been chronically short of money .
How we fund NASA is a big handicap , since every year , NASA has to go begging to Congress for funds and justify their budget .
The Chinese space program , on the other hand , has an advantage in that they budget their projects in five - year increments .
If we really want to go somewhere , we ’ll have to change how NASA gets its money . ”
But McLane thinks NASA is at fault for not even considering a one - way mission to Mars .
“ For over forty years they ’ve studied all sorts of options , but have n’t admitted to ever looking at a one - way mission to Mars , ” he said .
“ We should n’t be stuck on this rock forever .
I believe it ’s in our human nature to try to go somewhere else , and we ’ve almost worn this world out .
I think now is the time to reach out and go somewhere else to start with a clean slate .
There is no reason not to try . ”
Something that jumped at me , recently , was a rendering dilemma that browsers have to encounter , and gracefully handle , on a day - by - day basis with little , to no , standardization .
Take the following page for example .
You have 4 floated divs , each with a width of 25 % , contained within a parent div of width 50 px .
Here ’s the question :
How wide are each of the divs ?
The problem lies in the fact that each div should be , approximately , 12.5 px wide and since technology is n’t at a level where we can start rendering at the sub - pixel level we tend to have to round off the number .
The problem then becomes :
Which way do you round the number ?
Up , down , or a mixture of the two ?
I think the results will surprise you , as they did me .
Opera 9
Safari 3
IE 6
IE 7
Firefox 3
Firefox 2
We have three completely different camps here :
Round the numbers down – Both Opera and Safari round down the widths of all the divs to 12 px .
This leaves a 2 px gap ( note the green ) to the right of all the divs .
If you ’ve ever wondered why your nicely - aligned navigation does n’t fill up the full contents of a container in these browsers , now you know why .
On the plus side , at least you know what the width of these containers will all be the same , no matter what .

Round the numbers up – Both Internet Explorer 6 and 7 round the widths of all the divs up to 13 px .
Doing this causes the floated divs to immediately wrap , breaking layouts .
This is obviously wrong as it causes many safely - numbered layouts to break for no obvious reason .
– Both Internet Explorer 6 and 7 round the widths of all the divs up to 13 px .
Doing this causes the floated divs to immediately wrap , breaking layouts .
This is obviously wrong as it causes many safely - numbered layouts to break for no obvious reason .
Round some numbers up and some down – Both Firefox 2 and 3 mix the rounding of the div widths to 12px and 13 px .
The mix of rounding is done as to provide an even result at the end ( making it flush with the far edge ) .
The obvious side effect is that the divs no longer have a consistent width to them ( even though an equal width was specified by the CSS ) .
Additionally , the reported ( via a JavaScript computed style call , like offset Width ) width of the element remains at its reported 12.5 px not providing the user with any indication of which way the rounding is occurring .
And to add another confusing wrench in the works :
The order of which divs have a width of 13px or 12px has been flip - flopped in Firefox 3 .
This was done to improve efficiency and speed and seemingly little , to no , effect on general web site rendering .
I was talking this over with some Mozilla developers and David Baron explained the situation quite well :
We ’re trying to meet a bunch of constraints that ca n’t all be satisfied at the same time ( the proof is left as an exercise to the reader , though I may have actually written it out once in a Bugzilla comment ) : 1 . 4 adjacent objects of width / height 25 % ( for example ) starting at one edge of a container should end exactly at the other edge ; there should never be an extra pixel in the container and they should never be wrapped due to being a pixel to wide 2 . objects that are logically adjacent should always touch visually ; there should never be a pixel gap or a pixel of overlap due to rounding error 3 . objects given the same width should occupy the same number of pixels 4 . object boundaries should always ( visually ) be aliased to a specific pixel boundary in the display ( they should never be blurred )
The one [ Mozilla ] sacrifices is typically ( 3 ) , except for borders where we sacrifice ( 1 ) by rounding the widths to pixel boundaries much earlier .
The especially strange part , in all of this , is that there ’s really no right , or wrong , here .
How this behavior is supposed to play out by the rendering engine is n’t dictated by the CSS specification , having it be left up to the implementation to render as it sees fit .
Obviously the four guidelines outlined by David , above , could serve browsers well but they are forced to sacrifice at least one of them in order to meet most of them .
The whole situation is quite fuzzy and frustrating – I ’m not sure what the best action is , moving forward , but at the very least it ’s in the open now where we can think about it some more .
Life is full of deception .
Everyone deceives others in myriad small ways that are intended to help , not harm .
We falsely tell a friend the kids are screaming as a nice way to end an interminable phone call , or claim we already have a date to stave off politely unwanted attention .
And we constantly deceive ourselves in harmless ways ; I look great , I 'm a nice person , I always do the right thing .
In fact , deception is so much part of human behavior that it 's really no surprise that some people are masters at fooling themselves , and others , and that some people take deception way too far .
Just ask the ex-Governor of The Great State of New York .
Why do some people lie , cheat and deceive with such abandon ?
Evolutionary biologists claim that humans are adept at deception because those who deceive may do better in terms of reproductive success than those who are always honest .
The scenario would go something like this : [ a ] man deceives his mate and has sex with other women , upping his chances of conceiving with many females and passing on more genes than if he had remained faithful .
And during said deception , if the man is both an adept liar and also manages to keep all parties happy so that they care for his offspring and bring them to sexual maturity , he wins even more in the game of reproductive success .
Lying and having a secret life , then , can pay off in terms of passing on genes .
Deception might also be evolutionarily favored if it helps maintain a high position in the social hierarchy .
For example , lying to the group about adhering to mutually agreed - upon rules of society might help keep the liar in a high position which garners more resources that also help pass on genes .
Instances of deception in chimpanzees and other animals also [ [ take out " also ] ] support the idea that it might be a good evolutionary strategy .
Chimps will lead troop mates away from a favored food source and circle back and eat it all alone .
They will also hide a facial expression from each other in an attempt to deceive .
But there are problems with an evolutionary justification for bad behavior .
Passing on genes needs to be implicated .
If not , evolution has nothing to do with it , and pundits have to look elsewhere for an explanation , or excuse , for deception .
Deceit as a possible successful evolutionary strategy is also undermined by the fact that it simply does n't work all that well , or for that long .
Eventually everyone gets caught because people are also designed by evolution to notice liars and deceivers , and to punish them .
As social animals , we see the falsehood on their faces and in their finances , and we do n't like it .
Humans are social animals which depend on each other for survival .
The social glue that holds us together is trust , and once a citizen breaks that trust , they lose more than the chance to pass on genes .
They lose their place in the group .
Just ask the ex-Governor about that , too .

Were he a private citizen rather than the chairman of the Federal Reserve , Ben Bernanke would have been thrown in jail for what he just did to Bear Stearns ( NYSE : BSC ) .
He literally stole the company from its rightful owners and handed it to JPMorgan Chase ( NYSE : JPM ) for pennies on the dollar .
And no , Bear Stearns ' prior shareholders were n't the victims of this theft .
Their stakes were well on the way to becoming worthless , thanks to Bear Stearns ' overleveraged positions .
They should be writing Bernanke personal thank - you letters and pledging their undying loyalty to him for handing them a little something along the way .
I 'm talking about Bear Stearns ' bondholders .
The people who should most immediately feel victimized by this theft are the ones who held the $ 65.7 billion in long - term debt that Bear Stearns had borrowed .
When a company fails to meet its debt obligations , it goes bankrupt .
Its bondholders get first dibs on the assets -- not some bank that has a powerful politician in its pocket .
For those of us watching this particular horror unfold on the sidelines , that may seem like an academic distinction .
But it matters .
A lot .
What hell hath Bernanke wrought ?
First , there 's the minor matter that Bernanke 's actions severely perverted the market 's natural checks and balances by socializing risk and privatizing profit .
If ever there was a signal to other large banks and investment houses to take unwarranted and unwise risks in the future , this would be it .
Second , not every bank will go under because of the subprime mess .
Fifth Third Bancorp ( Nasdaq : FITB ) proudly had this to say in its recent annual report : " The Bancorp maintains a conservative approach to both lending and investing activities as it does not originate or hold subprime loans , nor does it hold collateralized debt obligations ( ' CDOs ' ) or asset - backed securities backed by subprime loans in its securities portfolio . "
Even among the banks that were exposed to this mess , there are varying degrees .
Wells Fargo ( NYSE : WFC ) and US Bancorp ( NYSE : USB ) seem to have intelligently limited their exposures so as not to sink their businesses .
Why should they and their shareholders be punished for behaving prudently ?
And yes , they 're suffering from Bernanke 's bailouts , just like the rest of us .
Keeping the more poorly managed banks from failing makes it much tougher for the companies that should survive to take market share .
That directly rewards failure , punishes success , and damages the market 's ability to cleanse itself through such bankruptcies .
Third and finally , lost amidst all of Bernanke 's heavy - handed government intervention is the fact that , if left alone , the markets still work .
If there 's still some semblance of real value in a failing institution , someone will step in and buy it , without sticking taxpayers with the risk .
Just look at Bank of America ( NYSE : BAC ) and its proposed buyout of Countrywide ( NYSE : CFC ) .
The last time I checked , that offer was made without the Federal Reserve kicking in $ 30 billion in guarantees .
With the Fed throwing around that kind of cash to guarantee loans , why would anyone risk his own ?
The law of unintended consequences
Whether he wants to admit it or not , Bernanke 's actions are :
crowding out private money , thus exacerbating the lending crisis ;
rewarding failure , thus assuring more and bigger shenanigans later ; and
signaling that there are no ( immediate ) consequences to making bad financial decisions .
That 's a long - term disaster unfolding right before our very eyes .
Once we get through this mess , the risk / reward trade - off that ultimately governs financial interactions will be forever damaged .
In a market economy , the fear of failure and its consequences provides the discipline that keeps risks reasonable and their aftermath contained .
If the Federal Reserve keeps bailing out failures , the only limit to the size of the risks will be based on the willingness of people around the world to accept the dollar as currency .
Or in other words , if you think things are bad now , you ai n't seen nothing yet .
For further Foolishness :
LOUISVILLE , Ky. ( AP ) — Kentucky ’s attorney general acknowledged that he never recommended homicide charges against any of the police officers conducting the drug raid that led to Breonna Taylor 's death , and said he did n't object to a public release of the grand jury 's deliberations .
Amid outrage over the jury 's decision last week to not charge any of the officers for Taylor 's fatal shooting , Attorney General Daniel Cameron said Monday that he also did not object to members of the panel speaking publicly about their experience .
“ We have no concerns with grand jurors sharing their thoughts on our presentation because we are confident in the case we presented , " Cameron said in a written statement .
Cameron also revealed late Monday that the only charge he recommended to the grand jury was that of wanton endangerment .
He had previously declined to say what charges he recommended .
The grand jury last week charged Officer Brett Hankison with three counts of wanton endangerment for firing through Taylor ’s apartment into an adjacent unit with people inside .
No one in the adjacent unit was injured .
Hankison , who was fired from the force for his actions during the raid , pleaded not guilty on Monday .
None of the officers was indicted in the killing of Taylor , who was shot five times after they knocked down her door to serve a narcotics warrant on March 13 .
In a TV interview Tuesday evening , Cameron also indicated that he had recommended no charges against the other officers , Jonathan Mattingly and Myles Cosgrove .
Speaking to WDRB - TV in Louisville , he remarked of the grand jury , “ They ’re an independent body .
If they wanted to make an assessment about different charges , they could have done that .
But our recommendation was that Mattingly and Cosgrove were justified in their acts and their conduct . ”
At a news conference last week , Cameron said Mattingly and Cosgrove were justified in firing their weapons because Taylor ’s boyfriend had fired at them first .
Mattingly was struck by a bullet in the leg .
There was no conclusive evidence that any of Hankison ’s bullets hit Taylor , Cameron said .
“ For that reason , the only charge recommended was wanton endangerment , ” he said .
He also said at the news conference that prosecutors “ walked them ( the grand jury ) through every homicide offense and also presented all of the information that was available to the grand jury . ”
A judge ordered the public release of the grand jury proceedings during Hankison 's arraignment Monday .
Cameron said the grand jury is meant to be a “ secretive body , ” but “ it ’s apparent that the public interest in this case is n’t going to allow that to happen . ”
The attorney general said a record of the proceedings would be released Wednesday , and that the public “ will see that over the course of two - and - a - half days , our team presented a thorough and complete case to the grand jury . ”
An attorney for Taylor ’s family reiterated the need to release the complete record .
“ Since the grand jury decision was announced , we ’ve been saying that Daniel Cameron clearly failed to present a comprehensive case that supported justice for Breonna , ” attorney Ben Crump said in a news release Tuesday .
A member of the grand jury sued on Monday to have a record of the proceedings released and allow the panel ’s members to talk publicly about their experiences .
The grand juror ’s attorney , Kevin Glogower , said Tuesday that Cameron has “ yet to answer what was actually presented as far as the charges and the individual they were directed to . ”
“ I think that ’s important to know and my client feels the same , ” Glogower said .
The grand juror ’s lawsuit accused Cameron of “ using the grand jury to deflect accountability and responsibility for ( the indictment ) decisions . "
The public disclosure of grand jury minutes is rare .
Most states have laws that would make it impossible .
Other states , such as California , allow it under very specific circumstances , and some require a judge ’s order .
Grand jury transcripts were released in the police shooting of Michael Brown in Missouri .
But a judge refused to release the minutes of the grand jury that decided not to indict New York City officers in Eric Garner ’s death in 2014 , citing in part concerns over secrecy .
In Georgia , 11th Circuit this year ruled against releasing grand jury records in the 1946 lynching of two Black couples .
A coroner ’s report says Taylor was shot five times and died of multiple gunshot wounds .
It says she was hit in the torso , her upper left arm and both legs .
She tested negative for drugs and alcohol .
The night of the botched drug raid , the officers were carrying a “ no - knock ” warrant but Cameron said a witness testified that they knocked and announced their presence at Taylor ’s door .
On Tuesday , The Courier Journal reported that the witness gave conflicting accounts .
Aaron Sarpee told police in March nobody identified themselves , but in a follow - up interview in May he said he heard officers announce ” this is the cops , ” the newspaper said , citing documents it obtained .

This story has been edited to correct that the court is releasing the record of the grand jury deliberations , not the attorney general , who said he has no objections .
It also has been edited to clarify that the judge ’s order to release the information came during an officer ’s arraignment hearing , not in response to the grand juror 's request .

3rd Graders Gather Weapons & Plot to Harm Teacher ( Photos )
Elementary school students in Waycross , Georgia , have made news in a bizarre way .
It seems that nine 3rd Grade students were angry with their teacher because she scolded one of her students for standing on a chair .
They decided to get back at her and collectively hatched a plot to do her harm .
According to Lt. Dwayne Caswell of the Waycross Police Department , the plot was uncovered after weapons had been brought to school with the intent to hurt the teacher .
The weapons included a steak knife , a paper weight , handcuffs , tape and miscellaneous items that were contained in a bag .
Several students had gathered the items needed to carry out their plan from their private homes .
One student got wind of the plot and reported to the school principal that several individuals had brought weapons to school .
Officials immediately investigated and suspended nine students .
They will reportedly remain at home pending further disciplinary action .
According to the Ware County District Attorney , the majority of the children are 8 years old and will likely face juvenile Unruly Child charges .
Interestingly enough , the teacher told authorities that these particular children were n't troublemakers .
Hmmmm .
Check out more photos of the confiscated weapons after the jump .

Space junk , space debris , space waste — call it what you want , but just as junk and waste cause problems here on Earth , in space spent booster stages , nuts and bolts from ISS construction , various accidental discards such as spacesuit gloves and cameras , and fragments from exploded spacecraft could turn into a serious problem for the future of spaceflight if actions to mitigate the threat are not taken now .
The European Space Operations Centre has put together some startling images highlighting this issue .
Above is a depiction of the trackable objects in orbit around Earth in low Earth orbit ( LEO – the fuzzy cloud around Earth ) , geostationary Earth orbit ( GEO — farther out , approximately 35,786 km ( 22,240 miles ) above Earth ) and all points in between .
Between the launch of Sputnik on 4 October 1957 and 1 January 2008 , approximately 4600 launches have placed some 6000 satellites into orbit ; about 400 are now travelling beyond Earth on interplanetary trajectories , but of the remaining 5600 only about 800 satellites are operational – roughly 45 percent of these are both in LEO and GEO .
Space debris comprise the ever - increasing amount of inactive space hardware in orbit around the Earth as well as fragments of spacecraft that have broken up , exploded or otherwise become abandoned .
About 50 percent of all trackable objects are due to in - orbit explosion events ( about 200 ) or collision events ( less than 10 ) .
Officials from the space shuttle program have said the shuttle regularly takes hits from space debris , and over 80 windows had to be replaced over the years .
The ISS occasionally has to take evasive maneuvers to avoid collisions with space junk .
And of course , this debris is not just sitting stationary : in orbit , relative velocities can be quite large , ranging in the tens of thousands of kilometers per hour .
For the Envisat satellite , for example , the ESA says the most probable relative velocity between the satellite and a debris object is 52,000 kilometers per hour .
If a debris objects hits a satellite , the ISS or the Shuttle , at those speeds it could cause severe damage or catastrophe .
Above is a depiction of debris in polar orbit around Earth .
From the image below , it ’s evident how explosions of spacecraft causes even more scattered debris .
Even after the end of the mission , batteries and pressurised systems as well as fuel tanks explode .
This generates debris objects , which contribute to the growing population of materials in orbit , ranging from less than a micrometer to 10 centimeters or more in size .
About 40 % of ground - trackable space debris come from explosions , now running at four to five per year .
In 1961 , the first explosion tripled the amount of trackable space debris .
In the past decade , most operators have started employing on - board passive measures to eliminate latent sources of energy related to batteries , fuel tanks , propulsion systems and pyrotechnics .
But this alone is insufficient .
At present rates , in 20 or 30 years , collisions would exceed explosions as a source of new debris .
The ESA says it is crucial to start immediately to implement mitigation measures .
This image shows a simulation of the the 2112 GEO environment in the case when no measures are taken .
In the top panel , with mitigation measures , a much cleaner space environment can be observed if the number of explosions is reduced drastically and if no mission - related objects are ejected .
The bottom panel shows the “ business - as - usual ” scenario , without any mitigation measures taken .
However , to stop the ever - increasing amount of debris , more ambitious mitigation measures must be taken .
Most importantly , spacecraft and rocket stages have to de-orbited and returned to Earth after the completion of their mission .
They ’ll burn up in the atmosphere , or splash down in uninhabited ocean areas .
In the case of telecommunication and other satellites operating in the commercially valuable geostationary zone , they should boost their satellites to a safe disposal orbit , as shown below .
There are other measures , like reducing the number of mission - related objects and controlling the risk for reentry , but these are the basics .
The issue is that such mitigation measures cost fuel and operational time , and therefore they increase cost .
In the commercial world , this may competitiveness , unless there is an international consensus to accept such costs .

A vast ice shelf hanging on by a thin strip looks to be the next chunk to break off from the Antarctic Peninsula , the latest sign of global warming ’s impact on Earth 's southernmost continent .
Scientists are shocked by the rapid change of events .
Glaciologist Ted Scambos of the University of Colorado was monitoring satellite images of the Wilkins Ice Shelf and spotted a huge iceberg measuring 25 miles by 1.5 miles ( 41 kilometers by 2.5 kilometers ) that appeared to have broken away from the shelf .
Scambos alerted colleagues at the British Antarctic Survey ( BAS ) that it looked like the entire ice shelf — about 6,180 square miles ( 16,000 square kilometers — about the size of Northern Ireland ) — was at risk of collapsing .
David Vaughan of the BAS had predicted in 1993 that the northern part of the Wilkins Ice Shelf was likely to be lost within 30 years if warming on the Peninsula continued at the same rate .
" Wilkins is the largest ice shelf on the Antarctic Peninsula yet to be threatened , " he said .
" I did n't expect to see things happen this quickly .
The ice shelf is hanging by a thread — we 'll know in the next few days and weeks what its fate will be . "
Aircraft reconnaissance
The BAS scientists sent an aircraft out on a reconnaissance mission to survey the extent of damage to the ice shelf .
Jim Elliot , who captured video of the breakout said , " I 've never seen anything like this before — it was awesome .
We flew along the main crack and observed the sheer scale of movement from the breakage .
Big hefty chunks of ice , the size of small houses , look as though they 've been thrown around like rubble — it 's like an explosion . "
An initial iceberg calved away from the Wilkins Ice Shelf on Feb. 28 .
A series of images shows the edge of the ice shelf proceeding to crumble and disintegrate in a pattern characteristic of climate - caused ice shelf retreats throughout the northern Antarctic Peninsula .
The disintegration left a sky - blue patch of hundreds of large blocks of exposed old glacier ice floating across the ocean surface .
Though these broken chunks of ice have spread into the sea , they wo n't raise sea levels because the ice shelf was already floating on the water .
By March 8 , the ice shelf had lost just over 160 square miles ( 414 square kilometers ) of ice , and the disintegrated ice had spread over 540 square miles ( 1,400 square kilometers ) .
As of mid-March only a narrow strip of shelf ice between Charcot and Latady islands was protecting several thousand more kilometers of the ice shelf from potentially breaking up .
The region where the Wilkins Ice Shelf lies has experienced unprecedented warming in the past 50 years , with several ice shelves retreating in the past 30 years .
Six of these ice shelves have collapsed completely : Prince Gustav Channel , Larsen Inlet , Larsen A , Larsen B , Wordie , Muller and the Jones Ice Shelf .
Antarctic warming The Wilkins Ice Shelf was stable for most of the last century until it began retreating in the 1990s .
A previous major breakout occurred there in 1998 when 390 square miles ( 1,000 square kilometers ) of ice was lost in just a few months .
" We believe the Wilkins has been in place for at least a few hundred years , but warm air and exposure to ocean waves are causing it to break up , " Scambos said .
The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed faster than anywhere else in the Southern Hemisphere ; temperature records show that the region has warmed by nearly 3 degrees Celsius during the past 50 years — several times the global average and only matched in Alaska .
Other parts of Antarctica , including the East Antarctic Ice Sheet , seem to be more stable , though areas of melt have been observed in recent years .
Melting in the Antarctic is different than the recent record melt in the Arctic .
Antarctica is composed of ice sheets , or huge masses of ice up to 2.5 miles ( 4 kilometers ) thick that lie on top of bedrock and flow toward the coast , and ice shelves , the floating extensions of ice sheets .
Arctic ice is primarily sea ice , some of which persists year - round and some of which melts in the summer and freezes again in the winter .
The Federal Government says Chinese troops will not be welcome in Australia to guard the Olympic torch relay as it passes through Canberra in late April .
China has reportedly asked for its army to provide the security after pro-Tibetan protesters disrupted the lighting of the torch in Greece earlier this week .
Attorney - General Robert McClelland says he is not aware of any official request from China , but says any offer of assistance would not be accepted .
" The short answer is no , " he said .
" Australia takes responsibility for its own security , and that is the case whether we 're dealing with a visiting dignitary from overseas , whether we 're dealing with APEC , whether we 're dealing with a national or international sporting event . "
Foreign Affairs Minister Stephen Smith has asked his department to look into whether China has made such a request .
Earlier Mr Smith stood firm in his opposition to any boycott of the Beijing Olympics amid international concern over handling of the protests in Tibet and neighbouring parts of China .
" In the past boycotts of the Olympics , in my view , have not been successful , whether Australia 's engaged in that or when other nation states have engaged in it , " he said .
" The Olympics is a chance to put the spotlight on China but also to enhance China 's engagement with the international community . "
At least two people were reported dead in fresh protests in a Tibetan part of western China and authorities made arrests in Tibet 's capital Lhasa in an effort to reassert control over the restive region .
State media said one police officer was killed and the exiled Tibetan Centre for Human Rights and Democracy reported one Tibetan protester was shot dead and another critically hurt after unrest in Sichuan 's Ganzi ( Garze ) Tibetan Prefecture .

Abstract
Perhaps no Article I power of Congress is less understood than the power to " define and punish . . . Offences against the Law of Nations . "
There are few scholarly works about the Clause ; Congress , the Supreme Court , and the Executive Branch have seldom interpreted the Clause , and even then they have done so in a cursory and contradictory manner .
Relying on textual analysis and Founding - era history and political theory to read the Clause in a different mannner than previous commentators , this Article seeks to rescue the Clause from obscurity and thereby enrich current foreign affairs debates .
Not only is the Clause a power to civilly or criminally regulate individuals when their conduct violates customary international law - as previous commentators have assumed - but it is also a power to punish states , both foreign and U.S. states , for violations of international law .
This dual meaning of the Clause - operating on both individuals and states - results from the fact that the eighteenth - century law of nations was founded on an analogy between individuals and states .
Relations between states in the international system were analogized to relations between individual people in the putative state of nature - made famous by Locke , Hobbes , Rousseau , and others - where mankind allegedly lived before entering civil society .
In eighteenth - century thought , not only individuals but also states were capable of committing " offences against the law of nations . "
And states , not just individuals , were liable to " punish " and be punished for such offenses .
There are important implications of this dual reading of the Constitution 's Law of Nations Clause for current debates about the constitutional status of international law and the Constitution 's textual division of war and foreign policy powers between Congress and the President .

“ Death begins in the colon . ”
Perhaps you ’ve heard this little bit of “ alternative medicine ” wisdom .
Oddly enough , I had never heard it until well after I had become a surgeon ( although my first thought upon hearing it was that it would make a killer name for a rock band or a blog ) .
That ’s when I began encountering claims that seemed to indicate that constipation was the most evil thing in the world , something that must be avoided at all costs .
Naturally , I wondered just what the heck was meant by this bit of “ wisdom . ”
What , I wondered , was it based on ?
What , I wondered , was the purpose of it ?
To answer this question , recently I decided to go back and review what people say about colon health :
Have you ever considered this simple question :
Are you clean inside ?
Well , no , not really .
I know that , like every other human , I ’m most definitely not “ clean inside , ” if by “ inside ” you mean my gastrointestinal tract and upper respiratory tract .
As is the case for everyone , my colon is crawling with hundreds of species of bacteria , where the most common species ( E. coli ) makes up only 1 % to 2 % of the total bacterial count and by the time the stool makes it out around 10 % of its mass is made up of bacteria .
We humans are n’t even “ clean outside , ” either , given the bewildering variety of bacteria that live on our skin and mucous membranes .
Any part of our body that comes into contact with the outside world , whether it be skin , pharynx , or gastrointestinal tract , is most definitely not clean .
Indeed , the variety and rich ecosystem of the bacteria living in various ecological niches in your body and mine actually makes it more difficult for pathogenic bacteria to gain a foothold and cause disease .
Your little critters living all over and in your body are your friends most of the time ( one exception being when your immune system is suppressed ) .
And that ’s completely normal .
Unless you ’re a believer in colon cleansing , of course .
If you believe in colon cleansing , the concept of commensal bacteria living within you is impossible to bear :
Of course you take care of the outside :
You shower , brush your teeth and wash your hair on a regular basis , but do you clean yourself inside ?
In this modern , toxic world it ’s becoming a simple fact of life that our colon ( the ‘ sewer system ’ of the body ) , liver and other organs also require regular cleaning .
Just like a car requires an oil change periodically .
It all sounds perfectly reasonable , does n’t it ?
We clean other parts of our body regularly ; so why do n’t we all clean our colons as well ?
Here ’s the concept behind colon cleansing in brief , so that you do n’t have to wade through websites that I ’ll be linking to ( unless you really want to , that is ) .
Colon cleansers claim that , thanks to our degenerate low fiber Western diets , the colon does not empty itself out properly when we defecate , and that we therefore build up layers of stool on the insides of our colons that slowly poison us , leading to all sorts of disease .
True , low fiber diets may be responsible for health problems , but not in the way described by these “ alt - med ” mavens .
But , here , do n’t just take my word for it :
You need internal cleansing , unless you ’ve been a vegetarian since birth and lived on a pristine island away from pollution growing your own food .
( Otherwise how could you bear the thought of having stuff like you see in the picture INSIDE YOU ?!)
I warn you in advance that this is not the sort of thing that those who are easily grossed out should look at , but this is the sort of picture that they ’re talking about .
Do n’t click on the link if you have a weak stomach , as there are many pictures of the “ results ” of colon cleansing .
( I ’m particularly amused , although also somewhat disgusted , by the series of photos near the end in which the proud colon cleanser has carefully arranged the results of his efforts around the rim of the toilet bowl . )
It is then asked :
So what is the root cause of most digestive ailments ?
Look at the picture below .
How would you feel if long pieces of old toxin - filled fecal matter were stuck to the inside of your colon for months or even years ?
Would you feel constipated , bloated and lethargic ?
Would your bowels be irritated by this debris day in and day out causing what we call IBS ?
Just think about what else toxic build - up like this can cause ?
Stomach pain and constipation ?
Fatigue , gas and bloating ?
Headaches and indigestion ?
Weight gain and a large protruding belly ?
The list is almost endless .
It is –if you do n’t know anything about how the colon works .
For one thing , if you peruse sites pushing colon - cleansing products , one thing you will quickly find is that many of them seem to have a rather unhealthy obsession with bowel movements .
Indeed , you will learn that a “ healthy colon ” should have at least two to three bowel movements a day , or , as I ’ve seen more than once , “ one BM for each meal eaten ” and that they must be soft and light brown .
Some sites go even further and claim that , not only should your feces not stink but they should float .
Here is one example :
Many conventional doctors are under the misconception that having a bowel movement every two or three days is sufficient and even “ normal ” for some .
This is a dangerous fallacy !
A person with a healthy colon should in fact have two to three bowel movements per day , or one for each meal eaten .
Elimination should be complete , fast and easy .
The stool should be light brown in color , long and large in diameter , “ fluffy ” in texture and floating on top of the water .
There should be no offensive odor and it should break apart with the toilet flushing .
Going to the bathroom once every few days , sitting there straining for half - an - hour and passing black , hard “ pebbles ” that drop to the bottom is not only abnormal , it is also serious trouble waiting to happen .
This is , of course , utter nonsense .
In fact , most of the time , stool should n’t float .
As strange as it may seem , physicians , particularly surgeons , often ask patients suffering from abdominal or digestive complaints that very question : “ Does your stool float or sink ? ”
Patients look at us as though we ’ve lost our minds when this question is asked , but the question has a purpose :
If your stool floats , it may have too much fat in it , which may mean that you ’re not absorbing enough fat , which can be a sign of various diseases .
It could also mean that you ’re not absorbing the nutrients other than fat in your food , thus letting more nutrient - or fat - rich material reach the colon , where your friendly neighborhood commensal bacteria feast on it , producing –you guessed it– gas bubbles in the stool .
These gas bubbles make the resultant stool less dense overall and thus more likely to float !
Indeed the proverbial floating poop can be a sign of celiac sprue , cystic fibrosis , biliary disease resulting in inadequate bile flow to the bowel , or GI infections .
Moreover , if you eat any red meat at all , your stool wo n’t be light brown , nor should necessarily it be .
It should n’t be black , of course ( which can be a sign of GI bleeding , as digested blood turns stools black ) , but it does n’t necessarily need to be light brown either .
Indeed , if your stool is too light ( “ clay - colored ” ) , it might be a sign of liver , pancreatic , or biliary disease , and the reason surgeons often ask it is that floating stool can be an indication that gallbladder surgery is required .
Floating stool may mean nothing at all , and healthy people can have them , but it can in the proper clinical situation be indicative of serious disease .
Some websites even go further , making incredibly silly observations like this :
If you ’re not eliminating approximately the same amount that you are eating , then what do you think happens to the remainder ?
The accumulation of old , hardened feces sticks to the colon walls , inhibiting its proper function of absorbing the remaining nutrients from the fecal matter .
Instead it is forced to absorb toxins from the build - up and from the parasites that make this debris their breeding ground .
The passage through which the feces are forced to travel is also greatly reduced in diameter so the stools become much narrower – even as thin as a pencil sometimes .
The first silly part , of course , is the claim that you must eliminate “ approximately the same amount that you are eating . ”
Why on earth would anyone think that that must be true ?
After all , what happens to the part of the food that we actually use for energy ?
It ’s digested into its component sugars , fats , and amino acids and absorbed .
The second silly part is those evil unnamed “ toxins ” again , the ones that are , according to the “ detoxifiers , ” the cause of basically all disease .
They ’re probably unnamed because it excuses these sellers of colon cleansing and “ detoxifying ” products from having to provideany actual evidence for their claims .
Here ’s a more pointed example of such thinking :
It may be said that almost every chronic disease known is directly or indirectly due to the influence of bacterial poisons absorbed from the intestine .
The colon may be justly looked upon as a veritable Pandora ’s box , out of which come more human misery and suffering , mental and moral , as well as physical than from any other known source .
My first reaction to this sort of thinking was : Every chronic disease ?
This is the sort of thinking that leads paragons of “ alternative ” medicine like Hulda Clark to proclaim a liver fluke as the cause of all cancers .
Believe it or not , there is actually a Guild of Colon Hydrotherapists , and this is what it says about the colon :
The colon is a sewage system but by neglect and abuse it becomes a cesspool .
When it is clean and normal we are well and happy ; let it stagnate , and it will distill the poisons of decay , fermentation and putrefaction into the blood , poisoning the brain and nervous system so that we become mentally depressed and irritable ; it will poison the heart so that we are weak and listless ; poisons the lungs so that the breath is foul ; poisons the digestive organs so that we are distressed and bloated ; and poisons the blood so that the skin is sallow and unhealthy .
In short , every organ of the body is poisoned and we age prematurely , look and feel old , the joints are stiff and painful , neuritis , dull eyes and a sluggish brain overtake us ; the pleasure of living is gone .
In other words , if you do n’t poop the way colon “ hydrotherapists ” think that you should , the pleasure of living will be gone .
Really .
And here ’s more :
When the colon does not do its job , all organs suffer .
Uneliminated waste material soaks back through the colon into the lymph glands throughout the system .
When these glands become overloaded with toxins , disease will set in .
Cellular mutation will take place and abnormal growth will form in the body .
It is not hard to understand why the sensitive mammary glands are one of the first targets for disease .
One of the largest sites for lymph elimination is the underarm .
If the lymph is congested , the toxins flow into the mammary glands .
The breast will also take on toxic overload when underarm toxic elimination is decreased through the use of antiperspirants .
Lymph is also dumped into the colon wall .
If the colon is backed up with debris , lymph congestion cannot be relieved .
It will back up within the lymph system causing even further congestion , and affects the liver .
The toxins taken up by the liver are excreted as part of the bile .
When the bile toxins become excessive , the bile backs up into the intestine and the result is nausea . [ … ]
Toxins and poisons are given off by the body but may become dry and hard as the material becomes glued to the pocket of the colon wall .
A person must do a colon cleanse to get this matter out .
Most people have a transit time ( for food to completely pass through the intestinal tract ) of seventy - two hours .
After a colon cleansing , however , this time is reduced to twenty - four to forty - eight hours ( digestion and elimination ) .
An English doctor tested a lady by giving her a marker pellet .
Every day she moved her bowel after taking the pellet , but it took one week for the marker pellet to come out .
Even though your bowels may move every day , you can still be constipated .
So what ’s the answer ?
Super - regularity above and beyond the call of duty , or , as I call it , regularity über alles !
It ’s not enough to have a bowel movement a day .
Oh , no .
That ’s for putrefaction - poisoned wimps .
To be healthy , if you believe these colon detoxification mavens , you simply must poop way more often than that , helped along by a wide array of enemas , herbal laxatives , and purgatives .
In other words , you have to do whatever it takes , and what it takes can be pretty extreme .
Look at these testimonials for Colonix , a typical product designed to remove all these evil humors , if you do n’t believe me .
Of course , this stuff must work , right ?
Otherwise , how could we see such glowing testimonials ?
I still remember a truly hilarious testimonial ( in a rather disgusting sort of way ) that I saw a couple of years ago .
Unfortunately , the original is gone , but it still lives on on the Randi.org forums .
As I recall the original quote , the person giving the testimonial was ecstatic over having 14 - 20 bowel movements a week and sometimes as many as three to five bowel movements a day , and exulted :
We are having awesome adventures in the bathroom .
That ’s just way too much information , I ’m afraid .
Having a bowel movement three to five times a day may be desirable if you ’ve had a total proctocolectomy and had to have an ileal pouch reconstruction , using a small bowel loop to replace the reservoir function of the resected rectum , but that ’s only because these patients can sometimes have as many as 10 - 12 bowel movements a day after such surgery .
Trust me on this .
They do n’t like it .
They do n’t like it one bit ..
Sometimes they do n’t like it so much that they ask their surgeon to convert them over to a permanent ileostomy , for easier management .
The bottom line is that such patients tolerate having 3 - 5 bowel movements a day in return for not having to wear a bag , not because they think it ’s such a great thing to have to go to the bathroom that often .
But is there anything to all this ?
Does decaying , nasty feces stuck to the insides of your colon poison you with toxins and lead to disease ?
Not really , except under very uncommon circumstances .
First of all , the bacteria decried by colon cleansers are in reality completely normal and do not “ poison ” their host , except occasionally , such as when a new strain ( such as pathogenic strains of E. coli that cause food poisoning or simply bacterial strains that “ do n’t belong ” and cause travellers ’ diarrhea ) .
They are even beneficial in that they help with the breakdown of bile salts in the stool , among other things .
Indeed , one of the reasons that antibiotics often cause diarrhea or a secondary infection known as Clostridium difficile colitis ( which can be life - threatening ) is because antibiotics kill the normal bacterial flora of the colon , allowing pathogenic bacteria to grow into the niche left behind by the dead normal bacteria .
Second of all , yes there are parasitic diseases of the colon ( Giardia or entamoeba , anyone ? ) , but worms and gastrointestinal parasites are relatively uncommon causes of colon disease in the developed world .
Third , as a surgeon , I can tell you from simple experience operating on the colon that hardened feces do not accumulate on the walls of the colon as the colon cleansers claim .
Any gastroenterologist who does a lot of colonoscopies could tell you that too .
Even in disease states in which colon motility is impaired , we generally do not see the feces “ caking ” on the walls .
Even in the case of mechanical obstruction by , for instance , a colon or rectal cancer , what we see is lots of fecal matter fairly evenly distributed in the lumen of the colon .
But what , you may reasonably ask , is all that nastiness that colon cleansing websites so proudly display as evidence of the “ success ” of their cleanses ?
One thing you will find , if you look closely at the ingredients of many colon cleansing products , is that many of them contain bentonite clay .
This clay is touted as having been used by indigenous tribes for many centuries ( the fallacy of ancient wisdom–my favorite ! ) and as a “ natural ” laxative .
What it really is is an absorbent aluminium phyllosilicate clay that expands in the gastrointestinal tract as it absorbs fluid .
Often the bentonite clay is combined with psyllium , which is often used as a bulk - forming laxative .
The beauty of this , as far as sellers of colon cleansing products go , is that bentonite clay is responsible for those disgusting rope - like stools that are touted as “ evidence ” that people ’s colons are coated with layers of disgusting waste that is “ poisoning ” them .
Such stools consist of the clay expanded by the liquid from the gastrointestinal tract , plus the bulk formed by psyllium , all coated with feces .
Thus , the product itself produces the very condition that it claims to treat !
I sometimes envision experienced and skillful con men tipping their hats in appreciation and respect when they learn this little fact about colon cleansing products .
The problem all boils down to an obsession with “ toxins , ” “ waste , ” and “ putrefaction . ”
Colon cleansing mavens seem to view their own waste products as somehow inherently “ harmful , ” obsessing about them in much the same way as General Jack T. Ripper obsessed about his “ purity of essence ” in Dr. Strangelove : Or , How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb .
Indeed , if you hang around on enough the “ right ” discussion forums , you will get the distinct sense that they find the very thought that they have feces accumulating in them all the time , loaded with bacteria , to be hateful and impossible to bear .
This attitude is , of course , odd , to say the least , given that the very function the colon evolved over millions of years to do is to remove our digestive wastes safely and efficiently , extracting water , electrolytes , and what little other nutrients are left over , before depositing the waste into whatever receptical its owner sees fit to use .
For the vast majority of people , whether it does it three times a day or once every three days does not matter much .
Worse , in the cases of people who do have a real parasitic infection , all the purging in the world wo n’t get rid of the critters causing the disease , no matter how many times a day one drives oneself to go .
Only appropriate drugs to kill the parasites can correct the problem .
In any case , constipation is determined more by the hardness of the stool and the difficulty a person has expelling it , rather than any arbitrarily determined frequency of bowel movements .
Mild constipation can be treated with fiber - containing laxatives , although occasionally a purge with magnesium citrate or even GoLytely may be necessary for very severe cases .
However , in general , stimulant laxatives , enemas , and purgatories can mess up a colon up really bad and should be avoided when possible .
They can result in dependence on them over time just to be able to defecate .
Another favorite colon cleansing method , colonic irrigation , has risks , too , including excessive fluid absoption leading to electrolyte abnormalities and , if too much pressure is used , it can even cause colon perforation !
During my residency , I encountered a couple of patients who had abused laxatives .
They were truly miserable , and totally depended on their laxatives just to have a normal bowel movement .
In reality , there is a great deal of similarity between the concept of “ autointoxication ” and certain religions .
In the case of “ autointoxication , ” the body of the person with a disease is viewed as “ unclean , ” contaminated by itself , and , of course , in dire need of cleansing .
Does anyone see the parallels to Christian doctrine ?
Consider : According to Christian religions , people are inherently “ unclean ” because of original sin that , no matter what they do themselves , they can not remove .
( Only God can . )
Now consider the beliefs that drive colon cleansing , in which adherents believe that they are inherently unclean , full of “ putrefaction , ” and being “ poisoned ” from within through the absorption of “ toxins ” ( whose exact identities are conveniently rarely , if ever , specified ) .
They believe that they need something to “ cleanse ” that uncleanliness before they can be well .
Compare that to not just Christianity , but to a number of religions in which adherents must “ cleanse ” themselves of evil and putrefaction by various purifying acts and rituals .
This should not be surprising , as the beliefs that drive people to cleanse their colons by various means are not based in science , but rather seem to be more religious or quasireligious in nature .
One thing ’s for sure .
Colon cleansing is a dubious and almost always useless procedure that shows no signs of going away .
There is a thriving market offering an amazing number of products that claim to be able to rid you of all that nasty fecal buildup that does n’t exist .
It may be the most obvious retort in the world for such woo , but the very nature of these sorts of products makes it difficult to avoid–nay , it demands that I not avoid–saying that colon cleansing is a load of …well , you know .
A system of " earned citizenship " for new migrants to Britain , which may include periods of community and voluntary work , is to be outlined today by Gordon Brown and the home secretary , Jacqui Smith .
A Home Office green paper proposing a new " pathway to citizenship " - designed to enhance the integration of individual migrants into British society - will also be published .
The immigration minister , Liam Byrne , signalled the change this month when he said the results of a three - month consultation around the country had shown that Britain was not " a nation of Alf Garnetts " .
But he said people wanted newcomers to " speak the language , obey the law and pay their taxes like the rest of us " .
The scheme is thought to include proposals to make more rigorous the five - year probationary period that most migrants must go through before they can apply for a British passport .
Those who come to join a spouse must wait three years before they can apply for citizenship .
The proposed earned citizenship will include a system of rewarding those who integrate quickly through work or voluntary effort and penalise those who commit serious crime during the five - year period .
Potential immigrants will pay higher application fees if they are more liable to use public services .
The levy , likely to raise an extra £ 15 m , is being dubbed a " British Trust fund " by ministers .
" Money for the British Trust Fund will be raised through increases to certain fees for immigration applications , with migrants who tend to consume more in public services - such as children and elderly relatives - paying more than others , " the document states .
Ministers believe the extra money can help fund councils forced to increase public services , such as housing and education , due to an influx of immigrants .
Local authorities have been complaining for two years that the government does not take enough account of immigrant demands .
Ministers are believed to have ruled out a plan for a fast track to citizenship for high earners or people with special skills .
Instead , they have opted for a level playing field .
The proposal flows from a speech a year ago , when Brown was chancellor , in which he said the current English language test , the 24 - question exam on life in Britain and the citizenship ceremony did not go far enough to integrate new arrivals .
Brown said he thought it was right to ask migrants seeking British citizenship to undertake some community work .
The proposal was taken up by Byrne , and the then communities secretary , Ruth Kelly , in a Fabian pamphlet last summer when they proposed a points - based system for those applying for a British passport , linked to employment and voluntary work records .
The green paper is not thought to have explicitly followed that proposal but will ensure there are penalties for those who do not follow the new rules , including being asked to leave .
Byrne told the Local Government Association this month that three months of " listening meetings " among the British public had shown command of English was the first base newcomers had to reach to earn their British passport .
" Second , we want newcomers to pay their taxes just like we do .
But we 're not in favour of special rights for the rich .
I asked people whether successful migrants , like high - earning footballers or surgeons , should get ahead faster .
I got a pretty blunt answer .
Treat everyone the same : just make sure no one 's dodging their dues . "
The proposals also follow private polling by Brown 's pollster , Deborah Mattison , warning that immigration has become a vortex issue that sucks in voters ' worries about public services .

HOLMDEL , N.J. ( AP ) -
The Bush administration 's top anti-terrorism prosecutor said the United States had ample evidence that a devastating terrorist attack on U.S. soil was likely long before Sept. 11 .
Assistant Attorney General Michael Chertoff cited nearly a decade 's worth of hints that foreign terrorists were targeting Americans , though he did not say there was specific information that could have prevented the attacks .
`` As of Sept. 10th , each of us knew everything we needed to know to tell us there was a possibility of what happened on Sept.
11th , '' Chertoff said Friday during a commencement speech to Seton Hall Law School graduates .
On Wednesday , FBI Director Robert Mueller said there may have been missed clues before the attacks and suggested that investigators might have uncovered the plot if they had been more diligent about pursuing leads .
Among the warning signs cited by Chertoff : the bombing of the trade center in 1993 ; a mid-1990s plan in which an Islamic radical was convicted of plotting to blow up jetliners , New York landmarks and assassinate the pope and fly a small plane into a government building ; a death sentence pronounced on Americans by Osama bin Laden in the late 1990s ; and the failed millennium bombing plot at Los Angeles International Airport .
``We knew the World Trade Center was a target , '' said Chertoff , who was the U.S. attorney for New Jersey when the trade center was attacked in 1993 .
`` We knew an airplane could be used as a weapon . ''
He said he was not criticizing the country 's preparedness , but wanted to help better prepare for coming security challenges .
And like other top administration officials , Chertoff said the nation will never be ``100 percent safe . ''
`` It is never going to happen , '' he said .
``Every bridge , every mall is not going to be 100 percent guarded .
Although we must work to achieve perfect security , we can only approach it , not attain it . ''
All John Clifford wanted was a peaceful ride to work on the 7:39 to Pennsylvania Station .
He would get to the Long Island Rail Road station at Long Beach early every weekday morning , board the train , stake out a five - seat section to rest his bad back , and prepare to read his newspaper and eat his breakfast .
But all around him , there would be chaos .
One woman putting on full makeup while listening to her iPod and talking to friends .
Another inviting guests to a barbecue and talking about personal problems .
Men chatting on cellphones .
They were treating the ride as a social situation , he testified in court on Tuesday , forming cliques and getting to know each other by name .
He asked the passengers to keep it down , but the chatter continued .
In March 2007 , Mr. Clifford had had enough .
He shouted an obscenity at a passenger talking on his cellphone and slapped the hand of another , and was arrested .
On Tuesday , he found himself in Manhattan Criminal Court , telling his tale .
“ I stand up for my right to be let alone , ” Mr. Clifford , a retired New York City police sergeant , declared from the witness stand at his nonjury trial on charges including harassment and assault .

Agenda .
This web site is dedicated to perfecting a universal mathematical language for science , extending its applications and promoting it throughout the scientific community .
It advocates a universal scientific language grounded in an integrated Geometric and Inferential Calculus .
Geometric Calculus is a mathematical language for expressing and elaborating geometric concepts .
Spacetime algebra is an application of this language to model physical space and time .
It is the core of a universal language for physics , providing invariant formulations of basic equations and a powerful computational engine for deducing their consequences .
Inferential Calculus integrates deductive and statistical inference into a coherent system for matching scientific models to empirical data .
It provides a unified framework for data analysis , image / signaling processing and hypothesis testing from incomplete data .
Thus , it supports the semantic bridge between theoretical constructs and empirical realities .
Modeling .
Scientists make sense of the real world by constructing models to represent the structure of things and processes within it .
Geometric Calculus provides a rich language for the construction and analysis of mathematical models .
Inferential Calculus provides a framework for their empirical validation .
This site is devoted primarily to the development of Geometric Calculus with many applications to modeling in physics , mostly the work of David Hestenes .
A companion web site on Geometric Algebra is at the Cavendish Laboratory , University of Cambridge .
Inferential Calculus and Modeling are treated in greater depth at other sites .

Cue Scoble tears .
This is one hell of a technology from Microsoft Research that I think will have a huge impact on how amateurs and hobbyists write music .
The technology and software prototype is called MySong .
In a nutshell , the software records your singing ( preferably in tune ) through a microphone , and it systematically generates an instrumental accompaniment for your song .
The quality is even comparable with a professional accompanist , not to mention the cost and time involved .
If you do n’t believe me , have a look at this quick 5 - minute demo with loads of practical examples .
[ flv:MySongCHI2008.flv 630 420 ]
The technology was developed by Ian Simon from University of Washington in collaboration with Dan Morris and Summit Basu from Microsoft Research .
They ’ve published all of their research and methods in a paper ( PDF ) of the same name to present at the CHI Conference 2008 in a couple of months in Italy .
Without getting into too much detail , the technology uses the Hidden Markov statistical model which has been ‘ trained ’ by preprocessing a database of nearly 300 musical lead sheets .
The sheets come from a variety of sources , genres and popularity to give a broad set of melody and chord sequence combinations .
When it comes to the end user , it uses this abundance of data to find chord sequences which work best for each segment of melody .
Presumably that means more ‘ training ’ can be done to improve the output even more .
The paper also points out “ there is not a single correct accompaniment for a particular melody ; chord selection will vary among musicians and genres , and a single musician may recognize many appropriate chord sequences for a single melody . ”
As a result , the software also gives the end user some room for creative adjustments in the form of “ jazz factor ” and “ happy factor ” .
Both of which have a reasonable effect on the resulting accompaniment as demonstrated in the video .
If that was n’t enough already , the researchers sought reviews from 30 independent musicians asking them to rate the different accompaniments produced by three different systems from one vocal input .
They compared the result of MySong with hand - crafted chords and as well as Band - In - A - Box , the “ state - of - the - art ” commercially available software which they recognize to be the only automatic accompaniment generation system .
Here is just one example of the twelve they ’ve ranked .
I ’ll leave you to judge for yourself .
Original input [ flv:mysong/input.8.mp3 300 0 ]
MySong [ flv:mysong/song.8.0.mp3 300 0 ]
Band - In - A - Box [ flv:mysong/song.8.1.mp3 300 0 ]
Hand - crafted [ flv:mysong/song.8.2.mp3 300 0 ]
Like many cool technologies at Microsoft , this remains still a research project .
Whilst there ’s no written indication of a commercial product as a result of the technology , but I do n’t see why they would n’t or even just release the software as is .
As for future work , they say “ additional development will focus on improving and diversifying the audio generated by MySong ; the system is already able to supply chords interactively to a pattern based arrangement tool , which results in compelling audio output .
Several study participants indicated that MySong would be of significant value for learning music theory ; we are thus excited about exploring educational applications of this technology . ”
Merrill said Friday 's employment figures confirmed the recession
It said that Friday 's employment report , which sent shares tumbling worldwide , confirmed that the US is in the first month of a recession .
Its view is controversial , with banks such as Lehman Brothers disagreeing .
But a reserve member of the committee that sets US rates warned that it could do little about the below - trend growth expected in the next six months .
" I am concerned that developments on the inflation front will make the Fed 's policy decisions more difficult in 2008 , " Charles Plosser , president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia said .
He was referring to the problems faced by the US Federal Reserve , which might want to cut interest rates to avoid a recession , but is worried about inflationary factors such as $ 100 - a - barrel oil .
' Significant decline '
An official ruling on whether the US is in recession is made by the National Bureau of Economic Research , but this decision may not come for two years .
The NBER defines a recession as " a significant decline in economic activity spread across the economy , lasting more than a few months " .
It bases its assessment on final figures on employment , personal income , industrial production and sales activity in the manufacturing and retail sectors .
Merrill Lynch said that the figures showing the jobless rate hitting 5 % in December were the final piece in that puzzle .
" According to our analysis , this is n't even a forecast any more but is a present day reality , " the report said .
' Actual downturn '
But NBER president Martin Feldstein denied Merrill 's claims .
" I think we 're not in a recession now , " he told CNBC .
" But I think there is a serious risk that it could get worse and we could see an actual downturn , " he added .
Merrill said that the current consensus view on Wall Street that there is a good chance of avoiding a recession is " in denial " .
It also objected to the use of euphemistic terms for the state of the economy .
" To say that the backdrop is ' recession like ' is akin to an obstetrician telling a woman that she is ' sort of pregnant ' , " the report said .
Housing figures
There were further signs of the housing slowdown that has sparked off the problems in the US economy in home sale figures .
Pending sales of existing homes fell 2.6 % , according to the National Association of Realtors , which saw its pending sales index drop to 87.6 in November , 19.2 % below the point it was at a year ago .
The figures were better than expected , however , because October 's index reading was revised upwards from 87.2 to 89.9 .
Meanwhile , US phone giant AT&T said it was now disconnecting a growing number of home phone and broadband customers for failing to pay their bills .

Sir Tim Berners - Lee has fears over the future of the internet
The creator of the web has said consumers need to be protected against systems which can track their activity on the internet .
Sir Tim Berners - Lee told BBC
News he would change his internet provider if it introduced such a system .
Plans by leading internet providers to use Phorm , a company which tracks web activity to create personalised adverts , have sparked controversy .
Sir
Tim said he did not want his ISP to track which websites he visited .
" I want to know if I look up a whole lot of books about some form of cancer that that 's not going to get to my insurance company and I 'm going to find my insurance premium is going to go up by 5 % because they 've figured I 'm looking at those books , " he said .
Sir Tim said his data and web history belonged to him .
I think consumers rights in this are very important - we have n't seen the results of these systems being used
Sir Tim Berners - Lee
Q&A : Tim Berners - Lee
He said : " It 's mine - you can't have it .
If you want to use it for something , then you have to negotiate with me .
I have to agree , I have to understand what I 'm getting in return . "
Phorm has said its system offers security benefits which will warn users about potential phishing sites - websites which attempt to con users into handing over personal data .
Kent Ertugrul , chief executive , of Phorm , told BBC News : " We have not had the chance to describe to Tim Berners - Lee how the system works and we look forward to doing that .
" We believe Phorm makes the internet a more vibrant and interesting place .
Phorm protects personal privacy and unlike the hundreds of other cookies on your PC , it comes with an on / off switch . "
The advertising system created by Phorm highlights a growing trend for online advertising tools - using personal data and web habits to target advertising .
Social network Facebook was widely criticised when it attempted to introduce an ad system , called Beacon , which leveraged people 's habits on and off the site in order to provide personal ads .
' No strings '
The company was forced to give customers a universal opt out after negative coverage in the media .

Sir Tim added : " I myself feel that it is very important that my ISP supplies internet to my house like the water company supplies water to my house .
It supplies connectivity with no strings attached .
My ISP does n't control which websites I go to , it does n't monitor which websites I go to . "
Talk Talk has said its customers would have to opt in to use Phorm , while the two other companies which have signed up - BT and Virgin - are still considering both opt in or opt out options .
Sir Tim said he supported an opt - in system .
He 's the greatest technological pioneer Britain has produced over the last 30 years

Life " I think consumers rights in this are very important .
We have n't seen the results of these systems being used . "
Privacy campaigners have questioned the legality of ISPs intercepting their customers ' web - surfing habits .
But the Home Office in the UK has drawn up guidance which suggests the ISPs will conform with the law if customers have given consent .
Sir Tim also said the spread of social networks like Facebook and MySpace was a good example of increasing involvement in the web .
But he had a warning for young people about putting personal data on these sites .
We should look out for snags in the future - things can change so fast on the internet
Sir Tim Berners - Lee " Imagine that everything you are typing is being read by the person you are applying to for your first job .
Imagine that it's all going to be seen by your parents and your grandparents and your grandchildren as well . "
But he said he had tried out several of the sites , and thought they might in the end be even more popular with the elderly than with young people .
Sir Tim was on a short visit to Britain from his base at MIT in Boston , during which he met government ministers , academics and major corporations , to promote a new subject , Web Science .
This is a multi- disciplinary effort to study the web and try to guide its future .
Sir
Tim explained that there were now more web pages than there are neurons in the human brain , yet the shape and growth of the web were still not properly understood .
" We should look out for snags in the future , " he said , pointing to the way email had been swamped by spam as an example of how things could go wrong .
" Things can change so fast on the internet . "
But he promised that what web scientists would produce over the coming years " will blow our minds " .

What are these ?
Ars Technica has some good commentary on France 's insane new copyright law proposal : the copyright cartels are promising DRM - free access to their works if the government will order ISPs to serve as unpaid copyright enforcers , required to spy on every French Internet connection on behalf of a bunch of giant foreign multinationals .
The proposal looks to be an early Christmas present for the movie and music industries–and a major scrooging for French consumers .
For the first time in either Europe or North America , Big Content will be able to offload the tiresome and expensive work of copyright enforcement to ISPs and the commission called for by the law .
If the proposal is approved by the French parliament next year , proponents suggest it would go a long way towards slowing the torrent of P2P traffic to a trickle .
Meanwhile , French Internet users will have all of their traffic subject to monitoring by ISPs to ensure that content is not being pirated ; that 's not good for privacy .
And as is always the case with such technological measures , there 's always the potential for legitimate content , including the increasing amount of legitimate P2P traffic , to be caught up in a copyright enforcement driftnet .
Sure , consumers are thrown a few bones–DRM - free archives , faster DVD releases , and no more massive fines for copyright infringement–but the tradeoff is harsh since it comes with a giant government subsidy for Big Content 's interests , paid for in lost privacy and an expensive oversight organization .
Remember , like the RIAA says , " When you go fishing with a driftnet , you catch a few dolphins . "
This plan will shut down the legitimate network traffic of many innocents , all day , every day .
ISPs will face legal penalties if they do n't enforce heavily enough , but there will be no penalties for over - enforcing .
As a result , the procedure by which French people lose their right to communicate online will be automatic , faceless and instantaneous .
The process by which they protest their innocence and get the right to communicate back will be slow , bureaucratic , and manual .
The cost of this system will be borne by all French Internet users , whose connections will rise in price to reflect the cost of the ISPs being co-opted to do the copyright cartel 's dirty work .
This is the presumption of guilt : the idea that software can tell the innocent from the guilty without a trial , without the chance to face your accuser , without even being charged .
The hallmark of a democracy is that we do not punish the innocent to get at the guilty — or , as Cardinal Richelieu once said , " If you give me six lines written
by the most honest man , I will find something in them to hang him . "

" Sir , I need you to reset your router and modem , and check the DVR box for anything obstructing the camera "
Nothing more than a bunch of guys rambling on about what is in their heads while at work .
Topics will bounce from sports , to entertainment , to proper handshake ettiquette in a matter of minutes .
We just have to do personal work .
“ A guard held a shotgun to my head .
‘ You are a terrorist ! ’ he screamed .
‘ What kind of dumb stuff did you write about your treatment here ? ’
My hands and feet were bound , and someone kicked me from behind . “
That ’s just a sliver of the testimony of Murat Kurnaz , a 19 - year - old Muslim from Bremen , Germany , abducted while traveling in Pakistan in the company of missionaries a few months after 9/11 .
Kurnaz was sold as a terror suspect to the U.S. military for $ 3,000 , imprisoned and tortured over a five - year period .
While jailed in Kandahar , Afghanistan , a Red Cross official wrote a letter home for Kurnaz and it was the “ dumb stuff ” in the letter that infuriated the Americans , according to the cover story in the Spring issue of “ Amnesty International ” ( AI ) magazine .
The guards ’ response illustrates the pains the Bush regime is taking to conceal from the world its horrific crimes against Muslim prisoners in dungeons around the world .
There have been numerous other cases now where the Red Cross has not been informed of the existence of “ ghost prisoners ” , such as in the CIA prison in Kabul , or even told of the existence of a prison itself .
Not surprisingly , the Red Cross has found U.S. methods are , at the least , “ tantamount to torture . ”
In another example , on March 14th , attorney Gitanjali Gutierrez of the non-profit Center for Constitutional Rights ( CCR ) , an advocacy organization of New York City , testified before a Congressional committee that she could not reveal what her client , CIA prisoner Majid Khan , told her about his treatment because “ the government has declared prisoners ’ statements to be classified , ” The New York Times reported .
As in the Kurnaz case , there is no such thing as free speech for prisoners of the Pentagon .
Prisoners who talk to the Red Cross get roughed up .
And the CCR is being muzzled as effectively as if they were dealing with Stalinist or Nazi jailers .
Still , stories leak out .
At Kandahar , Kurnaz told Germany ’s “ Stern ” magazine , ( as reprinted by AI ) , he was made to pour cold water over his head every day .
Then , “ They prepared me for interrogations by putting electric shocks through my feet .
For hours on end they would hang me up by my hands , which were bound behind my back in different positions --- and then a break , and then you would be hung up again .
A doctor looked in to see if you were still alive .
The interrogator came at midday every day , and then you would be taken down for a short while . ”
( Yet another example of medical doctors cooperating in torture ? )
Kurnaz was then flown to Guantanamo where he and other prisoners were beaten en route to the infamous Camp X - Ray , which he described as follows : “ You were exposed to everything : sun , rain , snakes , scorpions .
I once saw with my own eyes one of the prisoners being stung on the finger by a scorpion .
Fat rats walked all over your arms and legs . ”
( Shades of Winston Smith in Room 101 in George Orwell ’s novel 1984 . )
“ We were beaten a lot , tormented , ” Kurnaz continued .
“ And then came the incident with the Quran .
A military policeman who was searching a cell threw the book on the floor .
The prisoners screamed .
When I looked he was also kicking the Quran with his foot .
Everybody began kicking against the doors and spitting at the guards .
Then the Rapid Reaction Force came in . ”
After that , most prisoners refused to eat for four days .
( Later , there was a second incident of Quran desecration , Kurnaz said . )
In Spring , 2002 , Kurnaz was moved to Camp Delta , where he said conditions were “ even worse ” than at X - Ray .
The camp consisted of container blocks , each with 48 cells “ and the cages were made of chicken wire with a bed , toilet and washbasin at knee height .
We had even less room to move around .
The air was stifling .
In the heat , it stank of paint and of 48 people being housed in the tiniest of rooms in great humidity .
The neon light was always on , even at night , and the generators droned . ”
Later that year , Kurnaz over a seven - week period was relocated every two hours so that he could not sleep , to which the guards gave the cutesy name of “ Operation Sandman . ”
“ As soon as they saw that you were asleep , they shook the cell doors , ” Kurnaz said .
“ On top of that came interrogations that lasted for more than 50 hours .
I hardly ate anything at this point either and lost about 60 kilos . ”
He added , “ You are close to blacking out and you move around in a semiconscious state . ”
About that time , Kurnaz said , guards attempted to hang a young Saudi from a sheet and label it a “ suicide ” attempt but the man survived in a brain - damaged state after three months in a coma .
At length , Kurnaz came to understand he was arrested as “ the Taliban from Bremen ” when , in fact , he had no idea what the Taliban was and had been employed in Germany as a nightclub bouncer .
It was n’t until August 24 , 2006 , that Kurnaz was released after a personal plea by German Chancellor Angela Merkel to President Bush .

The CMS detector created by a vast collaboration of 2,000 scientists and engineers , will race ATLAS to find the Higgs boson .

Near the west end of Lake Geneva in Switzerland , buried under the river plain of the Rhône , workers are fitting together the final pieces of the machine that hopes to unlock one of the biggest mysteries of the universe .
It has taken over 20 years , $ 8 billion , and the combined efforts of more than 60 countries to create this extraordinary particle smasher , the Large Hadron Collider , or LHC , built and operated by CERN , the European physics consortium .
The “ large ” in Large Hadron Collider is something of an understatement .
“ Enormous ” is closer :
The collider ’s underground tunnel carves a circle 17 miles in circumference , traversing the border between Switzerland and France .
At four locations it passes through caverns crammed with detectors the size of buildings .
In a deliberately constructed rivalry , two of these detectors — along with their armies of scientists , engineers , and technicians — will vie with each other to discover the obscure but wildly important particle known as the Higgs boson .
According to the most accurate scientific theory ever created — known as the standard model — all of space is filled with a mysterious stuff called the Higgs field .
Unlike magnetic or gravitational fields , which vary from place to place ( things weigh more here than on the surface of the moon , for instance ) , the Higgs field is exactly the same everywhere .
What varies is how the different fundamental particles interact with it .
That interaction , the theory goes , is what gives particles mass .
In a nutshell , the Higgs field is what makes some particles ( like protons and neutrons ) relatively heavy , others ( like electrons ) subatomic lightweights , and still others ( like photons ) utterly massless .
If photons were n’t so light , you ’d be shredded by a photon hailstorm every time you lazed under a sunbeam .
Then again , if protons and neutrons were n’t so heavy , you would n’t be there to sunbathe anyway :
Without mass and its affinity for gravity , there ’d be no galaxies , no stars , no us .
How does the Higgs work this magic ?
British theoretician John Ellis likens the Higgs field to a flat field of snow .
Try to get across it in hiking boots and you will sink in and take forever .
Snowshoes would be faster , and with skis you could glide across the field swiftly and easily .
In the parlance of physics , “ slow ” is another way of saying “ heavy . ”
So by analogy , your mass depends on some fundamental physics attribute , equivalent to snowshoes or skis , that affects how a particular type of particle passes through the Higgs field .
The Higgs boson is supposed to be the endower of this attribute ; it is what determines if a particle can glide along effortlessly like a photon or if it must trudge like a hefty proton .
The trouble is that nobody knows exactly what a Higgs boson is like or even if it really exists .
It must be extremely heavy , or other lower - energy facilities , like Fermilab outside Chicago , would already have detected it .
But it cannot be too heavy , or the theories that predict its existence would not work .
By design , the LHC is the first accelerator capable of exploring the full range of energies within which the Higgs boson is thought to exist .
If the LHC finds the Higgs , it will verify the last , grandest aspect of the standard model and solve the ancient question of just what mass is .
If the LHC fails to find the Higgs , the standard model will have to be reevaluated from the ground up .
At stake is a fundamental part of our understanding of how the universe works .
Peter Limon , an American from Fermilab , hands me a hard hat and a metal box containing breathing apparatus .
“ You ’re entering an industrial area , ” he says .
“ Watch out for bicycles . ”
We ’re about to take an elevator more than 300 feet belowground , into a tunnel containing the biggest , most violently energetic particle collider the world has ever known .
The endless , gently curving tunnel is so crowded with massive high - tech equipment that there is n’t much room for any transportation other than a bike .
“ Best way of getting around down here , ” Limon explains .
What ’s filling the tunnel is the beam pipe : the hardware used to accelerate subatomic particles ( protons , mostly ) to 99.999999 percent of the speed of light .
From the outside , the beam pipe looks like a series of huge steel barrels , connected end to end and brightly painted in reds , oranges , and blues ; it stretches off into the distance like a giant oil pipeline .
Many of the barrels bear a stenciled sign that betrays the international nature of the project .
Some are from Italy , others from Japan or the United States .
One of the barrels is cut away , and Limon shows me the complexity within .
The beam pipe actually contains two beam lines , tubes just an inch and a half across , inside of which streams of particles will speed around the circuit of the LHC .
Surrounding the beam lines is a forest of pipes , electronics , and ultrapowerful magnets .
When the machine is switched on for the first time at the end of this year , particles will make a lap around the LHC in less than one ten - thousandth of a second .
Keeping those particles on track requires serious bending power from more than 1,200 superconducting magnets , each of which weighs several tons apiece .
Each magnet must be kept at – 456 degrees Fahrenheit — colder than the void between galaxies — requiring CERN to build the world ’s biggest cryogenic system to handle the 185,000 gallons of liquid helium that will be used to chill the magnets .
Particles will circulate in opposite directions in each beam line — clockwise in one , counterclockwise in the other .
The individual beam lines will keep the racing particle streams separated — except at four points around the ring where physicists will deliberately allow the streams to cross .
At those spots , the LHC physicists will observe the resulting mayhem with detectors of staggering scale and complexity .
Standing at one of these collision points , I try to imagine the energy involved .
“ If I were down here when the beam was operating , would it be highly radioactive and dangerous ? ” I ask .
“ If you were down here when the beam is operating , ” Limon replies , “ it would be highly radioactive and fatal . ”
There will be 600 million particle collisions per second , and although the particles themselves are mere specks — less than a million millionth the size of a gnat — their collective energy will be that of an express train .
Once set in motion , a stream of particles might circulate for 10 hours before needing to be refreshed .
During that time , it would travel more than 6 billion miles , enough to get to the planet Neptune and back .
“ I think this is the most complicated thing that humans have ever built , ” Limon says , proudly .
The LHC ’s subatomic fireballs will be the highest - energy particle collisions ever seen on Earth .
This is uncharted territory :
The collisions at LHC could spray out strange new kinds of matter , unfurl hidden dimensions of space , even generate tiny glowing reenactments of the birth of the universe .
In short , there is more than just the search for the Higgs going on at the LHC .
“ We do n’t even know what to expect , ” says French physicist Yves Schutz .
“ We ’re now in a domain of energy that nobody has ever explored . ”
Schutz is focusing on one of the other projects here .
His experiment is A Large Ion Collider Experiment , or ALICE ( whimsical acronyms are a way of life here ) , which will smash ultraheavy lead ions together to create a miniature fireball to mimic the first split second after the Big Bang .
In spite of its name , ALICE is one of the two smaller experiments on the ring .
The other , LHCb , will seek to understand why the universe contains matter rather than antimatter or , worse , nothing at all ( to find out more about these other experiments , see the online version of this article at www.discovermagazine.com).
But the stars of the LHC are the two rival detectors , set diametrically opposite each other on the ring .
In one corner is ATLAS ; squaring off a little over five miles away is the CMS .
Together , these two detectors cost a cool $ 850 million , and although their designs are quite different , they are looking for exactly the same things .
Touring these vast experiments , one wonders why CERN decided to double its efforts and costs .
Why not pour all its resources into one detector to ensure CERN ’s place at the top of particle physics as quickly as possible ?
The reason is a fundamental principle of science : Experimental results must always be confirmed through duplication .
In earlier decades , there was more or less a parity of atom - smashing capabilities between the United States and Europe , each leapfrogging and confirming the results of the other in turn .
But when America abandoned its plans to build the Superconducting Super Collider in 1993 ( with $ 2 billion spent and 14 miles of tunnel already dug in Texas ) , it left the LHC without a peer .
So to prevent any embarrassing excursions into the scientific wilderness , CERN decided to build two detectors with independent teams , each to check the results of the other .
As the exact properties of the Higgs are unknown , two different designs also allows CERN to hedge its bets .
As I arrive above the surface of the CMS , British physicist Dave Barney explains that the name of his experiment stands for Compact Muon Solenoid .
A solenoid is basically a cylindrical electromagnet that generates a very uniform magnetic field inside the cylinder ; the uniform field makes it easier to calculate the momentum of particles produced from collisions .
The CMS electromagnet is “ compact ” only in the sense that it is incredibly dense .
At 40 feet long , it is the biggest superconducting solenoid ever made , costing $ 65 million , weighing about 485,000 pounds , and containing as much iron as the Eiffel Tower .
From the outside it looks like a huge steel bullet protruding from the center of a steel cylinder some 50 feet tall , covered in cables and instruments and surrounded by scaffolding .
“ The magnetic field is immense ; if they switched it on now and you had steel - capped shoes , you ’d fly over there , ” Barney says .
The magnet will deflect the spray of new particles created by the colliding streams , while other instruments around it will detect the paths of those particles , soak up and register their energies , divining what they are and where they came from .
Many of the particles will survive only a trillionth or less of a second before decaying , but that will be long enough to leave a telltale trail .
The vast size of the CMS is a function of the immense energies involved .
The bigger the energy , the stronger the magnet needed to deflect the particles and the more space required to register their properties .
“ If you want to build the biggest bangs in the world , ” says Barney , “ you have to give them space to breathe . ”
The CMS is being constructed aboveground in massive sections , each of which is then lowered by crane underground in a process that takes 10 hours .
Down below , the half - ­assembled slices resemble a futuristic spaceship .
“ It ’s like Star Wars , ” Barney says .
“ You know how you ’re always seeing vast machines moving about .
That ’s what it feels like to me . ”
We watch as one of the pieces rises imperceptibly up on an orange - skirted “ hovercraft ” and see it glide slowly and silently toward its mate .
Barney has been working on a detector in the CMS for more than 10 years , and he is fiercely proud of it .
He refers to the rival ATLAS experiment , only half jokingly , as “ the enemy . ”
ATLAS stands for A Toroidal LHC Apparatus .
“ Let me show you what a real experiment looks like , ” says American physicist Steve Goldfarb , on loan from the University of Michigan , at the door of the ATLAS hangar .
Goldfarb explains that instead of using one dense magnet close to the center of the machine , as in the CMS , ATLAS has an array of multiple smaller magnets , with lots of empty space for particles to pass between them .
The upside here is that the ATLAS team did n’t have to worry about building the biggest solenoid the world has ever seen .
The downside is that the resulting magnetic field is complicated , with loops and whorls that will make calculating the particles ’ trajectories a major headache .
Using multiple magnets also makes the detector far too big to be built in pieces that are lowered from the surface .
Instead , ATLAS has had to be constructed entirely in place .
The activity is intense .
I count seven stories of scaffolding and numerous hard - hatted workers .
We are on a gantry , level with the center of the machine , and as we walk along the side of the detector , all 150 feet of it , Goldfarb points out the casings of the various magnets .
The central chamber is barely visible through the surreal spaghetti bundles of cables .
At the far end of the chamber are the ends of eight magnetic coils , each pointing toward the center of the central chamber .
It looks ­eerily like a vast portal to another universe .
Both ATLAS and the CMS plan to focus the energy of the LHC beams into a single pinprick of space just a fraction of an inch across .
That maximizes the number of collisions and the chance that new , ultraheavy particles will emerge from the wreckage .
In these collisions , energy gets transformed into mass .
The more energy that goes in , the more massive the particles that can come out .
Since the LHC will pack more energy than any previous accelerator , it should also create more massive particles than any ever before seen — including , Goldfarb hopes , the elusive Higgs boson .
Across the Atlantic , the Americans still hope to pull off an 11th - hour upset .
For a few more months , Fermilab ’s Tevatron , in Batavia , Illinois , remains the world ’s most energetic accelerator .
Although the Tevatron is near the end of its lifetime , it still has a chance to find the Higgs boson before the LHC can be fired up .
Could the Tevatron really pip the LHC at the post ?
“ I think it ’s going to be pretty tough for them , ” says Ellis , “ but personally , I wish them luck .
As a theorist , I ’m happy to cheer all the horses in the race . ”
At the LHC , Goldfarb is obsessed about the precision of the ATLAS detectors .
“ We need to know the position of each detector to the thickness of a human hair in a machine the size of half a football field . ”
He tells me that the detectors will generate a million gigabytes of data per second .
“ That ’s several hundred thousand DVDs per second .
We do n’t know how to burn that many DVDs that fast or what we would do with them . ”
The first step is to filter out the dull from the profound .
Behind protective concrete , banks of computers are ready to do the initial sifting work .
After that , the data will pass up to the computing center , where the real analysis will begin .
Even there , data from the two experiments will be kept separate , with security systems in place to prevent peeping .
“ We ca n’t have the experiments eavesdropping on each other , ” says computer communications head François Grey .
“ We want completely independent observations . ”
The computing effort is a major challenge in its own right and is one of the oft - cited justifications for a project like this .
The last time that scientists at CERN got together and tried to solve a vast computing problem posed by their particle physics experiments , they came up with the World Wide Web .
“ What you see is a huge effort , but what you get out is enormous , ” says Goldfarb .
“ We ’re going to understand our universe better .
Now there are still too many numbers that we have to measure .
We ’re still hoping for some simple rule , one simple particle at the basis of all this . ”
What if neither team finds the elusive particle or rule that explains everything — will all this have been worth it ?
“ This whole complex detector probably only costs the same as one super next - generation bomber to drop bombs better , ” Goldfarb says .
“ But the sole purpose of this is to figure out the universe .
I ’d rather have people working on something like this . ”

Bill did this in New Hampshire when he contended that Obama was not really a consistent war opponent .
Hillary put this tactic way out front on Meet the Press today .
She said that Obama 's campaign is premised entirely on his October 2002 speech , and she said that Obama did nothing after that speech .
This is just an out and out lie ; there are no shades of gray here .
Here are two examples of what Obama did after his October 2002 speech that I was able to find through a simple Nexis search :
Many of your recent posts on the Obama - Clinton contest are missing the forest for the trees .
They are focusing on small annoyances from Camp Clinton .
The big story of the last week is that the Clintons are trying to strip Obama of his rightful advantage on the Iraq war " judgment " issue and carry out the tactic from the Rove playbook that says , " Attack your opponent 's perceived strength . "
If that strength is merely " perceived " and not real , it 's a legitimate tactic , but Rove attacks even when the perception is justified , and the Clintons are now doing the same .
On March 4 , 2003 , an AP story picked up by an Illinois newspaper , the Belleville News Democrat , states as follows :
" Barack Obama is criticizing the idea of war against Iraq and challenging his Democratic opponents in the U.S. Senate race to take a stand on the question ....' What 's tempting is to take the path of least resistance and keep quiet on the issue , knowing that maybe in two or three or six months , at least the fighting will be over and you can see how it plays itself out , ' said Obama , a state senator from Chicago . "
On March 17 , 2003 , the Chicago Sun Times reported this :
" Thousands of demonstrators packed Daley Center Plaza for a two - hour rally Sunday [ two days before Bush issued his ultimatum against Saddam and four days before the invasion ] , then marched through downtown in Chicago 's largest protest to date against an Iraq war .
Crowd estimates from police and organizers ranged from 5,000 to 10,000 ....
State Sen. Barack Obama ( D - Chicago ) told the crowd , ' It 's not too late ' to stop the war . "
All of this is highly relevant , because Hillary 's account of her own actions in the October 2002 - March 20 , 2003 period ( March 20 being the day of the invasion ) is that she voted , not to authorize war , but inspections , and that when the inspectors were there in March 2003 , she , in her own mind , opposed the invasion and would not have carried it out had she been President .
A key point that has not been made is , if Hillary Clinton is telling the truth that she secretly opposed the invasion on March 20 , 2003 , then she cannot possibly claim the mantle of a leader , because she did not speak out against the prospect of invasion , even though she , due to her celebrity status , had one of the loudest megaphones to do so .
S. 767 ( 110th ) was a bill in the United States Congress .
A bill must be passed by both the House and Senate in identical form and then be signed by the President to become law .
Bills numbers restart every two years .
That means there are other bills with the number S. 767 .
This is the one from the 110th Congress .
This bill was introduced in the 110th Congress , which met from Jan 4 , 2007 to Jan 3 , 2009 .
Legislation not enacted by the end of a Congress is cleared from the books .

Warships may deflect laser strikes
A material that shield ships against high - energy weapons like lasers is being developed by the US military .
The work , at the US Navy 's China Lake Naval Warfare Center , could help protect equipment and personnel while advancing research in the world of metamaterials .
" If you have a ship being hit by a laser , and it was made of this metamaterial , you could reflect the laser beam , " says Dr Simin Feng , one of the authors of the research published in Physical Review Letters .
Unlike normal materials , which derive their properties largely from the chemicals that comprise them , metamaterials are artificially made materials that get their properties from their physical structures .
The material Fend and her co-author Dr Klaus Halterman have theorised would be made of three layers of conventional materials , with the metamaterials sandwiched between the three layers .
Since the material would be thin it should be easily applied and " would n't weigh things down " , says Halterman .
Metamaterials
There are several kinds of metamaterials .
Some , like the ' invisibility cloak ' developed by Duke University researchers in 2006 , channel certain wavelengths of light around a hidden object .
Others , like the navy's , have what is called a negative refractive index .
Stick a straw into a glass of water .
The parts above and below the water point in slightly different directions .
That 's a positive refractive index , and is the case for nearly all materials .
A negative refractive index occurs if you try to stick the straw into the water and it bounces back at the exact but opposite angle it enters the water .
Now imagine the straw is instead a powerful laser .
A ship made of conventional materials struck by such a laser would be sliced in half .
But a ship made with metamaterials would reflect the beam .
And the more powerful the beam , the stronger the reflection would be , says Halterman .
Size matters
Like all optical metamaterials , their unique properties work only if the size of the structure is smaller than the wavelength of light being used .
Since the navy metamaterial would use very small structures it should repel nearly all lasers .
After publishing their work , Feng and Halterman were awarded a grant from the Office of Naval Research to turn their theory into reality .
Even with the money it will likely be a while before the laser - reflecting material works .
But if someone builds it , " it would be very interesting " , says Dr Anthony Starr , president of SensorMetrix , a company that does metamaterial research .
" A lot of possibilities would be raised .
The trick would be making it . "
Roy Scheider , a stage actor with a background in the classics who became one of the leading figures in the American film renaissance of the 1970s , died on Sunday afternoon in Little Rock , Ark .
He was 75 and lived in Sag Harbor , N.Y .
Mr. Scheider had suffered from multiple myeloma for several years , and died of complications from a staph infection , his wife , Brenda Siemer , said .
Mr. Scheider ’s rangy figure , gaunt face and emotional openness made him particularly appealing in everyman roles , most famously as the agonized police chief of “ Jaws , ” Steven Spielberg ’s 1975 breakthrough hit , about a New England resort town haunted by the knowledge that a killer shark is preying on the local beaches .
Mr. Scheider conveyed an accelerated metabolism in movies like “ Klute ” ( 1971 ) , his first major film role , in which he played a threatening pimp to Jane Fonda ’s New York call girl ; and in William Friedkin ’s “ French Connection ” ( also 1971 ) , as Buddy Russo , the slightly more restrained partner to Gene Hackman ’s marauding police detective , Popeye Doyle .
That role earned Mr. Scheider the first of two Oscar nominations .
If you had to name one American , for instance , who clubbed together with a couple of friends in 1965 and spent more than three weeks building a futuristic seven - foot vertical city out of Lego , you might not immediately think of Norman Mailer .
Thirty - three years later , however , the city still stands in Mailer ’s living room in Brooklyn Heights , and its creator remains enthusiastic about his project .
“ It was very much opposed to Le Corbusier .
I kept thinking of Mont - Saint - Michel , ” he explains .
“ Each Lego brick represents an apartment .
There ’d be something like twelve thousand apartments .
The philosophers would live at the top .
The call girls would live in the white bricks , and the corporate executives would live in the black . ”
The cloud - level towers , apparently , would be linked by looping wires .
“ Once it was cabled up , those who were adventurous could slide down .
It would be great fun to start the day off .
Put Starbucks out of business . ”
Last fall after he died , the fate of Norman Mailer ’s Lego “ City of The Future , ” which stood in his living room for more than 40 years , was not publicly disclosed .
I wondered what it looked like .
Turns out , it probably looks a lot like the photograph of it by Simeon C. Marshall , which accompanied The New Yorker article on Lego from which the above quote was taken .
update : Basically , awesome .
This photo was used on the cover of Mailer ’s 1966 essay collection , “ Cannibals and Christians . ”
The city itself was Mailer ’s own proposal for dealing with the looming crisis of sub / urban sprawl : “ If we are to avoid a megalopolis five hundred miles long , a city without shape or exit , a nightmare of ranch houses , highways , suburbs and industrial sludge , ” he wrote in a 1964 essay in Architectural Forum , “ then there is only one solution : the cities must climb , they must not spread , they must build up , not by increments , but by leaps , up and up , up to the heavens . ”
Thus , the Lego city .
[ quote via arcchicago ]
In Mary Dearborn ’s Mailer : A Biography , the construction of the Lego City is portrayed as nothing less than a bold attempt by the author “ to make a revolution in the consciousness of our time ” –if only they could ’ve gotten it out of the writer ’s living room :
In many ways this was a typically Mailerian project .
He announced it in advance in the pages of the New York Times Magazine and , to underline his seriousness , in Architectural Forum .
The prose city he outlined would change the face not only of public architecture but of society itself .
He had long blamed architecture for many of the woes of contemporary society , and now he applied himself to setting forth his plans in pronouncements and , beginning in the fall of 1965 , the creation of an actual model city , immense in scale and meticulously planned .
…
He decided to build a model of a city that could be populated by 4 million people , and to build it in his own living room .
He conceived it as a monument to his sweeping utopian vision .
At the quotidian level , Norman acted as the brains behind the project , soon discovering that he did n’t like the sound of the plastic Lego pieces snapping together ; it struck him as vaguely obscene .
He delegated the task to [ fourth wife ]
Beverly ’s stepbrother , Charlie Brown , who worked as a kind of handyman for him , and to Eldred Mowery , a friend from Provincetown now in the city .
The two men drove Norman ’s 1961 blue convertible Falcon out to the Lego plant in New Jersey and returned with cases of the colored blocks .
Then Norman directed them , instructing them to create hanging bridges , buildings with trapdoors , and four - foot - high towers , all constructed on an aluminum - covered piece of plywood on a four - by - eight - foot sheet of plywood supported by five - foot legs .
Construction proceeded apace , and Norman never really did call a halt to it .
But someone from the Museum of Modern Art came out to Brooklyn to take photographs of the model , hoping to display it at the museum .
At that point , Mailer and his helpers found that the “ city ” could not be taken out of the apartment .
though they consulted movers with cranes and took measurements of the glass in the front windows , they soon saw that it could n’t be removed without being disassembled first .
Here Norman drew the line .
He told Mowery to build a fence around it and leave it where it was .
There it still sits , occupying a third of the living room ’s floor space .
Beverly , who contributed a scale model of the United Nations to indicate the overall scale of the city , professes that she loved it , but concedes , “ It was a bitch to dust . ”
That must be the UN in the lower left corner there .
As so often happens to builders of utopian Cities of The Future , Eldred Mowery was arrested several months later in an art insurance scam .
Seems that in December 1966 , he and an artist / carpenter friend broke into the Provincetown cottage of painter Hans Hoffman and made off with 41 paintings , which they tried to return to the insurance company for a reward .
Only instead of insurance company executives , they handed the works over to undercover FBI agents .
Any photos or documentation in MoMA ’s archives remains to be explored .

Some readers will think I ’m making this up .
There was just a championship competition in chess boxing , a sport with alternating rounds of boxing , chess , boxing , chess , like that .
See , I warned you .
I know what you ’re thinking : chess players are smart , and boxers , um , are n’t .
So where do they get players ?
A good question .
And how do they move those little - bitty pieces with boxing gloves ?
How can you say “ check - mate ” with those teeth - guards ?
And perhaps the best question of all , why did n’t they truly merge these two games ?
Give each boxer a 25 - pound pawn made out of iron , and let them pound the poop out of each other until one of them ca n’t get up .
Now , there ’s a sport !

The researchers have already built larger ' brains '
The molecular device - just two billionths of a metre across - was able to control eight of the microscopic machines simultaneously in a test .
Writing in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , scientists say it could also be used to boost the processing power of future computers .
Many experts have high hopes for nano - machines in treating disease .
" If [ in the future ] you want to remotely operate on a tumour you might want to send some molecular machines there , " explained Dr Anirban Bandyopadhyay of the International Center for Young Scientists , Tsukuba , Japan .
" But you can not just put them into the blood and [ expect them ] to go to the right place . "
Dr Bandyopadhyay believes his device may offer a solution .
One day they may be able to guide the nanobots through the body and control their functions , he said .
" That kind of device simply did not exist ; this is the first time we have created a nano - brain , " he told BBC News .
Computer brain
The machine is made from 17 molecules of the chemical duroquinone .
Each one is known as a " logic device " .
How nanotechnology is building the future from the bottom up
In pictures
They each resemble a ring with four protruding spokes that can be independently rotated to represent four different states .
One duroquinone molecule sits at the centre of a ring formed by the remaining 16 .
All are connected by chemical bonds , known as hydrogen bonds .
The state of the control molecule at the centre is switched by a scanning tunnelling microscope ( STM ) .
These large machines are a standard part of the nanotechnologist 's tool kit , and allow the viewing and manipulation of atomic surfaces .
Using the STM , the researchers showed they could change the central molecule 's state and simultaneously switch the states of the surrounding 16 .
" We instruct only one molecule and it simultaneously and logically instructs 16 others at a time , " said Dr Bandyopadhyay .
The configuration allows four billion different possible combinations of outcome .
The two nanometre diameter structure was inspired by the parallel communication of glial cells inside a human brain , according to the team .
Robot control
To test the control unit , the researchers simulated docking eight existing nano - machines to the structure , creating a " nano - factory " or a kind of " chemical swiss army knife " .
Scientists believe nano - machines could have medical applications
The attached devices , created by other research groups , included the " world 's tiniest elevator " , a molecular platform that can be raised or lowered on command .
The device is about two and a half nanometres ( billionths of a metre ) high , and the lift moves less than one nanometre up and down .
All eight machines simultaneously responded to a single instruction in the simulation .
" We have clear cut evidence that we can control those machines , " said Dr Bandyopadhyay .
This " one - to - many " communication and the device 's ability to act as a central control unit also raises the possibility of using the device in future computers , he said .
Machines built using devices such as this would be able to process 16 bits of information simultaneously .
Current silicon Central Processing Units ( CPUs ) can only carry out one instruction at a time , albeit millions of times per second .
The researchers say they have already built faster machines , capable of 256 simultaneous operations , and have designed one capable of 1024 .
However , according to Professor Andrew Adamatzky of the University of the West England ( UWE ) , making a workable computer would be very difficult at the moment .
" As with other implementations of unconventional computers the application is very limited , because they operate [ it ] using scanning tunnel microscopy , " he said .
But , he said , the work is promising .
" I am sure with time such molecular CPUs can be integrated in molecular robots , so they will simply interact with other molecular parts autonomously . "
On February 24th , a small group of University of Washington students gathered on the 45th street overpass above Interstate 5 , carrying a 30 - foot banner , which read ?
Education not incarceration .?
After an hour of perfectly legal protesting ?
you ?re allowed to assemble on overpasses , as long as you don? t hang signs from the freeway and aren ?t blocking traffic ?
the students were getting ready to head home when a Washington State Patrol Officer arrived on scene .?
We heard the woop woop [ of the siren ] , ? says UW student Jamie Brown , 27 .
According to Brown , State Trooper Douglas
Power told the group to take their sign down and move on .
?
He would n?t or couldn?t tell us what law we were breaking , ?
Brown says .?
He was saying it was a safety issue , that we were threatening people on the freeway .?
Next , Brown says the Trooper grabbed one of the students and pulled the sign down on top of the group .
The entire incident was caught on tape .
The State Patrol is pretty candid about the Trooper ?s conduct .
?
When the trooper got there , he thought there was a hazard of the sign possibly blowing into the lanes of I - 5 , ? says State Patrol Spokesman Bill Gardiner .
?
He probably overreacted .?
According to Gardiner , the demonstration ?
should have been ok ?
since nothing was affixed to the overpass , and he blames Power ? s behavior on a lack of experience .
?[ He ] may not have developed that skill of defusing things , ?
Gardiner says .
Because of the incident , Power will receive additional training and a record of the incident will be added to his personnel file .
Several of the students say they will be filing complaints with the Washington State Patrol .
• During George W. Bush 's State of the Union Address last month , he proposed money for an Urban Pell Grant program for poor kids .

Coincidentally , there are also around 15 million millionaires in the U.S. , and dividing the $ 4.3 trillion amount proposed for the group by that body count gives each and every one of the millionaires $ 287,000 each – free money for the Wealthy Class , taken out of your pocket .

• The emergency economic stimulous package is too late and too small .
The current plan ( still being fine - tuned in Congress ) would have $ 100 billion sent out this Summer as rebates , which is $ 600 for most taxpayers .
• Last week , Dubya foisted his final budget on the American people , saying that there are major savings .
However , the cold - hearted cuts to social programs like Medicare are over - ridden by huge increases in transfer payments to the Oligarchy .
The deficit spending in this budget will be borne by the next President ( whoever it is ) , and is twice the deficit of last year .
This $ 410 billion deficit factors out as $ 1,400 per each and every resident man , woman & child in America =or= $ 4,100 for each taxpayer .
• Bush 's bogus bribe of the American taxpayer gives each one $ 600 to spend this Summer AND the payback is $ 4,100 plus interest .
That being the deal , and the willingness of the sheeple to ask for more fiscal damage to be paid off by our grandchildren – well , maybe Bush is n't the fiscal idiot , the American taxpayer / voter is .
• When ' Dutch ' Reagan took office , the National Debt was a mere $ 930 billion , which he and Bush 41 quadrupled ( an increase of 300 % ) .
Clinton , during his first term , slowed the increase to 25 % , and in his second term produced a balanced budget and a budget surplus .
Bush 43 immediately squandered that surplus and has since * doubled * the horrible number of January 2001 , and will leave office with a National Debt over $ 10 trillion , maybe more .
Dividing that amount by taxpayers gives a portion of $ 100,00 each ; dividing by the population gives a portion of $ 35,000 for each and every man woman & child in America .
( A minimum wage two - income family of five owes $ 175,000 to the future , and thus are effectively indentured servants . )
• But We The People do not have to pay this Republican National Debt .
We did not ask for it , we did not benefit from it – the transfer of wealth from the Middle Class to the Oligarchy was and is a scam , done by stealth and under false pretenses .
So let We The People from this time use the term Republican National Debt in all discussions of fiscal matters .
That way each Republican taxpayer owes $ 200,000 and the Democrats & independents can get busy rebuilding the damage done by the G.O.P. to the Constitution , to the economy , to America 's reputation abroad , and to a government that used to work .
The Republicans and their P.N.A.C. storm troops ran up the $ 9 trillion debt accrued since 1981 , so , hey , the Republicans get to pay that debt off .
This is from a new blog that focuses , among a variety of other things , on inequality :
Inequality and meritocracy , by Kathy G. : Yesterday Atrios made this astute observation :
Lots of people in this country are basically born on 2nd and 3rd base and then manage to stay there for the rest of their lives .
And many of them look down on those who start at home plate and fail to hit a home run .
This brought to mind an excellent essay about college admissions ...
The whole phenomenon of college admissions fascinates me , because college admissions is in many ways one of the few overt manifestations of the otherwise often invisible American class system .
...
One of the most pernicious effects of America 's so - called meritocracy is ... the attitude of smug entitlement it often produces .
...
A distressingly large number of people in our society seem to believe that going to college is proof that they 're " smarter " than their non-college - educated fellow citizens , and therefore more deserving of respect , status , and the comforts of middle - class life .
Of course , not going to college is no cause for shame , any more than attending college should necessarily be a cause for pride .
In the U.S. , low income is likely to be a huge barrier to going to college , even among the highest scoring students .
I saw this entitled attitude ... on display ... during the 2005 New York City transit strike .
I remember how some commenters ... expressed disgust and incredulity that people who did n't even go to college ( i.e. , transit workers ) had job security , decent benefits , and salaries of 50 or 60 K a year .
How dare they !
...
The counterpart to the smug entitlement of the " winners " in our society is the shame and self - loathing of the losers .
In her recent book about unemployment , Barbara Ehrenreich wrote about the feelings of inadequacy and self - blame of those who , through no fault of their own , lost their jobs .
New York Times Louis Uchitelle reported similar attitudes in the laid off workers he interviewed for his book .
The left in this country has a huge task on its hands : to chip away decades of individualistic , right - wing , propagandistic bullshit and explain to Americans how power and the class system work in this country .
We need to get through to them about how utterly arbitrary the whole process is , and how where one ends up on the economic ladder tends to be overwhelmingly a product of where one started out in the first place .
Above all , we desperately need to instill some humility and compassion into our overclass -- and some good old - fashioned pride and fighting spirit into the rest of us .

According to the Associated Press , Ron Paul - - the guy who has raised more money than any other Republican candidate in the 4th quarter ; the guy who by some standards has twice the support of Fred Thompson and in some polls is running even with Huckabee in New Hampshire , is going to be excluded from the final Republican candidate forum two days before the New Hampshire Primary ?
The story :
GOP candidates to meet in N.H. forum WASHINGTON ( AP ) —
The New Hampshire Republican Party is sponsoring a forum for Republican presidential candidates on Jan. 6 , two days before the state 's first - in - the - nation primary .
The forum , where the candidates will be questioned by Fox New Channel 's Chris Wallace , will be held a day after ABC holds back to back Democratic and Republican presidential debates .
" Never underestimate New Hampshire voters ' appetite for politics , " said Fergus Cullen , the chairman of the state Republican Party .
Participating in the forum will be Rudy Giuliani , Mike Huckabee , John McCain , Mitt Romney and Fred Thompson .
Unlike a debate , the candidates will face questions from Wallace around a table in a studio on the campus of St. Anselm College in Goffstown , N.H. .
The 90 - minute encounter will air live beginning at 8 p.m. ET on the Fox News Channel and on Fox News Radio .
According to Chris Brunner at LRC Blog , a number of irritated Ron Paul supporters are protesting via e-mail to the Chair of the New Hampshire Republican Party , since the forum is actually being sponsored by the party .
Far be it from me to tell others what to do , but the Republican Party obviously does n't care an iota for the enthusiasm -- or the money - - that Ron Paul supporters could bring to the Party .

In February of 1906 , Pope Pius X issued an encyclical titled “ Vehementer Nos “ , which denounced France for its passage of a revolutionary law establishing the separation of church and state .
This document contained a blunt insight into the Catholic view of the relationship between religion and government :
That the State must be separated from the Church is a thesis absolutely false , a most pernicious error .
Happily , France ignored this musty blast from a figure who – then , as now – serves as the most prominent representative of superstitious medievalism .
Today , as Catholicism continues to decline in Europe , the French state can proudly point to its strong constitutional guarantee , as well as widespread popular support , for the principle of laicite , or secularism .
However , I want to focus on a different part of this encyclical .
In another section , there ’s a revealing passage which lays out the Catholic , and arguably the Christian , view of what a just society would look like .
The Scripture teaches us , and the tradition of the Fathers confirms the teaching , that the Church is the mystical body of Christ , ruled by the Pastors and Doctors — a society of men containing within its own fold chiefs who have full and perfect powers for ruling , teaching and judging .
It follows that the Church is essentially an unequal society , that is , a society comprising two categories of persons , the Pastors and the flock , those who occupy a rank in the different degrees of the hierarchy and the multitude of the faithful .
So distinct are these categories that with the pastoral body only rests the necessary right and authority for promoting the end of the society and directing all its members towards that end ; the one duty of the multitude is to allow themselves to be led , and , like a docile flock , to follow the Pastors .
This section puts plainly into words something that atheists have long pointed out : one of the primary purposes of religion is to accustom people to unquestioningly follow an autocratic elite .
In many systems , such as Roman Catholicism , the members of this hierarchy choose their own successors , thereby ensuring that lay members have no voice whatsoever in how the organization is run – the perfect antithesis of democracy .
Pius ’ words drive home that , in his belief system , he and his trusted lieutenants are to make every decision , while the ordinary believers are expected to conform and obey “ like a docile flock ” – in other words , without dissent , without questioning , and indeed , without independent thought .
Pius was not the only one to envision the ideal society as a rigid hierarchy of obedience .
On the Protestant side , C.S. Lewis likewise endorsed this view when he wrote that obedience is “ intrinsically good ” – regardless of what the specific command is .
Like Pius , he stated that when we obey others , we fulfill the role we were always meant to play .
These religious leaders view their followers as a flock of sheep , placid and obedient .
That being the case , there ’s only one role left over for atheists to play : the wolves .
Fiercely independent and solitary , we lurk just outside the fold , serving as figures of terror and dismay to those who huddle within its safe boundaries .
( Given the chance , I ’d much rather be a wolf than a sheep … )
Of course , in an important respect this analogy is reversed : in this case it ’s the shepherds whose intent is malicious , exploiting and – where necessary – sacrificing the sheep for the sake of their own power and prestige .
They fear us lone - wolf atheists not because we ’d do their followers harm , but because we could wake them up to how they ’re being taken advantage of .
It ’s no surprise , then , that religious authorities throughout history have sought to depict atheists as unnatural , terrifying figures whose ways the faithful would be best off not inquiring into .
But when those shadows of ignorance are dispelled , we emerge into the light as human beings just like everyone else .
The religious elite whose own power is sustained by keeping their followers in the bonds of sheeplike obedience may have reason to fear us , for our rise means the downfall of their pretensions and the loss of all their ill - gotten gains .
But the lay believers who stand to gain a better life , free from the confines of blind and senseless obedience , have every good reason to welcome us .

Two computer discs holding the personal details of all families in the UK with a child under 16 have gone missing .
The scandal of the 25 million missing records has highlighted the vulnerability of data .
It is easy to develop a sense of creeping paranoia when you begin to contemplate just how many companies , government departments and other organisations know your personal data .

" The average economically active individual in the developed world is on about 700 databases , " said Niamh Gallagher , a researcher at think tank Demos who has spent six months researching the spread of personal data .
She said it would be naive to think that an encounter with one organisation means one isolated database is queried .
Typically data is gathered from many sources before a decision is reached .
For instance the USVISIT border system , which is consulted when Britons cross from the UK to the US , mines about 30 separate databases as it checks identities .
Ms Gallagher and colleague Peter Bradwell will release their report in early December .
" Pretty much every organisation you engage with day - to - day - from clicking your Oyster card to ordering your take away - means sharing personal information . "
That sharing of data , she said , has become entwined with modern life and it was a mistake to think that sharing information so often only has a downside .

Anyone that tries to stop their personal data leaking away often find they are denied benefits enjoyed by those that are happier to share .
For instance , paying cash for everything will keep your name off credit checking databases .
However , without the re-assurance of that check banks and credit card companies may refuse to issue a loan or mortgage .
Data control
And there are a lot of people within companies , government and other organisations that are allowed to use data that can be used to identify you .
According to the 2006 / 7 annual report from the Information Commissioner there are more than 287,000 data controllers in the UK who have a responsibility for making sure that personal data is used correctly .
Personal data in this sense is information that can be used to identify an individual .
Many of those data controllers will oversee many more who actually do the job of maintaining and expanding the databases holding the data .
And it does not stop there .
The web is helping that data take wing and travel farther than ever before .
Government departments are increasingly sharing data
What few people realise , said Ms Gallagher , was that handing over data to one organisation can mean that it reaches many others and becomes an entry on the database they maintain .
" There is no awareness of what happens to that data when you give it away , " said Ms Gallagher .
" It is not so much the organisations with which you willingly share data , " she said , " it is where it goes after that . "
Many organisations that collect data , such as credit checking agencies , were under commercial pressure to widen the scope of what they collect , said Ms Gallagher .
No longer are firms just interested in the basic facts about you - now what matters as much as what type of credit card you own is when you go shopping , which stores you visit and what you buy .
That pattern holds as much information as the raw facts about you - it helps companies decide which socio- economic bracket to put you and how to go about tailoring marketing to fit you and your lifestyle .
Watching them
Surveillance and the collection of data about people has become so pervasive that it has spawned a dedicated research organisation - the Surveillance Studies Network .
Dr Kirstie Ball , a senior lecturer at the Open University , said that although many social scientists been studied the subject for years the pervasiveness of that scrutiny was prompting an upsurge of interest .
" That personal data held by every organisation you interact with runs the parameters of your existence , your consumption , your entitlements , " she said .
Almost every time you fill in a form the data makes it to a database
" We 're all interested in the collection and application of personal data and its consequences for individual rights and social science concepts such as trust and discrimination , " said Dr Ball .
" It merits study and understanding because its consequences can be tangible , " she said .
For instance , she said , an employee ticking the wrong box when they enter your data into a database could mean a person ends up labelled as a former criminal or credit liability .
It is possible to ask to see the data that companies and organisations hold about you , but a very small number of people take up this opportunity to vet what is known about them .
Making sure all of it is accurate would be a mammoth task .
For Ms Gallagher at Demos beefing up the power of the Information Commissioner to enforce the Data Protection
Act would help redress some of the imbalance between the data companies hold about us .
" Organisations and companies should be responding to the way we live , " she said .
Only by using those powers will the creeping spread of that data be held stemmed .
" You are not going to get people complying with data protection on the basis of good will , " she said .
" Data is just too valuable . "
Her Majesty 's Revenue and Customs has set up a Child Benefit Helpline on 0845 302 1444 for customers who want more details .
The first cut caused widespread disruption to net services
The Falcon cable , owned by a firm which operates another damaged cable , led to a " critical " telecom breakdown , according to one local official .
The cause of the latest break has not been confirmed but a repair ship has been deployed , said owner Flag Telecom .
The earlier break disrupted service in Egypt , the Middle East and India .
" The situation is critical for us in terms of congestion , " Omar Sultan , chief executive of Dubai's ISP DU , told The Associated Press , following the most recent break .
Wednesday 's incident caused disruption to 70 % of the nationwide internet network in Egypt on Wednesday , while India suffered up to 60 % disruption .
Flag Telecom said a repair ship was expected to arrive at the site of the first break - 8.3 km from Alexandria in Egypt - on 5 February , with repair work expected to take a week .
A repair ship deployed to the second break - 56 km from Dubai - was expected to arrive at the site in the " next few days " , the firm said .
Web returns
The first cable - the Fiber - Optic Link Around the Globe ( FLAG ) - was cut at 0800 on 30 January , the firm said .
INSIDE A SUBMARINE CABLE 1 Polyethylene cover
2,4 Stranded steel armour wires
3,5 Tar - soaked nylon yarn
6 Polycarbonate insulator
7 Copper sheath
8 Protective core
9 Optical fibres
Not to scale
A second cable thought to lie alongside it - SEA - ME - WE 4 , or the South East Asia - Middle East - West Europe 4 cable - was also split .
FLAG is a 28,000 km ( 17,400 mile ) long submarine communications cable that links Australia and Japan with Europe via India and the Middle East .
SEA -ME-WE 4 is a submarine cable linking South East Asia to Europe via the Indian subcontinent and the Middle East .
The two cable cuts meant that the only cable in service connecting Europe to the Middle East via Egypt was the older Sea - M - We 3 system , according to research firm TeleGeography .
The firm said the cuts reduced the amount of available capacity on the stretch of network between India and Europe by 75 % percent .
As a result , carriers in Egypt and the Middle East re-routed their European traffic around the globe , through South East Asia and across the Pacific and Atlantic oceans .
The cause of the break has still not been confirmed .
Initial reports suggested that it could have been snapped by a ship 's anchor .
But Egypt 's communications ministry said damage to the cables in the Mediterranean was not caused by ships .
The transport ministry said that footage recorded by onshore video cameras of the location of the cables showed no maritime traffic in the area when the cables were damaged .
" The ministry 's maritime transport committee reviewed footage covering the period of 12 hours before and 12 hours after the cables were cut and no ships sailed the area , " a statement said .
Internet service providers said they expected India 's to be back to about 80 % of its usual speed by the end of Friday .
In Egypt Minister of Communications and Information Technology Tarek Kamil said he expected to be at the same capacity within two days .
" However , it 's not before ten days until the internet service returns to its normal performance , " Kamil told the state Al - Ahram newspaper .
In 2005 , a book entitiled , The Game , hit The New York Times bestseller list and exposed to the world an underground community of pickup artists to the world .
Intrigued by the The Game ’s popularity , I read Neil Strauss ’ book and was both shocked and awed by the seduction community and its sophisticated methods .
Like most readers of The Game , I googled the more colorful pickup artists mentioned in the book , for example “ Mystery ” and “ Lovedrop . ”
What I found was a series of internet message boards engineered to help pickup artists exchange information , advice , and experiences .
While I did find the expected misogynists on seduction message boards , I also encountered a group of insatiable students of human psychology .
Phrases like “ social proof , ” “ real social dynamics , ” “ metaphorical buyer ’s remorse , ” and “ demonstrations of higher value ” were tossed around casually .
Furthermore , there was an absence of the anticipated fratboy - esque dialog .
Most surprisingly , however , I encountered more than a few married people who were using the methods , techniques , and philosophies of the seduction community to enliven their marriages and become more attractive to their partners .
Here are 8 tips ( of several more ) these men learned from the seduction community about “ picking up ” their wives :
Do n’t be a puppy dog : Pickup artists often observe that “ AFCs ” ( average frustrated chumps ) follow beautiful women around like puppy dogs , trying to buy them drinks , and sycophantically sucking up to them .
While it ’s important to give your spouse attention and let them know you care , smothering is a bad idea and can extinguish passion .
Give your spouse some space and room to breathe .
As one pickup artist is famous for saying , “ give them the gift of missing you . ”
Be occasionally unpredictable :
In the right circumstances and the right contexts , unpredictability is exciting and interesting .
If you and your spouse are stuck in some ruts , try switching things up and surprising them .
Leave them trying to guess what you ’ll do next .
If you normally go out to eat on Thursday nights , try ordering takeout and bringing your spouse to roller derby bout instead .
Do n’t go on “ dates ” :
Most pickup artists believe that traditional dates ( like dinner and a movie ) do nothing to create attraction .
Instead , go to a busy street , buy ice - cream , and people watch , or go for a drive and find a makeout spot .
You get the picture .
Be interesting : Pickup artists often practice magic , know a thing or two about palmistry and handwriting analysis , and can tell a great story when needed .
The intent is not to be a dancing monkey performing tricks on demand ; rather , the goal is to be different , interesting , and memorable .
While handwriting analysis or palmistry may get you nowhere with your spouse , learning to rock climb or play a banjo will introduce an additional attractive dimension to your personality .
Showing your spouse how to rock climb , or playing the banjo for her , however , will be even more attractive .
Talk slowly : Pickup artists often purchase voice recorders to help slow down and deepen their voice .
Speaking slowly , deliberately , and with varied inflection implies confidence , which is the universal aphrodisiac .
Be decisive : Pickup artists train to be decisive , and when they suggest a date they always have a time , a date , and a place in mind .
None of this “ I ’d like to do whatever you want to do ” stuff .
Decisiveness is sexy , and one can be decisive without being pushy or overpowering .
If you suggest a date , then know where you want to go , what time you want to be there , and what you want to do afterwards .
If your spouse wants to do something else then that ’s fine , but try to always have a plan .
Decision making can be exhausting , especially after a long day of work , so be willing to relieve your spouse of that role and create experiences .
Two steps forward , one step back :
With this mantra , pickup artists learn to create expectation during , um … , times of closeness .
If you ’re in the middle of kissing , then stop for a bit , let expectations build , and then resume and let things build up to the next level .
Try stopping again at that point to let expectations build once again .
Maintain this pattern for as long as you can and you ’ll drive your spouse crazy ( in a good way ) .
Never ever be negative :
The consensus in the seduction community is that negativity kills attraction and Neil Strauss , author of The Game , is known for giving away a dollar each time he makes a negative comment .
While giving away money might be too strong of a medicine for your taste , know that the elimination of negativity and negative comments will likely do wonders for your marriage .
Good luck tonight !

Melissa helped Rey through it , feeding him antibiotics and massaging his postsurgery chest with arnica cream .
He joined a campus trans organization , GendeRevolution .
In a few short months , he had become a full - blown activist .
He quit smoking .
To cap it off , he was bar - mitzvahed in Israel in January .
He ’d had his bat mitzvah at 13 , but as Rey put it , he did n’t feel “ connected to the experience . ”
He was bar - mitzvahed without his parents in attendance , but he took the rite of passage to heart .
After all , at 13 he ’d become a woman .
Now , at 18 , he was a man .
Despite the seriousness of the issues Rey has dealt with , all in such a short time , he often seemed like a giddy teenager , probably because he still was one .
Clad in his usual uniform of baggy pants and a B - Boy cap covered with images of euros , he gossiped about his friends , music , sex and food , from time to time throwing his arm around Melissa , who is pixielike , slim and Rey ’s height  a little over five feet .
She was wearing skinny jeans and ballet flats .
She was so supportive of Rey ’s transformation that she was taken aback when I asked if his period of postoperative recovery had been hard for her .
“ He ’s so much happier now , ” she said .
Even though Melissa always defined herself as a lesbian , she said her partner ’s transition made sense to her .
Part of the couple ’s sangfroid is generational  she and Rey see themselves as genderqueer rather than gay .
For them , sexual orientation is fluid .
Like some of their peers , Melissa and Rey want to be  and sometimes imagine they already are  part of the first generation to transcend gender .
On the face of it , it ’s not surprising that students like Rey would choose to attend a women ’s college .
Same - sex colleges have always been test beds for transformations among American women .
Set up as places where women could flourish without men , colleges like Barnard , Wellesley , Smith and Mount Holyoke have always had dual personalities , serving both as finishing schools and as incubators of American feminism .
Smith College ’s alumnae include not only Barbara Bush and Nancy Reagan but also Betty Friedan , Gloria Steinem and Catharine MacKinnon .
The schools that decided to remain single - sex in the 1970s , when many colleges around the country went coed , represented a significant and even controversial challenge to liberal ideas about gender equality .
And in refashioning their identities for the time , many became loci for the interrogation of gender roles .
It was , after all , at all - female schools that many young women first began to question the very notion of femininity .
And this questioning found echoes in the curriculum .
Scholars like Esther Newton , Gayle Rubin , Anne Fausto - Sterling and Judith Butler ushered in an era that reconceived gender as a social construct , distinct from both a person ’s sex and sexuality .
For Butler and others , femaleness did not automatically produce femininity and maleness did not produce masculinity : gender was fluid and variable , something to be fashioned , and could shift in character depending on the culture or the time period .
As some see it , the presence of trans students at single - sex colleges is simply a logical extension of this intellectual tradition .
Indeed , as one transmale student I spoke to at Wellesley pointed out , women ’s colleges are uniquely suited to transgender students .
“ There ’s no safer place for transmen to be than a women ’s college because there ’s no actual physical threat to us , ” he told me , adding , “ I have more in common with women because of that shared experience than I do with men . ”
And even though Rey chose to leave Barnard for a coed school , he also says that women ’s schools can  and should  act as havens for transmale students , that they are , in fact , natural beacons for trans people , because “ feminists and trans activists are both interested in gender . ”
In a sense , transgender and genderqueer students could be said merely to be holding women ’s colleges to their word : to fully support women ’s exploration of gender , even if that exploration ends with students no longer being female - identified .
As Judith Halberstam , a professor of English and gender studies at the University of Southern California and the author of “ Female Masculinity , ” put it , feminist theory offers students a way to think about gender as performance , to create a trans self or a genderqueer one  and give that self contours , definition  in a way that was simply unavailable 30 years ago .
Indeed ,
Rey discovered his own trans identity reading queer theory , and even transitioning to be a man has n’t changed his core sense of himself .
“ I ’m still queer even though I am a man now  it ’s the beauty of the term , ” Rey said .
news For The Good Of All Of Us
Photos ( top , and bottom ) by wvs from the Torontoist Flickr Pool .
The whole wide internet is getting crushes on it , so it ’s about time we wrote about Posterchild ’s brand new Bloor Street project : a portal !
Posterchild — who , full disclosure , publishes Vandalist here every Friday — likes video games : his Super Mario question blocks from 2005 ( which are pretty much exactly what they sound like ) drew imitators and attention worldwide , most notably in Raveena , Ohio , where police called in a bomb squad after five teenaged girls made some blocks of their own and placed them around the city .
So here we are , three years later , with two matching pieces far more likely to confuse people unfamiliar with video games : a Weighted Companion Cube stuck in a portal , straight out of the video game Portal .
The first installation — or rather , the first half — is up on Bloor by Euclid ( pictured above , at top ) ; the second is up on Yonge by Bloor ( above , at bottom ) .
The two parts of the portal are “ doorways in space , ” explained Posterchild , and the idea is that you can teleport the two and a half kilometres between them .
Stuck in between them is a Weighted Companion Cubes , objects which “ are tricky to explain if you have n’t played Portal , ” Posterchild told us .
According to Wikipedia , they ’re “ a waist - high crate with pink hearts on each face ” and “ can be used to depress large buttons to open doors or activate platforms , ” and they have some kind of weird cult following .
So …yeah !
Posterchild admitted it ’s “ maybe best to just call it an in joke ? ”
Both halves of the were put up last Sunday , March 16 , and , at last check , both were still up .
Catch them while you can — even if you do n’t really totally get it , it ’ll be hard to overstate your satisfaction .
In the interim , Posterchild was nice enough to send us two exclusive photos of the pieces being installed , after the fold .
Colbert on McCain : ' Clearly he has hundreds of years of experience ' David Edwards and Muriel Kane

In a segment of his comedy show , Stephen Colbert attacked Senator John McCain 's claims to be the candidate with experience , pointing out that McCain is " experienced enough to know that some experience is relevant , like the fact that he has experience , while other experience , like his previous experiences , are irrelevant . "
Last week , Barack Obama said in response to a question that " if al Qaeda is forming a base in Iraq " after a US withdrawal , " we will have to act . "
John McCain used that remark two days later to imply that Obama is n't aware there already are al Qaeda members in Iraq , to which Obama retorted that they were n't there before George Bush and John McCain decided to invade .
McCain 's final comeback was , " That 's history , that 's the past . "
" Exactly , " said Colbert .
" It 's ancient history .
Who knows who invaded Iraq ?
I do n't . "
" But there 's something here far more important than Iraq , " Colbert went on .
" Experience .
Senator McCain is running on one thing .
...
Look at the man .
Clearly he has hundreds of years of experience .
And yet when you question his record , he says this : ' I want to make it very clear : this is not about decisions that were made in the past . ' "
" Now , ' decisions that were made in the past ' is how people without experience define experience , " Colbert observed .
" So how can McCain claim to be more qualified of a candidate because of his experience yet also claim that any history of bad decisions is irrelevant ? "
" There is an easier way to say it , " Colbert continued , playing a clip of McCain saying , " We are where we are now . "
Colbert then explained that in McCain 's view of the world , we 're always " where we are " and never where " we were " or where " we will be . "
" We can question him only in the past - less and future - less present , " concluded Colbert .
" This infinitely thin slice of existence .
This zero - dimensional theoretical plot - point of the now , where eternity intersects time . "
" And if that 's what he 's saying , the question is not ' Senator , how did you vote ? ' or ' Senator , when will we withdraw ? ' but ' Senator McCain -- are you high ? "

Transcript via closed captions :: let 's talk about john mccain .
you know , i could actually see myself growing to like the guy .
oh , i hate you !
i'm sorry that just snuck up on me .
last week mccain got another conservative endorsement .
this time from evangelical minister john hagee and boy was mccain was honored to learn it .
jim ? :: i'm very honored by pastor john hagee 's endorsement today . :: stephen : honored to be endorsed by hagee who has called the catholic church quote " a false cult system , the apostate church and the great whore . " man , i wish this guy could have been alive in late 15th century spain .
now , i'm a catholic , folks , but as a good christian i have to turn the other cheek .
my guest does not .
here to express my outrage for me is the president of catholic league and friend of the show william donna hue -- donohue .
bill ?
are you ready ?
go nuts . :: thank you , stephen .
[ cheers and applause ] we at the catholic league are very familiar with reverend john hagee 's long history of anti-catholic bigotry and the slant he has made our -- against our faith .
in my estimation he is a real tool kit . :: :: stephen : thank you .
well put .
for the record you called jon stewart an anti-catholic bigot when he pointed out the pope had a funny hat s. that right ? :: i did , indeed .
thank you sir . :: stephen : bill donohue .
nation , . [ applause ] -- this is my favorite part of campaign season , when candidates start reaching across the aisle with their first tentative bitch slap .
it started when tim russert asked barack obama whether he would reinvade iraq if american troops left and al qaeda resurged .
take a look at obama 's naive answer .
if al qaeda is forming a base in iraq , then we will have toll act in a way that secures the american homeland and and our interest abroad . :: stephen : if al qaeda .
you know the old saying , if if 's and but 's were candy and nuts we already be bombing iran .
luckily mccain set him straight and they went at it . :: i have news for senator obama , al qaeda is in iraq . :: i have some news for john mccain and that there -- is that there was no such thing as al qaeda in iraq until george bush and john mccain decided to invade iraq . :: :: stephen : i have some news for both of them .
angelina is totally pregnanters again . -- preggers again . [ cheers and applause ] but concerning his vote authorizing the war , mccain had the perfect comeback . :: yesterday senator owe buma said well , we -- obama said well , we should n't have gone in this the first place and if we had n't gone in this the first place , we would n't be facing this problem .
that 's history .
that 's the past . :: stephen : exactly .
ancient history .
who knows who invaded iraq .
i do n't .
in fact , senator obama if you keep complaining about the war , i'm going to have to conclude that he who smelt it , dealt it .
that deserves applause .
[ cheers and applause ] but there 's something here far more important than iraq and it brings us to tonight 's word .
[ cheers and applause ] experience .
senator mccain is running on one thing : jimmy ? :: i believe that my experience and background qualifies me to lead . :: i have the judgment and the experience . :: i have the experience , my life , my experience .
experience .
that 's because i have the experience . :: stephen : exactly .
look at the man .
clearly he has hundreds of years of experience .
[ laughter ] and yes , when you question his record he says this : i want to make it very clear this is not about excisions that were made -- decisions that were made in the past .
now decisions that were made in the past is how people without experience define experience .
[ laughter ] so how can mccain claim to be more qualified of a candidate because of his experience yet also claim that any history of bad decisions is irrelevant ?
easy .
experience .
you see , he is experienced enough to know that some experience is relevant , like the fact that he has experience .
while other experience like his previous experiences are irrelevant .
plus , there soon easier way to say it .
jim ? :: where we are -- we are where we are now .
we are where we are now . :: stephen : for all those obama man maniacs out there -- [ cheers and applause ] i'm not just taking john mccain 's word for it .
when he says we are where we are i verify with my where - are , meter .
i made this .
there 's fans of arts and crafts tonight .
i made this from an old sinetology -- scientology emeter .
i do n't need it anymore .
this we are where needle measures where we are .
as you can see presently we are where we are .
now this we are where we were segment , that is experience .
it can not be questioned because we 're not there .
[ laughter ] that 's why they call this experience like ex-wife .
[ laughter ] it does n't make sense to ask mccain where he will take us when we are where we will be because we 're not there either .
okay .
we are -- we are where we are .
this is where mccain says we can question him .
re-- we can question him only in the pastless tense futureless present .
this instantly slim slice of existence , this zero dimensional plot point of the now where eternity intersects time .
if that is what he is saying , the question is not senator how did you vote or senator when will we withdraw but senator mccain , are you high ?
[ laughter ] and that 's the word .
we 'll be right back .
[ cheers and applause ]
Microsoft is buying when Yahoo is at its nadir rather than when it was ridiculously overvalued .
Besides , when you think about it , what other company might make Microsoft ’s short list to buy to stay in the game with Google .
AOL ?
Spare me .
Microsoft founder Bill Gates offered California - based Yahoo !
An unsolicited takeover offer of $ 44.6 billion in its boldest bid yet to challenge Google Inc. ’s dominance of the lucrative online search and advertising markets .
The offer – made when Yahoo ’s share price had reached a two - year low – will be hard for Yahoo ’s board to resist because the company ’s financial outlook does n’t instill much confidence .
Luckily for Microsoft , it is probably paying half what it would ’ve had to shell out a year ago , which is the main reason we ’re seeing it .
Leading members of the committee scheduled a hearing on Friday after Microsoft offer .
Microsoft and Google are locked in the equivalent of an “ arms race ” building up computing and storage capacity to accommodate more and more of the world ’s web - based computing activities .
Microsoft ’s bid to acquire Yahoo !
is certainly one of the largest technology mergers we ’ve seen and presents important issues regarding the competitive landscape of the Internet .
Indeed Yahoo needs Microsoft ’s protection and resources simply to as a brand , while Microsoft needs Yahoo ’s Web - savvy to help it keep up with the ever quickening metabolism of high - tech .
Read
The committee will hear from experts who will weigh in on whether this proposed consolidation works to further or undermine the fundamental principles of a competitive Internet .
Yahoo !
has yet to say whether it will accept the offer , but analysts believe it is too good a deal for the struggling Internet veteran to refuse and those regulators are unlikely to find grounds to stop it .
The deal could reshape the landscape for high technology by combining Microsoft and one of the leading brands on the Internet .
The move comes as Yahoo ! is losing ground rapidly in the Internet space to Google , a search leader which has cashed in on the market for online advertising .
Yahoo ! would offer Microsoft a search engine to compete with Google ’s ; a popular web portal for email , shopping and news , as well as one of the most recognized brands among online users .
Google is also ramping up offerings of on - demand online software that compete with Microsoft products .
Google is moving more and more into Microsoft ’s territory and it was about time Microsoft went on the offensive .
Microsoft and Yahoo !
websites combined get 15.6 per cent of all online traffic in the while Google gets 7.7 pc of Internet visits in the country .
Will this be big enough to beat Google ?
Fears of a looming recession could batter US stocks this week as investors weigh a dim earnings outlook for 2008 against a view that holds shares are cheap as seen by Microsoft ’s $ 44.6 billion bid for Yahoo .
The main sword hanging over the market is the probability that we either are or slipping into a recession .
“ My sense is that the market is going to go lower , that we ’re going to retest the lows of last week … and eventually I think we ’re going to break them . ”
Stocks rose in volatile trade on Friday on optimism over stock valuations after Microsoft ’s takeover offer for Internet Company Yahoo .
The bid is a 62 per cent premium over Yahoo ’s share price on Nasdag before the deal was announced .
What the market would feel comfortable with is flat earnings .
We ’ve been in a earnings recession .
That ’s where you can find your opportunities .
New Orleans ' homeless rate swells to 1 in 25
NEW ORLEANS 
The homeless population of New Orleans since Hurricane Katrina has reached unprecedented levels for a U.S. city : one in 25 residents .
An estimated 12,000 homeless accounts for 4 % of New Orleans ' estimated population of 302,000 , according to the homeless advocacy group UNITY of Greater New Orleans .
The number is nearly double the pre-Katrina homeless count , the group says .
The New Orleans ' rate is more than four times that of most U.S. cities , which have homeless populations of under 1 % , said Michael Stoops , executive director of the Washington - based National Coalition for the Homeless .
The cities with homeless rates closest to that of New Orleans are Atlanta ( 1.4 % ) and Washington ( 0.95 % ) , he said .
A USA TODAY 2005 survey of 460 localities showed one in 400 Americans on average were homeless .
New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin appealed to federal lawmakers this past week to provide funds and housing vouchers to help the city 's homeless problem .
The percentage of New Orleans ' homeless is one of the highest recorded since U.S. housing officials began tracking homelessness in the mid-1980s , said Dennis Culhane , a University of Pennsylvania professor who has studied homeless trends for more than 20 years .
" In a modern urban U.S. city , we 've never seen it , " he said of New Orleans ' homeless rate .
Many of the homeless are Katrina evacuees who returned to unaffordable rents or who slipped through the cracks of the federal system designed to provide temporary housing after the storm , said Mike Miller , UNITY 's director of supportive housing placement .
There are also out - of - state workers who came for the post - Katrina rebuilding boom but lost their jobs , and mentally ill residents in need of services and medication , he said .
Many of the city 's outreach homeless centers and public mental health services have been closed since Katrina .
Nagin has pledged to move the homeless from encampments around the city to more permanent shelters .
Last year , the city and humanitarian groups found shelter for nearly all of the 250 people living in an encampment across from City Hall .
Nagin has suggested reinstating a city ordinance that would make it illegal to sleep in public places .
Homeless advocates say the law would just crowd the jails .
" It just shows a real disconnect " between the city and the problem , said James Perry , head of the Greater New Orleans Fair Housing Action Center .
" The answer is not going to be jails . "
The Supreme Court of Canada has agreed to hear arguments about the legality of the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo , where Canadian Omar Khadr is being held .
The high court ruled yesterday that it could consider submissions on whether Guantanamo violates international law , dismissing the federal government 's objections that the Canadian courts were not the place to examine the actions of the United States .
" In essence , the respondent ( Khadr ) wants the court to preside over a trial of the Guantanamo trials , " the government argued in its submission .
" The court should refuse this invitation . "
Khadr is now the sole Western detainee remaining at Guantanamo , and Canada has come under international pressure to demand his repatriation .
Now 21 , Khadr was 15 when he was shot and captured in Afghanistan in July 2002 and accused of throwing a grenade that killed Delta Force soldier Christopher Speer .
The Pentagon has charged him with five war crimes , including " murder in violation of the laws of war . "
The Supreme Court has already scheduled a hearing for Wednesday , in which the central questions are whether Khadr 's lawyers are entitled to evidence from Canada that could help in his defence at Guantanamo and if the Canadian officials who travelled to the base to interrogate him in 2003 and 2004 breached his constitutional rights .
But in hearing arguments about whether Khadr 's rights were violated in Guantanamo , the court agreed in its unanimous ruling yesterday that it could consider the actions of American officials and the conditions at the U.S.
Navy base in Cuba , which in essence also puts Guantanamo Bay on trial .
" Canadians should be pleased about that because regardless of what the court decides , I do n't think anyone can question that the Supreme Court has a role in overseeing government action , in particular something as important as the rights and freedoms of a Canadian who has been imprisoned abroad , " said Michael Byers , who holds a Canada Research Chair in global politics and international law .
" The larger issue at stake is whether or not the Canadian government can continue to get away with an apparent – not only disregard for the rights of a Canadian citizen – but also alleged complicity in his plight .
This is why we have the checks and balances of a democratic system with an independent judiciary . "
The court also rejected the government 's bid to block human rights groups from raising points of international law in their intervention in the case .
University of Toronto law professor Audrey Macklin , who will represent the university 's law clinic and Human Rights Watch at the hearing , said the court 's rulings on these points may force the government to defend its actions .
" Certainly , what the Supreme Court of Canada says about the legality of Guantanamo Bay and the actions of Canadian officials with respect to a citizen there , will reverberate in the political sphere in terms of bringing greater attention to , and a requirement of justification by the government of Canada about why it refuses to intervene , " Macklin said .
Canada sent agents from the Canadian Security Intelligence Service and an official with the intelligence division in the foreign affairs department to interrogate Khadr in the two years after his capture .
The purpose of the visits was to collect intelligence , since the U.S. would not permit consular visits for detainees .
Khadr 's Canadian lawyers , Dennis Edney and Nathan Whitling , have argued that these interrogations – and turning over the information gleaned by the Canadians to U.S. officials – violated Khadr 's constitutional rights .
They also argue that the government 's refusal now to hand over the complete notes from the interrogations further breaches his right to fair trial .
Washing fresh fruits and vegetables — even with chlorine disinfectants — may not be enough to rid them of certain bacteria that cause food poisoning , say researchers , who found that irradiating the food is the most successful means of killing microbes .
E. coli , salmonella and listeria can all cause illnesses , but destroying the bugs can be problematic , said microbiologist Brendan Niemira , lead investigator of a study looking at ways to make fresh produce safer for consumers .
Eliminating bacteria is difficult if they have made their way inside the leaves of lettuce , spinach and other vegetables and fruit , where surface treatments cannot reach them , said Niemira , who presented his findings Thursday at the American Chemical Society annual meeting in New Orleans .
Destroying E. coli and other food - borne pathogens can be even more difficult if the bacteria are lurking within biofilms — tightly knit communities that coat fruits and vegetables and protect the microbes from harm , he said .
Even humans harbour biofilm : that sticky substance that coats our teeth and gums is one example , said Niemira , lead scientist of the Produce Safety Research Project for the U.S. Department of Agriculture 's eastern region .
In fact , up to 100 or more different types of bacteria can live together within a biofilm , which protects them from the environment .
Niemira 's group wanted to know if they could use irradiation to destroy disease - causing bacteria that had taken up residence inside vegetable leaves or within biofilms .
" The answer is : Yes , you can , " he said .
" Based on my studies , the basic punch line is if you have E. coli inside a lettuce leaf where chlorine can't kill it , irradiation will . "
Irradiation to bump off microbes in food — including meat , eggs and produce — is for the most part not allowed in Canada ( imported spices are one exception ) .
The U.S. permits irradiation of some foods , including certain meat products , but the FDA is reviewing whether to add fresh produce to that list .
Electron beams destroy pathogens , insects
The process exposes food to a source of electron beams that inactivates parasites and destroys pathogens and insects , depending on the dose .
Using this technique on fresh and fresh - cut fruits and vegetables could provide a reliable way to reduce cases of food - borne illnesses reported each year in North America , Niemira said .
Concern over pathogens increased following two outbreaks of E. coli disease in the United States in 2006 due to contamination of U.S. - grown spinach and lettuce .
The tainted produce sickened about 275 people in all , killing three .
Fresh fruits and vegetables carry the risk of contamination because most are grown in open fields with exposure to microbes from soil , irrigation water , manure , wildlife or other sources .
To conduct the study , Niemira 's lab cut leaves of romaine lettuce and baby spinach into pieces and submerged them in a mixture containing E. coli .
The bacteria were pushed inside the leaves with a vacuum perfusion process and the leaves then were treated with either a three - minute water wash , a three - minute chemical treatment or irradiation .
The researchers found washing with plain water was ineffective at reducing E. coli levels in either spinach or lettuce .
The chemical treatment did not cause a significant drop in bacteria in spinach leaves , and gave less than a 90 per cent reduction in the romaine lettuce .
Ionizing radiation cut E. coli by 99.9 %
However , ionizing radiation significantly cut the E. coli population in both spinach and lettuce leaves , with reductions of about 99.9 per cent .
Irradiation was also able to kill salmonella and E. coli within biofilms .
The use of irradiation is n't without controversy .
A number of consumer activist organizations have long lobbied against its use in foods , arguing the process damages food quality , destroys vitamins and enzymes and can create toxins .
Dr. Keith Warriner , a food microbiologist at the University of Guelph , said long - term studies of food irradiation show it poses no risk to human health .
But some people associate it with radiation from nuclear bombs , he said from Guelph , Ont .
" The reality of the situation is irradiation is perfectly safe .
It 's just got a bit of a bad press through the years . "
Warriner advises consumers to keep most produce refrigerated , especially green leafy vegetables , and wash them thoroughly under running water before eating .

DemocracyForNewHampshire.com — Speech to the NH House on Impeachment resolution
Editor ’s note : Representative Hall ’s speech on the House floor last week is posted here in its entirety .
Unfortunately , her colleagues never heard the whole speech , because she was interrupted by hoots and howls , and because the Speaker of the House also interrupted her .
NH Secretary Gardner reminded us all at DemocracyFest that , according to our first President , George Washington , democracy demands that we “ extend our views beyond ourselves ” .
Thank you Representative Hall , for the attempt to do just that .
And shame on your colleagues for not honoring your patriotism and for preventing you from doing so .
Why now ?
Why NOW ?
That ’s the question I have been asked constantly since I made the request for late introduction of a Resolution to Petition the U.S. House of Representatives to Commence Impeachment Procedures .
I based this request to our Rules Committee on House Rules which specifically provide for late introduction after the deadline if approved by the House Rules Committee or a 2/3 vote of the House .
The Rules Committee in its wisdom voted ( and I understand their reasoning ) not to allow the introduction and I am before you today asking this House in its wisdom to allow the introduction of this resolution .
The resolution I will propose if this motion passes has been drafted by me and is based on the resolution introduced by Representative Perry at the Democratic State Convention in June of 2006 .
It passed overwhelmingly even though the Resolutions Committee of the Convention in their wisdom did NOT recommend it .
Impeachment Resolutions have been introduced in this House before .
I was a member of this House when President Nixon was facing the impeachment and Franklin mayor and House colleague , Eugene Danielle introduced an impeachment resolution .
It was one of the first to be introduced in the country and Danielle gave an impassioned speech .
I wish I was the orator he was .
I have talked with at least three members of this House today who were members then and they remember that speech .
It was a very rousing speech and at the end of the speech we had a standing vote .
Some remember 11 courageous people stood up and voted for the resolution .
I was very moved but I failed to stand up .
At least one member today who was a member then stood up .
I have always been ashamed that I did not stand .
I believe we HAVE TO STAND UP FOR WHAT IS RIGHT , NOT WHAT IS WINNABLE .
This is why I believe so strongly NOW is the time to stand up .
At least ten other legislatures are reportedly considering the urgency of acting now .
I believe there is a compelling need to start the ball rolling NOW .
Waiting for the regular process which has been urged by many I respect will put the schedule behind by six months .
The people are angry ” ” they want action now .
They are angry with Congress as well .
The polls affirm this conclusion .
They are angry because we are not moving fast enough to stop the Iraq war .
Because the war puts our finest young soldiers in harms way , many of our grassroots people have concluded that Congress and the Military , and our Chief Executives have failed in all the arenas listed in the Resolution to Petition Congress .
They are afraid that our Chief Executives are still leading us down the path of shock and awe , lies , and deadly assault .
Our wonderful troops are being unfairly strained already .
How can we sustain a broadening of the conflict to another country ?
Iran is an absolutely pressing concern , today , tomorrow , the next day .
Can we really afford the same mistakes in Iran ?
Everything I understand by reading the Declaration of Independence and our Constitution sets forth principles by which we the people must act when a situation develops such as we face at this momentous moment .
We have a failure of leadership .
I mean ALL leadership .
Both parties and the three branches of government bear responsibility .
Each citizen bears the responsibility also .
If citizens fail to act we are just as doomed as the Germans were when Hitler was allowed to come to power .
They let it happen .
I know because I was there .
When all else fails , the Constitution provides for impeachment and removal from office .
Republicans thought that point of failure happened and impeached President Clinton , and my party thought that happened and both parties forced the resignation of President Nixon when it become obvious he would be impeached .
Frankly , I would prefer resignations rather than impeachments as a result of this resolution .
No one wants to go through the gut wrenching of impeachment and trial .
I want new leadership immediately .
Resignations would be the fastest and best .
Nobody thought Nixon would resign , but he did .
I think even worse could happen were impeachment not introduced because that could set a precedent for future generations and future presidents .
Would you want any one of the Democratic Presidential hopefuls to have the power to do what President Bush and Vice President Cheney have done ?
Would you want any one of them to commit any of the impeachable offenses listed below , and not be held accountable ?
Would I want any one of your hopefuls to carry on the offenses into the next term ?
Even if you yourself do n’t think the offenses are impeachable , are n’t they serious enough to find out through investigation and testimony ?
I think we need to have this discourse once again to purge our system when it goes as far awry as I think it has .
I think the sooner the discourse starts , the sooner we can start saving lives .
Even if it were to start Wednesday , there is no assurance where it will go , and if it does n’t start until September , there will still be no assurances .
But history teaches us that the American people will not ignore our Constitution and Declaration of Independence .

The American media , already not much more than a shill for the corporate and political elites with little spine or stomach for genuine confrontation with power , has now abandoned its obligation as the representatives of the fourth estate .
They have , in their search for ' ratings ' and ' content ' , or perhaps in complicity with those who seek to prolong the Iraq war , completely overlooked one of the most significant veteran 's protests since the Vietnam war .
It is the Winter Soldier II conference sponsored by the IVAW ( Iraq Vets Against the War )
which is a gather of over 200 veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan
conflicts who have come not simply to speak about the war but also to
tell their personal stories and to share their pain and internal
conflict about the nature of these wars .
It has not been covered by
the MSM .
When one does a Google news search for " Winter Soldier II "
there are no hits from the MSM on the first page , though the first hit
is about an article from Human Events , the conservative standard
bearer .
In fact the first even close to mainstream outlet to cover it
is the Des Moines Register , and they 're only important during the Iowa
caucuses .
When I searched directly on the MSM websites , both CNN and
the " liberal " NY Times had no coverage .
The closest they came was a
few articles on John Kerry and the original Winter Soldier
conference after Vietnam from the 2004 election .
The only large media
outlets to have coverage were Yahoo ! news and MSNBC , though even that
was an article sourced from the Washington Post .

They have now become a completely owned and operated wing of the
asshole party .
They will cover Kerry 's involvment in the first Winter
Soldier as a huge controversy 30 years later even though it turned out
those boys were all telling the absolute truth , but not a similar
conference going on right now about a war thats going on right now
because I guess it conflicts with the interests of their advertisers
( though why Dove soap cares about the Iraq war I 'll never know ) .
And
since the media is granted its freedoms to protect the interests of the
third estate ( the people ) , and they have now become a subsidiary of the
second estate ( in old Europe that was the landed gentry and
aristocracy ) they no longer need to be protected from the law since
they represent it .
We need new media .
Not just blogs and little
outlets , but major media sources which millions of people who do n't
know how to use the internet can access .
There is no other way to
combat this assault on our freedom by the press .
But who among us with
the resources will be strong enough to find such an outlet ?
So far the
closest is PBS ' Bill Moyers , but even he barely makes a dent in the
viewers of CNN or MSNBC or Limbaugh or Savage or Malkin .
Without a
truly free and cynical fourth estate , I do n't know if our democracy can
survive .

2008 is the year for Linux
This spring , the stoner screwball movie of 2004 , “ Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle , ” will get a sequel .
This time , because of some unfortunate confusion on an airplane between a “ bong ” and a “ bomb , ” our slacker antiheroes are shipped off to the moviemakers ’ idea of the worst prison imaginable .
On April 25 , on a screen near you : “ Harold and Kumar Escape From Guantánamo Bay . ”
Seriously , dude .
Six years after the detention camp opened on Cuban shores , officials in Washington continue to consider its fate .
The charges filed last Monday against six detainees in connection with the Sept. 11 attacks are renewing international focus on the prison and the policy discussion about whether it is part of the solution or part of the problem .
But in popular culture , the debate about Guantánamo is largely over , as suggested by a look at a growing number of novels , nonfiction books , movies , plays and other forms of expression .
“ Whether it ’s America ’s Devil ’s Island or not , that ’s how people are going to keep thinking about it , ” said Dan Fesperman , a former Baltimore Sun reporter who set his 2006 mystery novel “ The Prisoner of Guantánamo ” at the base .
A VIOLENT thug attacking a shopkeeper never expected to come face - to - face with a superhero .
But as Gerard Smith went `berserk ' in a Manchester newsagents , passer - by Kevin Godin - Prior lifted his jumper to reveal a Spiderman costume and told him : " You do n't know who you 're dealing with . "
Have - a- go - hero Kevin was on his way to a charity fundraiser dressed as the cult comic character when he called at the shop in Gorton .
As he walked in , he saw Smith lashing out and abusing the shopkeeper .
Kevin , 53 , revealed his secret identity , fought off a series of attacks and then forced Smith outside , refusing to let go until the police arrived .
" He was threatening the shopkeeper and abusing him , " said mortgage consultant Kevin .
" He was being a drunken yob .
I tried to cajole him out of the shop , but he rushed me and banged my head against a display cabinet .
" He tried to throttle me , but I managed to detain him outside until the police came .
" I would n't let him go .
I just stayed with him until he was run ragged . "
Father - of - two Kevin went to hospital with injuries to his head and neck , but was n't seriously hurt .
He added : " I just happened to be going out to a charity event - which I do quite a lot - and I had on my Spiderman costume .
" I just managed to get free from his grip because he had been trying to throttle me .
" I said to him : ` You 've made a big mistake here , mate .
You do n't know who you are dealing with ' .
" Then I lifted the jumper .
His jaw just dropped when he saw the Spiderman outfit .
But he still decided to come at me .
It was quite a sustained attack . "
When police arrived they arrested Smith , 42 , of Elsdon Drive , Gorton .
At Manchester magistrates court , Smith pleaded guilty to two charges of assault in the shop on Hyde Road on February 23 - on Kevin and on a woman .
Smith was ordered to carry out a 12 - month community punishment order , pay each victim £ 250 and pay the court £ 300 costs .
Kevin said : " I simply did what felt to be right at the time , as safely as I could for me and the others .
" This guy needs to be kept off the streets and straightened out , along with all the other drunks and yobs who make life a misery for decent people .
" I hope this inspires others to do the same - carefully - rather than back out . "
Kevin was nominated for an M.E.N - sponsored Neighbourhood Spirit Award in 2004 for his citizen arrests .
It is thought he has made in the region of 30 citizen arrests over the years .
He has clung to the bonnet of a car to try to stop a hit - and - run driver escaping and has also chased gangs of youths trying to steal cars near his home .
This car is not entirely new – it was first unveiled at last year 's SEMA show – but it bears repeated viewing .
Designed by the Huntington Beach , California firm Five Axis , this Yaris is meant to be an homage to the sixties - era Toyota 7 racecar , and it's outfitted with Sparco racing gear on the inside and a vintage ivory white paintjob and assymetrical racestripe on the outside .
It seats only one person , preferably someone who is not easily embarrassed .
When Charles Riegel underwent surgery after a heart attack in 1996 , no one could have guessed that his operation would lead to a Supreme Court decision that could affect the safety of patients across the US .
During surgery , an inflatable catheter designed to open Riegel ’s coronary artery ruptured , leaving him severely injured .
Riegel and his wife sued Medtronic , the manufacturer of the device , but defence lawyers argued that the firm could not be held responsible as the catheter had been approved by the Food and Drug Administration .
Last week , the Supreme Court agreed , saying that this ruled out legal action . …
Scientists tell us that our prehistoric ancestor Homo Habilis , as he stood high atop a cliff thoughtfully chewing a great mouthful of Ancient Grains brand cereal , often stared up at the sky and wondered :
Where can I hide my ammo and health ?
Obviously , he used different words , probably something like " Where Homo Habilis hide Homo Habilis ' ammo and health ? " , but the problem remains the same even today .
Another eternal question - in the sense that it was first posed in the subjective eternity between when Paul Steed opens his mouth to make human - like talking sounds and when he finally decides to shut up - is how can a game be judged objectively without the vagueness and potential bias towards Unreal Tournament that has always tainted the traditional , but imperfect , art of opinion - giving ?
Game developers have known the answer to the first question since the early 1980's : ammo and health can be hidden inside crates or sometimes barrels .
As often happens , the answer to the second question was hidden in plain sight within the answer to the first .
All games contain crates , therefore all games can be judged empirically on those crates .
Upcoming Todd McFarlane " Heroes of Videogames " crate & barrel action figures .
Spider sold separately .
Once we came up with that insight , the actual formula for the world 's first completely unbiased review methodology was a trivial matter of applying our many hours spent watching actors portray scientists on television to our hatred of crates .
Games can be rated and compared based on the shortest amount of time it takes a player to reach the first crate , which represents the point where the developers ran out of ideas .
This number is measured in seconds and is called " Start to Crate " or " StC " .
The smaller the StC , the worse the game .
To test our theory , we installed and played the twenty - six games we had within easy reach of where we were sitting .
To our scientific delight , all exhibited crates within the first one hundred and twenty seconds of play .
Please note that by crates , we mean both crates proper and the circular crate , the barrel .
In the interest of scoring some points with our peers in science , such as our new colleague Dr. Jonas Salk , we 've utilized all of the components of the very popular scientific method , including the notion of a control group .
Our initial control group was this picture of Paul Steed 's head digitally imaged onto the body of a chubby waiter at the Lebanese Hooters :
We asked a fellow scientist at Case Western Reserve University here in Cleveland to peer review our experiment .
He had some difficult - to - understand , but serious - sounding concerns regarding our control group .
In response to his generally negative tone , we put Steed 's head on a much fatter body and gave him a little cowboy hat :
With our control group finally in place , all we needed was a research assistant and a microscope .
After a brief search , we narrowed the field of potential assistants down to two candidates : Dr. Stephen Hawking and our friend Kevin .
While Hawking is a TV star like Allie McBeal , owns his own microscope , and sounds like a robot , Kevin is the only one of the two who talks to us , making him the winner by one degree Kelvin .
That still left us without a microscope .
Kevin validated our choice of him over Dr. Hawking by helpfully suggesting that we eliminate step 4 of our scientific review procedure , " Look at the game through a microscope " , and we were off .

Merrill Lynch Still Pricing Most Auction - Rates At Par
NEW YORK -( Dow Jones ) - Merrill Lynch & Co. ( MER ) , taking a different tack from UBS AG ( UBS ) , told its brokers Monday afternoon that most clients ' holdings of auction - rate securities will not be priced at a discount in their March statements .
Merrill Lynch said statements with prices for the securities would be posted Monday night , and could be viewed by clients with online access to statements .
UBS decided last week to price clients ' holdings of the securities at a discount to reflect clients ' inability to sell the securities due to failures in regularly scheduled auctions .
Previously , clients , though unable to sell the securities , were told they were valued at par .
Merrill 's decision to continue pricing most of the securities at par could hold off an eruption of anger from clients who are already frustrated at being unable to sell their securities .
But it carries the risk of being criticized for ignoring a common practice of discounting illiquid securities .
In a conference call with Merrill brokers , a Merrill official said the firm would continue to use third - party pricing services to value auction - rate securities and that most of the securities will be priced at par .
The firm did n't tell brokers what percentage of the securities might be priced at a discount , but it said any discounts would n't be large .
UBS officials said Friday they used an internal model in deciding to price them at a discount .
The markdowns will range from a few percentage points to more than 20 .
Marten Hoekstra , head of UBS Wealth Management Americas , earlier said more than 90 % of the securities are below 100 % , but more than two - thirds of these securities valued subpar are valued at 97 % or better .
Brokerages have long marketed auction - rate securities , commonly issued by municipalities , universities and closed - end funds , as liquid , super - safe investments with interest rates slightly superior to conventional money - market funds .
Investors , who range from big institutions to wealthy individuals , hold more than $ 300 billion in the long - term securities that carry short - term interest rates because the rates reset every seven to 35 days .
Until recently , the securities could be bought at regular auctions supervised by large Wall Street firms including UBS , Citigroup Inc. ( C ) , Merrill Lynch and others .
The system , which had worked well for years , suddenly seized up in February when the big banks , concerned about their balance sheets , stopped committing their own money to make sure auctions ran smoothly .
The inability to sell the securities has led to consternation and anger among investors .
Although the frozen auctions mean these investors receive more attractive interest rates , many feel frustrated they have been unable to sell investments that they say were explained to them as safe and liquid .
Some of the securities , moreover , have strict limits on how much the interest payments can increase .
Resolving the situation could take months , Sallie Krawcheck , head of Citigroup 's Wealth Management Business , told investors on a conference call Monday afternoon .
The conference call did n't address pricing , an investor on the call said .
During the call , Citigroup executives told investors that about 40 % of auctions were succeeding , allowing some auction - rate investors to exit their holdings .
The easiest securities to sell are typically those issued by municipalities with the highest penalty rates , according to Citigroup .
Securities issued by closed - end funds and student - loan authorities have been much trickier to unload .
Issuers that pay substantial penalties also have the strongest incentive to refinance their securities , essentially buying them back from investors .
Citigroup estimated that up to $ 2 billion in auction - rate securities were being restructured each week , and that up to $ 100 billion could be restructured over the next nine to 12 months .
Merrill Lynch officials said on the call to brokers that the firm is working to find ways customers can eventually sell their holdings at par .

The thesis for this article is simple ; get drunk seven times and for each hangover , try a different ‘ cure ’ and report back on its effectiveness .
Using science as an excuse to get tanked on booze has always been a dream of ours at the JAGT HQ , which is why writing this article was all the more satisfying .
The thesis is simple ; get drunk seven times and for each hangover , try a different ‘ cure ’ and report back on its effectiveness .
Our subject is a 25 year old male who has experienced some decline in his ability to recover quickly from a hangover .
Let ’s see what Wikipedia says he has to look forward to :
A hangover is associated with a variety of symptoms that may include dehydration , fatigue , headache , nausea , vomiting , diarrhea , weakness , elevated body temperature , hypersalivation , difficulty concentrating , anxiety , irritability , sensitivity to light and noise , erratic motor functions , and trouble sleeping .
Many people will also be repulsed by the thought or taste of alcohol during a hangover .
The symptoms vary from person to person , and occasion to occasion , usually beginning several hours after drinking .
Looking at the extensive list of hangover symptoms only makes our relationship with beer all the more bittersweet .
Let ’s get stuck into the experiment and see how our subject got on .
Hangover Cure # 1 –
The hair of the dog
The Myth
The colloquial English phrase “ the hair of the dog that bit you ” actually suggests alcohol itself as a form of treatment for a hangover .
Scientifically , there is evidence that a hangover is not only the body removing toxins but also the body ’s reaction to withdrawal of alcohol .
The Reality
“ After a heavy night drinking , I wake up with a splitting headache and smelling like Robert Downey Jr. before rehab .
The thought of drinking more alcohol is unbearable as the nausea sets in .
Grudgingly , I crack open a bottle of Budweiser and sit , shaking , in my underwear as I sip the golden nectar in the interests of science .
After 30 minutes I start to feel a lot better .
Out comes another bottle and this one goes down a lot smoother than before .
It ’s not even 9 am yet and temptation has me craving a third bottle of beer .
I resist , and although I feel pretty good now it ’s only a matter of time before the familiar symptoms creep back to ruin my day . ”
The Conclusion
After trying the hair of the dog , our subject reported that he actually began to feel better .
His headache subsided and the feeling of nausea passed .
Unfortunately , once he ’d finished drinking the symptoms came back just as strongly in the afternoon .
By drinking a couple of beers he had merely delayed the inevitable .
Now , if he had mixed himself a Bloody Mary , it might have been a different story .
Hangover Cure # 2 – A big greasy breakfast
The Myth
Here in England , ask anyone what the best hangover cure is and it ’s very likely that they ’ll say , “ A big greasy fry up . ”
A fry up , also known as a Full English Breakfast is a traditionally cooked meal which is served in the morning and will include most of the following :
* Toast or fried bread
* Fried bacon
* Fried egg
* Sausages
* Fried or tinned tomatoes
* Fried mushrooms
* Baked beans
* Hash browns
* HP brown sauce and / or ketchup
While not exactly good for your heart , it is said that a full English can “ soak up the alcohol ” .
The Reality
“ My head feels like I ’ve been in a train wreck and to say my stomach is a little delicate would be an understatement .
I do n’t really feel like eating but the smell of the fried egg and bacon gets me salivating and my taste buds are on red alert .
I apply a liberal amount of HP brown sauce to my bacon , sausage , eggs , baked beans , hash browns and tinned tomatoes and get stuck in like I have n’t eaten in weeks !
To cap off a fantastic breakfast I wash the food down with a strong cup of tea .
Half an hour after the breakfast , my nausea has all but vanished .
My head , while still throbbing , does n’t pound anywhere near as much as it did before I ate and any lethargy I felt when waking up has been replaced by a sudden surge of energy . ”
The Conclusion
A pretty good result for this cure .
The headache did n’t completely disappear but it subsided , along with nausea and laziness !
Perhaps the Full English Breakfast really does soak up alcohol after all ?
Hangover Cure # 3 – Exercise
The Myth
There is no denying that a workout makes you feel good .
The endorphins are flowing , you clear your mind and your blood pumps through your veins .
But is this a good idea after a heavy drinking session ?
Science states that exercise after a night on the tiles helps the heart pump blood around the body and increases the amount of oxygen in your body too .
This , supposedly , flushes the impure toxins of the booze out of your system .
The Reality
“ After arriving at the gym , I spend about ten minutes at the water cooler trying not to be sick psyching myself up .
With plenty of water to hand , I finally get on and start at a light , steady pace .
Surprisingly , my stamina is actually better than usual .
I ’m sweating like a nun in a cucumber patch but enjoying every second of the workout !
After 30 minutes of moderate jogging I decide to call it a day .
The walk home is borderline euphoric .
If only I ’d known that working out after a skinful was this rewarding ; I would be built like a Greek god by now .
A few hours after the gym however , my head is pounding and I feel exhausted and weak .
My euphoric high has now been replaced with a depressive low .
So much for the gym being the answer to my alcoholic prayers . ”
The Conclusion
Working out seems to be a short term solution to the problem , but is the immense high of working out when you ’re already dehydrated worth the physical risks and the manic low experienced by our test subject ?
Our verdict : no .
Hangover Cure # 4 – Drinking water
The Myth
Although technically a prevention rather than a remedy , drinking water before going to bed is the most common way to prevent a hangover from occurring .
The science behind this is simple ; excessive drinking leaves your body dehydrated .
Replenishing your body by drinking water is the logical way to counteract this .
Let ’s see if it worked .
The Reality
“ After ten pints and a couple of shots , I stumble home in a drunken stupor .
I almost head straight for bed before I remember there is something I ’m supposed to do .
What the hell is it ?
Oh yes , I need to drink lots and lots of water .
I grab my ‘ Worlds Greatest Lover ’ pint glass and fill it with water .
Somehow a pool of water appears on the floor too .
Never mind , the girlfriend will sort that out .
I refill three times and force the non-alcoholic liquid down my throat .
I feel bloated and sleepy .
I burp quickly before heading to bed .
The next morning I wake up at 9 am and lie there for a moment .
No nausea , no lethargy , a very slight headache but nothing I can’t handle .
‘ It ’s a miracle ! ’
I proclaim as I get out of bed .
Oh no …. dizziness sets in and I lose my balance and bounce against the wardrobe door .
It passes quickly but now the headache is more noticeable .
I do n’t feel terrible , but I do n’t feel great either . ”
The Conclusion
There is no questioning that drinking plenty of water both during , and after , your drinking session will be of great benefit the morning after .
Our subject suffered slight dizziness and lack of balance , but after ten pints and a few shots , this is actually quite a good result .
Hangover Cure # 5 –
Over the counter hangover pills
The Myth
Over the counter dietary supplement RU - 21 contains the active ingredient succinic acid , an extract of amber .
The penis enlargement internet marketers have jumped on the bandwagon and now tout the pill as a miracle cure for alcohol hangovers .
Supposedly developed by Soviet scientists for the KGB , this ‘ wonder drug ’ apparently metabolizes the alcohol in your body .
Urban legend says that it was intended for use by KGB spies to drink heavily with suspected Western spies so that they could remain sober and potentially obtain secrets from their drunken counterparts .
When that did n’t work , tests showed it could lessen a hangover .
Let ’s see .
The Reality
“ I had decided beforehand that to fully test this pill I ’d need to drink more alcohol than I had ever drunk in my life before .
Heading to the local watering hole I started gradually with a couple of bottles of Corona and lime .
Then I downed two pints of Carling lager before my mate came over and challenged me to pick up the pace .
Necking a double vodka and coke I summoned the barman to provide me with two shots of tequila and a beer to wash it down .
Amidst this I was popping the odd ‘ dietary pill ’ and drawing concerned looks from the locals .
Stepping up a gear I drank , in quick succession , a depth charge , two shots of some disgusting apple liquid , an Aftershock and a Southern Comfort and coke .
I finished the evening off with a bottle of Bud and a shot of absinthe .
( I remember everything I drunk because I wrote it down , thankfully )
The next morning I woke up feeling like I ’d been hit in the face by a sledgehammer and proceeded to be ‘ violently ill ’ in the bathroom .
This experiment was an absolute disaster and I would gladly accept death to stop the pain . ”
The Conclusion
Upon further research , it is documented that the pill “ is not for binge drinkers ” .
It apparently works best when drinking in moderation .
Call us cynical but is n’t that the kind of drinking that means you barely even get a hangover , thus ensuring that the drug can never be discounted as a placebo , created by a charlatan to take money from the unsuspecting public ?
Hangover Cure # 6 – Back To The Future Wake - Up Juice
The Myth
In Back To The Future : Part 3 , Doc Brown gets smashed on whiskey after losing the love of his life .
Mad Dog Tannen is on his way to six - shoot Marty and the Doc to an early grave and the lovable scientist has passed out at the bar .
The bar tender Chester puts together an antidote to alcohol called wake - up juice .
The BTTF wiki claims this juice includes tabasco sauce , cayenne pepper , chili peppers , onion , and mustard seed .
We bought and blended the ingredients to test out on our unsuspecting subject .
The Reality
“ ‘ What ’s in it ? ’
I ask gingerly as I walk into the kitchen nursing the hangover from hell .
My tormentor just smiles and hits level 3 on the blender .
My head reacts badly and I wince at the sound of the blades liquidizing the blood - red concoction .
After what seems like an eternity I ’m handed a half - pint glass of the most disgusting looking drink I have ever seen in my life .
I feel like a prisoner of war as I ’m instructed to neck the whole thing in one go .
I take a deep breath and fling my head back , gulping down the cocktail of god - knows - what .
At first I feel nothing .
But then , from the bottom of my throat up and into my mouth and my lips , all I feel is heat .
I ’m burning from the inside with a very distinct bitter taste .
I reach for the tap but nothing comes out They cut the taps to ensure the experiment goes as planned !
I gag and heave and after what seems like an eternity I prepare myself for the humiliation of vomiting on the kitchen floor , just as the taps come back on and I engulf my head in water , lapping at the faucet like a dog after a long walk .
Thirty minutes later and the headache still pounds through my skill , my stomach is more volatile than ever and my lips still tingle with the hint of tabasco sauce .
I ’m never drinking again . ”
The conclusion
It seems that with all their millions of dollars , Hollywood can put together some fantastic sets , amazing visual effects and some great guy movies , but they ca n’t create a cure for a hangover .
Hangover Cure # 7 – Vomiting
The Myth
Another prevention which is supposed to be done prior to sleeping , vomiting has been the hangover prevention of choice for frat boys for decades now .
The science says that vomiting is the bodies natural way of getting rid of toxins quickly .
Oh , there is also the slight risk of dehydration and electrolyte imbalances .
Nevertheless , we sent our intrepid subject out to vomit in the name of science .
The Reality
“ After a marathon drinking session which started at the local pub , I began my quest to have a drink ( or two ) in each bar leading into town – a mile long stretch in total – before arriving at a nightclub ten pints later for some serious drinking .
Cue shots of vodka , whiskey , tequila , ouzo , absinthe and Aftershock – all in the name of science .
I do n’t remember getting home , but what I do remember is being wrapped around the toilet for the better part of the night .
I awoke in the morning to find myself sleeping on the floor next to the bed .
I ached but my head felt fine .
My stomach felt pretty solid and I had a big bacon sandwich and cup of coffee to pick me up .
I was feeling great with the only downside being my lack of desire to do anything .
I lay in bed playing XBox and nothing short of a natural disaster was going to get me out of my underpants .
Of course , I ’d rather feel bad than have to clean up the festering mess that still exists in and around the toilet bowl ! ”
The Conclusion
Being sick after a heavy session seems to greatly reduce the effects of a hangover the next morning .
It does n’t reduce the lethargy though and the health risks of regularly making yourself sick means that we recommend leaving self - induced vomiting to Nicole Ritchie and the Olsen twins .
The final hangover summary
Of the seven remedies trialled by our resident guinea pig , we asked him to choose the most effective cure for a hangover .
His answer : A Full English Breakfast .
Now , after all this science mumbo- jumbo we ’re gonna head off and get a few beers , while eating …. a full english breakfast .
In the meantime , drop your best hangover remedies in the comments .
We ca n’t live without the booze , so we might as well share ways to enjoy all of the positives while reducing the negatives .

April 11 , 2008  -- President Bush says he knew his top national security advisers discussed and approved specific details about how high - value al Qaeda suspects would be interrogated by the Central Intelligence Agency , according to an exclusive interview with ABC News Friday .
" Well , we started to connect the dots in order to protect the American people . "
Bush told ABC News White House correspondent Martha Raddatz .
" And yes , I 'm aware our national security team met on this issue .
And I approved . "
As first reported by ABC News Wednesday , the most senior Bush administration officials repeatedly discussed and approved specific details of exactly how high - value al Qaeda suspects would be interrogated by the CIA .
The high - level discussions about these " enhanced interrogation techniques " were so detailed , these sources said , some of the interrogation sessions were almost choreographed -- down to the number of times CIA agents could use a specific tactic .
These top advisers signed off on how the CIA would interrogate top al Qaeda suspects -- whether they would be slapped , pushed , deprived of sleep or subjected to simulated drowning , called waterboarding , sources told ABC news .
The advisers were members of the National Security Council 's Principals Committee , a select group of senior officials who met frequently to advise President Bush on issues of national security policy .
At the time , the Principals Committee included Vice President Dick Cheney , former National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice , Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and Secretary of State Colin Powell , as well as CIA Director George Tenet and Attorney General John Ashcroft .
As the national security adviser , Rice chaired the meetings , which took place in the White House Situation Room and were typically attended by most of the principals or their deputies .
The so - called Principals who participated in the meetings also approved the use of " combined " interrogation techniques -- using different techniques during interrogations instead of using one method at a time -- on terrorist suspects who proved difficult to break , sources said .
Contacted by ABC News , spokesmen for Tenet and Rumsfeld declined to comment about the interrogation program or their private discussions in Principals meetings .
The White House also declined comment on behalf of Rice and Cheney .
Ashcroft could not be reached .
ABC News ' Diane Sawyer sat down with Powell this week for a previously scheduled interview and asked him about the ABC News report .
Powell said that he did n't have " sufficient memory recall " about the meetings and that he had participated in " many meetings on how to deal with detainees . "
Powell said , " I 'm not aware of anything that we discussed in any of those meetings that was not considered legal . "
In his interview with ABC News , Bush said the ABC report about the Principals ' involvement was not so " startling . "
The president had earlier confirmed the existence of the interrogation program run by the CIA in a speech in 2006 .
But before Wednesday 's report , the extraordinary level of involvement by the most senior advisers in repeatedly approving specific interrogation plans -- down to the number of times the CIA could use a certain tactic on a specific al Qaeda prisoner -- had never been disclosed .
Critics at home and abroad have harshly criticized the interrogation program , which pushed the limits of international law and , they say , condoned torture .
Bush and his top aides have consistently defended the program .
They say it is legal and did not constitute torture .
In interview with ABC's Charles Gibson last year , Tenet said : " It was authorized .
It was legal , according to the Attorney General of the United States . "
The discussions and meetings occurred in an atmosphere of great concern that another terror attack on the nation was imminent .
Sources said the extraordinary involvement of the senior advisers in the grim details of exactly how individual interrogations would be conducted showed how seriously officials took the al Qaeda threat .
It started after the CIA captured top al Qaeda operative Abu Zubaydah in spring 2002 in Faisalabad , Pakistan .
When his safe house was raided by Pakistani security forces along with FBI and CIA agents , Zubaydah was shot three times during the gun battle .
At a time when virtually all counterterrorist professionals viewed another attack as imminent -- and with information on al Qaeda scarce -- the detention of Zubaydah was seen as a potentially critical breakthrough .
Zubaydah was taken to the local hospital , where CIA agent John Kiriakou , who helped coordinate Zubaydah 's capture , was ordered to remain at the wounded captive 's side at all times .
" I ripped up a sheet and tied him to the bed , " Kiriakou said .
But after Zubaydah recovered from his wounds at a secret CIA prison in Thailand , he was uncooperative .
" I told him I had heard he was being a jerk , " Kiriakou recalled .
" I said , ' These guys can make it easy on you or they can make it hard . '
It was after that he became defiant . "
The CIA wanted to use more aggressive -- and physical -- methods to get information .
The agency briefed high - level officials in the National Security Council 's Principals Committee , led by then - National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice and including then - Attorney General John Ashcroft , which then signed off on the plan , sources said .
It is unclear whether anyone on the committee objected to the CIA 's plans for Zubaydah .
The CIA has confirmed Zubaydah was one of three al Qaeda suspects subjected to waterboarding .
After he was waterboarded , officials say Zubaydah gave up valuable information that led to the capture of 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheik Mohammad and fellow 9/11 plotter Ramzi bin al - Shibh .
Mohammad , who is known as KSM , was also subjected to waterboarding by the CIA .
In the interview with ABC News Friday , Bush defended the waterboarding technique used against KSM .
" We had legal opinions that enabled us to do it , " Bush said .
" And no , I did n't have any problem at all trying to find out what Khalid Sheikh Mohammed knew . "
The president said , " I think it 's very important for the American people to understand who Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was .
He was the person who ordered the suicide attack -- I mean , the 9/11 attacks . "
At a hearing before a military tribunal at Guantanamo Bay March 10 , 2007 , KSM , as he is known , said he broke under the harsh interrogation .
COURT : Were any statements you made as the result of any of the treatment that you received during that time frame from 2003 to 2006 ?
Did you make those statements because of the treatment you receive from these people ?
KSM : Statement for whom ??
COURT : To any of these interrogators . ?
KSM : CIA peoples .
Yes .
At the beginning , when they transferred me ...?
Lawyers in the Justice Department had written a classified memo , which was extensively reviewed , that gave formal legal authority to government interrogators to use the " enhanced " questioning tactics on suspected terrorist prisoners .
The August 2002 memo , signed by then head of the Office of Legal Counsel Jay Bybee , was referred to as the so - called " Golden Shield " for CIA agents , who worried they would be held liable if the harsh interrogations became public .
Old hands in the intelligence community remembered vividly how past covert operations , from the Vietnam War-era " Phoenix Program " of assassinations of Viet Cong to the Iran - Contra arms sales of the 1980s were painted as the work of a " rogue agency " out of control .
But even after the " Golden Shield " was in place , briefings and meetings in the White House to discuss individual interrogations continued , sources said .
Tenet , seeking to protect his agents , regularly sought confirmation from the NSC principals that specific interrogation plans were legal .
According to a former CIA official involved in the process , CIA headquarters would receive cables from operatives in the field asking for authorization for specific techniques .
Agents , worried about overstepping their boundaries , would await guidance in particularly complicated cases dealing with high - value detainees , two CIA sources said .
Highly placed sources said CIA directors Tenet and later Porter Goss along with agency lawyers briefed senior advisers , including Cheney , Rice , Rumsfeld and Powell , about detainees in CIA custody overseas .
" It kept coming up .
CIA wanted us to sign off on each one every time , " said one high - ranking official who asked not to be identified .
" They 'd say , ' We 've got so and so .
This is the plan . ' "
Sources said that at each discussion , all the Principals present approved .
" These discussions were n't adding value , " a source said .
" Once you make a policy decision to go beyond what you used to do and conclude it 's legal , [ you should ] just tell them to implement it . "
Ashcroft was troubled by the discussions .
He agreed with the general policy decision to allow aggressive tactics and had repeatedly advised that they were legal .
But he argued that senior White House advisers should not be involved in the grim details of interrogations , sources said .
According to a top official , Ashcroft asked aloud after one meeting : " Why are we talking about this in the White House ?
History will not judge this kindly . "
The Principals also approved interrogations that combined different methods , pushing the limits of international law and even the Justice Department 's own legal approval in the 2002 memo , sources told ABC News .
At one meeting in the summer of 2003 -- attended by Cheney , among others --
Tenet made an elaborate presentation for approval to combine several different techniques during interrogations , instead of using one method at a time , according to a highly placed administration source .
A year later , amid the outcry over unrelated abuses of Iraqi prisoners at Abu Ghraib , the controversial 2002 legal memo , which gave formal legal authorization for the CIA interrogation program of the top al Qaeda suspects that was leaked to the press .
A new senior official in the Justice Department , Jack Goldsmith , withdrew the legal memo -- the Golden Shield -- that authorized the program .
But the CIA had captured a new al Qaeda suspect in Asia .
Sources said CIA officials that summer returned to the Principals Committee for approval to continue using certain " enhanced interrogation techniques . "
Rice , sources said , was decisive .
Despite growing policy concerns -- shared by Powell -- that the program was harming the image of the United States abroad , sources say she did not back down , telling the CIA : " This is your baby .
Go do it . "
The State of Florida has given a Nestle bottling plant the right to pump as much water as it can get out Madison Blue Springs State Park , which is presently in drought conditions .
The right lasts until 2018 , and cost Nestle $ 230 in permit fees .
Florida is presently in bitter dispute with its neighboring states over a region - wide water - shortage .
The company got a permit to take water belonging to Floridians – hundreds of millions of gallons a year from a spring in a state park – at no cost to Nestle .
No taxes .
No fees .
Just a $ 230 permit to pump water until 2018 …
The state did much more than fight to get Nestle the right to pump as much water as possible from the spring .
As an added incentive for Nestle , the state approved a tax refund of up to $ 1.68 - million for the Madison bottling operation .
To date , Nestle has received two refunds totaling $ 196,000 and requested a third tax refund .

On March 7 , Socialist Party presidential candidate Brian Moore filed a lawsuit in federal court against an Ohio restriction on petitioning .
Moore v Brunner , case number not known yet .
The lawsuit attacks an Ohio law that makes it illegal for someone who is not a registered voter in Ohio , to circulate for an independent candidate .
Ralph Nader had filed a similar lawsuit in 2004 , but the federal courts in Ohio refused to adjudicate the issue for his lawsuit , since the 2004 judges believed that Nader had used out - of - state petitioners , in defiance of the law .
Moore wo n’t have that problem , since he has n’t started petitioning in Ohio .
Ohio law , taken as a whole , is irrational .
It is legal for out - of - staters to circulate a new party petition in Ohio , so there ca n’t possibly be any defense for imposing residency rules for circulators for independent candidates .
Furthermore , Ohio even forces the independent candidate circulators not only to be residents , but to be registered voters in Ohio .
In 1999 the U.S. Supreme Court had struck down laws requiring circulators to be registered voters .

This tiny flesh - eating creature stood no more than a foot tall and barely weighed four and a half pounds .
The first skeleton was discovered by a 14 - year - old hunting for dinosaur bones with his parents in Glacier National Park in Montana .
Scientists named it after Disney 's most famous deer , probably both because it was about the same size as Bambi and because they wanted to shame it for being dead .
Scientists from Yale , the University of Kansas and the University of New Orleans are to blame for giving the cousin of the feared velociraptor such a wuss name .
Pairing " Bambi " with a bad ass word like " raptor " does n't help .
The cute neurons that circle the name Bambi will always overpower any manly name it 's paired up with : Bambi Stallone , Bambibear , Bambi Steak .

The name as a whole just makes you feel more pity than fear .
If you encountered a lone Bambiraptor wandering in the wilderness , you 'd probably think the poor little guy was alone and hungry after some bloodthirsty hunter shot his mother in the name of sportsmanship .
Of course right after you cooed and tickled under it 's jaw , it would jump up and rip out your jugular .

We 're not sure whether or not we should have preserved Scrotum Humanum for the Most Awesome Dinosaur Names article .
So how did it wind up with it ?
It 's kind of a long story .
The first dinosaur bone ever discovered was found in 1676 in a quarry in England .
Several other parts of the dinosaur were found and in 1815 , when William Buckland , Professor of Geology at the University of Oxford , bestowed it the perfectly acceptable name of Megalosaurus , Greek for " great lizard . "
One hundred years later , apparently not satisfied with this perfectly manly sounding name , Richard Brookes named it Scrotum Humanan , because he thought the original bone fragment ( above ) looked like a nutsack .

When naming a leg bone that 's most remarkable feature is that it's too big to be from any known creature , and you decide to go with the fact that it vaguely resembles a pair of balls , we 're guessing that has less to do with the bone and more to do with the time you walked in on your Dad masturbating in the shower .
Technically this is n't the dinosaur 's official name anymore , as it fell into disuse for 50 years , apparently the scientific expiration date for stupid names .
People for some reason have gone back to using Megalosaurus .
We have no idea why .
FORT MYERS , Fla . --
Fans at City of Palms Park were ready for Boston 's final spring training game in Florida .
The Red Sox were n't .
In an extraordinary move , Boston players voted to boycott a nationally televised exhibition and Wednesday afternoon 's flight to Japan for next week 's season - opening series against Oakland , upset that coaches were n't going to receive the same $ 40,000 payments negotiated for players by their union .
A couple of hours later , all was resolved , and the Red Sox took the field one hour late for a 4 - 3 loss to Toronto before a crowd of 7,868 .
Across the country in Phoenix , Athletics players also considered a boycott .
They did n't take batting practice and held five team meetings before following Boston 's lead and deciding to play .
An Oakland split squad lost 6 - 1 to the Los Angeles Angels in front of 7,940 fans before leaving for Tokyo .
" The players just stepped up and they did what I think was right , " Boston bench coach Brad Mills said .
Major League Baseball agreed to pay the managers , coaches and trainers on the trip $ 20,000 each from management 's proceeds , a person familiar with the agreement said , speaking on condition of anonymity because details were n't announced .
The Red Sox agreed to make up the difference to make the amount equal , and to pay some of the other team personnel making the trip , the person said .
" It was a misunderstanding of what agreement was reached between MLB and the MLBPA , " Red Sox president Larry Lucchino said .
" We said we would step up and make sure a second pool was created and would seek contributions from all parties . "
It was unclear whether Oakland would make additional payments to its staff .

2008 April 10
Explanation : Stickney Crater , the largest crater on the martian moon Phobos , is named for Chloe Angeline Stickney Hall , mathematician and wife of astronomer Asaph Hall .
Asaph Hall discovered both the Red Planet 's moons in 1877 .
Over 9 kilometers across , Stickney is nearly half the diameter of Phobos itself , so large that the impact that blasted out the crater likely came close to shattering the tiny moon .
This stunning , enhanced - color image of Stickney and surroundings was recorded by the HiRISE camera onboard the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter as it passed within some six thousand kilometers of Phobos last month .
Even though the surface gravity of asteroid - like Phobos is less than 1/1000th Earth 's gravity , streaks suggest loose material has slid down inside the crater walls over time .
Light bluish regions near the crater 's rim could indicate a relatively freshly exposed surface .
The origin of the curious grooves along the surface is mysterious but may be related to the crater - forming impact .

Renewing the American Economy
Sen. Barack Obama
Cooper Union
March 27 , 2008
I want to thank Mayor Bloomberg for his extraordinary leadership .
At a time when Washington is divided in old ideological battles , he shows us what can be achieved when we bring people together to seek pragmatic solutions .
Not only has he been a remarkable leader for New York — he has established himself as a major voice in our national debate on issues like renewing our economy , educating our children , and seeking energy independence .
Mr. Mayor , I share your determination to bring this country together to finally make progress for the American people .
In a city of landmarks , we meet at Cooper Union , just uptown from Federal Hall , where George Washington took the oath of office as the first President of the United States .
With all the history that has passed through the narrow canyons of lower Manhattan , it is worth taking a moment to reflect on the role that the market has played in the development of the American story .
The great task before our Founders that day was putting into practice the ideal that government could simultaneously serve liberty and advance the common good .
For Alexander Hamilton , the young Secretary of the Treasury , that task was bound to the vigor of the American economy .
Hamilton had a strong belief in the power of the market .
But he balanced that belief with the conviction that human enterprise “ may be beneficially stimulated by prudent aids and encouragements on the part of the government . ”
Government , he believed , had an important role to play in advancing our common prosperity .
So he nationalized the state Revolutionary War debts , weaving together the economies of the states and creating an American system of credit and capital markets .
And he encouraged manufacturing and infrastructure , so products could be moved to market .
Hamilton met fierce opposition from Thomas Jefferson , who worried that this brand of capitalism would favor the interests of the few over the many .
Jefferson preferred an agrarian economy because he believed that it would give individual landowners freedom , and that this freedom would nurture our democratic institutions .
But despite their differences , there was one thing that Jefferson and Hamilton agreed on — that economic growth depended upon the talent and ingenuity of the American people ; that in order to harness that talent , opportunity had to remain open to all ; and that through education in particular , every American could climb the ladder of social and economic mobility , and achieve the American Dream .
In the more than two centuries since then , we have struggled to balance the same forces that confronted Hamilton and Jefferson — self - interest and community ; markets and democracy ; the concentration of wealth and power , and the necessity of transparency and opportunity for each and every citizen .
Throughout this saga , Americans have pursued their dreams within a free market that has been the engine of America ’s progress .
It ’s a market that has created a prosperity that is the envy of the world , and opportunity for generations of Americans .
A market that has provided great rewards to the innovators and risk - takers who have made America a beacon for science , and technology , and discovery .
But the American experiment has worked in large part because we have guided the market ’s invisible hand with a higher principle .
Our free market was never meant to be a free license to take whatever you can get , however you can get it .
That is why we have put in place rules of the road to make competition fair , and open , and honest .
We have done this not to stifle — but rather to advance prosperity and liberty .
As I said at NASDAQ last September : the core of our economic success is the fundamental truth that each American does better when all Americans do better ; that the well being of American business , its capital markets , and the American people are aligned .
I think all of us here today would acknowledge that we ’ve lost that sense of shared prosperity .
This loss has not happened by accident .
It ’s because of decisions made in boardrooms , on trading floors and in Washington .
Under Republican and Democratic administrations , we failed to guard against practices that all too often rewarded financial manipulation instead of productivity and sound business practices .
We let the special interests put their thumbs on the economic scales .
The result has been a distorted market that creates bubbles instead of steady , sustainable growth ; a market that favors Wall Street over Main Street , but ends up hurting both .
Nor is this trend new .
The concentrations of economic power — and the failures of our political system to protect the American economy from its worst excesses — have been a staple of our past , most famously in the 1920s , when with success we ended up plunging the country into the Great Depression .
That is when government stepped in to create a series of regulatory structures — from the FDIC to the Glass - Steagall Act — to serve as a corrective to protect the American people and American business .
Ironically , it was in reaction to the high taxes and some of the outmoded structures of the New Deal that both individuals and institutions began pushing for changes to this regulatory structure .
But instead of sensible reform that rewarded success and freed the creative forces of the market , too often we ’ve excused and even embraced an ethic of greed , corner cutting and inside dealing that has always threatened the long - term stability of our economic system .
Too often , we ’ve lost that common stake in each other ’s prosperity .
Let me be clear : the American economy does not stand still , and neither should the rules that govern it .
The evolution of industries often warrants regulatory reform — to foster competition , lower prices , or replace outdated oversight structures .
Old institutions cannot adequately oversee new practices .
Old rules may not fit the roads where our economy is leading .
There were good arguments for changing the rules of the road in the 1990s .
Our economy was undergoing a fundamental shift , carried along by the swift currents of technological change and globalization .
For the sake of our common prosperity , we needed to adapt to keep markets competitive and fair .
Unfortunately , instead of establishing a 21st century regulatory framework , we simply dismantled the old one — aided by a legal but corrupt bargain in which campaign money all too often shaped policy and watered down oversight .
In doing so , we encouraged a winner take all , anything goes environment that helped foster devastating dislocations in our economy .
Deregulation of the telecommunications sector , for example , fostered competition but also contributed to massive over - investment .
Partial deregulation of the electricity sector enabled market manipulation .
Companies like Enron and WorldCom took advantage of the new regulatory environment to push the envelope , pump up earnings , disguise losses and otherwise engage in accounting fraud to make their profits look better — a practice that led investors to question the balance sheet of all companies , and severely damaged public trust in capital markets .
This was not the invisible hand at work .
Instead , it was the hand of industry lobbyists tilting the playing field in Washington , an accounting industry that had developed powerful conflicts of interest , and a financial sector that fueled over - investment .
A decade later , we have deregulated the financial services sector , and we face another crisis .
A regulatory structure set up for banks in the 1930s needed to change because the nature of business has changed .
But by the time the Glass - Steagall Act was repealed in 1999 , the $ 300 million lobbying effort that drove deregulation was more about facilitating mergers than creating an efficient regulatory framework .
Since then , we have overseen 21st century innovation — including the aggressive introduction of new and complex financial instruments like hedge funds and non-bank financial companies — with outdated 20th century regulatory tools .
New conflicts of interest recalled the worst excesses of the past — like the outrageous news that we learned just yesterday of KPMG allowing a lender to report profits instead of losses , so that both parties could make a quick buck .
Not surprisingly , the regulatory environment failed to keep pace .
When subprime mortgage lending took a reckless and unsustainable turn , a patchwork of regulators were unable or unwilling to protect the American people .
The policies of the Bush administration threw the economy further out of balance .
Tax cuts without end for the wealthiest Americans .
A trillion dollar war in Iraq that did n’t need to be fought , paid for with deficit spending and borrowing from foreign creditors like China .
A complete disdain for pay - as - you - go budgeting — coupled with a generally scornful attitude towards oversight and enforcement — allowed far too many to put short - term gain ahead of long term consequences .
The American economy was bound to suffer a painful correction , and policymakers found themselves with fewer resources to deal with the consequences .
Today , those consequences are clear .
I see them in every corner of our great country , as families face foreclosure and rising costs .
I seem them in towns across America , where a credit crisis threatens the ability of students to get loans , and states ca n’t finance infrastructure projects .
I see them here in Manhattan , where one of our biggest investment banks had to be bailed out , and the Fed opened its discount window to a host of new institutions with unprecedented implications we have yet to appreciate .
When all is said and done , losses will be in the many hundreds of billions .
What was bad for Main Street was bad for Wall Street .
Pain trickled up .
That is why the principle that I spoke about at NASDAQ is even more urgently true today : in our 21st - century economy , there is no dividing line between Main Street and Wall Street .
The decisions made in New York ’s high - rises have consequences for Americans across the country .
And whether those Americans can make their house payments ; whether they keep their jobs ; or spend confidently without falling into debt — that has consequences for the entire market .
The future cannot be shaped by the best - connected lobbyists with the best record of raising money for campaigns .
This thinking is wrong for the financial sector and it ’s wrong for our country .
I do not believe that government should stand in the way of innovation , or turn back the clock to an older era of regulation .
But I do believe that government has a role to play in advancing our common prosperity : by providing stable macroeconomic and financial conditions for sustained growth ; by demanding transparency ; and by ensuring fair competition in the marketplace .
Our history should give us confidence that we do n’t have to choose between an oppressive government - run economy and a chaotic and unforgiving capitalism .
It tells us we can emerge from great economic upheavals stronger , not weaker .
But we can do so only if we restore confidence in our markets .
Only if we rebuild trust between investors and lenders .
And only if we renew that common interest between Wall Street and Main Street that is the key to our success .
Now , as most experts agree , our economy is in a recession .
To renew our economy — and to ensure that we are not doomed to repeat a cycle of bubble and bust again and again — we need to address not only the immediate crisis in the housing market ; we also need to create a 21st century regulatory framework , and pursue a bold opportunity agenda for the American people .
Most urgently , we must confront the housing crisis .
After months of inaction , the President spoke here in New York and warned against doing too much .
His main proposal – extending tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans — is completely divorced from the reality that people are facing around the country .
John McCain recently announced his own plan , and it amounts to little more than watching this crisis happen .
While this is consistent with Senator McCain ’s determination to run for George Bush ’s third term , it wo n’t help families who are suffering , and it wo n’t help lift our economy out of recession .
Over two million households are at risk of foreclosure and millions more have seen their home values plunge .
Many Americans are walking away from their homes , which hurts property values for entire neighborhoods and aggravates the credit crisis .
To stabilize the housing market and help bring the foreclosure crisis to an end , I have sponsored Senator Chris Dodd ’s legislation creating a new FHA Housing Security Program , which will provide meaningful incentives for lenders to buy or refinance existing mortgages .
This will allow Americans facing foreclosure to keep their homes at rates they can afford .
Senator McCain argues that government should do nothing to protect borrowers and lenders who ’ve made bad decisions , or taken on excessive risk .
On this point , I agree .
But the Dodd - Frank package is not a bailout for lenders or investors who gambled recklessly , as they will take losses .
It is not a windfall for borrowers , as they will have to share any capital gain .
Instead , it offers a responsible and fair way to help bring an end to the foreclosure crisis .
It asks both sides to sacrifice , while preventing a long - term collapse that could have enormous ramifications for the most responsible lenders and borrowers , as well as the American people as a whole .
That is what Senator McCain ignores .
For homeowners who were victims of fraud , I ’ve also proposed a $ 10 billion Foreclosure Prevention Fund that would help them sell a home that is beyond their means , or modify their loan to avoid foreclosure or bankruptcy .
It ’s also time to amend our bankruptcy laws , so families are n’t forced to stick to the terms of a home loan that was predatory or unfair .
To prevent fraud in the future , I ’ve proposed tough new penalties on fraudulent lenders , and a Home Score system that will allow consumers to find out more about mortgage offers and whether they ’ll be able to make payments .
To help low - and middle - income families , I ’ve proposed a 10 percent mortgage interest tax credit that will allow homeowners who do n’t itemize their taxes to access incentives for home ownership .
And to expand home ownership , we must do more to help communities turn abandoned properties into affordable housing .
The government ca n’t do this alone , nor should it .
As I said last September , lenders must get ahead of the curve rather than just reacting to crisis .
They should actively look at all borrowers , offer workouts , and reduce the principal on mortgages in trouble .
Not only can this prevent the larger losses associated with foreclosure and resale , but it can reduce the extent of government intervention and taxpayer exposure .
Beyond dealing with the immediate housing crisis , it is time for the federal government to revamp the regulatory framework dealing with our financial markets .
Our capital markets have helped us build the strongest economy in the world .
They are a source of competitive advantage for our country .
But they cannot succeed without the public ’s trust .
The details of regulatory reform should be developed through sound analysis and public debate .
But there are several core principles for reform that I will pursue as President .
First , if you can borrow from the government , you should be subject to government oversight and supervision .
Secretary Paulson admitted this in his remarks yesterday .
The Federal Reserve should have basic supervisory authority over any institution to which it may make credit available as a lender of last resort .
When the Fed steps in , it is providing lenders an insurance policy underwritten by the American taxpayer .
In return , taxpayers have every right to expect that these institutions are not taking excessive risks .
The nature of regulation should depend on the degree and extent of the Fed ’s exposure .
But at the very least , these new regulations should include liquidity and capital requirements .
Second , there needs to be general reform of the requirements to which all regulated financial institutions are subjected .
Capital requirements should be strengthened , particularly for complex financial instruments like some of the mortgage securities that led to our current crisis .
We must develop and rigorously manage liquidity risk .
We must investigate rating agencies and potential conflicts of interest with the people they are rating .
And transparency requirements must demand full disclosure by financial institutions to shareholders and counterparties .
As we reform our regulatory system at home , we must work with international arrangements like the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision , the International Accounting Standards Board , and the Financial Stability Forum to address the same problems abroad .
The goal must be ensuring that financial institutions around the world are subject to similar rules of the road — both to make the system stable , and to keep our financial institutions competitive .
Third , we need to streamline a framework of overlapping and competing regulatory agencies .
Reshuffling bureaucracies should not be an end in itself .
But the large , complex institutions that dominate the financial landscape do not fit into categories created decades ago .
Different institutions compete in multiple markets — our regulatory system should not pretend otherwise .
A streamlined system will provide better oversight , and be less costly for regulated institutions .
Fourth , we need to regulate institutions for what they do , not what they are .
Over the last few years , commercial banks and thrift institutions were subject to guidelines on subprime mortgages that did not apply to mortgage brokers and companies .
It makes no sense for the Fed to tighten mortgage guidelines for banks when two - thirds of subprime mortgages do n’t originate from banks .
This regulatory framework has failed to protect homeowners , and it is now clear that it made no sense for our financial system .
When it comes to protecting the American people , it should make no difference what kind of institution they are dealing with .
Fifth , we must remain vigilant and crack down on trading activity that crosses the line to market manipulation .
Reports have circulated in recent days that some traders may have intentionally spread rumors that Bear Stearns was in financial distress while making market bets against the company .
The SEC should investigate and punish this kind of market manipulation , and report its conclusions to Congress .
Sixth , we need a process that identifies systemic risks to the financial system .
Too often , we deal with threats to the financial system that were n’t anticipated by regulators .
That ’s why we should create a financial market oversight commission , which would meet regularly and provide advice to the President , Congress , and regulators on the state of our financial markets and the risks that face them .
These expert views could help anticipate risks before they erupt into a crisis .
These six principles should guide the legal reforms needed to establish a 21st - century regulatory system .
But the change we need goes beyond laws and regulation — we need a shift in the cultures of our financial institutions and our regulatory agencies .
Financial institutions must do a better job at managing risks .
There is something wrong when boards of directors or senior managers do n’t understand the implications of the risks assumed by their own institutions .
It ’s time to realign incentives and compensation packages , so that both high level executives and employees better serve the interests of shareholders .
And it ’s time to confront the risks that come with excessive complexity .
Even the best government regulation cannot fully substitute for internal risk management .
For supervisory agencies , oversight must keep pace with innovation .
As the subprime crisis unfolded , tough questions about new and complex financial instruments were not asked .
As a result , the public interest was not protected .
We do American business — and the American people — no favors when we turn a blind eye to excessive leverage and dangerous risks .
Finally , the American people must be able to trust that their government is looking out for all of us — not just those who donate to political campaigns .
I fought in the Senate for the most extensive ethics reform since Watergate .
I have refused contributions from federal lobbyists and PACs .
And I have laid out far - reaching plans that I intend to sign into law as President to bring transparency to government , and to end the revolving door between industries and the federal agencies that oversee them .
Once we deal with the immediate crisis in housing and strengthen the regulatory system governing our financial markets , our final task is to restore a sense of opportunity for all Americans .
The bedrock of our economic success is the American Dream .
It 's a dream shared in big cities and small towns ; across races , regions and religions — that if you work hard , you can support a family ; that if you get sick , there will be health care you can afford ; that you can retire with the dignity and security and respect that you have earned ; that your kids can get a good education , and young people can go to college even if they 're not rich .
That is our common hope across this country .
That is the American Dream .
But today , for far too many Americans , this dream is slipping away .
Wall Street has been gripped by increasing gloom over the last nine months .
But for many American families , the economy has effectively been in recession for the past seven years .
We have just come through the first sustained period of economic growth since World War II that was not accompanied by a growth in incomes for typical families .
Americans are working harder for less .
Costs are rising , and it ’s not clear that we ’ll leave a legacy of opportunity to our children and grandchildren .
That ’s why , throughout this campaign , I ’ve put forward a series of proposals that will foster economic growth from the bottom up , and not just from the top down .
That ’s why the last time I spoke on the economy here in New York , I talked about the need to put the policies of George W. Bush behind us — policies that have essentially said to the American people : “ you are on your own ” ; because we need to pursue policies that once again recognize that we are in this together .
This starts with providing a stimulus that will reach the most vulnerable Americans , including immediate relief to areas hardest hit by the housing crisis , and a significant extension of unemployment insurance for those who are out of work .
If we can extend a hand to banks on Wall Street , we can extend a hand to Americans who are struggling .
Beyond these short term measures , as President I will be committed to putting the American Dream on a firmer footing .
To reward work and make retirement secure , we ’ll provide an income tax cut of up to $ 1000 for a working family , and eliminate income taxes altogether for any retiree making less than $ 50,000 per year .
To make health care affordable for all Americans , we ’ll cut costs and provide coverage to all who need it .
To put more Americans to work , we ’ll create millions of new Green Jobs and invest in rebuilding our nation ’s infrastructure .
To extend opportunity , we ’ll invest in our schools and our teachers , and make college affordable for every American .
And to ensure that America stays on the cutting edge , we ’ll expand broadband access , expand funding for basic scientific research , and pass comprehensive immigration reform so that we continue to attract the best and the brightest to our shores .
I know that making these changes wo n’t be easy .
I will not pretend that this will come without cost , though I have presented ways we can achieve these changes in a fiscally responsible way .
I know that we ’ll have to overcome our doubts and divisions and the determined opposition of powerful special interests before we can truly advance opportunity and prosperity for all Americans .
But I would not be running for President if I did n’t think that this was a defining moment in our history .
If we fail to overcome our divisions and continue to let special interest set the agenda , then America will fall behind .
Short - term gains will continue to yield long - term costs .
Opportunity will slip away on Main Street and prosperity will suffer here on Wall Street .
But if we unite this country around a common purpose , if we act on the responsibilities that we have to each other and to our country , then we can launch a new era of opportunity and prosperity .
I know we can do this because Americans have done this before .
Time and again , we ’ve recognized that common stake that we have in each other ’s success .
That ’s how people as different as Hamilton and Jefferson came together to launch the world ’s greatest experiment in democracy .
That ’s why our economy has n’t just been the world ’s greatest wealth creator — it ’s bound America together , it ’s created jobs , and it ’s made the dream of opportunity a reality for generations of Americans .
Now it falls to us .
We have as our inheritance the greatest economy the world has ever known .
We have the responsibility to continue the work that began on that spring day over two centuries ago right here in Manhattan — to renew our common purpose for a new century , and to write the next chapter in the story of America ’s success .
We can do this .
And we can begin this work today .

Race - related blog drawing white - hot reactions Race - related blog causing controversy
Caucasian site is flooded with hits

Asian women , fancy coffee , farmers markets , dinner parties and gay friends — these are just a sampling of life 's pleasures — if you 're white .
Excuse me ?
That 's according to John Lander , the ( white ) wit behind the Web sensation Stuff White People Like blog , an irreverent daily missive on the passions of posh urbanites of the Caucasian persuasion .
It 's the latest in a string of similar blogs ( first came theassimilatednegro.com , then angryasian.com ) that act as a virtual shrink 's sofa for those tackling the tricky topics of race and class .
Lander is not the only one who uses the Web site as cheap and easy therapy , though the 29 - year - old admits that 's exactly what it is for him .
Readers , hundreds every day , flood the site 's comment section with alternating fury and delight .
To date , there have been 14 million hits , reflecting the nation 's current obsession with race and gender , too .
For confirmation , check out the comments and speeches by presidential candidates Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton just this past week .
Dean Rader , a pop culture critic who authors weeklyrader .
blogspot.com , says readers flock to Stuff White People Like because it 's hip and hot and the place to be seen and heard online .
" It 's just as much about class and coolness and yuppiness and consumption ( as race ) . "
And yes , if the some of the posts push far beyond the boundaries of good taste , readers seem to find liberation in an environment unfettered by political correctness .
Take # 11 on the list : " Asian Girls : 95 % of white males have at one point in their lives experienced yellow fever .
...
White men love Asian women so much that they will go to extremes such as stating that Sandra Oh is sexy , teaching English in Asia , playing in a co-ed volleyball league ... "
Ouch .
That post has received more than 1,550 responses .
Other posts — try No. 36 , " Breakfast Places " and No. 63 , " Expensive Sandwiches " — may seem a bit more benign , but the post and ensuing conversations carry just as much bite .
" To a white person , there is no better way to spend a Saturday morning than to get up late , around 9:30 and pile into your Audi or Volvo and drive to one of these little places and eat breakfast with friends , " Lander writes .
" Oftentimes these breakfasts last for an hour or more ( hence the long lines and wait times ) .
Some white people take it to the next level and bring their dogs , newspapers or even a laptop . "
Lander says the blog 's title has drawn more controversy than any of the posts .
White people hate being lumped into a group that they do n't feel a part of , he says , adding , " that 's essentially the same thing that every minority has been dealing with for centuries . "

When a Great Power Goes Mad With the fifth anniversary of the Iraq War and the grim milestone of 4,000 U.S. dead , the nation has been awash with news retrospectives on the war and speeches by politicians , mostly offering sanitized versions of what 's transpired .

With a few exceptions , these media / political reflections have had the feel of self - rationalizations , more than self - criticisms .
They ’ve conveyed a sense that the U.S. system is doing just fine , thank you , although a few mistakes were made .
So , you have President George W. Bush , the chief author of this catastrophic war , declaring that “ normalcy is returning back to Iraq ” even as fighting rages across much of the country and rockets rain down on the highly fortified Green Zone in Baghdad .
Bush ’s comment invited comparisons to the acronym coined by U.S. Army soldiers during World War II : SNAFU for “ situation normal , all fucked up . ”
In the news media , there were specials , including a much - touted PBS Frontline two - parter on “ Bush ’s War ” which followed the mainstream line of mostly accepting the Bush administration ’s good intentions while blaming the disaster on policy execution – a lack of planning , bureaucratic rivalries , rash decisions and wishful thinking .
The chief interviews for the program were with former Bush administration officials and with journalists – such as Michael Gordon and John Burns of the New York Times whose influential reporting helped set the stage for the war – and with Bob Woodward , whose Bush at War was a generally flattering account of Bush ’s decision - making .
Remaining outside the frame of mainstream U.S. debate was any serious examination of the war ’s fundamental illegality .
During the post - World War II trials at Nuremberg , the United States led the world in decrying aggressive war as “ the supreme international crime differing only from other war crimes in that it contains within itself the accumulated evil of the whole . ”
Yet , Frontline and other mainstream U.S. news outlets shy away from this central fact of the Iraq War : by invading Iraq without the approval of the U.N. Security Council and under false pretenses , the Bush administration released upon the Iraqi people “ the accumulated evil of the whole ” – and committed the “ supreme ” war crime .
An obvious reason why the mainstream U.S. press can’t handle this truth is that to do so would mean that President Bush , Vice President Dick Cheney , a host of other U.S. officials and even some prominent journalists could be regarded as war criminals .
To accept that reality would , in turn , create a moral imperative to take action .
And that would require a great disruption in the existing U.S. power structure , which has n’t changed much since Bush won authorization from Congress in October 2002 to use force and then invaded Iraq in March 2003 .
Not only are Bush and Cheney still in office – and two of the three remaining presidential candidates , John McCain and Hillary Clinton , voted for the war – but the roster of top Washington journalists remains remarkably intact from five years ago .
Iraq War hawk Fred Hiatt still runs the Washington Post ’s editorial pages where you can still read the likes of Charles Krauthammer , David Ignatius , Richard Cohen and a bunch of other columnists who pushed for the war .
The same is true for the New York Times ’s op - ed page , where writers like Thomas Friedman have prospered despite their erroneous war judgments and where one of the few changes has been to recruit prominent neoconservative William Kristol , who has used his column to chide Americans who wo n’t hail Bush ’s courageous war leadership .
Deeper Trends
In evaluating this corrupt political / media elite , a historian might want to go back even further and wonder how someone as eminently unqualified and unfit as George W. Bush became president of the most powerful nation on earth .
How did a technologically sophisticated country like the United States with a relatively free press get led down this dangerous path ?
Why did so many American voters in 2000 believe made - up stories about Al Gore ’s supposed delusions , like the apocryphal quote , “ I invented the Internet ” ?
Indeed , how did a seemingly endless supply of myths and half - truths take root in the American psyche ?
Going back even a bit further , how were Americans sold on the happy tales of Ronald Reagan ’s presidency as the blood of U.S. - supported dirty wars in Central America and elsewhere was washed from the nation ’s memory bank ?
Why in a media environment with 24 - hour cable news programming has intelligent dissent against U.S. foreign policy been so marginalized and excluded ?
Why are editors and producers so afraid of allowing some of these voices to be heard ?
How has such a destructive “ group think ” been allowed to take hold ?
One of the obvious answers is fear – at least fear that one ’s career would be irreparably damaged by wandering too far outside the safety of the herd .
And while running with that herd , it ’s understood that there ’s much greater safety in veering right , given the well - funded conservative attack groups that have devoured the careers of many independent - minded journalists who refused to bend .
( I ’ve tried to address this history in my books , including Lost History , Secrecy & Privilege and Neck Deep , as well as at Consortiumnews.com . )
Well - Spoken Madness
While many Americans – both inside and outside Washington – recognize these real - world constraints on how politicians and journalists address issues , the larger consequences are less understood .
What these trends have done over the past three decades is not just shift the dominant U.S. political / media system to the right .
Nor have they just constructed a “ group think ” that excludes reasonable points of view that challenge the conventional wisdom .
The cumulative effect of this willful conformity and this informal censorship has been to engender a form of collective madness at the decision - making levels of the U.S. government -- and within the upper echelons of the news media .
But it is a flexible form of insanity in which reality is alternatively banished – as it was in the early phases of the Iraq War , from WMD " mushroom clouds " through " Mission Accomplished " – and then is brought in for retooling when matters get too far out of control , when the jarring gap between the official line and the truth starts to destabilize the national political consensus .
In listening to the measured tones of the Frontline narration – not to mention the well - dressed ex-government officials and the well - spoken mainstream journalists – I was left with the feeling that a new synthetic “ reality ” was being lowered in to replace the older discredited version .
It was as if the bloody madness that President Bush inflicted on the people of Iraq – aided and abetted by many witting and unwitting American accomplices – was being drained of its crimson hue and stripped of its human horrors .
Forget the hundreds of thousands of Iraqi dead and maimed .
Forget the innumerable lives destroyed and the millions displaced .
Forget the bizarre forms of torture at Abu Ghraib and the widespread mistreatment of detainees at other Iraqi prisons .
After all , we were being told , the war ’s architects were honorable and reasonable men and women who were trying to do the right thing , but sadly they were undermined by bureaucratic inertia , back - biting and , yes , incompetence .
It was just one big SNAFU .
But , with a few changes here and there – a new general or two , a tweaked counter - insurgency strategy , some more U.S. soldiers and a bit more patience – everything will work out just fine .
No need for national guilt .
No need for accountability .
No reason to purge the editorial offices of leading newspapers and TV networks .
No reason to talk about impeachment or war - crimes tribunals for committing the " supreme " crime against world peace .
No need for any of that .
As President Bush said on March 27 , “ normalcy is returning back to Iraq , ” if you do n't take note of the mayhem all around .
One might add that a similar form of “ normalcy is returning back to Washington , ” if you do n't take note of all the lies and the self - deceptions .

So today the Blue Majority sites ( dKos , Swing State Project , and Open Left ) added Barack Obama to our ActBlue fundraising page .
All three sites held votes of their readership .
Daily Kos passed the super - majority threshold a few weeks ago , SSP and Open Left did it yesterday .
It 's clear our communities have become heavily pro-Obama , especially as Clinton 's only path to victory is via coup by super delegate and civil war , and she does n't give a damn .
Bowers gives his four reasons for the move :
First , many people have said that there are few policy differences between Obama and Clinton , but the truth is that their telecom policies could hardly be further apart from each other .
Obama proposes exactly the sort of transformative , open telecommunications policy that we need to transform the media landscape in America , while Hillary Clinton 's telecom proposals are nothing more than heinous corporate welfare .
Without a transformed telecommunications landscape , we are going to have an extremely difficult time building a progressive America or passing any of our other legislation .
Second , in terms of electability , in order to win the general election a candidate must first become the nominee .
Simply put , I do n't see many ways for Hillary Clinton to pull that off .
Further , in order to win the general election , Democrats will need time to define McCain , and time to heal the party once the nomination contest is over .
However , Hillary Clinton 's only path to the nomination is through convention in late August , and also through a intra-partisan civil war .
In other words , Clinton 's path to the nomination renders her unelectable in the general .
There simply wo n't be enough time to heal the party and define John McCain .
Third , how a candidate campaigns is a strong reflection on how that candidate governs .
For example , we could tell from the 2000 election that George Bush would govern through a series of power grabs , Orwellian language , and with a total disregard for popular opinion .
Barack Obama , by contrast , is campaigning through unprecedented national grassroots organizing , speeches that are becoming the stuff of legend , and the manifestation of a new political coalition that moves us away from the political alignment of 1968 - 2004 .
Too often , I have heard from the Clinton campaign and its surrogates about states and demographic groups that do n't matter .
Such statements are a stark reminder of a recent version of the Democratic Party that takes its base for granted , and only campaigns in a select few swing districts .
We need a Democratic Party that organizes and governs based on Barack Obama and Howard Dean 's campaign styles , rather than one that is based on Hillary Clinton 's and Terry McAuliffe's .
Fourth , coattails and movement building matter .
In both of Blue Majority 's victories so far in 2008 , Donna Edwards in MD - 04 and Bill Foster in IL - 14 , the energy and activism brought to bear by Barack Obama were key .
The activism in support of Barack Obama has the potential to greatly enhance the political reach of the progressive movement , and also to provide Democrats with sweeping downticket victories .
I once called this progressive movement symbiosis , and I still believe it is the most promising path to a truly progressive governing majority that I have seen in my lifetime .
Those are pretty solid reasons .
For me , the third and fourth are pretty much 95 % of the reason I decided to begin aggressively supporting Obama after spending most of this cycle either uncommitted , pro-Dodd , or soft Obama .
Remember , we 're looking for 6,500 donors by the end of the quarter , so we 've got 860 to go .
And aside from Obama , we 've got some great House and Senate candidates on our Blue Majority page .
We did n't notch victories like Donna Edwards and Bill Foster this year by slacking and sitting things out .
We change our country one candidate at a time , and we 've got great ones .
So chip in what you can .
Even $ 10 helps .
Two is a start , but we 've got lots more to go .
So join the 5,640 who have already chipped in for a Bluer majority this cycle .

I was surprised to learn that my How To Ask For A Raise In 3 Steps article attracts many new visitors to my website .
The reason I ’m surprised about it is because this early article of mine has receivedsince it was published almost one year ago .
In other words , the lack of responses caused me to think this article was unpopular .
In reality , however , people were constantly discovering this article via Google searches : “ how to ask for a raise letter ” — “ letter asking for a raise ” — “ asking for a raise letter ” — etc .

Given the above listed responsibilities and initiatives , I would respectfully request that in addition to the customary cost of living increase for FY2007 , I also be considered for a merit raise commensurate with my job performance .
I fully realize that public sector jobs do not necessarily pay as well as those in the private industry , however , in researching the salary.com website ( which does not differentiate between public and private job sectors ) , it notes the median expected salary for a typical Help Desk Support , Sr. in the Atlantic City area is $ 57,715 .
While the median expected salary for a typical Network Administrator I is $ 51,687 , and the median expected salary for a typical Software Engineer is $ 58,336 .
All of these full time jobs occupy a fraction of the work I perform as a Senior Technical Assistant – Management Information Systems .
I also realize that after only two years with the [ Library ] , it would be difficult to expect an increase in salary from my current level of $ 30,000 to a median of $ 50,000 to $ 60,000 .
Nevertheless , I would greatly appreciate your consideration of this request for a salary increase in 2007 .
Based on the level of my responsibilities and performance in carrying - out the same , perhaps some thought could be given to a more appropriate job title that would warrant a higher salary .
In closing , I want you to know that I truly enjoy my work at the [ Library ] , and trust that you can appreciate the basis on which I am making this request .
After you have had a chance to review this letter , I would welcome the opportunity to discuss this matter with you in greater detail .
Sincerely yours , Shaun Boyd
The above sample letter is an actual letter I submitted to my supervisor in August of 2006 .
The letter was well - received , and my supervisor presented my case to the Director of the organization .
My efforts were acknowledged , but my request for a raise was denied .
I believe that if the decision was at the sole discretion of my supervisor , I would have received a raise or promotion in response to my letter .
Unfortunately , there were other factors involved that prohibited me from getting what many felt was rightfully mine .
This , I believe , is not so uncommon : People deserve to be making more than what they ’re earning , but something is holding them back .
Maybe it ’s the budget .
Maybe it ’s the bottom line .
Or maybe it ’s not .
Maybe the only thing that separates you from the raise you deserve is the simple question :
Can I have a raise ?
Until you ask , you ’ll never know .

The strengths of the academic enterprise
In the Western world , 66 institutions have enjoyed a continuously visible identity since 1530 .
Among those 66 are the Roman Catholic Church , the Lutheran Church and the Parliaments of Iceland and the Isle of Man .
What makes these 66 so interesting — and I owe the knowledge of this fact to our President Dr. Berdahl — is that the remaining 62 are all universities !
It strikingly demonstrates that universities have a potential for " longevity " , but we should not make the mistake of concluding that they are " immortal " or invulnerable , for they are not : if they have existed for centuries , that is because successive generations of scholars and students have nurtured them well and with devotion .
It is the obvious task of the current generation to hand over to the next what it got from the previous one , and in order to do so well , we had better understand how the strengths of the academic enterprise are maintained most effectively .
Hence my title .
But before I can turn to my topic proper , I must make a few introductory remarks lest I be misunderstood .
The first one is that when we move from one society to another , all important words subtly change their meaning , and in connection with today 's topic I must mention : university , education , training , teaching , scholar , scientist , engineer , theoretical , experimental , and applied .
This was brought home to me in 1968 at a conference in Garmisch - Partenkirchen .
I worked at the time at the Department of Mathematics of the Eindhoven University of Technology in the Netherlands , and told at that conference that the official academic title our graduates earned was ' Mathematical Engineer " , and most of the Americans began to laugh , because for them it sounded as a contradiction in terms , mathematics being sophisticated and unpractical , engineering being straightforward and practical .
To give you another example , in the early 80's I learned that professors at Stanford University could use their grant money in the name of their research to pay someone else to do their teaching .
When I heard that , I was shocked , when my wife heard it , she could not believe it , because we grew up with an academic culture in which teaching and research were considered warp and weft of the same fabric .
In that view , a professor who does not get valuable inspiration from his own lectures and therefore does not regard his teaching as a precious experience , is just in the wrong business : he should teach at a vocational school or work at a research laboratory .
So please , keep in mind that all important words I use may mean something different from what you are used to .
My second warning remark is that I shall refuse to discuss the academic enterprise in financial terms .
The first reason is that the habit of trying to understand , explain , or justify in financial terms is unhealthy : it creates the ethics of the best - seller society in which saleability is confused with quality .
The other day we had to discuss the professional quality of one of our colleagues , in whose favour it was then mentioned that one of his Ph.D.s had earned lots and lots of money in the computer business , and few people seemed to notice how ridiculous a recommendation this was .
We also know that the financial success of a product can be totally independent of its quality ( as everyone who remembers for instance the commercially successful IBM360 should know ) .
The second reason for my refusal is that the value of money is a very fuzzy notion , so fuzzy in fact , that efforts to understand in financial terms always lead to greater confusion .
[ Remember this , for it is quite likely that this afternoon will give you the opportunity to observe the phenomenon .
Note that money need not be mentioned explicitly for the nonsense to emerge , a reference to " the taxpayer " can do the job .
The role of " the taxpayer " then invariably leads to the conclusion that of State Universities at least the undergraduate curriculum has to be second - or third - rate . ]
The final reason for my refusal is that the habit appeals to the quantitative mind and I come from a culture in which the primarily quantitative mind does not evoke admiration .
[ A major reason that we considered Roman Catholics to belong to a lower class was precisely their quantitative bent : they always counted , number of faithful , number of days in purgatory , you name it ..... ]
My third remark introduces you to the Buxton Index , so named after its inventor , Professor John Buxton , at the time at Warwick University .
The Buxton Index of an entity , i.e. person or organization , is defined as the length of the period , measured in years , over which the entity makes its plans .
For the little grocery shop around the corner it is about 1/2 , for the true Christian it is infinity , and for most other entities it is in between : about 4 for the average politician who aims at his re-election , slightly more for most industries , but much less for the managers who have to write quarterly reports .
The Buxton Index is an important concept because close co-operation between entities with very different Buxton Indices invariably fails and leads to moral complaints about the partner .
The party with the smaller Buxton Index is accused of being superficial and short - sighted , while the party with the larger Buxton Index is accused of neglect of duty , of backing out of its responsibility , of freewheeling , etc . .
In addition , each party accuses the other one of being stupid .
The great advantage of the Buxton Index is that , as a simple numerical notion , it is morally neutral and lifts the difference above the plane of moral concerns .
The Buxton Index is important to bear in mind when considering academic / industrial co-operation .
My fourth and last introductory remark draws attention to a whole spectrum of techniques by which one generation transmits its insights and abilities to the next .
At the one extreme we have the techniques of the guilds which treat their insights and abilities as valuable property , as a treasure to be kept secret .
Their technique for protecting the secrecy is by keeping the secret knowledge unformulated ; therefore , the apprentice has to join a master for seven meagre years , during which he can absorb the craft by osmosis , so to speak .
The university is at the other end of the spectrum : it is the professor 's task to bring the relevant insights and abilities into the public domain by explicit formulation .
It is no accident that the universities as we know them started to flourish after the art of book printing had been established .
There is more to be said about that spectrum of educational techniques , but I shall not do so now ; I mentioned it to remind you why the absence of secrecy , or , more positively formulated , openness and honesty are characteristics that touch the heart of the academic enterprise : a university that hides or cheats can close its doors .
The essential role of openness is something to remember when considering academic / industrial co-operation ; it should also be remembered whenever a government invents reasons of national security or prosperity for the prevention of free publication of the results of academic research .
Universities are not part of the nation 's security organisation , they are not the nation 's research laboratory either : they are the nation 's universities .
In passing I would like to mention that in a rather different sense such openness is a precondition for academic survival .
Just for being different and doing things the uneducated cannot understand , the academics are hated and feared , vide Socrates , executed in 399 BC , Archimedes , killed in 212 BC , and , more recently , Hypatia , AD 415 barbarously murdered by a Christian mob .
The original Oxford Colleges were buildings fortified in order to protect the students against the rabble , and if you think that that is old hat , I refer you to the DDR or the People 's Republic of China of only 25 years ago .
It is a miracle whenever , these days , the academic world is tolerated at all ; personally I am convinced that what tolerance there is would completely disappear , were the academic world to become secretive .

Advertisement Pairs of rooks can co-operate to solve problems , scientists report .
An experiment revealed that the rooks would team up so they could reach a tray of food that was inaccessible to lone birds .
The researchers from the University of Cambridge were surprised to find that the birds performed as well as chimpanzees at the test .
The research is published in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B .
The researchers presented pairs of captive birds with a tray topped with tasty morsels of egg yolk and mealworm - however , it was placed just out of reach , outside of the birds ' cage .
A single piece of string was threaded through two hooks on the tray , with each end left dangling 60 cm ( 24in ) apart , just inside the rooks ' enclosure .
Psychologist Amanda
Seed , the lead author of the paper , who is now based at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Germany , said : " If just one bird pulled on one end of the string , it would slip out from the loops .
Rooks form monogamous relationships for life and live in colonies " The question was would they work out , without any training , that they needed one bird to pull on one end of the string and another to pull on the other , simultaneously , to get to the food ? "
The team , including Nicola Clayton and Nathan Emery , discovered that the eight pairs were happy to cooperate , with some pairs solving the task straight away , others taking a day or two to work out that team - work was the key to getting their nibbles .
Dr Seed told the BBC News website : " They performed remarkably well - as well as chimps when they were presented with the same test . "
The team then gave the rooks another trial .
This time a single rook was presented with the same tray - string set - up , while its pair waited in a neighbouring cage linked by a one - way flap .
The idea was to see whether the rook would wait for the other rook to enter the enclosure so they could once again work together to reach the food .
Dr Seed said : " We found the birds just did n't wait . "
The researchers believe that while rooks had the ability to cooperate , they may have failed to understand the importance and value of the act .
Dr Seed said : " The results suggest the rooks were n't using information about the efficacy of the partner : the need for the partner to solve that task . "
However , chimps , when presented with the same scenario were happy to wait and team - up .
Dr Seed explained : " In terms of the cognitive mechanisms underpinning co-operation , there may be a difference between rooks and chimps .
" This could be because social groups of rooks and chimpanzees are structured differently .
" Chimpanzee society is a dynamic mix of cooperative and competitive relationships , whilst rook groups seem to be more stable . "
Rooks ( Corvus frugilegus ) are members of the crow family .
They live in colonies and form monogamous relationships for life .
The researchers are now keen to find out if other species of birds perform his kind of co-operative behaviour .

What are these ?
A Washington state man who used Caller ID spoofing to send armed cops to the homes of a dozen innocent people was sentenced to 30 months in prison Wednesday , and ordered to pay nearly $ 24,000 in restitution to the police departments he hoaxed .
Guadalupe Santana Martinez , 31 , is the first defendant to be sentenced in federal court in Dallas for a string of so - called " swatting " crimes against people who angered them on telephone party lines .
Four admitted co-conspirators face sentencing in March and April
Martinez pleaded guilty to a single count of conspiracy , and admitted in his plea agreement to two separate 2006 swatting attacks against Stephanie Proulx , a party line participant , and her father .
In both those calls , Martinez phoned non-emergency police lines and told dispatchers that he had shot and killed members of the family , that he was using hallucinogenic drugs , and that if he did n't get $ 50,000 and transportation across the border to Mexico he'd kill the remaining hostages with his AK - 47 .
He used the Caller ID spoofing service Spoofcard to make calls appear to come from his victims ' phones .
The FBI took an interest in the case in October 2006 , when a police detective responding to the Proulx call realized he 'd already been to the apartment on an earlier false emergency .
FBI agents arrested
Martinez outside a Denny 's in a Seattle suburb in January 2007 , and he admitted to the Proulx swats , and to similar hoaxes targeting 10 other people since 2004 , most of them in Washington state .
One victim , in 2004 , was targeted when he started dating Martinez 's ex-girlfriend .
Co-defendant Jason Trowbridge is scheduled for sentencing on March
27 , followed by Chad Ward on April 3rd , ringleader Stuart Rosoff on
April 10th , and Trowbridge 's girlfriend Angela Roberson on April 17 .
All have agreed to cooperate with prosecutors prepping a new round of indictments against other suspects .
In addition to the prison time , U.S. District Court Judge Ed
Kinkeade sentenced Martinez to three years of supervised release .
With credit for good behavior , Martinez will be released in early March
2009 .

Russia has warned that a new arms race is unfolding around the world
Russian President Vladimir Putin made the comments in Moscow alongside Ukraine 's President , Viktor Yushchenko .
Mr Putin has condemned US plans to include Poland and the Czech Republic in its missile defence shield .
The leaders had been meeting in urgent talks over a gas dispute and announced a deal to avoid disrupting supplies .
' Frightening '
Speaking at a news conference at the Kremlin on Tuesday , Mr Putin said he had advised Ukraine not to join Nato , but admitted he would be unable to interfere in any such move .
" Restrictions on sovereignty ... have already had certain consequences , such as the stationing of bases or a positioning area for missile defence in Eastern Europe , which we believe is aimed at neutralising our nuclear missile potential , " he said .
" Russia therefore faces a need to take retaliatory action . "
The US wants the shield to destroy incoming ballistic missiles potentially coming from North Korea and Iran .
Current plans would see some interceptor missiles based in Poland and an associated radar built in the Czech Republic .
" It is frightening not only to say but even to think that Russia , in response to the emergence of such positioning areas on Ukrainian territory , which cannot be ruled out in theory , will target its offensive missile systems at Ukraine , " he said .
" Can you imagine that for a second ?
That is what we are concerned about . "
President Yushchenko said he realised a number of " sensitive issues " would emerge from Ukraine 's attempt to join Nato , but that he hoped they could be dealt with through dialogue , openness and trust .
" One must realise that everything Ukraine is doing in this area is certainly not aimed against any third country , especially Russia , " he added .
In a televised speech to the Russian State Council last week , Mr Putin had warned that a " new phase in the arms race is unfolding in the world " .
He said other countries were spending far more than Russia on new weapons , but that his country would respond to the challenges of an arms race by developing hi-tech weaponry .
Nato invitation
On the gas dispute , Ukraine agreed to start repaying $ 1.5 bn ( £ 770 m ) owed to the Russian gas company , Gazprom , from Thursday .
In return , Russia is reported to have agreed to freeze the price of gas exports to Ukraine at last year 's level .
The dispute had raised concerns in European countries , which experienced disruption to their gas supplies as the result of a similar dispute two years ago .
Separately on Tuesday , Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Mr Putin had accepted an invitation to attend the forthcoming Nato summit in the Romanian capital , Bucharest , in April .
Mr Putin will no longer be Russian president in April .
Elections for his successor will be held next month .
" This yet again testifies to the fact that Russia is open to dialogue on any issues , " Mr Lavrov told reporters while attending the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva .
At the conference , Russia and China proposed a new treaty to ban the use of weapons in space and the use or threat of force against satellites or other craft .
TEHRAN ( Reuters ) - Russia urged Iran on Tuesday to comply with demands by the United Nations Security Council to curb its nuclear program , but Tehran was defiant .
The Russian comments underlined Moscow ’s commitment to tackle Tehran after the Security Council passed a resolution on Monday imposing a third round of sanctions on Iran for its refusal to suspend sensitive nuclear activities .
Russia and China have been lukewarm about taking tough action on Iran compared with the European Union and with the United States , which fears it is seeking a nuclear bomb .
“ This resolution is a serious political signal to Tehran about the need to cooperate with the U.N. Security Council , ” Russia ’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement .
The resolution imposed more travel and financial curbs on Iranian individuals and companies , expanded a ban on trade in items with both civilian and military uses , and called for increased vigilance over Iranian financial institutions .
Tehran , which has ignored all Council demands to freeze its uranium enrichment program , rejected the new resolution .
“ This resolution ... has been issued based on political motives and hostile orientations and lacks value , is unacceptable and condemned , ” Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Ali Hosseini was quoted by IRNA news agency as saying .
President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said that “ the Iranian nation ’s fearlessness and resistance is viewed favorably in all countries of the world . ”
Iran says its work on uranium enrichment -- which can produce fuel for nuclear power plants or atomic weapons -- is part of a program meant purely to generate electricity .
It has previously dismissed the impact of sanctions , saying it has a cushion of crude revenues thanks to windfall earnings as the world ’s fourth largest oil producer .
But business executives say the measures are making foreigners increasingly wary of investing in Iran , slowing down major oil and other projects , and pushing up trading costs as more foreign banks avoid dealings with the Islamic Republic .
TRADE WITH CHINA
Diplomats said the new sanctions were a moderate tightening and the most Washington could get after a U.S. intelligence report said Iran had scrapped an atom bomb program in 2003 .
“ We were pleased yesterday to see that the U.N. Security Council went forward with a third round of sanctions , ” White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said .
“ A lot of people thought that was n’t going to be possible after our National Intelligence Estimate came out in December ... ”
Efforts to curb Tehran ’s nuclear program have been driven by permanent Security Council members the United States , Britain and France , working along with Germany .
Permanent members Russia and China have resisted strong sanctions , which they say would make Iran unwilling to cooperate on international safeguards meant to stop nuclear proliferation .
China , an increasingly important commercial partner as Western businesses scale back dealings with Tehran , said the new sanctions would not affect its trade with Iran .

Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Qin Ganghe told a news conference his country ’s trade ties with Iran “ have no correlation with Iran ’s nuclear plans and also do not go against the U.N. Security Council ’s resolutions ” .
Russia ’s Foreign Ministry said the U.N. resolution was “ an uneasy compromise ” from which all the “ excessive political and economic demands by hardliners ” had been dropped .
It urged permanent Council members , plus Germany , to “ demonstrate their readiness for serious cooperation with Iran . ”
But it also said : “ We expect Iran ’s leadership to analyze thoroughly the declaration by the six foreign ministers as well as the contents of the adopted resolution , and opt in favor of meeting demands by the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) and Security Council . ”

WORRIES OVER WEAPONISATION
In Geneva , Iranian Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki reiterated an Iranian assertion that a February 22 report by the IAEA had cleared up questions about its nuclear program , and said there was no justification for the sanctions .
IAEA Director Mohamed ElBaradei denied this on Monday .
He said improved Iranian transparency had settled some questions , but intelligence suggesting Tehran was trying to “ weaponise ” nuclear materials remained a pressing issue .
Weaponisation usually refers to the process of making nuclear warheads for delivery on missiles .
Iran said the intelligence was fabricated by the United States .
While Iran and the IAEA disputed the details , ordinary people in Tehran said they were the ones who were suffering from rising prices that they blamed on the sanctions .
White House spokeswoman Perino said : “ It ’s unfortunate for the Iranian people that their regime continues to isolate them in this way , but that ’s the choice that their regime has made . ”
Asked whether Washington would push for a fourth round of sanctions , she said : “ We just finished the third round , so I think let ’s see .
I think the most important next step is that countries implement the sanctions and make sure that they follow through on that obligation . ”

Google 's " I 'm feeling lucky " button was designed to save web searchers time by automatically opening the first page of a query .
It turns out the feature , and similar ones from other search engines , are increasingly helping junk mailers get around anti-spam products .
That 's one of the findings from a January Intelligence report from MessageLabs .
The IT security firm found that so - called search engine spam , which only came to light in the past few weeks , accounted for 17 per cent of all the spam the company saw in January .
The emails include links that work like this one .
When a recipient clicks on them , they frequently lead to destinations hosting malware or phishing sites .
But because the links make no mention of the naughty URL itself , many anti-spam filters do n't catch them .
Anti-phishing protections built in to browsers and browser plug-ins also fail to catch them , in many cases .
To change things up , spammers frequently use different regionalized search engine sites , such as google .
com.hk and google .co.uk .
The new technique is " probably more a manifestation of the ebb and flow of the good - guy versus bad - guy arms race , " says MessageLabs Chief Security Analyst Mark Sunner .
" There really has n't been a necessity until this point for the bad guys to raise their game with this technique . "
Also in January , MessageLabs saw a spike in spam pitching get - rich - quick and other financially - related services .
Coming amid a wave of news articles reporting problems with the US and global economies , the spam is playing off of people 's anxiety about their finances , Sunner said .
MessageLabs saw declines in other types of junk mail .
Spam touting stocks fell to just two per cent in January , an all - time low since MessageLabs began keeping count .
Company researchers said the decline could be related to the arrest of notorious spammer Alan Ralsky , who according to federal prosecutors , was engaged in a sophisticated pump - and - dump operation with 10 other individuals until it was shut down almost four weeks ago .
While MessageLabs made no mention of an initiative implemented in March by the Securities and Exchange Commission , this is likely also to be responsible for the drop .
Under the program , penny stocks that are the subject of pump - and - dump email campaigns are temporarily suspended immediately following the issuance of the spam - preventing the architects from being able to profit from the scheme .
Remove the profit and chances are you 'll remove the crime , too .
Indeed , both Symantec and the SEC have reported declines in stock - related spam following the new rules .
MessageLabs also said the amount of image spam fell in January to just two percent of all junk mail .
That compares with a high of 20 per cent last summer .
The company provides email and web filtering services for more than 16,000 business customers .
It processes more than 2.5 billion email connections and one billion web requests each day . ®

ABU DHABI ( Reuters ) - U.S. President George W. Bush accused Iran on Sunday of threatening security around the world by backing militants and urged his Gulf Arab allies to confront “ this danger before it is too late ” .
Iran said it rejected such efforts to isolate Iran among its Gulf neighbors , adding that “ such policies of fooling the people in the region ” had already fallen flat .
Speaking in Abu Dhabi , the third stop of his tour of Arab allies , Bush said Shi’ite Muslim Iran was the world ’s number one sponsor of terrorism and accused it of undermining peace by supporting the Hezbollah guerrilla group in Lebanon , Palestinian Islamist group Hamas and Shi’ite militants in Iraq .
“ Iran ’s actions threaten the security of nations everywhere .
So the United States is strengthening our longstanding security commitments with our friends in the Gulf and rallying friends around the world to confront this danger before it is too late .
“ Iran is today the world ’s leading state sponsor of terror .
It sends hundreds of millions of dollars to extremists around the world while its own people face repression and economic hardship at home , ” he said in his keynote speech .
Iran , which blames sectarian violence in Iraq on the U.S. - led invasion to topple Saddam Hussein in 2003 , said Washington ’s efforts to isolate Tehran “ fell flat ” .
“ We advise them not to pursue such policies of fooling the people in the region , ” Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Ali Hosseini told a news conference .
His comments were translated into English by Iran ’s Press TV satellite station .
NUCLEAR AMBITIONS
The Bush administration has kept up a campaign of rhetoric against Iran , including accusing it of seeking a nuclear capability despite a U.S. intelligence report that concluded Iran had halted its nuclear arms program in 2003 .
Bush last year said a nuclear - armed Iran could mean “ World War Three ” , and Washington is pushing for a third set of sanctions on Iran for refusing to halt enrichment work , as demand by the United Nations .
Highly enriched uranium can be used in bombs .
Tehran says it wants nuclear technology for civilian reasons and agreed on Sunday to clarify remaining questions about its nuclear work in the next month , the U.N. nuclear watchdog said .
The International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) said in a statement Tehran also gave the watchdog ’s head , Mohamed ElBaradei , information about work to develop an advanced centrifuge able to enrich uranium much faster than the antiquated model it uses now .
But diplomats said Tehran was stalling .

“ Answering questions about their past nuclear activities is a step , but they still need to suspend their enrichment and reprocessing activity .
Another declaration is no substitute for complying with the U.N. sanctions , ” White House spokesman Gordon Johndroe said .
ElBaradei , who met top Iranian leaders over two days last week , is anxious to see the standoff between Iran and Western powers settled peacefully , a concern underscored by a U.S. - Iranian naval incident in the Gulf a week ago .
The United States says Iranian boats threatened its warships on January 6 along the vital route for crude oil shipments from the world ’s biggest producing region .

Vice Admiral Kevin Cosgriff , commander of the Fifth Fleet , made it clear to Bush his forces took the incident “ deadly seriously ” , White House spokeswoman Dana Perino told reporters .
During a stop in Israel at the start of Bush ’s Middle East trip last week , he warned Iran of “ serious consequences ” if it attacked U.S. ships and said all options were on the table .
Tehran has dismissed the incident as routine and accused the United States of exaggerating it for propaganda purposes .
“ We exercised restraint and we very calmly announced that this was a routine procedure but they tried to ... raise this issue at the same time when Mr. Bush was traveling to the region in order to paint Iran in a negative light , ” Iran ’s Hosseini told reporters .
This breathtaking 3D landscape was constructed with high definition images taken by the High Resolution Stereo Camera ( HRSC ) on board ESA ’s Mars Express orbiter .
The new observations show Hebes Chasma , a strange mountain region nested inside the canyon , with channel - like fingers reaching out into the Martian landscape .
The imaged region shows features down to a resolution of 15 meters per pixel , an awe - inspiring view … in stereo !
The HRSC is currently looking down onto the Red Planet ’s surface , taking shots of the planet in full colour , in 3D and with a maximum resolution of two meters .
The camera design allows it unrivalled pointing accuracy by combining images at different resolutions at each orbital pass .
By imaging the landscape at three different wavelengths ( i.e. three colours ) , a stereoscopic view of Mars features give observers an insight to how the canyon will look from different angles , in 3D models .
Hebes Chasma is a very prominent Mars feature just north of the huge Valles Marineris system ( a.k.a. the “ Grand Canyon of Mars ” ) .
Hebes is described as an enclosed trough , with a high , flat - top mountain range right in the centre .
The canyon is over 8 km deep in places , and the central mountain ascends to this height , at the same level as the surrounding plains .
There is evidence to suggest that liquid water once flowed here , possibly creating a vast moat around the mountain , leaving its top isolated when the canyon was full of water .
If this natural formation was found on Earth in medieval times , I could n’t think of a better defended castle if it was built on the apex of this 8 km high range …
A number of huge images have been released , and here are links to a few of the best :
I can’t wait to see more Mars features in stunning 3D projections …

CALGARY , Alberta ( Reuters ) - Booming investment in Canada ’s oil sands and rising Brazilian crude production should more than make up for declines elsewhere in the Americas -- good news for the United States as it tries to reduce its reliance on Middle East imports , a Reuters survey showed .
The gains from northern Alberta ’s vast tar - like oil deposits and a string of discoveries off Brazil ’s coast point to shifting oil clout among Western Hemisphere countries more friendly to the United States , the world ’s top consumer .
“ What we have been seeing is relatively flat or falling supplies from Mexico and Venezuela , ” said Greg Stringham , vice - president of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers .
“ It really does open an opportunity for what I call secure , reliable supplies of oil from Canada into those markets . ”
Oil production in the Americas is set to rise by a net 150,000 barrels a day , or 0.7 percent , to 21.57 million bpd in 2008 -- equal to about a quarter of total estimated global output , according to Reuters calculations based on a survey of governments , investment banks and consultants .
Click here for a table showing the results of the survey :
< ID :N08381815 >.
Canadian output is on track to rise by nearly 7 percent to around 3 million barrels a day , excluding gas liquids from processing plants and refineries , said Martin King , analyst at FirstEnergy Capital Corp .
“ The gain that we ’re projecting there is virtually all oil sands - related , ” King said .
Two major oil sands projects , Nexen Inc's NXY .
TO $ 6.1 billion Long Lake venture and Canadian Natural Resources Ltd's CNQ.TO $ 7.8 billion Horizon development , are slated to start up this year .
Several smaller ones are also set to begin .
The overall value of planned oil sands projects and those under development is pegged at more than $ 100 billion , with nearly every oil major weathering surging costs to tap the largest oil source outside the Middle East .
BRAZIL GROWTH
Brazil could produce 2.32 million barrels a day , up 13 percent from 2007 , including output of ethanol .
Three new platforms are slated to start up , including Marlim Leste and Marlim Sul , each with a 180,000 - barrel - a- day capacity .
State - run Petrobras also expects to begin a production test at the giant Tupi oil and gas field , where it has estimated reserves as high as 8 billion barrels .
U.S. output is expected to rise slightly as large Gulf of Mexico projects start up , making up for onshore declines .
Rising supply among Washington ’s allies has political benefits in the United States .
But oil fetches a global price regardless of origin and OPEC still has a major influence on that price , said Judith Dwarkin , chief economist at Canadian research firm Ross Smith Energy Group .
World prices will react to supply disruptions whether Canadian or Venezuela crude is involved , Dwarkin said .
“ Canada is not a price maker , nor is Brazil , ” she said .
Output from OPEC member Venezuela , where President Hugo Chavez spent the past year nationalizing energy assets , could dip slightly to 2.43 million barrels , the survey said , well below claims by the government .
The drop is blamed on a lack of investment and the impact of damage to facilities sustained in a crippling oil industry strike in 2002 and 2003 , and comes after 2006 output was reduced by maintenance on heavy crude upgrader projects .
In Mexico , production may fall by 180,000 barrels a day to 3.32 million , due largely to declines at the giant Cantarell field , the country ’s largest crude source .
Those declines are big drivers behind a push by pipeline companies to build new capacity to Texas , hub of the largest U.S. refining region , from faraway Canada .
Already , producers ship supplies as far as Oklahoma , well beyond the traditional U.S. Midwest market for Canadian crude .
“ The issues are Mexican decline and Venezuela as a wild card , but in the grand scheme of things , longer term , Canadian crude is going down south to the U.S. Gulf Coast , ” said Steve Fekete , a market analyst with consultants Purvin & Gertz .

I like to link to waiter oriented websites that I find funny or interesting .
When I provide a link I write the proprietor of that website , tell them about the link , and ask of they would link to my site in return .
Just a couple of bloggers trying to increase traffic at each others sites .
It ’s a “ you scratch my back I scratch yours ” kinda deal .
Well today someone tried to scratch my eyes out .

Dear waiter ,
Thanks for the compliment .
I mulled over how I could decline your invitation without sounding offensive , and my best bet is simply by telling you the truth .
Did you read my site ?
I had one horrible boss who was always masturbating to porn in his office , accidentally leaving his door open for me to see everything .
I read your site .
Your references to porn , saving up images in your head for future sessions , etc. , offended me and are exactly what I hate about being an attractive woman who works with men .
Everyone who frequents my site knows this .
No offense .
It is just the truth .
You and everyone else can say whatever the heck you like on the Internet .
It is your site .
However , I wo n’t be linking to you unless you have some kind of emotional awakening about the harm caused by pornography to the male ( and female ) psyche .
Not likely , I know , but drop me a line if that happens .
And good luck finding another long - term romantic relationship .
That is not a bitchy statement ; I am being sincere .
Take care , waiter .
I am sorry to not help another server , but my gut churned over this one .
I just ca n’t do it .

Oh boy .
Someone ’s running low on Prozac .
Jen , whatever opinions you have about pornography are yours and that ’s ok .
Mentioning , however , you are an attractive woman in your email makes me suspect you harbor an inflated opinion about your own appearance .
Those secure in their self image do n’t need to flaunt it .
You are a really pissed off chick .
The crack about my love life was gratuitous and cruel .
You not only despise your job – you probably despise yourself .
Get some therapy or ask the doctor to increase the dosage .
Hey – I ’m just being sincere .

WASHINGTON  President Bush used the fifth anniversary of the start of the war in Iraq on Wednesday to make the case for persevering in a conflict that could have many more anniversaries .
Democrats accused him of lacking a strategy to win and withdraw .
Mr. Bush , speaking before members of the armed forces and defense officials at the Pentagon , said in his frankest acknowledgment yet that the costs of the war , in lives and money , had been higher and longer lasting than he had anticipated .
But he remained unwavering in his insistence that the invasion of Iraq , which began in March 2003 , had made the world better and the United States safer .
“ Five years into this battle , there is an understandable debate over whether the war was worth fighting , whether the fight is worth winning , and whether we can win it , ” he said .
“ The answers are clear to me .
Removing Saddam Hussein from power was the right decision , and this is a fight that America can and must win . ”
Bill de hÓra and then Patrick Logan picked up on an old post of mine about monkeypatching .
Patrick ’s reply :
I know next to nothing about the specific problems the Ruby and Python folks are encountering with “ monkeypatching ” .
However this capability is nothing new for dynamic languages .
And it is a frequent desire for me when I program in C - like languages .
If you become frustrated using static “ utility ” methods , for example in Java , that work with “ closed ” classes ( say , String or Object ) , then you have at least some desire for these “ monkeypatches ” .
See the thing is this capability is a cool feature in many Lisp and most Smalltalk systems .
Sorry , dear readers who hate my Smug Lisp Weeniness .
But it is true .
Not only is it “ cool , ” moreover it is pragmatic .
The truly good implementations of dynamic languages recognize the advantages of these kinds of extensions , and they ’ve supported them with good tools for decades .
Learn from it , do n’t run from it .
Sharp tools are good .
I would not want monkeypatching removed from Python .
Still , it ’s best not to leave sharp tools lying around .
It ’s best not to mix your butter knives with your steak knives .
I do n’t resent the safety guards on circular saws .
And sorry Lisp Weenies : your experiences are not so novel anymore .
The Python community is n’t new to this dynamic typing thing .
We ’ve taken some hits and we ’ve learned from them .
And frankly the problems with runtime patching of methods ca n’t be specific to Python or Ruby .
It only took the Ruby community a couple years to start catching on .
Are you telling me Lisp and Smalltalk programmers still have n’t figured this out ?
Everything you value about modularity is at risk when you monkeypatch code .
That risk can be worth it , of course !
But do you really need me to explain the benefits of modularity ?
What ’s next , a recap of the problems with GOTO ?
One of the things that I think distinguishes Python among the popular dynamically typed languages of the day , is that it ’s built — languages and libraries — on a great deal of concrete experience .
Experience about developing with Python .
There was a time when people tended to define Python as a delta from Java or Perl or C .
We do n’t need to do that anymore .
Sure , closed classes in Java suck .
Python is n’t a reaction to Java ’s suckiness .
That we can do something Java ca n’t does n’t get me excited .
This feature of monkeypatching has to stand up on its own , and while sometimes its use is justified those cases are few and far between .
That ’s what we ’ve learned : monkeypatching was not dismissed out of hand , it was not dismissed because of anything in Java , it was dismissed because people used it without acknowledging it as a hack , and it sucked .
Of course the use cases are still there .
Which is why people are trying new things to address these problems .
One benefit of experience is that you know some paths are dead ends .
We still have n’t figured out The One Right Path ( and we never will ) , and maybe we ’ve only traced out the longest path in a very long dead end in this maze of ideas we are traversing .
Since I doubt the maze has any exit ( nirvana ? ) it ’s a valid debate about where we are trying to get at all .
That said , I suspect we ’ve out - explored Lisp .
Lisp has been a worthy mentor , an intrepid explorer in his time , but he ’s old and does n’t get out much and only tells stories of where he ’s been in the past .
There are still things to be learned there , wisdom to be dug out of that environment , but Lisp and Python are not peers .
DIGG THIS
Strange how campaign season leads to the usual political drama over taxes .
Republicans have learned the hard way that they should never raise them , at least not in ways that are noticeable .
They accuse Democrats of plotting secret increases .
The Democrats deny it but draw attention to mounting debt and hint that solving the problem will require serious measures .
These serious measures might involve sacrifice .
The voters are suspicious .
And so the battle lines are drawn .
This observation is prompted by the disgusting fact that President Bush is running around the country saying that he will never raise taxes .
Meanwhile , he is one of the greatest spenders in history .
When it comes to his war , he will spend into oblivion .
He has been the same on domestic spending too , but for a few high - profile cases of opposing programs that benefit his political enemies .
If this were the 19th century , the debate and drama would make sense .
Some politicians believe that the public ’s money is up for grabs .
Others think that the people ought to keep their own .
So it was .
What appears to be a battle over fundamental ideology and political philosophy is , however , a complete illusion in our time .
There is one reason : the central bank .
This is what has changed everything .
No longer are taxes the main way the federal government guarantees its liquidity and funds its empire .
If the state had to tax us for everything it spent , the country would be obviously and fiscally bankrupt instead of being covertly and financially bankrupt as it is in fact .
This has been partially true for nearly a hundred years , but the restrictions on the Fed ’s ability to print all the money the government needs have been systematically eliminated , ever more each year .
The more money the state needs , the more it has turned to the Fed to pull its financial trickery .
So today there are two ways the state can extract money from the population : stealing or counterfeiting .
The political class favors the latter to the former .
What ’s best for the country and the economy , taxes or credit expansion ?
That ’s a tough call .
Republicans are right that new taxes can cause recession .
Democrats are right that government just can’t keep accumulating debt forever without regard to the eventual results .
Arguably , monetary expansion is worse because it breeds the political lie that the state can spend and spend all it wants and never collect .
That ’s the big lie that central banking makes possible .
The smaller lies come in the form of promises not to raise taxes .
Bush is the overlord of a Fed that keeps driving down interest rates even in the face of the aftereffects of previous credit expansions , such as that in the housing market .
In fact , inflationary credit does have a cost .
It diminishes the purchasing power of the dollar .
We are being robbed year by year , and it makes no moral difference that we ’ve all somehow gotten used to it .
There are also the tremendous economic distortions that come with the practice .
Inflationary credit has the effect of subsidizing some sectors beyond sustainable levels and generates waves of entrepreneurial ( and consumer ) errors .
The business cycle itself can be laid squarely at the door of the money temple .
So the real question to ask is who wants to do something to restrain the power of the Fed ?
The answer is no one but Ron Paul .
The Republicans and Democrats love the Fed for its magical capacity to generate resources out of thin air .
It is the Fed that guarantees the bonds that the government floats to raise its revenue .
It is the Fed that makes it possible for these bonds to not bear any kind of risk premium since , unlike the debt of private corporations and local governments , they are guaranteed against failure .
Ron Paul brings up this issue at every campaign stop .
This alone is proof that he is not telling voters only what they want to hear .
Who wants to hear about monetary policy ?
Hardly anyone until he made it an issue .
Now we have a generation of young people who are suddenly aware that there is something profoundly wrong with a system that gives the political classes and the bureaucratic machine a blank check to do whatever they want , while still allowing Republicans to pretend to be fiscal conservatives .
His book The Case for Gold is garnering ever - new attention , and rightly so because he presents a rationale and plan for restoring honest money that the people and not the government controls .
What is the strongest case for gold ?
That it would end inflation and the business cycle ?
Those are benefits but not the main one .
The gold standard would dramatically restrain the state , which is the essence of freedom .
It would force the political class to come to us and ask for tax increases whenever it wanted to expand , and thereupon the population would likely say no .
This is the reason politicians hate gold .
Remember this when the tax debate gets fired up again .
It ’s true that new taxes would be terrible .
It would also be great to cut taxes more .
But it is pointless to talk only about this one form of raising revenue when the other form continues to be the great unmentionable subject in American political life .
So long as the state spends and piles up the debt , the bill will be paid by someone at some point .

BillO obviously is feeling some heat over his vile words the other day when he compared Hitler and the KKK to some anonymous commenter 's on the Huffington Post and attacking Arianna .
In his perverted defense , he says that the use of propaganda by the Nazis to murder millions of Jews is an honest comparison to some idiots leaving comments on a blog .
Download Download ( h/t billw )
O'Reiily : ... from the late nineteen twenties to nineteen thirty three when Hitler became chancellor , the Nazis used vile propaganda to demonize Jews and others in the eyes of the German people .
The used newspapers , radio , leaflets and rallies to build up enormous hatred towards your family .
Today we 're seeing the same thing on the net here in America , there is no difference .
When Arianna Huffington allows people to say that Nancy Reagan should suffer terribly and then die , that is no different that what doctor Joseph Goebbels and others were putting out way back then .
What an ignorant fool .
Yea , a few commenter 's on blogs are in some way equal to Hitler and his mass rallies that led millions of people to their demise and are as evil as the KKK and the Nazis in O'Reilly 's world .
Right wing demagogues will say absolutely anything to justify their insane actions .
Rarely if ever , BillO will take a look at right wing sites to see what they are up to as Steve Young points out .
I know you wo n't because you never have .
You 've always said that the Right 's smears are minuscule as compared to the Left's .
What , you 've never listened to talk radio ?
You 've never gone through the tons of right wing sites ?

SNL insists it 's not boosting Clinton Nick Juliano
Published : Friday March 14 , 2008

Print This Email This Writers said to prefer Obama , producers donate 10 K to Clinton A sketch on Saturday Night Live before this month 's Texas and Ohio primaries was seen by some as shifting the campaign narrative in favor of Senator Hillary Clinton .
The long - running comedy show dinged the news media for its perceived bias in favor of Barack Obama , and , subsequently , many reporters appeared to grow more adversarial towards the upstart candidate .
Clinton herself frequently invoked the sketch , which parodied a recent Democratic debate , and Obama joked that he was going to call the show 's creator , Lorne Michaels , to complain .
The same week the debate sketch aired , former SNL head writer Tina Fey returned to host the show .
During its weekend update segment she delivered an impassioned defense of Clinton , taking on perception that Clinton is a " bitch . "
Fey described herself the same way and declared : " Bitches get stuff done .
...
It 's not too late .
Texas and Ohio , get on board .
Bitch is the new black . "
Michaels and other writes and producers on the show defended their neutrality to the Los Angeles Times Thursday .
" I can assure you that there 's no agenda , " Michaels said , " that there 's only a reaction to what 's going in the world . "
Michaels has donated to candidates of both parties , including Republican nominee John McCain .
On the Democratic side , though , his pick is already gone from the race -- the SNL creator donated $ 4,600 to Sen.
Chris Dodd ( D - CT ) last year , although half of that was for a now - nonexistent general election campaign , according to a RAW STORY review of campaign finance records .
Among SNL 's cadre of still - active writers and producers listed on the Internet Movie Database , only one was found to have donated to Obama 's campaign , according to the review .
Seth Myers , one of the show 's head writers , gave Obama $ 1,000 in January .
Michaels and writer Jim Downey , who created most of the show 's political sketches , tell the New York Times that most of the staff , like Myers , favor Obama .
The sketches that seemed to benefit Clinton were aired because they were funny .
 Im sensitive to the suggestion that were in the service of Hillary Clinton this year ,  Michaels told the Times .
 That obviously is not the case . 
He added ,  We dont lay down for anybody . 
Clinton appeared on the show March 1 , but she delivered lines written by the show 's staff , not her own aides , during the brief appearance .
Obama made his own cameo on SNL around Halloween .
While the SNL writers are said to favor Obama , a review of the producers ' political donations shows a decided Clinton bent .
Producers have donated more than $ 10,000 to Clinton 's presidential and Senate campaigns in recent years .
Robert Smigel , who writes SNL's TV Funhouse animated skits , and his wife , Michelle , have donated at least $ 5,100 to Clinton 's various campaigns , according to a search of the Center for Responsive Politics database .
For his part , Obama 's not worried about the perceived bias .
" Frankly , Barack Obama knows he 's good enough , smart enough and , gosh darn it , he 's won more states , more votes and more delegates , and that 's what probably matters more anyway , " Obama spokesman Bill Burton quipped to the LA Times , à la Stuart Smalley .
Since its inception in 1975 , SNL has skewered politicians from Gerald Ford , played as a bumbling klutz by Chevy Chase , to the " strategery " - formulating George W. Bush perfected by Will Ferrell .
Amy Poehler , whose portrayal of Hillary Clinton has been seen as a boon for the former First Lady , tells the LA Times the show tries to be against " whoever is winning . "
Whatever roll the show played in reviving Clinton 's campaign before the Texas and Ohio primaries , the intensified interest on politics has certainly helped boost ratings .
The Feb. 23 episode , the first broadcast after the writer 's strike ended which sported the debate sketch , attracted 7.5 million viewers , the most the show has garnered in a year .
" We 're hoping for a dead tie in the delegates so it , like , goes on for another year , " Meyers joked to the LA Times .
" They have to postpone the general election . "
Researchers Muriel Kane and Michael Petrelis contributed to this report .
According to campaign finance database NewsMeat , the following SNL producers donated to Clinton 's presidential or Senate campaigns : Samantha Scharff -- $ 500 on Jan. 10 , 2008
Marci Klein -- $ 2,000 on Aug. 16 , 2007
James Signorelli -- $ 1,000 on Aug. 16 , 2007
Lauren Leeds -- $ 4,600 ( for primary and general elections ) on Dec. 31 , 2007
Lauren Leeds -- $ 2,000 on Aug. 10 , 2006 .
Hillary Clinton mentioned the following SNL sketch several times on the campaign trail after it aired Feb.

The next week , Clinton appeared on the show to deliver its famous , " Live from New York , " line :
Begala : ' Nothing but contempt ' for Clinton adviser Penn Nick Juliano
Published : Friday April 11 , 2008

Print This Email This Meanwhile , Penn spotted lunching with Bush confidant A longtime Clinton ally compared Mark Penn 's ability to hold onto a job in Hillary Clinton 's campaign to Donald Rumsfeld 's prolonged term atop the Pentagon .
Paul Begala , who worked on Bill Clinton 's 1992 presidential campaign , expressed contempt for the embattled pollster , who was removed as Clinton 's chief strategist last week after news emerged that he was lobbying for a free - trade deal Clinton opposes ( Penn continues to work for the campaign ) .
The Huffington Post reports : " I have nothing but contempt for Mr. Penn , " said Begala at a New York City breakfast sponsored by the non-profit group Public Agenda .
" And for those of us who wanted to see him out from the beginning , it became almost a Rumsfeldian thing .
And he is not even fired .
He has been demoted .
How could this be ? "
Penn was demoted after reports that he was working with the Colombian government to help it secure expanded trade privileges with the US that Sen.
Clinton does not support .
He remains a top player in Clinton 's campaign , despite his demotion , according to several reports .
The kerfuffle that resulted from his meeting with Colombia apparently has n't dissuaded Penn from taking meetings that could leave questionable impressions .
The Washington Post's In The Loop reports he had lunch this week with a former Bush administration official .
Spotted at lunch Wednesday at the pricey D.C. restaurant Il Mulino : Mark Penn , Burson - Marsteller chief and former chief strategist and major player in Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton 's presidential campaign .
His luncheon companion ?
None other than Karen P. Hughes , longtime Bush aide , White House counselor and State Department public diplomacy czar .
We 're told mutual friends arranged this as a " get - to - know - you lunch " while she was in town for a State Department public diplomacy award .
But what would the two PR wizards have discussed ?
Obviously not politics .
Maybe Hughes , who surely would have a number of potential Mideast clients -- despite having had some rocky days over there -- would come work for Penn 's firm ?
Maybe a little chit - chat over their favorite PR strategies ?
NAFTA ?
It 's been an open secret for a while that Penn , who joined Team Clinton during Bill Clinton 's 1996 re-election campaign , is widely disliked inside the Clinton team , as a recent Washington Post article noted , quoting several unnamed advisers venting about Penn 's perceived failures .
One New York adviser quoted in the piece said Penn should have been fired because he " failed the campaign in developing a message and evolving the message as things changed . "
The article said Begala was among several longtime Clinton allies to " openly despise [ Penn ] , and some even nicknamed him ' Schlumbo . ' "
Speaking at the breakfast Friday , Begala blamed Penn 's ill - conceived game plan for giving Barack Obama the edge in the nomination battle , according to the Huffington Post .
( Begala said it currently looked like Obama would take the nomination ) .
" Mark Penn did have this strategy , " Begala said .
" He wrote a book called Microtrends in which he argued that the era of big trends is over .
That 's like going to New Orleans before Katrina and saying the era of big storms is over .
It might end up being true but it could be really wrong . "
Taking more , often humor - laden swipes , Begala went on : " [ Penn ] is looking to target non-Catholic Latino woman .
All two of them ...
He slices the baloney incredibly thin .
And in addition to being a political strategist , he is heading one of the biggest public relations firm in Washington , which is a huge conflict of interest .
The campaign ended up looking like Exxon Mobil instead of what it really is ... "
Begala 's comments on Penn 's tenure as chief strategist are some of the harshest yet to emanate from within the broader Clinton circle .
In the wake of Penn 's decision to meet with the Colombian ambassador to the U.S. -- to discuss the promotion of a trade deal that Sen.
Clinton opposes -- other advisers to the senator ( notably Pennsylvania Governor Ed Rendell ) hinted their disapproval and desire to see Penn fired .
Politico's Ben Smith notes that Begala is a " key consultant to Progressive Media USA , the new Democratic independent money group . "
Sen. Charles Schumer , D - N.Y. , left , a superdelegate and Clinton supporter , stands next to her at the swearing - in ceremony of Gov. David Paterson .
Democrats would lose independent voters if Clinton won the nomination based on superdelegates , a poll finds .

WASHINGTON  A majority of Democratic voters say it would be unfair for Hillary Rodham Clinton to win the presidential nomination through the support of " super delegates " if she lags among the convention delegates elected in primaries and caucuses , according to a USA TODAY / Gallup Poll .
If that happens , one in five say they would n't vote for the New York senator in the general election .
FULL RESULTS : Potential voters sound off on Clinton , Obama and McCain
The findings in the survey , taken Friday through Sunday , underscore some of the perils ahead for Democrats as the closely fought nomination battle between Clinton and Illinois Sen. Barack Obama continues .
By 55%-37 % , Democrats and independents who " lean " Democratic say an outcome in which Clinton lost among pledged delegates but prevailed with the help of super delegates would be " flawed " and unfair " — including 77 % of Obama supporters and 28 % of Clinton supporters .
Super delegates are party leaders and elected officials who can vote at the national convention and are n't bound by the results of their state 's primary or caucus .
Most at risk is Democratic support from independents .
Nearly two - thirds of those voters call that result unfair , and one - third say they would then vote for the Republican or stay home in November .
" It goes back to this notion :
As this race winds down , it 's not how we started the campaign , it 's how we end it , " says Donna Brazile , campaign manager for Al Gore 's 2000 campaign , expressing concern that divisions in the party will present " obstacles " to a Democratic victory in November .
" I feel the emotions on both sides , " says Brazile , herself an uncommitted super delegate .
" I feel the pain and I feel the bruising . "
Obama leads Clinton by 1,617 delegates to 1,498 , according to an Associated Press count .
Neither candidate is likely to reach the 2,024 needed for nomination without including the support of super delegates .
The two campaigns have clashed over whether the super delegates should feel obligated to support the candidate with the most pledged delegates .
In the nationwide poll , Obama leads Clinton 49 % - 42 % among Democrats and Democratic - leaning independents , a narrower margin than his record 12 - percentage - point lead late last month .
In another shift from the February survey , Clinton does better than Obama against the presumptive Republican nominee , Arizona Sen .
John McCain , though the numbers are within the poll 's margin of error of +/—3 points .
Clinton beats McCain by 51 % - 46 % . Obama leads McCain by 49 % - 47 % .
The survey of 1,025 adults also asked Americans to assess the traits of the major presidential contenders .
Among the findings : • Obama rates highest on five of 10 characteristics .
He is seen as a candidate who " understands the problems Americans face in their daily lives " and " would work well with both parties in Washington to get things done . "
His weakest showing was in having " a clear plan for solving the country 's problems . "
•McCain ranks first on three characteristics :
As " a strong and decisive leader , " as honest and trustworthy , and as someone who could " manage the government efficiently . "
His lowest rating also is on having a clear plan to solve the nation 's problems .
• Clinton rates highest on two traits , on having a vision for the country 's future and a clear plan for solving the nation 's problems .
Her lowest rating is as someone who is honest and trustworthy .

WASHINGTON  Former Attorney General John Ashcroft responded angrily on Tuesday to Congressional Democrats who suggested that a no- bid private contract awarded to him by the Justice Department last year amounted to a “ backroom , sweetheart deal ” that would earn his consulting firm tens of millions of dollars .
“ There is not a conflict , there is not an appearance of a conflict , ” Mr. Ashcroft said at a hearing of a House Judiciary subcommittee called to explore the circumstances of the contract .
He repeatedly tried to talk over the panel ’s Democratic chairwoman , Representative Linda T. Sanchez of California , who offered the harshest questioning of Mr. Ashcroft , a Republican .
The former attorney general stepped down from the Justice Department three years ago and now runs a Washington consulting firm that bears his name .
Ms. Sanchez opened the hearing by suggesting that the department ’s decision last year to award a monitoring contract worth between $ 28 million to $ 52 million to Mr. Ashcroft ’s firm , as part of an out - of - court settlement with a medical supply company under criminal investigation , presented the appearance of a conflict , since it was made by officials who had been Mr. Ashcroft ’s subordinates .

Australian men are avoiding marriage because of the financial ruin marital break - ups bring .
New figures show that a quarter of all women will never be proposed to as men opt for no-strings - attached casual relationships .
Today 29 per cent of men are likely never to marry and the trend is rising .
And recent Family Court rulings which force men to pay for child support for children that are not their own have only reinforced widespread perceptions of anti-male bias by the court .
There are now more than two million Australian men and women in the lonely hearts club - those 45 years and under who have never married .
On current trends the club is likely to double over the next 15 years .
Men are opting for relationships where there is no commitment , no offspring and most of all no danger of long - term financial loss from divorce .
And statistics also show that if a woman wants to marry the worst thing she can do is get a university degree , which pushes out the marriage age and lengthens the odds of never marrying .
University degrees produce the most old maids ( almost twice as many women with university degrees are not married at 45 compared with women with no qualifications at all ) .
Women with diplomas fare almost as badly , ahead of women with basic certificates and those with no qualifications at all .
Women with trade certificates appear to have the best prospects of getting married .
Just 5 per cent of tradeswomen aged 45 are not married .
" I think it is wonderful that men are starting to wake up , " family law reform campaigner Sylvia Smith said last week .
" Why would a young man with a lucrative career risk losing 70 to 80 per cent of his assets by getting married ?
" Property settlements are meant to be 50/50 but in the vast majority of cases the result is more like 80 /20 towards women . "
The Full Bench of the Family Court recently ruled that it had no power to force the Child Support Agency to refund $ 4290 in overpayments to a Victorian man who discovered by DNA tests that he was not the father of his wife 's child .
In another case currently before the Family Court , also in Victoria , a man is seeking repayment of about $ 40,000 in child support payments after he also discovered that two of the three children he had been supporting for 8 1/2 years turned out through DNA testing not to be his .
The Child Support Agency insists it has no power to refund the money , and Children and Youth Affairs Minister Larry Anthony says he is seeking advice on the matter .
The Family Law Act of 1975 ushered in not only the era of no - fault divorce and high dissolution rates ( currently running 46 per cent ) , but a corresponding trend of an increasing reluctance to marry .
Since 1975 there has been a five - fold growth in the number of men who have never married .
In 1975 , 4 per cent or about one in 25 women had never married by the time they reached 45 years of age .
According to the 1996 Census ( the 2001 Census figures are due to be released soon ) , more than one in four women had never married by the age of 45 , and this figure is continuing to rise .
Between 1986 and 1996 there was a rise in the number of women living in de facto relationships from 7 per cent to 12 per cent in the 25 - to 29 - year age group .
However , the proportion of married women fell by 15 per cent so that the proportion of women in 1996 who were coupled in any type of live - in union fell from 67 per cent to 57 per cent .
The number of people getting married is also falling , despite the increasing population .
In 2000 there was a decrease of 900 marriages compared with the previous year .
Men and women are also delaying getting married , with the average age of men getting married now 30 , and women almost 28 .
In 1971 an extraordinary 62 per cent of women aged between 20 and 24 were married .
By 1997 this figure had fallen to 13 per cent .

Marriage is found to be associated with substantially lower rates of mortality , for both men and women .
Married men are predicted to be some - 7.2 percent less likely to die over the period [ 1993 to 2000 ] than unmarried men .
For women , the effect is smaller .
Women married in 1991 are approximately - 4.1 percent less likely to die over the period 1993 to 2000 than otherwise similar unmarried women .

The planned destruction of the family was part of the communist agenda from its inception by Karl Marx and Frederic Engels .
It became government policy in the USSR in about 1917 .
It was so successful in the USSR that it threatened to destroy society in the USSR .
Curiously , while in the 1940s the USSR took steps to repair the damages its family - hostile policies had caused , American communists imported the Soviet agenda for the planned destruction of the family into the USA .
It has been and continues to be promoted by left - leaning liberals in the West ever since .
UC Berkeley Press Release
New technique captures chemical reactions in a single living cell for the first time
– Bioengineers at the University of California , Berkeley , have discovered a technique that for the first time enables the detection of biomolecules ' dynamic reactions in a single living cell .
By taking advantage of the signature frequency by which organic and inorganic molecules absorb light , the team of researchers , led by Luke Lee , professor of bioengineering and director of UC Berkeley 's Biomolecular Nanotechnology Center , can determine in real time whether specific enzymes are activated or particular genes are expressed , all with unprecedented resolution within a single living cell .
( Graphic by Gang Logan Liu and Luke Lee / UC Berkeley )
The technique , described in the Nov. 18 issue of the journal Nature Methods , could lead to a new era in molecular imaging with implications for cell - based drug discovery and biomedical diagnostics .
The researchers point out that other techniques , such as nuclear magnetic resonance , can at best provide information about a cluster of cells .
But to determine the earliest signs of disease progression or of stem cell proliferation , it 's necessary to drill down deeper to the molecular dynamics within a single cell .
To study the biochemical processes of a cell , scientists currently cut through its outer membrane to separate and analyze the cellular components .
That method can never provide a real - time view of how components function together because the cell is killed in the process of extracting its components .
" Until now , there has been no non-invasive method that exists that can capture the chemical fingerprints of molecules with nanoscale spatial resolution within a single living cell , " said Lee , who is also a faculty affiliate of the California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences and the co-director of the Berkeley Sensor and Actuator Center .
" There is great hope that stem cells can one day be used to treat diseases , but one of the biggest challenges in this field is understanding exactly how individual cells differentiate .
What is happening inside a stem cell as it develops into a heart muscle instead of a tooth or a strand of hair ?
To find out , we need to look at the telltale chemical signals involved as proteins and genes function together within a cell . "
The researchers tackled this challenge by improving upon conventional optical absorption spectroscopy , a technique by which light is passed through a solution of molecules to determine which wavelengths are absorbed .
Cytochrome c , for instance , is a protein involved in cell metabolism and cell death that has several optical absorption peaks of around 550 nanometers .
The absorption spectra of a molecule can change based upon the chemical changes that occur as it interacts with other molecules , such as oxygen .
" For conventional optical absorption spectroscopy to work , a relatively high concentration of biomolecules and a large volume of solution is needed in order to detect these subtle changes in frequencies and absorption peaks , " said Lee .
" That 's because optical absorption signals from a single biomolecule are very weak , so you need to kill hundreds to millions of cells to fish out enough of the target molecule for detection . "
The researchers came up with a novel solution to this problem by coupling biomolecules , the protein cytochrome c in this study , with tiny particles of gold measuring 20 - 30 nanometers long .
The electrons on the surface of metal particles such as gold and silver are known to oscillate at specific frequencies in response to light , a phenomenon known as plasmon resonance .
The resonant frequencies of the gold nanoparticles are much easier to detect than the weak optical signals of cytochrome c , giving the researchers an easier target .
Gold nanoparticles were chosen because they have a plasmon resonance wavelength ranging from 530 to 580 nanometers , corresponding to the absorption peak of cytochrome c .
" When the absorption peak of the biomolecule overlaps with the plasmon resonance frequency of the gold particle , you can see whether they are exchanging energy , " said study co-lead author Gang Logan Liu , who conducted the research as a UC Berkeley Ph.D. student in bioengineering .
" This energy transfer shows up as small dips , something we call ' quenching , ' in the characteristic absorption peak of the gold particle . "
A relatively small concentration of the molecule is needed to create these quenching dips , so instead of a concentration of millions of molecules , researchers can get by with hundreds or even dozens of molecules .
The sensitivity and selectivity of the quenching dips will improve the molecular diagnosis of diseases and be instrumental in the development of personalized medicine , the researchers said .
The researchers repeated the experiment matching the protein hemoglobin with silver nanoparticles and achieved similar results .
" Our technique kills two birds with one stone , " Lee said .
" We 're reducing the spatial resolution required to detect the molecule at the same time we 're able to obtain chemical information about molecules while they are in a living cell .
In a way , these gold particles are like ' nano - stars ' because they illuminate the inner life of a cellular galaxy . "
Other researchers on the UC Berkeley team are Yi- Tao Long , co-lead author and postdoctoral scholar in bioengineering ; Yeonho Choi , a Ph.D. student in mechanical engineering ; and Taewook Kang , a postdoctoral scholar in bioengineering .
The Ministry of Science and Technology in Korea helped support this research .
PRINCETON , NJ -- For several days , nationwide Democratic voters ' preferences have been shifting toward Barack Obama in Gallup Poll Daily election tracking .
Now , the Illinois senator enjoys his first statistically significant lead , 49 % to 42 % , over Hillary Clinton , according to the Feb. 13 -15 results .
Additionally , the 49 % support for Obama represents the high point for him in the daily tracking program .
Obama has won the last eight Democratic primaries or caucuses , and hopes to make it 10 straight on Tuesday in Wisconsin and Hawaii .
The tracking data reflect the Obama momentum since the Feb .
5 Super Tuesday primaries , moving from a +13 Clinton advantage in Feb. 3 - 5 polling to a +7 Obama lead in the latest results .
John McCain continues to be the choice of the majority of Republican voters nationwide .
Fifty - four percent name McCain as their preferred nominee , with 28 % choosing Mike Huckabee .
McCain 's support has been above 50 % since the Feb.6 - 8 tracking results , roughly coinciding with Mitt Romney 's exit from the campaign .

Methodology :
The results reported here are based on combined data from Feb.
13 -15 , 2008 , including interviews with 999 Republican and Republican - leaning voters , and 1,223 Democratic and Democratic - leaning voters .
For results based on these samples , the maximum margin of sampling error is ±3 percentage points .
In addition to sampling error , question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls .
Gandhi Peace Brigade / 400 Fasters Join Leslie
By CodePink DC
Today is the 21st day of Leslie ’s Hungry for Justice ?
Impeach him FAST ! to pressure Congressman John Conyers and the House Judiciary Committee to begin impeachment proceedings against Vice President Dick Cheney .
400 people from Vancouver , Washington to Kennebunkport , Maine , have joined the fast , with more signing on every day .
Unfortunately , Leslie ’s not feeling well .
Last summer she was taken to the hospital for dehydration during her Lieberman fast and at the time she promised her son she would end her fasts before jeopardizing her health .
We do n’t want to lose the momentum established over these past three weeks , so we ’re asking for your help .
She would like to ceremoniously break bread in Congressman Conyers ’ office to end her fast and then pass on the leadership role to a successor .
This person would continue the fast and visit Conyers ’ and other Judiciary Members ’ offices until the next successor takes over , and so on , and so on … until Congressman Conyers begins impeachment hearings .
If you would like to take on a leadership role for the fast , please let us know .
If you ca n’t come to DC , but you still want to participate in the fast for a day or longer , please sign up here : http://codepinkalert.org/article.php?id=3974.
The fast coincides with an exciting new development in New Hampshire , where the state legislature began hearings on House Resolution 24 , calling for impeachment proceedings against Bush and Cheney .
The hearings have been spearheaded by Representative Betty Hall , a 14 - term legislator .
If the impeachment resolution passes , New Hampshire would join the Vermont Senate and 91 cities in a grassroots call for accountability .
This past week Leslie visited all of the Democratic Judiciary members offices to set up appointments for Betty Hall and her to talk about supporting impeachment hearings and signing onto the Wexler letter .
http://www.wexlerforcongress.com/news.asp?ItemID=230
“ The call for impeachment continues to grow , ” says David Swanson of After Downing Street http://www.afterdowningstreet.org/fasting.
“ If we get just three more members of the Judiciary Committee to come out for impeachment hearings , that will represent a majority of Democrats on the Committee , which will really turn up the heat on Chairman Conyers .
The Impeachment Fast and the new developments in New Hampshire are helping to build the momentum . ”
The following Judiciary Committee members are the most likely to sign onto the Wexler letter .
Please call them …
* Rep. Zoe Lofgren ( 202-225-3072 )
* Rep. Melvin Watt ( 202-225-1510 )
* Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee ( 202-225-3816 )
* Rep. Bobby Scott ( 202-225-8351 , Mon. - Fri. )
Also , please continue to call Congressman Conyers ( 202-225-5126 , Mon. - Fri. ) .
Thank you for your support !

I ( along with anyone else who respects the Constitution ) say that the best cure for bad speech is more speech , not censorship .
However , I frequently hear a whiny retort to that :
With the internet , things are different .
There is some merit to that argument , since a lie can be spread worldwide in a mere click of a button – splaying falsehoods from Topeka to Taipei .
Under those conditions , what is the victim of such a falsehood to do ?
Jon Garfunkel makes a very good case for a fascinating way to combat this — and he does n’t call for any ill - conceived new torts , nor does he call for a repeal to Section 230 .
Instead , Garfunkel seeks to harness the power of the free market to correct irregularities in the marketplace of ideas .
He calls for a nonprofit to create a system whereby people who post information ( especially responses to false information ) under penalty of perjury .
There would also be a nominal fee ( paid to the nonprofit ) for filing notarized statements ; they would be greater than zero , but less than court & legal fees .
In addition , the system could begin to develop an arbitration process for handling the online torts of defamation and privacy exposure if the injured party does not want to pursue it in the courts .
The oath is accepted as a test for sworn truth because there are penalties for lying : the crime of perjury .
It ’s not so clear that frank truth has a similar correcting mechanism .
Neither Wikileaks nor AutoAdmit ( nor many other online communities of discussion ) appear to have any regular processes for evaluating the claims made on their site for truthfulness ; everything is to be taken with the proverbial grain of salt .
It ’s possible they get at the truth , but it may ultimately be irrelevant to their success .
( source )
What a great idea .
I can see a few classes of people who would n’t support it :
The whiny PC types , they want censorship of anything that could possibly make anyone “ feel bad . ”
Unethical lawyers would n’t like it either – it would diminish their ability to suck legal fees from whipping their clients into a frenzy .
The extremely wealthy and powerful would n’t like it either — since it would essentially destroy the ability to file a SLAPP suit .
The rest of us would benefit from unfettered free speech with a verifiable right of reply .
Mr. Garfunkel , please come on down and accept your First Amendment Bad Ass award !

The CIA operation that should have prevented the Iraq war
According to Tawfiq , Saddam Hussein gave the order to dismantle Iraq 's weapons of mass destruction programmes in 1995 , after his brother - in - law and arms chief Hussein Kamel defected and briefed the UN inspectors .
by Staff Writers
Amman ( AFP ) Feb 4 , 2008
When Saad Tawfiq watched Colin Powell 's presentation to the United Nations on February 5 2003 he shed bitter tears as he realised he had risked his life and those of his loved ones for nothing .
As one of Saddam Hussein 's most gifted engineers , Tawfiq knew that the Iraqi dictator had shut down his nuclear , chemical and biological weapons programmes in 1995 -- and he had told his handlers in US intelligence just that .
And yet here was the then US secretary of state -- Tawfiq 's television was able to received international news through a link pirated from Saddam 's spies next door -- waving a vial of white powder and telling the UN Security Council a story about Iraqi germ labs .
" When I saw Colin Powell I started crying .
Immediately .
I knew I had tried and lost , " Tawfiq told AFP five years later in the Jordanian capital Amman .
Now in his fifties , a round - faced man with a small moustache and lively eyes behind delicate spectacles , Tawfiq described how the CIA set up an elaborate operation to recruit Iraqi weapons scientists and then ignored the results .
From the end of 2002 the US spy agency had sources inside Iraq 's weapons plants telling them clearly what the whole world now knows -- that Saddam had ended efforts to produce weapons of mass destruction .
Nevertheless in March 2003 the United States and Britain invaded Iraq to disarm Saddam of this non-existent arsenal and in the process triggered the effective collapse of the Iraqi state , plunging it into chaos and bringing thousands of deaths .
Saad Tawfiq 's role in this drama began in June 2002 with calls from his sister Sawsan , a doctor who lives with her husband Ali in Moreland Hills , a pleasant suburb of Cleveland , Ohio , in the mid-western United States .
" Our Abu Mahmuds are putting pressure on me , " she told him , using the nickname they shared for Saad 's secret police minder as a makeshift code for the US intelligent agent who had contacted her , " Chris . "
" Chris was very nice , very polite , " Sawsan , a small energetic woman , told AFP .
Chris wanted Sawsan 's help to discover the status of Saddam 's weapons programme , and in particular his efforts to build a nuclear bomb .
She joined one of the most successful attempts by the CIA to penetrate Saddam 's Iraq , a programme dreamt up by agency veteran Charlie Allen to target Iraqi weapons technicians through their relatives .
The scientists were well known to the UN weapons inspectors who had been keeping tabs on Iraq 's arms plants since 1991 , and the Americans were able to draw up a list of 30 who had relatives in the United States .
The American relatives were to be sent to Iraq and ask about weapons .
" I was nervous , and we even discussed with Ali what to do if something happened to me , " Sawsan said .
" It was a very emotional visit back home , because I had not been there for years and I had not seen my brother for years . "
Sawsan was right to be nervous .
Saddam 's notorious secret police dealt with spies mercilessly .
She was taking a risk with her life and that of her brother , but was determined to help rid her original homeland of a tyrant .
The CIA provided her with a detailed questionnaire about Iraq 's weapons programmes .
Fearing she would forget it , Sawsan disguised it in sketches and crosswords in a kind of homemade code .
Tawfiq picked his sister up from Baghdad airport on September 9 , 2002 .
Her homecoming was emotional , but the pair had work to do .
They met secretly at night in the family garden and took walks together in the city .
The weapons engineer was astonished by the CIA 's questions , which he thought showed the depths of the agency 's ignorance about events in his country .
" I went crazy .
The questions were dumb .
She was telling me : ' They know you have a programme , ' and I was saying : ' There is nothing .
Tell them there is nothing , absolutely nothing .
They have left us with nothing ' , " Tawfiq said .
" She was taking notes .
There were 20 major questions , and to all of them the answer was : ' No , no , no ...'
I kept swearing on the grave of my mother . "
According to Tawfiq , Saddam Hussein gave the order to dismantle Iraq 's weapons of mass destruction programmes in 1995 , after his brother - in - law and arms chief Hussein Kamel defected and briefed the UN inspectors .
" I was Saddam 's scientist , " Tawfiq declared , with an ironic smile .
" In 1991 if you exposed something you were killed .
In 1995 if you hid something you were killed ! "
Sawsan dutifully gathered this information and returned to the United States to pass it on to her handlers .
But the CIA was unimpressed .
" Saad told me there was nothing left , " she told AFP .
" That everything had been either destroyed or dismantled by the UN and the regime has abandoned its nuclear programme .
And he begged me to explain all that back in the States .
" I went back and I reported what he had told me in full detail .
I even went personally to Washington .
In the beginning they listened to me but then they told me that my brother was lying , " she said .
Of course Tawfiq and other colleagues approached by the CIA were telling the truth , as the United States would discover after it had launched a bloody war that has cost tens of thousands of lives .
Paul R. Pillar , the CIA 's national intelligence officer for the Near East and South Asia at the time of the operation to question Tawfiq , said weapons scientists had not been ignored , but had been contradicted by other sources .
" To the extent that the debriefings did not have more of an effect in Washington , it probably was not because the effort came too late but instead because there were other indications that seemed to contradict what the individuals were saying , and that suggested Iraqi unconventional weapons programmes were continuing , " he told AFP .
But as Saddam 's scientist lamented five years later : " You do n't have to destroy a country for that . "
If you still can not understand why the Michigan delegates should not be seated , perhaps this will help to demonstrate the sheer idiocy and brazen bullshit of the Clinton campaign :
A few more can be found here .
It is funny because it is true .
Sally Anne Bowman was murdered in September 2005
Pub chef Mark Dixie , 37 , told friends : " Are you calling me a murderer ? " and left the country , the Old Bailey heard .
Mr Dixie denies stabbing the 18 - year - old model seven times in her driveway in Croydon , south London , during a sex attack in 2005 .
He claims he had sex with her corpse after he found her body .
The chef 's friend Victoria Chandler told the court Mr Dixie stayed at her flat a couple of streets away on the night Miss Bowman was killed .
' Why should I ?'
She left him on the sofa at 0230 BST and he was still there at 1030 BST , the court heard .
One or two weeks later , he called back to see his friend Justin Everard and the talk turned to the model 's murder , Miss Chandler told the jury .
She said : " The police was wanting males to give DNA in the area .
Justin said Mark should go and give DNA .
" Mark got quite angry , saying : ' Are you calling me a murderer ? '. "
He had added : " Why should I ? I was in the flat all night . "
Miss Chandler said he went to Amsterdam a couple of days after the conversation .
The friends had been to a local pub to celebrate Mr Dixie 's 35th birthday hours before Miss Bowman was murdered on 25 September .
Became upset
He had taken two lines of cocaine and had been drinking until closing time , said Miss Chandler .
Mr Dixie , Miss Chandler and friend Diane Glassborow returned to her flat with bottles of wine , which they drank .
Miss Glassborow told the court she saw Dixie snort another line of cocaine at the flat .
She told the court Mr Dixie had become upset when they wished him happy birthday because his girlfriend Stacey had not phoned him .
The trial continues .
In a surprising turn of events , Bluff Magazine Managing Editor Chris Vaughn aka “ BluffMagCV ” recently admitted in a face - to - face interview that he lied about his Full Tilt $ 1 Million Guaranteed win back in Novemeber .
As many internet news outlets and forums have already reported , Chris Vaughn “ sold ” his account to online poker phenom Sorel “ Imper1 um ” Mizzi while the event was nearing the final 3 tables .
After a lengthy instant messenger conversation , the two worked out a deal where Sorel would instead play out the entire tournament in exchange for a percentage of the final prize .
Unfortunately for both Vaughn and Mizzi , Full Tilt Poker was tracking IP ’s during Vaughn ’s eventual win .
The security team traced back the connection to Sorel Mizzi ’s computer , and both players were banned from Full Tilt and the $ 197 k win was confiscated from his account .
All players in the tournament got bumped up another pay level , with 2nd place finisher Soren Kongsgaard being crowned the true winner .
In an exclusive interview conducted by John Caldwell of PokerNews , both Sorel and Chris expressed regret for the decisions they made during the final stages of the tournament .
Originally , Vaughn had openly admitted he only let Mizzi play because of a bad internet connection that was causing him to miss hands and lag .
However , Vaughn set the record straight during this interview .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ The reason I sold the account had nothing to do with my connection , Ã¢â‚ ¬Â Vaughn admitted .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ The reason I initially contacted him probably more so had to do with connection , but selling the account was completely a financial decision and was in no way anything else .
Ã¢â‚¬Â 
During the sit - down with Caldwell , Chris Vaughn also admitted to lying about the incident when he was interviewed on a poker radio show with Scott Huff and Harabalous Voulgaris .
During the show , he was asked whether the accusations of “ ghosting ” were true when he played in the Full Tilt tournament .
His answer ?
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ As far as having someone take over , that Ã¢â‚¬â „ ¢s ridiculous .
Ã¢â‚¬Â
As far as where this situation goes from here is unknown .
Both players have come clean for the time being , but it is unsure whether the poker community will just forgive and forget .
This incident is one of many that have come to light as of late .
The winner of the 2007 PokerStars WCOOP Main Event also was stripped of his win and huge payday because it was discovered multi-accounting was also involved .
Bluff Magazine told 4 flush reporters “ “ Bluff Media in no way , shape , or form condones the actions of Chris Vaughn .
We were extremely unhappy , and disappointed .
However we feel that Chris has always acted in a professional manner at BLUFF in the past , and we have no plans for terminating his employment with the company .
He has been given a warning , and is on probation .
We hope that we can all move past this , and learn from it . ”
Vaughn still refuses comment .
Currency exchange outlets in Amsterdam wo n't to trade US dollars for euros because the value of the dollar is dropping so quickly they 're afraid of losing money , even with the outlandish vigorish the sleazy little joints usually tack on .
The U.S. dollar 's value is dropping so fast against the euro that small currency outlets in Amsterdam are turning away tourists seeking to sell their dollars for local money while on vacation in the Netherlands .
" Our dollar is worth maybe zero over here , " said Mary Kelly , an American tourist from Indianapolis , Indiana , in front of the Anne Frank house .
" It 's hard to find a place to exchange .
We have to go downtown , to the central station or post office . "
Hate the RIAA ?
You ’re not alone .
Lots and lots of people are n’t happy with the music industry group over the way it has handled the piracy and peer - to - peer situations that have commanded the attention of bloggers , journalists , politicians , and free - music - craving grandparents all over the globe .
Well , for those of you who wish the association ill , here ’s a little find that you might enjoy .
TorrentFreak ’s Ernesto posted a story earlier this morning about the subversion of the website owned and operated by the industry collective by way of a “ simple SQL injection , ” after which much of the information presented to visitors to the domain was erased .
According to a history of commentary on Reddit corresponding to the attack , the removal of data from the website was not performed immediately after the hole was exploited .
Rather , a large group of individuals professing anti-RIAA sentiments coalesced to bombard the site with data requests and force the host server (s ) to crash .
While that effort was underway , the apparent vulnerability in the code was exploited .
The end result is a muzzled domain that now fails to oblige requests for information .
( Such was still the case at 12:23 PM EST today . )
Does that put a smile on your face ?

Illinois state Rep. Monique Davis ’ heated public exchange last Wednesday with atheist activist Rob Sherman over the allocation of $ 1 million in state funds to repair a church is still going on — fortunately for Sherman , perhaps not so much for Davis — on the Internet , at least .
The Chicago Tribune via BoingBoing :
Davis : I do n’t know what you have against God , but some of us do n’t have much against him .
We look forward to him and his blessings .
And it ’s really a tragedy — it ’s tragic — when a person who is engaged in anything related to God , they want to fight .
They want to fight prayer in school .
I do n’t see you ( Sherman ) fighting guns in school .
You know ?
I ’m trying to understand the philosophy that you want to spread in the state of Illinois .
This is the Land of Lincoln .
This is the Land of Lincoln where people believe in God , where people believe in protecting their children … .
What you have to spew and spread is extremely dangerous , it ’s dangerous –
Sherman :
What ’s dangerous , ma’am ?
Davis :
It ’s dangerous to the progression of this state .
And it ’s dangerous for our children to even know that your philosophy exists !
Now you will go to court to fight kids to have the opportunity to be quiet for a minute .
But damn if you ’ll go to [ court ] to fight for them to keep guns out of their hands .
I am fed up !
Get out of that seat !

Former Congressman Bob Barr is now talking seriously about running for the Libertarian Party ’s Presidential nomination :
On an Internet site called Anti-War Radio , former Georgia congressman Bob Barr confirmed on Wednesday that he ’s “ very seriously ” looking at joining the race for the White House as a Libertarian — and had harsh words for both the Iraq war and for the Bush Administration ’s defense of “ enhanced interrogation techniques . ”
(…)
On a presidential run , Barr said :
“ There ’s been a tremendous expressed to me both directly and indirectly on the Internet .
I take that support very seriously , and I think it also reflects a great deal of dissatisfaction with the current candidates and the current two - party system .
So it is something , to be honest with you , that I ’m looking very seriously at . ”
Barr said a Libertarian candidacy would essentially be an extension of the Ron Paul campaign .
“ Ron Paul tapped into a great deal of that dissatisfaction and that awareness .
Unfortunately , working through the Republican party structure , it became impossible for him to really move forward with his movement .
But we have to have …. a rallying point out there to harness that energy , that freedom in this election cycle , ” Barr said .
On Iraq :
“ What we ’ve fallen into in recent years — not just since 9/11 , but particularly since 9/11 — is this notion that , in order to protect ourselves , we have to preemptively go into and — in the case of Iraq — occupy another sovereign nation , ” Barr said .
“ Simply saying , ‘ Gee , it ’s better to fight over in this other nation and destroy another nation , so we ’re not potentially attacked here , is the height of arrogance . ”
As for the Bush administration ’s refusal to define waterboarding as torture , Barr referred to the practice as “ sophistry of the worst and rankest order . ”
Denver Foreclosures
Although Alan Greenspan may be looking for a bottom in housing soon , the folks in Denver , Colorado are not so lucky : USA Today has a surprisingly ugly Google mashup of the foreclosures in a neighborhood in Denver .
Lenders foreclosed on about 7,700 homes in Denver last year ; officials expect 11,000 this year , mirroring a national increase .
Among the neighborhoods hardest hit was this corner of the Green Valley Ranch subdivision .
The map shows foreclosures since late 2006 in Red

Imagine if we'd have spent all that wasted capital on stem cell research , invested it in training , education - birth control ?

A control - system station screen at Olympic Pipeline the day of a deadly 1999 pipeline break .
Image : NTSBOn June 10th , 1999 a 16 - inch diameter steel pipeline operated by the now - defunct Olympic Pipeline Co. ruptured near Bellingham , Washington , flooding two local creeks with 237,000 gallons of gasoline .
The gas ignited into a mile - and - a - half river of fire that claimed the lives of two 10 - year - old boys and an 18 - year - old man , and injured eight others .
Wednesday , computer - security experts who recently re-examined the Bellingham incident called its victims the first verified human causalities of a control - system computer incident .
They argue that government cybersecurity standards currently under debate might have prevented the tragedy .
" I 've logged over 90 incidents in all industries worldwide , " said Joe Weiss , managing partner at Applied Control Solutions , speaking at the RSA Conference in San Francisco .
" The damage ranges from significant equipment failure to deaths . "
Following the 1999 incident , a nearly three - year investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board concluded that multiple causes contributed to the deadly conflagration , including pipeline damage inflicted by construction workers years earlier , and a misconfigured valve .
But the factor that intrigues Weiss and fellow researcher Marshall Abrams , a scientist at MITRE , is a still largely unexplained computer failure that began less than 30 minutes before the accident and paralyzed the central control room operating the pipeline , preventing workers from releasing pressure in the line before it hemorrhaged .
With support from the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology , Weiss and Abrams pored over public government records on the incident , looking at it through the lens of a pending cybersecurity standard called NIST 800 - 53 .
The duo concluded that the requirements in the standard would have prevented the explosion from occurring .
" The NTSB concluded that if the SCADA system computers had remained responsive to the commands of the Olympic controllers , the controller operating the pipeline probably would have been able to initiate actions that would have prevented the pressure increase that ruptured the pipeline , " reads the NIST report .
" These are the first fatalities from a control - system cyberevent that I can document , and for a fact say that this really occurred , " Weiss said in an earlier interview with Wired.com .
Security experts and government investigators have long warned that the complex networks controlling critical infrastructures like the power grid , and gas and oil pipelines , were not built with security in mind – a point driven home by several incidents of the systems failing .
In January 2003 , the Slammer worm penetrated a private computer network at Ohio's Davis - Besse nuclear power plant and disabled a safety - monitoring system for nearly five hours .
Later that year , a software bug in a General Electric energy - management system contributed to a cascading power failure that cut off electricity to 50 million people in eight states and a Canadian province .
Piecing together the computer failure at Olympic is difficult .
A system administrator , two control room operators and their supervisor all refused to testify in the resulting investigation , citing their Fifth Amendment right against self - incrimination .
Several key system logs from the VAX VMS minicomputer from the time of the accident were missing or deleted , for reasons that have never been determined .
But the NTSB 's original report faulted an unnamed computer operator for adding records to a database that was running on the pipeline monitoring system .
The board also noted that the overall system had security design defects , since it had connections to the larger company network that was itself internet connected and had dial - up lines .
The board found no evidence of a computer attack from the outside , though .
But Weiss , an outspoken evangelist for tighter control - system security standards , said he 's suspicious of the NTSB 's finding that the computer operator was at fault .
" The NTSB said he was doing database updates on the live system , " Weiss said Wednesday .
" What did he do on this day that he did n't do everyday ? "
Abrams seems less convinced , suggesting the explosion was " probably " a combination of human error and a badly designed computer system , with a dose of bad luck thrown in for good measure .
Regardless , Abrams said the point is the same , and the casualties at Bellingham still count as victims of a cyber- incident .
" Control systems are just a special case of information technology , " he said Wednesday .
The NIST 800 - 53 standard , which is due to be issued this year , will only be binding on federal agencies , but might be voluntarily adopted by critical infrastructure providers in the private sector .
Included in the standard are immutable audit logs , individualized passwords , and user accounts that have only the permissions the person needs .
Bellingham had none of those precautions in 1999 .
Weiss said little has changed in the industry since then
" Until eight years ago , my whole life was making control systems usable and efficient , and , by the way , very vulnerable , " Weiss said .
" It is exactly what you will find today in many , many industrial applications .
This is n't just 1999 .
No , this is June 2008 . "

The first thing I want to say is that there is no Al Qaeda ; not in the way we understand it to be .
The only Al Qaeda ever found is this one here and given the fact that there are now more Al Qaeda outlets than there are McDonald ’s makes it all the more absurd .
On Friday , unknown gunman attacked the Israeli Embassy in Mauritania and once again it was Al Qaeda .
A bystander said the colors were melting from the flag flying from the getaway car .
Al Qaeda means The Toilet ... think a little people and add this in to what we know about 9/11 .
Over the last several days four underground cables have been cut in the Middle East .
You can read about it here .
One was also cut that linked UAE and Oman so this gives us four cables .
Guess what ?
Ships dragging anchors caused this in every case .
At no time in the past did four major cables get cut at the same relative time by dragging ship ’s anchors and now four have been cut just like that .
Can you say “ three high rise buildings tumbling into their own footprints in one day ? ” I thought you could .
Iran has virtually ( pun intended ) no internet at the moment and there are many countries whose internet and telephone are seriously disrupted .
See anything about this in the whore press ?
Nada ...
It may or may not matter who wins the White House - out of the likely suspects - this November but you can be sure that many an ugly will bump in the night of this endless year because it ’s just easier with the present set of blood - stained clowns .
That ’s right , the United States and the world are a legion of frightened Boy Scouts running from a fifty foot John Wayne Gacy .
He ’s got a set of handcuffs in one hand and a massive rotating sexual device in the other and he sounds like Mick Jagger saying “ Peace brother ’s and sisters . ” during the mob pandemonium at Altamont while he beats the stage with his studded leather belt and launches back into Midnight Rambler on top of the pentagram painted on the stage .
Does anyone want to tell me how an organization being controlled from some non-existent Pakistani mountain fastness can be in contact with it ’s satellite outlets in every country of the world and recruit faster than the Mormon ’s and Scientologists put together ?
Sometimes it seems to me that if there were just more common sense going around most of this bullshit would be the fodder of comics and no one would take it seriously .
The fact is that common sense is n’t very common .
You throw in a little fear ; you season it with suspicion and the threat of want and loss and you ’ve got a dish that can turn a pretty green planet into a dark blue nightmare at a moment ’s notice .
There ’s no Al Qaeda except maybe for people who support the idea of an Al Qaeda which got cooked up in the CIA media labs and then given more international airplay than Bob Marley .
Bin Laden is dead and gone and you have to be bone deep stupid not to know by now .
Why the hell would they need to fabricate all of those video tapes if the real thing was still running around loose ?
Then you have to ask why the first thing the administration did after 9/11 was to spirit all of his relatives out of town .
Now we ’ve got the Sibel Edmonds report and the news about Philip Zelikow and it ’s as clear as clear can be that everything we see and hear is being manipulated to bring into being a world that no one wants to live in except neo-cons and Al Qaeda ; who does n’t exist .
We know that boat anchors did n’t cut those cables .
We know that one boat anchor might have cut one cable someday , somewhere and that it might have cut two cables right next to each other but it damn sure did n’t cut four cables in all those different locations .
So why did ‘ they ’ do it ?
You might as well ask why Israel wo n’t tell the people cleaning up the cluster bombs in Lebanon where they dropped those bombs at no matter how many times they are asked .
You might as well ask why torture people who could n’t know the answers to your questions since you are the ones who did the things you are torturing them for the information about .
You might as well as ask yourself why you go along with all of this .
You wo n’t get any answers and if you do you wo n’t like them .
I do n’t know what it ’s going to take to wake people up but if it ’s even possible to happen you are going to see it this year .
Mikhael Aivanhov was a great disciple of Peter Dunov from Bulgaria .
He lived most of his life in the south of France and some of that during the Nazi regime .
He once said , “ When God comes to wake you up , he first gently shakes you on the shoulder .
If you do not awaken he shakes you harder .
If you still do not awaken , he picks up a two - by - four . ”
These times are just about your two - by - four .
It should be crystal clear to anyone with even a borderline intellect that those chosen to serve us and those who usurped the process by which we pick those who serve us , are the biggest enemies we have .
I get all kinds of bullshit letters from people who tell me there ’s nothing we can do ; who tell me that my distaste at what is happening is part of the problem , that really wise minds like theirs have the proper dispassion to see that this is all just a mental projection and everything ’s okay .
I ’m glad that your pristine sense of detachment allows you this unique perspective .
One of the things I like about Ron Paul supporters is that they know lies when they see them .
They are from every political persuasion and every walk of life and they all have some idea that things are not what they should be .
Let me say it again ; there is no Al Qaeda , Bin Laden is dead and besides he was a CIA asset , 9/11 was an Inside Job and no boat anchors cut those cables .
The same swine coalition of bankers and politicians and military and corporate interests are behind every bit of this with the drag queens of the established church throwing flowers in their wake .
Did you really imagine that they were through yet ?
Did you think those swaggering bullies at the airport check in with the rubber gloves dangling from their belts were Buddha ’s in disguise ?
Did you not wonder why you could n’t wear your t- shirts anymore and why every single thing you say is now suspect if someone wants to suspect you ?
Did you not wonder at Blackwater and all of the incremental international and local injustices taking place every day ?
Do you not wonder why every member of congress is a concubine with their face pressed into a pillow and their ass raised into the air ?
Did you not wonder at the marks on Bush ’s face ?
What ’s it going to take people for you to realize that they are not done at all yet ?
I know a lot of you have watched action movies and thrillers and you always imagined that you were the bronzed model doing all the tumbling and rolling and firing from the hip .
I hope you ’re in shape because they ’re about to call you on to the set .
It ’s a little different being a hero when they drag you out of line and it ’s not a movie anymore .

THE Indonesian Health Minister has said the United States and the World Health Organisation are part of a global conspiracy to profit from the spread of bird flu and the US may use samples to produce biological weapons .
The views of Dr Siti Fadilah Supari , outlined in her new book , threaten to undermine efforts to control the spread of avian influenza .
With 104 deaths , nearly half the world total , Indonesia is the new hotspot for the virus .
Despite claims by the minister that she has agreed to share virus samples and allow all nations access to resulting vaccines , Indonesia is still blocking sharing samples from human victims .
It may not be beautiful or stylish , but it is the most complicated pocket watch ever .
Made in 1989 for the 150th anniversary of Patek Phillippe , The Calibre 89 has 1789 components .
I wanted you to see it because I found it to be a rare and interesting sight .
Being so complicated and so special , Patek Philippe created only four pieces of the precious pocket watch .
The four are somehow different , being made from platinum , white gold , rose gold and yellow gold developed in 5 years and manufactured in 4 others .
The most complicated watch in the world features no more than 33 functions .
Imagine your watch having a century , decade and year display , a leap year indicator , a thermometer , date of Easter indicator , a Star chart ( with 2,800 stars ) and showing the time of sunrise and sundown !
Luckily ( for me ) it costs around $ 6 millions !
Otherwise I would have challenged myself to go out and buy it and spend few weeks trying to figure it out !
And it ’s not only outrageously expensive , it ’s also excessively heavy !
– it weights almost 3lbs !
So it ’s not enough that I carry a bag stuffed with toys , diapers , and so on and so on anyway , I would have added the heaviest watch too !
On a recently concluded call with reporters , Susan Rice was pushing back vigorously on the Clinton campaign 's assertions that she trumps Obama in the national security experience department .
Her strong points where when she pointed out that Clinton 's claims of experience often seem overblown .
Rice referenced the fact that Clinton 's surrogates could n't site any examples of her crisis - management experience , said that Clinton " claims to have negotiated opening the border of Macedonia , but that opening preceeded the opening of that visit by a day , " and said that Clinton 's " claimed to have played a crucial independent role in the Northern Ireland negotiations , but George MItchell said she was ' not involved directly . ' "
I think that 's all about right .
Rice and the rest of Team Obama is quite a bit less convincing when they try to talk up their own candidate 's experience in these domains .
They wind up winning this argument since they 're not the ones who 've been trying to fight the campaign on this issue , but the reality is that like most presidents either Clinton or Obama would be entering office without significant diplomatic or military experience even though these are the most important aspects of the job .
I 'll take " little experience plus good ideas " over " years of experience have committed me to crazy warmongering " in a heartbeat , but that 's the basic shape of things .
There were some more interesting ideas put forth on the call on more interesting topics -- including ideas aimed squarely at John McCain -- but it'll probably take me until tomorrow to get my thoughts together on them .
We want to hear what you think about this article .

Mayor Bloomberg charged yesterday that “ fraud ” was behind the unofficial results in the New York Democratic presidential primary that produced zero votes for Barack Obama in some districts .
“ If you want to call it significant undercounting , I guess that ’s a euphemism for fraud , ” said the mayor .
Unofficial tallies on election night gave Obama no votes in 78 out of more than 6,000 election districts .
Saul Bass is the master of film title design .
Here ’s his opening title sequence for “ The Man With The Golden Arm . ”
The backstory :
When the reels of film for Otto Preminger ’s controversial new drugs movie , The Man with the Golden Arm , arrived at US movie theatres in 1955 , a note was stuck on the cans – “ Projectionists – pull curtain before titles ” .
Until then , the lists of cast and crew members which passed for movie titles were so dull that projectionists only pulled back the curtains to reveal the screen once they ’d finished .
But Preminger wanted his audience to see The Man with the Golden Arm ’s titles as an integral part of the film .
The movie ’s theme was the struggle of its hero – a jazz musician played by Frank Sinatra – to overcome his heroin addiction .
Designed by the graphic designer Saul Bass the titles featured an animated black paper - cut - out of a heroin addict ’s arm .
Knowing that the arm was a powerful image of addiction , Bass had chosen it – rather than Frank Sinatra ’s famous face – as the symbol of both the movie ’s titles and its promotional poster .
That cut - out arm caused a sensation and Saul Bass reinvented the movie title as an art form .
By the end of his life , he had created over 50 title sequences for Preminger , Alfred Hitchcock , Stanley Kubrick , John Frankenheimer and Martin Scorsese .

BBC News , Baghdad
The violence has fallen , but anti-US forces remain
Ryan Crocker 's warning comes as Democratic candidates in the US presidential race talk of setting timetables for pulling out troops .
The ambassador told the BBC a recent improvement in the current security situation was not irreversible .
He warned a new cycle of violence could start up if withdrawals were not handled very carefully .
For all the progress that has been achieved over the past year there are still a strong sectarian tensions ...
There is still an al - Qaeda presence , there is still foreign interference particularly from Iran
Ryan Crocker
Text of full interview
Democratic contender Barack Obama has said he favours a full withdrawal by the end of next year , while Hillary Clinton says she will set a timetable within two months if she is elected .
Ambassador Crocker did not comment directly on the candidates and their views , but he stressed his own long - standing conviction that future withdrawals should depend on conditions on the ground - not on timetables set in Washington .
Tensions
To remove that consideration , he said , would be to take an unacceptable risk .
" For all the progress that has been achieved over the past year there are still a strong sectarian tensions , " Mr Crocker said .
Mr Crocker became the ambassador in Baghdad in March 2007
" There is still an al - Qaeda presence , there is still foreign interference particularly from Iran .
" Now all of these things can spark a new cycle of instability and violence if we 're not very very careful and closely linked with the Iraqis on what the next step should be . "
The current American troop surge is to be finished by July .
After that , US military commanders and Mr Crocker advocate a pause for assessment before reducing troop numbers below the pre-surge levels of around 130,000 .
The ambassador said Iran was continuing to support extremist militias in Iraq despite official support for the Iraqi government .
He hoped the visit by the Iranian President , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , in early March would prompt Iran to bring its practices into line with its policies .
NEW YORK ( Reuters Life ! ) - Steve Nichols , a middle manager at a technology company in Ohio , gets home late from work and spends most evenings sending work - related e-mails .

Like many other Americans he is working more and sleeping less which could have an impact on their professional and personal lives .
A new survey by the National Sleep Foundation shows people are spending an average of 4.5 hours each week doing additional work from home , on top of a 9.5 hour average work day .
While 28 percent of people questioned in the survey said their daytime sleepiness interferes with their daily activities at least a few days a month , 63 percent said they are likely to accept their sleepiness and keep going .
“ There ’s enough data now to clearly show that if you ’re not sleeping enough , that ’s going to dramatically affect your performance and productivity , ” said Mark Rosekind , a former director of the Center for Human Sleep Research at the Stanford University Sleep Center who helped design the poll .
“ People think if I can jam more hours in the day I ’ll get more done .
That ’s not true , ” he added in an interview .
Although Nichols , 35 , said he has n’t noticed any negative effects , his wife says he looks beat up and run down .
The only time he catches up on his sleep is when he takes a vacation where his BlackBerry does n’t work .
“ That removes the temptation , ” he said .
Nearly one third of the 1,000 people who took part in the telephone poll late last year said they fell asleep or were tired on the job in the past month , and 12 percent reported being late to work .
Rosekind said estimates of what an overtired workforce costs the economy have put it at between $ 50 and $ 130 billion each year due to lost job productivity , accidents , injuries and medical conditions .
He added that most people will rate themselves as being wide awake and performing at a good level but “ when you measure them they ’re horrible . ”
The poll also showed that lack of sleep is affecting people ’s safety .
Nearly 40 percent of people report nodding off or falling asleep while driving and 14 percent missed family events , work functions and leisure activities .
Almost one in four of those questioned admitted doing job - related work in the hour before going to bed at least a few nights each week , so it ’s no surprise that 20 percent are having less sex because they are too tired .
Victoria Castillo would like to be able to turn her brain off from work .
The 33 - year - old artist spends between 60 - 70 hours each week in her home - based studio in College Station , Texas , and like almost one in five of those surveyed , uses an over - the - counter sleep aid at least a few nights each week .
“ It does take a physical toll and a mental toll and a toll on my work when I can’t sleep .
They do feed each other .
If I could change one thing in my life it would be to be able to sleep , ” she said .
When it comes to emotions , Eastern and Western cultures assess situations very differently , says a new research .
The research , conducted by scientists from Canada and Japan , was based on two studies in which participants viewed images , each of which consisted of one centre model and four background models in each image .
The researchers manipulated the facial emotion , happy , angry , sad , in the centre or background models and asked the participants to determine the dominant emotion of the centre figure .
72 percent of the Japanese participants reported that their judgments of the centre person 's emotions were influenced by the emotions of the background figures , while most North Americans , also 72 , reported that they were not influenced by the background figures at all .
" What we found is quite interesting .
Our results demonstrate that when North Americans are trying to figure out how a person is feeling , they selectively focus on that particular person 's facial expression , whereas Japanese consider the emotions of the other people in the situation , " said Takahiko Masuda , a Psychology professor from the University of Alberta .
This may be because Japanese attention is not concentrated on the individual , but includes everyone in the group , said Masuda .
For the second part of the study , researchers monitored the eye movements of the participants and again the results indicated that the Japanese looked at the surrounding people more than the westerners when judging the situation .
While both the Japanese and westerners looked to the central figure during the first second of viewing the photo , the Japanese looked to the background figures at the very next second , while westerners continued to focus on the central figure .
" East Asians seem to have a more holistic pattern of attention , perceiving people in terms of the relationships to others .
People raised in the North American tradition often find it easy to isolate a person from its surroundings , while East Asians are accustom to read the air ' kuuki wo yomu ' of the situation through their cultural practices , and as a result , they think that even surrounding people 's facial expressions are an informative source to understand the particular person 's emotion , " said Masuda .
The study is published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology .

I ’ve had many readers and new bloggers e-mail me for tips on starting a blog .
I love answering e-mails and helping people , but I often found myself answering many of the questions multiple times .
So I thought writing a series on how to start a blog would be a more effective method of helping people realize their goal of starting their own blog .
This “ how to start a blog ” series is intended to help you decide if blogging is for you , and if it is , how to set up a blog and get it going .
There are thousands of other topics that can be covered outside the scope of this series , but I will leave it to the hundreds of blogger that blog about blogging , getting traffic , making money and similar topics .
At the end of the series I will link out to several other resources that will help you on your journey of improving your blog once you get it going .
What is a Blog ?
Blogs , or weblogs , originally started out as a way to share links and stories with others on the web .
As time and technology evolved , so did blogging .
Now blogging is something that anyone can do – from a teenager , to a CEO from a Fortune 500 company , to your grandmother who may have only recently learned how to use the internet .
Blogs can be set up for free within minutes or you can buy a domain and hosting and spend hundreds of dollars on customization , advertising , and other miscellaneous expenses .
The quick answer is – a blog is what you want it to be – there are no rules except those that you set for your blog .
Why start a blog ?
Blogging can be a great creative outlet that you share only with friends and family , it can be your full - time job , or it can be anything in between .
The internet is the cheapest and most accessible way to communicate quickly and easily with a large amount of people .
The internet also keeps a permanent record of what you post , which can be a nice way for friends and family members to keep up to date , or for businesses to share their product or services with the world .
There are many benefits to and reasons for starting a weblog :
Informational : sharing news , information , photos , videos
sharing news , information , photos , videos Professional : enhancing your business , as a career journal , to display your writing skills , market yourself or your business
enhancing your business , as a career journal , to display your writing skills , market yourself or your business Personal : personal or family blog , thoughts and musings , as a family photo or video journal
personal or family blog , thoughts and musings , as a family photo or video journal As a business : internet marketing , consulting , brand development
This list is by no means comprehensive and there can be overlap between the categories .
The uses of a blog are limited only by your imagination .
Who Should Start a Blog ?
The beauty of blogging is that it is incredibly easy to do – anyone who can surf the internet or use a word processor can start a blog .
But that does n’t mean everyone should start a blog .
Ask yourself these questions :
Do you enjoy writing ?
Are you passionate about a certain topic ?
Do you have specialized knowledge you want to share ?
Do you want to enhance or grow your business ?
Do you want to create an online journal to share with family and friends ?
What about a career journal ?
Do you have a portfolio of photographs , artwork , or web designs you want to market ?
Do you want to earn money ?
These questions are just the tip of the iceberg , but they are a good place to start .
If you answered yes to any or all of these questions , you may want to consider starting a blog .
Note that I added “ earn money ” last on the list .
While some blogs are profitable and there are some professional bloggers , blogging can be hard work and it is not a get rich quick scheme .
What to Write About – Why You Should Consider Your Purpose Before Starting a Blog
So you after reading the introduction on starting a blog for fun or profit you have decided you want to go for it and start your own blog .
Great !
But what should you write about ?
This is one of the most important questions you will face when deciding to start a blog .
You want to write about a topic in which you are knowledgeable , and more importantly , that you are passionate about .
But before we go further , you need to ask another important question to help you define your blog .
What is your blog ’s purpose ?
Before putting pen to paper , you need to ask yourself what the purpose of your blog will be .
We asked similar questions in the first part of the series , and you may have already answered this question .
Once you know your blog ’s purpose , you need to narrow your focus until you can answer this question with a one sentence answer .
There is no right or wrong answer – your blog is what you want it to be .
You will need more than just a purpose , you will also need knowledge and passion .
Two key elements of blogging : Knowledge and Passion
Without knowledge and passion , your blog is doomed to fail .
These two elements feed off each other and it will give you the energy you need to continue writing , even when you hit a down period and do n’t feel as though you have anything to contribute .
The knowledge test .
Let ’s try a quick test – grab a sheet of paper and and start writing down article ideas ; a title or rough sentence is all you need .
If you ca n’t come up with 30 article ideas in about 5 minutes , it might be best to think about a different topic .
The passion test .
Ask yourself a few questions about your topic idea –
Do you think about this topic every day ?
multiple times per day ?
Can you talk about it for hours ?
Do you actively search out new information on your topic or actively bring it up in conversations ?
All of these answers should be yes .
How many topics should you write about ?
Give your blog one main theme .
People will usually expect to read related topics on the same site , so it is usually best to focus on one topic or a set of related topics .
On Cash Money Life I focus on “ personal finance and career ” topics .
These are n’t the same topic , but they are related closely enough that it makes sense to combine the topics .
It would n’t make sense for me to write about personal finance today , then fishing tomorrow , then ballroom dancing on Friday , then … catch my point ?
It will be infinitely easier to grow you blog in terms of subscribers and traffic if readers know what to expect .
But I pass the knowledge and passion test on multiple topics !
So you are a Renaissance man , eh ?
Schooled in math , science , engineering , economics , politics , art , music , and travel ?
Why not write about all of these topics and place them all on the same site ?
Because readers wo n’t know what to expect on any given day – which will turn off many people .
If you want to write about all these topics you have two choices to consider – creating separate sites for each topic , or use a subdomain for each additional topic .
An example of a subdomain : I enjoy finding deals , ways to save money , and ways to make free money , but I could n’t fit them all in on Cash Money Life without adding a lot of extra posts .
That would eventually dilute the personal finance articles I write so I added a subdomain to take care of this .
Using multiple subdomains :
You are n’t limited to just one subdomain .
You can make as many as you want .
Check out Curious Cat and how he uses subdomains to cover 3 diverse topics .
If you notice , each of these “ sites ” has a different feel to let the reader know the topic has changed .
By doing using subdomains , he is able to maintain his site ’s brand while branching out into the topics that interest him .
And he does this without confusing his readers .
So which topic should you write about ?
Only you can answer that question .
My advice is to brainstorm , take the passion and knowledge tests , then start off with the topic that interest you the most .
It may be tempting to try and start 5 blogs at once because you have the passion for those topics , but you will be more successful if you focus on one blog to begin with .
The learning curve and time commitment are much larger than most people realize .
Should You Have a Hosted or Self - Hosted Website ?
Now we will discuss different types of blog hosting – an important consideration that must be made before starting your blog .
This determines where you website is hosted – either on your own domain , or on a free blogging platform .
There are pros and cons to both , which we will cover .
Ultimately , the decision is yours .
Hosted vs. Self - Hosted Blogs
There are two main types of blogging services you will need to consider : Hosted or self - hosted .
With a self - hosted blog you will typically purchase a domain and a web hosting package , set up the blogging software , and take care of all the details yourself .
With a hosted blog , all you do is sign up for an account , select a blog name and start blogging .
The company hosting your blog takes care of ( most of ) the other details .
While this sounds nice , there are usually a lot of limitations that come with hosted blogs .
As with everything there are pros and cons .
Be sure to understand what you are getting into before you commit to either blog hosting choice .
Pros and Cons of Hosted Blogs
Advantages of using a hosted blog service .
There are many advantages to using a hosted blog service , chief among them is price .
Many hosted blog services are free .
The most common examples of free blogging services are Blogger and WordPress.com .
Another popular hosted blogging platform is TypePad.com , which is a subscription blog service geared more toward people and businesses who do not want to mess around with the technical side of blogging .
For most of these services , you simply set up an account and start writing .
It ’s that easy !
Disadvantages of using a hosted blog service .
The biggest disadvantage is limited flexibility and control .
Some blog services have a limited number of available themes ( The “ skin ” that gives blogs their unique look ) , some do not allow advertising , and some do not have an easy way to back up your data .
Ownership is another issue .
While you own the content you have written , you do not own the domain – such as “ mybloggerwebsite.blogspot ” – and you will not be able to sell your site should you want to .
Lastly , should the host cease to operate or randomly delete your blog ( this has happened to many people ) , you are out of luck .
To sum up , you are at the mercy of your blog ’s provider .
Other notes regarding hosted blogs : WordPress.com is free but does not allow advertisements .
TypePad.com requires users to pay a monthly or annual usage fee ( however , this may be the perfect solution for your business ) .
Who should you hosted blogging ?
Hosted blogging is a great solution for people who are looking for a free or inexpensive blogging solution and do n’t want to hassle with many of the technical details of blogging .
However , they should be aware that there may be certain limitations regarding the design of their blog , the ability to earn money with their blog , or the ability to sell it in the future .
The Pros and Cons of Self - Hosted Blogging
Cash Money
Life is a self - hosted blog and is what I recommend for anyone who is serious about building a website with staying power and earning potential .
Advantages of using a self - hosted blog .
Control .
You control everything .
While this might seem daunting at first , this is actually a blessing .
With full control of your website , you can change the look or feel of your site whenever you want .
You can place advertisements , back up your data , export data , run analysis , or even sell your blog .
You own the domain and all the content within it .
Disadvantages of using a self - hosted blog .
Control .
A blessing can also be a disadvantage .
When you run a self - hosted blog , there is a learning curve involved .
Thankfully , most of the software is very easy to use , much of it is free , and there are hundreds of free resources available if you know where to look ( more details on that in a future article ) .
The other disadvantage is cost .
You will need to buy a domain and a web hosting package to host your domain .
Fortunately , the cost is not prohibitive .
You can get started for under $ 100 , including the domain and your first year of web hosting service .
Just look for Go Daddy coupon codes when you register your domain and use an inexpensive and reliable web host like LunarPages .
LunarPages also gives customers a free domain with the purchase of a year ’s hosting plan , so you may be able to skip using a registrar like GoDaddy .
Who should use a self - hosted blog ?
I recommend using a self - hosted blog for anyone who plans on making a serious attempt at blogging , has plans on making money with their website , wants total control of their website , or wants the option of selling their website in the future .
Should You Choose a Hosted or Self - Hosted Blog Plan ?
The choice , of course , is up to you and you should get the blog setup that best meets your needs .
If you only plan on sharing your blog with close friends and family , then a free hosted blog plan like Blogger or WordPress.com is probably sufficient .
TypePad would be a good solution for a business that wanted an inexpensive hosting solution but did n’t want to take care of many of the technical aspects of the blog .
But if you have plans on starting a blog that will be highly trafficked and will hopefully make money , then I strongly recommend purchasing your own domain and web hosting package .
For less than $ 100 you will have 100 % flexibility and save yourself a lot of headaches down the road .
How to Choose a Domain Name
Now you need to choose a domain name .
Your domain will be with your site forever and it is a very important factor in the success of your blog .
These tips should help you find the perfect domain name for your new blog .
How to choose a good domain name
Your domain is your website ’s calling card – it will be one of the first things people recognize and it will be with you for the life of your blog .
The difference between a good domain and a poor domain can mean many more repeat visitors .
That is why it is so important to get it right the first time !
Qualities of a good domain
A good domain is something that will be relatively short , easy to remember , and more importantly , easy to type .
Branding is another factor to consider – popular sites such as Google and Twitter are made up words .
If you do this well , you might be on to something .
If not , you might find your domain in the next section – poor domain names .
Qualities of a poor domain .
A poor domain may be hard to remember , have complicated words or spellings , be confusing , and may use excessive numbers or dashes in the name .
Be careful when using a made up word ; while Google and Twitter were mentioned as good examples of made up words that succeeded as brands , there have been thousands of made up words that died a slow , lonely death from lack of visitors .
. Com , .net , .org …
What ’s the difference ?
In the hierarchy of the web , .com extensions are the most common and most favored , followed by .org , .net , other country codes ( .co.uk , .ca , etc. ) then other extensions .
Always try for the .com first , then if it is not available , try for the .org , or .net .
Try to avoid the .info extension , as many of these are used by spammy websites and infomarketers .
Where and how to purchase a domain
I have purchased my domains from a variety of sources , including GoDaddy , Google , Name Cheap , and Register.com .
Another option for registering domains is through your webshost .
However , many people prefer to keep their domains separate from their host , for various reasons .
GoDaddy and Register.com also offer hosting packages , which you will need to get your site up and running .
Brainstorm and try different options .
When you visit GoDaddy you will see a box to input your desired domain name .
Enter it and click the submit button and GoDaddy will check your desired name against all registered domains .
You may find your first choice is taken – if so , keep trying variations or other domains until you find what you are looking for .
When you find your desired domain name , go to the checkout , and do n’t forget to use your GoDaddy promo code before you purchase it !
How to Make Money with Your Blog
What about money ?
Ah , you noticed I did n’t bring up money yet !
That ’s because money should n’t factor into why you want to start a blog .
If you have the knowledge and the passion , it will show and you will eventually get readers and traffic .
And with those two elements , you can start thinking about making money with your blog .
Not all websites make money , nor should every website make money .
But it is no secret that some websites make money and the potential is there .
I started this website in 2007 .
By 2010 , I was running websites as my full - time job .
But that does n’t mean it was easy or that I did n’t have a lot of lucky breaks along the way .
It took a lot of late nights and hard work , and in many ways , I was in the right place at the right time .
Ways to Make Money with Your Website
AdSense .
No doubt you are familiar with this one .
The AdSense locations on your site are good , however , I noticed that the large leaderboard in the header section on your hiome page is partially covered , which is against the AdSense TOS .
This could get you a nastygram from Google , or even booted from the program .
A 468x 80 ad should fit there perfectly and might even look better , leading to more clicks .
Affiliate ads .
This is where I am trying to concentrate now because this is where the most opportunity lies .
Since your site often deals with stocks , affiliates for online discount brokers such as TradeKing , ShareBuilder , and Zecco would be ideal products to link to .
There are several companies I recommend for affiliates , including Commission Junction , Pepperjam Network ( there is currently a $ 10 bonus for new publishers ) , LinkShare , LinkConnector , and ShareASale .
Once you sign up for any of these companies , you search their advertiser inventory , apply for a program , get approved , and place affiliate links in your articles , on the sidebars , or anywhere else you think might bring traffic .
You make money when someone buys something from your link .
TradeKing has affiliates with Pepperjam and Commision Junction , ShareBuilder is with LinkShare , and Zecco is Commission Junction .
It helps to sign up for multiple affiliate companies .
Display Ads ( Banner Ads ) / CPM ) Ads. CPM means “ cost per mille ” or cost per thousand .
They pay out on a cost per thousand page views .
Many publishers use a 3rd party tool Like Google DoubleClick for Publishers to manage ads from multiple ad agencies , since agencies do n’t always fill every impression .
The other agencies act as backup ads .
The payouts vary , usually anywhere from $ 1 - 3 per thousand page views .
I do n’t look at CPM ads as a way to make a lot of money , but they can be a nice source of income to augment your other income .
Text Link Ads .
Google does n’t like these because the can wreak havoc on their page rank algorithm , so use at your own risk .
I have used Text - link - Ads and Linkworth in the past , as well as sold private text link ads .
I no longer sell text links , but some people still sell them .
Direct ad sales .
I do n’t get many of these , but they come on occasion .
I have sold banner ads and text links .
I do n’t currently sell text links any more , though they can be extremely lucrative .
Use online tools to help you build upon growth
Using online tools such as Google Analytics is just one way to track your traffic statistics .
Once you get your site up and running , you will notice that certain articles are bringing in more traffic than others .
A good way to increase your traffic more quickly is to leverage your growth by increasing your content by writing on similar topics .
Loosing a brother
Is really hard , we asked Rita to write her story to be published in our blogs , and I told her I ’ll contact the journalists I know to publish her story , her voice should be heard , and Raffi ’s memory should be remembered always ..
Raffi , you was and will always be a model for me , and many others , I want you to know , you ’ll always be in our hearts , and people will remember you as the kindest person ever , your smile , your behavior , and everything in your personality is unique , I feel honored to type what Rita wrote about you , I feel sorry because we will miss you , but in the same time I know you are in heaven , may your soul rest in peace , …
Now , I leave you with what she wrote :-
" I am an university student in the collage of pharmacy , a daughter of a small and highly educated family , the youngest sister of one single brother and a kind married sister , we live in a city named “ Mosul ” in Iraq , in a simple house among kind neighbors ..
Being the youngest , my family deal with me in a special manner , and I love them in an incredible manner , specially my brother , we were more than sister and brother , we were close friends , each of us was ready to sacrifice his soul for the other , he was so kind guy , funny , lovely , so faithful , fair , ambitious , had many aspirations also he did n’t hurt anyone even by a word .
He was a graduate of computer science collage , of Baghdad university , he changed his job many times due to security circumstances , and he was unable to find a job suitable with his experiences , at last he was working in a shop of so kind people , he loved and respected them a lot , his work place was dangerous but he had to work , to live and arrange his future .
As all Iraqis , he was always worry about the worsening situation which was life threatening and danger exists everywhere .
On 18/3/2008 , I woke up early to go to collage , unlike everyday , I left home without seeing and joking with him , because I was in a hurry .. during his job that day , a car - bomb exploded in his work place area and a metallic splint penetrated his clear and kind heart directly … by this way , I simply lost my only brother who was everything in my life , and till this moment I do n’t know why or what was his guilt to die in this young age !
When I knew about his death , I did n’t believe , until I saw him in the woody tomb , he was so white , sleeping as angel , also was smiling to me … we kissed him for the last time , and knew he went to heaven , because he was faithful , fair , kind person , also he died as a martyr ..
My parents became so weak , simply because they lost oldest and only son who was to held the family name , was to make his own family , was helping my daddy in this life , and was everything for all of us .
Sure I was sad too , and I found myself in a hard stance , I did n’t know what to do !!
Although all of our neighbors , and friends helped us but it was hard for us .
I cried till my tears finished , I became so sorry on all members of my family too , I was very worry about their health , then I started to think logically and found that I am lucky to have a brother in heaven , flying with angels , near our GOD as all innocents people in this world , also I am lucky to be surrounded by true friends , postgraduates , and undergraduates , kind Dr.s who teach me , and helpful people .. also I found that I ’ve to be strong to be able to carry my family ’s responsibilities , encourage them and fill his place .. not to lose them anymore , I know it is too much for a twenty one years old female , but I ’ve no choice , I love my brother a lot , so I am ready to bear anything for him , specially when I know he is in a place where only rare people can join .
Since I love him a lot , I decided to write these words as a message to him , telling him that I always wished the best for him and I am ready to do anything I can to tell the world about a person who was a diamond for us and is a candle who will keep to light up my life for ever , giving me hope for future , to make my dreams true , for myself , my family , and for my country , also his souvenirs will live with me every moment in my life and every time I look at the sky and stars ( as we always used to do ) .
I want my brother ’s story be a simple and direct message to the world , to have attention about those innocent Iraqis who die everyday without guilt and their spirits be stolen suddenly in such way ..
I ask everyone who reads my words , just to close his eyes for seconds .. feel me .. and imagine the hard life in which Iraqis are living in .. if you do , help us to object this situation in my country , because no one except god has right to take our spirits from us , because it is not fair .. also I ask you to pray for him to make his soul comfort , and his guilt to be forgiven and be happy by hearing your prayers
Yours ’ ,
The loyal sister ,
Rita Jan Thomas Poushijian . "

Very truthful , and powerful words , from an loyal sister ..
Sunshine
Five years , nearly 4,000 dead Americans , millions of killed or displaced Iraqi civilians and $ 500 billion later , George W. Bush still thinks the Iraq war was a good move .
In remarks leaked on the eve of his speech marking the anniversary of the war , the president says the high costs “ are necessary when we consider the cost of a strategic victory for our enemies in Iraq . ”
His words once again betray his strategic incompetence .
“ This is a fight America can and must win , ” the president will say .
Of course , he ca n’t explain what victory is , outside of some vague notion of stability , some incoherent sense that America has weakened the morale of terrorists by restoring order to a country it degraded .
But we ’ve heard this argument already , and perhaps that is what is so sad .
We do n’t expect Bush to take responsibility for the worst foreign policy disaster in American history .
But at the very least , if he ca n’t think of something new to say , if he ca n’t come even an inch closer to reality , then on this miserable anniversary the least he could do is say nothing at all .
Blocking Big Brother Constitutional Court Unplugs Data Law
After 30,000 Germans filed a class- action suit , Germany 's constitutional court in Karlsruhe blocked large parts of a new data - collection bill lawmakers say will help stop terror attacks .
Opponents say it goes too far .
