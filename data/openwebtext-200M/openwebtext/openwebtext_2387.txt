Under the bailout plan for the nation ’s banks unveiled on Tuesday , no heads will roll , as they did in the United Kingdom .
No banking executives are likely to go hungry , either .
But their parting may not be quite as sweet .
The Treasury ’s plan seeks to take aim at the eight - figure pay packages given to Wall Street executives that have enraged so many Americans in the wake of the country ’s financial collapse .
Banks that get an equity infusion from the government will have to follow some general rules on paying their top five executives .
They will be restricted from offering golden parachutes , as rich severance packages are called , and they will have to pay more taxes if an individual ’s compensation exceeds $ 500,000 .
“ The key will be how they implement it , ” said Representative Barney Frank , Democrat of Massachusetts , who is chairman of the House Financial Services Committee and has long sought to restrict executive pay .

Enlarge By H. Rumph Jr. , AP Brewers manager Ned Yost is ejected by home plate umpire Larry Vanover during a game in Philadelphia in May .
He compiled a record of 457-502 ( .477 ) during his six seasons in Milwaukee .
QUICK QUESTION QUICK QUESTION
The Milwaukee Brewers , desperately looking to end their September collapse and 26 - year playoff absence , fired manager Ned Yost Monday with 12 games remaining in the season .
The move marks the latest point in a season a manager has been fired with his club in playoff position , according to the Elias Sports Bureau .
The Brewers have lost 11 of their last 14 games but are tied with the Philadelphia Phillies for the lead in the wild - card race .
DAILY PITCH : Brewers felt they had no other choice PLAYOFF PICTURE : Wild - card standings " I never imagined that could happen in this game .
That 's awful " said Atlanta Braves manager Bobby Cox , one of Yost 's closest friends .
The two spent 12 years together in Atlanta .
" That 's unheard of .
They 're still tied for first .
That 's a sad commentary . "
The Brewers , who had a 5 ½ - game lead in the wild - card race on Sept. 1 , replaced Yost on an interim basis with third - base coach Dale Sveum .
The Brewers also hired Hall of Famer Robin Yount to replace bench coach Ted Simmons .
" Our play was very unproductive and lethargic the last few weeks , " said Brewers general manager Doug Melvin .
" We asked ourselves if there was some way to jump - start the club with 12 games left .
We discussed coaching changes , player moves , roster moves , but we 're running out of time . "
Yost , whose team went 20 - 7 in August , did not return a message on his cellphone .
He was frustrated , Melvin said , but understood the decision .
" Ned had pretty much exhausted everything he could think of , " Melvin said .
" Dale brings a different voice .
We just hope the chemistry is such that we can turn things around . "
The move comes after the Phillies swept four games from the Brewers .
Milwaukee was outscored 26 - 10 with its starting pitchers lasting 17 innings and yielding a 10.06 ERA .
" The series was a complete and total disaster , " left fielder Ryan Braun told reporters Sunday .
" It could n't have gone any worse .
They could n't have played any better .
We could n't have played any worse .
We can only go in one direction from here .
It 's not going to get worse . "
The Brewers , who had an 8 ½ - game lead in late June last year before fading in the second half , have collapsed in nearly all phases of the game in September .
They have been outscored 75 - 38 and are hitting just .207 with a 4.68 ERA .
" I do n't think it was necessarily his fault , " Braun said Monday .
" We really like him as a person , we really like him as a manager , but they had to do what they felt was best for us as a team to get to the postseason .
" There 's 12 games left , and if they think making a change is what 's best for us , then they had to make that move . "

Poll watchers could be an effective tool to moderate the kinds of voting process abuses seen in 2004 .
You can't stop the abuse but you can be a witness to it and that may come in handy if there are legal challenges after the election .
I have been reading that this year as in 2004 the Republicans are planning to field an army of poll watchers to challenge voters and continue the kinds of vote suppression and intimidation that occurred previously .
The major targets are the battleground states .
The DNC is advertising for poll watcher volunteers on the DNC website and you can sign up by filling out a simple e-form .
link here :
http://www.democrats.org/page/s/nlcpollwatch
This might be an activist approach that people who are interested in insuring a fair process can take .
Election Judge positions commit you to a minimum 14 hour day but many states have no control over the number of hours poll watchers have to work except for designating minimum times to be present during vote counting or to be allowed back in without formal on - site approval if you leave for any reason .
Your hours would be controlled by the party which seems to make provision for short times on duty and your State requirements depending on the job you would do for your party .
Poll watching could be an alternative for those of us that can't commit to 14 - 16 hour days and may be worth mentioning .

I hope they invite you back - the issue could use about 412 hours of prime - time media coverage in the next several weeks .
Your remark on Missouri being one of the ground zero states is correct .
I live there and we 're using the ES&S iVotronic touch screen machines and optical scanners .
Machines so flawed you can't even determine if they failed , flipped , were hacked or operated correctly ; it 's a totaly faith - based voting system ; ^ ) '.... the horror , the horror . '

Do n't blame her .
If you have any problems with this , you can reach me @ 1 - 800 - EAT - SHIT ( you saw that coming ??? ) .
And do n't worry about cursing , it will be outlawed when the religious zealot Sarah Palin is president when McCain croaks between 2008 - 2012 .

Sarah Palin , " understands " the foreclosure crisis ... she does n't know Fredy Mac / Fannie Mae are privately run .
She 's got " executive experience " !!!
You should be worried about that ... not cursing ...
We know she existed for ONE WEEK so far , wait until some MORE time goes by !
They did vet her , did n't they ?
You know , John McCain , who met her ONCE and said they were " soul mates " !
Worry about the cursing , though ...

Just about to download the podcast , happy listening ahead .
BTW , Ken is completely off base with his remark about Czaragorn 's moniker .
Not surprising as Republicans really do n't know what the hell is going on in the world today , nor do they have any sense of history .
Ken , for the record , a " Czar " is , was , and always has been , an emperor , an " imperialist " despot .
The root of the word is the latin " Caesar " , from which " Kaiser " and " Shah " are also derived .
About as far as you can get from a socialist , if you are considering the actual meaning of the word as representative of an adherent to a socialist economic system .
Boy , you guys really do get your shit bass - ackwards , do n't you .
And the truly funny thing is that you think you 're being some kind of clever .
BTW , does your inference also mean that you would consider the " drug czar " a socialist also ?
Just curious .

IBD ( pro-business , conservative daily ) cited the Harvard Study and RealClearPolitics respectively as sources .
It was left to them to report empirical research that was intentionally omitted by the MSM .
ALso , note that all but 2 major polls had Bush winning the 2004 election .

There is a notable difference between Rush and Brad when compared to the mainstream media that you dont consider .
Rush is acknowledged as a conservative voice , Randi and Brad are acknowledged as liberal voices --- in contrast the media mislead under the guise of objectivity and journalist integrity ( i think we both agree that is an oxymoron ) I cited empirical studies from UCLA , Harvard , NYTImes , and major pollsters whose jobs depend on accurate unbiased results .
you have yet to answer why the pollster results on the eve of virtually every national election match the results of the actual election ?
Here are the polls for the senate races in 2006 --- the pollster nailed it in favor of the dems :
http://www.realclearpoli...cs_poll_averages-63.html
Here are the polls of the presidential race in 2004 --- the pollsters nailed it : http://www.realclearpoli...s.com/bush_vs_kerry.html
It is un-American , dangerous , and divisive that brad and other fringers would intentionally denigrate the election process when these professional pollster 's research supports the results .
Hell !
we are all for fairness and reliabiility at the polls , i dont want dems or republicans stealing elections .
in addition , it is ironic that whenever the democrats win --- the polls work , yet whenever the dems lose ..... furthermore , i challenge you to cite a shred of evidence to refute my sources that show the media overwhelmingly contributes cash to liberal candidates in the case of Obama by a 100 - 1 margin !!!
finally , i think it is unfair and bigoted to cite everyone who disagrees with you or is a conservative as a " troll "

For Helpless Robert -
Here 's one of those " fringe left " media studies you thought I 'd answer with :
https://bradblog.com/?p=6225
( Showing bias by the networks towards Obama , by the same guy previously lauded by Bill O'Reilly
Then there 's this ridiculous study , showing a " liberal media bias " by the GOP paid " academic " shill , Jeffrey Milyo :
https://bradblog.com/?p=5845
... And here 's Milyo suddenly forgetting who paid him for his study , while testifying to Congress :
https://bradblog.com/?p=5803
And then there 's Media Matter 's * empirical * study ( pure numbers ) of the political leanings of Sunday Talk Show guests over a period of years :
If it 's Sunday , It 's Conservative
... and the follow up , a year or so later :
If it 's Sunday , It 's Still Conservative BTW , Media Matters is wrong .
There is nothing " conservative " about most of those labeled as conservative in their study .
More appropriate would be " If It 's Sunday , It 's Rightwingers " .
I 'm more conservative in my little pinky then George W. Bush and his band of Constitution - hating friends and thugs ( apparently , much like Robert ) will ever be .
I 'm sure you wo n't bother to read any of those links , of course .
But after having read your silly studies about reporters donating to Dems ( the study did n't include corporate owners , who decide content , and their money to not - Dems ) I thought I 'd try to help you a bit .
It 's only your country and American values you have to lose .

For example , citing yourself to support your views is like citing the voices in your head .
it is not credible to cite personal opinion in the absence of objective , reliable , and credible evidence
It is hilarious that you would cite media matters as objective .
For example , I challenge you to cite a single commentary in this ridiculously biased website that is favorable to any conservative cause .
The contrast between my sources and yours is palpable .
FOr example , i cite UCLA , Harvard , Gallup , Ipsos , Rasmussan , CNN , NYTimes et al and you attack my sources as unreliable and not valid .

your quote brad : " ( the study did n't include corporate owners , who decide content , and their money to not - Dems ) I thought I 'd try to help you a bit .
It 's only your country and American values you have to lose . " brad , the harvard study debunks your assertion that the corporate leadership in the mainstream media influences its journalists to the extent that they would report favorably to the right .
In fact the study cites the opposite --- let me summarize for you again --- media reporting is unquestionably leftist !
In addition , your extreme views are why out of touch with mainstream Americans .
For example , the majority of Americans support the death penalty : http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/node/1450 support gun rights : http://www.cnn.com/2007/.../16/guns.poll/index.html oppose partial birth abortion : http://www.cnn.com/2007/.../16/guns.poll/index.html support drilling : http://www.rasmussenrepo...ect_it_will_lower_prices and now support the McCain Palin ticket : http://www.realclearpoli...mccain_vs_obama-225.html

A 60 second , single thread analysis of the poster known as " Ken . " 1 . the more negative you are ( esp on the personnel side )
2. no one can post another opinion w/o an attack or demeaning comment .
3. ( i.e. Obamma being associated with terrorists ? )
4. why so hostile , do you actually hate more than 50 % of this country ?
5. 911 ?? ( or event as I am sure you think of it )
6 . I know the left is terribly afraind of Palin - thats the reason for the desparate attacks
7. Czar ( not a reference to socialism I hope )
8. terrorism / war - see above - US first in my opinion
9. by the way how come so much hostilty and the need for profanity ?
10 .
I think the only hate comes from you and your " followers "
Could this be the roots of new psyop tactic , to set everyone up for an politically motivated , and government motivated preventative intelligence operation ?
Then ... Tick Tock ... Tick Tock ... Enter Robert .
Suddenly a challenge to the validity of sources .
Fascism vs . In the Public Interest , confusion of terms like " media bias " , " Right Wing " , " Left Wing " with the ONLY term that matters and is at the root of what 's wrong with the media ... " fascism "
And no I do n't trust CNN , NYTimes , Gallup , et al .
Since that have proven over and over to blacklist things like : Sibel Edmonds
Electronic Vote Device Fraud
Voter Caging
What is left or right about those issues ?
NOTHING .
It 's FASCISM .
And it could very well be the beginnings of politically motivated intelligence operations we are witnessing here .
Somewhere on this blog there 's a saying , " it 's not a matter of left and right , it 's a matter of right and wrong . "
Election integrity is such an issue .
There 's right and there 's wrong , and what has happened to our elections is wrong .
And it 's not investigated in depth to shine a light on it until it is fixed by the fascist corporate alphabet channels .
ALL OF EM !
That 's why they are not trusted .
They are not in the Public Interest .

thanks to two monday night games !!!
i will humor my amusing leftist for a little while longer since you have provided respectable arguments for me to counter for example , Bluebear2 and the studies he cited from " bastion of conservatism " the rolling stones mag no less states that exit poll data confirms polling manipulation .
I counter with the following facts and logic offered by a fellow blogger on another site : Before jumping to contusions , please consider an alternative ' conspiracy ( ? ) ' theory ...
http://www.renewamerica..../columns/wambough/050107
This looks a lot more plausible , since the MSM bias is well enough documented , not to mention their deliberate misreporting of events in favor of the DNC as evidenced by poor Mr. Rather 's untimely " retirement " to just cite the most infamous example .
Not only is it plausible , but statistical analysis of actual votes vs. exit - polls could be spun to indicate ( falsely ) that the vote tallies were the problem .
You know , like those pesky butterfly ballots that everyone blames the GOP for , when they were designed by local Dems in conjunction with the DNC .
In fact , though they are different situations , the methodology is strikingly similar .
The inserting deliberate flaws that can later be used in their favor seems to be a recurring theme .
I suggest we look for more of those , and not allow them to hijack the debate by keeping it focused as far away from the source of the problem as possible .
It 's a lot easier for a biased clatch of networks with national reach and a semblance of credibility to massage exit poles , which are NOT subject to stringent regulations or under lock and key , than for anyone to pull off a national manipulation of ballots , which are .
in addition , the left cannot explain or rationalize the parallel results from more valid , reliable , respected and professional pollsters ( when compared to inexact exit poll methodology ) that matched the election results in 2004 of course the left is big on minutia , circumstantial and anecdotal evidence ( easily jaded exit poll data ) in the absence of the overwhelming preponderance of facts ( millions of dollars in research conducted by nationwide professional pollsters dependent on " getting it right " ) .
Note that every conspiracy theory has its origin in a tidbit of inconsequential truth aggressively reported in the rolling stones or media matters and adopted " lock , stock , and barrel " by the leftist horde who remain firmly insulated on leftist blogs

Perhaps we should start out with agreement on the terms involved .
I would start with something simple as wikipedia where disagreement can be changed in nearly real time .
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_Bias
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizen_media
( Public Access TV falls under this )
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_media
( by definition it's not in the public interest )
http://en.wikipedia.org/...ght+wing+media&go=Go
( There is no such thing as " Right Wing Media " )
http://en.wikipedia.org/...eft+wing+media&go=Go
( There is no such thing as " Left Wing Media " )
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainstream_Media
( The term " MSM " or " mainstream media " has been widely used in the blogosphere in discussion of the mass media and media bias . )
It 's " fascism " , citing sources .
Now if your disturbed by what I said , that 's maybe a good thing , since we now have the validity .
I really do n't care about objectivity , as I am not a Journalist .
As far as questioning my rationality , that 's pretty much objective as to which side of the problem your on .
e.g. Your a. ) for upholding the oath of office , and the constitution , citizen oversight , accountability , and the rule of law , or b. ) for destroying the constitution , an " executive gone wild " , dark government with secrets , destruction / obstruction of evidence , no public oversight or accountability .
My source for taking an oath , is the USAF .
My source for turning people into criminals who have done nothing wrong , are the 2004 RNC , MacArthur Park Police Riot of 2007 , GASSED BY RIOT POLICE AT DNC 2008 , 2008 RNC , Arrest of Amy Goodman - Democracy Now ! and other credentialed members of the Media , Raiding homes with Journalists in St Paul , John Brakey arrested .
Add to this FISA with no oversight , Patriot Act , and a DOJ that is serving Justice for " JustUS . "
With this activity there is no law of the land .
A further breakdown of the initial 60 second analysis
The KEYWORDS used to deceive observers to this thread :
negative attack terrorist hostile hate 911 attacks terrorism / war hostility The INSINUATION ( quoting Ken ) : I think the only hate comes from you and your " followers " -=-=-=-
We should all be on the terrorist watch list with that Rovian logic .
But you see , this logic creates criminals , where there were none .
This is that whole everyone 's a terrorist mindset that has propagated out of the Bush administration 's bullshit " war on terror . "
Now you have idiot 's running around " crying wolf . "
If they know so much about these terrorists , why do they need a god damn list , why not just go get them ?
You want more sources cited , go look them up yourself .
This country has been turned into a god damned circus in the last eight years .
And any little attempts to keep attacking free speech by using politically motivated intelligence operations backed by the government need to be seriously punished , as that is completely unacceptable .
I hope your happy with all the sources , that 's guaranteed to make sure my message will be delayed because of all the URL 's involved .
OH yeah One Last Link for you , in case you still think I am disturbed instead of invalid , non-objective instead of reliable or rational , or maybe I am manufacturing phantoms now ?
Wooooo , or Boogeyman Ahhhhhhh !
Or maybe my Logic is different than the electronic voting machines , or maybe I habla espanol , Big5 , or unintelligible und gewöhnlich linksgerichtet anstelle anstelle verständlichem und von ehrlichem .
Okay ,
You can finish translating that later .
It 's just some sub rant about being intelligent and honest .
What is more important right now is for you to see
The truth about political use of intelligence operations on the public , and on Journalists .
Peace

All of your sources are extreme leftwing opinion .
Apparently , you did n't even bother to read the first link I sent you ( a study by a source that wingnut whackjobs Bill O'Reilly and Glen Beck have used / lauded in the past )
For example , citing yourself to support your views is like citing the voices in your head .
I did n't source myself , genius .
I linked you to articles with information and original sourcing within them .
Do n't bother to read them , as you may accidentally learn something .
it is not credible to cite personal opinion in the absence of objective , reliable , and credible evidence I did n't .
But do n't bother to find that out .
It is hilarious that you would cite media matters as objective .
Yes , counting numbers , transparently , is objective .
No matter who does it .
If you count how many Republicans versus how many Democrats appear on a number of shows over a period of time , that is objective ( and the basis for the MM study ) .
If you object to their methodology , as I have objected to Jeffrey Milyo's fake " academic " studies , then I 'm sure you 'll let us know what problem you have with it ( as we did , in regards to Milyo ) .
For example , I challenge you to cite a single commentary in this ridiculously biased website that is favorable to any conservative cause .
Virtually every article on this blog deals with support of the Constitution and the Rule of Law .
Until you guys hijacked the party , those used to be conservative causes .
Beyond that , I 'm not Google , and your an operative .
So you can go searching for yourself to find the various actual Conservatives ( and Republicans ) who we 've supported on this blog .
As to your next comment , presuming to know my opinion on things like the Death Penalty , Drilling , Abortion , etc. you 've got all the smarts and vetting skills of John McCain .

Can you address this question :
Is this big surge in the polls towards John McCain , and all this euphoria about Sarah Palin " real " ?
or is this just being manufactured by the Mainstream Media ?
How could anyone actually believe that a Bush - Cheney " Yes man " like John McCain , who voted for the interests of Cheney / Bush / Halliburton / Exxon-Mobile /etc. 95 % of the time , is a " maverick " about anything ?
Clearly McCain 's track record proves he is nothing but a puppet who serves the interests of the elite corporate overclass that has hijacked this Country and robbed the Nation .
Who then are all these people flocking to McCain , when 2/3rds of the Nation are against the Iraq Invasion , against the Bush Economy , and against the loss of our civil liberties ?

Interestingly and entertainly , Brad ’s rant about the George Mason media bias research showing television network news as bias against Obama reflects a very narrow time period ( six weeks ) and an extremely narrow sample size ( only network news ) .
More hilarious and discrediting to Brad is the following research from the same research team that shows that Fox news is the most balanced reported service and that Obama was unquestionably afforded the most positive coverage during the primaries .
http://cmpa.com/Studies/...12_21_Election_Study.pdf
No wonder Hillary supporters are overwhelmingly moving to the McCain / Palin ticket .
Furthermore , while I cited comprehensive empirical research from the entire spectrum of media , brad predictably finds his support among the narrowest of samples and time periods .
More to come .
Thanks for the source Brad !!!

While Brad attacked the research from UCLA , he has remained silent in regard to the other myriad sources I cited above :
Note that I always cite numerous , objective , and varied sources to support my arguments while brad cites his blog ( voices in his head ) and other fringe left wing sources ( Media matters for example ) I cited Ipsos , Gallup , Harvard , UCLA , Rasmussan , Pew , NYTimes , CNN , et al and brad predictably focuses his rebuttal on one source .
I challenged him to rationalize the parallel between the overwhelming majority of pollsters that are successful in predicting elections on the national level --- and brad predictably posts his usual extreme fringe blog or conspiracy website with contextually false and misleading bias .
I also cited opinion polls of Americans views on major issues that are all counter to brad's extreme views to illustrate the extreme nature of his thinking relative to mainstream America and he has yet to respond with anything but inane retorts .
more to come .

Robert 's unbiased source : Center for Media and Public Affairs Foundation funding Media Transparency documents that between 1986 and 2005 CMPA received 55 grants totaling $ 2,960,916 ( unadjusted for inflation ) .
[ 6 ]
The data reveals that the overwhelming proportion of CMPA 's funding comes from conservative foundations .
...........
Thus , out of the total of $ 2,960,916 in foundation grants , nearly all of it ( $ 2,668,916 ) came from just four sources : the John M. Olin , Scaife , and Smith Richardson foundations .
In other words , CMPA received 86 % of its foundation funding from those four donors .
Here is a sample of other right - wing causes funded by these 3 donors , as listed by their respective SourceWatch articles : * John M. Olin Foundation - American Enterprise Institute , Project for the New American Century
* Scaife Foundations - American Enterprise Institute , Heritage Foundation
* Smith Richardson Foundation - American Enterprise Institute , Hudson Institute Fair and balanced indeed : George Mason University - Parent of CMPA
It became a " magnet for right - wing money " [ 1 ] during the 1990s .
From 1992 through 1994 , 12 right - wing foundations invested a combined total of $ 8.55 million in various academic programs and institutes of George Mason University .
It was this funding that help establish ( and continues to support ) the University 's unrivaled set of right - wing " study centers " , which aim to recruit and support young , free - market - oriented students - typically through paid - for " study trips " , seminars , and placements .
The Mercatus Center is currently the main focus of right - wing funding .
Between 1999 and 2001 , the Mercatus Center was the third largest recipient of conservative foundation money ( a position previously held by the Institute of Humane Studies )
As you claimed it is the same source Brad used .
But then that flies in the face of your claim Brad uses only liberal sources does n't it ?

With respect to brad's praying at the altar of media matters misinformation and bias note the following regarding media matters sophomoric and unscientific " research " regarding the ideological bent of SUNDAY morning talk show guests !!!!
hilariously , i cited serious objective academic research across the entire spectrum of media and brad cites his lynchpin of media bias on three networks on sunday morning .
you have to admit if nothing else brad is entertaining .
First , during the clinton admin predictably more progressives appeared on tv --- in contrast during the bush admin more conservatives .
duh brad --- didnt see that coming did you ?
Second , the study 's size and scope was pitifully narrow .
for example john mccain 's numerous appearances on sunday significantly jaded the studies results .
Hilariously this study may be more important in identifying which pols in washington are night persons and morning persons .
Third , the study just cited appearances by progressives or conservatives yet it did not identify whether these appearances were adversarial or informational .
we all should know that many of these appearances are adversarial .
for example , confrontation sells advertising .
Lastly , brad i feel sorry for you .
i cite comprehensive studies from NYTimes , Pew , UCLA , HArvard and poll data acquired after millions in research by Ipsos , CNN , Gallup , Rasmussen et al --- and the best you can counter with is sunday morning talk show guests on four networks .
keep drinking the kool aid buddy .
And I eagerly await the entertaining juvenile and vicious ad hominen attacks void of fact , logic and empiricism .

Note that brad cited GMU's ( extremely narrow study in size and scope ) to support his nonsense of conservative bias in the media --- and I turned it around on him by using another study by the same research group that debunked his claim .

starting to see a pattern here folks ?
the fringe that listen to randi , brad , et al are rendered incapable of objective , rational , and independent thought by the extreme content on these fringe blogs and website that they are mesmerized by note that the adherents to these cites are beguiled by the minutia , anecdotal and circumstantial evidence typical of paranoid conspiracy theorists while they disregard the preponderance of physical evidence and logic that debunks their warped interpretation of reality .
For example , randi , brad , and virtually every listener to this show probably believes 9/11 was an inside job .
it is a study in paranoid delusion : 1 . Persecutory paranoia or ( foxnewsophobia ) -
This is the most prevalent type of paranoia , and in this patient makes himself believe that all those around him are his enemies ( Neocons --- MSM --- Foxnews ) , bent on harming him or even taking his life .
In this delusion people of an aggressive temperament often turns dangerous killers .
2 . Delusion of Grandeur -
In this patient believes himself to be , a great individual , and according to Bleuler , this delusion of grandeur accompanies a persecutory delusion .
3 . Reformatory paranoia -
In this the patient turns to considering himself a great reformer ( Brad ) .
He accordingly looks upon all those around him .
As suffering from dangerous disease , and believes that he is their reformer and curator .
4 . Litigious paranoia -
In this kind the patient takes to feeling meaningless cases against other people and feels that people are linked together to bother him .
Sometimes he , even tries to murder .
5 . Hypochondrical paranoia -
In this kind the patients believes that he is suffering from all kind of ridiculous diseases ( Randi 's bizarre wandering of late ) , and also that some other people are to blame for his suffering .

Right Wing Watch has posted audio of two threatening voice mail messages .
Transcripts follow below the fold .
These are not safe for work , folks .
The clips and email headers have been edited only to remove personally identifying information , like the name of the Cleveland - based ACORN staffer who " is going to have her life ended , " according to one email .
During the final debate , John McCain accused ACORN of possibly destroying the fabric of our democracy .
As night follows day , the nation 's largest grassroots community activist group has been deluged with vile , racially charged voice mails and emails .
“ Hi , I was just calling to let you all know that Barack Obama needs to get hung .
He 's a fucking nigger , and he 's a piece of shit .
You guys are fraudulent , and you need to go to hell .
All the niggers on oak trees .
They 're gonna get all hung honeys , they 're gonna get assassinated , they 're gonna get killed . ”
And ...
" You liberal idiots .
Dumb shits .
Welfare bums .
You guys just fucking come to our country , consume every natural resource there is , and make a lot of babies .
That 's all you guys do .
And then suck up the welfare and expect everyone else to pay for your hospital bills for your kids .
I just say let your kids die .
That 's the best move .
Just let your children die .
Forget about paying for hospital bills for them .
I 'm not gonna do it .
You guys are lowlifes .
And I hope you all die . "
Meanwhile , John McCain is indignantly defending his barrage of robocalls accusing Obama of being involved with a domestic terrorist who bombed the Pentagon .
Ironically , McCain hired the same firm that smeared him in the South Carolina primary to run the anti-Obama calls .

The financial crisis has hit the eurozone worse than had been expected
The eurozone has officially slipped into recession after EU figures showed that the economy shrank by 0.2 % in the third quarter .
This follows a 0.2 % contraction in the 15 - nation area in the previous quarter from April to June .
Two quarters of negative growth define a technical recession .
The news was widely anticipated and follows data showing that Germany and Italy , two of the biggest eurozone economies , are already in recession .
BBC Berlin correspondent Steve Rosenberg said the figures were not a surprise .
Looking ahead , we can expect further quarters of negative GDP growth , until the third quarter of 2009
Gilles Moec , senior economist , Bank of America Is France in denial ?
" The Germans had their gloomy economic news [ on Thursday ] and as Germany is the dynamo of the European economy , when there are problems there , it drags the rest of the region down with it , " he said .
It is the first recession the region has seen since the euro 's creation in 1999 .
But analysts forecast worse to come for the countries that use the euro .
" Looking ahead , we can expect further quarters of negative GDP growth , until the third quarter of 2009 , simply because so far we have not had in the GDP figures the full impact of the credit market crisis , " said Gilles Moec , senior economist , Bank of America .
READ NEWS RELEASE Eurostat indicators [ 130.82KB ]
Most computers will open this document automatically , but you may need Adobe Reader Download the reader here " We also have n't yet seen the full impact of unemployment on consumer spending , " he added , forecasting that the eurozone region will shrink by 1 % next year .
European blues
The gloomy forecasts are being fuelled by the uncertainty relating to the financial panic and slowing exports exacerbated by the strengthening euro against the dollar and pound .
Carmakers - major European employers - are suffering particularly badly with data from the European carmakers ' association , Acea , showing car sales down 14.5 % in October for the sixth month in a row .
The sharp decline in exports has winded Germany - one of the world 's largest economies - with data out on Thursday showing it had shrunk 0.5 % in the third quarter , following a 0.4 % drop in the second quarter .
The Italian and Spanish economies followed suit , also shrinking in the third quarter .
For Spain , it was the first such drop since 1993 .
Analysts are now convinced that a slump in household spending and a property crisis are likely to push the Spanish economy into recession as well , in the next quarter .
Much to the surprise of most analysts , France 's economy bucked the trend and expanded in the third quarter , supported by consumer spending and company investment .
Official data showed that the French economy grew by 0.1 % in the June to September period .
More interest rate cuts ?
HAVE YOUR SAY
If the biggest eurozone economies are in recession , smaller countries are having even more difficulties Liliana Jarmela , Portugal The European Central Bank this month lowered its key interest rate to 3.25 % to kick - start the eurozone 's flagging economy and more cuts are expected as it becomes clearer that inflation risks are now retreating .
The Eurostat statistics agency said that annual inflation had come down to 3.2 % in October from 3.6 % in September , as oil prices have more than halved since reaching a peak above $ 147 a barrel in July .
Some analysts are predicting they could go as low as 2 % - the same level they stood when the eurozone was formed in 1999 .
Meanwhile , the wider European Union ( EU ) , made up of 27 countries , is also in danger of slipping into a recession with the region 's output shrinking by 0.2 % in the third quarter , after flat growth in the previous three months .

In an attempt to protect the Juruena river in western Brazil , an estimated 120 members of the Enawene Nawe tribe occupied the construction site of a hydroelectric dam on October 13 , and then burned it to the ground .
“ They came armed with axes and pieces of wood , banished the employees and later set fire to everything ” said Frederico Muller , a coordinator working at the site .
At least 12 trucks were destroyed , along with a number of offices and housing units .
All told , Muller suggests that there was at least a million dollars in damages .
Reporting on the action , Survival International says that right now , there are 77 dams slated for construction along the river .
“ The Enawene Nawe say [ these dams ] will pollute the water and stop the fish [ from ] reaching their spawning grounds . ”
The Enawene Nawe see this is a major threat because the relatively isolated tribe depends on fish for survival .
They are one a few tribes in the world that do not hunt or eat red meat .
Fish also plays a crucial role in their customs and traditions …
They say that if the fish get sick and die , then so will they .
Before the Enawene took action , they had been taking part in a “ consultation process ” ( information exchange ) with authorities , where they learned the full extent of the development .
It exceeded far beyond what they had been told up to now , prompting the Enawene to immediately walk away .
Given the Enawene ’s loud response , some form of reprisal can unfortunately be expected .
If you would like to support the Enawene Nawe , you can send a letter online that urges the demarcation of their land .

For the first time in recorded human history , the Arctic has become an island to itself , completely separate from the landmasses that the Arctic ice normally stretches out onto .
This distressingly historic event has been captured by NASA satellites , depicting both the Northwest and Northeast passages as ice free .
For the past few years we have seen the Arctic ice sheet melt , dropping to lower and lower levels .
And though we have n’t seen the 2008 melt season drop below 07 ’s record numbers , the ice has melted in such a way that now the Arctic has become an island .
The Telegraph quoted Professor Mark Serreze , a sea ice specialist at the National Snow and Ice Data Centre ( NSIDC ) in the US , as saying that the Arctic may have entered a “ death spiral ” caused by global warming .
Already shipping companies are making plans to cut thousands of miles of their sea - bound journeys .
And Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper has announced that ships intending on passing through the Northwest Passage must first report to the Canadian government .
The images have been gathered by NASA , who continually monitors the space around Earth , but Earth itself .
The images show that the Northwest Passage opened last weekend , and the last impediment on the east side melted a few days later .
This is having a direct influence on the wildlife as well .
Late August saw reports of nine polar bears swimming in open ocean off Alaska ’s northwest coast , in the Chuckchi Sea .
Many of the polar bears , as well as some walruses , were swimming north and ranged from 15 to 65 miles offshore .
Intriguing side - note ; the Chuckchi Sea is where people like Republican Vice Presidential candidate Sarah Palin are hoping to drill for oil .
That would n’t hurt the polar bears chances of survival , would it ?

I n a rare and edifying display of bipartisanship , congressional Democrats and Republicans appeared on Thursday morning to have reached agreement on an unprecedented $ 700 billion bailout of America 's crippled financial system .
But it was not to be .
John McCain , who had no part in the bailout negotiations , had to be seen as a player in rescuing the system from its paralysis .
Meanwhile , free - market purists among House Republicans believed the White House - sponsored plan to save what remains of the American financial system was a step on the road to socialism .
And that GOP faction was also convinced that the process was being rushed along so McCain would not be seen to be part of whatever reclamation project emerged .
McCain made a great show Wednesday suspending his campaign so he could be in D.C. to help save the republic from financial ruin .
And he bowed out of the presidential debate scheduled for last night , challenging Democratic rival Barack Obama to follow McCain 's selfless example .
Obama was having none of it .
He said now is precisely when Americans want to hear from their next president about the candidates ' plans to revive the economy .
That " as candidates , we should be able to do more than one thing at a time . "
And that the injection of presidential politics in the delicate bailout negotiations would do more harm than good .
General hilarity greeted this latest McCain stunt .
By his own repeated confession , McCain is untutored in economics .
At best , he could help with the Thai food orders that sustained the congressional negotiators in their late - night sessions this week .
Obama was right .
The arrival in D.C. of both McCain and Obama , resulting from a George W. Bush invitation solicited by McCain , was followed by a collapse in the negotiations Thursday night , after the House Republicans withheld their support .
But not before a rancorous White House meeting in which a well - briefed Obama grilled U.S. Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson , author of the bailout package for which Bush was fighting , while an unhelpful McCain spoke so little that no one present could recall what he said .
Earlier this week , McCain 's flop sweat was showing as he tried to cut and run from last night 's debate .
It had foreign policy as a theme , but McCain fretted he would be asked about his role in a 1980s savings and loan scandal .
And about his record as a diehard opponent of the regulatory oversight that could have prevented the current financial crisis .
So , as with the stunt of selecting the unqualified Sarah Palin as his running mate , McCain tried again to change the subject .
The Palin effect is waning , even before her straight - to - YouTube encounter with Katie Couric in which the rookie Alaska governor tried to establish her foreign - policy credentials by correctly identifying Russia and Canada as her state 's neighbours .
With America refocused on the economy , approval ratings for both McCain and Palin have shifted into reverse .
But Obama called McCain 's bluff , insisting the debate would go ahead even as a one - on - one between himself and moderator Jim Lehrer .
So McCain , who did n't suspend his campaign at all – his attack ads continued to run nationwide – caved in and jetted to the Mississippi debate site rather than let Obama have a TV audience of 40 million to himself .
Washington was not in angst about McCain 's departure , or surprised that he was changing his mind yet again , having earlier vowed not to debate until a bailout deal was reached .
Representative Barney Frank , a Massachusetts Democrat and the House Financial Services Committee chair , said , " We 're trying to rescue the economy , not the McCain campaign . "

It 's time for me to wear my special hat again .
The Fedora developer community has announced the official release of Fedora 10 , a new version of the popular open source Linux distribution .
This release is a promising step forward for Fedora and it introduces some important new features and technologies that bring more robustness and usability to the desktop user experience .
Fedora 10 is built on Linux kernel version 2.6.27 , which was officially released in October .
This version of the kernel comes with improved compatibility for popular webcam devices and also includes the new Atheros ath9 k wireless driver .
Firefox 3.0.4 , the latest bugfix release of the popular open source web browser , is also included in the default installation .
KDE and GNOME in Fedora 10
Fedora 10 offers installation options for both GNOME 2.24 and KDE 4.1 , the latest versions of the two most popular Linux desktop environments .
GNOME 2.24 , which was released in September , introduced the Empathy instant messaging client and also brought tabbed browsing and other improvements to GNOME 's Nautilus file manager .
Empathy is built on the Telepathy instant messaging framework and is designed to supply audio / video chat functionality and significantly tighter desktop integration than the incumbent Pidgin messaging program .
Although Empathy shows an enormous amount of promise and could prove to be a big step forward for GNOME messaging , it is still very rough around the edges and is missing some features .
Some distributions — including Ubuntu — have declined to ship Empathy in recent releases .
It was initially included in the Fedora 10 release candidate , but it was swapped back out for Pidgin in the final release at the very last minute .
Users who want to try Empathy can install it from the repository , but Pidgin is still the default in this release .
My own testing has confirmed that it is sufficiently robust for day - to - day use , but I think it really needs a bit more time to bake before it will be crispy enough to beat Pidgin in a taste test .
The Fedora developers are committed to ensuring that KDE is well - supported in the distribution , but they have faced some challenges because of the significant differences between the KDE and Fedora development cycles .
KDE 4.0 was shipped with Fedora 9 and KDE 4.1 was pushed later along with some features that were backported from the trunk .
It looks like we will see a similar move in Fedora 10 — the OS ships with KDE 4.1 and will likely be updated when KDE 4.2 is released at the end of January .
KDE 4.1 , which was released in July , finally delivered on the next - generation desktop promise of the KDE 4 series .
KDE 4.2 will continue to advance the desktop environment and bring more robustness and usability .
Significant new features
One of the most significant new features in Fedora 10 is glitch - free PulseAudio ( PA ) .
The PA sound server — which was originally included in Fedora 8 — brings a whole new set of modern capabilities to the Linux audio stack and has important features like support for controlling the volume of individual audio streams , moving audio streams between devices , and outputting audio streams simultaneously to multiple devices .
It also has some really impressive advanced capabilities , like dynamic volume adjustment and network transparent stream redirection using Avahi for network autodiscovery .
PA represents an enormous advancement for the Linux audio experience , but the transition has been challenging .
The new glitch - free version of PulseAudio smooths out some of the rough edges .
It is a rewrite that implements timer - based audio scheduling .
This will significantly reduce the potential for dropped audio and will facilitate better handling for latency .
It could also potentially boost battery life by cutting down on the number of interrupts .
This effort has been championed by Red Hat 's Lennart Poettering and Fedora is the first distribution in which it will be included by default .
Fedora 10 also includes a new version of the Network Manager utility , which is used to configure Fedora 's connectivity settings .
The new version has built - in support for connection sharing .
This is useful in a variety of contexts , particularly when a user with a 3G card wants to share it with other computers via an ad hoc WiFi network .
Fedora 's RPM package management system got a major overhaul for this release .
RPM 4.6 has many new features and a cleaner code base .
Some legacy limitations have been eliminated and the maximum file size within packages has been increased to 4GB .
For a complete list of RPM improvements , read the draft of changes that have been made since RPM 4.4.x at the RPM web site .
PackageKit , a generic package management frontend with a user - friendly graphical interface and support for programmatic manipulation through a D - Bus API , is more tightly integrated in Fedora 10 .
It is now integrated with GStreamer and can automatically install codecs when the user encounters media formats that are not natively supported .
Fedora will still not include or provide access to patent - encumbered codecs , however , so users will have to configure third - party repositories in order for the feature to work .
Some startup improvements have been implemented in Fedora 10 , too .
Using readahead helped the Fedora developers reduce the startup time by roughly ten percent .
This is also the first Fedora release to use Plymouth , a new graphical startup system that does n't require an X server .
The new graphical boot display does n't work on all hardware , but there is a text - based fallback for instances in which it fails .
The Fedora developers have published a video that shows Plymouth in action .
A little late , but worth the wait
The Fedora 10 release arrived a few weeks later than originally planned because the project 's servers were infiltrated in August by malicious hackers .
This security breach forced extensive audits and made the Fedora developers take some of the key infrastructure offline .
The systems were brought back up after the group confirmed that Fedora source code had not been manipulated or compromised .
Despite the challenges faced during the development process , Fedora 10 is a strong release with lots of polish and an excellent assortment of new features .
The user experience is great and the software performed well during my tests .
Fedora 10 is available today from the project 's web site .
The HTTP mirrors typically get hammered , so we recommend using BitTorrent .
For more details , see the official release notes .
This article was amended on Thursday November 20 2008
A sentence has been removed .
Furthermore , we apologise to Betsy Andreu for comments made about her in this interview .
She has asked us to clarify that , while evidence that she gave in proceedings about an insurance claim brought by Lance Armstrong is disputed , she honestly recounted what she believed she had heard .
The sweat is still drying on Lance Armstrong 's gaunt face when , with sunken eyes as blue as the cloudless sky , he sweeps through the front door of his home in the secluded hills of Austin , Texas .
Armstrong offers a hand while balancing a pile of training gear on his arms .
" Sorry , I 'm late , " he says .
" It 's been a busy day . "
He disappears as quickly as he arrived and I slide back on to the plush sofa of the vast room where I 've been waiting .
Huge paintings of minimalist pop art hang on the walls .
Ed Ruscha 's Speed Racer and Safe and Effective Medication echo the backdrop of cycling , cancer and doping allegations which have made Armstrong one of the world 's most famous but controversial sportsmen .
An elegant woman drifts past to check whether I need another sparkling water .
The temptation is to mumble that a definitive dollop of truth would suffice for no other athlete divides the planet like Armstrong .
He could be the greatest sportsman of all time , an epic and courageous figure who overcame cancer to win seven straight Tour de France titles from 1999 to 2005 .
In the alternate view , however , he simply cheated his way to victory with performance - enhancing drugs .
The ferocious split between believers and critics was illustrated when I canvassed the experts before arriving in Austin .
I barely had to mention Armstrong 's name to be assailed by a furious response from European journalists who had covered his exploits for years .
" Horror - show " and " disgrace " were two of the milder terms of denigration .
And yet , interviewing Bradley Wiggins in September , I was taken aback by the Olympic champion 's delight just a few days after Armstrong announced his comeback .
Wiggins , whose vehement stance against doping has long been enshrined , appeared an unlikely ally of Armstrong .
So who do you believe ?
A maverick racer like Wiggins or a coterie of specialist reporters ?
" I do n't care who you believe , " Armstrong drawls .
We sit at a big round table , in touching distance of his seven blue
Tour titles on the bookshelf , while Armstrong hunches over a bowl of soup and a cup of green tea .
" I understand people in France and in cycling might have that perception but the reality is that there 's nothing there .
The level of scrutiny I 've had throughout my career from the press and the anti-doping authorities is unmatched .
I 'm not afraid of anything .
I 've got nothing to hide .
There are seven cups in this room because of my hard work .
This next year wo n't be any different - even if people hate to hear that .
I 'm going to be focusing on every aspect of the bike , the team , the strategy , the training , the hard work , the sacrifice .
There are no secrets .
To the critics I would say , believe it or not , there are exceptional athletes out there .
Michael Phelps ... Paula Radcliffe ... "
But neither Phelps nor Radcliffe has been engulfed by swaths of circumstantial evidence , or links to proven drug cheats .
" There has been a fair amount of suspicion around me , and a hell of a lot of suspicion around cycling .
If the guys who finished second , third and fourth behind Phelps were all busted then people would say , ' Hey , wait a minute .
He beat 'em all - how the hell is that possible ? ' "
Armstrong nods meaningfully , conceding why there are such doubts about him .
The last time he stood on the podium in Paris , in 2005 , he said he felt " sorry " for all the poor saps who doubted him and the integrity of the Tour .
And yet the two men who shared his podium were both exposed as dopers .
What did he think when Ivan Basso and Jan Ullrich were busted ?
" Egg on my face , " Armstrong says softly .
" But look at the Brits on the track this year - absolutely outstanding .
And still the head of French cycling said their performance ' is not possible ' .
Give me a break .
Bradley Wiggins is the best fucking pursuiter of all time .
I do n't think he cheated .
So if I could talk to your cycling buddies I would say , ' Just fucking relax .
We 're not talking about God .
We 're not talking about war .
We 're not talking about you losing every dime you had .
We 're talking about bike - racing ' . "
Yet we are talking about doping .
Three years ago L'Equipe published their claim that a sample of Armstrong 's urine from the 1999 Tour had been retested and found to contain traces of EPO .
They published their apparent exposé under a banner headline of " The Armstrong Lie " .
" I remember the call .
This house was still under construction and I was in the backyard with the contractor .
At the time I thought , ' OK , whatever ' - even if it was a big ' whatever ' .
There was hysteria and they got this big independent commission to investigate .
" Cycling , like the world , is very divided .
One side finally said , ' OK , the independent commission cleared him so we 're moving on ' .
The other side said , ' I do n't believe the independent commission ' .
But the report was very clear and we were ready to go to the international tribunal with the lab , with Wada [ the World Anti-Doping Agency ] and the French government - and they declined .
Now they come back and say ' OK , we 'll now let you test those samples to prove your innocence ' . "
Armstrong pushes his cup towards me .
" Here 's your sample , " he says , " and the lid is now off it .
Something might have been put in it and your life , your credibility depends on it , but now I put the lid back on .
Now we come and test it .
Nobody in their right mind would take that test .
The commission cleared me and L'Equipe itself said , ' The athlete in question has no way to defend himself ' .
I 'm all for drug controls but if the athlete cannot defend himself , what kind of kangaroo court is that ? "
Setting aside the possibility of tampered evidence Armstrong 's first sample contained a residue of EPO - a fact he explains away by arguing that he used a cream for saddle sores during his first Tour win without any knowledge that it included a banned substance .
Various other people also claim that he admitted to past doping .
Is Emma O'Reilly , his former physiotherapist on the US Postal team , simply a liar - she claimed that Armstrong had asked her in 1998 to dispose of a bag of syringes containing EPO ?
" We all know the names .
Emma O'Reilly , Steven Swart [ his former team - mate who admitted using EPO ] , David Walsh [ the respected Sunday Times journalist and author of LA Confidential : The Secrets of Lance Armstrong ] and Prentice Steffen [ an ex-professional cyclist who told L'Equipe that " the bad guys , like Armstrong , dope " ] .
We sued David Walsh in the high court and won .
The prosecutor in Paris opened a federal investigation and we were completely cleared .
We had another arbitration case in Texas and were vindicated again . "
Betsy Andreu , whose husband Frankie raced with Armstrong , claims she heard the cyclist tell doctors treating him for cancer that he had taken performance - enhancing drugs .
" Her husband lived , trained and raced with me and he said , under oath , ' I have never seen Lance take performance - enhancing drugs ' . "
Armstrong 's past links with Dr Michele Ferrari , the Italian physician charged with various doping offences , are more damaging .
" Yeah - but more was made of that relationship than existed .
And I 'm not going to kick a family friend out of my life .
There are those relationships but look at the real data .
Nobody had more scrutiny than me . "
As part of his mission to prove himself clean on his return Armstrong will be tested daily by Don Catlin , an independent analyst , who will post his results online .
But trouble continues to brew .
" I do n't want to enter an unsafe situation but you see this stuff coming out of France .
There 're some aggressive , angry emotions .
If you believe what you read my personal safety could be in jeopardy .
Cycling is a sport of the open road and spectators are lining that road .
I try to believe that people , even if they do n't like me , will let the race unfold . "
Does he fear being violently attacked on next year 's Tour ?
" Yeah .
There 're directors of French teams that have encouraged people to take to the streets ... elbow to elbow .
It 's very emotional and tense . "
There is also something compulsive about Armstrong 's comeback , which can be seen both in his craving to succeed and the fascination surrounding his tilt against the odds .
Comparing his fitness at this stage of the season with past years he insists : " I 'm much better physically now .
And mentally there is no comparison .
I 'm far stronger and more motivated .
The motivation of 2008 feels like the motivation of 1999 .
I was back from cancer then .
I had the motivation of vengeance because nobody wanted me or believed in me . "
Nine years later Armstrong sounds more vulnerable than vengeful .
" I have anxiety and insecurity about being 37 .
Let 's not forget I 'm the oldest tour winner in modern cycling history and that was four years ago .
But that nervousness makes me work even harder .
We 're doing a training camp in December in Tenerife and another in California with big climbs .
Normally I would n't smell a mountain until February so I 'm starting early . "
Armstrong will begin the new year in Australia before he returns for the Tour of California and more racing in France and Switzerland , followed by his debut in the Giro d'Italia .
" I regret not riding the Giro before .
But their 100th anniversary and starting in Venice and finishing in Rome made it irresistible .
That 's the beauty of this comeback .
You lay out different scenarios in your head .
What if you won the Tour again ?
Or the Giro ?
Or if you won them both ?
Or you lost them both ?
You lay it all out and I 'm still up for it . "
Armstrong suggests that running marathons led to him agreeing to get back on his bike in the 100 - mile Leadville Trail in August , the day his comeback began .
" Leadville climbs 12,500 feet and I felt good the first six hours .
It was only in the last hour I ran out of fuel because I had n't done enough miles .
But I finished just behind Dave Wiens , a former world champion whose whole season revolves around that race . "
For a man who has often said losing is akin to dying , Armstrong looks briefly satisfied with that second place .
But , deadly serious on the bike again , and beyond the claim that he is aiming mainly to raise money for his cancer foundation , Armstrong is plainly chasing an eighth Tour victory .
" When people have cancer it 's black and white - they live and they win .
They lose and they die .
I take that same mentality into sport - to win .
My friends on the team were always quite surprised that I was n't that excited to win .
They 'd say : ' Are n't you excited ?
You just won the Tour de France for the seventh time ? '
I was ' Yeah , it 's pretty cool ' .
It would have been very different if I had lost .
But now if I 'm able to win again , any race , it might be different this time round .
We 'll see . "

Akon was quoted saying ;
" If he ( Obama ) does n't get into office , I am going to change my citizenship .
I am moving back to Africa .
You can hold me to that .
I am afraid to live there if he ( McCain ) is President .
" I do n't think he is going to last 8 years so she 's definitely going to be President .
Oh my goodness - that 's scarier . "
Akon is n't fond of McCain but he 's equally skeptical of his running mateIt will be interesting to see what happens if McCain can pull off a victory .

Obama remarks on Iran nuclear issue come under fire
TEHRAN , Nov 8 ( AFP ) Nov 08 , 2008
Iran 's parliament speaker Ali Larijani slammed US president - elect Barack Obama on Saturday for saying Tehran 's pursuit of nuclear weapons was " unacceptable , " the official IRNA news agency reported .
" This signifies a pursuit of the same erroneous policy as in the past , " Larijani said when asked about Obama 's comment on Friday .
" If the United States wants to change its standing in the region it should send good signals , " he said .
" Obama understands that change does not only mean a change of colour and superficial differences , change must also have a strategic basis , " the agency quoted Larijani as saying .
Obama told his first news conference since winning the US presidential election on Tuesday that Iran 's pursuit of nuclear weapons was unacceptable and also that he would " respond appropriately " to a congratulatory letter from President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
" Iran 's development of a nuclear weapon I believe is unacceptable .
We have to mount an international effort to prevent that from happening . "
Obama added " Iran 's support of terrorist organisations , I think , is something that has to cease . "
IRNA also quoted Larijani as saying Iran 's leaders had chosen to pursue the country 's nuclear programme " having calculated the risks " and was well aware that they would come under international pressure .
" But this was necessary for the future of Iran , " he said , adding that the Islamic republic would not suspend its controversial programme of uranium enrichment despite UN Security Council resolutions and sanctions against it .
Enrichment is at the heart of Western fears that Iran could be seeking nuclear weapons as it can be diverted to make the fissile material for an atomic bomb as well as fuel for nuclear power plants .
Tehran insists that its nuclear ambitions are strictly peaceful and solely aimed at generating electricity .
Six major powers -- Britain , China , France , Germany , Russia and the United States -- have put forward the possibility of a package of technological , economic and political incentives if Iran suspends uranium enrichment .
Early in his election campaign , Obama said he favoured unconditional direct talks with Tehran , but he has since hardened his position .
Iran and the United States have not had diplomatic relations since Islamist students took American diplomats hostage for 444 days following the 1979 Islamic revolution which toppled the US - backed shah .
But in an unprecedented move , Ahmadinejad on Thursday sent a letter to Obama congratulating him on his election victory .
Conservative dailies also criticised Obama .
Kayhan headlined " Obama 's men pro-Israeli , " in reference to his appointment of Rahm Emanuel , a Jew , as White House chief of staff .
It called him " a member of a terrorist Zionist group . "
Jomhuri Islami's headline read : " Obama gives green light to the Zionist regime . "
Howard Zinn : ` Obama creates an opening for change but direct action needed '
October 22 , 2008 -- Real News Network -- Howard Zinn says vote against McCain , vote for Obama .
Even though Obama does not represent any fundamental change , he creates an opening for a possibility of change .
Obama will not fulfill that potential for change , unless he is enveloped by a social movement , which is angry enough , powerful enough , insistent enough , that he fills his abstract phrases about change with some content .
We need direct action , because only that kind of indignation is going to have some affect on the people in Washington .
Howard Zinn is an historian , political scientist , social critic , activist and playwright .
He is best known as author of the best - seller A People 's History of the United States .
Zinn has been active in the civil rights and the anti-war movements in the United States .
Paul Jay , senior editor , Real News Network :
Thank you for joining us .
Our interview with Howard Zinn .
Thank you , Howard .
So we 're just a few weeks away from the election .
Obama 's ahead in the polls , although Obama supporters are still holding their breath and talk about October surprises and this and that .
You 've written about the election process as not being as democratic as it would like to call itself or people would like to call it .
On the other hand , you still end up with the idea that people should participate , should vote , and I do n't think you quite said " holding your nose , " but with some reservation people should vote against McCain , vote for Obama .
Explain what your thinking on this is .
Yeah .
Well , you know , I 'm very sceptical about the US political process , which only gives voters a very limited multiple choice test .
You know , A or B ? Or A and A - prime ?
The Republicans or the Democrats ?
And almost always the Republicans and the Democrats are so close to one another in policy , I mean , not identical , but fairly close in policy , so that the person who wants bold changes in the way our society is going is not going to find them represented by either the Democratic or Republican candidates , and that 's still true with Obama and McCain .
However , there are certain moments in history when even a small difference between the candidates may be crucial , may be a matter of life and death for large numbers of people .
I mean , when the French had a change of presidency in France during the Algerian War , it made a difference in their bringing the Algerian War to an end .
And I think that there are such moments , and I think this may be such a moment in US history .
That is , we 've gone through an insufferable eight years with the Bush administration , probably the worst administration in history , and , I mean , two wars in one presidency , and a total disregard of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights , and a shattering of the economy .
And in this situation , we are desperate for change .
So even though Obama does n't represent any fundamental change , he creates an opening for the possibility of change .
That 's why I 'm voting for him ; that 's why I suggest to people that they vote for him .
But I also suggest that Obama will not fulfill that potential for change unless he is enveloped by a social movement which is angry enough , powerful enough , insistent enough that he fill his abstract phrases about change , fill them with some real , solid content .
The Nader supporters and some of the other third - party candidates will say , " Well , there is an alternative . "
No .
I interviewed Ralph Nader and I made the argument to him that there is n't a feasible alternative , and he says , " Well , yes there is .
It 's not feasible only when people keep saying it 's not feasible . "
But what do you say to Nader and the other third - party candidates who say , well , the only way to break this paralysis of the two - party system is to start voting outside it ? "
Well , you 're not going to break the paralysis of the two - party system within the party system .
In other words , you 're not going to break it in the electoral system by putting up a third - party candidate whose showing will inevitably be pitiful and will therefore only be a demonstration of the weakness of the movement outside of the electoral arena .
If you choose to go into the electoral arena , you 'd better go in with strength .
If you 're going with weakness , you are not doing a progressive movement any good .
To me it is a waste of Ralph Nader 's energy to throw himself into the electoral process , because his energy is best used by building a movement , by doing what he has done for most of his life very effectively , reaching out to millions and millions of people who will not vote for him but who really believe in his ideas , and help him to organize those people so that whoever is elected as president will then have to face a constituency , a citizenry which demands change .
Now , how does that movement develop now ?
I mean , let 's assume that Obama is going to win this election .
If the polls are right and there 's no , you know , extraordinary event — which I suppose nobody can rule out — but the world as we know it today , it looks like Obama 's going to win the election .
And I say that with some reservation , ' cause if something big happens in four days , it 's going to make this interview dated .
So we 'd better publish quickly .
But given that , how does an independent movement develop ?
What are the obstacles to a national movement of the type you 're talking about ?
Well , the obstacles are a kind of resignation that things will go on as before .
That 's always the obstacle to change .
The obstacle to change is not that people do n't want change .
People want change .
But most of the time , people feel impotent .
However , at certain points in history , the energy level of people , the indignation level of people rises .
And at that point it becomes possible for people to organize and to agitate and to educate one another , and to create an atmosphere in which the government must do something .
I 'm thinking of the 1930s ; I 'm thinking of Franklin D. Roosevelt coming into office not really a crusader .
Roosevelt came into office , you know , with a balance - the - budgets history .
It was not clear what he was going to do , and I do n't think he was clear about what he was going to do , except that he was going to be different from Hoover and the Republicans .
But when he came into office , he faced a country that was on strike .
He faced general strikes in San Francisco in Minneapolis .
He faced strikes of hundreds of thousands of textile workers in the South .
He faced a tenants movement and an unemployed council movement .
And he faced a country in turmoil , and he reacted to it , he was sensitive to it , he moved .
That 's what we will need .
We will need to see some of the scenes that we saw in the '30s .
And how do we get there ?
How do we get there ?
Well , we get there by somebody starting it off , like the four kids in Greensboro in 1960 who started off the sit - in not knowing whether it would spread .
We need somebody who is losing their home because they can't afford to pay their mortgage , we need them surrounded by their neighbors who then do not allow them to leave , do not allow their furniture to be taken away .
This is what happened in the '30s .
In other words , we need direct action , we need civil disobedience , we need to raise the level of tension in the country , because only that kind of indignation is going to have some effect on the people in Washington .
And in terms of building a movement that could give rise to a third party that actually had a chance — and in many countries of the world , parties do come and go — first of all , why have n't we seen some of that which one did see in the '30s ?
There were other parties that had some kind of weight .
And are we entering with this financial crisis a period where something like that might be possible ?
Well , third parties can have an effect on the existing parties .
I mean , in the 1930s it was n't a third party that won ; it was the fact that there was a movement throughout the country .
Part of it was socialist and communist , but a lot of it would be working people and tenants and so on , and they had an affect on the Democratic Party , which up to that point had not been a very militant or very energetic party .
As a result it had lost elections in the 1930s to non-entities like Harding and Coolidge .
But I think it 'll take the kind of energy that we had in the ' 30s to not necessarily create a third party that will win office , but that will transform the Democratic Party into what might be a third party , almost in the way that the Republican Party before the Civil War was transformed into a party that would do away with slavery or at least try to do away with slavery , even though that was not its primary objective .
If we 're looking at four years , maybe eight years , of a Democratic administration , and if that Democratic administration follows the previous course we 've seen from most of the people that are going to be leading it , then this movement is going to be directing a lot of its target or arrows at the Democratic administration .
Unquestionably .
If we have a Democratic administration , that administration has to be the target of a new social movement .
Problem with the years of the Clinton administration is that whoever in the United States really wanted to go beyond the Clinton administration in foreign policy and domestic policy became complacent , and they did not organize , and there was no real movement in the country in Clinton 's time , as there had been in 1960s , to push Clinton into any good direction .
That will have to be different when Obama and his administration come into office .

Can Obama see the Grand Canyon ?
On presidential blindness and economic catastrophe
By Mike Davis
October 15 , 2008 -- Common Dreams --
Let me begin , very obliquely , with the Grand Canyon and the paradox of trying to see beyond cultural or historical precedent .
The first European to look into the depths of the great gorge was the conquistador Garcia Lopez de Cardenas in 1540 .
He was horrified by the sight and quickly retreated from the South Rim .
More than three centuries passed before Lieutenant Joseph Christmas Ives of the US Army Corps of Topographical Engineers led the second major expedition to the rim .
Like Garcia Lopez , he recorded an " awe that was almost painful to behold . "
Ives 's expedition included a well - known German artist , but his sketch of the Canyon was wildly distorted , almost hysterical .
Neither the conquistadors nor the Army engineers , in other words , could make sense of what they saw ; they were simply overwhelmed by unexpected revelation .
In a fundamental sense , they were blind because they lacked the concepts necessary to organize a coherent vision of an utterly new landscape .
Accurate portrayal of the Canyon only arrived a generation later when the colourado River became the obsession of the one - armed Civil War hero John Wesley Powell and his celebrated teams of geologists and artists .
They were like Victorian astronauts reconnoitering another planet .
It took years of brilliant fieldwork to construct a conceptual framework for taking in the canyon .
With " deep time " added as the critical dimension , it was finally possible for raw perception to be transformed into consistent vision .
The result of their work , The Tertiary History of the Grand Canyon District , published in 1882 , is illustrated by masterpieces of draftsmanship that , as Powell 's biographer Wallace Stegner once pointed out , " are more accurate than any photograph . "
That is because they reproduce details of stratigraphy usually obscured in camera images .
When we visit one of the famous viewpoints today , most of us are oblivious to how profoundly our eyes have been trained by these iconic images or how much we have been influenced by the idea , popularized by Powell , of the Canyon as a museum of geological time .
But why am I talking about geology ?
Because , like the Grand Canyon 's first explorers , we are looking into an unprecedented abyss of economic and social turmoil that confounds our previous perceptions of historical risk .
Our vertigo is intensified by our ignorance of the depth of the crisis or any sense of how far we might ultimately fall .
Weimar returns in Limbaughland
Let me confess that , as an aging socialist , I suddenly find myself like the Jehovah 's Witness who opens his window to see the stars actually falling out of the sky .
Although I 've been studying Marxist crisis theory for decades , I never believed I 'd actually live to see financial capitalism commit suicide .
Or hear the International Monetary Fund warn of imminent " systemic meltdown . "
Thus , my initial reaction to Wall Street 's infamous 777.7 point plunge a few weeks ago was a very sixties retro elation .
" Right on , Karl ! " I shouted .
" Eat your derivatives and die , Wall Street swine ! "
Like the Grand Canyon , the fall of the banks can be a terrifying but sublime spectacle .
But the real culprits , of course , are not being trundled off to the guillotine ; they 're gently floating to earth in golden parachutes .
The rest of us may be trapped on the burning plane without a pilot , but the despicable Richard Fuld , who used Lehman Brothers to loot pension funds and retirement accounts , merely sulks on his yacht .
Out in the stucco deserts of Limbaughland , moreover , fear is already being distilled into a good ol ' boy version of the " stab in the back " myth that rallied the ruined German petite bourgeoisie to the swastika .
If you listen to the rage on commute AM , you 'll know that ‘ socialism ' has already taken a lien on America , Barack Hussein Obama is terrorism 's Manchurian candidate , the collapse of Wall Street was caused by elderly black people with Fannie Mae loans , and ACORN in its voter registration drives has long been padding the voting rolls with illegal brown hordes .
In other times , Sarah Palin 's imitation of Father Charles Coughlin -- the priest who preached an American Reich in the 1930s -- in drag might be hilarious camp , but with the American way of life in sudden freefall , the specter of star - spangled fascism does n't seem quite so far - fetched .
The Right may lose the election , but it already possesses a sinister , historically proven blueprint for rapid recovery .
Progressives have no time to waste .
In the face of a new depression that promises folks from Wasilla to Timbuktu an unknown world of pain , how do we reconstruct our understanding of the globalized economy ?
To what extent can we look to either Obama or any of the Democrats to help us analyse the crisis and then act effectively to resolve it ?
Is Obama FDR ?
If the Nashville " town hall " debate is any guide , we will soon have another blind president .
Neither candidate had the guts or information to answer the simple questions posed by the anxious audience :
What will happen to our jobs ?
How bad will it get ?
What urgent steps should be taken ?
Instead , the candidates stuck like flypaper to their obsolete talking points .
McCain 's only surprise was yet another innovation in deceit : a mortgage relief plan that would reward banks and investors without necessarily saving homeowners .
Obama recited his four - point program , infinitely better in principle than his opponent 's preferential option for the rich , but abstract and lacking in detail .
It remains more a rhetorical promise than the blueprint for the actual machinery of reform .
He made only passing reference to the next phase of the crisis : the slump of the real economy and likely mass unemployment on a scale not seen for 70 years .
With baffling courtesy to the Bush administration , he failed to highlight any of the other weak links in the economic system : the dangerous overhang of credit - default swap obligations left over from the fall of Lehman Brothers ; the trillion - dollar black hole of consumer credit - card debt that may threaten the solvency of JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America ; the implacable decline of General Motors and the American auto industry ; the crumbling foundations of municipal and state finance ; the massacre of tech equity and venture capital in Silicon Valley ; and , most unexpectedly , sudden fissures in the financial solidity of even General Electric .
In addition , both Obama and his vice presidential partner Joe Biden , in their support for Secretary of the Treasury Paulson 's plan , avoid any discussion of the inevitable result of cataclysmic restructuring and government bailouts : not " socialism , " but ultra-capitalism -- one that is likely to concentrate control of credit in a few leviathan banks , controlled in large part by sovereign wealth funds but subsidized by generations of public debt and domestic austerity .
Never have so many ordinary Americans been nailed to a cross of gold ( or derivatives ) , yet Obama is the most mild - mannered William Jennings Bryan imaginable .
Unlike Sarah Palin who masticates the phrase " the working class " with defiant glee , he hews to a party line that acknowledges only the needs of an amorphous " middle class " living on a largely mythical " Main Street . "
If we are especially concerned about the fate of the poor or unemployed , we are left to read between the lines , with no help from his talking points that espouse clean coal technology , nuclear power , and a bigger military , but elide the urgency of a renewed war on poverty as championed by John Edwards in his tragically self - destructed primary campaign .
But perhaps inside the cautious candidate is a man whose humane passions transcend his own nearsighted centrist campaign .
As a close friend , exasperated by my chronic pessimism , chided me the other day , " do n't be so unfair .
FDR did n't have a nuts and bolts program either in 1933 .
Nobody did . "
What Franklin D. Roosevelt did possess in that year of breadlines and bank failures , according to my friend , was enormous empathy for the common people and a willingness to experiment with government intervention , even in the face of the monolithic hostility of the wealthy classes .
In this view , Obama is MoveOn.org 's re-imagining of our 32nd president : calm , strong , deeply in touch with ordinary needs , and willing to accept the advice of the country 's best and brightest .
The seath of Keynesianism
But even if we concede to the Illinois senator a truly Rooseveltian or , even better , Lincolnian strength of character , this hopeful analogy is flawed in at least three principal ways :
First , we can't rely on the Great Depression as analog to the current crisis , nor upon the New Deal as the template for its solution .
Certainly , there is a great deal of déjà vu in the frantic attempts to quiet panic and reassure the public that the worst has passed .
Many of Paulson 's statements , indeed , could have been directly plagiarised from Herbert Hoover 's Secretary of the Treasury Andrew Mellon , and both presidential campaigns are frantically cribbing heroic rhetoric from the early New Deal .
But just as the business press has been insisting for years , this is not the Old American Economy , but an entirely new - fangled contraption built from outsourced parts and supercharged by instantaneous world markets in everything from dollars and defaults to hog bellies and disaster futures .
We are seeing the consequences of a perverse restructuring that began with the presidency of Ronald Reagan and which has inverted the national income shares of manufacturing ( 21 % in 1980 ; 12 % in 2005 ) and those of financial services ( 15 % in 1980 ; 21 % in 2005 ) .
In 1930 , the factories may have been shuttered but the machinery was still intact ; it had n't been auctioned off at five cents on the dollar to China .
On the other hand , we should n't disparage the miracles of contemporary market technology .
Casino capitalism has proven its mettle by transmitting the deadly virus of Wall Street at unprecedented velocity to every financial center on the planet .
What took three years at the beginning of the 1930s -- that is , the full globalisation of the crisis -- has taken only three weeks this time around .
God help us , if , as seems to be happening , unemployment tops the levees at anything like the same speed .
Second , Obama wo n't inherit Roosevelt 's ultimate situational advantage -- having emergent tools of state intervention and demand management ( later to be called " Keynesianism " ) empowered by an epochal uprising of industrial workers in the world 's most productive factories .
If you 've been watching the sad parade of economic gurus on McNeil - Lehrer , you know that the intellectual shelves in Washington are now almost bare .
Neither major party retains more than a few enigmatic shards of policy traditions different from the neo-liberal consensus on trade and privatisation .
Indeed , posturing pseudo - populists aside , it is unclear whether anyone inside the Beltway , including Obama 's economic advisors , can think clearly beyond the indoctrinated mindset of Goldman Sachs , the source of the two most prominent secretaries of the treasury over the last decade .
Keynes , now suddenly mourned , is actually quite dead .
More importantly , the New Deal did not arise spontaneously from the goodwill or imagination of the White House .
On the contrary , the social contract for the post - 1935 Second New Deal was a complex , adaptive response to the greatest working - class movement in our history , in a period when powerful third parties still roamed the political landscape and Marxism exercised extraordinary influence on American intellectual life .
Even with the greatest optimism of the will , it is difficult to imagine the American labour movement recovering from defeat as dramatically as it did in 1934 - 1937 .
The decisive difference is structural rather than ideological .
( Indeed , today 's union movement is much more progressive than the decrepit , nativist American Federation of labour in 1930 . )
The power of labour within a Walmart - ized service economy is simply more dispersed and difficult to mobilize than in the era of giant urban - industrial concentrations and ubiquitous factory neighborhoods .
Is war the answer ?
The third problem with the New Deal analogy is perhaps the most important .
Military Keynesianism is no longer an available deus ex machina .
Let me explain .
In 1933 , when FDR was inaugurated , the United States was in full retreat from foreign entanglements , and there was little controversy about bringing a few hundred Marines home from the occupations of Haiti and Nicaragua .
It took two years of world war , the defeat of France , and the near collapse of England to finally win a majority in Congress for rearmament , but when war production finally started up in late 1940 it became a huge engine for the reemployment of the American work force , the real cure for the depressed job markets of the 1930s .
Subsequently , American world power and full employment would align in a way that won the loyalty of several generations of working - class voters .
Today , of course , the situation is radically different .
A bigger Pentagon budget no longer creates hundreds of thousands of stable factory jobs , since significant parts of its weapons production is now actually outsourced , and the ideological link between high - wage employment and intervention -- good jobs and Old Glory on a foreign shore -- while hardly extinct is structurally weaker than at any time since the early 1940s .
Even in the new military ( largely a hereditary caste of poor whites , blacks , and Latinos ) demoralisation is reaching the stage of active discontent and opening up new spaces for alternative ideas .
Although both candidates have endorsed programs , including expansion of Army and Marine combat strength , missile defense ( aka " Star Wars " ) , and an intensified war in Afghanistan , that will enlarge the military - industrial complex , none of this will replenish the supply of decent jobs nor prime a broken national pump .
However , in the midst of a deep slump , what a huge military budget can do is obliterate the modest but essential reforms that make up Obama 's plans for healthcare , alternative energy , and education .
In other words , Rooseveltian guns and butter have become a contradiction in terms , which means that the Obama campaign is engineering a catastrophic collision between its national security priorities and its domestic policy goals .
The fate of Obama-ism
Why do n't such smart people see the Grand Canyon ?
Maybe they do , in which case deception is truly the mother 's milk of American politics ; or perhaps Obama has become the reluctant prisoner , intellectually as well as politically , of Clintonism : that is say , of a culturally permissive neo-liberalism whose New Deal rhetoric masks the policy spirit of Richard Nixon .
It 's worth asking , for instance , what in the actual substance of his foreign policy agenda differentiates the Democratic candidate from the radioactive legacy of the Bush Doctrine ?
Yes , he would close Guantanamo , talk to the Iranians , and thrill hearts in Europe .
He also promises to renew the Global War on Terror ( in much the same way that Bush senior and Clinton sustained the core policies of Reaganism , albeit with a " more human face " ) .
In case anyone has missed the debates , let me remind you that the Democratic candidate has chained himself , come hell or high water , to a global strategy in which " victory " in the Middle East ( and Central Asia ) remains the chief premise of foreign policy , with the Iraqi - style nation - building hubris of Dick Cheney and Paul Wolfowitz repackaged as a " realist " faith in global " stabilisation . "
True , the enormity of the economic crisis may compel President Obama to renege on some of candidate Obama 's ringing promises to support an idiotic missile defense system or provocative NATO memberships for Georgia and Ukraine .
Nonetheless , as he emphasizes in almost every speech and in each debate , defeating the Taliban and Al - Qaeda , together with a robust defense of Israel , constitute the keystone of his national security agenda .
Under huge pressure from Republicans and Blue Dog Democrats alike to cut the budget and reduce the exponential increase in the national debt , what choices would President Obama be forced to make early in his administration ?
More than likely comprehensive health - care will be whittled down to a barebones plan , " alternative energy " will simply mean the fraud of " clean coal , " and anything that remains in the Treasury , after Wall Street 's finished its looting spree , will buy bombs to pulverize more Pashtun villages , ensuring yet more generations of embittered mujahideen and jihadis .
Am I unduly cynical ?
Perhaps , but I lived through the Lyndon Johnson years and watched the War on Poverty , the last true New Deal program , destroyed to pay for slaughter in Vietnam .
It is bitterly ironic , but , I suppose , historically predictable that a presidential campaign millions of voters have supported for its promise to end the war in Iraq has now mortgaged itself to a " tougher than McCain " escalation of a hopeless conflict in Afghanistan and the Pakistani tribal frontier .
In the best of outcomes , the Democrats will merely trade one brutal , losing war for another .
In the worst case , their failed policies may set the stage for the return of Cheney and Rove , or their even more sinister avatars .

Why I 'm not voting for Barack Obama
Todd Chretien makes the case that remaining independent of the two mainstream parties is necessary for building an effective struggle .
October 22 , 2008 -- Socialist Worker ( USA ) --" TERRORIST ! " " KILL him ! "
" He 's an Arab . " " Obama Bucks . "
John McCain has let the dogs loose .
Apparently , he 's decided that if winning the White House means whipping the right wing into a racist frenzy , he 'll lead the charge .
The good news is that a majority of American voters are walking away from the John McCain - Sarah Palin freak show .
Even David Letterman is grilling McCain .
In recent days , McCain even added the word " socialist " to Barack Obama 's supposed list of sins .
" You see , [ Obama ] believes in redistributing wealth , not in policies that help us all make more of it , " said McCain .
" At least in Europe , the socialist leaders who so admire my opponent are upfront about their objectives .
They use real numbers and honest language .
And we should demand equal candor from Senator Obama . "
Just this once , I find myself wishing that something McCain says were true .
Yet any serious look at Obama 's record and platform signal that he intends to govern well within the mainstream of American politics .
To begin with , there are his stated policies .
He wants to keep at least 50,000 troops in Iraq to " fight terrorism " indefinitely , and he wants to send those who are withdrawn from Iraq to fight in Afghanistan .
He agrees with John McCain that the size and budget of the American military must be increased , he stridently supports Israel 's suppression of the Palestinian people , and he has said " me too " to reasserting American military might in Latin America , being especially hostile to Venezuelan president Hugo Chávez .
Obama would be the first to repudiate the idea that he is any sort of anti-militarist or anti-imperialist -- and we should take him at his word .
Domestically , Obama recognizes , unlike McCain , that the era of reckless deregulation and neoliberal supremacy has run its course .
His policies will aim to re-establish order between the " hostile band of brothers , " as Marx called competing capitalists .
Yet no serious look at Obama 's policies indicates a plan to fundamentally reshape the American class system .
As Malcolm X once said , " You do n't stick a knife in a man 's back nine inches , and then pull it out six inches , and say you 're making progress . "
Obama may support some modest economic band - aids -- extending unemployment benefits , for example .
He 'll most likely make some reasonable policy shifts , undoing the craziest of the Republican excesses -- especially those that do n't cost much .
For instance , he 'll appoint centrists to the Supreme Court if he gets the chance ( although the justices most likely to retire are liberals or centrists anyway ) .
Obama will also end George Bush 's ban on stem cell research , and he 'll take modest steps to deal with global warming .
He might even reduce the number of anti-immigrant raids by Immigration and Customs Enforcement ( ICE ) .
But even if Obama has his way at every point , by the end of his first term in 2012 , the schools will remain underfunded , the prisons overcrowded , and the gap between the rich and the working class more or less unchanged .
Compared to the last eight years of Bush , any change will be seen as a good thing .
Obama 's modest reforms will most likely earn him a honeymoon for a longer or shorter period of time .
He also has the advantage that the Republican Party finds itself deeply divided , and those divisions will only increase if McCain loses badly .
But the modest changes Obama has promised fall far short of what is needed .
Ongoing wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and economic crisis will form the backdrop to Obama 's first term .
This calls for far more radical measures than Obama has contemplated , even in the most generous reading of his intentions .
This reality requires a serious political discussion about how to build a working - class movement that can change the rules of the game -- and it's in this context that the question of whether those who want to work for social change should vote for Obama must be discussed .
Historical perspective
First , some historical perspective is needed .
If the opinion poll trends hold up , McCain 's racist strategy will lose , and Obama will be elected the first African American president .
In a nation built on slavery , this will be an historic accomplishment and a cause to celebrate for every genuine opponent of racism and bigotry of all kinds .
This point deserves emphasis .
America 's economic wealth was literally extracted from the backs and minds of more than 10 generations of Black slaves .
This wealth was n't incidental to the nation 's fortunes .
Without slavery , there would have been no riches for Northern merchants and bankers , and no boom in Northern industry .
It took a ferocious Civil War to abolish slavery - - a conflict that demonstrated the tenacity of the slave owner 's defense of the system .
The freed slaves achieved a 10 - year period of partial democracy and reform in the South during Reconstruction .
Defended by heavily armed troops , they elected hundreds of African Americans to state legislatures and Congress .
This Southern revolution was drowned in blood , as the KKK lynched its way into power , leading to 80 years of apartheid - like legal segregation .
The heroic and bloody struggles of the civil rights movement finally broke Jim Crow 's back , paving the way to voting rights , affirmative action in education and jobs , the creation of a Black middle class , and the possibility of Barak Obama 's campaign .
All this is often dismissed as ancient history .
Yet it is worth remembering that when Barak Obama was born in 1961 , millions of African Americans were still legally barred from voting in the South .
Even when the history is acknowledged , it is often asserted that the wrongs have been righted , and Black people should stop " complaining . "
As if the racist taunts shouted out at McCain rallies are n't buttressed by a powerful system of institutional racism which guarantees that African Americans disproportionately go to the poorest schools , suffer the highest unemployment rate and account for 50 percent of the nation 's 2 million prisoners , although they constitute just 13 percent of the population .
Obama 's election will raise the hopes of millions of Black workers across the country .
Those who have suffered the brunt of American capitalism -- and its most important tool , racism -- will have a justifiable sense of pride at Obama 's rise .
And for those who believe that the white working class can be won over to the fight against racism in the interest of class - based solidarity , Election Day will show that , even when offered the chance to vote along racial lines ( first by Hillary Clinton and then by John McCain ) , tens of millions of white workers from all parts of the country will vote for Barack Obama instead .
None of this ends racism , but it certainly demonstrates the potential for interracial unity in the working class .
Left 's dilemma
Historically , the US left has faced this dilemma : try to transform the Democratic Party or try to build an alternative to its left .
During the last Great Depression , this choice was posed in particularly stark terms -- and although history never repeats itself , there are some important lessons to be learned from what happened then .
The stock market crash in October 1929 led to bank failures , factory closures and skyrocketing unemployment , as well as a rising level of working - class anger -- and , eventually , strikes , protests , union drives and all kinds of social protests .
The 1932 election of Franklin Delano Roosevelt has important parallels to Obama 's campaign .
He won in a landslide , replacing an unpopular and out - of - touch Republican administration , by promising a New Deal .
However , like Obama 's call for " change , " the content of that New Deal was meager when Roosevelt promised it on the campaign trail .
It was mostly designed to shore up the banks and business , while offering small reforms for workers and the poor .
Yet the combination of anger and hope proved electric .
Between 1934 and 1937 , millions of workers went on strike and created the most powerful unions in US history .
In that struggle , the American Communist Party grew from 7,000 members in 1929 to 80,000 by 1938 .
At first , it seemed like the working - class movement and Roosevelt were headed in the same direction .
As workers got more radical and organized , Roosevelt was forced to deliver more reforms ( Social Security , the National labour Relations Act , the Works Progress Administration jobs program , unemployment insurance , etc. ) .
In fact , it seemed so obvious to many political radicals that Roosevelt and the working class were headed in the same direction that when the Communist Party dropped its opposition to the Democratic Party ( on orders from Moscow ) and became Roosevelt 's biggest champion in 1935 - 36 , very few complained .
But as the unions and Communist Party came to see defending Roosevelt from the Republicans as the central priority , they began to oppose the kinds of strikes and street actions necessary to continue the process of winning ever - more radical reforms for fear of " scaring the center . "
Once this dynamic became dominant , the movement began to fall apart .
The abandonment of this independence destroyed the possibilities of building an independent labour party , one that could stand for workers ' rights , consistently fight racism and oppose US wars abroad .
And when Roosevelt , the Democratic Party and big funders who really ran the party felt threatened by the demands of the unions , Roosevelt pre-emptively turned against the movement .
On Memorial Day 1937 -- just months after Roosevelt won re-election with the overwhelming support of organized labour -- police shot and killed 10 striking steelworkers in Chicago .
It was then that FDR issued his infamous " a plague on both your houses " remark about the strike , which gave the green light to the bosses to use violence against the union movement .
By 1938 , the New Deal economic policies had utterly failed to end the Depression .
Instead , there was a dramatic worsening of the economy .
At this point , Roosevelt turned towards building a massive war machine to fight the Second World War .
This would include developing and dropping the atomic bomb in the interest of spreading the American empire to Europe , Africa , the Middle East and Asia .
The Democrats , having sidetracked the possibility of breaking the two - party cycle in the 1930s , then helped launch the anticommunist McCarthyite crusade , a war in Korea , the Cold War with the USSR and , eventually , the war in Vietnam .
How to use opportunities
No one has a crystal ball , but it appears that global capitalism is entering a historic period of crisis .
The question of how to use the opportunities this will open up so that we do n't repeat the mistakes the left made in the 1930s will be crucial if we want a different outcome this time .
I believe that voting and giving political support to Barack Obama and the Democratic Party will weaken the fight for a fundamentally different kind of world , a socialist world .
Arguing against a vote for Obama and the Democrats is not political abstention , however .
It is part of a larger strategy that argues positively to continue building a socialist movement , based on the independence of the working class from the two mainstream parties .
There are many dedicated activists who will disagree with this point of view .
They look forward , above all , to seeing the Republicans defeated after eight long years of George Bush .
But can they make a positive case that Obama and the Democrats will take us closer to breaking the domination of the rich over the working class in this country ?
The fact that millions of American workers look set to elect the first Black president is a good barometer of what could be .
But it 's no substitute for systematic political debate and the patient building of social movements , socialist organisation and practical action .

I ’m assuming that you already have a project that you ’re working on that you would like to test .
There are two different ways of putting tests inside of your django project .
You can add a tests .
py file and put your tests inside of there .
You can also define a tests / directory and put your tests in files inside of that .
For these tutorials it is assumed that the second is the way things are done .
It makes it a lot easier when you can break your tests out into logical files .
These can go in two places inside your django project .
You can put them in your models .
py file , in the Docstring for your modules .
This is a good way to show usage of your models , and to provide basic testing .
The official docs have some great examples of this .
The other place your Doctests can go is inside your tests directory .
A doctests file is usually pretty simple .
A doctest is just a large string , so there is n’t much else to put besides a string .
Usually you want to use the triple quote , multi-line string delimiter to define them .
That way your ” and ‘s inside of your doctests do n’t break .
" " " This is my worthless test . >>> print " wee " wee >>> print False False " " "
You can go ahead and put that in a file in your tests / directory , I named it doctst.py .
I did n’t name it doctest , because of the python module with the same name .
It ’s generally good to avoid possible name overlaps .
My application that I ’m writing tests for is mine , because it ’s the code for my website .
Make sure that directory has an __init__.py as well , to signify that it is a python module .
Now here is the tricky part ; go ahead and try and run your test suite .
In your project directory run ./manage .py test APPNAME .
It will show you that you have passed 0 tests .
0 tests ?
We just defined one .
You need to go into your __init__.py file and put some stuff in there .
import doctst __test__ = { ' Doctest ' : doctst }
You are importing the doc test module and then adding it to the __test__ dictionary .
You have to do this because of the way that python handles looking for doc tests .
It looks for a __test__ dictionary inside of your module , and if that exists it looks through it , executing all docstrings as doctests .
For more information look at the Python docs .
Now you should be able to go ahead and run the tests and see the magical Ran 1 test in 0.003s OK that all testers live for .
This is little bit of overhead really threw me off when I was trying to break my tests .
py out into the tests / directory .
Notice that the doc test runner sees all of your tests as one single test .
This is one annoying thing that the doctests do .
So now we have a test suite that is worthless , but you know how to use doc tests .
If you did n’t notice , the doctest format is simply the output of your default python shell , so when you are testing your code on the command line and it works , you can simple copy and paste it into your tests .
This makes writing doc tests almost trivial .
Note however , that they are somewhat fragile , and should n’t be used for everything .
In the next segment , we will talk about unit tests .
Then we will compare the two and see what the use cases are for each .
Alternate Bailout Bill
The buzz on Washington and Wall Street is about the bailout and its fate , with Rep. Peter DeFazio , D- OR
HENDERSON , Nev. 
At grocery stores across Las Vegas , voters are casting their ballots , and then shopping for bananas or hitting the slot machines a few feet away .
About 100 people have voted from the windows of their cars , A.T.M. style , in Orange County , Calif .
Several busloads of voters pulled up to the Cuyahoga County Board of Elections in Cleveland on Sunday , did what they came to do , and then repaired to a church across the street for some fried chicken .
In all its forms , early voting has been an election year hit .
Enormous lines in Florida led Gov. Charlie Crist to issue an executive order extending early voting hours statewide from eight hours a day to 12 , while in Georgia an elderly woman in Cobb County stood in the sun so long to vote that she collapsed .
For many , an early vote has been a stab at ending , at least in their own homes and hearts , the seemingly endless loop of campaign rhetoric , cascading polls and tension , according to interviews over the past several days with dozens of early voters in six states .
For most of the election , Sen . John McCain 's campaign has been somewhat subtle about trying to tie Sen. Barack Obama to the former ' 60s radical William Ayers .
No longer .
A 90 - second Web ad released Oct. 8 , 2008 , features sinister music , side - by - side photographs of Obama and Ayers , and a series of dubious allegations about their past connections , including this one :
" Ayers and Obama ran a radical education foundation together . "
Ayers was a founding member of the militant Vietnam - era anti-war group the Weathermen .
He was investigated for his role in a series of domestic bombings , but the charges were dropped in 1974 due to prosecutorial misconduct .
He is now an education professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago , and actively engaged in the city 's civic life .
The McCain campaign said the " radical education foundation " to which they were referring is the Chicago Annenberg Challenge , a charity endowed by publishing magnate Walter Annenberg that funded public - school programs in Chicago from 1995 to 2001 .
We 'll look at whether the foundation was radical .
But first we have to grapple with whether Obama and Ayers ran it .
Obama served on the foundation 's volunteer board from its inception in 1995 through its dissolution in 2001 , and was chair for the first four years .
So an argument can be made that he ran it , though an executive director handled day - to - day operations .
Ayers , who received his doctorate in education from Columbia University in 1987 and is now a professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago , was active in getting the foundation up and running .
He and two other activists led the effort to secure the grant from Annenberg , and he worked without pay in the early months of 1995 , prior to the board 's hiring of an executive director , to help the foundation get incorporated and formulate its bylaws , said Ken Rolling , who was the foundation 's only executive director .
Ayers went on to become a member of the " collaborative , " an advisory group that advised the board of directors and the staff .
However , Ayers " was never on the board of the Chicago Annenberg Challenge , " and he " never made a decision programmatically or had a vote , " Rolling said .
" He ( Ayers ) was at board meetings — which , by the way , were open — as a guest , " Rolling said .
" That is not anything near Bill Ayers and Barack Obama running the Chicago Annenberg Challenge . "
Now , was the foundation radical ?
The McCain campaign cited several pieces of evidence for that allegation , including a 1995 invitation from the foundation for applications from schools " that want to make radical changes in the way teachers teach and students learn . "
The campaign appears to have confused two different definitions of the word " radical . "
Clearly the invitation referred to " a considerable departure from the usual or traditional , " rather than " advocating extreme measures to retain or restore a political state of affairs . "
The campaign also cited two projects the foundation funded , one having to do with a United Nations - themed Peace School and another that focused on African - American studies .
" That is radical in the eye of this campaign and we imagine in the eyes of most Americans , " said Michael Goldfarb , a spokesman for McCain .
" It is a subjective thing , and there are going to be people in Berkeley and Chicago who think that is totally legitimate . "
Teaching about the United Nations and African - American studies may not be everyone 's cup of tea , but it 's hardly " radical " in the same way Ayers ' Vietnam - era activities were .
Moreover , most of the projects the foundation funded ( more on that below ) were not remotely controversial .
The McCain campaign also cited an opinion piece by conservative commentator Stanley Kurtz in the Sept. 23 , 2008 , Wall Street Journal as evidence of the foundation 's radicalism .
Kurtz wrote that Ayers was the " guiding spirit " of the foundation , and it " translated Mr. Ayers 's radicalism into practice . "
But Ayers ' views on education , though certainly reform - oriented and left - of - center , are not considered anywhere near as radical as his Vietnam - era views on war .
And even if they were , there was a long list of individuals involved with the Chicago Annenberg Challenge whose positions provided them far more authority over its direction than Ayers ' advisory role gave him .
Let 's look at a few , starting with the funder .
Annenberg was a lifelong Republican and former ambassador to the United Kingdom under President Richard Nixon .
His widow , Leonore , has endorsed McCain .
Kurtz might just as plausibly have accused Obama and the foundation of " translating Annenberg 's conservatism into practice . "
Among the other board members who served with Obama were : Stanley Ikenberry , former president of the University of Illinois ; Arnold Weber , former president of Northwestern University and assistant secretary of labor in the Nixon administration ; Scott Smith , then publisher of the Chicago Tribune ; venture capitalist Edward Bottum ; John McCarter , president of the Field Museum ; Patricia Albjerg Graham , former dean of the Harvard University Graduate School of Education , and a host of other mainstream folks .
" The whole idea of it being radical when it was this tie of blue - chip , white - collar , CEOs and civic leaders is just ridiculous , " said the foundation 's former development director , Marianne Philbin .
The foundation gave money to groups of public schools – usually three to 10 – who partnered with some sort of outside organization to improve their students ' achievement .
In his opinion piece , Kurtz puts a sinister spin on this : " Instead of funding schools directly , it required schools to affiliate with ' external partners , ' which actually got the money ... CAC disbursed money through various far - left community organizers , such as the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now ( or ACORN ) . "
Rollings said the foundation tried to fund the schools directly , but doing so proved to be a " bureaucratic nightmare . "
But any external group that received money had to have created a program in partnership with a network of public schools .
And though ACORN is considered a liberal organization , the vast majority of the foundation 's external partners were not remotely controversial .
Here are a few examples : the Chicago Symphony , the University of Chicago , Loyola University , Northwestern University , the Chicago Children 's Museum , the Museum of Science and Industry , the Field Museum , the Commercial Club of Chicago , the Garfield Park Conservatory Alliance and the Logan Square Neighborhood Association .
Had Kurtz chosen to accuse Obama of carrying water for the conservative Annenberg , he might have written : " CAC disbursed money to various business - friendly entities , such as the Museum of Science and Industry and the Commercial Club of Chicago . "
See how easy it is ?
The programs the foundation funded were designed to allow individuals from the " external partners " – whether the musicians in the symphony or the business leaders in the commercial club – to help improve student achievement .
They were along the lines of mentoring by artists , literacy instruction , professional development for teachers and administrators , and training for parents in everything from computer skills to helping their children with homework to advocating for their children at school .
This last activity – something suburban parents practice with zeal – is also suspect in Kurtz 's view : " CAC records show that board member Arnold Weber was concerned that parents ' organized ' by community groups might be viewed by school principals 'as a political threat . ' "
That is typical of Kurtz 's essay – relatively innocuous facts cast in the worst possible light .
That 's appropriate for an opinion piece , perhaps , but hardly grounds for a purportedly factual political ad accusing the group of radicalism .
We could go on and on with evidence that the Chicago Annenberg Challenge was a rather vanilla charitable group .
For example , under the deal with Annenberg every dollar from him had to be matched by two from elsewhere .
The co-funders were a host of respected , mainstream institutions , such as the National Science Foundation , the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation , the W.K. Kellogg Foundation and the Chicago Public Schools .
In short , this was a mainstream foundation funded by a mainstream , Republican business leader and led by an overwhelmingly mainstream , civic - minded group of individuals .
Ayers ' involvement in its inception and on an advisory committee do not make it radical – nor does the funding of programs involving the United Nations and African - American studies .
This attack is false , but it 's more than that – it 's malicious .
It unfairly tars not just Obama , but all the other prominent , well - respected Chicagoans who also volunteered their time to the foundation .
They came from all walks of life and all political backgrounds , and there 's ample evidence their mission was nothing more than improving ailing public schools in Chicago .
Yet in the heat of a political campaign they have been accused of financing radicalism .
That 's Pants on Fire wrong .
Unlike in the United States , where deposits are fully guaranteed up to a limit of $ 250,000  a figure that was raised from $ 100,000 last week  deposits in most European countries have been only partially guaranteed , sometimes by groups of banks rather than governments .
In Germany , the first 90 percent of deposits up to 20,000 euros , or about $ 27,000 , was guaranteed .
The Paris meeting produced a promise that European leaders would work together to halt the financial crisis and reassure nervous investors , but even before the meeting began it was becoming clear that two bailouts announced the week before had not succeeded and that a major Italian bank might be in trouble .
That bank , Unicredit , announced plans on Sunday to raise as much as 6.6 billion euros , or $ 9 billion , in capital .
Fortis , which only a week ago received 11.2 billion euros from the governments of the Netherlands , Belgium and Luxembourg , was unable to continue its operations .
On Friday , the Dutch government seized its operations in that country , and Sunday night the Belgian government helped to arrange for BNP - Paribas , the French bank , to take over what was left of the company .
In Berlin , the government arranged a week ago for major banks to lend 35 billion euros to Hypo , but that fell apart when the banks concluded that more money would be needed .
Late Sunday , the government said a 50 billion euro package had been arranged , with the government and other banks participating .
The credit crisis began in the United States , a fact that has led European politicians to claim superiority for their country ’s financial systems , in contrast to what Silvio Berlusconi , Italy ’s prime minister , called the “ speculative capitalism ” of the United States .
On Saturday , Gordon Brown , the British prime minister , said the crisis “ has come from America , ” and Mr. Berlusconi bemoaned the lack of business ethics that had been exposed by the crisis .
Many of the European banks ’ problems have stemmed from bad loans in Europe , and Fortis got into trouble in part by borrowing money to make a major acquisition .
But activities in the United States have played a role .
Bankers said Sunday that the additional need for funds at Hypo came from newly discovered guarantees it had issued to back American municipal bonds that it had sold to investors .
The credit market worries came on top of heightening concerns about economic growth in Europe and the United States .
Many economists think there are recessions in both areas , and one also appears to have started in Japan , where the Nikkei newspaper reported Monday that a poll of corporate executives found that 94 percent thought the country ’s economy was deteriorating .
WASHINGTON - Rep. Peter DeFazio , D - Ore. , proposed a ``low cost , no cost '' approach Tuesday that he said would stabilize the nation 's wounded financial system and give Congress time to construct a more permanent solution that protects taxpayers and insulates banks , businesses and citizens from potential financial ruin .
DeFazio's approach pivots on several administrative and accounting changes that he and his allies say would stabilize the tottering financial system , make it easier for banks to make loans and restore confidence in the economy .
`` What I 'm proposing is to use both market discipline and regulatory functions at virtually no cost to taxpayers to unclog the arteries of commerce so banks can begin lending again , '' DeFazio said at a news conference flanked by six other Democrats .
`` The President has substantial powers to do that without legislation and it appears we may have to force him to use his power , '' said DeFazio , who added that several Republicans have expressed support for plan .
DeFazio said the individual pieces of his plan can be executed quickly and would have an almost immediate positive effect on the markets .
That would buy time for the administration and Congress to devise more thorough solution that fixes the economy 's underlying problems .
Among DeFazio's proposals :
-- Force the Securities and Exchange Commission to change the way mortgage securities are valued .
Current rules set the value too low because the 75 percent of good loans are not reflected in the market price , DeFazio said .
That creates ``a capital shortfall on paper .
The bill would require the SEC to alter rules so the strong loans could be priced separately .
-- Ban short selling of stocks .
This is the complicated and highly speculative practice of ``selling '' stock at a lower price before actually taking ownership .
``Such practices many times harm the companies represented in the sales and hurt their efforts to raise capital .
-- Increase the FDIC insurance limit on deposits from $ 100,000 per individual to $ 250,000 .
This idea earned broad support Tuesday , including positive response from the White and from presidential candidates Sens. Barack Obama and John McCain .
DeFazio , who has been a strident critic of the bi-partisan deal that would have provided Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson with $ 700 billion to buy bad mortgages and hopefully prevent financial institutions from failing , said the primary goal is to prevent a new version of that plan from moving forward .
Meanwhile , Rep. Greg Walden , R - Ore. , who voted for the bailout , said it will be difficult to push any bill through Congress .
``I think it gets tougher from here , frankly .
I do n't know which way it will go , '' he said in an interview .
`` Maybe the President just ends up cutting a deal with the Democrats figuring there are more votes to get there than on our side .
I think it 's a very difficult position right now .
I 'm not sure what other tweak you do in the bill that gets you the votes , '' he said .

Editor 's note : Campbell Brown anchors CNN's " Campbell Brown : Election Center " at 8 p.m. ET Mondays through Fridays .
She delivered this commentary during the " Cutting through the Bull " segment of Tuesday night 's broadcast .
Campbell Brown says she wants to hear more than , " We 'll cut pork barrel spending . "
NEW YORK ( CNN ) --
On the eve of the third and final debate , a plea to the presidential candidates :
Please do n't tell us that as president you are going to have to make some tough decisions .
Yes , you are .
We get that .
We know that .
We 're in the middle of a financial crisis that analysts keep telling us is unlike anything we 've been through as a country since the Great Depression .
Families are at this moment losing their savings , losing their homes , losing their jobs .
We understand that if elected president you are going to have to make some tough decisions .
That was Barack Obama 's answer at the first debate when he was asked what he would give up among all his proposals and promises , given the financial mess .
Watch Campell ask for specifics »
His response was about as nonspecific an answer as I have ever heard .
And he only gave that answer after he was asked the question by the moderator three times .
iReport.com :
What do you want to hear tonight ?
At the second debate , his answer was even less helpful .
He ignored the question entirely , again talking in vague generalities .
I assume Sen . Obama has a sense of the magnitude of the economic challenges we are facing , but those answers sound like they are coming from someone living in la-la land .
John McCain also tried to avoid the question at first and then fell back on a plan he had proposed in April , well before the financial crisis .
At the first debate it took three tries for Sen.
McCain to answer , finally repeating his call for a freeze on all discretionary spending with a few exceptions .
Whether you love or hate his idea , that is a separate debate , but compared to what we are getting from Obama , McCain at least has offered something concrete .
From both candidates , we need real answers .
And please do n't tell us that you are going to cut pork barrel spending and scrub the waste out of every bloated federal agency .
I mean , name a political candidate who has n't promised to cut the fat and eliminate waste in government .
Please , no bull .
Be straight with us , we can take it .
Americans understand the stakes .
Just give us brutal honesty , because so far we are not really getting it .
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer .
All About Barack Obama • John McCain • National Economy
The entrance to Skien high security prison in southern Norway is as foreboding as any that might be imagined .
The grey concrete walls are high and bleak – and appear even more austere against the backdrop of the blazing colours of the autumnal Norwegian forest close to which it has been built .
I have been invited to visit the prison by a teacher who works here .
Leif , a gently spoken bear of a man , has been in teaching for more than 20 years – it runs in his family he tells me .
" My father was a teacher , " he says , " and so was my grandfather . "
I step through the Judas gate at the side of the main gateway and immediately I feel the weight of confinement .
In the UK we call this part of a prison the " sterile area " - no prisoners allowed anywhere near it .
I follow Leif through other smaller steel gates as we make our way up a sloping , winding path that is bordered , perhaps a little incongruously , by flowerbeds and bright shrubs .
An eerie peace hangs over the buildings .
" The prisoners are all locked in their cells , " explains Leif , " but they will be going out on the exercise yard soon , perhaps you would like to join them ? "
It is an interesting suggestion , one I 'm not too sure about at first .
I remember my own time in prison and the discomfort that I and others felt when people from the outside came to " have a look around " .
It was fine if they engaged and interacted with us , recognising that we too were people .
But when that did n't happen there was a real sense of intrusion , of being gaped at , as if we were animals in a zoo .
Meanwhile Leif takes me to the staff canteen .
Prison guards are having a break , and a senior officer joins us , a broad - shouldered , tough looking man , with close - cropped hair and a clipped moustache .
Leif explains that the man is the officers ' union rep .
He appears a little suspicious of me at first , but soon relaxes and we chat amiably .
I tell him that in Britain we have a view that Scandinavian prisons are among the most progressive in Europe , " but what I 've seen so far reminds me very much of the high security prisons that I have experienced at home " .
He smiles .
" It 's a prison , " he says .
" You would know it if you were in here . "
Leif beckons me to follow him .
" Come , I show you where I work , " he says .
I follow and soon we are in what I recognise as the education department .
It is very clean .
He shows me a classroom .
There are rows of wooden desks and chairs , like any classroom , except each desk has a computer on it .
" Every prisoner here has a computer in the classroom , " he says , " and a computer in their cell . "
The last bit especially surprises me .
In the UK prisoner access to computers is strictly limited .
Most education departments have a computer room – but only a dozen or so prisoners will ever be able to use them at any one time , bearing in mind that only 10 - 30 % of any UK prisoner population has regular access to the prison education department .
Leif tells me that there are 80 prisoners in Skien .
In the whole of Norway there are just over 3,000 prisoners , out of the country 's population of around 4 m .
" I do n't suppose the prisoners have access to the internet , " I say .
Leif looks at me .
" But of course , " he says .
And in their cells ?
" Yes . "
Leif explains that firewalls have been set up to ensure security is maintained .
" But they must be able to access the internet , " he says , " to help in their education and also so that they know they are still connected to the world . "
It seems a noble and generous attitude compared to that in the UK .
Few governors are prepared to allow prisoners have computers in their cells – and none allow Internet access for prisoners .
" Come , " says Leif , " I 'll show you the workshops . "
First we go to the woodworking shed .
The machines are big and look complicated .
" We train in all aspects of carpentry , " he says .
Then tells me that a prisoner manufactured all the desks , tables and benches that we have just seen in the classrooms in this workshop .
" He is very proud of his work , and we are proud of what he has achieved , " says Leif .
Other examples of items being made by the prisoners are in various states of completion around the large airy room .
" We want them to go back out into the community with skills , " says Leif .
He then takes me to the metal workshop where the same level of hi-tech machinery is evident .
Finally he takes me out on to the exercise yard where the prisoners are walking and jogging around in circles .
They see us arrive and a number come over to meet us .
They are surprised when I tell them I was in prison for 20 years and now work as a writer .
We chat about how they are serving their time .
Ali , a former Kurdish guerrilla soldier , introduces himself .
He says nice things about Leif .
" He is good man , " he says , " they help us here . "
Ali is studying for a law degree , which he intends to use to help his people when he returns to his home country after he is released .
" But it is hard to keep motivated , " he says .
" Prison is difficult . "
Even with the enlightened attitudes and abundance of facilities this place is still a prison .
And it is not meant to be " easy " .
But at least here the prisoners are treated like men and provided with a constructive and meaningful regime .
The differences between this and the impoverished UK system loom large .
I shake Ali's hand and we seem to connect in some way .
" Just do n't give up , " I say .
I thank all the prisoners for their time and wish them well on their journeys , and then I leave without turning to look back .
I am aware of the huge privilege I now enjoy , of being able to enter a prison and walk out again the same day .
Later I reflect on how far we have to go in the UK to even come close to matching the attitudes towards people in prison that I witnessed in Norway .
From expressing gratitude to offering flexible notice , experts give their top advice to budding entrepreneurs leaving their full - time jobs .

Working a 9 - to - 5 but planning your escape for the entrepreneurial life ?
You ’re not alone .
Many aspiring business owners start their careers at day jobs , while simultaneously building their business in their free time .
If you feel you ’re ready to pursue your side hustle full - time , you might be wondering how to break it to your current employer .
We asked entrepreneurs who have been there for their best tips to help you quit your job — the right way .
Do n't burn bridges
It might be tempting to cut all ties with your boss and colleagues , but doing so could be detrimental to your career .
“ Although oftentimes we think of quitting as telling off everyone , it 's important to actually stay positive and on good terms with your soon - to - be - former boss , ” said Simon Nowak , CEO of 3 Credit Scores .
“ You never know how things will turn out , and leaving them as a potential reference and a place to maybe return if necessary is always a good idea . ”
Even if you harbor some sort of resentment toward your old boss , you ’ll want to remain as cordial and professional as possible in your exit .
You never know when your connections with your prior employer might come in handy .

Thank your boss for all of the support , guidance and opportunities to learn that have come your way .
Holly Knoll , business coach and creator of The Consultant Code
Express gratitude
When an employee decides to quit their job , they often dwell on the negatives they faced while working there .
Instead , focus on the benefits you ’ve reaped from your employment .
“ Whether you liked the job or not , you did have a job and that likely made your life at least a little easier , ” said Nowak .
“ Saying a quick thank you will spread a little good will around . ”
Start your conversation by expressing how appreciative you are of the company and all they ’ve done for you .
Beginning on a positive note will lessen the blow you ’re about to deliver .
“ Thank your boss for all of the support , guidance and opportunities to learn that have come your way , ” said Holly Knoll , business coach and creator of The Consultant Code .
“ Express appreciation … for your experience working under their leadership . ”
Set boundaries
So , you ’re quitting your job for a chance at entrepreneurship — but your boss does n’t have to know that .
“ When you 're leaving your full - time job to pursue your own business ... you do n't actually have to tell your boss why you 're leaving , ” said Kathryn Roberts , owner of coaching business Quest for $ 47 .
When Roberts left her full - time position to focus on growing her business , she declined to disclose the details of her departure with her boss , despite his inquiries .
“ When it comes to leaving any job , making that conversation as short and as painless as possible should be your priority , and most of that will depend on your relationship with your direct supervisor , ” said Roberts .
“ If you 're comfortable with going into the details , go right ahead , but if you 're not , know that you do n't have to . ”
Be flexible
If you want to stay on good terms with your soon - to - be - former employer , give them as much notice as possible and be mindful of how your departure might affect them .
“ Because you are leaving to do your own thing , chances are you can be a bit more flexible [ than ] the standard two - weeks - notice period , ” said Knoll .
“ Perhaps give your boss a little more room to find a replacement and work with them on exit timing that does n't leave them completely in the lurch . ”
Document your daily responsibilities and be open to training others to do your job , so you ’re not leaving your company empty - handed .
Additionally , if you find you have extra time to answer questions or offer advice once your notice is up , consider lending a helping hand here and there .
“ After your departure , offer to be available via phone or email ( you set the boundaries ) for questions the team may have , ” said Knoll .
“ If it makes sense for you , you could even offer your services to be a paid advisor or consultant on an as - needed basis . ”

Deadly assaults in federal penitentiaries are on the rise and they are n’t exclusive to Colorado .
Following reports that an inmate was stabbed to death in August at the U.S. Penitentiary in the southern city of Florence , there is news from another federal lockup that a guard was assaulted and stabbed multiple times this month , lending credence to correctional workers ’ claims that the entire system is an understaffed tinderbox .
The Bureau of Prisons , the agency overseeing the lockups , has confirmed that a correctional guard was stabbed by an inmate multiple times in the head and lower back at the U.S. Penitentiary Big Sandy in Kentucky , sustaining injuries that required medical attention .
Workers at the facility claim that the guard was stabbed with a makeshift “ shank ” weapon , but the bureau has not yet confirmed that detail .
Bureau officials state that the guard was released from hospital care on Oct. 21 , the same day the assault happened .
The prison has been on lockdown status since the incident , which means that inmates are generally confined to their cells and not allowed to visit with family members .
Bureau employees familiar with the situation , who commented on an anonymous basis , stated that the guard was “ stabbed five times with the weapon ” and sustained “ 3 - inch stab wounds to the head area and three stab wounds to the lung and back area , ” by an “ inmate refusing to be restrained , due to being intoxicated ” and that the “ officer had blood streaming from the head wounds . ”
So far , the bureau has not confirmed the workers ’ claims .
The fact that the inmate was able to hide a weapon in the first place , coupled with the bellicose assault on a staff member , are indications that understaffing has created a dangerous environment for both guards and inmates in the federal prison .
In Colorado , at the high - security penitentiary in Florence , three inmates have died in less than four months .
Two prisoners were killed by guard gunfire when a massive 200 - person riot broke out on the recreation yard of the prison in April after inmates were again allegedly intoxicated on self - brewed alcohol .
Another inmate was killed in August in what workers say was a stabbing by another inmate .
The prison has been on lockdown since the most recent killing .
Colorado Sen. Ken Salazar , a Democrat , sent a letter to bureau head Harley Lappin in September demanding that the agency publicly disclose the results of an investigation into the riot .
However , the bureau has not yet responded to the lawmaker .
It ’s not the first letter that has been sent to the bureau , either .
In February Rep. Alan Mollohan , D - W.Va. , sent a brief memo to Lappin , commenting on increasing violence against correctional workers in the nation ’s prisons :
I am concerned about reports of increasing violence in the Federal Prison System , including recent assaults and homicides at [ U.S. Penitentiary ] Hazelton , [ U.S. Penitentiary ] Beaumont and [ Federal Correctional Institution ]
Allenwood .
Incidents such as these are particularly troubling given the funding limitations in the Bureau of Prisons in fiscal year 2008 , and the impact such constraints may have on the Bureau ’s ability to respond to violent threats and attacks .
The violence reached a pinnacle in June when José Rivera , a 22 - year - old correctional worker , was stabbed to death by an inmate at the U.S. Penitentiary Atwater in California .
Inmate - on - inmate assaults are also on the rise .
According to federal data and media reports , 12 inmates in federal prisons lost their lives due to inmate - on - inmate violence in 2007 , and the number has already reached at least 11 in 2008 .
Correctional workers have been blowing whistles for years over what they claim are dangerously low staffing levels at government lockups .
Employees claim that the low number of guards has made it increasingly difficult to spot contraband like alcohol and weapons .
In March 2005 , the bureau implemented a directive called “ mission critical , ” that ordered all agency institutions to come up with staffing rosters that listed the bare - minimum needed to run each prison safely .
Workers contend that the bureau is n’t even fulfilling obligations for the bare - minimum and is vacating units for hours at a time .
Clarification : Story edited to further distinguish claims made from the bureau and workers at the Big Sandy USP relating to statements about a makeshift “ shank ” weapon .

Scandal is our growth industry .
Revelation of wrongdoing leads not to definitive investigation , punishment , and expiation but to more scandal .
Permanent scandal .
Frozen scandal .
The weapons of mass destruction that turned out not to exist .
The torture of detainees who remain forever detained .
The firing of prosecutors which is forever investigated .
These and other frozen scandals metastasize , ramify , self - replicate , clogging the cable news shows and the blogosphere and the bookstores .
The titillating story that never ends , the pundit gabfest that never ceases , the gift that never stops giving : what is indestructible , irresolvable , unexpiatable is too valuable not to be made into a source of profit .
Scandal , unpurged and unresolved , transcends political reality to become commercial fact .
We remember , many of us , a different time .
However cynically we look to our political past , it is there that we find our political Eden : Vietnam and its domestic denouement , Watergate — the climax of a different time of scandal that ended a war and brought down a president .
In retrospect those events unfold with the clear logic of utopian dream .
First , revelation : intrepid journalists exposing the gaudy , interlocking crimes of the Nixon administration .
Then , investigation : not just by the press — for that was but precursor , the necessary condition — but by Congress and the courts .
Investigation , that is , by the polity , working through its institutions to construct a story of grim truth that citizens can in common accept .
And finally expiation : the handing down of sentences , the politicians in shackles led off to jail , the orgy of public repentance .
The exorcism of shame , the purging of the political system , and the return to a state , however imperfect , of societal grace .
It is a myth , of course , but a lovely one .
It relies on images of power , the press , and the people that fit our collective longing — for justice , for heroism , and for ultimate goodness residing in a people who , once alerted to wrongdoing , insist on its rectification .
The obstacle to this natural self - cleansing of our political life can only be the people ’s ignorance .
For if they know , and the corruption and scandals persist — well , how can the people be good ?
No , what must be missing then — so the myth implies — is clarity , revelation .
What is missing is the gatekeepers of our ignorance whose duty it is to draw the curtain back from scandal and show the people everything , thereby starting the polity on the road to inexorable justice .
Information is all .
Information , together with the people ’s natural sense of the good and the right , leads to expiation and society ’s inevitable cleansing .
However tenaciously the mythmakers of our society — and especially journalists , who are after all the stars of this idealized drama — cling to this happy scenario , recent history has not been kind to it .
For it rests on an image of journalists and journalism that has become , to put it charitably , outdated .
Journalists as the self - abnegating seekers after truth , …
It was an act of defiance typical of the last man still alive in the UK to have served in both world wars .
Just weeks ago Bill Stone was lying in a hospital bed with a virulent infection .
He astounded doctors by recovering in time to return to the residential home where he lives to celebrate his 108th birthday .
Today , health permitting , he will proudly join other veterans again in the annual remembrance ceremony .
Mr Stone was born the 10th of 14 children in Kingsbridge , Devon , at the turn of the last century .
Yet he was still rattling a tin for the Royal British Legion Poppy Appeal as recently as five years ago .
There is not a royal he has not met , not a grand monument he has not been photographed in front of , nor a remembrance ceremony where he has not been centre stage .
Speaking in recent years Mr Stone , who now lives in a residential home near Wokingham , Berkshire , said : " I 've had a wonderful life . "
" I 've always worked hard , never stopped for a minute and it's kept me going all right . "
That energy has taken Mr Stone all over the world , to Cape Town , Tasmania , Jakarta , Newfoundland , Buenos Aires and Malta ; it has seen him work as barrow boy , steam engine driver , barber , tobacconist and farm hand .
Mr Stone experienced first - hand the horrors of the 1918 Spanish Influenza pandemic and cut the hair of General Franco 's brother on rescuing him from a stricken plane .
He witnessed South Africa 's apartheid , grieved with a nation at the sinking of the Titanic in 1912 , and danced in the streets at the end of the Great War ( 1914 - 1918 ) .
Mr Stone was called up just six weeks before the Allies won that conflict but encountered the horrors of naked , scrambling soldiers who he picked up at the evacuation of Dunkirk in 1940 during the next world war .
He remembers the majestic ships he served on which now lie in watery graves and the men he drank beer with who fell prey to German bombers .
" War is terrible , " he said .
" I saw Plymouth flattened and at the end of the war I went to Germany and all their buildings were flattened too .
" We were guarding an island there but there was no trouble because the Germans were as glad as we were that it was all over .
They did n't want war just as we did n't . "
Mr Stone joined the Royal Navy in Plymouth as a stoker at 18 after an initial attempt - thwarted by his father who refused to sign his papers - to follow his brothers and sign up at 15 .
Within the year he had joined the battlecruiser HMS Tiger , which took him to Scapa Flow , the home of the navy 's Grand Fleet , before progressing to the battleship HMS Hood in 1922 to travel around the world " showing the flag " to the colonies .
It was during this time that Mr Stone developed the hair - cutting skills that would make him a popular member of the ship .
" The man before me could n't cut butter but I got so good the officers used to send for me , " he said .
" They 'd ask how much they owed me and I 'd say : ' If it 's all the same to you , sir , I 'll have a beer " ' .
He was destined for greater things , moving in quick succession from leading to chief stoker and on to HMS Chrysanthemum , HMS P40 , HMS Eagle , HMS Harebell , HMS Thanet , HMS Tenedos and HMS Carlisle .
During the Second World War , he made five trips to the beaches of Dunkirk on board HMS Salamander , went minesweeping to Arkhangel on Russia 's northern coast and supported the Allied landing in Sicily in 1943 .
In 1938 he married Lily , a girl from his village , and the following year their daughter Anne was born , just months before the outbreak of the Second World War .
Lily died in 1995 .
Mr Stone and the other seven brothers and uncles in his family amazingly emerged unscathed from both wars , despite many near misses .
After he had moved on from HMS Hood she was blown up in a duel with the German battleship Bismarck in 1941 , with the loss of 1,416 lives .
And Salamander was mistaken for the enemy and attacked by RAF planes .
During the Dunkirk evacuation a ship 50 yards from Mr Stone 's vessel was sunk with 100 sailors and 200 soldiers on board .
Shortly afterwards a torpedo skimmed the bows of his own ship .
Later , another ship he was on would have its rudder blown off and limp over to Boston using a sail made of quarterdeck awnings .
" I always say ' God help us ' , " he said .
" I have said it many times and it has always helped tremendously .
I 've been very lucky . "
In September , Mr Stone collapsed with an infection and was rushed to the Royal Berkshire Hospital in Reading .
But he proved he is still a fighter by spending two weeks there recovering before being released in time to celebrate his 108th birthday .

In all democratic countries , in the United States even more than elsewhere , a strong belief prevails that the influence of the intellectuals on politics is negligible .
This is no doubt true of the power of intellectuals to make their peculiar opinions of the moment influence decisions , of the extent to which they can sway the popular vote on questions on which they differ from the current views of the masses .
Yet over somewhat longer periods they have probably never exercised so great an influence as they do today in those countries .
This power they wield by shaping public opinion .
In the light of recent history it is somewhat curious that this decisive power of the professional secondhand dealers in ideas should not yet be more generally recognized .
The political development of the Western world during the last hundred years furnishes the clearest demonstration .
Socialism has never and nowhere been at first a working - class movement .
It is by no means an obvious remedy for the obvious evil which the interests of that class will necessarily demand .
It is a construction of theorists , deriving from certain tendencies of abstract thought with which , for a long time , only the intellectuals were familiar ; and it required long efforts by the intellectuals before the working classes could be persuaded to adopt it as their program .
In every country that has moved toward socialism , the phase of the development in which socialism becomes a determining influence on politics has been preceded for many years by a period during which socialist ideals governed the thinking of the more active intellectuals .
In Germany this stage had been reached toward the end of the last century ; in England and France , about the time of the First World War .
To the casual observer it would seem as if the United States had reached this phase after World War II and that the attraction of a planned and directed economic system is now as strong among the American intellectuals as it ever was among their German or English fellows .
Experience suggests that , once this phase has been reached , it is merely a question of time until the views now held by the intellectuals become the governing force of politics .
The character of the process by which the views of the intellectuals influence the politics of tomorrow is therefore of much more than academic interest .
Whether we merely wish to foresee or attempt to influence the course of events , it is a factor of much greater importance than is generally understood .
What to the contemporary observer appears as the battle of conflicting interests has indeed often been decided long before in a clash of ideas confined to narrow circles .
Paradoxically enough , however , in general only the parties of the Left have done most to spread the belief that it was the numerical strength of the opposing material interests which decided political issues , whereas in practice these same parties have regularly and successfully acted as if they understood the key position of the intellectuals .
Whether by design or driven by the force of circumstances , they have always directed their main effort toward gaining the support of this " elite , " while the more conservative groups have acted , as regularly but unsuccessfully , on a more naive view of mass democracy and have usually vainly tried directly to reach and to persuade the individual voter .
The term " intellectuals , " however , does not at once convey a true picture of the large class to which we refer , and the fact that we have no better name by which to describe what we have called the secondhand dealers in ideas is not the least of the reasons why their power is not understood .
Even persons who use the word " intellectual " mainly as a term of abuse are still inclined to withhold it from many who undoubtedly perform that characteristic function .
This is neither that of the original thinker nor that of the scholar or expert in a particular field of thought .
The typical intellectual need be neither : he need not possess special knowledge of anything in particular , nor need he even be particularly intelligent , to perform his role as intermediary in the spreading of ideas .
What qualifies him for his job is the wide range of subjects on which he can readily talk and write , and a position or habits through which he becomes acquainted with new ideas sooner than those to whom he addresses himself .
Until one begins to list all the professions and activities which belong to the class , it is difficult to realize how numerous it is , how the scope for activities constantly increases in modern society , and how dependent on it we all have become .
The class does not consist of only journalists , teachers , ministers , lecturers , publicists , radio commentators , writers of fiction , cartoonists , and artists all of whom may be masters of the technique of conveying ideas but are usually amateurs so far as the substance of what they convey is concerned .
The class also includes many professional men and technicians , such as scientists and doctors , who through their habitual intercourse with the printed word become carriers of new ideas outside their own fields and who , because of their expert knowledge of their own subjects , are listened with respect on most others .
There is little that the ordinary man of today learns about events or ideas except through the medium of this class ; and outside our special fields of work we are in this respect almost all ordinary men , dependent for our information and instruction on those who make it their job to keep abreast of opinion .
It is the intellectuals in this sense who decide what views and opinions are to reach us , which facts are important enough to be told to us , and in what form and from what angle they are to be presented .
Whether we shall ever learn of the results of the work of the expert and the original thinker depends mainly on their decision .
The layman , perhaps , is not fully aware to what extent even the popular reputations of scientists and scholars are made by that class and are inevitably affected by its views on subjects which have little to do with the merits of the real achievements .
And it is specially significant for our problem that every scholar can probably name several instances from his field of men who have undeservedly achieved a popular reputation as great scientists solely because they hold what the intellectuals regard as " progressive " political views ; but I have yet to come across a single instance where such a scientific pseudo - reputation has been bestowed for political reason on a scholar of more conservative leanings .
This creation of reputations by the intellectuals is particularly important in the fields where the results of expert studies are not used by other specialists but depend on the political decision of the public at large .
There is indeed scarcely a better illustration of this than the attitude which professional economists have taken to the growth of such doctrines as socialism or protectionism .
There was probably at no time a majority of economists , who were recognized as such by their peers , favorable to socialism ( or , for that matter , to protection ) .
In all probability it is even true to say that no other similar group of students contains so high a proportion of its members decidedly opposed to socialism ( or protection ) .
This is the more significant as , in recent times , it is as likely as not that it was an early interest in socialist schemes for reform which led a man to choose economics for his profession .
Yet it is not the predominant views of the experts but the views of a minority , mostly of rather doubtful standing in their profession , which are taken up and spread by the intellectuals .
The all - pervasive influence of the intellectuals in contemporary society is still further strengthened by the growing importance of " organization . "
It is a common but probably mistaken belief that the increase of organization increases the influence of the expert or specialist .
This may be true of the expert administrator and organizer , if there are such people , but hardly of the expert in any particular field of knowledge .
It is rather the person whose general knowledge is supposed to qualify him to appreciate expert testimony , and to judge between the experts from different fields , whose power is enhanced .
The point which is important for us , however , is that the scholar who becomes a university president , the scientist who takes charge of an institute or foundation , the scholar who becomes an editor or the active promoter of an organization serving a particular cause , all rapidly cease to be scholars or experts and become intellectuals , solely in the light of certain fashionable general ideas .
The number of such institutions which breed intellectuals and increase their number and powers grows every day .
Almost all the " experts " in the mere technique of getting knowledge over are , with respect to the subject matter which they handle , intellectuals and not experts .
In the sense in which we are using the term , the intellectuals are in fact a fairly new phenomenon of history .
Though nobody will regret that education has ceased to be a privilege of the propertied classes , the fact that the propertied classes are no longer the best educated , and the fact that the large number of people who owe their position solely to the their general education do not possess that experience of the working of the economic system which the administration of property gives , are important for understanding the role of the intellectual .
Professor Schumpeter , who has devoted an illuminating chapter of his Capitalism , Socialism , and Democracy to some aspects of our problem , has not unfairly stressed that it is the absence of direct responsibility for practical affairs and the consequent absence of first - hand knowledge of them which distinguishes the typical intellectual from other people who also wield the power of the spoken and written word .
It would lead too far , however , to examine here further the development of this class and the curious claim which has recently been advanced by one of its theorists that it was the only one whose views were not decidedly influenced by its own economic interests .
One of the important points that would have to be examined in such a discussion would be how far the growth of this class has been artificially stimulated by the law of copyright .
It is not surprising that the real scholar or expert and the practical man of affairs often feel contemptuous about the intellectual , are disinclined to recognize his power , and are resentful when they discover it .
Individually they find the intellectuals mostly to be people who understand nothing in particular especially well and whose judgment on matters they themselves understand shows little sign of special wisdom .
But it would be a fatal mistake to underestimate their power for this reason .
Even though their knowledge may often be superficial and their intelligence limited , this does not alter the fact that it is their judgment which mainly determines the views on which society will act in the not too distant future .
It is no exaggeration to say that , once the more active part of the intellectuals has been converted to a set of beliefs , the process by which these become generally accepted is almost automatic and irresistible .
These intellectuals are the organs which modern society has developed for spreading knowledge and ideas , and it is their convictions and opinions which operate as the sieve through which all new conceptions must pass before they can reach the masses .
It is of the nature of the intellectual 's job that he must use his own knowledge and convictions in performing his daily task .
He occupies his position because he possesses , or has had to deal from day to day with , knowledge which his employer in general does not possess , and his activities can therefore be directed by others only to a limited extent .
And just because the intellectuals are mostly intellectually honest , it is inevitable that they should follow their own conviction whenever they have discretion and that they should give a corresponding slant to everything that passes through their hands .
Even where the direction of policy is in the hands of men of affairs of different views , the execution of policy will in general be in the hands of intellectuals , and it is frequently the decision on the detail which determines the net effect .
We find this illustrated in almost all fields of contemporary society .
Newspapers in " capitalist " ownership , universities presided over by " reactionary " governing bodies , broadcasting systems owned by conservative governments , have all been known to influence public opinion in the direction of socialism , because this was the conviction of the personnel .
This has often happened not only in spite of , but perhaps even because of , the attempts of those at the top to control opinion and to impose principles of orthodoxy .
The effect of this filtering of ideas through the convictions of a class which is constitutionally disposed to certain views is by no means confined to the masses .
Outside his special field the expert is generally no less dependent on this class and scarcely less influenced by their selection .
The result of this is that today , in most parts of the Western world , even the most determined opponents of socialism derive from socialist sources their knowledge on most subjects on which they have no firsthand information .
With many of the more general preconceptions of socialist thought , the connection of their more practical proposals is by no means at once obvious ; in consequence of that system of thought become in fact effective spreaders of its ideas .
Who does not know the practical man who in his own field denounces socialism as " pernicious rot " but , when he steps outside his subject , spouts socialism like any left journalist ?
In no other field has the predominant influence of the socialist intellectuals been felt more strongly during the last hundred years than in the contacts between different national civilizations .
It would go far beyond the limits of this article to trace the causes and significance of the highly important fact that , in the modern world , the intellectuals provide almost the only approach to an international community .
It is this which mainly accounts for the extraordinary spectacle that for generations the supposedly " capitalist "
West has been lending its moral and material support almost exclusively to those ideological movements in countries farther east which aimed at undermining Western civilization and that , at the same time , the information which the western public has obtained about events in Central and Eastern Europe has almost inevitably been colored by a socialist bias .
Many of the " educational " activities of the American forces of occupation of Germany have furnished clear and recent examples of this tendency .
A proper understanding of the reasons which tend to incline so many of the intellectuals toward socialism is thus most important .
The first point here , which those who do not share this bias ought to face frankly , is that it is neither selfish interests nor evil intentions but mostly honest convictions and good intentions which determine the intellectual 's views .
In fact , it is necessary to recognize that , on the whole , the typical intellectual is today more likely to be a socialist the more he is guided by good will and intelligence , and that on the plane of purely intellectual argument he will generally be able to make out a better case than the majority of his opponents within his class .
If we still think him wrong , we must recognize that it may be genuine error which leads the well - meaning and intelligent people who occupy those key positions in our society to spread views which to us appear a threat to our civilization .
Nothing could be more important than to try to understand the sources of this error in order that we should be able to counter it .
Yet those who are generally regarded as the representatives of the existing order and who believe that they comprehend the dangers of socialism are usually very far from such understanding .
They tend to regard the socialist intellectuals as nothing more than a pernicious bunch of highbrow radicals without appreciating their influence and , by their whole attitude to them , tend to drive them even further into opposition to the existing order .
If we are to understand this peculiar bias of a large section of intellectuals , we must be clear about two points .
The first is that they generally judge all particular issues exclusively in the light of certain general ideas ; the second , that the characteristic errors of any age are frequently derived from some genuine new truths it has discovered , and they are erroneous applications of new generalizations which have proved their value in other fields .
The conclusion to which we shall be led by a full consideration of these facts will be that the effective refutation of such errors will frequently require further intellectual advance , and often advance on points which are very abstract and may seem very remote from the practical issues .
It is perhaps the most characteristic feature of the intellectual that he judges new ideas not by their specific merits but by the readiness with which they fit into his general conceptions , into the picture of the world which he regards as modern or advanced .
It is through their influence on him and on his choice of opinions on particular issues that the power of ideas for good and evil grows in proportion to their generality , abstractness , and even vagueness .
As he knows little about the particular issues , his criterion must be consistency with his other views and suitability for combining into a coherent picture of the world .
Yet this selection from the multitude of new ideas presenting themselves at every moment creates the characteristic climate of opinion , the dominant Weltanschauung of a period , which will be favorable to the reception of some opinions and unfavorable to others and which will make the intellectual readily accept one conclusion and reject another without a real understanding of the issues .
In some respects the intellectual is indeed closer to the philosopher than to any specialist , and the philosopher is in more than one sense a sort of prince among the intellectuals .
Although his influence is farther removed from practical affairs and correspondingly slower and more difficult to trace than that of the ordinary intellectual , it is of the same kind and in the long run even more powerful than that of the latter .
It is the same endeavor toward a synthesis , pursued more methodically , the same judgment of particular views in so far as they fit into a general system of thought rather than by their specific merits , the same striving after a consistent worldview , which for both forms the main basis for accepting or rejecting ideas .
For this reason the philosopher has probably a greater influence over the intellectuals than any other scholar or scientist and , more than anyone else , determines the manner in which the intellectuals exercise their censorship function .
The popular influence of the scientific specialist begins to rival that of the philosopher only when he ceases to be a specialist and commences to philosophize about the progress of his subject , and usually only after he has been taken up by the intellectuals for reasons which have little to do with his scientific eminence .
The " climate of opinion " of any period is thus essentially a set of very general preconceptions by which the intellectual judges the importance of new facts and opinions .
These preconceptions are mainly applications to what seem to him the most significant aspects of scientific achievements , a transfer to other fields of what has particularly impressed him in the work of the specialists .
One could give a long list of such intellectual fashions and catchwords which , in the course of two or three generations , have in turn dominated the thinking of the intellectuals .
Whether it was the " historical approach " or the theory of evolution , 19th - century determinism and the belief in the predominant influence of environment as against heredity , the theory of relativity or the belief in the power of the unconscious — every one of these general conceptions has been made the touchstone by which innovations in different fields have been tested .
It seems as if the less specific or precise ( or the less understood ) these ideas are , the wider may be their influence .
Sometimes it is no more than a vague impression rarely put into words which thus wields a profound influence .
Such beliefs as that deliberate control or conscious organization is also , in social affairs , always superior to the results of spontaneous processes which are not directed by a human mind , or that any order based on a plan laid down beforehand must be better than one formed by the balancing of opposing forces , have in this way profoundly affected political development .
Only apparently different is the role of the intellectuals where the development of more properly social ideas is concerned .
Here their peculiar propensities manifest themselves in making shibboleths of abstractions , in rationalizing and carrying to extremes certain ambitions which spring from the normal intercourse of men .
Since democracy is a good thing , the further the democratic principle can be carried , the better it appears to them .
The most powerful of these general ideas which have shaped political development in recent times is of course the ideal of material equality .
It is , characteristically , not one of the spontaneously grown moral convictions , first applied in the relations between particular individuals , but an intellectual construction originally conceived in the abstract and of doubtful meaning or application in particular instances .
Nevertheless , it has operated strongly as a principle of selection among the alternative courses of social policy , exercising a persistent pressure toward an arrangement of social affairs which nobody clearly conceives .
That a particular measure tends to bring about greater equality has come to be regarded as so strong a recommendation that little else will be considered .
Since on each particular issue it is this one aspect on which those who guide opinion have a definite conviction , equality has determined social change even more strongly than its advocates intended .
Not only moral ideals act in this manner , however .
Sometimes the attitudes of the intellectuals toward the problems of social order may be the consequence of advances in purely scientific knowledge , and it is in these instances that their erroneous views on particular issues may , for a time , seem to have all the prestige of the latest scientific achievements behind them .
It is not in itself surprising that a genuine advance of knowledge should , in this manner , become on occasion a source of new error .
If no false conclusions followed from new generalizations , they would be final truths which would never need revision .
Although as a rule such a new generalization will merely share the false consequences which can be drawn from it with the views which were held before , and thus not lead to new error , it is quite likely that a new theory , just as its value is shown by the valid new conclusions to which it leads , will produce other new conclusions to which further advance will show to have been erroneous .
But in such an instance a false belief will appear with all the prestige of the latest scientific knowledge supporting it .
Although in the particular field to which this belief applies all the scientific evidence may be against it , it will nevertheless , before the tribunal of the intellectuals and in the light of the ideas which govern their thinking , be selected as the view which is best in accord with the spirit of the time .
The specialists who will thus achieve public fame and wide influence will thus not be those who have gained recognition by their peers but will often be men whom the other experts regard as cranks , amateurs , or even frauds , but who in the eyes of the general public nevertheless become the best - known exponents of their subject .
In particular , there can be little doubt that the manner in which , during the last hundred years , man has learned to organize the forces of nature has contributed a great deal toward the creation of the belief that a similar control of the forces of society would bring comparable improvements in human conditions .
That , with the application of engineering techniques , the direction of all forms of human activity according to a single coherent plan should prove to be as successful in society as it has been in innumerable engineering tasks , is too plausible a conclusion not to seduce most of those who are elated by the achievement of the natural sciences .
It must indeed be admitted both that it would require powerful arguments to counter the strong presumption in favor of such a conclusion and that these arguments have not yet been adequately stated .
It is not sufficient to point out the defects of particular proposals based on this kind of reasoning .
The argument will not lose its force until it has been conclusively shown why what has proved so eminently successful in producing advances in so many fields should have limits to its usefulness and become positively harmful if extended beyond these limits .
This is a task which has not yet been satisfactorily performed and which will have to be achieved before this particular impulse toward socialism can be removed .
This , of course , is only one of many instances where further intellectual advance is needed if the harmful ideas at present current are to be refuted and where the course which we shall travel will ultimately be decided by the discussion of very abstract issues .
It is not enough for the man of affairs to be sure , from his intimate knowledge of a particular field , that the theories of socialism which are derived from more general ideas will prove impracticable .
He may be perfectly right , and yet his resistance will be overwhelmed and all the sorry consequences which he foresees will follow if he is not supported by an effective refutation of the idées mères .
So long as the intellectual gets the better of the general argument , the most valid objections of the specific issue will be brushed aside .
This is not the whole story , however .
The forces which influence recruitment to the ranks of the intellectuals operate in the same direction and help to explain why so many of the most able among them lean toward socialism .
There are of course as many differences of opinion among intellectuals as among other groups of people ; but it seems to be true that it is on the whole the more active , intelligent , and original men among the intellectuals who most frequently incline toward socialism , while its opponents are often of an inferior caliber .
This is true particularly during the early stages of the infiltration of socialist ideas ; later , although outside intellectual circles it may still be an act of courage to profess socialist convictions , the pressure of opinion among intellectuals will often be so strongly in favor of socialism that it requires more strength and independence for a man to resist it than to join in what his fellows regard as modern views .
Nobody , for instance , who is familiar with large numbers of university faculties ( and from this point of view , the majority of university teachers probably have to be classed as intellectuals rather than as experts ) can remain oblivious to the fact that the most brilliant and successful teachers are today more likely than not to be socialists , while those who hold more conservative political views are as frequently mediocrities .
This is of course by itself an important factor leading the younger generation into the socialist camp .
The socialist will , of course , see in this merely a proof that the more intelligent person is today bound to become a socialist .
But this is far from being the necessary or even the most likely explanation .
The main reason for this state of affairs is probably that , for the exceptionally able man who accepts the present order of society , a multitude of other avenues to influence and power are open , while to the disaffected and dissatisfied an intellectual career is the most promising path to both influence and the power to contribute to the achievement of his ideals .
Even more than that : the more conservatively inclined man of first - class ability will in general choose intellectual work ( and the sacrifice in material reward which this choice usually entails ) only if he enjoys it for its own sake .
He is , in consequence , more likely to become an expert scholar rather than an intellectual in the specific sense of the word ; while to the more radically minded , the intellectual pursuit is more often than not a means rather than an end , a path to exactly that kind of wide influence which the professional intellectual exercises .
It is therefore probably the fact , not that the more intelligent people are generally socialists , but that a much higher proportion of socialists among the best minds devote themselves to those intellectual pursuits which in modern society give them a decisive influence on public opinion .
The selection of the personnel of the intellectuals is also closely connected with the predominant interest which they show in general and abstract ideas .
Speculations about the possible entire reconstruction of society give the intellectual a fare much more to his taste than the more practical and short - run considerations of those who aim at a piecemeal improvement of the existing order .
In particular , socialist thought owes its appeal to the young largely to its visionary character ; the very courage to indulge in utopian thought is in this respect a source of strength to the socialists which traditional liberalism sadly lacks .
This difference operates in favor of socialism , not only because speculation about general principles provides an opportunity for the play of the imagination of those who are unencumbered by much knowledge of the facts of present - day life , but also because it satisfies a legitimate desire for the understanding of the rational basis of any social order and gives scope for the exercise of that constructive urge for which liberalism , after it had won its great victories , left few outlets .
The intellectual , by his whole disposition , is uninterested in technical details or practical difficulties .
What appeal to him are the broad visions , the spacious comprehension of the social order as a whole which a planned system promises .
This fact that the tastes of the intellectual were better satisfied by the speculations of the socialists proved fatal to the influence of the liberal tradition .
Once the basic demands of the liberal programs seemed satisfied , the liberal thinkers turned to problems of detail and tended to neglect the development of the general philosophy of liberalism , which in consequence ceased to be a live issue offering scope for general speculation .
Thus for something over half a century it has been only the socialists who have offered anything like an explicit program of social development , a picture of the future society at which they were aiming , and a set of general principles to guide decisions on particular issues .
Even though , if I am right , their ideals suffer from inherent contradictions , and any attempt to put them into practice must produce something utterly different from what they expect , this does not alter the fact that their program for change is the only one which has actually influenced the development of social institutions .
It is because theirs has become the only explicit general philosophy of social policy held by a large group — the only system or theory which raises new problems and opens new horizons — that they have succeeded in inspiring the imagination of the intellectuals .
The actual developments of society during this period were determined , not by a battle of conflicting ideals , but by the contrast between an existing state of affairs and that one ideal of a possible future society which the socialists alone held up before the public .
Very few of the other programs which offered themselves provided genuine alternatives .
Most of them were mere compromises or halfway houses between the more extreme types of socialism and the existing order .
All that was needed to make almost any socialist proposal appear reasonable to these " judicious " minds , who were constitutionally convinced that the truth must always lie in the middle between the extremes , was for someone to advocate a sufficiently more extreme proposal .
There seemed to exist only one direction in which we could move , and the only question seemed to be how fast and how far the movement should proceed .
The significance of the special appeal to the intellectuals which socialism derives from its speculative character will become clearer if we further contrast the position of the socialist theorist with that of his counterpart who is a liberal in the old sense of the word .
This comparison will also lead us to whatever lesson we can draw from an adequate appreciation of the intellectual forces which are undermining the foundations of a free society .
Paradoxically enough , one of the main handicaps which deprives the liberal thinker of popular influence is closely connected with the fact that , until socialism has actually arrived , he has more opportunity of directly influencing decisions on current policy , and that , in consequence , he is not only not tempted into that long - run speculation which is the strength of the socialists , but is actually discouraged from it because any effort of this kind is likely to reduce the immediate good he can do .
Whatever power he has to influence practical decisions he owes to his standing with the representatives of the existing order , and this standing he would endanger if he devoted himself to the kind of speculation which would appeal to the intellectuals and which through them could influence developments over longer periods .
In order to carry weight with the powers that be , he has to be " practical , " " sensible , " and " realistic . "
So long as he concerns himself with the immediate issues , he is rewarded with influence , material success , and popularity with those who up to a point share his general outlook .
But these men have little respect for those speculations on general principles which shape the intellectual climate .
Indeed , if he seriously indulges in such long - run speculation , he is apt to acquire the reputation of being " unsound " or even half a socialist , because he is unwilling to identify the existing order with the free system at which he aims .
If , in spite of this , his efforts continue in the direction of general speculation , he soon discovers that it is unsafe to associate too closely with those who seem to share most of his convictions , and he is soon driven into isolation .
Indeed there can be few more thankless tasks at present than the essential one of developing the philosophical foundation on which the further development of a free society must be based .
Since the man who undertakes it must accept much of the framework of the existing order , he will appear to many of the more speculatively minded intellectuals merely as a timid apologist of things as they are ; at the same time he will be dismissed by the men of affairs as an impractical theorist .
He is not radical enough for those who know only the world where " with ease together dwell the thoughts " and much too radical for those who see only how " hard in space together clash the things . "
If he takes advantage of such support as he can get from the men of affairs , he will almost certainly discredit himself with those on whom he depends for the spreading of his ideas .
At the same time he will need most carefully to avoid anything resembling extravagance or overstatement .
While no socialist theorist has ever been known to discredit himself with his fellows even by the silliest of proposals , the old - fashioned liberal will damn himself by an impracticable suggestion .
Yet for the intellectuals he will still not be speculative or adventurous enough , and the changes and improvements in the social structure he will have to offer will seem limited in comparison with what their less restrained imagination conceives .
At least in a society in which the main requisites of freedom have already been won and further improvements must concern points of comparative detail , the liberal program can have none of the glamour of a new invention .
The appreciation of the improvements it has to offer requires more knowledge of the working of the existing society than the average intellectual possesses .
The discussion of these improvements must proceed on a more practical level than that of the more revolutionary programs , thus giving a complexion which has little appeal for the intellectual and tending to bring in elements to whom he feels directly antagonistic .
Those who are most familiar with the working of the present society are also usually interested in the preservation of particular features of that society which may not be defensible on general principles .
Unlike the person who looks for an entirely new future order and who naturally turns for guidance to the theorist , the men who believe in the existing order also usually think that they understand it much better than any theorist and in consequence are likely to reject whatever is unfamiliar and theoretical .
The difficulty of finding genuine and disinterested support for a systematic policy for freedom is not new .
In a passage of which the reception of a recent book of mine has often reminded me , Lord Acton long ago described how
At all times sincere friends of freedom have been rare , and its triumphs have been due to minorities , that have prevailed by associating themselves with auxiliaries whose objects differed from their own ; and this association , which is always dangerous , has been sometimes disastrous , by giving to opponents just grounds of opposition …
More recently , one of the most distinguished living American economists has complained in a similar vein that the main task of those who believe in the basic principles of the capitalist system must frequently be to defend this system against the capitalists — indeed the great liberal economists , from Adam Smith to the present , have always known this .
The most serious obstacle which separates the practical men who have the cause of freedom genuinely at heart from those forces which in the realm of ideas decide the course of development is their deep distrust of theoretical speculation and their tendency to orthodoxy ; this , more than anything else , creates an almost impassable barrier between them and those intellectuals who are devoted to the same cause and whose assistance is indispensable if the cause is to prevail .
Although this tendency is perhaps natural among men who defend a system because it has justified itself in practice , and to whom its intellectual justification seems immaterial , it is fatal to its survival because it deprives it of the support it most needs .
Orthodoxy of any kind , any pretense that a system of ideas is final and must be unquestioningly accepted as a whole , is the one view which of necessity antagonizes all intellectuals , whatever their views on particular issues .
Any system which judges men by the completeness of their conformity to a fixed set of opinions , by their " soundness " or the extent to which they can be relied upon to hold approved views on all points , deprives itself of a support without which no set of ideas can maintain its influence in modern society .
The ability to criticize accepted views , to explore new vistas , and to experience with new conceptions provides the atmosphere without which the intellectual cannot breathe .
A cause which offers no scope for these traits can have no support from him and is thereby doomed in any society which , like ours , rests on his services .
It may be that as a free society as we have known it carries in itself the forces of its own destruction , that once freedom has been achieved it is taken for granted and ceases to be valued , and that the free growth of ideas which is the essence of a free society will bring about the destruction of the foundations on which it depends .
There can be little doubt that in countries like the United States the ideal of freedom today has less real appeal for the young than it has in countries where they have learned what its loss means .
On the other hand , there is every sign that in Germany and elsewhere , to the young men who have never known a free society , the task of constructing one can become as exciting and fascinating as any socialist scheme which has appeared during the last hundred years .
It is an extraordinary fact , though one which many visitors have experienced , that in speaking to German students about the principles of a liberal society one finds a more responsive and even enthusiastic audience than one can hope to find in any of the western democracies .
In Britain also there is already appearing among the young a new interest in the principles of true liberalism which certainly did not exist a few years ago .
Does this mean that freedom is valued only when it is lost , that the world must everywhere go through a dark phase of socialist totalitarianism before the forces of freedom can gather strength anew ?
It may be so , but I hope it need not be .
Yet , so long as the people who over longer periods determine public opinion continue to be attracted by the ideals of socialism , the trend will continue .
If we are to avoid such a development , we must be able to offer a new liberal program which appeals to the imagination .
We must make the building of a free society once more an intellectual adventure , a deed of courage .
What we lack is a liberal utopia , a program which seems neither a mere defense of things as they are nor a diluted kind of socialism , but a truly liberal radicalism which does not spare the susceptibilities of the mighty ( including the trade unions ) , which is not too severely practical , and which does not confine itself to what appears today as politically possible .
We need intellectual leaders who are willing to work for an ideal , however small may be the prospects of its early realization .
They must be men who are willing to stick to principles and to fight for their full realization , however remote .
The practical compromises they must leave to the politicians .
Free trade and freedom of opportunity are ideals which still may arouse the imaginations of large numbers , but a mere " reasonable freedom of trade " or a mere " relaxation of controls " is neither intellectually respectable nor likely to inspire any enthusiasm .
The main lesson which the true liberal must learn from the success of the socialists is that it was their courage to be utopian which gained them the support of the intellectuals and therefore an influence on public opinion which is daily making possible what only recently seemed utterly remote .
Those who have concerned themselves exclusively with what seemed practicable in the existing state of opinion have constantly found that even this had rapidly become politically impossible as the result of changes in a public opinion which they have done nothing to guide — unless we can make the philosophic foundations of a free society once more a living intellectual issue , and its implementation a task which challenges the ingenuity and imagination of our liveliest minds .
But if we can regain that belief in the power of ideas which was the mark of liberalism at its best , the battle is not lost .
The intellectual revival of liberalism is already underway in many parts of the world .
Will it be in time ?
Only in America .
Tonight , or early tomorrow if John McCain makes a close race of it , the world will learn who is to be the 44th US President .
And , unless we are about to witness an upset that would make Harry Truman 's comeback win in 1948 against Thomas Dewey look routine , that person is expected to be Barack Obama .
At this brief moment of calm , when the campaigning is over but the result is not known , it is worth stepping back to consider just how amazing the event would be .
At one of the most difficult moments in its modern history , the US seems about to reach not to a grizzled senator or governor , not to a general or a businessman – but to a new and dazzling political talent who was virtually unknown barely four years ago .
Of course , Mr Obama has been fortunate .
He ran in a year that even before the financial meltdown was always going to be difficult for Republicans .
His marathon 50 - state primary battle against Hillary Clinton meant he had a solid organisation in place across the country well before the general election campaign began .
Indisputably , he has also had a gentler ride from the media than Mr McCain .
But gifted politicians make their own success .
Over the past two gruelling years , we have learnt a great deal about Mr Obama .
He is formidably intelligent .
Unlike the " tested " Mr McCain , he did not become rash or flustered at difficult moments .
The three candidates ' debates showed he is poised and collected under pressure .
It was said of Franklin Roosevelt , one of America 's very greatest presidents , that he had a second - rate intellect but a first - rate temperament .
On all the available evidence , Mr Obama is top class in both departments .
And by now the " inexperienced " tag has become somewhat worn .
Yes , assuming he is elected , he will bring a thinner CV to the office than perhaps any president in history .
But the past two years have tested him mightily .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Mr Obama has never run anything , it is said .
Not true .
He has run arguably the longest , the biggest and the best organised campaign ever .
Its discipline has been astonishing – in contrast to the campaign of Mrs Clinton that was once supposed to sweep all before it .
And he has taken on the Democratic Party establishment as represented by the Clintons .
In two years , Mr Obama has not made a major blunder .
Yes , he has had a dedicated , top - notch team around him .
But that too augurs well .
Clearly , Mr Obama knows how to put the right people in the right jobs , a vital part of being president .
And then , of course , he has style .
Not since JFK will America have had as charismatic and inspirational a leader .
Charisma and soaring oratory do not guarantee good government .
But America is demoralised , exhausted and broke .
It needs to turn the page on its recent past .
And for that , it needs words , as well as deeds , to inspire it .
The election of Barack Obama will be a gamble .
He may prove a disappointment like Jimmy Carter – another leader who emerged from nowhere , full of good intentions but overwhelmed by the job .
There is no knowing .
Nothing quite prepares a man for the presidency .
What is certain is that Mr Obama provides excitement , a desperately needed jolt of political electricity .
If he is elected , America will instantly be seen in a new light around the world – not just because the unloved George Bush is gone , but because the country has found it within itself to turn to someone truly new , whose astonishing ascent could have happened nowhere else on earth .
Only in America .
Polaroid cameras find new popularity among teens

Today 's hip teens are rarely seen untethered from their iPhone or Blackberry .
But many are just as loath to part with their Polaroid .
For retro hipsters - in - training , the ' 70s throwback is one of the hottest hand - me - downs around .
" When I know something exciting is gonna happen , I 'll take the Spectra , " Rachel Vogel said , holding up the boxy instant camera she inherited from her father .
" This is my baby , " she said , gazing at it lovingly .
Polaroid 's teenage acolytes so love the clunky cameras , which went out of production a few years ago , that they scour junk shops and Web sites to snag one .
And since the Concord , Mass .- based company announced in February that it would stop manufacturing instant film , fans are hoarding cartridges in refrigerators and closets or stacking it atop already cluttered bureaus .
Vogel , a petite and bespectacled 18 - year - old , insists she has no plans to spend hundreds of dollars she does n't have to amass the film .
That 's hard to believe , judging from the Polaroid snapshots she 's plastered like wallpaper next to her bed .
They offer a visual narrative of the past two years of Vogel 's life : the messy green pancakes she made with her friend Jessica ; another friend , Will , plucking the banjo at Menil Park ; the afternoon she and her buddies played connect the dots with their freckles .
" It 's nice to have a chronicle of all the people and stuff I 've done , " Vogel said .
Vogel 's digital camera just is n't the same .
For the younger generations , Polaroids add old - school charm to a PhotoShopped , digitally mastered age .
The cameras ' vintage look and slightly off - kilter color reels them in , but the near - instant gratification — point , click , wait two minutes — and the hold - in - your - hand payoff is what compels their hobby .
" It 's so much better to hold a picture in your hand than to see it on a computer screen , " Polaroid enthusiast Zoe Kanan said .
" I like the instantaneous thing you get from Polaroids , " added Gabriella Flournoy , who says at least 90 percent of her friends are addicted to their Polaroid cameras .
For these teens , the uncertainty of how the photo will turn out only adds to the Polaroid experience .
" When you take a Polaroid , you totally go on impulse , " Kanan said .
In March , Kanan and Flournoy , both 18 , were part of a teen group that contributed snapshots to " Polarize , " an exhibition that payed homage to the Polaroid at the Contemporary Arts Museum .
The Internet is flush with Polaroid diehards young and old who have come together to commiserate — posting Polaroid snapshots on photo - sharing Web sites , blogging in protest of the coming end of the Polaroid era .
On the social - networking site Facebook , more than 31,000 people belong to the group " Save the Polaroids . "
One of them is Kanan .
When designer and photographer Dave Bias learned of the film 's impending demise , he decided he was n't letting go without a fight .
Shortly after the company 's February announcement , he co-founded SavePolaroid.com .
" We thought we needed to take a stand on this if nothing else , " Bias , based in New York City , said of the effort .
" That way , the world would see that not only is Polaroid film viable , but there 's a market for it . "
The Web site lets grieving fans download " action packets " that include ready - to - mail letters imploring Polaroid to reconsider its decision and do - it - yourself stencils to help spread the word .
Bias said the campaign has attracted a couple of thousand responses .
With tens of thousands of fans rallying in Europe and Asia , Bias hopes that the enthusiasm and outrage lead to a revival of Polaroid film .
" It 's the film everyone knows , " he said emphatically .
" The Polaroid print has value .
It has worth .
It is real . "
As with many once - hot but now - extinct products , technology led to Polaroid 's downfall .
Instant photos may have been all the rage for consumers , but it was the commercial uses of instant film , such as the photos on driver 's licenses , that paid for the factories , according to Anne Wilkes Tucker , curator of photography at the Museum of Fine Arts Houston .
Much of that work is now done with digital cameras .
Wilkes sounded resigned as she dismissed rumors that Polaroid 's announcement was a publicity stunt to boost sales .
" It 's for real , " she said .
Wilkes said she worries about the cultural history illuminated by photographs that could vanish when instant film does .
" Most people never print the digital photograph , " she said .
" They just send them to friends ( on the Internet ) , and they stay in the computer . "
Despite Web speculation that a resurrection could be in the works , Polaroid remains mum .
A spokeswoman did not respond to interview requests before press time .
In the meantime , young fans such as Vogel and Kanan are bracing for the worst .
Vogel is planning to use her next paycheck to scoop up some instant film .
When the stores run out , she 'll be forced to resort to a task she hates — shopping for film on the Web .
Kanan figures she 'll have to give in and buy a digital camera .
" It 's cool , " she said , " but it 's not Polaroid . "

The meltdown in the global financial system may spare al - Qaeda .
Buoyed by years of record oil revenues in the Gulf and Afghanistan 's booming drug trade , al - Qaeda and other Islamic terrorist groups are thought to have access to strong potential funding sources - and thus might dodge fallout from the global crunch devastating others .
Yet all is not lost in the effort to rein in money for terror groups .
One principal reason the groups may avoid fallout now is because they 've been forced to pull away from banks , relying instead on less - efficient ways to move money .
Those methods - including hand - carrying money and using informal money - transfer networks called hawalas - likely will shield extremists from the current banking system turmoil .
But the methods also are slower and less efficient ways to move money - and thus could hamper efforts to finance attacks , analysts say .
" It would be inconceivable that large amounts of ( terror - linked ) money would transit through the formal financial system , because of all the controls , " said Ibrahim Warde , an expert on terrorist financing at The Fletcher School at Tufts University .
The question of where al - Qaeda and sympathizers get their money has long been crucial to efforts to prevent terror attacks .
A 2004 US Investigation found that banks in the United Arab Emirates had unwittingly handled most of the $ 400,000 spent on the September 11 attack .
After the attacks , the US made an aggressive push to use law enforcement techniques to disrupt terrorist financing networks and worked with allies to improve their own financial and regulatory institutions .
Despite those efforts , wealthy donors and Islamic charities in the oil - rich Gulf , especially in Saudi Arabia , continue to be " one of the most significant sources of illicit financing for terrorism , " said Matthew Levitt , a former US Treasury Department terrorism expert now with The Washington Institute for Near East Policy .
The Saudis have long insisted they are doing all they can to rein in terror financing , and US officials have praised their efforts .
But , under a system known as zakat , wealthy Muslims are required to give a portion of their money to the poor .
Much of that is given to Islamic charities , and US officials say at least some of the charities money continues to be channeled to al - Qaeda and other terror groups .
Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries have benefited over the last two years from a surge in oil prices from about $ 60 per barrel at the beginning of 2007 to more than $ 145 per barrel in the middle of this year .
Oil prices have fallen almost 50 % in the last few months in response to the global financial crisis , but not before the run-up generated hundreds of billions of dollars .
Levitt said the covert nature of terrorist financing makes it difficult to determine a direct correlation between rising oil revenues over the last few years and the amount of cash al - Qaeda has on hand .
But " it stands to reason that if there is more oil revenue , there will be more revenue for all kinds of things licit and illicit , " he said .
Al - Qaeda and the Taliban have also benefited from the drug trade 's growth in Afghanistan after the US - led invasion in 2001 - a booming business that likely wo n't be affected by the global slowdown .
Opium cultivation has fallen slightly this year but is still about 20 times higher than in 2001 , according to the UN Office on Drugs and Crime .
Former US drug czar Gen. Barry McCaffrey , who now works with NATO , issued a report on Afghanistan in July saying al - Qaeda and the Taliban " are principally funded by what some estimate as $ 800 million dollars a year derived from the huge $ 4 billion annual illegal production and export of opium / heroin and cannabis . "
Al - Qaeda and other extremist groups have gloated in recent weeks about the West 's financial woes , painting the crisis as either divine punishment for supposed wrongs or the last gasps of a dying empire .
Members of the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas and hard - liners in Iran also cheered the economic turmoil .
Iran is thought to be the last major government supporter of terror groups .
The majority Shiite country is not believed to finance al - Qaeda , a Sunni group , but does support Hizbullah in Lebanon .
Iran denies the financial crisis is hurting its economy , but falling oil prices will cut into its crude sales , which make up 80 % of the government budget .
It is unclear how that will affect support to Hizbullah .
Despite the apparent glut in potential money for terror groups , Levitt believes anti-terrorism efforts have hampered the groups ' ability to transfer money where they want .
Levitt points to several messages from senior al - Qaeda leaders in Pakistan and Afghanistan intercepted by the US or released by the terrorist group itself , asking Gulf supporters for more help because of funding shortfalls .
Most recently , the al - Qaeda leader in Afghanistan , Mustafa Abu al - Yazid , appeared in a May 2007 video saying " the mujahideen of the Taliban number in the thousands , but they lack funds . "
But Warde and other analysts are not convinced al - Qaeda is really hurting .
" Anybody who is involved in fundraising of any sort is never going to say we have enough money , so I think it is a silly argument to say that because there is this intercept … it is proof that everything we 've done has succeeded brilliantly , " said Warde .
Let 's face it , even hardcore privacy mavens probably appreciate the Internet 's magical ability to determine who should see that listing for used Smiths LPs and who would be more receptive to a subscription pitch for Cat Fancy .
But a new report from the Electronic Privacy Information Center , released Monday at the group 's Washington , DC , headquarters , warns that calculating how " people like you " are apt to vote is just one of the myriad ways network technology could prove a boon to online voter suppression campaigns .
If voting rights seem an odd cause for an organization dedicated to protecting privacy , consider that the art of political deception depends in large part in getting your lies to the right people : you need to make sure that only the other guy 's voters receive false information about eligibility requirements or polling locations .
Traditional dirty - tricks campaigns have used race and geography as a proxy for partisanship , blanketing ( for instance ) Dem - heavy African - American neighborhoods with flyers reminding everyone to bring two forms of ID when they turn out to the polls on Wednesday .
The first step in any online vote suppression effort , then , is to find a way to " microtarget " your message to the right set of voters .
And while it may be , as The New Yorker famously claimed , that " on the Internet , nobody knows you 're a dog , " quite a lot of people may know you 're a 27 - year - old Latino who buys books by Greg Palast and gave $ 250 to Dean for America .
Because such obvious target - rich - environments as the Daily Kos comment fora or the " One Million Strong for Obama " Facebook group are apt to be packed with folks ready and willing to correct misinformation , effective dirty - tricks campaigns will likely rely on the Internet 's ability to surreptitiously gather information from and build behavioral profiles of users .
The report , produced by EPIC's Lillie Coney and a team of contributors that included security guru Bruce Schneier and Multics coder–turned –National Committee for Voting Integrity chair Peter G. Neumann , outlines how — as Neumann put it via teleconference at EPIC 's offices Monday — " new technology opens up dramatically new avenues for disenfranchisement . "
First , information can be gathered by a variety of means , fair and foul .
A group might collect information on users who click through either genuine or bogus partisan advertisements , or who visit ideologically tinged sites , either in order to directly target them or for the purpose of " whitelisting " sympathetic voters .
The most obvious next step might be a simple spoofed e-mail containing bogus information .
Now , of course , these can exploit voter confusion about new electronic voting systems .
One deceptive e-mail recently circulated in Texas , for instance , warned voters that if they selected the option to vote a Democratic " straight ticket " on a touchscreen machine , they would still need to independently cast a presidential vote for Barack Obama .
On many systems , doing that would actually cancel out the " straight ticket " vote .
But a sophisticated vote suppression operation has many more options available .
For example , a phony website purporting to be operated by a state or county board of elections could be set up containing misleading information about poll locations or voting requirements .
The site URL could be directly e-mailed to targeted voters or , more sneakily , made to appear in search results for queries likely to be entered by those voters .
Speaking at the report launch , Coney noted that , as AOL inadvertently proved in 2006 , even " anonymized " search queries can be used to build a user profile specific enough to identify particular individuals .
Social networking sites obviously provide a wealth of information about likely political affiliations directly volunteered by users — often conveniently linked to e-mail addresses — but they also provide helpful social hints about the likely sympathies of the undeclared .
The " social graph " may also prove useful in determining which highly - connected folks are most likely to pass on misinformation to large numbers of friends , as a forward from a trusted source is generally treated as more credible than a blind e-mail from a stranger .
And as the report notes , that forwarding need not even be willing or witting : e-mail viruses could be used to blast a misleading message to a target 's whole address book .
VoIP , too , opens up new possibilities .
Deceptive robocalls are old hat , but the ability to cheaply phone target voters from overseas makes the tactic both more cost - effective and less traceable .
Activist Jon Pincus , a contributor who spoke by teleconference at the report launch , even broached the possibility of using distributed VoIP botnets to flood local voter information hotlines in predictably partisan districts — a sort of telephonic denial of service attack .
Fortunately , Pincus noted new technology also provides folks like him with new means to fight back against suppression and disruption campaigns .
The Twitter Vote Report Project hopes to allow for realtime reporting on such dirty tricks , facilitating rapid response by poll workers and activists .
And the Voter Suppression Wiki collates reports in more permanent form , so voters can recognize the telltale signs of scams , and learn how to counteract them .
Just a second though — one reporter at EPIC HQ wondered — do n't these efforts themselves present new targets for meta- disruption efforts ?
The query prompted a nervous chuckle from Tova Wang of the group Common Cause : " I had n't thought about that ...
Are you going to write about that ? "
But EPIC 's Coney shook her head gravely .
" Believe me , " she said , " anybody who reads this report and gets a new idea does n't have the capability to carry it out .
The people with the capacity to carry it out ?
They 've already thought of it all . "
By now you 've probably heard about how the super - duper 1337 h4ck3r5 from anonymous busted into one of Sarah Palin 's private email accounts and posted the contents for the world to see .
Well , it looks like those h4ck3r5 are n't as 1337 as one might think , as they left themselves pretty wide open to get busted for what they did .
You see , it appears that the hacker (s ) used the proxy Ctunnel.com to access the account .
Smart move , using a proxy !
What was less smart was including the entire address in your screenshots , as that kind of defeats the purpose of using a proxy .
Says Ctunnel.com owner Gabriel Ramuglia :
Usually , this sort of thing would be hard to track down because it 's Yahoo email , and a lot of people use my service for that .
Since they were dumb enough to post a full screen shot that showed most of the [ Ctunnel.com ]
URL , I should be able to find that in my log .

Oops !

BERKELEY , Calif . 
It is a classic road rally , 600 miles from the liberal embrace of Berkeley to the anything - goes lights of Las Vegas .
No speeding is allowed , or in some cases even possible .
And if you stop to refuel , it had better be in someone ’s trash .
On Saturday , five teams began the Escape From Berkeley , maybe the world ’s most eco-friendly motor race , driving all manner of alternative - fuel - burning jalopies , roadsters , and even a frying oil - fueled Mercedes - Benz , with a single goal : to complete the race using no petroleum .
“ Gentlemen , start your whatever they are , ” the M.C. shouted to begin the race , which offers the winner $ 5,000 .
The final catch of the race is that participants  artists , environmentalists and even a cattle farmer from Alabama  have to find or scavenge their go - go juice , whether it is used vegetable oil from restaurants or twigs and sticks from the side of the road .
All the vehicles , which had to be street legal , were allowed to start with a single gallon of whatever fuel they used .
Screenshots of The First Application That Supports ISO / IEC 29500 Blogosphere has been full of speculations about when and if ever Microsoft will support ISO / IEC 29500 format in MS Office .
Some people believe and wish that OpenOffice.org with ISO / IEC 29500 support will be released earlier then MS Office .
But do n't get fooled , the first application conforming to ISO / IEC 29500 is out , it is neither MS Office nor OpenOffice.org , it is coming from Free Software Foundation and you can see screenshots here .
OOXML is just bunch of XML files stored inside ZIP archive .
Conforming OOXML document must be valid against schemas provided in ISO / IEC 29500 and must follow few other rules which can't be directly expressed in schema ( like conforming to packaging rules defined in OPC ) .
Murata Makoto kindly provided me with RELAX NG schemas for ISO / IEC 29500 .
Having those schemas it was just matter of minutes to turn my good old Emacs into superb OOXML editor .
First I have to instruct Emacs to treat OOXML files with WordprocessingML as ZIP archives :
( setq auto - mode - alist ( cons '( " \\.docx\\ ' " . archive - mode ) auto - mode - alist ) )
After this change , I was able to browse packaged file and open any part inside it .
Figure 1 . Browsing OPC package in Emacs
There is a nice XML editing mode nxml from James Clark for Emacs .
I have associated OOXML schemas with corresponding namespaces in nxml configuration ( schemas.xml ) :
< namespace ns = " http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/wordprocessingml/2006/main " typeId=" WordML " /> < type Id id =" WordML " uri= " …/ WordprocessingML_Main_Document.rnc " />
From this point Emacs automatically validates each opened XML piece of package and provides me with autocompletition of element and attributes .
Figure 2 . Editing WordprocessingML inside Emacs
At least on this simple sample document Emacs is completely interoperable with MS Office as you can see on the following screenshot .
Figure 3 . Roundtripping of document between MS Office 2007 and Emacs
Now , when neither Microsoft nor OpenOffice.org team could be the first to provide ISO / IEC 29500 support I hope their focus will be on quality and conformance of their implementations .

Ed Harrison sent us a link to his latest post , and it ’s a doozy .
Most of us in the US who are financially - minded have been sufficiently caught up with the three ring circus of market turmoil , seemingly - a - new - trick - every - day Fed and Treasury interventions , and continuing financial firm implosions that we have n’t looked up much to see what is happening in the wider world .
Yes , the Baltic Dry Index is tanking , a bunch of Eurobanks nearly failed , but hey , that was two weeks ago , old news , Iceland collapsed , Argentina is on the ropes again ( but that seems to happen every five years ) , South Korea is wobbly , and plunging commodity prices are giving exporting countries big shocks .
But in the generally - provincial US , that amounts to background noise .
Your humble blogger has taken note of further worrisome developments , such as the dramatic fall in the Australian and New Zealand dollars ( 7 % on Friday , ouch , on top of steep falls before that ) , the pound and the euro without being sure what to make of that .
It appears to go beyond flight to quality ; some of its is high demand for dollars to unwind dollar - related trades , and the Friday action in particular , with big moves in the dollar and an even bigger rise in the yen , versus huge bid - asked spreads in some other currencies , seemed to be a flight to liquidity .
And then we have other countries looking shaky : the Baltics , Russia , a lot of Eastern Europe . and Latin America .
Harrison has focused on this constellation , and what he sees is not pretty :
In the last few weeks , the currency market is where the action has been …. all of this is a prelude to some sort of currency crisis … .
But , it is in commodity and emerging market currencies where the trouble is brewing .
First , we saw a nightmarish plunge of the Australian and Kiwi Dollar as commodities plummeted .
This all out assault on commodity and emerging market currencies then widened to include the Icelandic Krona , the South African Rand , the Polish Zloty , the South Korean Won , the Hungarian Forint , and the Mexican Peso amongst others .
This speaks to hot money fleeing emerging markets wholesale ….
today , I caught two interesting perspectives on this debacle that made me blanch .
One was the cover story in the Economist .
A few months ago , many emerging economies hoped they could take mass casual leave from the credit crisis …
This detachment has proved illusory … .
The IMF , which has shed staff this year because of the lack of custom , is now working overtime ( see article ) .
The governments of South Korea and Russia have shored up their banking systems .
Their foreign - exchange reserves , $ 240 billion and $ 542 billion respectively , no longer look excessive .
Even China ’s economy is slowing more sharply than expected , growing by 9 % in the year to the third quarter , its slowest rate in five years .
The emerging markets , which as the table shows enter the crisis from very different positions , are vulnerable to the financial crisis in at least three ways .
Their exports of goods and services will suffer as the world economy slows .
Their net imports of capital will also falter , forcing countries that live beyond their means to cut spending .
And even some countries that live roughly within their means have gross liabilities to the rest of the world that are difficult to roll over .
In this third group , the banks are short of dollars even if the country as a whole is not .
Yves here .
The whole article is very much worth reading .
Back to Harrison :
But , the analysis penned by Ambrose Evans - Pritchard is what really caught my eye .
He makes the case for us to worry about a full - scale currency crisis worse than the 1931 currency crisis of the Great Depression .
The link : Bank credit .
You can think of Sweden in the Baltics , Austria in Central Europe , Spain in Latin America — and you begin to picture the interconnectedness that will imperil Europe ’s banking system much more than either Japan ’s or America ’s :
The financial crisis spreading like wildfire across the former Soviet bloc threatens to set off a second and more dangerous banking crisis in Western Europe , tipping the whole Continent into a fully - fledged economic slump …
Experts fear the mayhem may soon trigger a chain reaction within the eurozone itself .
The risk is a surge in capital flight from Austria – the country , as it happens , that set off the global banking collapse of May 1931 when Credit - Anstalt went down – and from a string of Club Med countries that rely on foreign funding to cover huge current account deficits .
The latest data from the Bank for International Settlements shows that Western European banks hold almost all the exposure to the emerging market bubble , now busting with spectacular effect .
They account for three - quarters of the total $ 4.7 trillion £ 2.96 trillion ) in cross - border bank loans to Eastern Europe , Latin America and emerging Asia extended during the global credit boom – a sum that vastly exceeds the scale of both the US sub - prime and Alt - A debacles .
Europe has already had its first foretaste of what this may mean .
Iceland ’s demise has left them nursing likely losses of $ 74bn ( £ 47bn ) .
The Germans have lost $ 22bn .
Stephen Jen , currency chief at Morgan Stanley , says the emerging market crash is a vastly underestimated risk .
It threatens to become “ the second epicentre of the global financial crisis ” , this time unfolding in Europe rather than America .
Austria ’s bank exposure to emerging markets is equal to 85 pc of GDP – with a heavy concentration in Hungary , Ukraine , and Serbia – all now queuing up ( with Belarus ) for rescue packages from the International Monetary Fund .
Exposure is 50 pc of GDP for Switzerland , 25 pc for Sweden , 24 pc for the UK , and 23 pc for Spain .
The US figure is just 4 pc .
America is the staid old lady in this drama .
Amazingly , Spanish banks alone have lent $ 316bn to Latin America , almost twice the lending by all US banks combined ( $ 172bn ) to what was once the US backyard .
Hence the growing doubts about the health of Spain ’s financial system – already under stress from its own property crash – as Argentina spirals towards another default , and Brazil ’s currency , bonds and stocks all go into freefall .
Broadly speaking , the US and Japan sat out the emerging market credit boom .
The lending spree has been a European play – often using dollar balance sheets , adding another ugly twist as global “ deleveraging ” causes the dollar to rocket .
Nowhere has this been more extreme than in the ex-Soviet bloc .
The region has borrowed $ 1.6 trillion in dollars , euros , and Swiss francs .
A few dare - devil homeowners in Hungary and Latvia took out mortgages in Japanese yen .
They have just suffered a 40 pc rise in their debt since July .
Nobody warned them what happens when the Japanese carry trade goes into brutal reverse , as it does when the cycle turns .
When the markets open on Monday , I expect the crisis in Emerging markets to take top priority .
Iceland was the first victim of this crisis .
The dreadful events there should be a warning to policy makers to address this now or else we could see some awful writedowns at European institutions in the very near future — not to mention the potential economic destruction this turmoil could cause .
Yves again .
Now the meltdown may resume Monday , but another scenario may play out .
Recall 40 nations ( EU and Asian ) met in Beijing over the weekend , endorsing Nicolas Sarkozy ’s call for a revamping of international banking regulations and more coordinated , tougher supervision .
None of this directly addresses the looming currency crisis , but the markets sold off badly Friday , and if there is any stabilization or reversion on Monday , the backing away from the abyss plus the hope that the next phase of meetings , scheduled for November 15 in Washington DC , might ameliorate the situation , may put the currency crisis in abeyance for a couple of weeks .
And Brad Setser suggests another possible way out of this mess :
And while we are on the topic of “ stabilizing speculation , ” China could also shift some of its portfolios from dollars to euros and pounds and Brazilian real and Australian dollars and Russian rubles .
This is the time to diversify – not when the dollar is under pressure !
Dollar strength amid US weakness strikes me as a growing problem .
* Rescue is the wrong word .
Countries typically invests abroad to achieve their own policy goals — whether financial returns or strengthening their own ambitions to be a global financial center — not to “ rescue ” another country ’s banks and help another country stabilize its markets .
True rescues – investments with a high probability of a loss done to assure domestic financial stability – are generally done the government of the country that regulates the troubled financial institution .
No country wants to “ rescue ” another countries ’ banking system if that means losing money .
** The argument that China needs liquidity and only Treasuries are liquid does n’t really work – China ’s Treasury holdings are already so large that they are effectively illiquid , especially in the current market environment .
In this fraught environment , for China visibly ( and the key is visibly ) to start buying other currencies would have a disproportionate effect on psychology ( and be rewarding to China , since it would profit from the rally it helped engineer ) .
That might stem the panicked capital flight , and while it is probably insufficient to restore real stability , it could keep a necessary ( and painful ) revauluation / readjustment process from morphing into a rout .
Researchers have uncovered what may be a universal cause of aging , one that applies to both single cell organisms such as yeast and multicellular organisms , including mammals .
This is the first time that such an evolutionarily conserved aging mechanism has been identified between such diverse organisms .
The mechanism probably dates back more than one billion years .
The study shows how DNA damage eventually leads to a breakdown in the cell 's ability to properly regulate which genes are switched on and off in particular settings .
Like our current financial crisis , the aging process might also be a product excessive deregulation .
Researchers have discovered that DNA damage decreases a cell 's ability to regulate which genes are turned on and off in particular settings .
This mechanism , which applies both to fungus and to us , might represent a universal culprit for aging .
" This is the first potentially fundamental , root cause of aging that we 've found , " says Harvard Medical School professor of pathology David Sinclair .
" There may very well be others , but our finding that aging in a simple yeast cell is directly relevant to aging in mammals comes as a surprise . "
These findings appear in the November 28 issue of the journal Cell .

For some time , scientists have know that a group of genes called sirtuins are involved in the aging process .
These genes , when stimulated by either the red - wine chemical resveratrol or caloric restriction , appear to have a positive effect on both aging and health .
Nearly a decade ago , Sinclair and colleagues in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology lab of Leonard Guarente found that a particular sirtuin in yeast affected the aging process in two specific ways — it helped regulate gene activity in cells and repair breaks in DNA .
As DNA damage accumulated over time , however , the sirtuin became too distracted to properly regulate gene activity , and as a result , characteristics of aging set in .
" For ten years , this entire phenomenon in yeast was considered to be relevant only to yeast , " says Sinclair .
" But we decided to test of this same process occurs in mammals . "
Philipp Oberdoerffer , a postdoctoral scientist in Sinclair 's Harvard Medical School lab , used a sophisticated microarray platform to probe the mammalian version of the yeast sirtuin gene in mouse cells .
The results in mice corroborated what Sinclair , Guarente , and colleagues had found in yeast ten years earlier .
Oberdoerffer found that a primary function of sirtuin in the mammalian system was to oversee patterns of gene expression ( which genes are switch on and which are switch off ) .
While all genes are present in all cells , only a select few need to be active at any given time .
If the wrong genes are switched on , this can harm the cell .
( In a kidney cell , for example , all liver genes are present , but switched off .
If these genes were to become active , that could damage the kidney . )
As a protective measure , sirtuins guard genes that should be off and ensure that they remain silent .
To do this , they help preserve the molecular packaging — called chromatin — that shrink - wraps these genes tight and keeps them idle .
advertisement
The problem for the cell , however , is that the sirtuin has another important job .
When DNA is damaged by UV light or free radicals , sirtuins act as volunteer emergency responders .
They leave their genomic guardian posts and aid the DNA repair mechanism at the site of damage .
During this unguarded interval , the chromatin wrapping may start to unravel , and the genes that are meant to stay silent may in fact come to life .
For the most part , sirtuins are able to return to their post and wrap the genes back in their packaging , before they cause permanent damage .
As mice age , however , rates of DNA damage ( typically caused by degrading mitochondria ) increase .
The authors found that this damage pulls sirtuins away from their posts more frequently .
As a result , deregulation of gene expression becomes chronic .
Chromatin unwraps in places where it should n't , as sirtuin guardians work overtime putting out fires around the genome , and the unwrapped genes never return to their silent state .
In fact , many of these haplessly activated genes are directly linked with aging phenotypes .
The researchers found that a number of such unregulated mouse genes were persistently active in older mice .
" We then began wondering what would happen if we put more of the sirtuin back into the mice , " says Oberdoerffer .
" Our hypothesis was that with more sirtuins , DNA repair would be more efficient , and the mouse would maintain a youthful pattern gene expression into old age . "
That 's precisely what happened .
Using a mouse genetically altered to model lymphoma , Oberdoerffer administered extra copies of the sirtuin gene , or fed them the sirtuin activator resveratrol , which in turn extended their mean lifespan by 24 to 46 percent .
" It is remarkable that an aging mechanism found in yeast a decade ago , in which sirtuins redistribute with damage or aging , is also applicable to mammals , " says Leonard Guarente , Novartis Professor of Biology at MIT , who is not an author on the paper .
" This should lead to new approaches to protect cells against the ravages of aging by finding drugs that can stabilize this redistribution of sirtuins over time . "
Both Sinclair and Oberdoerffer agree with Guarente 's sentiment that these findings may have therapeutic relevance .
" According to this specific mechanism , while DNA damage exacerbates aging , the actual cause is not the DNA damage itself but the lack of gene regulation that results , " says Oberdoerffer .
" Lots of research has shown that this particular process of regulating gene activity , otherwise known as epigenetics , can be reversed — unlike actual mutations in DNA .
We see here , through a proof - of - principal demonstration , that elements of aging can be reversed . "
Recent findings by Chu-Xia Deng of the National Institute of Diabetes , Digestive and Kidney Diseases , has also found that mice that lack sirtuin are susceptible to DNA damage and cancer , reinforcing Sinclair 's and Oberdoerffer 's data .
This research was funded by the National Institutes of Health , and the Glenn Foundation for Medical Research .
David Sinclair is a consultant to Genocea , Shaklee and Sirtris , a GSK company developing sirtuin based drugs .
While we 're discussing McCain 's big mistakes , NYT reminds us of McCain 's one obvious gaffe of the campaign , when he told a group in Florida that the " fundamentals of the economy are strong " on the same day that Lehman collapsed .
We doubt this was decisive , but talk about a way to kill the buzz for his campaign right after his post - Palin pick highs .
The article is a good lesson in how gaffes become campaign fodder :
A thousand miles away , at Senator Barack Obama ’s campaign headquarters in Chicago , the aides who monitored Mr. McCain ’s every utterance knew immediately that they had just heard a potential turning point in a race that seemed to be tightening .
They rushed out to tell Dan Pfeiffer , Mr. Obama ’s communications director , what Mr. McCain , the Republican candidate , had just said , knowing that his words could be used to portray him as out of touch .
“ Shut up ! ” Mr. Pfeiffer said incredulously .
“ He said what ? ” Mr. Obama , who had just arrived at a rally in Colorado , hastily inserted the comments into his speech .
And by nightfall , the Obama campaign had produced an advertisement that included video of Mr. McCain making the statement that would shadow him for the rest of the campaign .
At the McCain campaign headquarters in Arlington , Va. , at almost the same moment that morning , Mr. McCain ’s chief strategist , Steve Schmidt , looked stricken when his war room alerted him to the comment .
Within 30 minutes , he was headed for a flight to Florida to join Mr. McCain as they began a frantic and ultimately unsuccessful effort to recover .
Politics is a sick game , and you need to be a liar to rise up through the ranks .
But reading stuff like this makes it seem very fun .
Maybe we 'll Netflix the War Room this week .

( Adds analyst comment , background , investor group not immediately available for comment , byline )
NEW YORK , Sept 24 ( Reuters ) - American International Group Inc's AIG.N shares fell sharply on Wednesday after the company finalized a deal that will put majority ownership in the hands of government .
Late on Tuesday , AIG said it had signed a “ definitive ” agreement for up to $ 85 billion in borrowings from the U.S. Federal Reserve , as part of a rescue by the central bank that will see it take a 79.9 percent stake in the giant insurer .
AIG shares were down 22 percent at $ 3.90 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange .
“ AIG is essentially nationalized , in our opinion , ” said Friedman , Billings , Ramsey analyst Bijan Moazami , in a research note .
The development almost certainly puts paid to investor hopes to thwart the government from taking majority ownership of the insurer , Moazami added .
A representative for an investor group that has been scrambling to work with AIG to raise funds to pay off the government before it exercises its option to take a large stake in AIG did not immediately return calls for comment .
( See related story : ID : [ ID : nN23394100 ] )
As part of the agreement , preferred stock will be held in trust for the U.S. Treasury , and convertible into common stock after a special shareholders ’ meeting to amend the company ’s certificate of incorporation , AIG said in a statement .
AIG Chief Executive Edward Liddy said agreeing to the government credit facility was “ the company ’s best alternative ” in the current market environment .
But AIG made it clear that the deal with the government carries a heavy price .
The giant insurer has to pay back the loan from , among other things , asset sales and new debt or share issues .
Not only will it pay 8.50 percentage points over 3 - month LIBOR , putting the current rate at well above 11 percent , but it will also pay a commitment fee equal to about $ 1.7 billion .
AIG will also pay a fee on undrawn amounts of 8.5 percent a year .
The interest and the fees will be added to the balance outstanding , the company said .
The Fed ’s rescue plan for AIG was unveiled Sept. 16 amid the most tumultuous week in financial markets in recent memory , narrowly averting the insurer ’s collapse under mounting mortgage losses .

Recently I had an interesting conversation with someone who leveled the following accusation :
“ You libertarians do n’t care if people die from lack of medicine , or if someone ca n’t afford a doctor .
Libertarianism is the freedom to die from a cold while the doctor who could treat you is doing a checkup for a rich guy who has nothing wrong with him .
You guys are so wrapped up in hating the government that you do n’t see the good it can do . ”
This is a frequent charge leveled against those who oppose some government intervention .
The assumption contained within the accusation is that if someone opposes the state performing some task , then one is in effect opposing anybody performing that task .
There are two possible ways that this accusation could be correct :
1 ) The task can only be done by the state .
Regardless of our desires to see the task done , it wo n’t happen without state action .
Therefore by opposing state action we are opposing any action that could attain that goal .
2 ) The task could be done by others , but we believe that it should n’t be done at all .
While I am sure one could find the occasional libertarian who is opposed to the broad mass of the people having access to good medical care , this is not true of the vast majority of libertarians .
Unsurprisingly like non-libertarians , most libertarians are fans of good health .
So clearly the second statement is not correct and we are left with the first one as the accusation .
But , is this correct ?
Is the state the only entity capable of accomplishing this goal ?
It ’s actually trivial to demonstrate that the state ca n’t assure people the highest quality of medical care .
But can it do a better job than other organizations ?
The answer is that it can do a “ better ” job , but at a cost that will wreck the economy .
Why Involve the State ?
The notion that the state is required to ensure that people have access to medical care is , itself , predicated on several assumptions :
1 ) It is bad when someone is allowed to die or goes unhealed when the means to save his or her life or health is available .
2 ) People who cannot afford to hire a doctor or purchase medicines will go untreated .
3 ) People are unwilling to voluntarily support others who are unable to pay for their own care .
4 ) Only the state can amass the funds needed to ensure that all are treated , since it can extract more money than people are willing to give up .
Can the state do it all ?
Unfortunately , while these assumptions at first seem reasonable , item number 4 is problematic in ways that supporters of state provisioning ignore at their own peril .
The first is that while state action can alleviate scarcity of medical care , it can not eliminate it entirely .
Consider Paul Newman .
Paul Newman was a wealthy man .
He had a personal doctor who was well paid .
This doctor probably had no more than 50 patients under his care .
Can state action provide a doctor for every 50 people ?
In the United States alone , this would require training 1,000 doctors for every doctor practicing today .
There would be more doctors than the combined population of plumbers , farmers , factory workers and shopkeepers .
Such an action , would take millions of workers out of working in other trades , trades where they paid taxes and put them in the position of consuming taxes .
Clearly this is untenable , at some point , the administrators of any system of providing medical care have to say “ no more ” and to stop providing additional care that may be technically possible , but economically unfeasible .
Instead , they should be looking at improving current care facilities and current medical practices , even marketing there current medical practices available with the likes of PracticeBloom or other marketing services that can allow more people to find available care options that they might not have otherwise seen .
Thus we see that even a government - administered program will have to accommodate scarce resources , permitting people to suffer who otherwise could be treated .
Is the state the one who does a better job ?
Even if the state can’t treat everyone , can it still do a better job than every other conceivable organization ?
To answer this question , we need to examine how medical care is provided on a free market .
Free market provisioning – simple
The simplest way that a person gets medical care in a free market is by waiting until he or she gets sick .
The sick person then goes to a store and purchases the medicines he or she needs or visits a doctor , paying for these services out of their cash balance .
Of course , if the person lacks the money to pay the doctor or the medicine owner , the illness wo n’t be treated .
The prices under such a scenario are set as follows .
Doctors and medicine makers charge whatever the market will bear .
After all , medical practice financing is required to enable doctors to open their own practice to treat people so its a given that they will require patients to be charged .
But if they set their prices too high , they wo n’t be paid at all .
Furthermore if their profits are sufficiently high , they will attract competition , more people choosing to become doctors .
These additional providers will compete for customers , charging whatever the market will bear for their services as well .
Eventually , an equilibrium will be reached where the supply of doctors is sufficient to supply all the patients who are willing to pay them sufficiently well for treatment .
Free market provisioning – Insurance
Illness is a stochastic process that visits people randomly .
The rates of illness in a large population are , however , predictable to a reasonable degree of accuracy .
This makes it quite possible for insurance companies to provide health insurance ; people pay a monthly or annual fee for coverage , and the insurance company pays for their illnesses .
People who get very sick benefit because the cost of care exceeds the premiums they pay to the insurance company .
The insurance company profits because the premiums they charge exceed the costs of the treatments they pay for .
The people who do n’t get sick may lose money , but should they get sick in the future , they are in a position to become benefactors .
The introduction of medical insurance , of course , results in higher prices in the short term as people who previously could not afford treatment are now able to afford treatment .
However , as in the previous simple scenario , the rise in prices would attract even more people to become providers .
Free market provisioning – Charity
Under the previous two methods , there is still a class of people who seek treatment who do n’t get it : people who cannot afford insurance .
The plight of this group will not go unnoticed ; some segment of their neighbors will be moved by their plight , and will want to help .
These neighbors make a gift of money , their services , or their non-money property to the needy , either by paying for services directly , giving gifts to the needy , or by giving gifts to organizations , known as charities , that distribute the gifts to the needy .
The supply of charitable gifts is dictated by how much the gift givers are willing to give in return for the psychic benefit they get for giving gifts .
These people choose how much they will give , and to whom based on what they are a ) able to spend , b ) how ‘ deserving ’ they feel the benefactor to be , c ) the predicted effect of the gift .
These benefactors are thus examining the need of the beneficiaries , the resources available to donate to the problem and how effectively those resources will solve the problem in choosing how much money to give .
Again , initially the action of charities will increase the demand for medical services and bid up prices .
Again , these higher prices will attract more providers to provide services , until once again prices have stabilized at a level where the number of providers is constant .
Deviation from Free Market – Medical Licensing
The free market provisioning of medical care assumes that anyone who wishes can hang a shingle form their door and go into business as a doctor .
It provides severe downward pressure on prices : any time doctors in a particular branch of medicine start making sufficient amounts of money to make the training profitable , it attracts more people to take up the profession .
The medical industry has reacted to this downward pressure by calling for the state to restrict the pool of practicing doctors .
This eliminates downward pressure on prices .
If the number of doctors is restricted , then the bidding war as patients fight for the few available slots will result in prices rising dramatically .
The more entry is restricted by these laws the more dramatic this phenomenon is .
Deviation from the Free Market – Subsidies
Earlier , we showed how charitable contributions tend to push prices higher .
This phenomenon becomes more dramatic once medical licensing is in place .
To understand this phenomenon , we must examine how prices are set at a free market .
Imagine an economy where A , B , C and D are interested in visiting a doctor .
This doctor can see 2 patients per day .
The prices they are willing to pay to see a doctor are :
Actor Willing to Pay A $ 110.00 B $ 80.00 C $ 60.00 D $ 50.00
To maximize his profits , the doctor must fill up his schedule .
If he posts a price of less than or equal to $ 80.00 per visit , he can fill his schedule with paying patients .
Thus , we can expect that the doctor will charge $ 80.00 .
Now let us examine what happens if some entity offers a $ 50.00 subsidy for patients wanting to visit the doctor but ca n’t afford it .
Now the demand schedule looks like this :
Actor Out of pocket + Subsidy = Payment to Doctor A $ 110.00 $ 0.00 $ 110.00 B $ 80.00 $ 0.00 $ 80.00 C $ 60.00 $ 50.00 $ 110.00 D $ 50.00 $ 50.00 $ 100.00
At this point the doctor finds himself deluged with patients .
Eventually , he finds himself wanting new equipment , or to hire more staff , and so he experiments with raising his price .
He raises his prices to $ 90.00 , then to $ 100.00 or more .
When his prices reach $ 110.00 , once again he is maximizing his income .
Any higher , and he will have empty slots in his schedule and lose business .
The effect of the subsidy , in the presence of significant barriers to entry for new providers is to increase prices .
The higher the subsidy , the more people it is offered to , the more dramatic this effect is .
If one looks at all the asset bubbles in recent history , all the sectors of the economy where prices are climbing faster than the rate of inflation , one finds generous government subsidies coupled with significant barriers to entry for new providers .
Of course , patient B , having been able to afford a doctor in previous days now finds himself out in the cold .
He is not offered a subsidy , but can not afford to see a doctor .
Unless he is very aware of economics , he will ask the subsidizer to include him in the subsidy as well .
This expansion in subsidy will result in still higher prices , creating another wave of people who no longer can hire a doctor .
The people in this wave then lobby for the expansion of the subsidy to include them .
If the cycle continues long enough , nobody will be able to afford the subsidy .
Deviation from the Free Market – Monopoly Customer
Another option is to establish a monopoly that takes over all payment to doctors .
This monopoly can avoid the phenomenon of competing consumers bidding up prices by taking over all payment decisions .
It sets a price , and a doctor who attempts to charge above the price is simply not paid .
This authority then sets prices according to its whim .
The entity can offer doctors below market wages , resulting in patients flooding the system .
Or , it can establish above market prices , leading to it having to outlay huge amounts of money .
The latter becomes a significant problem .
The monopoly must somehow acquire ( or create ) the money needed to pay for all these treatments .
However , unless this entity can increase the supply of doctors , it cannot expand medical care .
Unless more doctors are permitted to go into practice , the number of patients that can be treated remains the same as under the Free Market + Medical Licensing .
This problem can be easily solved , by having the monopoly guarantee all doctors above market wages , as follows :
In the scenario above , every day four patients sought medical treatment .
The single doctor was only able to treat two .
So the monopoly arranges to pay two doctors $ 80.00 per visit , resulting in a greater capacity than exists under Free Market + Medical Licensing .
At this point , the monopoly is obligated to pay $ 320.00 per day to treat all four patients .
The total number of dollars people were prepared to part with for medical care was $ 110 + $ 80 + $ 60 + $ 50 or $ 300.00 total .
Thus , the monopoly has to extract $ 20.00 from someone to pay for the extra medical care , diverting that money from other , more highly desired ends from some actor somewhere in the economy .
The State
The state is well positioned to act as such a monopoly .
It can , though taxes , extract as many resources as the economy can supply in order to maintain the monopoly payments .
Just as the state could , if its officers desire , land men on the moon , something that no organization depending on making a profit or voluntary donations will be able to do in the foreseeable future , the state could ensure that everyone gets reasonably good medical care .
However , this will come at significant cost .
The resources commandeered to pay these above market wages will necessarily impoverish the public .
In our scenario above , we had the state demanding that one or more people be forced to give $ 20.00 more than they would have liked to to cover the medical care of all actors .
This is money that would otherwise go to satisfying other consumer demands , such as food , better housing , beer or factories .
Additionally , the use of taxation to acquire the money needed generally means that patients pay $ 0.00 out of pocket .
This means that there is no cost ( other than the lost time and inconvenience ) for visiting the doctor .
This results in a massive spike in demand as people rush to visit the doctor more often .
Again , absent the lifting of the restriction on the number of practicing doctors , such a system will be plagued by long wait times and rationing via queues .
This power is also the state ’s Achilles heel .
Unlike a charity that depends on voluntary donations , the state does not have to do a good job to get money .
Even if the state spends the money in a lousy , inefficient manner , the money will continue to flow into its coffers ; people are denied the choice to withhold their money from the state .
Furthermore , for a government official , challenging inefficiency or generating efficient ideas requires effort .
The worse the problem being confronted the more effort the official must exert .
Such efforts are often psychically unpleasant .
Thus a significant number of officials will find the disutility associated with the effort to do better will far outweigh any possible personal benefit they accrue .
Again , we see this phenomenon demonstrated in countless government offices .
for example a significant portion of Medicare funding is consumed by fraudulent charges .
Government officials turn a blind eye to the fraud since they run no risk of being bankrupt by excessive claims .
As an aside , the proponents of state provisioning of medical services love to cite the low administrative costs of Medicare as a good thing , whereas it is precisely the skimping on administrative oversight which causes the overbillers to be able to perpetrate their fraud with impunity indefinitely .
It is not surprising that numerous studies analyzing private ( dependent on payments or voluntary donations ) ventures with public ones ( funded by force ) performing similar tasks found that , on average , the private ventures delivered the same service at only 75 % of the cost .
The importance of innovation
Having found that government provisioning of medical care is no panacea in the present , we should look at what is really required to make health care better for more people .
What is the engine driving improvements in medical care ?
In the end , it is the desire of doctors to do a better job , whether from professional pride or from a desire for more revenue .
In a free market , an innovation requires only a doctor and a patient agreeing to try it out .
In an environment where the state pays for medical care , the doctor or patient must convince the state to permit the test being tried .
For very innovative ideas , especially ones that are likely to trigger an episode of creative destruction , where whole branches of the field will be rendered obsolete or redundant , it is possible that the state will refuse to permit the innovation to take place .
Medical treatments that are available to the poorest among us today were not available to kings two centuries ago .
Two centuries ago no economy could have afforded to extend even the pitiful medical care that kings received to the entire population .
It is only through innovation , the discovery of new and cheaper ways of doing thing , that the care afforded by the wealthy can become available to the basic population .
Let us see how this works in a free market .
Let us consider some case where a doctor invents a new procedure that allows him to treat a condition at one - tenth the cost of the current treatment in vogue .
Of course , he starts providing this treatment , and pocketing the massive profits that accrue to him as a result .
The news of his procedure gets out .
Other doctors also adopt the practice .
Initially all who adopt the practice make unusually high profits .
These high profits attract additional providers to try to treat people with this procedure .
As the number of providers treating patients increase , the market - clearing price starts to fall .
New providers offer lower and lower prices in an attempt to fill their schedules .
This process continues until the profits to be earned by treating patients with the new treatment is too low to attract additional providers .
The result is that many more people are having their condition treated than were before .
Any regimen that slows or short circuits this process of innovation has the effect of denying the poor access to future medical care .
The important thing is that state regulation does hamper innovation .
It can do no other .
The result , present state regulation is harmful to future patients , and past regulation is harmful to patients in the present .
Must We Lean on the State ?
From the above analysis we can come to several conclusions :
1 ) It is impossible to make high quality medical care available to the most number of people while restrictive medical licensure laws make it difficult for new people to enter the medical profession .
2 ) While government action can expand the amount of care available today , it does so at an expense of less medical care in the future .
3 ) The government will either have to ration care , or heavily tax people to accomplish the goal of expanding medical care to more people in the short term .
4 ) The function performed by the state can be done more cost effectively by charities funded by donations .
Thus we see that the earlier assumption 4 , that only the state can amass the needed resources , is not correct .
Additionally , we can question the applicability of assumption 3 , given that most governments that provide medical care or subsidize it are representative ones , where the population picks the lawmakers .
Obviously , since government provisioning on health care is voted into law by representatives selected in popular elections , it is safe to say that a sizeable portion of the population are willing to donate money to care for those who are unable to afford care .
We can clearly see that the state is neither the only organization that can provide medical care , nor is it very efficient in doing so .
Conclusions
We can see that far from being heartless , the supporter of free markets is really attempting to make medical care cheaper and more widely available , and that the advocate of government involvement is inevitably arguing for a system that is inefficient , not innovative and that in the long term will do a poor job of extending quality care to the poor who cannot afford it today .
While in the short term , the state can commandeer impressive resources and make massive strides towards acheiving some goal , in the long term such actions can be very detrimental .
Keith reports on how John McCain is still searching for an economic message to grab on to .
Come on , people ... scurrilous and relentless smearing can only cut into Obama 's lead in the polls so much .
" Since Senator McCain has become fond of posing everything he says in the form of a question : With the Dow already Dow 17 % for the week so far , do you think , Senator McCain , that Americans give a crap about rehabilitated 60's radical William Ayers ?
With the Dow on track for it 's biggest weekly percentage drop ever , do you believe , Senator McCain , that voters would be in favor of your self - named ' American Home Ownership Resurgence Plan ' if they realize that it would resurge only the balance sheets of financial institutions , passing all their losses to American taxpayers ? "
As if McCain 's erratic flailing on the paramount issue of the election were n't enough , Marc Ambinder is reporting that McCain 's new " plan " may actually be illegal under the terms of the bailout bill he " suspended " his campaign in order to pass .
I kid you not .
Marc Ambinder :
Folks who are much more savvy on the specifics of the Troubled Asset Relief Program ( TARP ) wonder whether the government 's $ 700 billion bailout / rescue program expressly prohibits what John McCain now says he wants to do -- and that is to have the government buy distressed mortgages at face value from banks and renegotiate their terms with homeowners .
They point me to Section 101e of the law , which requires the Secretary of the Treasury to " take such steps as may be necessary to prevent unjust enrichment of financial institutions participating in a program established under this section "
So if they buy it at face value , would n't they violate the law ?
It 's almost as if Obama does n't even have to talk about the economy anymore .
McCain is doing enough damage to himself .
UPDATE : ( Nicole ) The Public Campaign Action Fund has put together a report ( .pdf ) that shows that McCain 's plan has his lobbyist buddies ' fingers all over it .
The WSJ said today that it would benefit lenders , including predatory ones .

Yahoo must have adopted a strange new policy of putting acquisitions to good use , exhibited in its latest form by the announcement of Yahoo Web Analytics .
Marketed as " an enterprise site analytics tool , " the private beta of Yahoo Web Analytics reveals a clear initial focus on business and commercial web sites , and some unique features could give competitors like Google a run for their money .
Yahoo Web Analytics is the result of Yahoo's April acquisition of IndexTools , a web analytics software provider geared toward online marketing .
With such a quick turnaround into a Yahoo product , albeit as a private beta for Yahoo's 150,000 small - to medium - size business web site customers , it 's clear that Yahoo is gunning to gain share in a market it arguably should have been neck - deep in years ago .
Yahoo's choice to acquire IndexTools and the upcoming features in Yahoo Web Analytics also speak loudly for how badly the company wants a piece of the market .
Specifically , Yahoo Web Analytics boasts " near real - time " data aggregation and visualization , which — if true — will be a significant leg up on Google Analytics ' typical 8 - to 12 - hour turnaround time .
In addition to faster data , Yahoo will also provide all analytics data in raw form , instead of a periodic aggregation of things like total visitors to a page .
This access to data becomes quite significant with Yahoo's promise of a forthcoming API , another feature that Google Analytics does n't match — at least not yet .
This API will allow developers to access data for things like aggregating popular content , comparing with other data sets , exporting for backup , or moving to another system .
Being Yahoo's primary competitor in the free analytics space , though , Google is unlikely to let this challenge go unanswered , especially since Yahoo now offers an appealing combination of hosting and analytics packages .
If Yahoo wants to gain relevance in this space , it 's going to have to act quickly and open the beta up to the rest of the market .
Perhaps most importantly , Yahoo will have to get the API in the hands of developers before Google ramps up to feature parity and removes the temptation for customers to switch .

Police say the man robbed the store early Monday , tied up the female clerk and then ran out the door with a carton of cigarettes .
After the man realized he forgot the bag of money he tried to go back inside the store but could n't because the door was equipped with an electronic lock .
STILLWATER , OKLA . ( Fortune Small Business ) --
The drilling rig rose incongruously over the peaceful college town of Stillwater , Okla .
It roared and screeched with activity .
Roughnecks , slathered head to toe in mud , scrambled and cursed a blue streak as they threw chain and tripped out two - ton stands of pipe .
D.G. , a.k.a.
" Stretch , " a good - natured chain hand , weighed in with a salvo of riotously profane slander , largely addressed to his fellow oil drillers .
It could have pinned back the ears of the most depraved drill sergeant on earth .
It could have peeled paint .
" There , write that in your magazine ! " he yelled with a grin .
I had joined these characters on the Stillwater Project oil rig because , against the back - drop of a global energy crisis , I was hoping to witness the moment when a rock hound named Mark Herndon found out whether he could actually strike oil by drilling horizontally beneath a small Oklahoma city .
Everyone is here because of Herndon .
There 's the full hierarchy of the oil patch - from the lowliest worm hand to the studly directional drillers with their black books and their azimuths , rocking out to Neil Young in their air - conditioned trailers , to Bob Graves , 48 , the drilling superintendent , whose job is to keep the rig running at all times , to Jess Porter , 56 , president of EEC Inc. , who found the 17 investors from Oklahoma and as far away as Indiana .
They 're all here because Herndon , an independent oil geologist , had a thought - a fleeting moment of inspiration - while driving down the road in the middle of the night two decades ago .
The " unconventional stratagraphic play " Herndon dreamed up was about oil hidden in a tight , ten - foot zone of sandstone a mile deep that nobody had ever bothered to drill for , perhaps because it lay beneath a city .
But what if somebody drilled , horizontally , beneath the Wal - Mart ( WMT , Fortune 500 ) and the Applebee 's and the Starbucks ( SBUX , Fortune 500 ) , beneath the campus of Oklahoma State University , winding up directly under Boone Pickens Stadium ?
What if the fancy new tools of directional drilling could bore a mile into the earth , make a 90 - degree gradual bend , and hit a target the size of a beach ball ?
Whoever pulled that off might find a million barrels of oil .
Or , they might not .
The biggest bet
In the preceding months another principal character , Dave Swafford , 51 , the project 's land man , had performed a small miracle - securing more than 500 drilling leases from city residents , including the City of Stillwater and Oklahoma State University , all while keeping the deal more or less secret .
With the leases secured , it would cost Jess Porter more than $ 3 million to find out whether Mark Herndon 's idea was worth anything .
For his part , Herndon would pony up $ 60,000 to establish a 1/32 interest in the well .
His payoff could be more than $ 3 million .
The lead investor , known in the business as the " bell cow " for the ability to attract other investors , stood to make more than $ 30 million .
It was a simple but elegant scheme .
" A great idea , " said Swafford , beaming .
" Even if it 's a dry hole , it 's still one hell of an idea . "
It would be quite a trick if they could pull it off - the biggest bet that Herndon and Porter and Swafford had ever made , definitely a company maker , as wells like this are sometimes called .
" It 's my all - in moment , " says Herndon , a thoughtful , talkative bear of a man who in those nerve - racking few days was usually found wearing shorts , an oil - stained T - shirt , and nerdy glasses , clutching a cigarette in one hand and a bottle of Mountain Dew in the other .
Herndon 's task was to find and then drill horizontally through what everyone hoped would be an oil - laden geological zone called the Lower Skinner Sandstone .
Most vertical wells tap just the smallest fraction of a zone .
But a well that moved horizontally through oil - bearing rock would be , as Herndon liked to say , a screamer .
It had taken directional drilling technology 20 years to catch up to Herndon 's idea .
Using his knowledge of the strata below , Herndon would guide the directional drillers and the tons of pipe that trailed the bit along a gradual 90 - degree bend to their landing point , a target 4,376 feet beneath Boone Pickens Stadium .
Herndon needed to hit the Lower Skinner dead - on .
If he missed , the only way to find the zone would be to start dragging tons of pipe up and down - to porpoise - and risk getting $ 700,000 worth of drilling gear stuck underground .
Once in the zone , Herndon 's next task would be to determine whether it contained enough oil , or " pay , " to continue .
In the old days oil might simply gush to the surface .
Now the weight of tons of drilling mud held back gushers of oil and gas .
Rock cuttings from the drill bit percolated upward through the mud .
A mud logger would collect cutting samples and catalog them while Herndon peered through a microscope at the tiny specks looking for " show . "
Under a black light , oil will fluoresce and turn gold .
A nice glow would mean that he had a producing well .
No glow would mean no go - Herndon would be out 60 grand , and Jess Porter would have himself a $ 3 million hole in the ground .
The closer the drilling crew brought the bit to its target , the more Mountain Dews and cigarettes Herndon consumed .
Herndon , 47 , is a former parachuting BASE jumper , rock climber , and wilderness backpacker .
But he does not consider himself a gambler .
" It 's really all about risk management , " he says .
" The gamblers eventually disappear . "
He 's been calling his own shots since graduating from the University of Oklahoma with a degree in petroleum geology .
He lived through the great oil bust of the early 1980s , when the price of oil plummeted to $ 9 a barrel and many of his colleagues fled the business .
Herndon hung on , sometimes just barely , and over two decades has learned every aspect of wildcat prospecting , from generating geological " ideas " - educated guesses as to where oil and gas may hide in the strata - to attracting investors , to haggling with farmers over mineral leases , to hiring drilling crews , even to digging ditches for gas pipelines .
In recent years , soaring fossil - fuel prices have completely transformed the hardscrabble world of independent oil drilling .
Here in Oklahoma , locals are quitting full - time jobs to hire themselves out as hands on drilling rigs .
Specialized skills - such as Herndon 's 25 years of oil geology experience - are at a premium .
Right now Herndon is so busy that he can't keep up with all the prospecting work .
" I 'd never go to work for a big oil company , " he says .
" Sure , you get a good salary , but you do n't get equity in the wells . "
After accumulating interest in dozens of wells , Herndon was able to take several years off .
He took up photography and lived off his royalties until the current boom made the Stillwater Prospect economically possible .
" Stillwater was feasible when oil was at $ 60 a barrel , " says Jess Porter .
" Now it 's just amazing . "
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
More than one dozen cases of liver failure and death were reported in patients taking GlaxoSmithKline Plc ’s Avandia , advocacy group Public Citizen said on Thursday in a petition calling for a ban of the diabetes drug .
But GlaxoSmithKline defended its drug , saying its own review by an independent panel earlier this year said the liver risks were acceptable .
“ We do not believe there is a connection between liver toxicity and this medicine , ” the company said in a statement , adding it had not yet read the group ’s petition .
Public Citizen said its review of U.S. Food and Drug Administration data found 14 previously unpublished cases of severe drug - induced liver failure , including 12 deaths .
That risk , coupled with other known complications that include heart failure , fractures and vision loss , was too great to allow the drug to continue to be sold in the United States , especially with other treatments available , it said in a petition to the FDA .
“ The evidence for this unique combination of toxicities is compounded by the accompanying lack of evidence of any clinical benefit , compared to other approved drugs for diabetes , ” the petition said .
Sales of Avandia -- also known as rosiglitazone and part of a new class of drugs to treat type 2 diabetes called glitazones -- have plunged in the past year after the heart risk surfaced in an analysis of available clinical studies .
Since then , experts at two major diabetes associations have withdrawn their support of the drug , instead backing lifestyle changes such as diet and exercise as well as other treatments .
Still , Public Citizen estimated about 10,000 prescriptions continue to be filled each day .
“ Thus , it is urgent for the FDA to immediately ban rosiglitazone , ” it said .
Representatives for the FDA did not immediately return requests for comment .
The British drugmaker ’s shares trimmed earlier gains and were off 94 cents , or 2.5 percent , at $ 36.37 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange .
In London , its shares were down more than 2 percent .

Yesterday , beloved punkin ’ pundit Chuck Todd went on the air with MSNBC and voiced something that some people have been wondering about for a while : Do John McCain and Sarah Palin actually kind of hate one another ?
In describing NBC ’s series of interviews between Brian Williams and the running mates , Todd said :
There was a tenseness between the two .
There ’s no chemistry .
I could n’t see chemistry between John McCain and Sarah Palin .
I felt as if we grabbed two people and said , ‘ Here , sit next to each other , we ’re going to conduct an interview . ’
They ’re not comfortable with each other yet .
The other thing about it is , you can tell they know that they ’re losing .
They ’re drained , their campaign seems drained …
Todd went on to emphasize what he described as “ the odd body language . ”
He wondered also whether they were each blaming one another for perceived problems with the campaign .
Now that this suspicion has been bared , you can expect to see it more and more .
“ Body - language experts ” may be called in , “ insiders ” will be quoted , and if the McCain - Palin ticket loses ( something that is further from reality than many Dems hope ) , it will almost assuredly be a plotline in campaign postmortems .
Yesterday , beloved punkin ’ pundit Chuck Todd went on the air with MSNBC and voiced something that some people have been wondering about for a while : Do John McCain and Sarah Palin actually kind of hate one another ?
In describing NBC ’s series of interviews between Brian Williams and the running mates , Todd said :
Here are a few isolated incidents or situations which were heretofore viewed as unrelated , but which we predict the media will try to link together if they go with the whole “ McCain / Palin ” tension meme :
1 . The body language during the NBC interviews .
We did n’t really see the tension between them that Chuck Todd described during last night ’s Nightly News segment ( maybe that ’s more obvious in later portions ? ) , but we did notice that every time Palin talked , McCain looked quietly downward , as though he was trying very , very hard to listen .
Or pray ?
2 . The idea of Palin as running mate was sprung on McCain at the very last minute by his two strong - willed advisers , Fred Davis and Steve Schmidt .
This weekend ’s New York Times Magazine story reveals just how short a time period it was between when Davis and Schmidt unilaterally presented their case and when the announcement was made by McCain ( five days ) .
According to the story , McCain made up his own mind , but in retrospect he may regret the timing and spin .
3. Palin and McCain do n’t actually agree on everything .
Palin famously protests McCain ’s resistance to ANWR drilling , which the campaign dealt with early on .
But then Palin ankled McCain by publicly protesting his decision to pull out of Michigan .
They are n’t the big issues of the race , but it ’s far from the eventual lockstep displayed by the Obama - Biden ticket .
4. Palin seems to be bristling at the fact that she ’s so closely managed .
Anyone as tough and driven as Sarah Palin ca n’t enjoy being so closely controlled ( and perhaps as mistrusted ) as she is by the McCain campaign .
This week , Palin said during her NBC interview that she would release her medical records , something Chuck Todd later pointed out “ was a surprise to her campaign staff . ”
5. Palin is an easy scapegoat for McCain .
Colin Powell , Kathleen Parker , David Frum , Matthew Dowd … all those people should have firmly been in the Arizona senator ’s camp , but they ’re now voicing what many conservatives are thinking : Palin ’s inexperience is crippling the ticket .
If he loses , all McCain will have to do is agree with them .
6. McCain is an easy scapegoat for Palin .
The governor of Alaska may bill herself as a hockey mom , but she ’s no fool — as The New York Times Magazine pointed out , once she was elected , she was careful to impress , and forge alliances with , every important conservative she came across , including Dick Morris , William Kristol , and any other neocon who happened to drift by Juneau in a cruise ship .
She impressed many by being a tough cookie , but she ’s been caught off guard by a lot of the pressures and questions during the campaign .
With more time to prepare , she could have been a much more viable candidate in four or eight — or even twelve — years .
As Tina Brown pointed out , Palin might just realize that by picking her before she was ripe , McCain might have shriveled her future chances at the White House .
With allies like Kristol and Morris , she can build upon these mistakes by blaming them on — who else ? — John McCain .
EVEN the most majestic cities are pockmarked with horrors .
The knowledge that every shade of architectural experience , from sublime to excruciating , can exist in such compressed space is part of a city ’s seductive pull .
Yet there are a handful of buildings in New York that fail to contribute even on these grounds .
For them the best solution might be the wrecking ball .
Not a day goes by , I would guess , that a Parisian strolling through the Luxembourg Gardens does n’t glance up at the lifeless silhouette of the Montparnasse Tower and wish it away .
The endlessly repeated joke is that the tower offers the best views in the city because it is the only place from which you can not see it .
Many New Yorkers feel the same way about the MetLife Building ( formerly the Pan Am Building ) , whose dull gray concrete facade punctuates the southern end of Park Avenue like an anvil , blotting out a once - glorious view of Grand Central Terminal .
In my own neighborhood near Union Square I ’ll occasionally catch people shaking their heads as they pass by a bizarre confection decorated with a vulgar pattern of gold rings on 14th Street .
So here ’s what I propose .
True , the city is close to broke .
But even with Wall Street types contemplating the end and construction of new luxury towers grinding to a halt , why give in to despair ?
Instead of crying over what ca n’t be built , why not refocus our energies on knocking down the structures that not only fail to bring us joy , but actually bring us down ?

Love Chile Peppers ?
Come learn about 39 different chile peppers .
Some are mild like the Anaheim and some are so hot they are literally being used as weapons .
Complete with information about their origin and history , uses , and full - color photographs !
or as Available on Amazon.com or as a PDF Download
Caution : when working with chili peppers , be sure to wear disposable food gloves since the oils from the chili peppers is very difficult to get off of your hands and will burn your eyes and other sensitive body parts .
Choose ripe jalapeno peppers that are firm , fresh , and red and wash and dry them thoroughly .
You will get about 1 pound of chipotles for every 10 pounds of jalapeno peppers you use .
You can leave the jalapeno peppers whole , or if you 'd like to reduce the drying time you can cut off the stems and slice the jalapeno peppers open , being careful not to lose too many of the seeds .
If you 'd like to take away some of their heat , you can remove the seeds and membranes since that 's where a lot of the jalapeno heat comes from .
Put the jalapano peppers in a smoker and cold smoke them for 8 to 16 hours .
If you do n't have a smoker , there are many available .
Or , if you want to make your own smoker , you can find directions here or here
Make sure your smoker is very clean before you start smoking the jalapeno peppers , otherwise it may impart stale food flavors into your chipotles .
You want the peppers to end up black , dry , leathery , and brittle to make sure the flavor will be preserved .
Since this can take a long time , many people will finish off the peppers in a food dehydrator or oven ( below 200 degrees ) over night .
Store the peppers in a cool , dark , and dry place for up to 6 months .
You can also make chili powder by grinding up the dried peppers .

Following his loss to George W. Bush in the 2000 South Carolina primary , John McCain did something extraordinary :
He confessed to lying about how he felt about the Confederate battle flag , which he actually abhorred .
" I broke my promise to always tell the truth , " McCain said .
Now he has broken that promise so completely that the John McCain of old is unrecognizable .
He has become the sort of politician he once despised .
The precise moment of McCain 's abasement came , would you believe , not at some news conference or on one of the Sunday shows but on " The View , " the daytime TV show created by Barbara Walters .
Last week , one of the co-hosts , Joy Behar , took McCain to task for some of the ads his campaign has been running .
One deliberately mischaracterized what Barack Obama had said about putting lipstick on a pig -- an Americanism that McCain himself has used in the past .
The other asserted that Obama supported teaching sex education to kindergarteners .
" We know that those two ads are untrue , " Behar said .
" They are lies . "
Freeze .
Close in on McCain .
This was the moment .
He has largely been avoiding the press .
The Straight Talk Express is now just a brand , an ad slogan like " Home Cooking " or " We Will Not Be Undersold . "
Until then , it was possible for McCain to say that he had not really known about the ads , that the formulation " I approve this message " was just boilerplate .
But he did n't .
" Actually , they are not lies , " he said .
Actually , they are .
McCain has turned ugly .
His dishonesty would be unacceptable in any politician , but McCain has always set his own bar higher than most .
He has contempt for most of his colleagues for that very reason :
They lie .
He tells the truth .
He internalizes the code of the McCains -- his grandfather , his father : both admirals of the shining sea .
He serves his country differently , that 's all -- but just as honorably .
No more , though .
I am one of the journalists accused over the years of being in the tank for McCain .
Guilty .
Those doing the accusing usually attributed my feelings to McCain being accessible .
This is the journalist - as - puppy school of thought :
Give us a treat and we will leap into a politician 's lap .
Not so .
What impressed me most about McCain was the effect he had on his audiences , particularly young people .
When he talked about service to a cause greater than oneself , he struck a chord .
He expressed his message in words , but he packaged it in the McCain story -- that man , beaten to a pulp , who chose honor over freedom .
This had nothing to do with access .
It had to do with integrity .
McCain has soiled all that .
His opportunistic and irresponsible choice of Sarah Palin as his political heir -- the person to whom he would leave the country -- is a form of personal treason , a betrayal of all he once stood for .
Palin , no matter what her other attributes , is shockingly unprepared to become president .
McCain knows that .
He means to win , which is all right ; he means to win at all costs , which is not .
At a forum last week at Columbia University , McCain said , " But right now we have to restore trust and confidence in government . "
This was always the promise of John McCain , the single best reason to vote for him .
America has been cheated on too many times -- the lies of Vietnam and Watergate and Iraq .
So many lies .
Who believes that in Afghanistan last month only five civilians were killed by the American military , instead of the approximately 90 claimed by the Afghan government ?
Not me .
I first gave up on the military during Vietnam and then again when it covered up the death of Pat Tillman , the Army Ranger and former NFL player who was killed in 2004 by friendly fire .
McCain was going to fix all that .
He was going to look the American people in the eyes and say , not me .
I will not lie to you .
I am John McCain , son and grandson of admirals .
I tell the truth .
But Joy Behar knew better .
And so McCain lied about his lying and maybe thinks that if he wins the election , he can -- as he did in South Carolina -- renounce who he was and what he did and resume his old persona .
It wo n't work .
Karl Marx got one thing right -- what he said about history repeating itself .
Once is tragedy , a second time is farce .
John McCain is both .
Motorists are n't the only ones struggling to cope with record gasoline prices .
The economic epidemic has left the retail gasoline business in the shakiest condition he 's seen in 40 years , said Ed Weglarz , executive vice president of Farmington Hills - based Associated Food and Petroleum Dealers .
" As customers , you can't believe you 're paying $ 4 per gallon , but the retailers are in the very same boat , " he said .
" They are severely impacted by the gas prices . "
Retail gas licenses dropped to 4,928 in 2006 from 5,076 the year before -- a 2.9 percent decrease , the Michigan Department of Agriculture said .
Several Saginaw County gas stations , including the BP station at 8815 Main in Birch Run , have shut their doors in recent months .
Others , including the Marathon at 4570 Dixie Highway in Bridgeport , are closed temporarily .
" It 's dire out there , " Weglarz said .
" Just in my travels , I 've seen more and more gas stations boarded up -- and I 'm not even looking for them . "
The number of retail gasoline outlets in the United States dropped by almost 2 percent in 2007 from 2006 , reported the trade publication NPN Magazine .
Preliminary numbers indicate another drop this year , to 161,368 outlets .
The price of gas , which has exceeded $ 4 per gallon , and credit card fees ultimately are to blame for most closings , Weglarz said .
" Retailers are making the same amount of money -- five cents per gallon -- than they were making when gas was a buck and a half , " he said .
" You can't survive that way .
That 's not enough to support your expenses .
" The credit card fees themselves eat you up because they 're a percentage of every gas sale . "
' Terrible '
Vaughn Dietzel , owner of Myers Oil Co. in Tittabawassee Township , had one word to describe the state of the retail gasoline business -- terrible .
" It 's the credit card fees that are killing everybody , " Dietzel said .
It costs his business up to 10 cents per gallon when consumers use a credit card at the pump .
Myers Oil , which operates Myers Mobil Mart , 215 S. Main in Freeland , easily could pay $ 200,000 in credit card expenses in the next year , Dietzel said .
Also adding to the cost is the sales tax the state enforced on gasoline Nov. 1 , 2007 .
Dietzel said sales taxes cost customers 23 cents per gallon to fill up at Michigan gas stations Monday .
" Michigan is typically above the national average now ( in gas prices ) , " he said .
Operators at other stations , such as Fast Pax Food Store , 8795 Main in Birch Run , said they have n't felt the effects of rising gas prices so far .
" Actually , we 're pretty busy this year , " said Manager Heather Polzin .
" People are getting less gallons during the week than they had to get , but it 's not too bad . "
After effects
Unfortunately , fees and taxes only are the tip of the iceberg , Weglarz said .
Gasoline retailers also are suffering from lower sales of items such as cigarettes , food and beverages because customers have less money to spend .
Delivery companies , whether they sell T - shirts or hardware , are paying more for gas and therefore charging customers more for their goods .
" Retailers are getting clobbered from all different directions , even stores that do n't sell gasoline , " Weglarz said .
" We 're asking our members to cut costs at all possibilities , because if you sell gasoline at a loss , you 're going out of business . "
Furthermore , each abandoned station has an underground storage tank , Weglarz said , that eventually will leak unless it is cleaned up .
" There 's no money to do cleanup because the retailer 's probably gone bankrupt and the state keeps redirecting the money from the underground storage tank fund to the general fund , " he said .
" That 's a dirty little secret that most people are n't aware of . "
Salesforce.com ‘s strategy can be boiled down to one word , according to chief executive Marc Benioff — love .
Of course , Benioff was being a little tongue - in - cheek as he answered questions from analysts and reporters at today ’s Dreamforce conference in San Francisco .
But he was illustrating a real argument about how Salesforce.com might beat software giant Microsoft in the cloud computing market .
As with its other offerings , Microsoft ’s new cloud - computing application platform , Windows Azure , is all about tying people into Microsoft products and services , Benioff said .
Salesforce , on the other hand , is much more about being open and cooperative , both in its customer relationship management ( CRM ) services , and in Force.com , its platform for business applications .
Salesforce is interested in connecting multiple clouds , platforms and devices — witness today ’s announcement that Force.com will integrate with the Facebook platform and Amazon Web Services , or Salesforce ’s integration of Google Apps earlier this year .
Comparing Microsoft and Salesforce , Benioff said : “ They hate everybody and we love everybody , and that ’s pretty much the difference .
We even love Microsoft . …
This is our core strategy , love . ”
When an audience member pressed Benioff on his touted openness , Benioff emphasized that he ’s talking about cooperation with other companies , not open source , per se .
He also acknowledged that Force.com has its closed aspects , namely the fact that if you build an application on Force.com , you can connect it to other platforms , but you ca n’t fully move it to another cloud .
“ Portability of code is just not something we have gotten to in our industry , ” Benioff said .
He cited Apple ’s App Store as a platform that ’s closed to a certain extent ( now that ’s an understatement ) but is thriving anyway .
Benioff also talked about why Salesforce is integrating with Facebook first , rather than another networking site , particularly business - oriented network Linked In .
Force.com plans to add LinkedIn and MySpace integration eventually , but Facebook ’s users and platform infrastructure made it an obvious first choice .
Lastly , Benioff took some questions about how Salesforce will be responding to the declining economy .
The common theme :
We ’re going to stick to our game plan .
For example , Oracle chief executive Larry Ellison has said the downturn presents an opportunity to acquire companies at bargain rates , but Benioff said he has no plans to change Salesforce ’s acquisition strategy .
Another questioner pointed out that some of the vendors who sell apps to extend Salesforce ’s capabilities will go out of business in the downturn , which could be bad for Salesforce ’s customers .
Benioff responded that Salesforce has always tried to provide “ bridges ” for its customers , so they are n’t hurt when a vendor goes out of business .
“ The way I think about this is very very simple , ” he said .
“ We do n’t want to make a lot of material changes to our business right now . ”
Good - bye , Large Hadron Collider .
Hello , Black Mesa .
That 's the reader 's choice in Wired Science 's Large Hadron Collider Renaming Contest , announced last week to fill the vast gulf between the LHC 's scientific magnificence and utterly wonky name .
Since then , an electrical problem has shuttered the mammoth atom smasher until 2009 – making Black Mesa , a reference to the bestselling computer game Half Life , a timely choice .
It wo n't take long for delays and malfunctions to sour the public on their $ 8 - billion Large Hadron Collider , but Black Mesa sounds scary and intimidating , like a leaked government project .
Criticize it , and you 'll end up on a watch list .
Black Mesa was submitted separately by Brian Reed and DSA .
Finishing second was the Chuck Norris Roundhouse Kick Simulator , submitted by Anonymous .
Among my favorite also - rans were Master Blaster Atom Smasher ; Atom Smasher +5 , Holy Avenger ; What Willis Was Talking About ; The Big Banger ; and The Thing We Play With When We Are n't Playing Warcraft .
All these entries are better than the winner of the Royal Society of Chemistry 's winner : Halo .
The least - favorite choice in our contest was The Blesser , submitted by Vincenzo Maggio .
Its sheer unpopularity was likely due to its religious overtones , but at this point , the LHC can use a bit of help , divine or not .

CHICAGO – Paul Volcker , who helped tame runaway inflation during the 1980s during two terms as chairman of the Federal Reserve , has agreed to lead a new White House economic advisory committee for President - elect Barack Obama .
Mr. Obama made the announcement on Wednesday morning at his third news conference in as many days .
The public appearances by the president - elect are intended to show Americans that his team is focusing on resolving the financial crisis .
Mr. Volcker , 81 , has been providing Mr. Obama advice on the economy for months .
After briefly considering him for Treasury secretary , Mr. Obama instead asked Mr. Volcker to lead the President ’s Economic Recovery Advisory Board , a panel comprised of officials from a variety of business sectors .
The group is tasked with providing Mr. Obama advice for how to jumpstart the economy and stabilize the financial markets .
Austan Goolsbee , a University of Chicago economist who was a leading economic adviser to the Obama presidential campaign , will be the top staff member of the advisory board , Mr. Obama announced .
Mr. Volcker was appointed chairman of the Federal Reserve in August 1979 as President Jimmy Carter fought to battle inflation .
Mr. Volcker , who served in that position until 1987 , often used tactics that were unpopular as he unleashed interest rates .
Criticized at the time for causing a recession , he later was praised for his efforts .

A brown haze of soot , particles and chemicals that hangs over parts of Asia is darkening cities , melting glaciers in the Himalayas and making weather systems more extreme , the United Nations said Thursday .
Scientists who have studied the thick brown clouds , which they estimate to be more than three kilometres thick , said the haze stretches from the Arabian Peninsula to China and the Western Pacific Ocean .
It is officially known as atmospheric brown clouds .
The scientists , who come from China , India , Europe and the U.S. , said in a new report commissioned by the UN Environment Program that the brown clouds are aggravating the impact of climate change caused by greenhouse gases in some regions .
They said they are issuing the warning now about the brown haze because it is a " serious and significant " environmental challenge facing the planet that poses a threat to human health and food production .
" Imagine for a moment a three - kilometer - thick band of soot , particles , a cocktail of chemicals that stretches from the Arabic Peninsula to Asia , " Achim Steiner , UN undersecretary general and executive director of the program , said during a news conference on the findings .
" All of this points to an even greater and urgent need to look at emissions across the planet , because this is where the stories are linked in terms of greenhouse emissions and particle emissions and the impact that they 're having on our global climate , " he said .
The brown clouds have darkened 13 cities in Asia , including Beijing , Shanghai , Bangkok , Cairo , Mumbai , New Delhi and Tehran , " dimming " sunlight in some places by as much as 25 per cent .
The brown clouds , produced by the burning of fossil fuels , wood and plants , form particles like black carbon and soot that absorb sunlight and warm the air , enhancing the greenhouse effect .
Mask for warming impact
Scientists , however , said the brown clouds also " mask " the warming impacts of climate change by an average of 40 per cent because they contain particles that reflect sunlight and cool the earth 's surface .
According to the report , the phenomenon has been studied closely in Asia , but it is not unique to the region , with brown clouds seen over parts of North America , Europe , southern Africa and the Amazon Basin .
The scientists said the brown clouds are having a negative impact on air quality and agricultural production in Asia with risks to human health increasing .
Health problems associated with the brown clouds include cardiovascular and respiratory diseases .
Veerabhadran Ramanathan , head of the scientific panel that is carrying out the research and a professor at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California in San Diego , said the huge cloud masses can cross continents in the space of three to four days .
It 's not a regional issue , but a global one , he said .
" The main message is that it 's a global problem .
This is not a problem where we point fingers at our neighbours .
Everyone is in someone else 's backyard , " Ramanathan said .
He said one of most serious problems noted in the report is melting of the Hindu Kush - Himalaya - Tibetan glaciers , which provide the head - waters for the major river systems including the Ganges , Brahmaputra , Mekong and Yangtze rivers .
The Ganges basin , for example , is home to more than 400 million people and holds 40 per cent of India 's irrigated croplands .
He said the melting has " serious implications for the water and food security of Asia . "
The Chinese Academy of Sciences estimates that the glaciers have shrunk five per cent since the 1950s and the volume of China 's nearly 47,000 glaciers has fallen by 3,000 square kilometres over the past quarter century .
The brown clouds also have helped decrease the monsoon season in India .
The weather extremes caused by the clouds may have also helped to reduce production of crops such as rice , wheat and soybean , according to the report .
Ramanathan said he hopes the report " triggers " an international response to the problems of greenhouse gases and brown clouds and the " unsustainable development " that underlies them both .
" The new research , by identifying some of the causal factors , offers hope for taking actions to slow down this disturbing phenomenon , " he said .
Telco immunity faces first court challenge Nick Juliano
Published : Friday October 17 , 2008
Print This Email This Plaintiffs suing AT&T and other telecommunications companies filed a lengthy motion in court this week arguing the government could not retroactively invalidate their lawsuit because its immunity authority is unconstitutional and destroys the notion of coequal branches of government .
Last month , the government moved to dismiss all lawsuits against telecommunications companies based on authority granted to the Attorney General in this summer 's update to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act .
Responding to that motion Thursday , plaintiffs argue that the " novel and unprecedented scheme " outlined in the FISA update would usurp the concept of judicial review , while flying in the face of privacy protections enshrined in the constitution .
The immunity section of the FISA Amendments
Act gives the Attorney General the authority to dismiss civil lawsuits against phone and Internet providers who abetted warrantless surveillance on the grounds that the surveillance was authorized by the president and that the phone companies were told it was legal .
" That is a just a bare and unconstitutional act that for which there simply is no precedent whatsoever , " Harvey Grossman , an American Civil Liberties Union representing the plaintiffs , tells RAW STORY .
" Congress simply does n't have the power to rewrite the 4th amendment . "
A 61 - page filing argues that Congress does n't have the authority to issue a retroactive immunity statute , that immunity violates separation of powers by improperly inflating executive branch authority , that immunity violates individuals rights to due process , that the secrecy provisions of immunity violate the First Amendment by creating a " chilling effect " on free speech , and that the government has not justified dismissing the telecom lawsuits even if its ability to do so was constitutional .
At stake are the privacy rights of every American who trusts and uses the communication facilities of AT&T , MCI , Verizon , BellSouth , Cingular , or Sprint to transmit their most private and important thoughts .
But also at stake is something equally fundamental the role of the Judiciary in the constitutional structure of our government .
For if Congress can give the Executive the power to exclude the Judiciary from considering the constitutional claims of millions of Americans , can abdicate to the Executive the authority to change the law applicable in specific litigation , and can prevent the Judiciary from making an independent determination of the facts and law in specific litigation , then the Judiciary will no longer be functioning as a co-equal branch of government .
The Electronic Frontier Foundation and American Civil Liberties Union are representing plaintiffs in the various telecom lawsuits the government is attempting to dismiss .
" The immunity law puts the fox in charge of the hen house , letting the Attorney General decide whether or not telecoms like AT&T can be sued for participating in the government 's illegal warrantless surveillance , " EFF Senior Staff Attorney Kevin Bankston said in a news release .
" In our constitutional system , it is the judiciary 's role as a co-equal branch of government to determine the scope of the surveillance and rule on whether it is legal , not the executive's .
The Attorney General should not be allowed to unconstitutionally play judge and jury in these cases , which affect the privacy of millions of Americans . "
Thursday 's filing in the US District Court for the Northern District of California meticulously outlines its arguments , relying on dozens of cases dating back to the 1803 decision in Marbury v. Madison , which first established the principal of judicial review .
Plaintiffs also argue that Congress 's attempt to imbue the executive branch with nearly unfettered authority to decide whether its actions are constitutional is at odds with this year 's Supreme Court decision in Boumediene v. Bush , which struck down Congress and the Bush administration 's attempts to deny habeas corpus rights to Guantanamo detainees .
When , however , Congress and the Executive have left open no path for adequate judicial review of constitutional claims , the Court has not hesitated to strike down the obstructions to judicial review the political branches have erected .
The Supreme Court did so just last term in Boumediene v. Bush , when it affirmed that Guantanamo detainees have the right to full judicial adjudication of their constitutional claims notwithstanding the attempts of Congress and the Executive to keep those claims out of court .
At issue in Boumediene were the Military Commissions Act ( MCA ) and the Detainee Treatment Act ( DTA ) , in which Congress prohibited habeas corpus review of the legality of the detention of the detainees .
The Court held that the detainees were entitled to some form of judicial review of their constitutional claims .
Plaintiffs hope the courts will reach a similar decision to strike down the FISA Amendments Act .
As RAW STORY has previously reported , EFF and the ACLU began preparing their legal challenges to immunity and other aspects of the FISA Amendments
Act even before Congress put its final stamp of approval on President Bush 's demands for immunity in July .
Thursday 's filing is the first direct court challenge to retroactive immunity .
It comes after several broader , parallel attempts to stop the National Security Agency 's warrantless wiretapping program in court .
EFF has a separate suit it filed last month targeting the NSA directly , rather than the telecoms , and the ACLU filed its own challenge this summer to the provisions of FISA update aside from telecom immunity .
" This is a bad law , hotly contested , that is more the product of election year politics than it is reasoned and seasoned policy judgement , " Grossman said in a phone interview Friday .
" I 'm hopeful that a new congress and a new president will reexamine what ' they 've done here . "
Almost two miles beneath the earth 's surface in a South African goldmine , researchers have found a new species of bacteria that lives in total isolation from any other organism .
The discovery offers the first known example of an ecosystem that is n't a complex web of different life forms , but is instead hosts just one self - sufficient species .
The bacteria , Desulforudis audaxviator , is able to extract all its food and energy directly from the surrounding water and rocks , and researchers say the independent microbe offers a glimpse of the shape life could take on other planets .
Researchers wanted to know what organisms were living in the mine 's deep fissures , a habitat completely devoid of light and oxygen , so they analyzed the genes present in a water sample to determine what species lived there .
They filtered a total of 5,600 liters of mine water to get their sample , which gave other microbes plenty of opportunities to make themselves known .
Of the DNA sequences obtained from this sample , over 99.9 percent were from this single species ; over half of the remainder were obvious contaminants from their own lab [ Ars Technica ] .
The study , published in Science [ subscription required ] , has piqued the interest of astrobiologists who say that extraterrestrial life could resemble this bacteria .
" One question that has arisen when considering the capacity of other planets to support life is whether organisms can exist independently , without access even to the Sun , " says [ lead researcher Dylan ] Chivian .
" The answer is yes and here 's the proof . " ... Chris McKay , of NASA 's Ames Research Center says that D. audaxviator is an amazing discovery , and represents the kind or organism that could survive below the surface of Mars or Saturn 's sixth largest moon Enceladus [ New Scientist ] .
D. audaxviator derives energy from the radioactive decay of uranium in surrounding rocks and gets carbon and nitrogen , two of the building blocks of life , either from dissolved gases or by cannibalizing other bacteria .
Jules Verne ’s novel Journey to the Center of the Earth inspired part of the name — Candidatus Desulforudis audaxviator — the scientists gave to the newly discovered bacterium ....
Audaxviator is Latin for “ bold traveler , ” from a passage in Verne ’s book that translates to “ Descend , bold traveler … and you will attain the center of the Earth ” [ Science News ] .

Traditional forms of soy such as natto , tempeh , miso and soy sauce have been consumed for centuries .
The really important key to why these foods are healthy is because they are naturally fermented foods .
As such they aid in preventing and reducing diseases such as heart disease and different types of cancer .
For example miso is a fermented probiotic form of soyabean rich in isoflavones believed to be cancer chemopreventatives .
Unsurprisingly , a number of years ago , the World Health Organization announced the Japanese to be the longest lived of any people on earth .
At this point you could be forgiven for wondering why the title of this article is Why Soy is Not a Health Food .
The Balanced Picture
The fact is nonfermented soy found in many processed foods in the west including soymilk and tofu are not the same products as their traditional fermented counterparts .
Similar to unsprouted grains unfermented soy contains phytic acid .
This anti-nutrient substance binds to nutrients in the digestive system and inhibits their absorption .
In comparison fermented soy , like sprouted grain , has no phytic acid effect and because it is fermented contains probiotics .
These good bacteria serve to increase the quantity , availability , digestibility and assimilation of vital nutrients .
So soy in the form of traditional fermented soy is really good for you .
Large amounts of soy in the processed unfermented form you ’re most likely eating quite simply is not .
Although the American Heart Association ( AHA ) originally supported the FDA health claim regarding soy the AHA expert committee ’s subsequent examination of the evidence lead the AHA to conclude that soy protein does not reliably lower cholesterol and does not prevent heart disease – read about this here .
Worse , both soy protein isolate and soy protein concentrate have been found to contain glutamate .
One of the potent excitotoxins I wrote about recently ( source : Blaylock , R. , The Taste That Kills , 1996 ) .
But what if you do n’t eat tofu , soy snacks or drink soymilk ?
Unfortunately you are likely consuming soy whether you ’re buying soy products or not .
That is if you eat processed food .
You see processed foods contain soybean oil and lecithin .
Dr. Joseph Hibbeln at the National Institutes of Health estimates that soybeans , usually in the form of oil , account for an astonishing 10 percent of our total calories in the United States ( source : CNN )
What Can You Do About It ?
The most obvious solution is to avoid processed food .
Instead buy and prepare your own whole foods .
You can also inform yourself about the many different names unfermented processed soy masquerades under in ingredients lists .
There is a report called Where The Soys Are which you might find helpful .
As always be sure to read your labels !
My aim when I decided to write this article was to present a balanced view of soy .
I wanted to alert you to the very real differences between healthy traditional fermented soy and processed unfermented soy and soy products in processed foods .
They are far from one and the same thing .
As always here at Balanced Existence I highly urge you to take control of your own health .
That means doing your own reading so that you can make informed decisions for yourself .
You might like to start by reading the Western A Price Foundation submission to the FDA regarding soy and the American Heart Association findings already linked to above .

Since the slide into its current crisis began 30 years ago , GM ’s products have been criticized for their lack of quality and for falling short of the competition .
Over the past few years , the beleaguered automaker has launched several vehicles that are near or at the top of their respective classes , but the car - buying public ’s perception of GM still lags behind Toyota ’s sterling reputation .
So here we submit for your approval two cars from GM that are good enough to topple a couple of Toyota ’s finest .
But are two products enough to save a company in crisis ?
Are two products enough to stem the tide of 30 - plus years of mediocrity ?
CHEVY VERSUS TOYOTA
Completely redesigned for 2008 , the Chevrolet Malibu was such a watershed vehicle that we promptly placed it on our 10 Best Cars list .
The handsome new exterior styling grabbed us , the much - improved interior satisfied us , and the newfound refinement and genteel road manners won most of us over .
Next to the Malibu that preceded it , the new car seems to be from a completely different company , one actually interested in besting the competition .
Feel No Pain
It did n’t take long for us to throw the Malibu to the sharks of its segment .
In our March 2008 comparison test of four - cylinder family sedans , the Malibu took on the Dodge Avenger , Toyota Camry , Hyundai Sonata , Honda Accord , and Nissan Altima .
The Malibu finished behind the perennial 10 Best - winning Honda Accord and the sporty and fun - to - drive Nissan Altima , but it did finish ahead of everything else — including the darling of car buyers , the Toyota Camry .
Next to its rivals , we found the Camry to be too soft and — to borrow from Pink Floyd — too comfortably numb .
Think of the Camry as a car shot full of Novocain :
It wo n’t hurt , but nothing fun ever happens when you ’re numbed up .
A pain - free experience could be enough for buyers needing mere transportation , but it is n’t enough for us .
Lively and Alive
The Malibu , in contrast , comes across as more alive than the Camry and does so without feeling raw .
The 173 - hp four - cylinder engine is hushed as it goes about its business , and the suspension and the structure have a refined and solid feel .
When hustled , the Malibu feels stable and never out of its element .
An examination of performance numbers reveals that the Camry and the Malibu are nearly identical , but subjectively , our entire comparo crew enjoyed driving the Malibu more because of its communicative chassis and solid feel .
Put simply , the Malibu drives better than the Camry .
We did criticize the Malibu for weighing more than the competition and for only having a four - speed automatic .
The weight issue remains for 2009 , but the four - cylinder is now available with a six - speed automatic on all but the most basic trim level , which improves fuel economy and acceleration .
Selling to the Wary
Through October of this year , Malibu sales are above 151,000 , still far shy of the 386,000 Camrys that Toyota sold in the same period .
Toyota actually sells nearly as many Prius hybrids as Chevy sells Malibus .
We think the Malibu is better than the Camry , but we ca n’t blame the public for being skeptical of the Malibu .
After all , our staff was n’t unanimous in voting it onto the 10 Best Cars list .
It takes time to erase distrust , among auto journalists and the public at large .
And with GM losing billions , the company might just be running out of time to convince car buyers .

I am a firm believer in the idea that reading a book is better than watching a film , because it allows your own imagination to make marvelous worlds and characters .
Nevertheless , I concede that on a number of occasions , a film director has managed to take a great book and make it an even greater movie – sometimes it is better for us to watch the creations of someone else ’s imagination .
This is a list of ten such movies .

8 Jaws Steven Spielberg , 1975
Original Story By : Peter Benchley

He is thwarted in his efforts by the town ’s mayor who finally relents when nothing else seems to work and the chief , a scientist , and an old fisherman with revenge on his mind take to the sea to kill the beast .
Jaws was a bestselling book for Peter Benchley , but it took the force of a movie to frighten generations away from the beaches !
Interesting Fact :
After the shark was built , it was never tested in the water , and when it was put in the water at Martha ’s Vineyard , it sank straight to the ocean floor .
It took a team of divers to retrieve it .

Interesting Fact : Initially there were queries over whether William Wyler was the right director for the job , as he ’d never tackled a film of this scale before .
One of the doubters was Wyler himself .

1 Stand By Me Rob Reiner , 1986
Original Story By : Stephen King ( The Body , a short story in the book Different Seasons )
Based on Stephen King ’s short story “ The Body ” , “ Stand By Me ” tells the tale of Gordie Lachance , a writer who looks back on his preteen days when he and three close friends went on their own adventure to find the body of a kid their age who had gone missing and presumed dead .
The stakes are upped when the bad kids in town are closely tailing – and it becomes a race to see who ’ll be able to recover the body first .
That such a great film can be made from a mere short story says a lot about Reiner ’s excellent directing skills .
Both this , and Shawshank Redemption ( also by Stephen King ) rate in the IMDB top 250 .
Considering that Different Seasons was a rather mediocre book compared to some of King ’s great books ( such as The Stand ) , make these two films clear winners for this list .
Interesting Fact :
At the insistence of director Rob Reiner ( an avid non-smoker who campaigned for anti-smoking laws in California ) , the cigarettes smoked by the boys were made from cabbage leaves .

Peeling sticky tape emits X - rays strong enough to scan a human finger , a remarkable experiment has shown .
US researchers used a motorised peeling machine to unwind a roll of Scotch tape at a rate of 3 cm per second .
By placing their apparatus in a vacuum , they measured X - rays strong enough to X - ray a human digit , according to a report in Nature journal .
It is well known that unwinding sticky tape produces sparks of light that can be seen in the dark by the naked eye .
This phenomenon , known as " triboluminescence " , is produced by the friction generated when two surfaces rub against each other .
The study , by Carlos Camara and Juan Escobar , of the University of California , Los Angeles , USA , provides evidence for the phenomenon , which was first observed more than 50 years ago .
A fuller version of the video can be seen on the Nature website
Now that the big five investment banks of America have been shut down , sold off or turned into more staid bank holding companies , there is one big risk - taking banker left : the federal government .
The decision this week to put $ 250 billion in banks in return for shares will make the government a major investor , and owner , in the banking industry .
The bold move is one of many that is redefining and enlarging Washington ’s role in the country ’s banking system .
Especially if conditions worsen , further government actions may be deemed necessary to shelter banks , businesses and consumers from the financial turmoil .
This fundamental shift at least raises long - term questions about government ’s appropriate role in financing and the economy .
Will the government inevitably be tempted to guide lending decisions , steering loans to some and not to others ?
History shows that government intervention in banking systems can carry its own dangers , with money funneled to political favorites instead of an economy ’s innovators .
The federal government ’s initiatives are all carefully cast as emergency measures that will be phased out in months or years .
“ It ’s explicitly temporary , but we do n’t really know where this crisis ends yet , ” said Robert E. Litan , an economist at the Brookings Institution .
“ The logic of intervention is that the more ownership the government has , the greater the regulation and management control . ”
As in the previous presidential debate , a group of undecided voters are gathered together in a swing state , this time they are from Colorado .
To get a true gauge of their reactions and feeling about the candidates - they are polled before and after the town hall debate .
This group was comprised of 50 voters , mainly former Bush supporters , but split evenly between party lines .
The voters awarded Obama the “ win ” ( 38 % to 30 % , with the rest choosing no clear winner ) .
But that result was actually the least useful of the evening .
Because while the earlier debate did not result in any net change in support for the two candidates , Obama walked away with a clear lead in new voters tonight .
After the debate ended , 26 % of the audience had become McCain supporters while 42 % said they planned to vote for Obama .
Only a quarter of the group was still undecided .
Even more dramatic was the shift in the voters ’ personal reactions to the two candidates .
Before the debate , McCain had a 48/46 favorability rating ; that improved to 56/36 by the end .
But that ’s about where Obama started the evening - 54/36 .
After an hour and a half , Obama ’s favorability numbers were 80 / 14 .
As Joe Biden would say , let me repeat that : 80 % of the undecided voters had favorable views of Obama and only 14 % saw him negatively for a net rating of +66 .
Not even Bill Clinton got such a warm response in town hall formats .
Republicans are good for throwing out the word “ liberal ” to see if it sticks or elicits the response they are looking for , which is negativity .
That did n’t work last night , for one , Obama is hardly the most liberal Senator .
He is viewed by most as a moderate .
As McCain would say , look at his voting record .
Obama also improved his standing on several key attributes .
Only 38 % of voters thought he “ has what it takes to be president ” before the debate but by the end he had convinced more than half the room ( 56 % ) .
One of McCain ’s goals for the evening was to convince viewers that Obama was a liberal who would raise their taxes and hike spending , but the number of voters who thought Obama was “ too liberal ” actually decreased throughout the evening .
That could be because Obama used tougher foreign policy rhetoric than Americans are used to hearing from Democratic nominees .
But he also got an assist from McCain , whose efforts to make him seem risky instead often position him as more hawkish than McCain .
If viewers come away from the debate thinking Obama will do more to go after bin Laden and al Qaeda than McCain would , that ’s probably a plus for Democrats .
And it makes it harder for the “ liberal ” charge to stick .
One final note , at the end , when Obama and McCain were working the room with their wives - did you see Obama moved towards McCain ?
It looked like he was going to exchange a few words or a handshake .
McCain pointed to his wife , telling Obama to shake Cindy ’s hand .
McCain then turned away .
In my opinion , that was extremely rude - and unsportsmanlike conduct .
No wonder the other Republicans do not like him , he does n’t play well with others ..

The U.S. Forest Service on Friday announced a new plan to address the problem of climate change in relation to wildfires .
[ social_buttons ]
“ The health and resilience of America ’s forests affect everyone , ” said Gail Kimbell , the U.S. Forest Service Chief , while speaking at the National Convention of the Society of American Foresters .
“ The goal is to respond to climate change broadly , from helping forests adapt to warmer , drier conditions to reducing the agency ’s carbon footprint by stepping up its purchase of alternative fuel vehicles . ”
Kimbell continued to say that he attributes the growing number of wildfires across the country to climate change .
The Society of American Foresters is the nation ’s leading scientific and educational organization for the forestry profession .
Its Reno conference , titled “ Forestry in a Climate of Change , ” brought together forestry professionals and academics .
John Helms , past president of the Society of American Foresters , and retired UC Berkeley forestry professor , offered his opinion too .
“ The problem is not climate change , ” he said .
“ The problem is the rate of climate change .
We are increasing the rate of change faster than normal evolutionary processes . ”
The plan , titled the “ Strategic Framework for Climate Change , ” relies heavily on science to shape agency decisions and calls for developing strategies to help forests soak up and store more carbon dioxide , the atmospheric gas most responsible for global warming .
But so far , the plan is somewhat loosely worded and gives few specifics .

A good Oktoberfest beer is a masterpiece of balance and integration , delicious without being extravagant .
It does its job in the background , refreshing the palate with enough flavor to pique the interest without interfering with the conversation , the dancing , the ravenous consumption of pork or the other typical Oktoberfest activities .
In our tasting we found many well - made beers that fulfilled the Oktoberfest imperative .
We were especially happy with the American beers , which stuck closely to the traditional style .
Our top three beers , all American , are excellent examples of the style .
The No. 1 beer , Octoberfest from Thomas Hooker , was beautifully balanced with each flavor component melding into a delicious , refreshing whole .
If you ponder each sip , as we did in our tasting , you might remark on the malt aromas or the way the bitterness of the hops contributes to a clean , crisp feeling in the mouth after you swallow .
But if you are polishing off a bottle at a party , or simply having a conversation with a friend or watching a ballgame , you would simply notice how enjoyable the beer was and reach for another .
The No. 2 beer , the Festbier from Victory , was similarly balanced with a barely noticeable touch of licorice among the flavors , while our No. 3 , the Dogtoberfest Marzen from Flying Dog , was a trifle more assertive , without overdoing it .
Three of the German beers made our top 10 , including two of the Munich six .
The Paulaner Oktoberfest - Märzen had a bit more complexity than some of the other beers , along with an unusual floral quality .
While the aroma seemed quite sweet , there was no sweetness on the palate .
The Hacker - Pschorr Original Oktoberfest was , as were all of our favorites , well balanced , with slightly more richness than the Paulaner but less complexity .

We all know not to serve static media ( images , CSS , Javascript , etc. ) in production directly from Django .
Thankfully , Django gives us some nice settings like MEDIA_URL and MEDIA_ROOT to make serving them a lot less painless .
Lately , however , I ’ve come to realize that these settings should n’t really apply to all static media .
Not All Static Media Is Created Equal
Static media really comes in two flavors .
Media that is part of your site like your stylesheets and user generated media or files that are uploaded to the site once it is live .
We do n’t want to serve all this media from the same place for a couple of reasons :
Our source checkouts should n’t be crufted up by stuff our users are uploading User generated content and source code should live in two different places on the filesystem
We could fix the first problem with some . gitignore , but that does n’t solve the filesystem issue .
Solution : Segregate Your Static Files
The answer is to segregate your static files .
Django already does this with ADMIN_MEDIA_PREFIX .
We use two additional settings in our Django projects , STATIC_URL and STATIC_ROOT .
This lets us put user generated content in MEDIA_ROOT outside our project while still serving STATIC_ROOT from inside our source repo .
Implementation
We use Nginx as a front - end proxy to most of our sites and add this stanza to serve all our static media :
location /s/ { alias /var/www/domainname.com / ; }
Then we add three directories to / var/www/domainname.com / :
admin , a symlink to django / contrib / admin/ media
, a symlink to static , a symlink pointing inside our project repo respectively
, a symlink pointing inside our project repo respectively media , a new folder that stores all the user generated content .
Our project settings file looks like this now :
MEDIA_ROOT = '/var/www/domainname.com/media/'
MEDIA_URL = '/ s/media /'
STATIC_ROOT = '/ path/to/project_src/static/'
STATIC_URL = '/s/static /'
ADMIN_MEDIA_PREFIX = '/s/admin/'
and we slap the following code into our urls .py to serve media during development :
from django.conf import settings if getattr ( settings , ' LOCAL_DEV ' , False ) : urlpatterns += patterns ( 'django.views.static ' , ( r '^ %s ( ? P< path >.* ) ' % settings .
STATIC_URL , ' serve ' , {' document_root ' : settings .
STATIC_ROOT} ) , ( r '^ %s ( ? P< path > . * ) ' % settings .
MEDIA_URL , ' serve ' , {' document_root ' : settings .
MEDIA_ROOT} ) , ) </ path ></ path >
This has worked very well for us , how do you tackle the issue ( or is it not an issue to you ) ?

This is a Bond adventure that 's badder , better but not bigger .
Clocking in at one and three - quarter hours , it 's a good half hour shorter than 007's previous outing .
And its reduced running time results in a leaner , tauter experience .
Picking up shortly after the end of Casino Royale when Bond confronted the mysterious Mr White , Quantum of Solace quickly throws him into a round - the - globe hunt .
Bond is trying to track down the shadowy organisation whom he holds responsible for the death of Vesper - the woman he loved and who died at the end of the last movie .
And that leads him to sinister bad guy Dominic Greene , played by Mathieu Amalric .
Emotional progression
So far , so familiar .
But what this film does differently is to focus closely on an emotionally battered Bond , his mission and his motivation .
There are odd moments of uncertainty when the film tries to juggle Bond 's personal story with the ambitious plans being pursued by Greene .
Bond 's enemy is played by Frenchman Mathieu Amalric
But for the most part the villainy rightly takes a back seat to Bond 's emotional journey .
007's mission may be what drives the film 's plot , but the real interest lies in how Bond deals with the individuals and situations he meets along the way .
That 's not to say that the film jettisons all the things that have characterised the previous stories .
There are broad nods to Goldfinger especially , but this film manages the difficult task of moving the franchise into interesting new areas .
The raw nature of the film may put off some who yearn for the days of gizmos , gadgets and Bond quips as he dispenses with faceless opponents .
Supporting cast
And it's a brave step to push even further a lot of the themes developed in Casino Royale , especially the rediscovery of who Bond is , and why he is the way he is .
It 's a film that feels like the second part of a trilogy , with this being the bleaker second act .
Daniel Craig is accompanied by actress Olga Kurylenko
For a lot of the movie Bond is a particularly unsympathetic character , and often it 's only Craig 's performance along with the shifting morality of Bond 's legion of enemies that forces the audience to root for him .
Olga Kurylenko , who plays a refreshingly different kind of female companion , does well with a part that has far more depth than most Bond girls .
And Gemma Arterton is superb in her brief role as an agent whom Bond encounters in Bolivia , cementing her position as one of cinema 's brightest young stars .
As ever the end credits promise that James Bond will return , and thanks to Quantum of Solace , the sense of anticipation for this should be particularly high .
Not to see what super villain Bond will be battling , but to discover what the next stage will be in a character that Daniel Craig has managed to reinvent and develop movie by movie .
Quantum of Solace opens on 31 October .

Slowly but surely , iPhone versions of popular Web applications are coming in ; I do n't doubt that in a year 's time you 'll be hard pressed to find one that does n't have its iPhone counterpart .
The latest app to adorn your iPhone screen is Google Earth , the virtual 3D world atlas we 've learned to love on our desktops .
Like all other iPhone applications , it 's available through the applications store ; it started rolling in on Sunday and is now available for almost everyone , depending on your time zone .
The interesting question about this application is , of course , how did Google take advantage of iPhone 's capabilities when they created the interface for the app , and the answer is : beautifully .
Besides the standard panning and multitouch zooming , you can tilt your iPhone to change the viewing angle or switch it to horizontal view to see a wider picture .
Furthermore , both Wikipedia and Panoramio layers of bookmarks are included ( you can turn them on and off in the settings ) , and offline mode also works .
if you continue using the application without being connected to a network , it will use cached imagery you 've previously viewed .
Finally , there 's the standard search , available through an icon in the upper left corner , which works pretty much like in the desktop version .
Take a look at the video presentation of Google Earth for iPhone in the video below .

Other Wal - Mart employees tried to help Mr. Damour but the crowd kept rushing in like salmon swimming upstream to spawn .
Shoppers simply stepped over his body and witnesses even said that some people continued shopping even after the incident was announced !

In Desert Hot Springs , two people were killed when they had a shootout in a Toys R Us store :
“ ( LA Times ) Joan Barrick , 40 , of Desert Hot Springs said she was buying a Barbie Jeep for her daughter when two women started brawling .
As the women swung at each other , the men they were with also started arguing .
The younger of the two lifted up his shirt and flashed his handgun , pulling the grip from his baggy pants pocket .
The other man yanked out his own handgun and started chasing him down the aisle and firing , witnesses said .
Barrick hid behind a stack of DVDs and recited the Lord ’s Prayer .
“ If I ’m going to die , I need to make peace , ” she said .
“ A lot of people were crying .
I was crying .
We were all very , very scared . ”
What a sad state of affairs .
In early reports , it looks like people somehow defied the laws of financial logic and are spending in droves .
Of course , it is much too early to gather figures but the fact that we are even discussing “ brisk and strong ” sales is astounding .
People are rushing out to buy Guitar Hero and Grand Theft Auto to indoctrinate a generation in mindless drivel .
Think of Grand Theft Auto .
You play the role of a criminal who car jacks innocent bystanders and shoots police while talking with prostitutes for fun .
Is this what we are spending our money on ?
And Guitar
Hero gives people the chance to play a fake guitar and pretend to be a rock star .
Just what we need , another generation of self indulgent egomaniacs .
What ever happened to learning to play a real guitar ?
We have a large number of our population who are living fake lives .
Just look at what TV shows are popular .
All these reality shows have large audiences because people are so bored with their own lives that they need to watch the drama of others to feel alive .
And the lives of those on reality TV are n’t even real !
How twisted is that ?
We can lament about these societal issues but look at this fake economy we have built over the last decade .
A society pretending to be richer than it really is by mortgaging our own future with debt .
Then we expect that the next generation who is in a trance in front of Grand Theft Auto is going to be equipped to deal with this epic calamity ?
Time for parents and the younger generation to prioritize .
The only thing we have trained millions is to get ready for a Mad Max world which given our economic mess is n’t so far fetched .
Heck , we have tons of shiny brand new off road vehicles that are simply sitting on lots .
Nothing highlights our lack of preparation more than the big 3 automakers going down in flames .
Sure , we can argue that it was because of this credit crisis or because of legacy costs but the reality is they were outperformed by foreign competitors .
People voted with their wallets .
The big 3 bet on large expensive gas guzzling urban tanks and lost big .
Now , they are teetering on the verge of extinction like the Tyrannosaurs rex .
If the credit crisis was at fault , why are n’t Toyota and Honda on the verge of bankruptcy ?
We are at a major crossroads here .
As a society , it is time we refocus our energy on the sciences and engineering and stop thinking about how many ways we can put granite countertops in every kitchen of America .
If we are serious about staying competitive , we need to invest money in these areas .
Initially NASA was seen as a big waste but I think most Americans would rather see money invested in NASA instead of WaMu .
Yet the sad thing is even with all these pathetic bailouts , all the money is going to financial companies which are at the heart of the matter .
Take a look at the money already set aside for this mess :
* Source : Motley Fool
So far the government has spent $ 2 trillion of this amount and we can rest assured more of it will be used up since it is already committed .
I think it is important to understand the magnitude of the mess we are in and to put it into a historical perspective .
I started a series called Lessons from the Great Depression back on August 2nd of 2007 , a few days prior to the peak of the stock market .
In fact , our first article was looking at a personal letter from a lawyer from a small town recounting the destruction caused by the Great Depression .
Here are some of the comments at the time :
“ Yes , this is a housing bubble .
We ’ve survived housing crashes before and I see no reason why we could n’t survive this one .
It ’s fashionable to label every bubble crash as the next Depression .
The Internet bubble was supposed to bring a depression , so was Black Friday in Oct 87 , the OPEC problems before then .
Just b/c this is a bubble , does n’t mean the country will go to “ hell in a henbasket ” .
The U.S. will survive this like it survives everything else . ”
The reason that this was being compared to the Great Depression was the global magnitude of the problem .
The technology bubble as big as it was occurred primarily in a few nations .
It impacted a large number of people but nothing in the scope of the current credit bubble .
Here is another comment from someone who would benefit from a history lesson :
“ Um , that “ letter ” is a fake .
Anybody else catch that the author used the verb SKYROCKET ???!!!!
There were no skyrockets in 1933 !
Doh !! ”
I found the letter in an old file and typed it up since it struck me how similar our current predicament was to that of the Great Depression .
The skyrockets are referring to fireworks that of course were invented by the Chinese back in the freaking 12th century !
But how would you know that if you sit in front of the tube playing Grand Theft Auto and enjoying Dancing with the Stars and never read a book ?
I ’ve read numerous books covering the Great Depression and the similarities to our current predicament are all there .
Here is a list of a few I highly recommend that cover the history and economics of the first half of the 1900s :
Since Yesterday : Frederick Lewis Allen
Only Yesterday : Frederick Lewis Allen
The Great Crash of 1929 : John Kenneth Galbraith
Manias , Panics , and Crashes : Charles Kindleberger
The Big Change : Frederick Lewis Allen
The World in Depression 1929 – 1939 : Charles Kindleberger
Some are more academic and some are quicker reads .
Some focus on the economic aspects of the depression while others also look at the societal changes .
All these books are highly recommended and provide excellent perspectives .
You ’d also learn a lot by simply reading old Harper ’s Magazine articles during that time .
Today we are going to examine the years after the great crash .
Ben Bernanke who is a self - appointed expert on the Great Depression is having his chance of testing his hypothesis of what went wrong during the Great Depression .
As it turns out , he does n’t have the answer either .
Below I ’ll type a few important paragraphs from Since Yesterday talking about this time in history and put a sock in the mouth of anyone claiming this is the bottom .
We are nowhere close to a bottom .
This is part XXII in our Great Depression series :
16 . Items That Sold in the Credit Bubble .
17 . The All Hat and No Cattle Nation
18 . Charity for Financial Deviants .
19 . The Silent Economic Depression
20 . The Four Horsemen of the Economic Apocalypse
21 . The Big Change
Squandering Ourselves into Prosperity
“ June , 1931 : Twenty months after the Panic .
The department - store advertisements were beginning to display Eugenie hats , heralding a fashion enthusiastic but brief ; Wiley Post and Harold Gatty were preparing for their flight round the world in the monoplane “ Winnie Mae ” ; and newspaper readers were agog over the finding , on Long Beach near New York , of the dead body of a pretty girl with the singularity lyrical name of Starr Faithful . ”
“ For a long time past , as business slowed up in Europe , a sort of creeping paralysis had been afflicting European finance .
Debts – national and private – which had once seemed bearable burdens had now become intolerably heavy ; new financial credits were hardly being extended except to shore up the old ones ; prices fell , anxiety spread , and the whole system slowed almost to a standstill .
During the spring of 1931 the paralysis had become acute . ”
Keep in mind that during this time the U.S. was a creditor nation .
Even though our Great Depression was horrific , revolutions and fundamental changes came about in Europe that turned their worlds upside down .
Hitler slowly started to gain power in Germany and other economies started collapsing under unsupportable debt .
The U.S. even right after the crash , still had not faced the worst of the depression .
That was still to come and the market rallied many times even after the crash :
“ He [ President Hoover ] called the newspaper men to the White House and read them a long statement which contained both his proposal for an international moratorium and the names of 21 senators and 18 representatives who had already approved it .
The newspaper men grabbed their copies and rushed for the telephones .
When the news was flashed over the world a chorus of wild enthusiasm arose .
The stock market in New York leaped , stock markets in Europe rallied , bankers praised Hoover , editorial writers cheered ; the sedate London Economist came out with a panegyric entitled “ The Break in the Clouds ” which called the proposal “ the gesture of a great man ” ; and millions of Americans who had felt , however vaguely , that the government ought to “ do something ” and who had blamed Hoover for his inactivity , joined in the applause .
Little as they might know about the international financial situation ( which had been getting nowhere near as much space in the press as the Starr Faithful mystery ) , this was action at last and they liked it .
To the worried President ’s surprise , he had made what seemed to be a ten - strike .
It was the high moment of his Presidency .
Only the French demurred .
Hoover sent his seventy - seven - year - old Secretary of the Treasury , Andrew Mellon , to reason with them , and exhausted the old man with constant consultations by transatlantic telephone .
After a long delay – over two weeks – the French agreed to the plan with modifications , and the day appeared to have been saved .
But it was not saved at all . ”
Now contrary to popular two - second sound clips , President Hoover was trying to resolve the crisis .
He fundamentally believed in rugged individualism .
This was collapsing because of global pressures and a multitude of factors .
The crash of 1929 was only a symptom of a bigger world mess .
Now do n’t get me wrong , Hoover by all means was n’t a good President but it is important to put the situation into context .
President Coolidge was the bigger accomplice to Wall Street and history looks at him favorably because of the “ Roaring 20s . ”
Will anyone look at this decade in economic awe ?
Hoover relied on the power base which was on Wall Street and this was quickly losing its halo of power .
Plus , they were corrupt to the core just like Wall Street got during this past decade .
The market had a brief rally .
Yet fundamentally nothing had changed .
Our current rally is a dead cat bounce .
Nothing has fundamentally changed .
In fact the core items of a solid economy are failing ; production is down , unemployment is rising , prices are collapsing , and our debt is crushing us .
Are these reasons for a rally ?
“ In the month of September , 1931 , a total of 305 American banks closed ; in October , a total of 522 .
Frightened capitalists were hoarding gold now , lest the United States too should go off the gold standard ; safe - deposit boxes were being crammed full of coins , and many a mattress was stuffed with gold certificates .
American business was weakening faster than ever .
In September the United States Steel Corporation – whose President , James A. Farrell , had hitherto steadfastly refused to cut the wage - rate – announced a ten - per - cent cut ; other corporations followed ; during that autumn , all over the United States , men were coming home from the office or the factory to tell their wives that the next pay check would be a little smaller , and that they must think up new economies .
The ranks of the unemployed received new recruits ; by the end of the year their numbers were in the neighborhood of ten millions . ”
Let us take a look at the unemployment rate during this time :
Even in 1929 , unemployment was at historical lows .
In 1930 , it had jumped but it was still below 10 % .
In 1931 the rate was now hovering around 15 % .
In 1932 and 1933 the rate had hit 25 % .
This is why pundits who keep pointing to 2005 , 2006 , or 2007 are so off base .
Things can change so quickly .
Look at the massive amount of layoffs coming down the pipeline .
Citibank will layoff over 50,000 people in the next few months .
JP Morgan will layoff 19,000 from the WaMu acquisitions .
Take a look at the mass layoff announcements :
We are running at decade highs here .
A mass layoff announcement is considered when a company has 50 initial claims for unemployment insurance ( UI ) filed against them during a 5 - week period .
This is a leading indicator that things will get worse especially since we are in the early stages of this recession .
Paulson must have taken a page out of President Hoover ’s bailout manual :
“ Again Hoover acted , and again his action was financial .
Something must be done to save the American banking system , and the bankers were not doing it ; the spirit of the day was sauve qui peut .
Hoover called fifteen of the overlords of the banking world to a secret evening meeting with him and his financial aides at Secretary Mellon ’s apartment in Washington , and proposed to them that the strong banks of the country form a credit pool to help the weak ones .
When it became clear that this would not suffice – for the strong banks were taking no chances and this pool , the National Credit Corporation , lent almost no money at all – Hoover recommended the formation of a big governmental credit agency , the Reconstruction Finance Corporation , with two billion dollars to lend to banks , railroads , insurance companies .
As the winter of 1931 - 32 arrived and the run on the country ’s gold continued , and it seemed as if the United States might presently be forced off the gold standard , Hoover issued a public appeal against hoarding and then proposed an alteration in the Federal Reserve requirements which – embodied in the Glass - Steagall Act – eased this situation .
Again with the idea of improving credit conditions , he urged , and secured , the creation of a chain of home - loan discount banks , and the provision of additional capital for the Federal Land Banks .
Steadily he fought against those measures which seemed to him iniquitous : he appeared before the American Legion and appealed to the members not to ask for the immediate cash payment of the rest of their Bonus money ; he vetoed a bill for the distribution of direct Federal relief ; and again and again he made clear his opposition to any proposals for inflation or for ( in his own words ) “ squandering ourselves into prosperity . ”
Still the Depression deepened .
Already the pressure of events had pushed the apostle of rugged individualism much further toward state socialism than any previous president had gone in time of peace .
Hoover ’s Reconstruction Finance Corporation had put the government deeply into business .
But it was state socialism of a very limited and special sort .
What was happening may perhaps be summed up in this way : -
Hoover had tried to keep hands off the economic machinery of the country , to permit a supposedly flexible system to make its own adjustments of supply and demand .
At two points he had intervened , to be sure : he had tried to hold up the prices of wheat and cotton , unsuccessfully , and he had tried to hold up wage - rates , with partial and temporary success ; but otherwise he had mainly stood aside to let prices and profits and wages follow their natural course .
But no natural adjustment could be reached unless the burdens of debt could also be naturally reduced through bankruptcies .
And in America , as in other parts of the world , the economic system had now become so complex and interdependent that the possible consequences of widespread bankruptcy to banks , the insurance companies , the great holding - company systems , and the multitudes of people dependent upon them – had become too appalling to contemplate . ”
Just change a few names here and there and we are repeating history .
Even with the RFC and the notion of crony capitalism made a cameo during this time .
Now we call our junkyard the TARP .
The world was connected at that time as well .
I hear these talking head pundits acting as if during the Great Depression we were somehow savages and did n’t understand capitalism .
As if credit default swaps are some form of evolution to the system ?
Please , the system if anything is more perverted today than it was bank then .
And for executives coming to D.C. for cheese we got that going on back then as well :
“ It is also almost useless to ask whether Hoover was acting with a tory heartlessness in permitting financial executives to come to Washington for a corporate dole whne men and women on the edge of starvation were denied a personal dole .
What is certain is that at a time of such widespread suffering no democratic government could seem to be aiding the financiers and seem to be simultaneously disregarding the plight of its humbler citizens without losing the confidence of the public . ”
“ … people who had taken these fixed principles for granted , and had shown little interest in politics except for election time , began to try to educate themselves .
For not even the comparatively prosperous could any longer deny that something momentous was happening . ”
“ The autumn of 1931 brought also an outburst of laughter .
When old certainties topple , when old prophets are discredited , one can at least enjoy their downfall .
By this time people had reached the point of laughing at Oh , Yeah , a small book in which were collected the glib prophecies made by bankers and statesmen at the onset of the Depression . ”
A society who does n’t remember history is condemned to repeat it .
Our version of Oh , Yeah can be seen on satirical blogs and TV shows like the Colbert Report and the Daily Show .
At a certain point , you have to laugh at how corrupt the system has gotten .
We need to keep our spirits light because we have years of perp walks and trials that we will be going through .
So much has already been squandered that when we dig deep into the books of failed institutions , we will be stunned .
Maybe that is why the Federal Reserve does n’t want to tell us about those $ 2 trillion in loans ?
But , is n’t that our money that is being squandered ?

South African surgeons have carried out the world 's first organ transplants from one HIV - positive person to another , in a groundbreaking operation that opens the way to saving thousands of lives .
Doctors transplanted HIV - infected kidneys from a single donor into two men in late September at Groote Schuur hospital in Cape Town , where Christiaan Barnard performed the world 's first heart transplant .
The operations were not made public until it was clear they had been successful .
The South African authorities had previously blocked HIV - positive people from receiving transplants and discarded nearly a third of organs because the potential donors were carrying the virus that causes Aids - a policy criticised by some people in the medical establishment of a country where one in five adults is HIV - positive .
But the ban was lifted last year , opening the way for more operations , and possibly giving HIV - positive patients a greater chance of receiving new kidneys than those not infected with the Aids virus , because there are more potential donors .
The surgeon who performed the operations , Dr Elmi Muller , said the condition of both patients was " excellent " , the transplanted kidneys were functioning well and there were no signs of rejection .
" HIV patients are at a disadvantage when it comes to getting an organ and dialysis .
Even when we try to be fair , they are at a disadvantage competing with people with no chronic illness , " she said .
" This study opens up an opportunity to help them , even gives them a slight advantage , because of the high number of HIV - positive donors . "
Muller said that if the kidney transplants were successful in the long term it would open the way to the use of other organs such as livers , which are particularly vulnerable to damage by anti-Aids drugs , and hearts .
Nonetheless , the transplants remain controversial because they almost certainly mean that the recipient will become infected with the virus strain that infected the donor , which may be different from the one they carry and increase their resistance to anti-Aids drugs .
There are also concerns that HIV - positive organs could themselves have been damaged by the disease , making them less durable as transplants .
But news of the transplants has brought new hope to many .
Dr June Fabian , a consultant nephrologist at Johannesburg hospital , said some of her HIV - positive patients stood to benefit from accepting HIV - positive organs .
" [ If you have ] renal failure and HIV you get told to go home and die , " she said .
" HIV - positive to HIV - positive [ transplants ] come from having limited resources and knowing that the patient is going to die .
Positive to positive [ transplant ] is the last alternative .
" This offers hope for a large population of people who previously had no hope for dialysis and transplantation . "
Among those who will potentially benefit is one of Fabian 's patients , a 50 - year - old businessman who did not wish to be named .
A tough and fit man before his kidneys failed , he was diagnosed HIV positive last year .
He now does his own dialysis at home through a implant in his stomach .
Four times a day he pours a bag of fluid down a tube into his stomach , and a little while later drains it out again .
It is an improvement on the in - hospital dialysis machines he was using before .
That involved being attached to machines for four hours a day , three times a week .
" It 's better , but hectic .
You have to do the thing the whole day , there is little else you can do .
Now time is hard , it is hard to live , hard to earn something , to look after my business , " he said .
" If I can get a [ transplant ] I will be the happiest man ... I still have belief that one day I 'll get a donor . "
The transplants present special problems .
HIV - positive organ recipients will already be on drugs to boost their immune systems , but a transplant requires treatment to suppress the immune system so the new organ is not rejected .
In theory , the two sets of drugs work at cross purposes but , although doctors cannot fully explain it , international research has shown that HIV - positive people who have received organs free of the virus do as well in the long term as patients who do not have HIV .

If you ’ve ever collaborated with other people on a project , you know the frustration of constantly swapping files .
Some do it by email , some through file upload services and some by other methods .
It ’s a pain in the neck , and every designer and developer knows it .
Revision control is an excellent way to combat the problem of sharing files between workers .
If you ’ve ever collaborated with other people on a project , you know the frustration of constantly swapping files .
Some do it by email , some through file upload services and some by other methods .
It ’s a pain in the neck , and every designer and developer knows it .
Revision control is an excellent way to combat the problem of sharing files between workers .
Most web - developers have probably worked with some sort of revision control system , but designers may find it a foreign concept .
The most obvious benefit of using revision control is the ability to have an unlimited number of people working on the same code base , without having to constantly send files back and forth .
You might be interested in the following related posts :
But designers and developers can both benefit from using revision control systems to keep copies of their files and designs .
You can instantly browse previous “ commits ” to your repository and revert to earlier versions if something happens .
This article reviews some of the top open - source version control systems and tools that make setting up a version control system easy .
CVS
CVS is the grandfather of revision control systems .
It was first released in 1986 , and Google Code still hosts the original Usenet post announcing CVS .
CVS is the de facto standard and is installed virtually everywhere .
However , the code base is n’t as fully featured as SVN or other solutions .
The learning curve is n’t too steep for CVS , and it ’s a very simple system for making sure files and revisions are kept up to date .
While CVS may be an older technology , it ’s still quite useful for any designer or developer for backing up and sharing files .
Tortoise CVS is a great client for CVS on Windows , and there are many different IDEs , such as Xcode ( Mac ) , Eclipse , NetBeans and Emacs , that use CVS .
CVS Resources
SVN
Subversion is probably the version control system with the widest adoption .
Most open - source projects use Subversion as a repository because other larger projects , such as SourceForge , Apache , Python , Ruby and many others , use it as well .
Google Code uses Subversion exclusively to distribute code .
Because of Subversion ’s popularity , many different Subversion clients are available .
If you ’re a Windows user , Tortoise SVN is a great file browser for viewing , editing and modifying your Subversion code base .
If you ’re on a Mac , Versions is an elegant client that provides a “ pleasant way to work with Subversion . ”
Xcode is Apple ’s developer environment and Subversion client that ships with Leopard on a Mac .
SVN Resources
Git
Git is the new fast - rising star of version control systems .
Initially developed by Linux kernel creator Linus Torvalds , Git has recently taken the Web development community by storm .
Git offers a much different type of version control in that it ’s a distributed version control system .
With a distributed version control system , there is n’t one centralized code base to pull the code from .
Different branches hold different parts of the code .
Other version control systems , such as SVN and CVS , use centralized version control , meaning that only one master copy of the software is used .
Git prides itself on being a fast and efficient system , and many major open - source projects use
Git to power their repositories ; projects like :
GitHub has recently helped establish Git as a great version control system , providing a beautiful front end for many large projects , such as Rails and Prototype .
However , Git is n’t as easy to pick up as CVS or SVN , so it ’s much harder to use for a beginner .
Git Resources
Mercurial
Mercurial is another open - source distributed version control system , like Git. Mercurial was designed for larger projects , most likely outside the scope of designers and independent Web developers .
That does n’t mean that small development teams ca n’t or should n’t use it .
Mercurial is extremely fast , and the creators built the software with performance as the most important feature .
The name “ mercurial ” is an adjective that means “ Relating to or having characteristics ( eloquence , swiftness , cleverness ) attributed to the god Mercury . ”
Aside from being very fast and scalable , Mercurial is a much simpler system than Git , which is why it appeals to some developers .
There are n’t as many functions to learn , and the functions are similar to those in other CVS systems .
It also comes equipped with a stand - alone Web interface and extensive documentation on understanding Mercurial if you have been using another system .
Bazaar
Bazaar is yet another distributed version control system , like Mercurial and Git , that offers a very friendly user experience .
It calls itself “ Version control for human beings . ”
It supports many different types of workflows , from solo to centralized to decentralized , with many variations in between .
One of the main features of Bazaar is the fine - grained control you ’ll have over the setup .
As shown with the workflows , you can use it to fit almost any scenario of users and setups .
This is a great revision control system for nearly any project because it ’s so easy to modify .
It ’s also embeddable , so you can add it to existing projects .
Bazaar also has a strong community that maintains things like plug-ins and lots of third - party tools , such as GUI software to add a graphical interface to the system .
Bazaar resources :

Showcases the differences between the two decentralized systems .
Monotone
Monotone is the baby of the distributed revision control bunch .
While many of Monotone ’s peers focus on performance , Monotone places higher value on integrity than performance .
In fact , it can take quite a bit of time for a new user of Monotone to simply download the initial repository due to the extensive validation and authentication required .
Monotone is fairly easy to learn if you ’re familiar with CVS systems , and it can import previous CVS projects .
However , it ’s not quite as popular as other version control systems .
QCT GUI commit tool A version control commit tool that supports Mercurial , Bazaar , Cogito ( Git ) , Subversion , Monotone , and CVS .
Meld is a merge and diff tool that allows you to compare two or three files and edit them in place , while updating automatically .
It works with CVS , Subversion , Bazaar and Mercurial .

The Beatles are coming to the world of video games .
Unfortunately , players wo n't have the chance to travel back in time to save John Lennon , but the creators of Rock Band are planning an " experiential journey " through the Fab Four 's career and music , to be released in late 2009 .
" This game will take you on a journey from the Beatles ' first album Please Please Me until the last album at Abbey Road , " Jeff Jones , CEO of the Beatles ' Apple Corps label , announced in a conference call yesterday .
" It will span samples of the whole catalogue all the way through . "
The project is a collaboration between Apple Corps , MTV Networks and Harmonix , the game developer whose hit Rock Band franchise has become a powerful vehicle for music promotion .
The surviving members of the Beatles , Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr , will be involved in the game 's creative planning , as will Beatles widows Yoko Ono and Olivia Harrison .
Though there had been rumours of a Beatles add - on to Rock Band proper , the game will be a stand - alone title .
It is not yet clear whether Rock Band 's current peripherals – that is , guitar , bass , microphone and drum controllers , - will be used in the Beatles game , or if new hardware will be developed .
Nor is it clear whether players will have the chance to play " as " John , Paul , George or Ringo .
Reps made vague comments about the game exploring the " imagery " of the Beatles alongside the music , which evokes visions of yellow submarines zapping at Blue Meanies .
McCartney 's statement was equally ambiguous .
" The project is a fun idea which broadens the appeal of the Beatles and their music , " he wrote .
" I like people having the opportunity to get to know the music from the inside out . "
The game 's music at least will be bona fide .
The soundtrack will be drawn from the master recordings of the Beatles ' UK releases , with any additional music production overseen by George Martin 's son , Giles , who co-produced the Beatles / Cirque du Soleil show , LOVE .
The game announcement is a major blow for Activision , who publish Rock Band 's main competitor , Guitar Hero .
Both companies had been courting the Beatles for years , hoping to add songs like While My Guitar Gently Weeps to their titles .
While Apple Corps cited MTV's involvement and Rock Band 's full - band game - play as major factors in their decision , finances will also have contributed .
Jones hinted at an unusual licensing deal being inked for the game , with each party owning a " piece " of the project .
" Nothing is typical about the Beatles , " he said .
Figures suggesting that fake anti-virus packages are allowing cybercrooks to make more than € 10 m a month are been described as little better than guesswork .
Vendors across the industry are warning that scarewore packages - which attempt to trick would - be marks into handing over their hard - earned cash for packages that claim to resolve fictitious infections - are a growing problem .
But estimates by Panda Security that 30 million Windows PCs have been infected with fake antivirus programs have met with skepticism from a rival vendor .
Graham Cluley , senior technology consultant at Sophos , question Panda 's assumption in reaching its figures , which he suggests are little better than back of the envelope calculations .
Panda has tracked almost 7,000 variants of the type of malware over the last year alone .
Prospective marks are often served up this type of malicious content after browsing pornographic sites , responding to fake electronic greeting cards or downloading warez .
In one case documented by Panda , a fake Google toolbar was used to promote the scam .
These various tricks are all designed to redirect users onto web pages selling fake antivirus products , designed to imitate the look and feel of legitimate packages ( as illustrated by screen shots by Panda here ) .
These programs follow a common pattern : users are warned that they are infected with malware via pop-up windows , desktops , and screensavers that keep appearing and getting in the way of using a computer normally .
The goal is to scare the less tech savvy into shelling out for products that are worse than useless .
None of these packages detect and defend against malware and some go as far as installing adware or , in extreme cases , banking Trojans on compromised PCs .
Dominic Hoskins , country manager Panda Security UK , explained : " The information we have at present suggests that some 3 per cent of these users have provided their personal details in the process of buying a product that claims to disinfect their computers .
In fact , they never even receive the product .
Extrapolating from an average European price of € 49.95 , we can calculate that the creators of these programs are receiving more than € 10 million per month " .
A blog posting explaining Panda 's calculation in greater depth can be found here .
Other security watchers criticise the assumptions Panda makes in arriving at its figures .
Graham Cluley , senior technology consultant at Sophos , told El Reg : " It looks like Panda says they looked at two million computers , and found three per cent were infected with fake anti-virus .
In other words , 60,000 computers . "
" They 've then taken Forrester 's estimate of how many computers there will be by the end of 2008 and extrapolated that there must - therefore - be 30 million computers infected by fake anti-virus .
That 's quite a jump , and I think a flawed one . "

Recent research has analysed the link between the harmful effects of drugs relative to their current classification by law with some startling conclusions .
Perhaps most startling of all is that alcohol , solvents and tobacco ( all unclassified drugs ) are rated more dangerous than ecstasy , 4 - MTA and LSD ( all class A drugs ) .
If the current ABC system is retained , alcohol would be rated a class A drug and tobacco class B.
The scientists involved , including members of the government 's top advisory committee on drug classification , have produced a rigorous assessment of the social and individual harm caused by 20 of the UK 's most dangerous drugs and believe this should form the basis of future ranking .
They think the current ABC system is arbitrary and not based on any scientific evidence .
The drug policies have remained unchanged over the last 40 years so should they be reformed in the light of new research ?
GOP leader : Rebuild party based on ' sanctity of marriage ' David Edwards and Andrew McLemore
Published : Sunday November 9 , 2008
Print This Email This The Republican brand is still alive and well , Rep. Mike Pence said on Fox News Sunday .
When asked by Chris Wallace what " conservative solutions " the GOP would bring to their current minority - party status , Pence said social issues like " the sanctity of marriage " will remain the backbone of the Republican platform .
" You build those conservative solutions , Chris , on the same time - honored principles of limited government , a belief in free markets , in the sanctity of life , the sanctity of marriage , " Pence said .
The Indiana representative cited the ballot measures against gay marriage that passed on Election Day as evidence of the continuing presence of conservative values .
" There were three state referendums on marriage ... all three carried .
The vitality of the conservative movement around the country is very real , " said Pence .
Pence is set for the No. 3 spot among Republicans in the House of Representatives , while Rep. Eric Cantor is generally viewed as the heir to the No. 2 position .
Cantor also spoke on Fox News Sunday and agreed with Wallace that the GOP must evolve to meet the challenges of posed by the Internet savvy Obama machine .
" There 's no question that the Republican Party has got to stop doing things the way we 've always done them , " Cantor said .
Cantor told Wallace that Republicans would be counterweight against the power of the Democrats .
Cantor said , " You will see a Republican party in Congress serving as a check and a balance against Mr. Obama 's power and Speaker Pelosi 's power . "
Although the Republican Party suffered a major loss to Democrats in Tuesday 's election , Pence agreed with Cantor and said Republicans still have power granted by normal people .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi abandoned her " historic opposition " against offshore drilling , Pence said , because the American people " mobilized " around the Republican Party .
" We 're going to invite the American people to join us in stopping any slide to the left by the Obama administration or Pelosi Democrats , " Pence said .

Senator John McCain may have disappointed many expectant voters and debate viewers with the decision to suspend his campaign , but none more so than a late - night talk show host on CBS .
David Letterman was so unhappy that Mr. McCain canceled his scheduled appearance on his show Wednesday night that he spent much of the first segment assailing the senator ’s decision and suggesting “ something does n’t smell right ” about the Senator ’s plan to go to Washington to work on the financial crisis .
Mr. Letterman told his audience that Senator McCain had called him directly on short notice Wednesday , to tell him he had to cancel his appearance .
After expressing his admiration for Mr. McCain and his sacrifice as a prisoner of war in Vietnam , Mr. Letterman said , “ When you call up at the last minute and cancel , that ’s not the John McCain I know . ”
He repeated that “ something smells right now ” and he suggested “ somebody must have put something in his Metamucil . ”
Mr. Letterman said Mr. McCain had said the economy was “ about to crater ” which necessitated that he get to Washington right away .
Mr. Letterman then suggested that McCain should not be suspending his campaign at all and that he could have “ sent in the second - string quarterback , ” his vice presidential running mate , Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska , to fill in for him .
“ You do n’t quit , ” Mr. Letterman said .
After suggesting that Ms. Palin should be prepared to step up and “ be ready , ” because “ the poor guy is getting a little older , ” Mr. Letterman reconsidered and said of Ms. Palin ’s readiness , “ Do n’t get me started . ”
Even after Mr. Letterman brought out Keith Olbermann , the MSNBC host and vituperative Republican critic as the substitute guest for Mr. McCain , he continued to assail Mr. McCain for the decision to cancel the appearance .
His critique reached a high point when he learned that at the very moment Mr. McCain was supposed to be on the couch next to him being interviewed , the senator was at the CBS News center three blocks away in Manhattan , getting ready to be interviewed by the CBS News anchor , Katie Couric .
Mr. Letterman ordered his director to put on a live feed from that location , which showed Mr. McCain getting made up to go on with Ms. Couric .
“ He does n’t seem to be racing to the airport , ” Mr. Letterman observed .
After listening to some questions from Ms. Couric , Mr. Letterman said , “ Hey , John , I ’ve got a question : You need a lift to the airport ? ”
He then asked Mr. Olbermann if he thought this was all Mr. McCain ’s fault , or whether other factors had come into play .
“ He ditched you , ” Mr. Olbermann said .
Missing Ballots , Uncounted Absentees and the GOP PR Battle That May Trump Both ...

UPDATE at end of article .
Math / statistics / poll-wiz Nate Silver at FiveThirtyEight.com predicts the race between incumbent MN Sen. Norm Coleman ( R ) and challenger Al Franken ( D ) could result in a 27 vote win for Franken .
That 's right , just 27 votes .
With that in mind , every single vote matters , so it's of note that the Franken campaign is now wondering about some missing ballots in a number of counties .
From Public Record 's coverage last night :
According to the secretary of state 's website , 1,074 people in Clay County voted on Election Day but only 1,069 ballots were produced by the county for the recount .
In St. Louis County , 1,649 people voted on Election Day but the county turned over 1,646 ballots for the recount .
And in Washington County , 1,464 voted on Election Day but 1,449 ballots were turned over for the recount .
The shortfall can easily shift the election to Franken or Coleman 's favor because the race between the candidates is so close .
That in mind , we 'll take the opportunity to remind both parties in the recount of our earlier suggestion that they make public records requests ( if they have n't already ) for the invoices from printers of all of the original ballots , and then request that all ballots --- including unvoted ballots --- be counted as part of the final reconciliation of ballots .
The number of voted , spoiled , and unvoted ballots should be exactly equal to the number of ballots shown as printed originally on those invoices .
If not , there 's a problem .
But while ballots have now turned up " missing , " and absentees have been tossed from the hand count , the GOP seems to be preparing for a FL 2000 PR gambit to " win " at all costs ...
We 've got a few more notes / thoughts on a couple of related ballot issues that have bubbled up over the last few days as we 've been driving across the country .
Given the closeness of this race , these issues could ultimately end up deciding it one way or another , even as the GOP seems to be preparing a FL 2000 PR gambit to " win " at all costs , no matter the final outcome of the hand - count ...
Rejected Absentee Ballots ...
Franken 's team has been fighting for the information of voters whose absentee ballots were rejected for one reason or another , charging that they should be included in the current " recount . "
Or , at least in the alternative , they should be allowed the information on those voters so they can double - check to make sure the ballots --- some rejected because the signatures were believed not to match the voters ' registration forms --- were legitimately rejected .
As San Diego election attorney Ken Karan noted via email , in regard to absentee ballots that were tossed out due to perceived signature mismatches in an ongoing challenged election in California , the onus ought to be on election officials to prove that these are , in fact , illegally cast ballots .
If so , then there need to be voter fraud investigations and / or prosecutions for all of them .
They are either legal ballots , or unlawful forgeries , and should result in prosecutions .
" It should not be as simple to discard a ballot because the signatures do n't match after a subjective comparison of signatures by people without any recognized expertise in the recognition of handwriting , " Karan wrote .
" Furthermore , if the signatures do n't match , then that should mean that someone is trying to vote someone else 's ballot .
Now , that is voter fraud .
Every questionable ballot should either be verified with the voter whose registration signature is at issue , or it should be the subject of a criminal prosecution . "
The practice of tossing out ballots based on signature mismatches , without recourse for the voter --- for example , notifying them , and allowing them to confirm that it was their ballot , and they are who they said they were --- needs to stop .
We 've got a bum right wrist these days ( blogging injury ) and believe our signature , right now , would not likely match our signature from 10 years ago , or so , when we originally registered to vote in California .
We'd be pretty ticked off if our vote was not allowed to count on that basis !
Yet , ballots are routinely discarded in this manner , and likely , thousands of legal voters disenfranchised in the bargain .
The GOP's FL 2000 Strategy Redux ...
We 've been noting the rapidly increasing number of challenged ballots by both campaigns .
Nate Silver , who noted that Coleman 's challenges suddenly increased exponentially as of Day 4 of hand - counting , believes that there are likely more legitimate challenges in the Franken stack than in the Coleman stack , and those ballots --- counted by the state Canvassing Board after the initial hand count is concluded --- will likely determine the race .
On the heels of our coverage of that issue yesterday , which noted that Coleman now seems to be making ridiculous challenges at this point --- e.g. , ballots showing votes for McCain and for Franken , or for nobody at all in the Senate race , must have been voter error --- several have suggested that Coleman 's challenges may be part of a scheme to keep his " lead " from the original machine tabulated count in place .
The strategy would allow Coleman the ( cynical ) PR advantage of being able to claim : " We won the original count !
And we won the recount ! "
Sound familiar , yet ?
That misleading claim will be made loudly across the entire Republican echo - chamber ( which , shamefully , includes your public airwaves on talk radio , 24/7 ) and will be followed quickly with : " Do n't let leftist , MoveOn.org - supported , Democrat Sec. of State Mark Ritchie thwart the will of the people and steal the election for Al Franken with his hand - picked State Canvassing Board ! "
While an absurd case to make , hey , it worked for George W. Bush in 2000 when the GOP claimed " He won the first count , he won the recount , he won the second recount , etc . "
Never mind that none of those counts were ever completed , or even carried out as per state law , the Bush team was more than happy to go all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court making that case , and that their client would be " irreparably harmed " if all ballots were allowed to be counted , since the media had already announced him as the " winner . "
On that score , we 'll take the opportunity to mention that had all of the ballots been allowed to have been counted in the state of Florida in 2000 , Al Gore would have been the winner [ PDF ] .
Receiving the most votes is beside the point for the GOP , however .
They have proven themselves willing to do anything to win .
If you have any question about that , go see their shameful , official " Minnesota Recount " website where they have been claiming for weeks that Franken and the Democrats are " stealing the election . "
The official website of the National Republican Senatorial Committee ( NRSC ) has been unabashedly making that case , for weeks , without any actual evidence to support their ridiculous claim .
But who cares .
Anything to " win " for those guys , apparently .
UPDATE FROM STEVE HELLER , 5:45 pm PT :

SHANGHAI  More contaminated Chinese candy was discovered in the United States on Wednesday , this time in Connecticut , where consumer protection officials issued a public warning against eating the sticky sweet .
In China , meanwhile , a couple filed a lawsuit against the company at the center of the tainted dairy scandal despite efforts by authorities to keep the issue out of the courts .
The discovery announced Wednesday involved the White Rabbit Creamy Candy brand , which is sold in 50 countries but has already been recalled from stores in Britain and many Asian countries .
Jerry Farrell Jr. , Connecticut ’s consumer protection commissioner , announced that contaminated candy had been found at two stores in New Haven , one in West Hartford and one in East Haven .
In each case , tests found traces of an industrial additive , melamine , in the candy .
“ We ’re concerned , obviously , there may have been bags sold of these before we got to them , ” Mr. Farrell said on Wednesday , according to The Associated Press .

Burning fossil fuels accounts for 80 percent of the rise of atmospheric CO2 in industrial times .
Now NASA researchers Pushker Kharecha and James Hansen show that CO2 can be kept below harmful levels as long as emissions from coal are phased out within the next few decades .
In other words , we can burn all the oil and gas that ’s left on Earth and still avoid really dangerous climate change .
Previous research shows the super dangerous level of global warming will occur if CO2 in the atmosphere exceeds a concentration of 450 parts per million .
It ’s currently at about 385 ppm , up from a pre-industrial 280 ppm .
The research revolved around five emissions scenarios spanning the years 1850 - 2100 .
Each reflects a different estimate for peak of fossil fuel production — an important yet unknown variable .
On one end was the “ business - as - usual ” scenario .
The other scenarios included reducing emissions from coal .
First by developed countries starting in 2013 .
Then by developing countries a decade later .
Finally leading to a global phase out by 2050 .
The last three scenarios consider different dates for peak oil .
The bottom line is clear .
. .
Even if we calculate unconstrained emissions from conventional oil and gas , there is simply not enough of these fuels left to take CO2 above 450 parts per million .
On the other hand , coal and unconventional fuels like methane hydrates and tar sands contain much more fossil carbon than conventional oil and gas and should be pahsed out or never started up in the first place .
“ Because coal is much more plentiful than oil and gas , reducing coal emissions is absolutely essential to avoid ‘ dangerous ’ climate change brought about by atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration exceeding 450 parts per million , ” Kharecha said .
“ The most important mitigation strategy we recommend — a phase - out of carbon dioxide emissions from coal within the next few decades — is feasible using current or near - term technologies . ”
Cut the coal , save the world .
Clean coal ?
Do n’t be an oxymoron .

Billed as “ your official , comprehensive connection to the heart of Barack Obama and Joe Biden ’s campaign , ” Obama ’s campaign today released an official election application for the iPhone and iPod touch .
This marks the first sanctioned application release from either side in the American presidential race , though several unofficial apps of varying utility have previously been available .
It ’s immediately clear upon launch that the application was not rushed , but was actually developed with care and attention to detail .
The UI is clean and attractive ( despite the Windows - ish color scheme ) and the action is snappy .
It was clearly developed with two key aims in mind : promote all things Obama and encourage you to do the same .
The app is innovative in that it goes beyond being simply an information delivery tool .
Instead it uses the unique capabilities of the iPhone platform to attempt to make campaigners out of anyone who downloads it .
The first option you ’re presented with is “ Call Friends , ” which searches your contact list and prioritizes your friends and associates based on whether or not their state is considered a key battleground .
You can then call them directly from the list to attempt to sway their vote .
Need ammunition ?
What if , for instance , your old Ohioan college roommate is n’t about Obama ’s stance on seniors and social security and would like you to explain it to him ?
With the “ Issues ” menu , you can toe the party line without even knowing it ahead of time .
All the media you can swallow regarding the Obama campaign is also only a few taps away , complete with a convenient absence of counterpoint material .
To be fair , the app never claims balance , nor should it , considering the source .
Now that the first shots have been fired in the war to win voters by way of their most beloved handheld electronic device , it ’ll be interesting to see if the McCain campaign fires back .
Of course , it ’s always possible that they ’ll spin it as yet another example of Obama ’s elitism and leave it at that .
What do you think ?
Brilliant campaign move or merely preaching to the converted ?

Manny Being Manipulated
and
hen I was working for " Jimmy Kimmel Live " in April 2003 , our gregarious executive producer , Daniel Kellison , convinced a few notable Red Sox players to be our guest announcers before a three - game series in Anaheim .
This was n't a ratings ploy , just a way for the show 's New England transplants to hang out with as many Boston players as possible .
When we learned Johnny DamonManny Ramirez were coming , we were infinitely more excited than for Britney Spears ' appearance six months later .
" And we 're going out afterward ! " Daniel predicted gleefully .
" We 're taking them out ! "
Ezra Shaw / Getty Images
These facts remain indisputable : Manny is a first - ballot Hall of Famer and one of the big reasons The Curse is no more .
To Daniel 's disbelief , I made myself a game - time decision .
See , I think like a fan , write like a fan and try like hell to keep it that way .
If I went drinking with my favorite players , I might see things that could n't be unseen .
That was verified right after the show finished , when everyone poured into our legendary green room and I caught one of my heroes eyeing three scantily clad bimbos like a starving cheetah stalking a herd of grazing deer .
2
That was it for me .
In retrospect , I should have gone out because my buddies passed along every upsetting nugget anyway .
Like the player who yanked his wedding ring off with an exaggerated pull while dancing with one of our attractive co-workers , the implication being , " Tonight , I 'm single , baby ! "
Every time I watched the Sox from then on , when Wedding Ring Guy came to bat , I thought of him hitting on our 22 - year - old talent assistant and jamming that ring in his pocket .
And you wonder why I never want to drink with my favorite players .
Daniel was n't nearly as bothered , even gushing the following day , " This was one of the great nights of my life . "
I made my exit stage right as he was herding a swollen group of players and co-workers to a nearby Hollywood club in two stretch limousines .
Sadly , I missed David Ortiz pulling out an AmEx card in Daniel 's limo , waving it with his signature gap - toothed smile and announcing happily , " I got Manny 's credit card tonight ! "
Everyone cheered like they 'd just won the pennant .
With Manny riding in the other limo , they started telling " Manny Being Manny " stories , like how Manny routinely stuffed uncashed paychecks in the top shelf of his locker .
Seems he rarely got around to cashing them .
The checks were for $ 978,000 every two weeks during the season .
( Big Papi knew the exact number because he made a team employee show him one . )
Manny lived in a one - bedroom condo outside of Boston until Ortiz joined the club and made him relocate to the presidential suite at the Four Seasons .
Daniel thought Manny 's teammates made him sound like Tom Hanks in " Big , " a little kid trapped in an adult 's body .
Everyone got a sincere kick out of him .
Or so it seemed .
3
They arrived at the club and Daniel started ordering drinks left and right .
After all , Manny was paying !
Three fun hours that I 'm a fool for passing up ensued .
The check arrived .
Papi pulled out Manny 's card , felt an unexpected twinge of guilt and confessed .
4
And Manny -- the alleged idiot savant with uncashed checks spilling out of his locker , the so - called dummy who stumbled into a record contract and should have been conned into paying for everything by his much , much , much smarter teammates -- was laughing and saying , " Nononono , I 'm not paying " before grabbing the card after a friendly tussle .
Manny might have been dumb enough to lose his AmEx card , but he was also smart enough to get it back .
The check sat there .
And it sat there .
You know who ended up paying ?
Daniel .
Quite possibly the poorest guy there .
Five years later , he remembers the exact figure : " 860 dollars . "
Only in Hollywood .
Jim Rogash / Getty Images Red Sox fans never could figure out Manny ... but they could n't stop watching him , either .
The invisible villain
I thought of that story when Manny began acting up again this summer .
Boston 's brain trust had decided to dump him .
Again .
We were doing this dance for the fourth time in six years .
There were two crucial differences this time , the first being Manny had canned his old agents and hired Scott Boras , one of the worst human beings in America who has n't actually committed a crime .
5
Manny 's contract was set to expire after the 2008 season , with Boston holding $ 20 million options for 2009 and 2010 .
Boras could n't earn a commission on the option years because those fees belonged to Manny 's previous agents .
He could only get paid when he negotiated Manny 's next contract .
And Scott Boras always gets paid .
The second difference ?
The guys running the Red Sox felt like flexing their muscles this time around .
They had renovated Fenway Park , turned the team into a cash cow , captured two titles and become local celebrities on par with Denis Leary and the creepy guys from Aerosmith .
They did n't feel like dealing with Manny anymore .
Although it 's usually impossible to jettison a popular star without a backlash from fans , the Red Sox wield unprecedented sway over nearly every relevant media outlet that covers them .
One of the team 's minority partners , the New York Times Company , happens to own Boston 's signature newspaper ( The Globe ) .
The team owns a cable channel ( NESN ) that shows every Sox game , pregame show and postgame show .
The Sox signed cushy deals with Boston 's signature sports radio station ( WEEI ) and sister station ( WRKO ) , and since those rights always can be shopped to a competitor down the road , you 'll see CC Sabathia hit an inside - the - park home run before a Red Sox owner gets ripped to shreds on WEEI .
They even have good relationships with every relevant national writer , including Peter Gammons , the face of baseball for ESPN , a beloved figure in New England and a longtime friend of general manager Theo Epstein .

For a guy who does n't " Respect The Game , " Manny still has put up some of the best numbers of his generation .
Why is this important ?
As Manny Ramirez 's memorable Red Sox career began to crumble for good , two people were to blame ( Manny and Boras ) , and yet we only heard about one of them .
Had the identity of the second villain been revealed , maybe Boston fans would n't have been so eager to downgrade from a first - ballot Hall of Famer to Jason Bay .
But we 're getting ahead of ourselves .
We know for sure that , heading into the last year of a $ 160 million deal that seemed lavish at the time and turned out to be money well spent , Boston 's hierarchy ( Epstein and owners John Henry , Tom Werner and Larry Lucchino ) basically told Manny and Boras , " We are n't giving you an extension after the best offensive stretch in Red Sox history that did n't involve Ted Williams , and we 're also not deciding on our 2009 and 2010 options yet .
Let 's see how you do this season . "
In other words , welcome to no -man 's land !
By not making a decision , the Red Sox did make a decision :
They turned the situation over to Boras and expected his most impressionable client to handle himself with professionalism and class .
Like that would happen .
6
Once Manny shifted into sulk mode , the Red Sox wasted no time painting him as a malcontent .
After Manny berated the team 's 64 - year - old traveling secretary and shoved the poor guy to the ground , the team did everything but hire actors to re-enact the incident on www.redsox.com.7
After Manny skipped a crucial game against the Yankees , claiming he had a sore knee , management made a point of getting MRIs on both knees and telling reporters he was fine .
Did the team ever suspend him ?
Of course not .
That would have made too much sense .
Once the old school baseball writers started hissing that Manny did n't respect The Game , for many Boston fans , that was the final straw .
And maybe they were right -- after all , it 's indefensible to quit on your team just because you do n't like your bosses , especially in November when you 're about to make crucial trades and free - agent signings .
( Whoops , I 'm getting my " Guys Who Quit on the Red Sox " confused !
I 'm thinking of Epstein , who ditched them after the 2005 season because he was tired of dealing with Lucchino .
Sorry about that . )
8
As the trading deadline approached and Manny continued his " Beavis and Butt - Head " routine , the team steadfastly refused to suspend him or publicly call out his home - wrecking agent .
Why ?
I could n't possibly tell you .
Maybe the Sox wanted Manny to keep hanging himself .
In a July game against the Angels , Manny hit a double - play ball and jogged to first base with the intensity of an underpaid bus boy cleaning a table at Denny's .
I watched it happen live on TV and did n't blink .
On the NESN broadcast , Jerry Remy was coughing up a lung in disgust .
Look , I 've seen Manny pull this crap at least 200 times in eight years .
This was worse than the other 199 times ?
Come on .
Over the course of the next 72 hours , " Baseball Tonight " probably spent 68 of those hours replaying that highlight while Buster Olney 's face turned various shades of maroon .
Bill Simmons discusses Manny Ramirez 's departure from Boston on " Outside the Lines . "
The critics quickly began singing a familiar chorus : Manny does n't respect The Game !
He just does n't respect The Game !
The guy just DOES NOT respect The Game !
Manny ... Ramirez ... does not ... respect ... The Game !
Quick tangent : I do n't know what the hell this means .
If you want to win the old - school media guys , really , you only have to do six things : run out every ground ball , end up with a dirty uniform every once in a while , show up on time , give reporters whatever time they need , light up like a little kid if Willie Mays or Hank Aaron ever walks into the dugout , and smile broadly during games ( so the announcers can talk about how you 'd play this game for free , even though you just opted out of your contract and held your team hostage for a $ 100 million raise ) .
Do those things and you earn an " I Respect The Game " card .
We should also mention that ...
A. Boston won two titles with a Hall of Famer who did n't respect The Game ( Manny ) and zero titles with a Hall of Famer who did ( Carl Yastrzemski ) .
B. Players considered " Respects The Game " guys in their primes include Pete Rose ( convicted felon , baseball gambler ) , Roger Clemens ( identified as a cheater in the Mitchell Report ) and ( fill in the names of at least 12 - 15 other major stars from the Steroids Era ) .
You can't define " RESPECTS THE GAME ! " in this day and age .
You really can't .
Manny played 135 - 145 games every season , remained exceedingly durable into his mid-30s and did n't cheat like numerous other sluggers did.9
In his prime , you could bank on an on - base percentage between .405 and .440 , as well as 35 - 45 homers , 105 - 140 RBIs and countless clutch hits .
In his current condition ( post - prime , still effective ) , you can count on a .400 - plus OBP , 25 - 30 homers , 90 - 100 RBIs and at least two torrid streaks when he carries your offense for two solid weeks ... and that is your worst - case scenario .
For someone who did n't respect The Game , he sure was one of the most dependable hitters in The Game .10 Even his funks were reliable .
They always happened during the dog days of July and August , when the oppressive New England heat suddenly turned him into a dreadlocked Corey Haim .
A defining play or anecdote would get things rolling : Maybe he'd duck a game against a top pitcher , miss a team meeting , dog a flyball or whatever .
The media would descend like wolverines because that 's what they do in Boston .
A few rumored deals would collapse , everything would settle down , and we would start cheering for Manny again .
11
Not this time .
With the Red Sox underachieving for the first month of summer , even my father grew tired of Manny 's crap and wanted him gone ... and Dad was one of Manny 's last defenders , the man who once declared , " I do n't care if Manny sits in the dugout naked as long as he 's putting up those stats every year . "

If Manny had run the bases with this much vigor for the Red Sox , he might still be in Boston .
Like a loyal sap , I kept hoping Manny would snap out of his latest huff .
Since Boston signed him in 2000 , my life changed in the following ways : I started writing for ESPN , moved to California , worked on a TV show , wrote a book , got married , fathered two kids , bought a house , purchased two " Red Sox World Championship " videos and knocked up Jamie - Lynn Spears .
Over the last three years , my daughter has seen Manny and Papi on our television more than the Wiggles and Elmo combined .
Manny became part of my family , for God 's sake .
Does n't that count for anything ?
Was n't it hypocritical for any Boston fan to turn on Manny after we willingly signed up for the Manny Experience in December 2000 ... for better or worse , like marriage ?
We knew we were getting a happy - go - lucky , mercurial slugger with Hall of Fame numbers whom everyone described as " odd but lovable . "
During ESPN 's captivating " Outside the Lines " special about the signing one month later , we learned Manny nearly changed his mind at the last minute when he realized he could n't bring Frankie Mancini along with him .
Who 's Frankie Mancini ?
The Cleveland clubhouse attendant who set up the pitching machine for him every afternoon .
Think about that for a second .
It 's patently insane .
12
When that show aired , did anyone say , " Uh- oh , this dude is crazy , get your guards up now , he 's gonna break our hearts ? "
NO !!!!!!!!!!
Nobody said it !
Nobody !
We were happy to have a potential folk hero on our hands .
When Manny surpassed every comedic expectation and crushed the ball for the first six weeks of 2001 , we serenaded him with " Mah - knee ! Mah - knee ! " chants and acted like we won the fan lottery .
Manny's No. 24 home jersey started popping up in New England more frequently than " Re-elect Kennedy " signs .
If you were watching at home and flipping channels , you always returned in time for Manny 's next at - bat .
If you were hungry or thirsty at the game , the best time for a concession run was any inning with a Manny at - bat .
Why ?
Because nobody else in Fenway was getting up .
That 's how it went for the first seven years , for better and worse .
By the 2007 playoffs , Manny had evolved into the jelly to Big Papi 's peanut butter .
Our quirky cleanup hitter craved big moments and enjoyed celebrating them as much as anyone .
During a rain delay against the Yankees last weekend , NESN showed the 2007 team video and one moment startled me : After Dustin Pedroia cranked his insurance home run against Cleveland in Game 7 of the ALCS , he skipped happily back to the dugout and was greeted by a delirious bear hug from ... yup , Manny Ramirez .
Look , I understand how a jerk like Bonds would have been a dreadful teammate : massive ego , bombastic personality , substantial sense of entitlement , painful sense of humor , hogged three lockers , always had 40 media members crowding around him .
But what was Manny doing exactly ?
13 How was Manny 's latest " funk " much different than Carlos Delgado seemingly mailing it in until Willie Randolph was fired , then miraculously regaining the ability to smile and hit home runs for Jerry Manuel ?
For anyone who believes the Manny trade saved the 2008 season -- with the theory being the Sox came together after his departure -- how do we know that would n't have happened anyway ?
Their schedule was significantly easier in August and September .
14 Young relievers Justin Masterson and Manny Delcarmen settled into a groove down the stretch , something that would have happened with or without Manny .
15
And do you really think a Boras client would sabotage his final two months before free agency ?
As for the " We could n't rely on Manny anymore " argument , why could you wager your mortgage on him in September and October ?
During the winning postseasons in '04 and ' 07 , Manny had 135 plate appearances , reached base 62 times , drove in 27 RBIs , stroked 12 extra - base hits , made it impossible to pitch around Ortiz and worked God - knows - how - many pitch counts .
Was that reliable enough for you ?
If anything changed other than Boras getting a " Special Guest Star " tag in Manny 's ongoing sitcom , it was an ever - evolving 25 - man roster : more happy - to - be - there youngsters and businesslike veterans , considerably fewer Latinos and free spirits -- guys who seemed woefully ill - equipped to handle Hurricane Manny .
For most of this decade , Boston 's veterans and managers looked after Manny the same way you 'd look after a dog : Keep remembering to feed him , walk him , rub his belly and occasionally smack his snout and he 'll be fine ... and if you forget to keep doing those things , it 's your fault when he craps on the rug .
Manny 's 2008 meltdown was n't much different than the ones in 2003 , 2005 and 2006 , only nobody kept him in check this time around .
It was just a different team .
When Coco Crisp charged the mound in June and got summarily pounded and sucker - punched by a swarm of angry Rays , not a single Boston player had his back or seemed especially perturbed about what happened .
I thought it was the most telling moment of the season .
If they were n't sticking up for Coco , they certainly were n't standing up to Manny Ramirez .16
Steven Senne - Pool / Getty Images Red Sox brass Tom Werner , left , Larry Lucchino and Theo Epstein , right , were willing to put up with Manny during two World Series runs .
In 2008 , however , they decided they 'd had enough .
Love is blind
The relationship between a fan and his baseball team is unlike anything else .
If you love a team -- if you truly love it -- then that team infiltrates your daily life for six straight months ( seven if you 're lucky ) .
You wake up , you shower , you eat , you work , you eat , you watch your baseball team , you sleep .
When the Mets collapsed for the third straight season last week , my devastated friends who follow them all said the same thing : it was n't losing again as much as reflecting on those 162 games and the hundreds of hours wasted along the way .
They felt betrayed .
Only baseball does that to you .
It 's a game of routine , of watching one at - bat after another , hoping something different happens , of relishing the little things that happen along the way .
You do n't know your favorite players personally , but you feel like you do .
And I felt like I knew Manny after seven years .
At least a little .
Which is why I still can't fathom that such an endearing oddball could morph into a cancer .

Manny definitely knows his way around a champagne celebration -- but is n't that scoreboard message jumping the gun a little bit ?
The man made me giggle and guffaw more than every other Boston athlete combined .
His funniest moments always happened in left field , where every crucial line drive left us murmuring , " ohgodohgodohgodohgod , " only he would usually make the play as we sighed in relief .
Manny kept us on our toes .
He took a leak inside the Green Monster during a pitching change .
He randomly cut off throws from other outfielders without explanation .
He took crazy angles on fly balls and regarded the warning track like a shark - infested moat .
At least 50 times over the last eight years , he clumsily chased down short fly balls with his patented " I 'm trying like hell to blow out my ACL " slide .
An inordinate amount of innings ended with Manny turning a fairly routine catch into a highlight reel , somehow making the play in the end , then laughing happily and tossing the baseball into Section 33 .
Of all the Boston left fielders in my lifetime , only Yaz played line drives off the Monster better -- yet another wrinkle for the " I will never , ever figure this guy out " angle -- and Manny possesses a sneaky - good throwing arm that many runners underestimated over the years .
17 He did everything with a smile on his face .
There was nothing contrived about the guy .
Even when he belted one of his signature bombs and ogled it for a few impressed steps -- and by the way , this was often -- opposing pitchers rarely seemed to take it personally .
Just Manny Being Manny , right ?
He always seemed happiest after somebody else 's walk - off home run , during the ensuing mosh pit at home plate , when everyone crammed into a semi-circle to congratulate the hero with a sea of headslaps and jumps .
You could always count on Manny to act like the craziest guy at a Fugazi concert .
Nobody loved the walk - off mosh pit more .
I spent more time wondering about his relationship with teammates than you can imagine .
No Red Sox player generated a more eclectic collection of dugout reactions .
18 Perplexed glances .
Hearty laughs .
Intense whispers .
Even times when his teammates silently peered at Manny like they were watching a drunk guy teetering along on a sidewalk .
You know , like they did n't want to miss anything in case something unexpected happened .
Always , always , always -- always ! -- he remained interesting .
As strange as this sounds , he might have been the most interesting person in my life .
I spent more time trying to figure him out than anyone else ; even my wife .
I solved him in certain ways , like how you could pinpoint the precise moment when he was breaking out of a slump : always in a close game , always during an at - bat when the Sox needed him to drive in a big run .
Manny would start fouling off pitches and regaining his timing .
The at - bat would extend to eight pitches , maybe nine , maybe 10 .
Finally , the pitcher would try to sneak a third strike by him on the outside corner -- the spot teams always attacked Manny when he was slumping , because a slump meant he was trying to pull everything too much -- but this time , Manny would relax and smack a line drive to right - center .
And I would call my father immediately and say , " Did you see it ?
Did you see it ?
He 's breaking out ! "
And for the next few weeks , you knew Manny would pound the living crap out of the baseball again .
It was that easy .
When Ortiz and Manny were clicking at the same time , like for the first few playoff games last October , the Red Sox simply could n't be defeated .
We had the modern - day Ruth and Gehrig and everyone else knew it .19 Call me crazy , call me nuts , call me a fool ... but I was n't enthusiastic about giving that up without a reason that surpassed , " Uh-oh , Manny is acting up again . "
I also believe -- fervently -- that Boston fans needed Manny in our lives .
Remember the way Sox fans behaved before October 2004 ?
Tight as a drum , always expecting the worst ?
Manny never noticed the nail - chewing , knuckle - cracking and hair - pulling .
The negative radio shows and columns never bugged him .
He just kept showing up with that same dopey smile and cranking line drives .
You could say he loosened up the entire city -- never receiving enough credit for this , by the way -- and when other self - proclaimed " Idiots " like Millar and Damon became his partners in crime , we ended up winning the 2004 World Series .
Coincidence ?
I say no .
If I had to pick a movie character to describe Manny 's effect on the team and its fans , it would be Dunphy from " Outside Providence , " the juvenile delinquent who showed up at the uptight ' 70s prep school , lightened things up , and within a few weeks , everyone knew how to roll a joint .
Jim Rogash / Getty Images Yes , the Red Sox broke up the modern equivalent of Ruth and Gehrig .
No , the Sports Guy does n't want to talk about it .
A lesson in revisionist history
" Outside Providence " ended with Dunph landing the hottest blonde in school , graduating and even heading to junior college .
20 Manny 's movie did n't end so happily .
After he " quit " on the team , the Sox moved heaven and earth to dump him .
The final straw happened when he left Fenway in a gorilla 's costume to hide from reporters .
( Oh , wait , that was Theo Epstein .
Sorry , I got my " Guys Who Quit on the Red Sox " group confused again . )
The Red Sox shipped him to Los Angeles one minute before the trade deadline , paying the rest of Manny 's 2008 salary , landing Bay from Pittsburgh as his " Respects - The - Game " replacement and sacrificing two piddling prospects in the deal .
21
This was n't a trade as much as a foreclosure .
They had foreclosed on Manny Ramirez .
As part of the transaction -- and this is crucial -- the Dodgers agreed to waive Manny 's 2009 option and grant him free agency .
Once the deal was confirmed , the pilot turned off the " No Skewering Manny " sign and allowed the media to move around the cabin carrying hatchets and poison - tipped darts .
22
We kept hearing how Manny quit on the Red Sox even if his July numbers did n't reflect it : 75 at - bats , 26 hits , four homers , 16 RBI , a .473 on - base percentage and a 1.060 OPS .
Only NESN's Remy handled the situation diplomatically , defending Manny 's tenure in Boston while expressing the appropriate amount of outrage at his recent behavior .
Remy said he believed the Manny soap opera had affected the clubhouse and needed to be resolved .
You know , because these guys were tired of being distracted from more important things , like playing poker , texting their friends or having 15 - minute conversations centered around topics like " Does my bat feel heavy ? " or " If it burns when I pee , that 's bad , right ? " 23 But like me , Remy had developed genuine affection for Manny and seemed perplexed by those final few weeks .
He kept coming back to the one question that nobody else seemed to be asking .
" Why ? "
Jim Rogash / Getty Images
By the time the trade deadline arrived , Red Sox Nation had turned against its enigmatic slugger .
Why did Manny start acting out ?
What triggered it ?
Manny made a vague reference to " they do n't like me and I do n't like them " at one point , but why did n't he like " them ? "
Manny showed up for spring training happier than ever , professed a sincere desire to finish his career in Boston .
24 By June , Manny was shoving senior citizens , swinging at teammates , feuding publicly with Henry and acting irrationally even for him .
So what happened ?
Did management offend him by not picking up the 2009 and 2010 options on his contract ?
Did he spiral out of control as soon as Ortiz and Julio Lugo disappeared with injuries , best friend Julian Tavarez was traded , and his Dominican Buddy Support Group vanished ?
Was Manny so obsessed with money that he went into napalm mode , hoping Boston would drop that 2009 option ( leaving him free to conceivably earn himself a more lucrative four - year deal ) , even though he already earned close to $ 200 million and stuffed uncashed paychecks in his locker like fan letters ?
Or was there a more sinister reason ?
( Cue the Darth Vader music . )
( Dah dah dah da - da - da da - da - da ... DAH DAH DAH da - da - da da - da - da ...)
Oh wait , we forgot ... his agent was Scott Boras !
How this double - talking burglar was omitted from the first paragraph of every post - Manny trade story remains one of the greatest inexplicabilities ( I just made up that word ) in sports media history .
25 THE GREEDIEST AND MOST RUTHLESS SPORTS AGENT OF ALL TIME WAS ONLY GETTING PAID IF HE COULD GET MANNY OUT OF THAT CONTRACT !
And we were asking " why ? " ???
Let 's pretend you were Boras last spring .
First , grow fangs and imagine you sleep in a coffin .
Second , divorce yourself from all parameters of human decency .
( Concentrate on those dollars signs .
Keep concentrating .
Block everything else out . )
Third , convince yourself the relationship between a player and his fans , no matter how long it has been cultivated , does n't matter even remotely .
Fourth , keep reminding yourself , as long as you can weasel Manny out of that '09 option with Boston , you 're looking at a four - year contract elsewhere for $ 80 - 100 million ... as well as a big fat commission for yourself .
You feeling it ?
You feeling like Boras yet ?
( Touch your new fangs to be sure . )
Well , here 's how you handle the " best interests " of your client :
By molding Manny like a piece of cancerous Play - Doh .
Maybe you start feeding him lines like , " Hey , I ca n't make progress on that 2009 option , they 're really worried that you 're washed up " and " I do n't know what 's wrong with Theo , supposedly he was ripping you to Gammons last week . "
You know every secondhand comment has a bigger purpose .
You know those little digs will add up .
You know Manny will start acting out .
The rest is history .
AP Photo / Gus Ruelas A routine fly ball to left ?
There was no such thing when Manny was patrolling the outfield for Boston .
If it did play out that way -- and I would bet anything it did -- would that explain Manny 's uncharacteristic anger in June and July ?
I say yes .
I say absolutely .
Again , it 's Scott Boras !
The guy could convince a hemophiliac to give blood .
Manny 's heel turn ( to borrow a wrestling term ) never could have happened without an evil " manager " prodding him and poking him .
26
For the life of me , I can't imagine how anyone could write a column , speak on television or give a radio interview within 72 hours of that trade without blaming Boras , as if the greediest sports agent of our lifetimes happened to be standing there idly while Manny 's career in Boston imploded .
You can't blame Manny just like you can't blame Lindsay Lohan for having awful parents or any Duke basketball player for turning into a whimpering crybaby .
That did n't stop Boston 's hierarchy from ignoring Boras ' behavior on the grassy knoll and directing everyone 's malice toward Lee Harvey Ramirez in the book depository .
As crazy as this sounds , agents seem to be gaining power these days .
Earlier this summer , David Falk squashed a potential Elton Brand - Baron Davis partnership and fumed that Brand and the Clippers left him out of the loop .
Although Brand had already given his word to Clippers coach Mike Dunleavy , Falk furiously shopped him and secured a bigger offer from Philadelphia , then commenced the process of poisoning Brand against his old team .
Lord knows what was said , what was twisted around , what lies were perpetuated .
Within a few days , Elton Brand -- the one guy who ever loved being a Clipper , the one - man marketing department who convinced buddy Baron Davis to play with him -- suddenly despised the Clippers and wanted to play somewhere else .
He eventually signed with Philly for $ 82 million , just a shade over what the Clippers were offering , as Falk established himself as a significant power broker again .
27
So much for Brand retiring as a Clipper .
So much for the relationships Brand had built with teammates , coaches and fellow team employees .
After the news broke , a friend who works for the Clippers sent me one of the saddest sports - related e-mails I 've ever read , describing the devastation in the office that day , how betrayed everyone felt , how younger employees were walking around in a daze .

You 'd think Scott Boras would be smiling .
After all , the man always gets paid .
" You feel like you know a guy , " my friend wrote , " and then you do n't . "
That 's sports in the 21st century for you .
Like Deep Throat tells Woodward in " All the President 's Men , " " just follow the money . "
It 's always about the money .
Always .
We have a slew of highly educated , highly intelligent , consistently devious agents controlling the interests of a broad number of athletes , many of whom are n't nearly as sophisticated as the people representing them .
Those athletes are allowed to act like divisive jerks or mope through games with no real repercussions , as long as it's happening for a larger goal -- either a new team or a new contract -- and player unions possess such disproportionate power that the NBA still can't randomly test for marijuana use .
28 During Manny 's final meltdown in Boston , when he allegedly turned into the clubhouse equivalent of pancreatic cancer , here 's how many times the team suspended him : zero .
That 's right ... zero .
Do n't you find this interesting ?
The Red Sox were willing to pay $ 7 million of Manny 's 2008 salary to dump him , but they were n't willing to suspend him as a last gasp to rescue their relationship with one of the best right - handed hitters of all time ?
From a distance , it sure seemed as if the owners never cared about disciplining Manny or salvaging his Boston tenure , only about how their fans and everyone covering the team perceived what was happening .
And they sure seemed petrified of crossing Boras , a power broker who will be wreaking havoc long after Manny Ramirez retires .
29 Manny took every hit , Boras took few ( if any ) until Gammons pointed a finger at him in an Aug. 29 column on ESPN.com , writing , " Management people point out that Boras proudly orchestrated the Manny Ramirez shutdown in Boston and , as Boras has told GMs , got Ramirez where he wanted him in Los Angeles .
Getting a player to opt out in the middle of his contract and essentially refuse to honor what he 'd signed is n't easy . "
What ????
Five weeks earlier , Gammons wrote that " Boras right now is trying to help Manny understand that it is in his best interest to , in Boras ' words , ' fulfill his current obligation , ' and put up the free - agent numbers here in Boston . "
Now Boras had orchestrated Manny 's departure ?
Would Boston fans have blessed this trade knowing that Manny -- painted as a greedy malcontent and a quitter in every medium -- was being manipulated by the real - life Bob Sugar ?
By mid-August , Sports Illustrated was reporting Boston 's decision - makers actually were split on making the Dodgers trade ( Henry and Epstein wanted to do it , Lucchino and Werner wanted to keep him ) , and Gammons said in a Boston.com chat that Manny 's former teammates were n't angry at him " because so many of them like Manny off the field , but what happened was that he became a distraction and players do n't like answering questions about other players when those players wo n't answer the questions themselves . "
So , Manny was n't a cancer after all ?
And everyone did n't agree that he had to go ?
You have to admit , it 's a little befuddling .

Stephen Dunn / Getty Images Los Angeles is the perfect place for Manny , who never seems too concerned about his day job .
Still haunted by Manny
If I never imagined the Red Sox would trade Manny Ramirez , I certainly never imagined him landing 20 minutes from my house .
L.A. is the perfect city for him : laid - back , bilingual , unfazed by mood swings and diva - like behavior , perfectly willing to embrace a true talent and overlook any other foibles .
Manny might seem like a freak in Boston , but in Los Angeles , a place where people spend their days figuring out the likes of the Lohans , the Olsen Twins , Mel Gibson and Britney , he makes more sense than a yoga mat sticking out of a Prius .
Unlike in New England , the daily mood in L.A. is n't determined by the fate of the local teams .
For a free spirit like Manny , you could n't ask for a better place to play baseball .
Just last weekend , he said to the Los Angeles Times , " Baseball in Boston is like a Sunday football game , but played every day .
We lose in L.A. , I go to breakfast and people say , ' Well , you 'll get them tomorrow . '
In Boston , it 's ' Hey , what 's going on , the Yankees are coming . '
It 's just a different atmosphere .
The fans in Boston got your back no matter what , but I 'm talking about the people who write all this bull because it means so much to them .
If your happiness depends on Boston winning or losing , you have to get a life . "
31
On the day the deal happened , I e-mailed my friend Tony , a die - hard Dodgers fan , and guaranteed him Manny would crush baseballs for six solid weeks .
There was no doubt .32 I saw everything coming before it happened : the " Mah - knee ! Mah - knee ! " chants , the palpable buzz at Chavez Ravine , the steady stream of line drives and the bombs , amused smiles from teammates , the giddy hop in his step , the " Thanks again for trading Manny ! " e-mails from my Yankee friends , the playful joshing with teammates , everything .33
Now the Dodgers are gunning for their first World Series in 20 years , led by the supposedly washed - up slugger who 's only hitting .396 with 17 homers , 53 RBI , a .489 OBP and .743 slugging percentage in Dodger blue .
Suddenly , I hear fellow customers discussing baseball as I 'm writing at various coffee joints in Hollywood .
I notice more Dodgers shirts and caps than ever before .
Manny 's picture seems to lead the L.A.
Times sports section every other day .
I even bought $ 60 worth of gas last week and paid a cashier wearing a No. 99 Ramirez jersey .
He 's back in my life , only not the way I hoped .34
I thought for sure I would have turned on him by now .
Has n't happened .
I keep making excuses for Manny and blaming everyone else .
Readers wonder how I could possibly defend Manny after spending the last few years ripping Vince Carter under suspiciously similar circumstances .
Friends wonder how I can possibly deny the 2008 Red Sox are better off without him .
Even my father can't understand why I 'm not rooting against Manny and the Dodgers this week as they battle the long - suffering Cubs .
" You do n't think it 's damning , " my Dad wondered recently , " that Manny has n't missed a game with the Dodgers ?
Whatever happened to his sore knee ? "
It 's a great question .
My defense :
We just spent the past decade hearing " Manny Being Manny " stories and allowing the man to be portrayed as a savant of sorts , the most simple of athletes , a happy - go - lucky hitter who rolled with the punches , never took himself seriously and was n't the sharpest tool in the shed .35 I watched him play for seven and a half years , day in and day out , and never saw anything to make me question that stereotype .
Now , I 'm expected to believe he was calculating and vindictive this whole time ?
Put it this way : I 'm not exactly ready to drop my coffee cup in slow motion like Chazz Palmentieri in " The Usual Suspects . "
Stephen Dunn / Getty Images Manny 's mere presence has reinvigorated the Dodgers and brought the buzz back to Chavez Ravine .
Meanwhile , Manny 's former team putters toward a shaky playoff destiny because of Josh Beckett 's strained oblique , unproven setup guys and a lineup that 's more banged - up than Shannen Doherty .
It 's hard to complain because , again , TWO WORLD SERIES IN FOUR YEARS !!!
We 're like a prep school team now ; we might as well be Brunswick School or Greenwich Country Day.36
We have a jarring number of white players with preppy names like " Jed " and " Justin . "
Our precocious and lovable MVP candidate ( Pedroia ) looks like a ninth grader who snuck onto the team only because he was related to the manager .
Everyone says and does the right things , including Bay , the new guy , a solid all - around player who did n't kill the season by any means .
37
If the 2004 team was personified by Manny and Damon , then the 2008 team is personified by Pedroia and Youkilis , who run out every groundball like they 're sprinting out of a burning building .
The 2008 Red Sox " Respect The Game . "
There 's no question .
It 's an exceedingly likable team .
And yet ...
I still miss Manny .
I can't lie .
It took me four solid weeks to accept that he was really gone .
Three weeks after the trade happened , I flicked on NESN for the opening pitch of a Sox game , noticed the SkyDome and thought , " Yes , Manny loves hitting in the SkyDome ! " A second passed .
A lightbulb went on .
My shoulders slumped .
Manny was gone .
I debated going to see him play at Dodger Stadium , finally concluding it would be too painful for me .
I thought about trekking down there to interview him , ultimately deciding on keeping a friendly and respectful distance .
I checked his box scores every day and prayed he'd keep hitting , only because every big game increased the chances of Manny re-signing with the Dodgers instead of the Yankees , who have the deepest pockets , irrational owners and an overwhelming need to make a splash next year .
38 A Manny - Yankees partnership would dwarf the effects of Damon 's departure from Boston three years ago .
Damon was a lark , a likable player who ultimately did n't matter .
Manny matters .
That 's why New York will overpay him , and that 's where Boras will send him unless the Dodgers step up .
It 's always about the money .
Always .

Try telling these guys that Manny is a bad teammate .
Will Manny understand the real reasons when it happens ?
How much does Manny understand in general ?
He 's dumb enough to leave uncashed paychecks sitting around and smart enough to earn those checks in the first place .
Dumb enough to get seduced by Boras , smart enough to heed his advice .
Dumb enough to burn bridges in Boston , smart enough to get what he wanted in the end .
Dumb enough to betray his old team , smart enough to embrace his new one .
He 's unredeeming in every way until you add up every little moment that made you like him in the first place .
Then he 's not so bad .
( I swear , this makes sense if you 're me . )
And so I refuse to blame him for what happened .

The one thing I learned from 2001 to 2008 was that Manny judged life by simple things : hits , home runs , salaries , fancy cars , even the efficient way someone set up a pitching machine .
When he 's unhappy , he can't hide it .
When he 's happy , he can't hide it .
He could never fathom spending $ 20 million a year , but he knows it 's the number he should make .
He did n't take it personally that the Red Sox never picked up his 2009 option , just that they did n't care whether he stayed or left .
He moved from a one - bedroom condo to a presidential suite at the fanciest hotel in town , liked living in both places ... and if that does n't tell you everything you need to know , then I give up .
So , how will this play out ?
I see Manny leading the Dodgers to the 2008 World Series , breaking their hearts and donning pinstripes next season .
He wo n't feel bad , because he 's Manny .
The L.A. fans will feel bad .
I will feel worse .
It will be the single most painful sports transaction of my lifetime .
It will make me question why I follow sports at all , why we spend so much time caring about people who do n't care about us .
I do n't want to hear Manny booed at Fenway .
I do n't want to root against him .
I do n't want to hold a grudge .
I do n't want to hear the " Mah - knee ! Mah - knee ! " chant echoing through the new Stadium .
I am not ready for any of it .
You love sports most when you 're 16 , then you love it a little bit less every year .
And it happens because of things like this .
Like Manny breaking the hearts of everyone in Boston because his agent wanted to get paid , then Manny landing in New York because the Yanks offered the most money .
And when it happens , his new teammates will spend an inordinate amount of time trying to figure him out .
They will like him .
They will make fun of him .
They will ride his hot streaks for weeks at a time .
Within a few months , they might even swipe his credit card for a night on the town , planning to charge drinks to their idiot teammate all night .
Someone else will get stuck with the bill .
Manny will drink for free .
Everyone will have a good laugh , and they will never underestimate Manny Ramirez again .

Politics
Why we all need the Democrats to abandon gun control
At this year 's annual Gun Rights Policy Conference in September , National Rifle Association President Sandy Froman endorsed Arizona Sen .
John McCain in the upcoming presidential election .
This came as no surprise ; the Democrats have long been denounced by the NRA as the anti-Second Amendment party — Nanny - State know - it - alls , Big-Government gun-controllers out of touch with the majority of Americans , yearning to impose their vision on a population that wants none of it .
In this election , however , it 's not that simple .
The U.S. is facing a host of challenges , most of them brought on by the antics of a Republican administration that governed as a team of mendacious plunderers , with no regard for the future , or even for the beliefs that their own party once espoused .
The Constitution — the very document that guarantees the right to keep and bear arms — has been treated with scorn .
The economy , manipulated by the kind of " crony capitalism " we once despised in less - enlightened nations , is a shambles , at least for the middle class , and our energy policies are the laughingstock of the developed world .
Today 's Republicans are not just the party of the Second Amendment ; they are also the party of the big energy companies .
Is it possible , then , that gun-rights advocates might consider voting for someone who is not a Republican ?
It 's unlikely , unless the Democrats start acknowledging the gun vote and respecting the views of Second Amendment proponents .
Gun owners represent at least 4 million of the nation 's most dedicated voters .
Election after election , they help change the outcome , sometimes electing politicians who are inept , corrupt or unabashed lackeys of corporate interests — people whose only appeal to gun owners is that they promise to leave the Second Amendment alone .
Now , however , the Second Amendment is more resistant to those politicians who might want to mess with it .
The Supreme Court 's recent Heller decision just declared Washington , D.C. 's restrictive firearms laws unconstitutional , thus weakening the power of state and local politicians to control guns or limit gun ownership .
Given that — and given what is at stake in the U.S. today — it may be time for Democratic and independent voters to simply give up on gun control .
We have so many more pressing issues to deal with .
For two decades , many liberals have thrived on despising the NRA and its members .
Those who believe in gun control often hold enormous prejudice against those who do n't .
But there are already reams of laws pertaining to the use , abuse , purchase and sale of firearms .
What new regulations would the gun-controllers create , and how would they work to address the problem of gun violence ?
Do they want to prohibit private ownership of firearms altogether ?
Many would like to ban handguns , without considering just what this would entail , what inequities of power would result , and what new , potentially dangerous , powers would have to be awarded to government to accomplish it .
Like activists who want to ban pit bulls , the gun-control advocates remain relentlessly unspecific about what they hope to achieve .
It has become clear , too , that these advocates hold a double standard regarding the U.S. Constitution :
The First Amendment is vital to the health of a free nation , as is the Fourth , but the Second is respected only by the un-evolved and the violent .
Only the parts of the Constitution that their side respects are valid , in this view .
According to Dave Workman , the senior editor of GunWeek , a publication of the Bellevue , Wash . - based Second Amendment Foundation , " The Clinton - era ' assault weapons ban ' was more symbolic than anything else .
The reason it was so overwhelmingly supported by the gun control movement was because it represented a federal ban on firearms based on cosmetic circumstances — what they looked like — not on their lethality .
It was to condition the public to accept a piecemeal destruction of the Second Amendment . "
Workman believes there was much to learn from the Clinton election .
" When George H. W. Bush took the gun vote for granted in 1992 , most of the gun owners voted for Ross Perot , or else they sat it out , " he says .
The election of Clinton , though , and what followed , cemented the gun voters ' dislike of the Democratic Party .
The Brady Law went into effect in 1993 , and the " assault weapons ban " passed a year later .
That was enough , says Workman , for the gun voters to see " how this was all going .
They mobilized and threw out many of the Democrats , costing them control of Congress ( in 1994 ) . "
The National Rifle Association first endorsed a presidential candidate — Ronald Reagan — in 1980 , but gun politics as we know them today were born in 1994 .
Since then , the gun vote has gone to the Republicans , and that is not expected to change anytime soon , even with pro-gun Democrats like Montana 's Gov. Brian Schweitzer or Sen.
Jon Tester gaining prominence .
" It is not that the gun vote will not cross party lines , " Workman said .
" We know that there are a lot of pro-gun Democrats now , and we are not the one - mind , one - thought Neanderthals that many liberals believe us to be .
But the Republican party remains the party of the gun owners , because the most entrenched Democrats are the old - left , dust - gathering anti-gun , anti-liberty politicians , and when the Democrats have a majority , it puts those people in charge . "
Tom Gresham , host of the radio show Gun Talk , recognizes that there are dire problems with the Republican Party .
Still , he refuses to vote for a Democrat .
" I am proud to be a single - issue voter , and I will not cast a vote to strengthen the party of Nancy Pelosi .
Let 's look at what it means when any politician says that it is okay to take away any of the gun rights of a law - abiding citizen .
It means that they truly believe that we are too childlike to be trusted with those rights , and it means that their attitude of government is that it will protect us from any and every peril .
Tangentially , it also means that they want all the power . "

BAGHDAD — Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki ’s ruling Shiite coalition withheld support today for the proposed security pact that would keep U.S. troops here for three more years , dealing a setback to American hopes of a speedy approval of the agreement .
The statement by the United Iraqi Alliance called for unspecified changes to the draft agreement , which parliament must ratify by the end of the year when the U.N. mandate expires .
The group ’s move comes a day after tens of thousands of demonstrators , mostly Shiites , took to the streets of Baghdad to show their opposition to the agreement .
The Shiite alliance holds 85 of parliament ’s 275 seats and al - Maliki needs solid support from the alliance to win approval of the agreement by a strong majority .
The 30 lawmakers loyal to anti-American Shiite cleric Muqtada al - Sadr have already said they will vote against the agreement , and some Sunni lawmakers have spoken out against it too .
In its statement , the alliance said the agreement , hammered out in months of difficult negotiations , contained some “ positive points ” but more time was needed “ for discussion , dialogue and to amend some of its articles . ”
The alliance established a committee to solicit views and study the agreement in detail , the statement added .
The alliance did not specify what it considered positive or negative , and Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari warned it would be difficult to reopen negotiations .
Hassan al - Suneid , a member of the alliance from al - Maliki ’s party , said members had reservations about portions “ that do n’t comply with Iraq ’s sovereignty . ”
“ We cannot talk today about rejection or acceptance in the absolute , ” al - Suneid told The Associated Press .
“ There are weak and strong points , ” including a timeline for the departure of American troops .
The agreement provides for American troops to leave Baghdad and other Iraqi cities by the end of June and withdraw from the country entirely by the end of 2011 unless the government asks them to stay .
It would also give Iraq limited authority to prosecute U.S .
soldiers and contractors for crimes committed off post and off duty , limit U.S. authority to search homes and detain people and give Iraqis more say in the conduct of American military operations .
Some lawmakers complained the language in the draft was vague , especially those governing U.S. military operations and legal jurisdiction over American troops and contractors .
Although the alliance did not reject the accord outright , the review process within a coalition whose leaders negotiated the accord could well mean that parliament will not vote on the agreement until after the Nov. 4 U.S. election .
Many Iraqi lawmakers say privately they still need U.S. troops because the Iraqi military and police alone are incapable of handling security nationwide despite the sharp drop in violence since last year .
But approval has been complicated by next year ’s provincial and national elections , as well as the narrow partisan interests , sectarian and ethnic divisions that have defined Iraqi politics since the 2003 collapse of Saddam Hussein .
Iraqi politicians fear positions they take on the security pact will determine how they will fare at the ballot box , since many voters are anxious to see U.S. troops leave .
Iraqi control of their own country is a burning issue in a nation that once saw itself as the beacon of pan-Arab nationalism .
Furthermore , many Shiite politicians have close ties to neighboring Iran , where they lived in exile during Saddam ’s rule .
Shiite - dominated Iran strongly opposes the agreement .
Today , Iranian Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki said Washington ’s plan for a security deal with Iraq was futile because Iraqis “ have announced their opposition ” to the deal , the official Islamic Republic News Agency reported from Tehran .
The pact with the U.S. is expected to serve as a model for a separate agreement on the future of the 4,100 British troops in Iraq as well as the handful of other countries that remain in the coalition .
Al - Maliki said today he would appoint a team soon to start discussions with Britain .
“ It is the time to build the best relationships with the countries that stood with Iraq against dictatorship in order to build a modern state , ” al - Maliki said in a statement after meeting with British Defense Secretary John Hutton .
Al - Maliki told The Times of London last week that British forces are no longer necessary to provide security but there may be a need for a few of them for training and technical issues .
Despite security improvements , attacks continue , albeit at their lowest levels in four years .
Two bombs exploded today near separate Iraqi police in the Shiite - dominated southeast Baghdad neighborhood of Zafaraniya , killing two people and wounding a total of 17 , police and hospital officials said .
The U.S. military reported two dead and two wounded and blamed Shiite extremists .
In the north , Turkish warplanes today bombed Kurdish rebel hideouts inside Iraqi territory , according to an Iraqi Kurdish official .
Helgurv Khider , an official of the semiautonomous Kurdish region in northern Iraq , said the bombings targeted four towns near the Turkish border .
He gave no information on possible casualties .
There was no immediate Turkish military confirmation of the airstrikes .
The military has carried out a series of air raids against suspected positions in northern Iraq used by Kurdish rebels to stage attacks across the border in Turkey .
Attacks have escalated since Kurdish rebels killed 17 soldiers on Oct. 3 .
Well , maybe Palin herself is n't one , but she does " pal around " with them .
Dozens , perhaps hundreds , of them .
Despite our many differences of opinion , I 'm sure there is one thing that Sarah Palin and I could agree on : a domestic terrorist ( i.e. one who encourages violence against the government or the citizens of the U.S. ) should not be given a national audience on mainstream , public airwaves .
That 's why I 'm requesting that you join me in contacting the Saturday Night Live studio and asking them not to have Sarah Palin on their show .
You see , when Sarah Palin started suggesting that Barack Obama is a domestic terrorist because he served on two of the same nonprofits boards as Bill Ayers , a professor at the distinguished University of Illinois at Chicago and former 60's radical , the crowd began to shout things like " terrorist " and " kill him " in regards to Obama .
Finding support among like - minded individuals and indifference from rally officials , the crowds grew ever bolder in showing their racist hatred of Obama .
Meanwhile Palin and her staff did nothing to discourage the crowd from such comments and chants .
Instead , Palin gave one of her trademark folksy " Aww shucks ... you guys ! " expressions .
In recent days John McCain has tried to distance himself from the shouts of hate coming from the crowd , but only after he began to suffer a black eye in the press over it .
When he called Obama a " decent person " , his own supporters began to boo him .
Did McCain really expect that he could put the lid back on the Pandora 's box of bigotry and hatred he opened ?
Sarah Palin however continues unabated .
In fact , it has been reported that McCain and Palin have even tussled over the issue .
McCain , perhaps realizing defeat , wants to go out with what little honor he has left ( which , in my opinion , is none ) .
Palin on the other hand is drunk on the enthusiasm of her radical right supporters .
The angry mob she whips up at her rallies seems to enforce in her the idea that she is somehow the savior of her party .
Now if you , I , or anyone else made a threat against a Presidential candidate , even in jest , the Secret Service would take it very seriously .
It 's kind of like how you can't joke about a bomb at the airport .
In some situations and places , the joke is just not funny .
By applying Palin 's flawless logic , because she associates with these people , even in a very indirect way , she must be a domestic terrorist herself .
Therefore we must act according to the wisdom she has passed down to all of us and demand that 1 ) she explain her association to these people ( even if she already has ; apparently it has to be done over and over again ) , and 2 ) call or e-mail SNL in order to deny her a national audience where she can spread her terrorist ideas .
Recently rumors have surfaced that the McCain campaign has contacted Saturday Night Live about Palin being on the show .
The goal is to show that Palin is a likable person who is in on the joke , doggone it , rather than being the joke .
That 's why I 'm serious about contacting SNL and so are a lot of other people .
A movement has been started to give Palin a taste of her own medicine .
Simply call or e-mail the following and say something like :
" Because Sarah Palin has refused to disassociate herself from or denounce her supporters who have been shouting threats like ' kill him ' in regards to Barack Obama at her rallies , I am respectfully asking that you refuse to have her on Saturday Night Live . "
E-mail SNL 's producer Lorne Michaels at [ email protected ]

Starbucks Wasting More Than 6 Million Gallons of Water a Day Starbucks lets water run nonstop , wasting 6 m gallons of water every day .
LONDON , Oct. 6 , 2008 -- American coffee giant Starbucks became the target of conservationists today after an investigation by the U.K. newspaper
The Sun estimated that the company wasted up to 6 million gallons of water every day , enough to quell the thirst of a small African nation .
As part of a company policy aimed at preventing germ buildup in its taps , Starbucks stores are directed to keep water running constantly into a sink , called a dipper well , to clean utensils and wash away food residue , The Sun reported .
As a result of running water all day , every day at each of the company 's 10,000 worldwide coffee emporiums , Starbucks wastes water in an amount The Sun estimated to be " enough daily water for the entire 2 million strong population of drought - hit Namibia in Africa or fill an Olympic pool every 83 minutes . "
The investigation was launched after a couple who spotted a running tap at a U.K .
Starbucks were told by a store employee that it was left on to clean the pipes .
They contacted Starbucks head office to find out more and later received a letter confirming that it was company policy to keep water constantly running into the dipper wells .
The Sun investigation spanned several Starbucks locations in the United Kingdom , including stores in London , Manchester and Birmingham , as well as in New York , Los Angeles , Beijing and Sydney .
The practice of leaving taps on during operating hours was consistent in every location ;
The Sun reported that staff members were banned from turning the water off .
In a statement to ABC News , the company confirmed that " the dipper well system currently in use in Starbucks retail stores ensures that we meet or exceed our own and local health standards . "
" Starbucks ' challenge is to balance water conservation with the need for customer safety , " the statement said .
So does leaving the water on actually make germ buildup less likely ?
" They do n't need to keep the tap on all the time . …
A couple of minutes of running water should [ clean the tap ] , " Jacob Tompkins of Waterwise , a nonprofit organization that focuses on decreasing U.K. water consumption , told ABCNews.com .
" You do n't keep the water running at home . "
The water wastage seems an anomaly for a company that prides itself on its environmental record .
In its mission statement posted on the company 's Web site , Starbucks claims that it has a commitment to " understand environmental issues , to strive to buy , sell and use environmentally - friendly products , and to instill environmental responsibility as a corporate value . "
Apart from the wastage itself , there are potentially other environmental effects .
Tompkins said the energy used to pump water from the ground and treat it increases the carbon footprint of the entire operation .
While the company states it is in compliance with the World Health Organization , the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and European Union standards , Starbucks admitted that " the opportunity exists to reduce our total water usage . "
Tompkins said , " It 's really good that they have customer health in mind , " but he added that there are other ways to ensure cleanliness and hygiene in its stores .
Tompkins said the aim of his organization is to " reduce waste , not restrict use " and noted that Starbucks deserved credit for its " really good customer health record . "
But he also offered some advice on how Starbucks could reduce its water waste and still ensure its stated commitment to customer safety .
He said the company could cut water use when the stores are not extremely busy and also look into ways of " lowering the flow " of water , such as aerating nozzles .
" They can do a water audit and discuss [ it ] with their staff , " he said .
In the statement to ABC News , Starbucks said it has tested more environmentally - friendly ways to maintain its hygiene , including using an ice bath and eliminating spoons altogether .
" Neither of these alternatives was successful , " the statement said .
Starbucks stated that other methods are " currently under consideration , " including using dishwashers to clean their utensils .
" We continue to routinely re-evaluate our equipment , store design and training opportunities to reduce our overall water use with the goal of ultimately reducing our environmental footprint , " the company said .
Constitutional Peril : The Life and Death Struggle for Our Constitution and Democracy
Bruce Fein
Palgrave / Macmillan , 2008
238 pp .
The presidential election is almost upon us , and the candidates have been talking about all sorts of critical issues , such as who wears a flag pin , pays for travel for a candidate ’s children , associates with bad people , and is friends with Joe the Plumber .
Actually , there are more important issues at stake .
In Constitutional Peril , Bruce Fein , a former Reagan administration appointee , warns that the very future of constitutional governance is at stake .
The problem is not a threatened attack from without , but the erosion of limits on government and safeguards for liberty from within .
He reminds us that " Eternal vigilance is the minimum price of liberty , " but the state of the presidential campaign is merely additional evidence that the American people , and most of those seeking to lead them , are anything but vigilant .
He laments : " The probability that the current tides daily eroding the constitution can be reversed is slim . "
Fein starts with a bang .
He advocates impeaching the president or risk " a degeneration of the US Constitution into executive despotism . "
Strong language , but the powers claimed by the Bush administration have been extraordinary .
Indeed , the president contended that the Authorization for Use of Military Force ( AUMF ) , approved by Congress in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of 9/11 , also gave him essentially any power short of going to war , such as warrantless surveillance of American citizens and designation of American citizens as enemy combatants .
Fein takes his analysis a frightening step further .
If the president ’s argument is correct , what power does he not possess ?
Fein writes :
" This means that , among other things , the AUMF empowers President Bush to use the American military to kill any individuals in the United States whom he declares were complicit in the terrorist acts committed on 9/11  on his say - so alone .
In other words , the president is not required to supply evidence to a neutral or detached magistrate establishing reasonable cause for his belief that the target of the planned killing is a terrorist before employing lethal force .
For example , if the president suspects that a dozen ‘ high value ’ al - Qaeda adherents are living in a suburban Los Angeles home , the AUMF authorizes him to order an aerial bombardment of the residence to kill its occupants .
If the president ’s suspicions are later proved wrong  as they were regarding the stockpiling of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq before the US invasion of March 2003 ; the numerous erroneous detentions at Guantanamo Bay , verified by the Defense Department ’s voluntary release of hundreds of suspected unlawful enemy combatant detainees since September 11 , 2001 ; and a June , 23 , 2008 , federal appeals court decision nullifying an unlawful enemy combatant finding  the homicides would still be considered legal . "
This is America ?
President Bush has not gone so far to level suburban neighborhoods across America , but it is the theory under which he has been governing .
Thus , according to this administration , explains Fein , " if a power can be classified as ‘ executive , ’ then neither the legislative nor judicial branch may regulate , oversee , or check the president ’s actions . "
It is , frankly , a preposterous argument , contradicting the intentions and actions of America ’s Founders .
They drafted the Constitution to disperse power to ensure that it was always checked , bounded , and constrained .
How , asks Fein , " is President Bush ’s unitary executive theory different from self - coronation ? "
Even the war power , so closely associated with the president , is divided .
Congress is to decide on whether there is a war for the president to manage .
Congress establishes the military .
Congress approves the rules of war .
Congress provides the funding for war .
In short , Congress is the dominant player even in this area .
But not in the view of the Bush administration , and its legal acolytes within the conservative Greek Chorus .
Yet despite abuses so obvious and pervasive , Congress , under both Democratic and Republican control , has done little to restrain the executive branch .
Rather , Fein notes , " Congress has augmented the Bush - Cheney embrace of despotic powers through the Military Commissions Act of 2006 , the Protect America Act of 2007 , the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act Amendment of 2008 , and the John Warner National Defense Authorization Act of 2006 . "
This explains Fein ’s extreme pessimism .
Congress has the constitutional authority to check the executive , but it lacks the political will .
Even worse , the American people seem disinterested in protecting their liberties .
Notes Fein : " the American people are more culpable than Congress over the nation ’s constitutional peril because they have declined to exercise their right to vote or their First Amendment right to petition Congress for a redress of grievances to demand corrective legislation or impeachment to end the Bush - Cheney transgressions . "
An air of near desperation pervades Constitutional Peril .
Fein details prior precedents of executive branch lawlessness .
He parses the complicated controversy over the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act , originally approved by Congress to limit prior presidential misconduct but ignored by President Bush .
He spends a chapter on the critical topic of government secrecy , so important for the executive branch to hide illegal behavior .
He notes : " President George W. Bush has reveled in secret government by invoking executive privilege or state secrets to frustrate congressional or private oversight of executive - branch actions  for example , the manipulation of US attorneys to skew law enforcement or secret spying programs that invade the privacy of Americans and , in the case of the Terrorist Surveillance Program ( TSP ) , are flagrantly criminal . "
He also discusses " extraordinary rendition , " by which the US turns people over to allied states to be tortured , as well as military commissions , which have won few convictions despite being designed to ensure prosecution victories .
The point is not that the government cannot defend America from people who mean the country ill , but that the steps taken must be consistent with American law and principles , and should be effective .
Most foolish of all have been policies , such as torture , which have yielded little security gain while wrecking America ’s reputation abroad .
Fein ’s judgment of the Bush administration is harsh , but no other conclusion is possible .
Who else  whether Abraham Lincoln , Woodrow Wilson , Franklin Delano Roosevelt , Lyndon Johnson , or Richard Nixon  has come close in executive misconduct ?
Writes Fein :
" President Bush has kidnapped , imprisoned , and tortured suspected terrorists abroad .
He has created a climate of lawlessness in the executive branch , which emboldened CIA officials to destroy interrogation videotapes sought by the 9/11 Commission or Congress that probably provided ocular evidence of torture .
He has signed bills passed by Congress while announcing his intent to disregard provisions that he maintains are unconstitutional  for example , a provision denying funds to establish permanent military bases in Iraq .
He has asserted the power to break and enter homes , open mail , kidnap and torture to gather foreign intelligence without review by any other branch .
He has tacitly declared that every square inch of the United States is a battlefield appropriate for military force and military law because al - Qaeda hopes to kill Americans anywhere , and terrorists can blend into civilian populations . "
All the while the president ’s policies actually have made Americans less safe .
Quite an achievement for not yet eight years in office .
Although Fein occasionally ranges over the top  for instance , he compares the philosophies of the bloody Grenadian dictator Maurice Bishop and President Bush  our republic truly is at risk .
The danger comes not from the usual ruffians at the extremes of the political system , but seemingly respectable politicians , activists , and bureaucrats who insist that their powers must be enhanced and our freedoms must be sacrificed in order to protect us from dangers that only they recognize and understand .
It is the same Siren call heard throughout history that has led to the destruction of so many liberal societies .
Ultimately , the American people can’t rely on anyone but themselves to preserve their liberty .
Writes Fein : " Everyone in a democracy is thus burdened with a moral duty to act as a sentinel for the liberty of everyone else .
At present , the majority of citizens are neglecting their duty . "
If not us , who ?
If not now , when ?
The time to act is short .
Fein presents an emergency manifesto that should be heeded by all patriots and lovers of liberty .
The pilot episode of a new science show , Chemical Explorers , is oozing information about fuel cells and catalysts , and it makes several complicated chemistry concepts easy to understand .
It will take you into the Nocera lab at MIT , where postdoctoral scholar Matt Kanan has developed a remarkable new material for hydrogen production .
That substance , a cobalt catalyst , reduces the amount of energy that is necessary to break water molecules , and could be the solution to a longstanding problem : how to safely and efficiently feed fuel cells .
Since it is quite explosive , carrying huge tanks of hydrogen in your car would be dangerous .
In theory , it would be possible to bring a jug of water instead and produce little bits of the gas on demand .
By passing an electrical current through the ubiquitous liquid , anyone can make tiny bubbles of the earth - friendly fuel , but it takes a lot of energy to do that .
When one of the electrodes is covered with a thin layer of the nifty black substance , breaking hydrogen - oxygen bonds becomes much easier .
So easy that the feeble current provided by a solar cell can do it .
If Nocera and his team can further improve upon the catalyst , we may start to see a lot of fuel cells on the road .
Although the first installment of Chemical Explorers , which aired on Monday , feels like a news segment , it has a timeless quality and thus could be a useful part of science lessons for years to come .
Crammed with fancy graphics and footage from within a lab at MIT , the new show makes chalkboards seem as obsolete as fossil fuels .

NEW YORK ( MarketWatch ) --
Major bond dealers say the United States may have to issue more than $ 1 trillion in debt during its current fiscal year , by far the most ever , to fund massive programs designed to bail out the banking system .
That would be a " staggering " increase from recent years , said Michael Cloherty , an interest - rate strategist at Bank of America Corp. , one of the 17 primary government - security dealers required to bid at Treasury auctions .
The Treasury Department will announce Monday how much of that full - year borrowing it anticipates selling in the first half of the government 's 2009 fiscal year , which began this month .
“ ' This year 's financing needs will be unprecedented . ' ” — Anthony Ryan , U.S. Treasury
In its past fiscal year ended September , the government sold $ 724 billion in notes , bonds and inflation - indexed debt , according to Wrightson ICAP , a research firm specializing in government finance .
If the debt issue swells to $ 1 trillion , as Barclays Capital , Credit Suisse and others anticipate , the issuance would represent a 38 % increase in one year .
" This year 's financing needs will be unprecedented , " the Treasury 's acting undersecretary for domestic finance , Anthony Ryan , said Tuesday .
The Treasury gave its last quarterly estimate in July , before the government took conservatorship of mortgage giants Fannie Mae FNM , and Freddie Mac FRE , - 0.33 % , and Congress passed a $ 700 billion package to buy bad assets from financial institutions and inject capital into struggling banks .
At that time , it said it expected to borrow $ 142 billion in this quarter .
Also since that earlier estimate , the Federal Reserve has ramped up its multiple programs designed to ease strains in short - term lending markets by loaning out Treasurys and increasing currency swaps with other central banks so they could loan dollars .
These programs will pressure the Treasury to offer more debt more frequently and by using different types of securities , according to analysts .
One unknown is how much it will have to pay up for all this debt .
A good time to borrow ?
So far , the government has been getting a deal when it taps investors because of the credit crisis and anxiety about losses in equities , commodities and global assets .
Treasury yields are near multiyear lows as investors have sought the relative safety they offer .
The lower yields go , the less the government pays to finance its programs .
" The debt is going into really good hands because everybody is looking for the safest , government - guaranteed paper , given the stock - market turmoil and weak economy , " said Alex Li , interest - rate strategist at primary dealer Credit Suisse .
The government 's longest - term debt , the 30 - year bond TMUBMUSD30Y , 1.425 % , touched an all - time low below 4 % in October .
Yields on 2 - year notes TMUBMUSD02Y , 0.125 % , the traditional beneficiary of safe - haven bids , remain near the lowest in decades .
Foreign investors , which hold a little more than half of all U.S. debt in the market , have shown no signs of a curbed appetite .
They have increased purchases of Treasurys as other forms of debt and equities have been falling .
Current low yields may not last , however .
Bond analysts and investors are worried because more issuance tends to mean higher yields , since more supply reduces the value of current holdings .
" We see the tables really turning hard against the Treasury market " as Treasury borrowing rises " meteorically " past $ 1.5 trillion , said William O'Donnell , U.S. government bond strategist at primary dealer UBS Securities .
Compounding pressures , the Treasury will take out this large tab as an economic slowdown is likely to reduce tax receipts to the government , lowering the amount it has to cover more regular expenses .
“ ' We see the tables really turning hard against the Treasury market . ' ” — William O'Donnell , UBS Securities
Analysts also note that lawmakers are considering another stimulus package of some form , which may add $ 150 billion to $ 300 billion to the government 's debt load .
Odd denominations could make a comeback
The Treasury is likely to raise cash by expanding its borrowing needs each month at least for this year .
So far , the Treasury has been issuing more bills , the shortest debt vehicle , to deposit at the Fed for it to loan out , but will need to issue longer - term debt as the bills mature .
Increased debt sales are likely to start with November 's quarterly sales of 10 - year notes and 30 - year bonds TMUBMUSD30Y , 1.425 % .
Borrowing levels are already near 40 - year highs :
The Treasury 's monthly sales of 2 - year and 5 - year notes are the biggest since the Treasury began issuing securities regularly in the 1970s .
Primary dealers also expect longer - term debt to be sold more often , such as selling 10 - year notes TMUBMUSD10Y , 0.651 % monthly .
The government also may reintroduce other maturities that it stopped selling when the government was n't running such a big deficit .
Ryan said Tuesday that it may resume selling 3 - year notes , last sold in May 2007 .
The 7 - year note also may make a comeback after a 15 - year absence , analysts added .
The Treasury already asked its 17 dealers about what timing , sizing and maturities of debt could be best absorbed by the marketplace .
That input always goes into how much it sells in its quarterly refunding , which it will announce on Nov. 5 .
Short seller Douglas Kass has won his relatively short - term bet against Warren Buffett .
Given Buffett 's decades - long track record as the world 's greatest investor , he does n't lose very often .
In March , Kass listed 11 Reasons to Short Berkshire on TheStreet.com .
( Going ' short ' is , in effect , a bet that a particular stock will go down in price , not up . )
Kass , who is president of Seabreeze Partners Management , generated some headlines in May when he discussed his short position in an interview with Barron's .
Hecited Buffett 's " recent investment - style drift " that had left him " immersed ... in several large and thus far unprofitable derivative transactions . "
Kass also talked about weakness in Berkshire 's insurance businesses , Buffett 's exposure to financials , and the weak housing market .
Plus , he pointed out , Buffett wo n't be running Berkshire forever and " investors are going to dump the shares if Buffett is no longer at the helm . "
In an appearance on CNBC a few days later , Kass told Larry Kudlow :
" Yogi Berra once said , ' Even Napoleon had his Watergate . ' ( Laughs . )
And in the case of Warren Buffett , his Watergate is an investment - style drift which is really a no - no in the money management business ...
You have to stick to your knitting ...
Look , I worship at the knee of Warren Buffett and all he 's accomplished over the years .
But the reality is in the last decade he 's underperformed dramatically and he 's drifted in terms of strategy . "
Then in June , Kass wrote that he had added to his short position , citing " bombs in Buffett 's book . "
He pointed to " poor short - term and long - term charts " for four of Berkshire 's biggest stock holdings : Coca - Cola , Wells Fargo , Kraft , and American Express .
( Only Wells Fargo has gained ground since then . )
Kass 's endorsement this week of Buffett 's high - profile call to buy U.S. stocks prompted us to ask him if he 's still short Berkshire .
In an email reply , Kass told us he first shorted Berkshire in February of this year , when the shares were trading around $ 145,000 , " as there was no ' margin of safety ' against my calculation of intrinsic value . "
And he revealed , " I am no longer short Berkshire Hathaway - I covered my short position around $ 115,000 / share in August as it fulfilled my price objective on the downside . "
That ’s right folks , if you were lucky enough to stumble across this article , you have the privilege of seeing the latest technology in automated agriculture at work .
This invaluable tool comes all the way from Belarus , a country that apparently spares no effort when it comes to investing in new technology .
This revolutionary agricultural device is a state - of - the - art cucumber harvester that uses the newly discovered power of people on their bellies .
That ’s right , people sitting on their bellies being pulled by a tractor .
It ’s simple and effective and I for one ca n’t wait to get my hands on one , cucumber harvesting will never be the same again .
I wish I lived in Belarus ( sigh ) .
UPDATE 2 : After waking up this morning and reading my email , I 've noticed that there are at least 2 variants of a worm spreading using the MS08 - 067 vulnerability .
One of the variants spreads through exploit and through at least one P2P Network ( Emule ) .
From what I can see , there is scanning that takes place on port 139 to find other machines , and the exploit takes place over port 445 .
This is the primary method of spreading .
I would suggest , if you have n't already , to block these ports at your outer firewall .
That will keep it from getting in via network exploitation , now you just have to worry about things like VPN users , people bringing it in from home on their laptops , etc .
All the usual suspects .
Make sure your systems are fully patched , make sure you have the latest virus definitions , make sure your firewalls are secure , make sure your IDSs are updated to detect the threat .
I think these are the first couple worms in a series of worms that we will see , each getting more sophisticated .
So , unless something new comes up , I wo n't update this diary entry anymore .
UPDATE 1 : The " Worm " appears to be spreading over local network .
Port 445 .
Speaking from a Snort perspective , as pointed out in the VRT blog , not only does this worm trigger off of the new rules that Sourcefire has written for Snort for the newest 08-067 vulnerability , but this particular variant of the worm triggers an older rule that VRT wrote for 06-040 .
( Since this worm uses one of the milw0rm exploits ) .
1:7224 .
I took a pcap that we received of the worm traffic on port 445 ran it through Snort .
The following rules alerted :
[ 1:7224:8 ] NETBIOS SMB - DS srvsvc NetrPathCanonicalize unicode little endian overflow attempt
[ 3:14817:1 ] NETBIOS SMB srvsvc NetrpPathCononicalize unicode little endian path cononicalization stack overflow attempt
[ 3:14783:1 ] NETBIOS DCERPC NCACN-IP -TCP srvsvc NetrpPathCononicalize little endian path cononicalization stack overflow attempt
The first one is the 06-040 rule that I was telling you about above , the send two are shared object rules written for this vulnerability .
The rules are available here .
Stay tuned , as I will attempt to keep you updated .

Ubuntu , the open source GNU / Linux based operating system , is about to release its next big update - Intrepid Ibex .
In the past , the update servers would crash very quickly on a big release day , making it hard for people to get the latest update .
With BitTorrent , however , this can be easily avoided .
Most users of Linux based operating systems such as Ubuntu are familiar with BitTorrent .
In fact , Ubuntu even comes with a BitTorrent client , and millions of Ubuntu users got their install disk via the popular filesharing protocol .
When it comes to upgrading their OS , however , most users still rely on Ubuntu ’s central servers .
Because of this , the servers are overloaded with upgrade requests every time a big update is released , which often causes them to crash .
The next Ubuntu update , version 8.10 aka Intrepid Ibex is scheduled to be released this week , and since the OS is more popular than ever , updating might be troublesome .
There is an easy solution to this problem though .
One that not only prevents the Ubuntu servers from crashing , but also speeds up the update progress , because it uses BitTorrent .
A bunch of TorrentFreak readers were kind enough to write a basic tutorial to guide you through the upgrade process , which we have posted below .
Update to Ubuntu ‘ Intrepid Ibex ’ using BitTorrent
Step 1 : Setting sources .
list to a close - local mirror
First off , it ’s definitely recommended to reset to a local mirror .
This way , you will download any needed files from a closer and supposedly faster source .
Either do an auto-check : System -> Administration -> Software Sources -> Download From : -> Other ->
Select Best Server
( It ’ll run a couple hundred tests ( takes less than five minutes ) and select the best mirror for you .
Make sure to remember which mirror it is , because you will need that later . )
Or select your local mirror yourself according to your country .
Step 2 : Disable 3rd Parties repositories
It is also very much recommended to disable 3rd party repositories !
If you do n’t know exactly what you are doing , go to the 3rd Parties tab and deselect all of the entries there .
Step 3 : Install apt -p2p
Next you need to install “ apt - p2 p ” .
Version 0.2.5 is needed because of a major bug in older versions .
This is beta software , so it might not be stable for everybody .
If it ca n’t download the file via BitTorrent , however , it will revert to http download .
As apt - p2 p is not in the hardy repos yet , we have to fetch it from a server directly .
Below I have have two scripts for 32 - bit and 64 - bit .
Use the one that matches your OS .
For 32 bit versions use this script , and for 64 bit versions use this script .
Save the script file as “ apt - p2p.sh ” on your desktop .
Then open a terminal ( Applications > System > Terminal ) and issue these commands ( you ’ll be prompted for your user password ) :
cd ~/ Desktop
sudo sh apt - p2p.sh
The scripts will create a apt - p2 p folder in the / temp folder , enter that folder and download apt - p2 p from the intrepid repositories ( they work fine on hardy ) , including all dependencies .
Finally , it will install everything in the required order .
Step 4 : Prepare the sources.
list
Once installed type the following :
sudo cp /etc/apt/sources.list
/etc/apt/sources.list-apt-p2p-backup
gksudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list
Now you are looking at the sources .
list file for Ubuntu ; this specifies which servers to contact for updates and new programs .
You should see a bunch of lines that look similar to this :
deb http://archive.canonical.com/ubuntu hardy partner
deb-src http://archive.canonical.com/ubuntu hardy partner
deb http://*mirror-address*/ubuntu/
hardy main universe restricted multiverse
deb-src http://*mirror-address*/ubuntu/
hardy main universe restricted multiverse
where ** mirror - address ** is the address of the mirror you chose earlier .
Do n’t worry , you may not have all of these , and you may have more .
However , you only want to change ones that are similar to these .
You want to change these to look like this :
deb http://localhost:9977/archive.canonical.com/ubuntu hardy partner
deb-src http://localhost:9977/archive.canonical.com/ubuntu hardy partner
deb http://localhost:9977/*mirror-address*/ubuntu/
hardy main universe restricted multiverse
deb-src http://localhost:9977/*mirror-address*/ubuntu/
hardy main universe restricted multiverse
So basically just insert “ localhost:9977 ” after the “ http : / / ” .
Now close the program and save the file .
Note :
If you messed anything up , go back to the terminal and run this command :
sudo cp /etc/apt/sources.list-apt-p2p-backup
/etc/apt/sources.list
This WILL overwrite your sources .
list file with your backup and we are almost done !
Step 5 : Update the packages & upgrade to Intrepid
Back at the terminal , type the following command :
sudo apt - get update
This will update the list of software , as well as fully integrate apt - p2 p .
If you get any errors , run the following commands ( Warning :
If not done carefully , these commands could destroy your system ) :
sudo rm - rf /var / cache / apt-p2p/cache /*
sudo apt - get update
Once everything looks okay , you ’ll want to forward the ports for apt - p2 p to your system ( if you have a router , see http://portforward.com, port for apt - p2p is 9977 TCP and UDP ) .
At this point , you ’re all set to receive regular updates via BitTorrent .
If you want to upgrade to Intrepid ahead of time you may type one of the following commands in the terminal :
sudo update - manager -d
Click on the “ upgrade ” button on the top right of that window and follow the wizard .
When asked , that no valid mirror was found and whether it shall replace hardy with intrepid , then select “ Yes ” .
or use
sudo apt - get dist - upgrade
Note :
When issuing a “ dist- upgrade ” in the terminal you will first need to manually alter the entries in the sources .
list from “ hardy ” to “ intrepid ” .
Now you ’re all set , and by using BitTorrent to update Ubuntu you will be updated much faster , and help relieve the strain on the update servers on launch day .
As always , tips and suggestions are welcome in the comments .
From the “ you ca n’t make this up ” file , a McCain foreign policy adviser claimed today that the candidate ’s decades - long interest in Latin America is exemplified by the fact that he had a girlfriend in Brazil 50 years ago while he was in the Navy :
Speaking at an Americas Conference panel discussion Friday on the next U.S. president ’s Latin American policy , McCain advisor Richard Fontaine started out by mentioning an old Brazilian flame of McCain ’s , who recently emerged in the press .
” Talking a little about his personal experience , he was famously born in Panama and has traveled all over the hemisphere for many years . ”
Fontaine said .
“ In fact , I saw , I guess it was last week , that his old girlfriend in Brazil has been found from his early days when he was in the Navy and was interviewed .
She ’s a somewhat older woman now than she was then , but it sorta speaks to the long experience he has had in the region — in the most positive terms . ”
Fontaine was referring to former model Maria Gracinda Teixeira de Jesus , who recently gave an interview to O Globo saying the former sailor was quite the kisser .
According to McCain ’s memoirs , ` Faith of My Fathers , ` they met in 1957 , when his ship , the USS Hunt docked in Brazil .
” I called him John but also my darling and my sweet coconut , ” she said .
“ He was a great kisser .
I liked it so much that I bought a book to learn how to kiss myself . ”
Mind that age !

Most likely , its content is outdated .
Especially if it 's technical .
From the django - users mailinglist which I 'm becoming more and more helpful in :
> Could you share approximately how big your project is ?
I know it 's > hard to find a real measure for this , but how about number of database > tables ?
A project I worked on over the summer used a Database that was 130 tables , and getting 1 gb updates every 2 minutes .
I was witting a new web app to do calculations on the data and the company wanted to use Java since thats what they knew best and had spend huge amounts of money ( 1 mil + ) to support with Sun Servers , and such .
But I knew python and django would be a better fit for this particular app , but the boss wouldnt listen .
So we had 10 Developers working on the Java version ( Including me ) and over 3 months we got it about 85 % done , though it had no unit tests .
During the same three months , I worked on my own time after work and basically had no life for the whole time , I was able to get the web app 100 % complete with unit tests .
That convinced my boss that Django was a good fit .
The site is an internal app that I cannot give access to ( And I actually had to get permission to give what info I have ) , but I can say that Django is a suitable framework for what you are looking for .
Christ ! 10 developers and no unit test !?
Someone should remind them that you do n't write unit tests for your bosses pleasure but for your own sanity and productivity .
I know that this quote is totally unscientific since Dj , as he says , ca n't back it up but it's a story interesting enough .

In this post I summarize the climate policy scenarios of the World Energy Outlook 2008 in which coal usage is stabilized and ultimately phased out .
A scenario that would render the question of coal availability useless if it becomes reality .
According to the IEA a combination of energy saving policies , a large expansion of Nuclear and Renewable energy , as well as a large scale implementation of carbon capture and storage at coal and gas power plants are necessary to achieve stabilization of CO2 in the atmosphere between 450 and 550 parts per million , and the ultimate phase out of coal .
The question of coal availability will be analyzed in a follow up post .
The three scenarios
This year the International Energy Agency has published two climate change scenarios in their World Energy Outlook next to the usual reference scenario .
The climate change scenarios are named after the concentration of carbon dioxide emissions in the atmosphere .
In the 550 policy scenario , the IEA has taken a look at the policies necessary to stabilize the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere at 550 parts of CO2 per million parts in the atmosphere by 2030 .
In the 450 policy scenario the goal is thus to stabilize CO2 concentration at 450 parts of CO2 per million in the atmosphere .
Current atmospheric CO2 concentration lies around 385 parts of CO2 per million parts .
The stabilization of CO2 concentration at around 450 parts of CO2 per million implies , according to the IEA , that emissions should only slowly rise to 2020 , after which emissions need to decline at a rapid rate ( shown in figure 2 ) .
Figure 2 - Emissions in the reference , 550 Policy and 450 Policy scenario with their subsequent emissions reduction wedges .
The largest part of this decline in emissions comes from using less coal for electricity production .
In the 550 policy scenario coal consumption is 27 % lower than in the reference scenario in 2030 , and in the 450 policy scenario coal consumption is 51 % lower than in the reference scenario .
The three coal scenarios are as follows :
Reference scenario - Coal demand grows by 2 % on average between 2006 and 2030 .
Leading to an increase in coal consumption by 61 % from 2006 to 2030 .
550 policy scenario - Coal demand grows by 0.7 % on average 2006 and 2030 .
Coal consumption increases by 21 % from 2006 to 2020 and begin to decline thereafter .
The decline is caused by to the introduction of national policies that constrain coal consumption , in particular according to the IEA : energy efficiency , nuclear , renewables and more efficient coal fired power plants .
In 2030 , coal demand is still 17 % higher than today .
450 policy scenario - Coal demand peaks around 2020 and declines thereafter .
In 2030 world coal consumption is similar to the level in 2002 .
The heavier decline after 2020 compared with the 550 policy scenario is the result of introducing carbon prices in other major economies ( China , India ) after 2020 .
Figure 3 - Breakdown of alternatives that need to be implemented according to the IEA to reach 450 and 550 ppm .
The 550 policy scenario in detail
For the 550 policy scenario the main policy changes relative to the reference scenario were assumed to be :
- A cap and trade system which includes the power generation and industry sectors for OECD + ( OECD countries and non-OECD EU countries ) , resulting in a carbon price of $ 90 per tonne of CO2 in 2030 .
This makes renewables , nuclear and carbon capture and storage ( CCS ) more competitive against fossil based electricity generation .
- An intensification of research and development programs to reduce the cost of advanced technologies in OECD +
- Adoption of international sectoral agreements in road transport and aviation .
- An international agreement by aircraft manufacturers to increase the efficiency of new planes by around 20 % by 2020 and around 30 % by 2030 respective to 2006 levels .
- Targeted support mechanisms in OECD + to speed up the deployment of technologies close to market competitiveness
- Development of grids to integrate renewables in OECD +
- Policies that improve the fficiency of fossil - fuel plants in other major economies ( China , India etc . )
- Policies that encourage reducing electricity transmission and distribution losses in other major economies
- Policies that support acceleration of building nuclear power plants in other major economies
- Incentives and regulations boosting the deployment of renewables in other major economies
The effect of this policy change is estimated to be :
- Implementation of carbon capture and storage at 7 coal - fired power plants and 3 gas - fired power plants every year as soon as possible up to 2030
- The construction of 11 new nuclear power plants each year up to 2030 as soon as possible
- The construction of almost 12,000 wind turbines in the period to 2030
- The expansion of hydropower every two years up to 2030 by 64 gigawatt ( equivalent of three dams with the capacity of China 's Three Gorges Dam ) .
- The reduction of coal fired capacity power plant by 762 GW up to 2030
- An increase in gas fired power plant capacity by 107 GW by 2030 .
- A global average efficiency in the light duty vehicle fleet in 2030 of 120 grammes of CO2 per kilometre ( equivalent to approximately 5 liter per 100 kilometre or 47 miles per gallon )
- A global average efficiency in the heavy duty vehicle fleet in 2030 of 560 grammes of CO2 per kilometre , opposed to the current 840 grammes of CO2 per kilometre .
Table 1 - WEO 2008 table showing gross additional power plant capacity added in GW up to 2030 .
Net capacity which includes the
The 450 policy scenario in detail
In the 450 policy scenario the additional CO2 reduction effect comes from an assumed enlargement of the cap - and - trade regime in OECD + to other major economies ( India , China , Brazil etc. ) around 2020 .
The resulting effect is that even more nuclear power plants , hydropower , renewable energy are built between 2020 and 2030 that offset the construction of coal - and gas fired power plants .
In addition it is expected that even more CCS will be implemented .
The difference between the 450 and 550 policy scenario by 2030 are shown in figure 4 and table 2 .
Figure 4 - World electricity generation fuel mix in the 450 policy scenario relative to the 550 policy scenario in 2030 .
Table 2 - Capacity additions in the 450 Policy Scenario relative to the 550 Policy Scenario from 2020 to 2030 .
A few observations to end with
The first questions that arise when I look at the 550 policy scenario table outlining capacity additions from 2007 to 2030 ( table 1 ) involve CCS and the more unknown renewable energy sources .
CCS - The IEA assumes 22 gigawatts of coal fired and 10 gigawatts of gas fired power plants with Carbon Capture and Storage globally by 2020 .
This hinges heavily on the assumption that CCS will be implemented due to the emissions trading scheme of the European Union , or that the US government will put a lot of public money in CCS .
In Europe the European Union has decided that it is up to member states to invest in CCS individually .
To my knowledge the investments for only one small ( 300 - 400 megawatt ) demonstration power plant in Great Britain have been secured so far .
Is the assumption of 32 gigawatts of installed CCS at coal and gas fired power plants by 2020 realistic ?
Renewable energy -
The IEA assumes that by 2030 only 36 gigawatts of solar thermal , 10 gigawatts of geothermal and 7 gigawatts of tidal and wave will have been built .
While this improves somewhat in the 450 policy scenario ( especially for solar thermal ) it makes one wonder on what cost assumptions the very low growth figures of Solar Thermal , Geothermal and Tidal and Wave power by 2030 have been based .
To my expectation these technologies have much more potential than assumed by the IEA .
Die Zoll - und Grenzschutzbehörde der Vereinigten Staaten hat ohne deutliche öffentliche Ankündigung begonnen , Pass - und Ausweisdaten aller auf dem Landweg einreisenden Personen zu registrieren .
Die daraus hervorgehenden Angaben etwa über Name , Geburtsdatum , Geschlecht , Nationalität , Größe oder Wohnort von US - Bürgern sollen 15 Jahre lang zusammen mit Details zum erfolgten Grenzverkehr gespeichert werden .
Für die Daten von Ausländern ist eine Aufbewahrung von 75 Jahren vorgesehen .
Dies berichtet die Washington Post unter Berufung auf einen bislang in der Öffentlichkeit weitgehend unbemerkten , auf Seite 43.457 des Bundesregisters in der Ausgabe vom 25 .
Juli eingebauten Bescheid des federführenden Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) .
Ziel des Informationssystems für Grenzübertritte ist es , die umfassenden Bemühungen der US - Regierung zum Schutz vor terroristischen Bedrohungen zu unterstützen .
Die USA erfassen dafür bereits seit 2004 von allen per Flugzeug und Schiff in den USA landenden Reisenden biometrisch Fingerabdrücke und digitale Fotos im Rahmen des Systems US - VISIT .
Darüber hinaus hat der Grenzschutz ein System zur Speicherung und Auswertung von Flugpassagierdaten aufgebaut .
Ein umstrittenes Abkommen zur Weiterleitung der sensiblen , etwa E - Mail - Adressen oder Essenswünsche umfassenden " Passenger Name Records " gibt es mit der EU .
Seit Anfang des Jahres läuft nun die Ausweitung bestehender Grenzkontrolldatenbanken zur Erfassung auch aller etwa im Auto die Landesgrenzen passierenden Reisenden .
Auf deren Konto gehen Dreiviertel aller Grenzübertritte in die Vereinigten Staaten .
Die hohe Anzahl der über Land Einreisenden hat der Zeitung zufolge bis vor Kurzem die Registrierung persönlicher Daten an den Kontrollpunkten auf analogem Weg verhindert .
Mit stärkerer Verbreitung maschinenlesbarer Ausweisdokumente auch in den USA sei das Informationssammeln aber einfacher geworden .
Von Juni 2009 an müssten US - Bürger entsprechende , kontaktlos über einen RFID - Chip auslesbare Papiere bei der Einreise vorweisen .
Bis dahin würden die Grenzpolizisten die persönlichen Daten von Reisenden ohne maschinenlesbare Dokumente per Hand in das System eintragen , das nach einer kurzen Konsultationsperiode kommenden Montag offiziell starten soll .
Zugriff auf die Datenbank sollen unter anderem US - Sicherheitsbehörden zur Terrorabwehr oder zur Strafverfolgung erhalten .
Die Informationen dürfen aber auch etwa mit Drittstaaten oder Gerichten ausgetauscht werden , falls dies die Einhaltung straf - oder zivilrechtlicher Bestimmungen befördern könnte .
Es ist dem Bericht nach geplant , das System mit weiteren Datenbanken wie solchen über Personen mit Fahrberechtigungen in einzelnen US - Bundesstaaten zu verknüpfen .
Der Vorstoß des DHS sieht weiter vor , dass nicht alle Datenschutzbestimmungen des nur für US - Bürgers geltenden Privacy Act Anwendung finden .
Ausnehmen will die Behörde etwa das Auskunftsrecht über erfolgte Datenabfragen durch Sicherheitsbehörden .
Einen Anspruch auf Einsicht in das System und auf Korrektur von gespeicherten Falschinformationen soll es nicht geben .
US - Bürgerrechtler haben besorgt auf das Vorhaben reagiert .
Eine Datenkontrolle an der Grenze sei zu erwarten , nicht aber eine Speicherung der persönlichen Informationen über viele Jahre hinweg , monierte ein Vertreter des Center for Democracy & Technology ( CDT ) .
Die Datenbank sei in gewissem Sinne schlimmer als bisherige schwarze Listen zur Einreisekontrolle .
Im Gegensatz dazu werde mit dem System jeder Einreisende verdachtsunabhängig kontrolliert .
Ferner sei zweifelhaft , ob es eine gesetzliche Grundlage für das Überwachungsprojekt gebe .
Generell könnten mit Datamining - Techniken auch Unschuldige in die Fänge des Systems geraten .
Ein DHS - Sprecher verteidigte dagegen den Ansatz und die lange Speicherdauer .
Die Erfahrung lehre , dass die Planung von Verbrechen oder Terroranschlägen zeitweise über Jahre hinweg laufe .
Die Reisedaten könnten den Ermittlern hier helfen , Verbindungen zu knüpfen .
Die Anlage des " Border Crossing Information " - Systems sei zudem durch bestehende Anti-Terrorgesetze gedeckt .

The test that predicts when the menopause will start
Roadmap : A new test tells women how many years they are away from their menopause so they can better plan pregnancies in later life
Scientists have developed a test that can predict when a woman will go through the menopause .
The breakthrough will allow those in their late 30s and 40s to pinpoint how long they have left to conceive and when they should try for a baby .
It will also help women prepare mentally for fertility loss and the hot flushes , mood swings and loss of libido that the ' change ' brings on .
The test , which measures hormones in the blood to calculate how many eggs are left in ovaries , was welcomed last night by British experts .
Bill Ledger , professor of obstetrics and gynaecology at Sheffield University , said : ' The menopause is a big life event which has big implications for women 's lifestyle and quality of life .
' This test seems to be reasonably predictive of menopause .
' Lots of people want to know when it 's going to happen so that they can plan their life , work and children , if possible .
This would give them an idea of that .'
The test was developed by a team at the University of Michigan in the US .
It found that changes in the levels of three hormones - AMH , FSH and inhibin B - in more than 600 women studied , could be used to predict when a woman would enter the menopause .
For example , the level of AMH almost disappears five years before a woman has her final period .
By then , there are likely to be so few eggs that the woman is unlikely to be very fertile .
Clinicians have previously measured these hormones but were not able to relate changing levels to fertility or to a menopause end point because of a lack of data .
Team leader Professor MaryFran Sowers said : ' The information provides a road map as to how fast women are progressing through the different elements of their reproductive life . '
' People really want information about how long do I have and when will I have my final menstrual period .
' Now we are beginning to say , ' If you have a specific FSH level combined with your age , this is the likelihood that you are in this reproductive stage . '
' We finally have numbers from enough women evaluated over a long time period to describe the reproductive ageing process . '

Two anonymous donors have offered to match dollar for dollar every donation that comes in to the No on Prop 8 campaign , to protect marriage rights for everyone in California up to $ 500,000 .
Below are 8 things that should motivate you to help us meet the match .
You can contribute directly to the campaign via ActBlue here .
8. John McCain can look Ellen Degeneres straight in the face and reject her right to marriage .
7. Luckily , the big donors behind Prop 8 do n't think stoning gays is a " necessity . "
In 2004 , Howard F. Ahmanson -- who gave $ 900 K to the Yes campaign -- told the Orange County Register : " I think what upsets people is that Rushdoony seemed to think –- and I 'm not sure about this –- that a godly society would stone people for the same thing that people in ancient Israel were stoned .
I no longer consider that essential .
It would still be a little hard to say that if one stumbled on a country that was doing that , that it is inherently immoral , to stone people for these things .
But I do n't think it 's at all a necessity . "
6 . " Yes on 8 " supporters are emptying out their savings accounts to defeat " teh gays "
" Pam and Rick Patterson have always followed teachings of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints and tried to live within their means .
He drives a 10 - year - old Honda Civic to his job at Intel .
She is a stay - at home mom who makes most of the family meals and bakes her own bread .
The couple , who have five sons between the ages of 3 and 12 , live in a comfortable but modest three - bedroom home in Folsom .
It 's a traditional lifestyle they believe is now at risk .
That 's why the Pattersons recently made a huge financial sacrifice – they withdrew $ 50,000 from their savings and donated it to the Yes on Proposition 8 campaign , the ballot measure that seeks to ban same - sex marriage . "
5 . They are gracious enough to remind us that it 's not about intolerance .
" Proposition 8 is NOT an attack on gay couples " --www.Protectmarriage.com
" In August [ 2008 ] , the prophets added pages of elaboration : ' The Church has a single , undeviating standard of sexual morality : intimate relations are proper only between a husband and a wife united in bonds of matrimony . ' "
4 . They value America 's workers .
" The ( one million ) YES on Prop 8 yard signs have been delayed in route from China . "
3 . Mormons love gays so much , they have pressured their 770,000 members to donate millions of dollars to pass Prop 8 and eliminate marriage rights :
If you 're not listed on the massive searchable donor spreadsheets publicly available on this site , you must not be a good Mormon .
2 . Their spokespeople want to extend the " equality " to elderly and sterile couples !
And , the # 1 reason why you should donate to defeat Prop 8 :
1. Religious wingnuts are packing Qualcomm Stadium in San Diego on November 1 .
And they are mobilizing millions across America at " TheCall.com " ( MUST - WATCH VIDEO AT THE TOP ) .

To install any ruby gem which has a command - line interface on Ubuntu 8.10 , you have to add a path to your PATH environment variable .
In your . bashrc file , add the following line :
export PATH=$PATH:/var/lib/gems/1.8/bin
Also worth noting is the fact that the default ruby interpreter on 8.10 is back to the 1.8 branch : it ’s 1.8.7 ( 1.9 was the default on 8.04 iirc ) .
1.9 also be installed right besides 1.8 .
$ ruby --version ruby 1.8.7 ( 2008-08 - 11 patchlevel 72 ) [ i486- linux ] $ ruby1.9 --version ruby 1.9.0 ( 2008-06 - 20 revision 17482 ) [ i486- linux ]
Neither comes installed by default , however .
You must install them explicitly .
sudo aptitude install ruby irb rubygems
While I ’m at it , why not mention that rubygems 1.2.0 is installed by default .
It does n’t want to update to 1.3.0 with the usual “ gem update – system ” command .
Since it ’s not my main machine I did n’t investigate further , but the suggestion is to use apt - get or aptitude .
The repos do n’t seem to be up to date with 1.3.0 , but rather with a version named something like 1.3.0really 1.2.0 .
OCTOBER 20 -- An 88 - year - old Ohio grandmother was arrested last week when she refused to return a neighborhood boy 's football that had landed in her front yard .
A frustrated Edna Jester took the football last Thursday evening after it landed , once again , in the yard of her Blue Ash home , where she has lived since April 1949 .
When Jester refused to return the football , neighbor Paul Tanis , 40 , called the cops .
Though police warned that she would be arrested unless she returned the football , Jester refused , according to a Blue Ash Police Department report .
In a TSG interview , an emotional Jester said that she had repeatedly warned her teenage neighbors that she did not want to retrieve their football since , ' I 'm not a ball chaser . '
Jester , pictured at left , added that she frequently told the young football enthusiasts that she did not want them on her property and did not want to be bothered while she was reading the Bible or eating dinner .
Jester , who lives alone , still has the football .
The petty theft bust was the first arrest for Jester , who has been widowed for about ten years .
One of Jester 's three children has predeceased her , while a second , a 70 - year - old daughter , is living in a nursing home .
She is scheduled to appear November 12 in Mayor 's Court on the theft rap .

Proprietary data formats may be legally defensible but open standards can be a better spur for innovation .
A historian of science and computing , and a scholar whose PhD thesis was on “ professionalization of cooking among domestic servants in eighteenth - century France ” , might seem unlikely characters to find at the centre of a multimillion - dollar lawsuit .
But that is exactly what has happened in the suit brought against George Mason University ( GMU ) in Fairfax , Virginia , by Thomson Reuters , the company probably best known for its ISI science indicators .
Dan Cohen , director of GMU's Center for History and New Media , and Sean Takats , a GMU history professor , are also directors of Zotero : open - source software developed by the history centre that lets researchers organize and share their digital information iTunes style , whether it is in the form of citations , documents or web pages .
Zotero is free and popular , and has attracted some 1 million downloads since its launch in October 2006 .
Thomson makes the proprietary bibliography software EndNote , and claims that Zotero is causing its commercial business “ irreparable harm ” and is wilfully and intentionally destroying Thomson 's customer base .
In particular , Thomson is demanding that GMU stop distributing the newer beta-version of Zotero that allegedly allows EndNote 's proprietary data format for storing journal citation styles to be converted into an open - standard format readable by Zotero and other software .
Thomson claims that Zotero “ reverse engineered or decompiled ” not only the format , but also the EndNote software itself .
The company is seeking a minimum of US $ 10 million in damages annually until GMU halts distribution of Zotero 's new feature .
It also demands that GMU “ terminate ” the ability of each Zotero user to use or distribute any open - source files converted from EndNote 's own data format .
GMU seems ready to fight the suit ; a spokesperson told Nature that the university believes it is “ well within its rights ” , but declined to go into further detail given the ongoing litigation .
Thomson was contacted but declined to comment , saying : “ It is the policy of Thomson Reuters that we do not comment on pending litigation . ”
Thomson is claiming on the grounds that GMU has a site licence to EndNote , and that Zotero 's actions breach the terms of the licensing contract .
Thomson did not challenge GMU on grounds of copyright law , in which certain protections are in place to allow for creating interoperability .
Thomson also claims that Zotero is infringing on the trademark ' EndNote ' to induce Zotero users to convert EndNote 's proprietary style files .
Litigation , which may go to a jury trial , is pending , so judging this case on its legal merits would be premature .
But on a more general level , the virtues of interoperability and easy data - sharing among researchers are worth restating .
Imagine if Microsoft Word or Excel files could be opened and saved only in these proprietary formats , for example .
It would be impossible for OpenOffice and other such software to read and save these files using open standards — as they can legally do .
Competition between open - source and proprietary software is long - running , as personified by the struggle between Windows and Linux for desktop and server operating systems , but also in many branches of software used by scientists .
Researchers tend to lean towards open sharing , but they will also pay for added - value features , and it 's important that the playing field is level .
Ultimately , the customer is king .

If you do n’t know Danny Elfman , you know his music .
Better known for his unique film scores and “ The Simpsons ” theme than his political views , the composer is running an ad in battleground states with a simple message : “ President Sarah Palin — think about it . ”

Danny Elfman / OurGreatestFear.org :
We are in the last days of what is likely to be the most important election of our lives .
This is especially true given the current crises at home and abroad and the fact that at least one , and likely two Supreme Court Justices are likely to be up for retirement in this next term .
( Justice Stevens , one of the last liberal jurors on the court is 88 this year )
The potential implications of that alone are staggering .
For more on that check out this New Yorker article .
I appreciate that the Democrats are n’t stooping to the level that the McCain campaign and its friends have ( even Karl Rove has said that the GOP has gone too far this year ! ) .
But I was n’t seeing responses from the Democrats that were nailing some simple messages that I felt were important .
That ’s why I decided to take action .
It did n’t take long to realize that I knew many others that I knew who were as frustrated and committed as I was and I thought why ca n’t we just do it ourselves instead of just complaining ?

ECONOMY : The growth that simply vanished - and now Labour will drive national debt to more than £ 1trillion
The national debt will surge to record highs of 57 per cent of national income by 2012 - 13
Alistair Darling was forced to announce the biggest downgrades to Treasury growth estimates on record .
The Chancellor admitted in his speech
that forecasts given in his March budget
were hopelessly optimistic given the scale of Britain ’s economic collapse .
While the Treasury was hoping to see
growth of up to 2.75 per cent next year , it
now admits the economy could contract
by up to 1.25 per cent .
The admission represents an historic U - turn by the Treasury .
Observers were equally stunned by the
scale of the recovery Mr Darling expects
after 2009 .
He predicted economic expansion in
2010 will be more than twice the pace
expected this year .
And by 2011 the economy could be
growing at 3.25 per cent – its fastest clip
in 11 years .
The Chancellor said : ‘ Because of the
wide ranging measures I am announcing today and the many strengths of the British economy , I am confident that the slowdown will be shallower and shorter than would have been the case .
‘ I am also confident that the UK , as an adaptable and open economy , will be well
positioned to benefit from a return to growth in the world economy . ’
The growth spurt will supposedly be driven by Labour ’s £ 20 billion of short term
tax cuts .
In addition , the Treasury is hoping that banks will start lending again as it takes
additional steps to alleviate the credit drought .
And Mr Darling claims the world economy is set to rebound sharply in the early part of the next decade .
Analysts , however , said these predictions may well prove far - fetched .
That is partly because the Treasury is introducing a welter of tax hikes which will take over £ 12 billion out of the pockets of firms and families between 2010 and 2012 alone .
This will act as a hindrance to growth .
Mr Darling ’s heady recovery assumptions also presume that bank lending will return to ‘ business as usual ’ levels quickly .
And they rely on a huge boost to exports thanks to strong demand overseas .
Yet abroad , the economic news is getting steadily worse , not better .
In America , where the economy has been struggling for at least a year longer than ours , house prices fell by the most ever in October , figures showed on Monday .
And in Germany , our second - biggest export market after the U.S. , business confidence slumped to its lowest in 16 years last month .
At the time of the Budget Mr Darling was criticised for being too optimistic .
Chancellor
On Monday the fear in the City was that even the new growth predictions in the Pre-Budget Report will prove too rosy .
Economist James Knightley of ING bank said : ‘ We have serious doubts ( about Darling ’s forecasts ) given that the recession is likely to be nastier than is assumed in these forecasts .
‘ We see the economy performing far more poorly in 2009 and 2010 , with the economy contracting 1.7 per cent in 2009 and then recording only one per centgrowth in 2010 at best . ’
£ 1TRN IN DEBT WITHIN FIVE YEARS
Labour will drive national debt to more than £ 1trillion within five years as a result of Mr Darling ’s Pre-Budget measures .
That is more than £ 40,000 for every household in the country .
Next year alone the Chancellor will borrow an extraordinary £ 4,720 for every household as he throws out Gordon Brown ’s so - called self - imposed ‘ golden rules ’ .
That is 8 per cent of national income , the highest level since modern records began in 1970 .
As recently as March the deficit was expected to be a mere 2.6 per cent .
Mr Darling ’s forecasts show that net borrowing will grow by an extraordinary £ 512 billion between this year and 2014 .
By 2013 - 14 , the national debt will have ballooned to £ 1.1 trillion .
Britain has never seen such extraordinary figures .
By 2012 - 13 it will represent a record 57 per cent of national income .
By pushing public debt above 50 per cent Mr Darling will take the Government ’s liabilities to levels seen in major continental European economies .
This breaches the fiscal rule introduced by Gordon Brown requiring public debt to be kept below 40 per cent of national income .
Migrants lost at sea for 15 days resort to cannibalism by eating dead passengers to survive
A group of refugees who were cast adrift at sea for more than two weeks survived by eating dead passengers , it has emerged .
The 33 Dominican migrants were trying to reach Puerto Rico by boat but were cast adrift after their captain became lost .
Only four survived the ordeal and admitted they are only alive after eating fellow migrants .
The crew were told by their captain not to bring any food or water aboard when they set off from Sanchez on the one - day journey to the U.S territory on October 17 .
Dominican Gregorio Marizan and three other men survived 15 days at sea by eating their dead shipmates
But the captain abandoned ship after two days , admitting they were lost while the boat ran out of fuel , casting the group adrift .
The only woman in the group and one of five people to be rescued , died in hospital after they were found near the Turks and Caicos Islands .
Speaking from his hospital bed , survivor Gregorio Maria Marizan said the group tried to sustain themselves on rain and seawater .
Saulio Marizan recovers in hospital but his brother Emmanuel died during the ordeal
Famished and dehydrated , they watched migrant after migrant die , each time waiting 15 to 20 minutes before throwing the body overboard .
The survivor said the decision to eat the dead shipmates was not an easy one to take and did so in order to live .
' Imagine , 15 days without food , without water .
I 'm a sailor , a fisherman - they were all yelling at me to do something , ' he said .
' I always try to be prepared , so I had brought my knife along .
We had n't brought food because it was supposed to be a quick trip .
' We had nothing to eat .
We had to eat him , to save our own lives .
We cut from his leg and chest .
We cut little pieces and swallowed them like pills .
' It 's like beef , almost the same .
At the skin there is like half an inch of yellow fat , then the fibres . '
The divorced father - of - three said he and his brothers Saulio , 27 , and Emmanuel , 30 , were forced to attempt the treacherous crossing in search of a better life .
The elder brother Emmanuel did n't survive the journey .
Hundreds of Dominicans take to the sea each year in small boats , many of them homemade , trying to reach Puerto Rico through the dangerous Mona Passage .
Thanking God for being alive , Marizan said he wanted one of the family to stay alive to tell the story .
Dominican Minister of Tourism Francisco Javier Garcia said the migrants ate from the corpse of the last person to die .
Franklin Paoulino and the group were forced to eat their dead shipmates in order to survive
Mr Garcia said the bodies of the other dead were thrown into the sea and the five were rescued by U.S. Coast Guard helicopter on Saturday and taken to a hospital on the island of Providenciales .
' The surviving four are dehydrated and have swollen legs but are expected to recover , ' he said after visiting the survivor .
In 2004 , 36 survivors in a group of 87 migrants drank breast milk , sea water and ate human flesh in desperate acts to survive .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
As Republican leaders sift through the ruins of the 2008 election and debate the party 's future at the Republican Governors Association meeting this week , one of the GOP 's potential standard - bearers is instead on a Caribbean cruise .
But it is n't just any cruise and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney is n't just any Republican .
Since the economy began its historic downturn six weeks ago , Romney 's stock in his party appears to have skyrocketed .
The former business consultant and founder of Bain Capital handled economic issues during his campaign with an ease and confidence that seemed to elude Sen. John McCain .
As the stock market tanked throughout the fall , a growing chorus of conservative pundits speculated Romney would have boosted the GOP ticket considerably more than Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin did .
Now the onetime front - runner for the Republican nomination is schmoozing influential party insiders on the National Review 's annual cruise -- a gathering of 700 conservative activists and the same forum where Palin wowed the movement 's media elite last year , beginning her meteoric rise from obscure governor to vice presidential nominee .
But even as Romney publicly declares he has no intentions to run again , several former aides said they believe he will , and this week 's get - together with leading conservatives is only the latest sign the man who spent more than $ 50 million of his own money to vie for the party 's nomination last year is itching to do it again .
Watch more on the GOP 's rising stars »
After all , in many ways Romney 's campaign for 2012 appeared to begin the instant he abandoned his primary bid in February .
Instead of the conventional location befitting most losing candidates -- his home state , surrounded by friends and family -- Romney broke the news to grass - roots activists at a gathering in Washington .
The last - minute announcement was greeted with cries of surprise and was seen as a public attempt to bolster his standing with the key GOP voting bloc that largely broke former Arkansas Gov.
Mike Huckabee 's way through the first round of primary contests .
" There he was addressing the largest gathering every year of conservatives , and it was extremely symbolic in many ways , " said Matt Lewis , a writer for the conservative Web site Townhall.com .
" That 's where he chose to say for the good of the movement he was going to get out .
It was very well - received by most people , and he is now in a better position to garner more conservative support because of it . "
After bowing out , Romney maintained a constant presence on the campaign trail and cable news circuit on McCain 's behalf , signaling to political observers that he still harbored presidential ambitions , even after he was passed up for the No. 2 spot on the party 's ticket .
Romney also has maintained close relationships with key supporters in the early voting states of Iowa and New Hampshire , according to party officials there , and could easily revive the infrastructure he built should he launch another bid .
If the economy continues to flail after four years of Democratic rule , Romney 's economic acumen may be in demand when it comes to restoring GOP power to the White House .
" If the economy remains the dominant issue , there will certainly be a draft Romney movement , you can count on it , " Lewis said .
Romney also may be positioned to attract a wider base of support than some of the other figures on the Republican bench , including the now - GOP rock star Palin and Huckabee , whose 2008 campaign outlasted Romney's .
Both have shown the ability to generate excitement among base voters but appear to remain fairly unappealing to the more moderate faction of the party -- not to mention independent voters who are permitted to vote in some Republican primaries .
Al Regnery , publisher of The American Spectator who attended a summit of prominent conservatives in Virginia last week , said movement leaders continue to toss around Romney 's name as they look to the future .
" People are going to have to compete for what will be the equivalent of several interviews with conservatives as to whether they fit the job description , and Romney would certainly be one of these contenders , " Regnery said .
But even as the Romney drumbeat already can be heard in some corners of the party , it remains possible the former governor will face the same problems that hindered his 2008 campaign -- namely the perception he is overambitious and given to flip - flopping on issues for political expediency .
" Many conservatives never really trusted him , " Regnery said .
" A lot of people think he pretty much adjusted his message to meet the needs [ of the base ] .
He 's going to have to go back around and talk to the dinners and talk to the small groups and large groups and write op - eds with a fairly consistent message . "
Stephen Wayne , a professor of American government at Georgetown University , also noted that not holding elected office now makes it more difficult for Romney to stay relevant on the political scene .
" He 's going to need some vehicle to stay in the public eye and comment on the economy and , if appropriate , be critical of the new Obama administration , " Wayne said .
" One of the problems that people who are not in elected office have is that they do n't have a ready platform until you start running for office . "
But should Romney decide on a second presidential run , he 's likely to face a friendlier reception than his first go - around .
The base may to be more convinced of Romney 's conservative commitment if he 's willing to take another stab at the presidency , activists say , and the Republican Party has a history of rewarding presidential candidates who have run at least once and lost .
" There is a tradition in the Republican Party -- you run first for the nomination and lose , and then you run and get it , " Wayne said , pointing to Presidents Reagan and George H.W. Bush , former Sen. Bob Dole and McCain .
" Losing once is almost a badge of honor among Republicans . "

The latest CBS News poll of undecided voters finds that by a 53 % - 22 % margin , they thought Obama won the debate .
Twenty four percent thought that the debate was a draw .
The CNN poll of voters watching the debate thought Obama won the debate 58% - 31 % .
This means that according to the polls , Barack Obama swept the debates .
Obama dominated the health care issue in the CBS poll , as 69 % of voters thought Obama would make the right decisions on health care .
Only 30 % felt the same way about John McCain .
Obama out polled McCain 63 % - 56 % when asked which candidate shared their values .
The big problem for McCain is that even when his numbers increased in the CBS poll , so did Obama’s .
In the eyes of voters , McCain ca n’t seem to catch Obama .
The most telling results so far have come from the CNN poll .
I think that McCain has three problems .
First , he does n’t seem to share the views of voters .
Second .
He has not looked like a strong leader in any of these debates , and third , McCain is n’t likable .
On the issue of which candidate shared their views , Obama won 66 % - 25 % .
Obama was viewed as the stronger leader by a margin of 56% - 39 % .
On the question of who was more likable , Obama won 70 % - 22 % .

Obama was viewed as the better candidate to handle the economy , 55 % - 39 % .
Critically , Obama won with Independents by a margin of 57% - 31 % .
The bad news for McCain is that these numbers look just like the numbers after the first two debates .
What that says to me is that it does n’t matter what McCain does in these debates , the voters do n’t like his style and tone , and they do n’t trust him on the economy .
McCain has been unsuccessful in his quest to raise question about Obama .
In fact , his character attacks have backfired , and made Obama ’s responses look even more presidential .
My best guess is that the dye has been cast , and voters have made their minds up about McCain .
The lack of movement in these polls from debate to debate tells me that the electorate is not fluid , that this race has settled into Obama being in control .
I think that McCain ca n’t win this race , but Obama can still do something to lose it , if he is n’t careful .

How much will it take to get the economy back on its feet ?
President - elect Obama ’s team has begun working on a plan to spend up to $ 500 billion in new funds if the economy continues to worsen .
President - elect Obama promised to create 5 million new green jobs in the alternative energy sector .
However with the economic outlook worsening daily , will he be able to put his money where his mouth is ?
“ The situation in the economy is the biggest impediment to any strategy , ” said Christine Tezac , an energy and policy analyst at the Stanford Group Co. in Washington , D.C .
There is speculation that some of Obama ’s ‘ green plans ’ might need to give way to more pressing economic issues like rescuing the housing market and creating jobs in other ( not necessarily green ) sectors .
That could cost not just green job creation but also funding for the green economy .
Obama might have a tough time passing the much - anticipated climate change bill , whose higher costs for utilities would ultimately mean heftier electricity bills for consumers .
Failure to pass a bill that would create a system to sell carbon credits would also dry up one key source of funding for Obama ’s $ 150 billion in promised alternative - energy investments .
And what about his proposed climate legislation that would reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 80 % over the next four decades ?
Implementing a cap - and - trade program that would assign a cost to carbon dioxide emissions potentially provide funds for alternative energy initiatives .
What do you think ?
Do we have a case of economy vs. green or will we see the green economy that Obama has promised ?
WASHINGTON , Oct. 17 ( UPI ) -- Most U.S. states are not prepared to handle Election Day voting glitches such as machine breakdowns , experts say .
A report by voter advocacy groups Common Cause , Verified Voting and the Brennan Center for Justice says states also lack the ability to respond to a shortage of emergency ballots , Stateline.org reported Friday .

The report says among the states least - prepared to handle problems are the presidential swing states of Colorado and Virginia , along with Delaware , Kentucky , Louisiana , New Jersey , South Carolina , Tennessee , Texas and Utah .
The voter advocacy groups found that Alaska , California , Michigan , North Carolina , Oregon and Wisconsin have the best - prepared voting systems .
" We know that on Nov. 4 , voting systems will fail somewhere .
They 've failed somewhere in every national election since 2000 , " said Larry Norden of the Brennan Center .
" Unfortunately , we can't predict where those failures will be , and for this reason , every state has to be as prepared as possible for a system failure . "
Stateline reported a separate report also released Thursday found that most states lack a Web site that has easily accessible Election Day information , such as polling locations .
The report by the Make Voting Work , a non-partisan project of the Pew Center on the States , and Nielsen Norman Group gave the lowest grades to New Hampshire , Mississippi , Illinois , Connecticut and New Mexico .
Iowa , meanwhile , got the highest marks , Stateline reported .

He says he 's become a freelance distributor for a health supplement company .
Turns out that there are tons of people out there who will pay big bucks for his products .
And even better , the more salesmen he hires to work for him , the more money he makes .
For a one - time sign - up fee , plus the cost of the merchandise , you could start doing the same thing tomorrow .
" Hire 10 salesmen , " he says , " And you 'll have your own BMW in a month . "
Wow , you think , this is the real deal .
No more office work , no more bosses , just managing a team of salesmen from home .
You go for it .
You hand your neighbor a check , collect your starter kit of supplements and start hitting the phones looking for potential salesmen .
You call your buddy Bob to see if he 's interested .
But the weird thing is , Bob ran into your same neighbor yesterday at the grocery store and also signed up to be a distributor .
What 's worse , Bob 's already been calling around , and it looks like your neighbor and his buddies have already signed up half the city .
" Nobody 's going to want to buy from us because we 're all trying to sell ! " cries Bob .
" And we 'll never make our money back on salespeople because there 's no one left to recruit ! "
Looks like you 've been suckered in by a pyramid scheme .
Your neighbor and his buddies are at the top of the pyramid .
They got in early and made money by recruiting people like you .
But now you 're competing with hundreds of other distributors for the same small pool of potential recruits .
The odds of making your money back are worse than roulette in Vegas [ source : Taylor ] .
So who makes money and who loses it in a pyramid scheme ?
And what are some signs that a fabulous " business opportunity " is really a pyramid in disguise ?

New Assignments
Note to Barack Obama : there are ways to deal with all those unqualified appointees that Bush has smuggled into the civil service :
“ A MAVERICK Thai general who has threatened to bomb anti-government protesters and drop snakes on them from helicopters has been reassigned as an aerobics teacher , the Bangkok Post said on Friday .
Major - general Khattiya Sawasdipol , a Rambo - esque anti-communist fighter more commonly known as Seh Daeng , reacted with disappointment to his new role as a military instructor promoting public fitness at marketplaces .
‘ It is ridiculous to send me , a warrior , to dance at markets , ’ he said , before launching an attack on his boss , army chief Anupong Paochinda .
‘ The army chief wants me to be a presenter leading aerobics dancers .
I have prepared one dance .
It ’s called the ‘ throwing - a - hand - grenade ’ dance ’ , he said . ” ( h/t )
Another story from printer - land of 20 years ago : this time about a seemingly impossible bug .
While working on the LPS - 20 PostScript software , a bug was filed that said roughly ,
Print the attached file .
The LPS - 20 will jam .
You ’ll have to open the printer to remove the scrunched up paper .
We were no strangers to jammed printers , but a particular file that could jam the printer ?
Yeah , right .
It was crazy .
I printed the file .
The printer jammed !
I cleared the jam , printed the file again , it jammed again .
I printed a different file , it printed fine .
I printed a third file , it printed fine .
Printed the bug report file again , the printer jammed , WTF !?
How can a file reliably cause a printer to jam ?
The mystery in this case was solved by the hardware team , because while we software guys were working on the software that fed PostScript files to the printer , the hardware guys were still getting the kinks out of the printer itself .
A laser printer has a drum on which the image is formed , and then used to transfer the image to the paper .
In a 20 ppm printer like the LPS - 20 , the drum rotates once every three seconds .
With a PostScript printer , a page could take an arbitrary amount of time to render .
If the page takes less than three seconds to render , then the drum will rotate at full speed , with no pauses .
But if the PostScript interpreter takes longer than three seconds to finish a page , then the drum has to stop and wait for the image to be ready .
Starting and stopping the drum and all the associated feed machinery is not trivial to get right .
In the case of the bug report file , the page took longer than three seconds , but only slightly longer , so not only did the drum have to stop , but it had n’t quite totally stopped before it was started again .
That mechanical edge case is what made the printer jam .
The file had pages that took just the right amount of time to hit a bad timing window in the drive train firmware , and the printer jammed every time .
Once the hardware guys adjusted the firmware , the problem went away .
Lessons :
America is finished !
This revelation came to me while watching the second debate between Senators Obama and McCain in Nashville .
I have never before felt the sense of hopelessness as I feel now , after listening to these two pretenders to the Office of President .
It is obvious that this debate was nothing more than a charade in which both of these so - called candidates refused to address the real reasons which is driving our
America is falling apart and the election of a new President beholden to special interests and corporate cash is not going to save the country , but only hasten its demise .

The U.S. became famous for this pattern of decay and new growth .
Over time , American government built a bigger safety net so workers could survive the vicissitudes of this creative destruction  with unemployment insurance and soon , one hopes , health care security .
But the government has generally not interfered in the dynamic process itself , which is the source of the country ’s prosperity .
But this , apparently , is about to change .
Democrats from Barack Obama to Nancy Pelosi want to grant immortality to General Motors , Chrysler and Ford .
They have decided to follow an earlier $ 25 billion loan with a $ 50 billion bailout , which would inevitably be followed by more billions later , because if these companies are not permitted to go bankrupt now , they never will be .
This is a different sort of endeavor than the $ 750 billion bailout of Wall Street .
That money was used to save the financial system itself .
It was used to save the capital markets on which the process of creative destruction depends .
Granting immortality to Detroit ’s Big
Three does not enhance creative destruction .
It retards it .
It crosses a line , a bright line .
It is not about saving a system ; there will still be cars made and sold in America .
It is about saving politically powerful corporations .
A Detroit bailout would set a precedent for every single politically connected corporation in America .
There already is a long line of lobbyists bidding for federal money .
If Detroit gets money , then everyone would have a case .
After all , are the employees of Circuit City or the newspaper industry inferior to the employees of Chrysler ?
Well , it ’s still there .
If it were n’t there , these books would go unread .
But Mr. O’Reilly , who either works with a collaborator or was born with a ghostwriter ’s gift for filling space with platitudes ( “ as Bob Dylan sang , the times were a - changin ’ ” ) , can make himself sound tough and blunt on the page , and can even turn his bullying into backhanded humor .
“ Of course , many people do not see the wrongs that I see because they do n’t see the world the way that I do , ” he says .
“ All of us should feel very sorry for them . ”
Of a childhood diet filled with junk food , he says , “ if it ’s true that ‘ you are what you eat , ’ then I am one sweet guy , simply because of cereal intake alone . ”
One sweet guy : for even his fondest readers , these are not the first three words Mr. O’Reilly ( a man who counts “ pinheads ” as a favorite word ) brings to mind .
But he presents himself plausibly as the strong - willed product of a strict Roman Catholic education .
( “ A bold fresh piece of humanity ” was one nun ’s way of calling him a wiseguy .
He cherishes that nickname enough to use it several hundred times here . )
He grew up with starkly black - and - white ideas of good and evil .
And he has been seeing the world that way ever since .
“ Summing up , all child abuse is evil , and most abusers are bad people , ” he writes in a chapter that also daringly takes on rap lyrics , horror films and terrorists .
“ We do n’t have to get more complicated than that . ”
So we do n’t .
But we do n’t get all that controversial , either .

At the sincere heart of Mr. O’Reilly ’s memories is his father , whose example the son has apparently spent his life repudiating .
The senior Mr. O’Reilly is recalled with affection but also with constant criticism : he was too weak and cautious for his son ’s taste .
Describing his father as a man so cowed by the Great Depression that he spent his life working for “ a corporate giant that could not have cared less about him , ” young Billy , born in 1949 , determined to put himself on a different course .
So this book fondly summons the stickball , name - calling and proudly thuggish atmosphere that taught him how to fight .
Who said George W. Bush is not a friend to the hip hop community ?
The president has gone and pardoned John Forte , a rapper ( who got briefly famous doing tracks with the Fugees ) who 's been in prison since 2000 for a cocaine smuggling conviction .
$ 1.4 million in liquid coke through the Newark airport , to be precise .
I forgive Bush for the wars and everything now !
Forte has always maintained his innocence , but so does everyone else in jail , and you do n't see Republican Christian fundamentalist zealot politicians pardoning them .
So why did W. set Forte free ?
It 's those private school connections paying off :
[ Carly ] Simon and Ben Taylor , her son by singer James Taylor , had lobbied the feds to commute Forte 's sentence , arguing he was a first - time offender .
Ben Taylor and Forte had become friends at the Phillips Exeter Academy in New Hampshire .
Taylor often took him to visit his family , and Forte once worked as a backup singer for Simon .
There you have it : rappers will be considered for pardons as long as they made friends with the children of celebrities while attending pricey private schools .
Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch also lobbied Bush to let him go !
That is simply too awesome to be critical about .
Welcome home , John .

Newt Gingrich 's sister really lowered the boom on his anti-gay rhetoric after his many appearances on FOX news in a letter she posted on the Huffington Post .
He 's been really brutal over the Prop 8 vote when he recently just stated on The Factor ( see video ) that :
" there is a gay and secular fascism in this country that wants to impose its will on the rest of us , is prepared to use violence , to use harassment .
I think it is prepared to use the government if it can get control of it .
I think that it is a very dangerous threat to anybody who believes in traditional religion . "
Are n't those just lovely words to hear being uttered by your own brother ?
Candice writes to him and says :
A Letter to My Brother Newt Gingrich Welcome to the 21st century , big bro .
I can understand why you 're so afraid of the energy that has been unleashed after gay and lesbian couples had their rights stripped away from them by a hateful campaign .
I can see why you 're sounding the alarm against the activists who use all the latest tech tools to build these rallies from the ground up in cities across the country .
This is a movement of the people that you most fear .
It 's a movement of progress -- and your words on FOX News only show how truly desperate you are to maintain control of a world that is changing before your very eyes .
Very powerful stuff ....
Dear Newt , I recently had the displeasure of watching you bash the protesters of the Prop 8 marriage ban to Bill O'Reilly on FOX News .
I must say , after years of watching you build your career by stirring up the fears and prejudices of the far right , I feel compelled to use the words of your idol , Ronald Reagan , " There you go , again . "
However , I realize that you may have been a little preoccupied lately with planning your resurrection as the savior of your party , so I thought I would fill you in on a few important developments you might have overlooked .
The truth is that you 're living in a world that no longer exists .
I , along with millions of Americans , clearly see the world the way it as -- and we embrace what it can be .
You , on the other hand , seem incapable of looking for new ideas or moving beyond what worked in the past .
Welcome to the 21st century , big bro .
I can understand why you 're so afraid of the energy that has been unleashed after gay and lesbian couples had their rights stripped away from them by a hateful campaign .
I can see why you 're sounding the alarm against the activists who use all the latest tech tools to build these rallies from the ground up in cities across the country .
This is a movement of the people that you most fear .
It 's a movement of progress -- and your words on FOX News only show how truly desperate you are to maintain control of a world that is changing before your very eyes .
Then again , we 've seen these tactics before .
We know how much the right likes to play political and cultural hardball , and then turn around and accuse us of lashing out first .
You give a pass to a religious group -- one that looks down upon minorities and women -- when they use their money and membership roles to roll back the rights of others , and then you label us " fascists " when we fight back .
You belittle the relationships of gay and lesbian couples , and yet somehow neglect to explain who anointed you the protector of " traditional " marriage .
And , of course , you 've also mastered taking the foolish actions of a few people and then indicting an entire population based on those mistakes .
I fail to see how any of these patterns coincide with the values of " historic Christianity " you claim to champion .
read on Again , nothing new here .
This is just more of the blatant hypocrisy we 're used to hearing .
Thanks Candice for telling it like it is .
It must be very difficult for you to have a brother who has the influence he does in the Conservative movement that actively speaks out against the way you choose to live your life .

Environment correspondent , BBC News website , Barcelona
The seas are one of the ecosystems threatened by human activities
At least 25 % of the world 's mammal species are at risk of extinction , according to the first assessment of their status for a decade .
The Red List of Threatened Species says populations of more than half of mammalian species are falling , with Asian primates particularly at risk .
The biggest threat to mammals is loss of habitat , including deforestation .
But there is good news for the African elephant , whose recovery leads to removal from the high - risk list .
This year 's Red List looks at 5,487 mammals , and concludes that 1,141 are currently on the path towards disappearance .
Within our lifetime , hundreds of species could be lost as a result of our own actions
Julia Marton - Lefevre , IUCN
This may be an under -estimate , the authors caution , as there is not enough data to make an assessment in more than 800 cases .
The true figure could be nearer to one - third .
" Within our lifetime , hundreds of species could be lost as a result of our own actions , a frightening sign of what is happening to the ecosystems where they live , " said Julia Marton - Lefevre , director - general of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) which publishes the Red List .
" We must now set clear targets for the future to reverse this trend , to ensure that our enduring legacy is not to wipe out many of our closest relatives . "
The report 's authors said the current concern with financial matters must not be allowed to obstruct the decline in the Earth 's natural systems .
" The financial crisis is nothing compared with the environmental crisis , " the deputy head of IUCN 's species programme , Jean - Christophe Vie , told BBC News .
" It 's going to affect a few people , whereas the biodiversity crisis is going to affect the entire world .
So there is a risk that because of the financial crisis , people are going to say ' yeah , the environment is not that urgent ' ; it is really urgent . "
About 40 % of mammal species are compromised because human expansion is putting a squeeze on their habitat .
This is especially important across the tropics , the regions with the highest diversity of land - based mammals .
South and Southeast Asia are identified as regions where extinctions are especially likely in coming years , as that is where the size and living standards of the human population are rising fastest .
Demise of the devils and other mammals under threat
In pictures
The second biggest threat on land is identified as hunting , for food or medicines .
However , where hunting has been controlled and conservation programmes implemented , as with southern and eastern populations of the African elephant , populations and entire species can recover .
The elephant 's risk status is lowered from Vulnerable to Near Threatened .
Some species are included for very specific reasons , such as the Tasmanian devil which has been decimated by a viral cancer .
In the seas , bycatch - entanglement in fishing nets , which is usually although not always accidental - emerges as the biggest factor behind current declines , affecting a staggering 79 % of marine mammals .
The assessment - which is also published in the journal Science - warns that lack of data about marine mammals may be masking a bigger decline .
" Whales , dolphins , porpoises , and sirenians ( manatees and dugong ) are so difficult to survey that declines that should result in a Vulnerable listing would go undetected at least 70 % of the time , " the authors write .
Outside the mammal arena , the Indian tarantula enters the Red List for the first time , a consequence of over - harvesting for the pet trade .
A further 366 amphibians have been added to the list .
This is the most threatened animal group of all , with about one - third on the high - risk list .
A new assessment of climate impacts on the natural world suggests that many species not currently on the danger list will enter it as temperatures rise , particularly in East Africa and parts of South America .
RED LIST DEFINITIONS
Extinct - Surveys suggest last known individual has died Critically Endangered - Extreme high risk of extinction .
Some Critically Endangered species are also tagged Possibly Extinct Endangered - Species at very high risk of extinction Vulnerable - Species at high risk of extinction Near Threatened - May soon move into above categories Least Concern - Species is widespread and abundant Data Deficient - not enough data to assess
The Red List is published approximately once every year .
Although designed as the definitive global list of threatened species , in practice the rankings come from assessments covering different types of plants and animals , and some areas of the list will be more up to date than others .
An assessment of sharks , originally slated for inclusion this year , was delayed and will probably be released later in the year .
In an attempt to make species assessments more certain , the Zoological Society of London ( ZSL ) is developing what they colloquially term a " Dow Jones index " for biodiversity .
The idea is to take a random sample of all the world 's species , which will be representative of the whole , and revisit it regularly - perhaps once every five years - to gain a better idea of global trends .
" We are now emerging from the dark ages of conservation knowledge , when we relied on data from a highly restricted subset of species , " said Jonathan Baillie , ZSL 's director of conservation programmes .
The first group to be assessed this way is the land - dwelling vertebrates , but the project will eventually encompass insect , fungi , plants , and various types of marine creatures .

What are these ?
Thanks to a f*****g stupid error , the iTunes Music Store in the UK has accidentally censored thousands of songs , albums , and artists ' names .
Innocent songs — like Danny Kaye's " I Thought I Saw A P***y Cat " — and not - so - innocent ones — like Nirvana 's " Smells Like T**n Spirit " — have been asterisked by what an Apple spokeswoman has described as a " database glitch " .
Why " teen " , " hot " or " Johnny " can be considered offensive , I really do n't have a flying f**k , but things look rather silly in there :
Advertisement
Yeah , definitely looks fucked up to me .
Oops .
According to Apple UK , the problem happened when they tried to censor potentially offensive words , and here is precisely where I get lost , because they were looking for " teen " , " hot " or " Johnny " .
Hello ?
I understand a database glitch leading to innocent songs to be censored , but that word selection ?
For sure , the dick and the dyke in " D**k Van D* *e " can be considered offensive by some , but the Johnny in " J****y Cash " or the hot in Avril Lavigne 's " H*t " ?
Seems to me like a level of idiotic politically correct censorship that not even the FCC will apply here in the United States .
[ BBC News ]
Oh , and talking about censorship and the FCC , I just can't have enough of this one :
Or this one , for that matter .
There is a business behind the popular Ubuntu Linux operating system and according to its lead commercial sponsor Canonical , that business is good .
Canonical is set to debut its latest Linux release Ubuntu 8.10 also known as the Intrepid Ibex on October 30th .
The new release will include networking , virtualization and user management improvements .
The Ibex release will also be a milestone for Canonical , a company that is barely four years old that is now challenging established Linux and proprietary vendors alike .
Canonical is claiming that its users , contributors and revenues are all growing as Ubuntu aims to grow its overall share of the operating system market .
" In terms of numbers we 're very confident this is an 8 million plus user base of active users , " Chris Kenyon , director of business development at Canonical told InternetNews.com .
" That is a hard thing to count and there are lots of issues about methodology for counting but I have seen nothing that sheds doubts on that . "
Other Linux distributions , like Red Hat 's Fedora , for example , use the Smolt system , which counts users based on the number of unique IP addresses that get updates .
For the current Fedora 9 release , Smolt has counted 1.2 million unique IPs .
The Fedora 6 release in 2007 reported more than two million unique IPs .
In a recent analyst event , Red Hat executive vice president Paul Cormier noted in a presentation that Red Hat currently has over 2.5 million paid subscriptions for its Red Hat Enterprise Linux offerings .
Both Fedora and Ubuntu are available for free , though Canonical also offers paid commercial support for Ubuntu users .
Kenyon did not elaborate on how many paid users Canonical currently supports .
That does n't mean that Canonical is n't making money .
" We 're not sharing our revenues publicly but I will say revenue growth is extremely strong and we 're bullish across the board both at server side and desktop , " Kenyon said .
" The difference between now and even 12 months ago in terms of size and volume of deals coming through is a big difference . "
Big partners , many friends
Canonical has been focused on growing its partner base with vendors like IBM ( NYSE : IBM ) , Sun ( NASDAQ : JAVA ) and Dell ( NASDAQ : DELL ) certifying hardware or software to run Ubuntu Linux .
There are still some big holdouts thought like Oracle and SAP , though Kenyon hinted that some other significant partner announcements are in the works .
" We 'd expect there will be further significant announcements on that [ partners ] thread before the end of the year , " Kenyon commented .
" In terms of the large ISVs , we already have a good story with IBM DB2 , Websphere , and now Lotus Notes as well . "
There are other key metrics that Canonical is keen to point out , among them is their growing headcount of contributors and staff .
Kenyon claimed that the number of people that are actually contributing lines of code continues to grow .
" We now have over 400 active contributors , " Kenyon said .
" That 's on top of our own internal development team that is now at 120 plus developers . "
Overall , Canonical now has 215 employees , a number that Kenyon noted has been growing thanks to revenue growth .
Community participation is also high in terms of Ubuntu user forums with over 600,000 members .
" That just means there is an enormous library of great questions with generally great answers , " Kenyon said .
The release of Intrepid Ibex later this week may help grow desktop users , though Kenyon was less optimistic on the server side .
The previous Ubuntu release , 8.04 " Hardy Heron " was what Canonical calls a long - term support release .
Ubuntu LTS releases come our every two years and offer three years of support on the desktop and five years on the server .
" On the server side we 're not number one and we still have a story to prove to the ISVs , " Kenyon stated .
" I think 8.10 is part of that journey but it ' not as significant a milestone at the 8.04 release .
We 're still finding with ISVs that 8.04 will be the target for another year . "
Congressman Brad Sherman of California 's 27th congressional district told the House in a speech on Thurs evening that several fellow Congressional representatives have said they were threatened with the prospect ' Martial Law ' should they vote in opposition to the $ 700 billion bailout .
Congressman Sherman 's revelation comes after multiple claims that this threat was being ramped up to aid the now $ 850 billion bail out through the House this past Friday .
( Image by Unknown Owner ) Details DMCA
According to numerous Congressional testimonies , the stark panic atmosphere which has gripped both Congress and the US media was intentionally created in order to ' fast - track ' a financial bailout bill .
Several members of Congress were told before Monday 's vote that martial law might be instigated in America if the legislation failed .
During his speaking time on Thurs , Congressman Sherman stated explicitly , " Many of us were told in private conversations , that if we did n't pass this bill on Monday , the sky would fall , the market would drop two or three thousand points , another couple thousand the second day , and a few members were even told that there would be Martial Law in America if we voted no ( to the bail out bill ) . "
Earlier this week , Congressman Michael C. Burgess from the 26th District of Texas , went public on Monday stating live on Infowars nationwide radio broadcast , that House speaker Nancy Pelosi had declared House Rule 136A , effectively putting the House under " Martial Law " rules , a dictatorial measure only activated during times of national emergency .
Analysts and Congressmen alike have equated these threats to " fearmongering " and described as a form of " economic terrorism " carried out by powerful banking interests in order to secure the record $ 850 billion payout to the banks by the American people .
Physical Martial law may be invoked by the President of the United States in case of any deemed " state of emergency " .
Martial Law has not been put into practice since Lincoln , where several Congressmen were arrested or put under house arrest .
In 1878 , Congress passed the Posse Comitatus Act , which forbids military involvement in domestic law enforcement without congressional approval .
However , both the Military Commissions Act of 2006 and USNORTHCOM has increased its direct involvement with US civilian administration .
Additionally , the John Warner Defense Authorization
Act of 2007 , and President Bush 's recent PD51 may possibly rescind previous limits by suspending Government as well as other Constitutional guarantees such as habeas corpus .

NAIROBI , Kenya ( CNN ) --
The crew of a supertanker are reported safe after pirates hijacked the vessel laden with oil and then holed up in lawless Somalia .
Two more ships were attacked Tuesday off the East African coast and a third was seized Saturday but only reported Tuesday , according to a monitoring agency .
The spate of hijackings underscores a dramatic increase in piracy that has alarmed national governments and shipping companies around the world .
" This is completely unprecedented , " said Michael Howlett , assistant director of the International Maritime Bureau in London , which tracks pirate attacks .
" We 've never seen a situation like this . "
The three hijackings reported Tuesday bring to 95 the number of incidents involving pirates and commercial vessels off the East African coast this year -- up from 31 incidents in 2007 and 10 in 2006 , Howlett said .
The Sirius Star supertanker attacked Saturday weighs more than 300,000 metric tons and the ship 's operator says it is fully loaded with oil .
Industry sources say that could mean as much as 2 million barrels .
Its 25 - man crew -- including British , Croatian , Polish , Filipino and Saudi nationals -- are reported to be safe , according to Dubai - based Vela International Marine .
" Our first and foremost priority is ensuring the safety of the crew , " said Vela President Salah Kaaki .
" We are in communication with their families and are working toward their safe and speedy return . "
The Saudi - owned vessel is the largest ship seized to date in the escalating regional piracy crisis .
Watch how attack may point to expansion in piracy in region »
It was captured more than 450 nautical miles southeast of Mombasa , Kenya .
The U.S. Navy said the tanker was now anchored off Haradhere , a village reported to be a base for pirate gangs , 300 kilometers ( 180 miles ) north of Mogadishu .
See where hijacking took place . »
Saudi Arabia 's foreign minister , Prince Saud al - Faisal called the hijacking an " outrageous act . "
" I think it will only reinforce the resolve of the countries of the Red Sea and internationally to fight piracy , " he said on a trip to Athens , Greece .
" Piracy is against everybody .
Like terrorism , it is a disease that has to be eradicated . "
On Tuesday morning , pirates hijacked a Thai fishing vessel and a Chinese cargo ship carrying wheat in the waters off the Horn of Africa .
The cargo ship was seized outside of a so - called " security zone " in the Gulf of Aden that military ships have been patrolling since August .
Another two dozen or so pirate attacks have been successfully thwarted in the Gulf of Aden since the U.S. Navy and other countries increased maritime patrols in August , according to the U.S. Navy 's Fifth Fleet in Bahrain .
A third ship -- a Chinese fishing vessel -- was hijacked Saturday , but word did not reach authorities until Tuesday , Howlett said .
Pirates currently hold 17 vessels and 339 crew members hostage , Howlett said .
The hijacked ships include the MV Faina , a Ukrainian vessel loaded with weapons and tanks that was seized on September 25 along with its 20 crew .
" One ship gets released and another ship is hijacked the next day , " Howlett said .
The burgeoning piracy crisis has flourished in Somalia where almost two decades without a central government has left a country wracked by conflict , chaos and poverty .
Nur Hassan Hussein , the prime minister of Somalia 's transitional government , told CNN Tuesday that shipping companies should stop paying ransom to pirates .
It is not known if Vela is in talks to pay a ransom to the hijackers of the Sirius Star , although money has been paid by other companies to pirates in the past .
Hussein added that international navies operating off the coasts of Africa and the Arabian peninsula need to use force against the pirates who have been hijacking vessels .
The U.S. Navy 's Fifth Fleet said it was not expecting to send ships to intercept the Sirius Star .
NATO also said it would not divert any of three ships currently in the Gulf of Aden , The Associated Press reported .
A multinational naval force including vessels from the U.S. , the UK and Russia has been patrolling the Indian Ocean waters seas near the Gulf of Aden , which connects the Red Sea and the Arabian Sea , following a sharp increase in pirate attacks in the region .
But pirate attacks are spreading farther north to the Gulf of Aden and farther south off the Kenyan coast , said Noel Choong , who heads the International Maritime Bureau 's Piracy Reporting Center .
" The risks are low and the returns are extremely high for these pirates , " Choong told CNN .
Around 20,000 oil tankers , freighters and merchant vessels pass along the crucial shipping route each year .
A Norwegian shipping firm has ordered its vessels to avoid the waters off the Horn of Africa and criticized governments for failing to curb the wave of piracy .
The decision by the maritime company Odfjell SE means its 90 - plus ships will take the additional time and expense to sail around the southern tip of Africa instead of going through the Suez Canal .

You may be interested to know that this document was originally written for internal use in the Operations department at Google .
At the time , I was campaigning for the right to use Ruby on internal projects and I felt that a style and usage guide would probably assist in the battle for the language 's acceptance , as the officially sanctioned languages at the time already had one .
If nothing else , we'd at least all end up writing code that was easier to maintain .
Prologue
Over the last few years , Ruby has struck a chord with programmers as an excellent tool for -- amongst other things -- system administration .
With that as our perspective , this document will suggest some guidelines for writing Ruby code in such a way that a common stylistic vocabulary may emerge , thereby increasing the ease with which source code may be read and shared .
If you have questions about this document , please address them to its author , Ian Macdonald .

Tips for Productive Ruby Programming
An Admonishment
As you read this guide , try to keep in mind that the primary objective is to help you write legible code .
Source code is a write - once / read - many - times medium , so do n't be tempted to explore how much you can cram onto a single line or how you can employ side - effects in new and interesting ways .
Leave the ostentation to the Perl world .
And even if you are cleverer than the rest of us , that 's all the more reason to write code with us lesser mortals in mind , because you 'll probably find yourself working alongside us one day .
The good news is that Ruby itself goes a long way towards helping you write clear code ; the rest is up to you .
irb
irb stands for Interactive Ruby .
It gives you an interactive environment for trying out snippets of code and discovering what works and what does n't .
Its use can greatly decrease the amount of time you spend in the edit - run - debug cycle .
Additionally , it 's a great way to familiarise yourself with the language , as it offers features such as method name completion and automatic printing of the result of each line or block of evaluated code .
Getting used to using irb as a standard part of your development cycle and take advantage of its many features .
As a quick demonstration of the power of irb , we see in the following code which methods can be called with a Fixnum object ( which is basically an integer ) as the receiver :
[ ianmacd@baghdad ] $ irb irb( main ) : 001:0 > 42 .< Tab > 42.modulo 42.__id__ 42.next 42.__send__ 42.nil ?

Similarly , " foo " . < Tab > would show you a list of all methods that you can invoke on an object of class String :

This works for any object and , since in Ruby everything is an object , even classes and modules , it means you can discover how to manipulate the entire object space and try out anything you want .
If you find that completion does n't work for you , try starting irb as follows :
irb -- readline -r irb/ completion
ri
ri is to Ruby what perldoc is to Perl .
The name stands for Ruby Interactive ( not to be confused with Interactive Ruby ) .
To see a list of all the classes for which ri has documentation , type the following :
ri -c
Then try accessing the documentation for a sample class :
ri Hash
On my system , that results in the following :
------------------------------------------------------------
Class : Hash A
Hash is a collection of key - value pairs .
It is similar to an Array , except that indexing is done via arbitrary keys of any object type , not an integer index .
The order in which you traverse a hash by either key or value may seem arbitrary , and will generally not be in the insertion order .
Hashes have a default value that is returned when accessing keys that do not exist in the hash .
By default , that value is nil .
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Includes : Enumerable ( all ? , any ? , collect , detect , each_with_index , entries , find , find_all , grep , include ? , inject , map , max , member ? , min , partition , reject , select , sort , sort_by , to_a , to_set , zip ) Class methods : [ ] , new Instance methods : == , [ ] , [ ]= , clear , default , default= , default_proc , delete , delete_if , each , each_key , each_pair , each_value , empty ? , fetch , has_key ? , has_value ? , include ? , index , indexes , indices , initialize_copy , inspect , invert , key ? , keys , length , member ? , merge , merge ! , rehash , reject , reject ! , replace , select , shift , size , sort , store , to_a , to_hash , to_s , update , value ? , values , values_at
Next , try viewing the documentation for a given method .
I 'll pick one from the Array class , rather than Hash , just to give you as much variety as possible :
ri ' Array # <<'
This gives :
---------------------------------------------------------------
Array #<< array << obj => array
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Append --- Pushes the given object on to the end of this array .
This expression returns the array itself , so several appends may be chained together .
[ 1 , 2 ] << " c " << " d " << [ 3 , 4 ] # => [ 1 , 2 , " c " , " d " , [ 3 , 4 ] ]
As you can see , you will sometimes need to quote the method name , in this case << , to avoid the shell interpreting certain metacharacters .
In one of your shell 's start - up files , you may care to alias ri to ri -f ansi , which will ensure you get a nice coloured display ( as in the example above ) when displaying documentation .
It should be clear to you that ri is an unmissable tool in any Ruby programmer 's toolbox .
The Ruby Debugger
The Ruby debugger is a library loaded into Ruby at run-time .
This is done as follows :
ruby -r debug [ options ] [ programfile ] [ arguments ]
The debugger can do all the usual sorts of things you would expect it to , such as set breakpoints , step into and over code , print out the call stack , etc .
We wo n't go into the debugger in detail here .
We simply wanted to make you aware of its existence , as no programming toolkit is complete without one .
Dave Thomas has written extensive documentation on the subject .
Benchmarking
Ruby comes with a benchmarking module that can help you determine the fastest approach to tackling a given problem .
The following snippet of code , again an example by Dave Thomas , shows the benchmarking of two loops .
One declares a variable once outside of the loop , so that it persists when the loop ends .
The other assigns to the variable within the loop , so that it is created local to the block on each iteration .
require " benchmark " include Benchmark n = 1000000 bm ( 12 ) do |test| test.report ( " normal : " ) do n.times do |x| y = x + 1 end end test.
report ( " predefine : " ) do x = y = 0 n.times do |x| y = x + 1 end end end
When run , the following output is generated :
user system total real normal : 0.920000 0.000000 0.920000 ( 0.978238 ) predefine : 0.720000 0.000000 0.720000 ( 0.761112 )
As you can see , it 's a good 20 % faster to predefine y outside of the iterator block , rather than create a block - local y variable on each iteration , which must then also be garbage - collected .
Running your code through the benchmarking module will slow it down tremendously , but the experience can be very worthwhile .
Profiling
Related to benchmarking is the subject of profiling .
It probably wo n't surprise you by now to learn that Ruby also has a profiling module .
Here 's some sample code , once again courtesy of Dave Thomas :
require " profile " class Peter def initialize ( amt ) @value = amt end def rob( amt ) @value -= amt amt end end class Paul def initialize @value = 0 end def pay ( amt ) @value += amt amt end end peter = Peter.new ( 1000 ) paul = Paul.new 1000.times do paul.pay ( peter.rob ( 10 ) )
end
The output of this is below .
% cumulative self self total time seconds seconds calls ms / call ms / call name 45.83 0.11 0.11 1000 0.11 0.12 Peter#rob 25.00 0.17 0.06 1 60.00 240.00 Integer#times 20.83 0.22 0.05 1000 0.05 0.06 Paul#pay 4.17 0.23 0.01 1000 0.01 0.01 Fixnum #- 4.17 0.24 0.01 1000 0.01 0.01 Fixnum# + 0.00 0.24 0.00 1 0.00 0.00 Paul#initialize 0.00 0.24 0.00 4 0.00 0.00 Module#method_added 0.00 0.24 0.00 2 0.00 0.00 Class#inherited 0.00 0.24 0.00 1 0.00 0.00 Peter#initialize 0.00 0.24 0.00 1 0.00 240.00 # toplevel 0.00 0.24 0.00 1 0.00 0.00 Profiler__.start_profile 0.00 0.24 0.00 2 0.00 0.00 Class#new
You do n't even have to add the require ' profile ' line to your program .
You can just run ruby - rprofile my_program to get the same effect .
Incidentally , the profiling module in profiler.rb consists of just 59 lines of Ruby .
Not bad for such a functional module !
Writing Ruby Unit Tests
Ruby includes the Test :: Unit module specifically for the purpose of writing unit tests .
Using this library is criminally simple ; so much so , in fact , that it would be a crime to write any more code that does not use unit tests to verify its correct working .
Here are the steps to creating and using unit tests in Ruby :
Require ' test / unit ' in your test script .
Create a class that subclasses Test :: Unit :: TestCase .
.
Add a method that begins with " test " to your class .
Make assertions in your test method .
Optionally define # setup and / or #teardown to set up and / or tear down your common test fixture .
Yes , it really is that easy .
Here 's an example from the Ruby / Password library 's unit tests .
require ' test /unit ' require ' password ' class TC_PasswordTest < Test :: Unit :: TestCase def test_check # Check for a weak password .
pw = Password.new ( ' foo ' ) assert_raises ( Password : : WeakPassword ) { pw.check } # Check for a good password .
pw = Password.new ( ' G@7flAxg ' ) assert_nothing_raised { pw.check } # Check for an exception on bad dictionary path .
assert_raises ( Password : : DictionaryError ) { pw.check ( '/ tmp/nodict ' ) } end end
The above code checks the strength of a simplistic password , foo , to ensure that a Password : : WeakPassword exception is raised .
Then , it checks that a much more reasonable password , G@7 flAxg does not raise an exception .
Finally , a third check is performed to ensure that passing the Password # check method a path to a non-existent dictionary yields a Password : : Dictionary Error exception .
Each individual test within a test method is referred to as an assertion and you should write as many of them as you can devise .
You really can't ever have too many , when it comes to unit tests .
When this is run , output similar to that below is generated if no tests fail :
$ ./tc_password.rb Loaded suite ./tc_password Started ......... Finished in 3.692666 seconds .
9 tests , 10007 assertions , 0 failures , 0 errors
As you can see , there are actually many more tests in this library 's test suite than just the one shown above .
In reality , you may find yourself writing more lines of unit test code than in the actual code you are testing !
Whilst all this work may seem like overkill , it will yield dividends later when you come back several months from now to perform more work on your code .
Things that you have long since forgotten were fragile and easily broken will no longer need to be manually checked after changes to the code .
Just run your unit tests and hope no exceptions are raised .

Vim
Vim comes with useful syntax and indentation files for Ruby .
Editing Ruby code will be much faster and easier if you make use of these .
In addition , Red Hat Linux 's Vim package has a Ruby interpreter compiled into it .
This enables you to use Ruby as a text filter , passing a block of text through some arbitrary Ruby code and replacing it with the result .
This is handy when you want to do something that is too difficult or even impossible using Vim 's own features .
You can also use Ruby to access Vim internals .
For example , the following code would set the height of the current window to 70 lines :
:ruby VIM ::Window.current.height = 70
For more information , execute the following command in Vim :
: help ruby
Emacs
Ruby has an ruby - mode.el file that provides a Ruby mode for Emacs .
FIXME : an Emacs user needs to elaborate on this .
Ruby Style Guidelines
Programs are much easier to maintain when all of their components have a consistent style .
The remainder of this document sets forth general stylistic guidelines that are commonly adhered to in the Ruby community .
We ask that you , too , make an effort to adhere to them when writing Ruby code .
Organisation
Order your code as follows :
header block with author 's name , Perforce
Id tag and a brief description of what the program or library is for .
require statements
statements include statements
statements class and module definitions
main program section
testing code
Testing code would look something like this :
if __FILE__ == $ 0 ... end
That should look familiar to you if you have done any Python programming .
Warnings
We recommend that you invoke your scripts with the following shebang line , plus whichever extra command - line options are appropriate for your needs :
#!/usr/bin/ruby -w
This will ensure that you always run the same interpreter ( do not use env ( 1 ) ) and that any warnings generated by your code or the libraries you include will be displayed , so that you can decide how to proceed .
If the warnings get too noisy and you are certain they are not worth silencing by changing your code , you can turn off warnings for a section of your code by setting $ VERBOSE to nil .
Even better is to codify this in a method :
def silently ( &block ) warn_level = $ VERBOSE $ VERBOSE = nil result = block .
call $ VERBOSE = warn_level result end
Since this method takes a block as its parameter , you can now pass it arbitrary chunks of code to execute without warnings :
silently { require ' net/https ' }
Exceptions
Exceptions are a means of breaking out of the normal flow of control of a block of code in order to handle errors or other exceptional conditions .
For those not used to working with them , they can initially seem awkward and difficult to anticipate .
However , once you become accustomed to using them , you will find they reduce the need for a lot of explicit error - checking .
This , in turn , helps reduce code- clutter .
An important reason to use exceptions is that it 's frequently better that a program not continue after an unexpected condition or error arises , rather than continue to run with unknown data , perhaps with devastating consequences .
When you use exceptions in your own libraries , you may care to subclass one of the base exception classes for your own needs .
This makes the exceptions more specific to your use and allows for later customisation .
Be specific about the exceptions you are catching in your rescue clauses .
This helps avoid trapping errors of one kind and treating them as another , which might otherwise lead to misleading diagnostic messages and a longer debugging cycle than if the error had n't been trapped at all .
Use the ensure clause to execute finalising code , regardless of whether an exception was raised in the preceding begin block .
This is often useful for clean - up ( e.g. closing a file ) , which is something that always needs to be done , whether or not an exception occurred during the handling of the file .
Here 's an example .
begin file = open ( " / tmp/some_file " , " w " ) # do stuff here ensure file .
close end
Global variables
Global variables are occasionally useful for quick scripts that will never be reused .
However , they can rapidly cause namespace conflicts and accidental references in larger programs .
For this reason , global variables are pretty much completely shunned by the Ruby community and you are strongly advised to follow suit .
The sole exceptions to this are :
one - liners commands issued at the command - line with ruby -e are not written to file , so by definition they will not be reused in any significant way .
It 's fine to use global variables , such as $ _ here .
predefined global variables such as $. , $! and $ ? .
The use of these variables is necessary , although you are encouraged to require ' English ' when you do so , in order to improve code readability .
Just to be clear , constants are an entirely different matter .
These are global to the module or class in which they are defined , but they are fine to use .
Re-use of constants will , in any case , generate a warning .
Boolean values
Ruby considers nil and false to be false , and all other values to be true .
This is one of the major obvious differences from Perl , with which Ruby shares many superficial similarities .
In Perl , 0 , the null string and undef are all considered false for the purposes of Boolean logic .
In Ruby , however , 0 and the null string both evaluate to true .
Ruby also has the Boolean values of true and false , unlike Perl .
If you 're coming from a Perl background , the important thing to remember is that you will need more explicit tests for empty strings and zero values than you are used to , such as :
if foo.empty ? ... end
if foo.zero ? ... end
These can be rewritten in more Perl - like syntax , if that better suits your taste .
if foo == " " ... end
if foo == 0 ... end
Default Parameter values
You can specify values for variables as part of a method 's parameter list , e.g .
def foo ( a , b=0 , c=" zip " ) ... end
foo
b
c
b
c
Default parameter values are particularly useful when a method has lots of parameters , most of which only rarely need to have a different value .
Using default parameters allows you to avoid having to specify values for every method call .
Initialisation
Ruby allows several ways to instantiate base objects .
For example , each of the following pairs are equivalent :
foo = " " foo = String.new
foo = [ ] foo = Array.new
foo = {} foo = Hash.new
We really have no preference for which form you use .
The first form is idiomatic enough across multiple languages that an experienced programmer in other languages will recognise and understand these declarations even if they have not seen Ruby before .
However , the second form is arguably clearer still , as even a non-programmer would understand these declarations .
An important fact to bear in mind is that the new method of many of these classes sometimes takes one or more parameters , sometimes even a block .
This allows you to determine in advance , for example , which hash values will be automatically created the first time their keys are referenced .
For more information , use ri to view the documentation for the Array.new and Hash . new methods .
In - line Evaluation
Ruby is an extremely dynamic language , which means that code can be generated and executed on the fly .
This includes the definition of new classes and methods , as well as the overloading of operators .
Existing classes can even be reopened and have methods added , removed and redefined .
This allows for extremely flexible and efficient coding .
For example , a small loop can generate dozens of similar methods , rather than the programmer having to define each one by hand .
Imagine , for example , a SOAP library that reads a WSDL file and generates methods for each of the remote procedures it defines .
In fact , Ruby 's own SOAP4R library works in exactly this way .
Be wary of this kind of technique .
Whilst powerful , it can make bugs very hard to track down and test .
Because code generation is dynamic , unit tests will also be unable to test the entire code .
As such , we recommend you use dynamic method generation sparingly and only where it makes perfect sense ( as in the SOAP example ) .
Similarly , avoid Kernel#eval where possible and resort to Object#send , Module # class_eval , Module # module_eval and Object # instance_eval where possible .
These methods , whilst less dangerous , are also best avoided where an alternative exists .
Semi-colons
Ruby allows the use of the semi-colon as a statement separator .
This means you can place one at the end of a line and also use it as a way to put multiple statements on a single line .
Do n't do this .
A semi-colon at the end of the line is superfluous and placing multiple statements on one line decreases the legibility of your code .
A rare exception is when writing a compound statement , coupled with a statement modifier :
( $ stderr.puts " Error ! " ; exit 1 ) unless x == 2
But even then , it 's rather ugly .
Another minor variation on this theme is variable assignment .
Instead of this :
level = 0 size = 0
it 's possible to write this :
level = size = 0
Be careful with this , however , as most values in Ruby are references .
The above example works , because Fixnum objects are immediate values , which means that an assignment of a Fixnum to a variable causes that variable to be assigned the value itself , rather than just a reference to it .
The same is not true of any other type of object , except Bignum objects , true , false and nil .
For example :
irb ( main ) :001:0 > foo = bar = Array.new => [ ] irb( main ) : 002:0 > foo => [ ] irb( main ) :003:0 > bar => [ ] irb( main ) : 004:0 > foo << " baz " => [ " baz " ] irb( main ) : 005:0 > foo => [ " baz " ] irb( main ) : 006:0 > bar => [ " baz " ]
As you can see here , both foo and bar are clearly references to the same object .
Line length
The maximum length of any line of your code should be 80 characters ( some would even say 79 ) .
The only exceptions should be complex regular expressions and other constructs that are difficult to break over multiple lines .
Make use of Ruby 's implied line continuation .
Basically , if Ruby can determine that a statement is syntactically incomplete , it will expect it to be continued on the next line :
puts
" This line appears to end " if foo == bar
The above example confuses Ruby , since the first line is a valid statement in its own right .
If , however , the if modifier were moved to the end of the first line , Ruby could then determine that there must be more code to come .
Basically , the rule of thumb is that you should try to break a line after a comma or an operator .
If you can't imply that a line continues by using syntactically incomplete statements , terminate the line with a backslash , as you would if you were writing a shell script .
Ruby will then continue parsing on the next line .
Indentation
Indent your code with two spaces per logical level .
Really , it 's that simple .
Unlike in some other communities , there is no contention in the Ruby community over whether to use two , four or eight spaces .
Everyone is happy to use just two .
Furthermore , never use tabs , which includes the practice of mixing tabs with spaces .
Blank Lines
We recommend two blank lines between each class and module definition , and a single blank line between each method definition .
Whitespace
Use whitespace around the assignment operator , except then assigning default values in method argument lists , i.e. :
foo = 1
not :
foo=1
and :
def foo ( bar , baz=0 )
def foo ( bar , baz = 0 )
Use whitespace to improve the legibility of complex expressions , but do not use whitespace to separate a method name from its parameter list .
Within the parameter list itself , however , whitespace is fine .
For example , this is fine :
foo.bar ( baz )
but this is not :
foo.bar ( baz )
One last place where whitespace is not appropriate is before a comma .
Comments
Document your libraries using RDoc. Rdoc was added to the base Ruby distribution as of 1.8.1 and is capable of producing HTML and ri documentation from your source code .
As such , it is very powerful and you should spend a little time learning it .
It 's really quite simple once you get used to it and one of the nice things about it is that your code really does become self - documenting .
Leaving a blank comment line before a class , module or method definition makes the comment extra readable , e.g. :
# This method returns the answer to the universe .
# def answer 42 end
RD is on the way out as a form of documentation these days , but can still be useful for making the Ruby interpreter ignore a header or footer in your code , e.g. :
=begin * Name : * Description * Author : * Date : * License : =end
All standard rules of good code commenting practice apply here , too .
In other words , do n't comment the blatantly obvious , such as i = i + 1 , but do otherwise include lucid comments thoughout your code .
Annotate particularly gruesome or unimplemented sections with FIXME and an explanation of what work remains to be done .
Strings
Use either single or double quotes around your strings unless you need to embed one type of quote in the string itself , in which case you should use the other type .
If you require variable interpolation to take place , single quotes will not work , e.g. :
foo = " bar " x = ' foo = # {foo} ' => " foo = # {foo} " x = " foo = # {foo} " => " foo = bar "
Consider using alternative forms of interpolation , however :
x = sprintf ( " foo = %s " , foo ) x = " foo = %s " % [ foo ] x = % Q ( works like a " double - quoted " string and embedded " characters work fine ) x = %q ( a ' single ' - quoted string with embedded ' characters ) x = % w [ an array of words ]
Also , onsider the use of so - called here documents for multi-line strings :
print << EOF Usage : foo < bar >
Call foo with bar as an argument EOF
Binding
Be aware of how tightly operators bind .
This is an issue in Ruby , as it is in Perl and many other languages .
For example :
puts nil || " foo " # parses to : puts ( nil || " foo " ) => prints " foo " puts nil or " foo " # parses to : puts ( nil ) || " foo " => prints nil
Block Style
Ruby allows the construction of iterator blocks using either do and end or braces ( {} ) .
Common practice dictates sticking to do and end , except when the entire iterator block fits on a single line .
For example :
foo.each do |x| puts x x *= 2 puts x end
but :
large = foo.find_all { |x| x > 10 }
Libraries
As of this writing , Ruby has multiple libraries for achieving some similar ends .
For example , getopts and parsearg are both libraries for command - line option parsing , but there is also getoptlong and the even the newer optparse library .
In general , when more than one library exists to fulfill a specific need , you should use the newest of the set .
Not only will the newer libraries almost certainly be better than the ones they replace , but the next version of Ruby will likely deprecate the use of some of the older libraries and issue warnings when they are loaded .
Eventually , such libraries will be removed , so plan ahead and use the newer libraries in your code .
In addition to getopts and parsearg , the following libraries should no longer be used in new code :
Deprecated Use instead cgi-lib cgi importenv none ftools fileutils
Access Control
Access to instance variables in Ruby happens via explicitly declared reader , writer and accessor methods .
There can be no accidental access .
Avoid Object #instance_variable_set and Object #instance_variable_get , unless you 're doing something very clever and you 're sure it 's justified .
If in doubt , ask one of your Ruby - programming colleagues .
Designate your methods private or protected , as appropriate .
Naming
Avoid single character variable names for anything except counters and iterators .
The standard Ruby file extension is .rb , although many people working on UNIX - like systems do n't bother with it for stand - alone scripts .
Whether or not you use it for scripts is up to you , but you will need to use it for library files or they will not be found by the interpreter .
Class and module names should be in camel - case , e.g :
Class BigFatObject
Class names should be nouns .
In the case of modules , it 's harder to make a clear recommendation .
The names of mix-ins ( which are just modules ) should , however , probably be adjectives , such as the standard Enumerable and Comparable modules .
Constants should be named using all upper - case characters and underscores , e.g .
BigFatObject ::MAX_SIZE
They should also be nouns .
Method names should be named using all lower - case characters and underscores .
If possible , the name should be a verb , e.g .
BigFatObject#pare_down
Variable names should be named using all lower - case characters and underscores , but unlike method names , try to pick nouns , e.g. size .
This applies to local , global , instance and class variables alike .
However , there 's a case to be made for keeping the names of local variables shorter than those of variables that will be made externally available , such as instance variables .
For example , you might want to use resp_code as a local variable , but @response_code as an instance variable .
Parentheses
Ruby allows you to omit the parentheses between a method name and its parameter list .
In the majority of cases , you should not do this and a warning will be generated by the interpreter if you do .
However , certain methods are commonly used without parentheses , such as Kernel # require , Module #include , Kernel#p and the attr_* methods .
Safe Levels
If you 've done any Perl programming , you 'll know the importance of taint - checking when it comes to handling externally derived data , such as environment variables or the form fields returned by an HTTP POST operation from an HTML form .
Ruby also has the concept of safe modes of operation , but whereas Perl offers just one , Ruby offers no fewer than four modes of heightened security , each offering incremental improvements over the previous .
Thanks to Dave Thomas for the descriptions below .
Level Description 0
No checking of the use of externally supplied ( tainted ) data is performed .
This is Ruby 's default mode .
>= 1 Ruby disallows the use of tainted data by potentially dangerous operations .
>= 2 Ruby prohibits the loading of program files from globally writable locations .
>= 3
All newly created objects are considered tainted . >= 4 Ruby effectively partitions the running program in two .
Nontainted objects may not be modified .
Typically , this will be used to create a sandbox : the program sets up an environment using a lower $ SAFE level , then resets $ SAFE to 4 to prevent subsequent changes to that environment .
We strongly encourage you to use safe levels whenever there is any doubt as to the trustworthiness of the data you are handling .
In fact , we 're paranoid enought to suggest that you raise the safe level of your program even when you are handling trusted data .
Doing so will make a future editor of your code think twice about adding insecure operations .
A full explanation of safe levels is beyond the scope of this document , so we refer you instead to this thorough treatment .
External Commands
Related to the previous point is the question of when to call external commands .
Ruby , like Perl , is an extremely useful glue language , which means that if you 've got some software that looks like a square peg and some other software that looks like a round hole , Ruby acts like a lathe ( or perhaps a very large hammer , depending on your approach ) to make the peg fit the hole .
Anyway , when programming , it 's common to want to call external commands and either format or make decisions based on their output .
This is dangerous for a number of reasons .
Firstly , you can never be certain that you are invoking the binary you think you are .
This is a security risk .
Secondly , binaries get upgraded from time to time and the output you can correctly parse today may not be the output you get presented with tomorrow .
This is a robustness risk .
Thirdly , your code may need to run on multiple platforms .
Calling binaries on UNIX - like systems will not work on Windows systems .
This is a portability risk .
Therefore , when faced with a choice between calling an external binary or spending a little extra time creating a pure Ruby solution , take the latter route .
For example , do n't call stty to switch off terminal echo while you accept a password from the keyboard .
Instead , use the Ruby / Password library .

MOSCOW , Oct 26 ( Reuters ) - Russia has drawn up its own proposals to restructure the world financial system , which President Dmitry Medvedev will present at a global summit on the financial crisis next month , a senior official said on Sunday .
U.S. President George W. Bush will host the summit on Nov. 15 in Washington to discuss the causes of the crisis and the principles by which financial regulators and institutions should be reformed .
Invited to the meeting are leaders of the G20 , which includes the Group of Seven major industrialized nations and key emerging economies like China , Brazil , India and Russia .
Heads of the World Bank , International Monetary Fund , United Nations and the Financial Stability Forum have also been invited .
Russian First Deputy Prime Minister Igor Shuvalov told state channel Vesti that Medvedev ’s proposals contained “ measures on ( revising ) the international financial structure , on how international financial institutions should function , and they also concern national regulation ” .
Shuvalov did not reveal details , but reiterated Russia ’s general stance : “ The currently existing world financial system is inadequate to the conditions in which we live .
In the Russian Federation , our leadership has been constantly talking about this in recent years . ”
Shuvalov said Russia had no plans to isolate itself from the rest of the world during the crisis , stressing that it was part of the global economy .
If the world economy declined , Russia ’s growth would be short - lived , he added .
“ You know that we have ambitious plans for the country ’s development until 2020 , and we have to sustain high growth tempos , ” Shuvalov said .
“ This is why we are interested together with the G20 -- maybe this club will be later broadened -- to stabilise the world financial system and in general achieve positive economic growth , ” he said .
Some analysts say the crisis , accompanied by a fall in energy and commodity prices , will bring an end to a Russian boom which has revived Moscow ’s ambitions to become one of the main world economies and a global political player .
But Medvedev said last week the turmoil gave Russia a chance to modernise its economy and find a stronger international role .
He said the consolidation of assets of Russian companies would make them more competitive and promised government funds to support that process .
Financial organisations could become more effective and attractive for investors .
Russia ’s stock market lost more than a tenth of its value on Friday , hitting its lowest levels since 2004 as a further oil price fall cast fresh doubts over the country ’s ability to avoid a recession and defend its currency .
The rouble RUB= slid a further 23 kopecks to 27.23 rouble per dollar , touching a two - year low , as the U.S. currency rallied on global markets .

1 .
A few years ago , I worked for a company in the semiconductor business .
The company had a development cycle that typically lasted a year from the initial tests to the product release and an environment filled with pressure and energy .
At the time , strong sales and rapidly increasing market share made the company incredibly profitable .
The work paid well and I enjoyed the company of my coworkers .
Then one day , I quit .
I had considered leaving for a long time .
For months , I had repetitive work absent of challenge .
Twice I had negotiated with my management for changes that they later reneged .
The third time this happened , I had already ceased to care and resigned .
As a kid , I had developed a taste for frugal living , and with my savings , I did n't view my unemployment as a serious problem .
My parents had little skill at handling their finances and I decided early on not to struggle like them .
My great - grandfather , an Iowan farmer whose company I enjoyed enormously , told me how : focus on quality and never take on debt .
He had died many years earlier , but his advice only seemed to get better the older I got .
Naturally , then , I earned money much faster than I spent it .
I rented my house and had no car payments or debt .
I still owned and used much that I had bought over the years .
I did n't have much desire for things that become obsolete or thrown away , and my accumulation of stuff had slowed even as my income increased .
I felt fortunate to have the gift of life and I wanted to live it with as much quality as possible ' quality stuff , and quality friendships , experiences , and thinking .
I worked about 2,500 hours per year , which left me little time for the things I cared about more .
I realized that working just a thousand hours per year would still cover my expenses , leave me with a financial buffer , and a lot more time to boot .
Spending so much time working for money had to end .
2 .
We live in a time of great production of goods , but also of wants .
Few among us have taken Thoreau 's advice to ' Simplify , simplify ' to heart .
Quality of life has become synonymous with consumption , almost in direct proportion .
A little observation reveals a slightly more complex relationship because ownership has overhead expenses .
Stuff not only uses space , it requires maintenance , needs protection from unsavory individuals , and needs an inventory system .
When it takes little effort to accomplish this , having stuff enhances our happiness .
For every person , though , there comes a level of accumulation where the responsibilities of ownership become an outright burden .
Many people , if not most , become curators of their own landfills when they reach this level .
The accumulation of stuff in garages visible in any neighborhood makes the law of diminishing returns visible .
How many hours did these people work to buy all this stuff that they no longer want yet will not discard ?
Money presents another set of issues .
People who do n't have as much as they want oftentimes believe it will give them a feeling of security , or that it will afford them things they believe will give them happiness .
I have heard these beliefs among people with very little in the bank and also from two very rich people .
For those who have saved a substantial sum , they spend many hours focused on its growth , or at least its preservation ' for them , the fear of not having money gets replaced with the fear of its loss .
To find balance and perspective on these issues , I start with this : increasing productivity has created the trend toward higher real wages for the past 200 years .
Any one of us can stay alive and support a decent lifestyle working fewer hours than ever before .
Real median wages have increased by a factor of roughly two since the late 1940s .
Skilled people , of course , tend to do better than that .
Simply recognizing this offers opportunities .
3 .
In the pursuit of a quality life , money provides but one means for getting tangible goods .
I can work for money and exchange it for quality 'in other words , get it indirectly .
Barter provides another .
Alternatively , I can get it directly by working on achieving quality myself .
Economists obsess over the increasing division of labor , efficiency , and opportunity costs , not considering the inverse correlation between happiness and specialization .
Unimpeded curiosity leads us to learn to do what interests us , and since our lives have many dimensions , we naturally develop proficiency in several areas .
Only modern schooling has obscured this fact .
You may recognize that self - reliance and quality oftentimes go hand - in - hand .
For instance , no grocery sells chicken noodle soup that tastes as good as what you can easily make at home .
What you buy usually only approximates what you want , but you can tailor what you make exactly to your wishes .
Time presents the main limitation .
If one works many hours each week as a specialist , then one has but little choice to depend on others for most needs .
A man in this environment literally becomes a component of a machine that creates products by dividing a project into typological fragments .
Specialists for each fragment solve the various problems , but they usually do not see the bigger picture and ultimately , this degrades the quality of the product .
No great sense of accomplishment results from this sort of work , especially when the fungibility of one 's specialty means that many other people could have done the work just as well .
Quality work results from unification , not fragmentation 'we know that a collaboration of specialists can create great work only when each individual sees his place in the bigger picture and cares mightily about the outcome .
Since one may view society as an aggregation of individuals , this working model that so often emphasizes fragmentation lends a clue to understanding our own society 's unbalanced character .
I have found one simple way out , though I did not see it for many years .
I cannot produce electronics , cars , running shoes , and most of the high - technology products that I enjoy at home because their manufacture involves lots of machinery and cost .
What I consume of these products , though , I can purchase with reasonably few hours of paid work .
High - technology products do n't form the basis for my life , however .
For me , the short - list of stuff in a quality life begins with some decidedly low - tech things : a garden , well - prepared meals , a decent home , and some beautifully - crafted objects .
None of these require much money or many hours on the job .
We have the good fortune to live when high productivity has made living well possible with little work .
Taking my example from earlier , a median - income person can consume as someone from the late 1940s by working about half - time today .
This leaves much more time to create the quality stuff and experiences you want .
It lets you focus on living as an individual , not a consumer .
You do n't pay tax on things you make for yourself , your family , or your friends .
Your income and sales taxes diminish , too , while the intangible benefits grow .
Last year when I learned that I would soon become a father , I decided to build a rocking chair for mother and baby to create sort of a physical milestone that would always mark the moment for me , and eventually become something passed on through the generations .
I wanted this chair to result from my work , not the work of machines , and after making some sketches and selecting the rough boards , I planed the wood , sawed the parts , and cut every mortise and tenon by hand , taking the time to fit them perfectly and bring an object of considerable beauty into my home after one or two hundred hours of work .
No one can purchase this sort of satisfaction .
More time affords experiences like this .
In describing the process of good work , Robert Pirsig once wrote ,
I think that when a concept of peace of mind is introduced and made central to the act of technical work , a fusion of classic and romantic quality can take place at a basic level within a practical working context .
I 've said that you can actually see this fusion in skilled mechanics and machinists of a certain sort , and you can see it in the work they do . . .
They have patience , care and attentiveness to what they are doing , but more than this 'there 's a kind of inner peace of mind that is n't contrived but results from a kind of harmony with the work in which there 's no leader and no follower .
The material and the craftsman 's thoughts change together in a progression of smooth , even changes until his mind is at rest at the exact instant the material is right .
Professionals have no monopoly on these experiences , either .
Amateurs , in fact , often do the best work since they do not deal with the financial facts of running a business .
James Krenov , the famous Swedish furniture maker , when asked about making a living once said , ' The better work you do , the more chance that you 'll starve . '
Amateurs , unbothered with concerns like this , have the time to make everything right .
Making time for what you value should come first .
Making enough money to live comfortably takes a small fraction of the 40 - hour workweek that our culture assumes .
By never examining that assumption , most people dedicate the best hours of their days to achieving someone else 's goals instead of their own .
My advice ?
Homebrew your own quality life , and work for others in your spare time .
It works for me .
There are two ways James Bond ’s cars are portrayed in film : seductively sitting still ( often draped with beautiful women ) or blazing across the screen in some of the most exciting car - chase sequences ever made for the big screen .
But in many cases , there has to be some serious lens trickery going on .
When we reviewed our test data for some of James Bond ’s coolest cars , we found that Bond ’s rides have seldom been the fastest cars of their time , and some of them could n’t catch a bad guy on a bicycle .
This could explain why some of those chase scenes take so long .
So , as the latest James Bond flick , Quantum of Solace , is set to open soon , now seems like a great time to present the most famous cars we ’ve seen in the 22 - film James Bond series , along with performance figures gathered from our own road tests over the years .
Aston Martin DB5 , Goldfinger ( 1964 )
4.0 - liter inline - 6 ( 282 hp , 288 lb-ft )
0 –60 mph : 8.1 seconds
Quarter - mile : N / A
If Double - O could pick a favorite among his many slick rides , it might be the silver Aston Martin DB5 first seen in 1964 ’s Goldfinger .
Appearing in many subsequent films and setting the standard for every clever , gadget - laden four - wheeled sexpot he has driven since , the DB5 is also one of Bond ’s slowest rides ever : its 0 - to - 60 - mph time of 8.1 seconds — before the machine guns and smoke - screen equipment were strapped on — would allow it to be outrun by a villain in a VW Rabbit .
No wonder he ’s upgraded to the DBS since then .
Toyota 2000GT
Convertible , You Only Live Twice ( 1967 )
2.0 - liter inline - 4 ( 150 hp , 130 lb - ft )
0 –60 mph : 8.2 seconds
Quarter - mile : 16.3 seconds @ 87 mph
Two icons met in the Far East in 1967 ’s You Only Live Twice : Sean Connery and the exquisite Toyota 2000GT .
And the latter was no ordinary 2000GT , but a convertible — one of two ever built ( both of which were made specifically for this fifth James Bond film ) .
We tested the coupe and found it to be none too quick — 0 to 60 mph took more than eight seconds — but certainly , the 2000GT convertible was one of the most timeless rides to appear in a James Bond movie .
Lotus Esprit S1 , The Spy Who Loved Me ( 1977 )
2.0 - liter inline - 4 ( 140 hp , torque N/A )
0 –60 mph : 9.6 seconds
Quarter - mile : 17.3 seconds @ 79 mph
Another of the most famous Bond cars , the white Lotus Esprit in The Spy Who Loved Me , turned into a submarine after Roger Moore drove it off a deck in Sardinia .
Once in the water , it could spew smoke like an octopus and unleash depth charges .
Back on land , however , it needed nearly 10 seconds to hit 60 .
Subsequent Turbo models would cut that time nearly in half , as Bond himself found out four years later in For Your Eyes Only .
Aston Martin V - 8 , The Living Daylights ( 1987 )
5.3 - liter V - 8 ( hp N/A , torque N/A )
0 –60 mph : 7.8 seconds
Quarter - mile : 15.9 seconds @ 92 mph
Timothy Dalton drove an Aston Martin V - 8 — a car that some of us have called the “ British Barracuda ” on account of its brawny muscularity — in 1987 ’s The Living Daylights .
But with a lazy 0 - to - 60 time of 7.8 seconds , Dalton ’s V - 8 could have been whipped , buttered , and served with crumpets by a 1987 Buick Regal GNX .
Then again , no Buick we can think of has ever come with spiked tires , outrigger skis , lasers , and missiles under the fog lamps .
Advantage : Bond .
BMW Z3 , GoldenEye ( 1995 )
1.9 - liter inline - 4 ( 138 hp , 133 lb- ft )
0 –60 mph : 8.1 seconds
Quarter - mile : 16.3 seconds @ 83 mph
Among the memorable aspects of 1995 ’s GoldenEye is the now - laughable vision of freshman 007 Pierce Brosnan bounding down a sunny road in a narrow - bodied four - cylinder BMW Z3 .
It was perhaps Bond ’s most egregious case of product placement gone awry — the new 2009 VW Jetta TDI casts roughly the same performance footprint .
We might have had more respect for the little Z as a credible Bond ride had it actually used its alleged headlight - mounted Stinger missiles , parachute braking system , or better yet , self - destruct function .
BMW 750iL , Tomorrow Never Dies ( 1997 )
5.4 - liter V - 12 ( 322 hp , 361 lb-ft )
0 –60 mph : 6.3 seconds
Quarter - mile : 14.8 seconds @ 98 mph
Having learned , perhaps , that 138 horsepower is woefully inadequate for someone with James Bond ’s velocity ( and dignity ) requirements , BMW supplied Britain ’s most famous secret agent with a car boasting twice the mass , three times as many cylinders , 236 - percent more horsepower , and about 10 times more machismo than the wimpy Z3 he drove in the previous flick .
No wonder he had two Bond girls this time around .
BMW Z8 , The World is Not Enough ( 1999 )
4.9 - liter V - 8 ( 394 hp , 369 lb-ft )
0 –60 mph : 4.5 seconds
Quarter - mile : 13.0 seconds @ 111 mph
It only took three films , but BMW finally gave James Bond a suitably flattering ride in the form of the stunning , then - new Z8 roadster in 1999 ’s The World is Not Enough .
Of course , Denise Richards also appeared in the movie , but frankly , we ’d rather have seen Richards sawn in half than the Z8 .
Oh , well , the M5 – powered sports car was fast while it lasted and is still Bond - girl beautiful today .
Aston Martin Vanquish , Die Another Day ( 2002 )
5.9 - liter V - 12 ( 460 hp , 400 lb-ft )
0 –60 mph : 4.4 seconds
Quarter - mile : 12.9 seconds @ 115 mph
Bond spent his 40th anniversary in film by returning to Aston Martin as his favored marque after a few stints in BMWs .
In Die Another Day , Bond drove the muscular Vanquish , his fastest car yet .
However , at more than two tons , the Vanquish was none too dainty ( which contributed to its loss to the Ferrari 550 Maranello in our 2001 comparison test ) .
But it was much quicker and far more debonair than the coral - colored Thunderbird driven by Halle Barry , who played the seductive Jinx .
Aston Martin DBS , Casino Royale ( 2006 ) , Quantum of Solace ( 2008 )
5.9 - liter V - 12 ( 510 hp , 420 lb-ft )
0 –60 mph : 4.3 seconds
Quarter - mile : 12.6 seconds @ 117 mph
Bond ’s quickest ride ever also made one of the poorest showings of them all , meeting its demise in a series of spectacular pirouettes and somersaults within about a minute or so of first appearing , steered off the road by novice 007 Daniel Craig to save his hapless female interest , who had been tied up and left in the Aston ’s path .
The DBS gets a chance to redeem itself this year in Quantum of Solace .
We hope Craig has learned how to drive by now .
Morgan Aero 8 , We Wish
4.4 - liter V - 8 ( 380 hp , 362 lb - ft , est )
0 –60 mph : 4.0 seconds ( est )
Quarter - mile : 12.0 seconds @ 120 mph ( est )
As worthy as the gorgeous Aston Martin DBS is of making back - to - back appearances as the Bond car du jour , we believe Bond could have been a trifle more clever this time around by choosing something like the Morgan Aero 8 .
It is surprisingly well engineered yet retains its British character .
More important , it ’s blazingly fast , with the BMW V - 8 posting a 4.2 - second 0 - to -60 jaunt and a 12.7 - second quarter - mile at 110 mph five years ago with far less power than today ’s cars .
The Aero 8 could be the quickest James Bond car in history , at least until he slides into the spectacular One - 77 , which we expect to happen in the next film .

Australia will tip into a shallow recession in early 2009 as a slowing global economy reduces demand for our mineral exports , a leading investment bank says .
JP Morgan Australia chief economist Stephen Walters said downward revisions for global growth for the current quarter and the first quarter of 2009 had led to a more pessimistic outlook for the country .
Mr Walters forecasts Australian GDP growth of 0.7 per cent in 2009 , down from 1.4 per cent , already downgraded last week from 1.8 per cent .
Australia 's GDP growth for the rest of 2008 would fall to 2.1 per cent from the previous forecast of 2.5 per cent , he said .
" These new forecasts include expected falls in Australia 's GDP in Q4 2008 and Q1 2009 .
The Chinese government has stepped in and banned 10 video sites , while giving warnings to 17 others .
The sites were accused of ' regulations violations ' ranging from running a service without authorization , through to displaying violent or horrific content .
None of the charges relate to piracy , even though one of the sites is China 's biggest eDonkey indexing site .
The West would dearly love China to clamp down on Internet piracy , so when 10 video sites were recently banned by the Chinese government and 17 others were issued with warnings , it looked like some progress may have been made .
It was n’t to be .
According to a report from Xinhuanet , China ’s State Administration of Radio Film and Television has taken action against 17 sites it claims violated various regulations , including the publishing of horrific , violent or pornographic content , and operating a video site without proper approval .
None of the sites appeared to have been warned or shuttered due to piracy issues .
One of the sites that has been warned , VeryCD , is China ’s largest eDonkey indexing site .
In operation for around 5 years , it claims to link to more than 30 terabytes of data .
VeryCD also operates a service known as MP3 !
which aims to be the world ’s largest index of MP3 files , which would understandably attract some copyright action .
However , a visit to VeryCD appears to show the site pretty much intact and packed with links to the latest movies , music , games and software .
So , it appears the site was warned , rather than banned .
Details are scarce , what might it have been warned about if it is not related to copyright infringement ?
Of course , pornographic content is available on eDonkey , that is one option .
Another possibility lies in the list of complaints about the various sites – there is one which reads “ spreading video programs that violate national regulations ” .
VeryCD actually created their own version of eMule , which has been downloaded more than 30 million times .
Could that be the cause of the warning ?
Whatever the problem , unusually for a file - sharing site , it was n’t piracy .

Listening to classical music ' can relieve pregnancy stress '
Women who listened to CDs of classical music felt more relaxed during pregnancy than those who did not
Mothers - to - be who listen to lullabies , classical music and sounds of nature are less likely to feel stressed about their pregnancy , a study has shown .
The music 's tempo was set at 60 to 80 beats per minute , the same as the human heart , and was found to ease anxiety and depression .
Scientists split pregnant women into two groups , with 116 given music CDs and 120 , in the control group , receiving normal pregnancy care .
The women using the music received four CDs , each containing about 30 minutes of music .
One CD featured lullabies , a second contained classical music , a third included nature sounds and a fourth played New Age ' crystal music ' versions of Chinese nursery rhymes and songs such as Twinkle Twinkle Little Star .
The women were told to listen to at least one disc all the way through , every day , for two weeks .
They could choose when they listened to the music but had to record what they were doing at the time and which CD they chose .
Most listened while they were resting , at bedtime or carrying out chores .
Widely used measuring systems were utilised to work out how the women felt .
Listening to music such as that of German composer Ludwig van Beethoven can relieve stress in pregnant women
The results showed those in the music group were far less stressed , depressed or anxious at the end of the study .
Professor Chung - Hey Chen , who led the
study at Kaohsiung Medical University in Taiwan , said : ' Pregnancy is a unique and stressful period for many expectant mothers and they suffer anxiety and depression because of the long time period involved .
' Our study shows that listening to suitable music provides a simple , cost - effective and non-invasive way of reducing stress , anxiety and depression during pregnancy . '
The women in the study published in the Journal Of Clinical Nursing were between 18 and 34 weeks ' pregnant .
Before the study , the women in the music group scored 17.44 on the Perceived Stress Scale , which ranges from zero to 30 and is used to measure the perception of stress .
Afterwards , their stress levels had dropped by an average of 2.15 , compared with 0.92 in the control group .
Anxiety was measured by a scale ranging from 20 to 80 .
It fell by 2.13 from 37.92 in the music group and rose by 0.71 in the control group .
Depression was measured by the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale , which ranges from zero to 30 .
The music group reported an average level of 12.11 before the study and a reduction of 1.84 at the end of the two - week period .
The score was almost constant in the control group .
Professor Chen said : ' The music group showed significant reductions in stress , anxiety and depression after just two weeks . '
Enturbulation.org is now down .
This is not do to another DDoS , rather the server seems to have been unplugged .
Admin accounts through our email server have been deleted .
LE has unplugged the server .
In attempts to call him , I have received curses , name calling , memes , loud music in the seconds he answered before hanging up .
The noises back - dropped by the sounds of California Freeways .
At this moment it seems that Enturbulation.org is no more .
Some members of the staff have been discussing this , as well as what we can do for the last 45 minutes .
Our conclusion is to wait until the rest of the staff is awake to continue discussions , and try to contact LE again to see what he has to say .
At the moment , the options in - front of us are if it is wise to recreate enturbulation .
We have database backups , and could have a new site running .
Unfortunately it would be on another domain name .
The question of hardware also comes to mind , although we 've just bought a new server , it 's either at LE 's house or being mailed to him as this is written .
We will try to keep you updated as things unfold .
A paragraph of my post last week about Opera Software , which makes browsers for cellphones and PCs , got a lot of notice on tech blogs .
But , as often happens , the retelling of the story has created an odd snowball of misunderstanding .
I asked Jon Stephenson von Tetzchner , Opera ’s chief executive , about the iPhone , after he mentioned how the Opera Mini browser was popular on other smartphones .
He replied that in fact some Opera engineers had started developing an iPhone version , but the company did n’t pursue it because Apple does n’t allow products on the iPhone that compete with its own software — in this case , the Safari browser .
I wrote that , figuring it would tell iPhone owners what they really wanted to know :
They are not going to be able to use Opera Mini any time soon .
Boy , was I wrong .
The discussion has been raging about how Opera came to know that its software was n’t going to be welcomed by Apple .
In particular , iPhone fans wanted to know if the company submitted a fully working version of Opera to the iPhone App Store .
So I went back to Mr. von Tetzchner for more details .
He said that the development of the iPhone browser was more an “ internal project ” of some engineers than a product that management was committed to introducing .
Indeed , development was halted after the company looked at the details of the license agreement in Apple ’s software development kit and realized that it would not be permitted .
“ We stopped the work because of the prohibitive license , ” Mr. von Tetzchner wrote in an e-mail message .
The eagle - eyed Mac blogger John Gruber had wondered whether there was a technical issue because Opera Mini appears to run on Java , which is not available on the iPhone .
But Mr. von
Tetzchner wrote that Opera has a version that runs “ native ” — that is without needing an environment like Java .
I ’m not entirely sure why these questions stirred up the blogosphere so much .
We already know that Apple does reject some applications when they duplicate functions of Apple ’s own software .
Still , the attention , at least in some quarters , to the details of Opera ’s plans for the iPhone highlights some of the stress that Apple has created .
The company is oblique in what it tells developers in advance about what its standards are for the App Store .
As a result , Apple fans and developers look to every little incident and mention of the iPhone for clues about how Apple ’s App store actually works .
John Gruber wrote this very clearly last month :
Here is a complete list of what Apple must do to increase developers ’ trust in the App Store system :
1. State the rules .
Thousands protest Mormon involvement with Prop 8 Andrew McLemore
Published : Saturday November 8 , 2008
Print This Email This SALT LAKE CITY --
More than 2,000 people protested outside the headquarters of the Mormon church Friday night for the organization 's heavy support for Proposition 8 , the Associated Press reported .
The proposal was passed by a thin margin Tuesday and adds an amendment to the California constitution banning gay marriage .
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints encouraged members to donate money and time to aggressively pushing the passage of Proposition 8 .
" Separate church and state , " or " I did n't vote on your marriage , " protesters said as they marched around the headquarters .
Many held signs with messages including " Mormons :
Once persecuted , now persecutors , " " Proud of my two moms " and " Protect traditional marriage .
Ban divorce . "
The measure overturned a California Supreme Court ruling earlier this year that legalized gay marriage within the state , allowing thousands of gay couples to marry .
The fight surrounding the definition of marriage was the most expensive in the country with both sides raising $ 70 million , CBS reported in a video available below .
Although the Mormon church does not officially endorse political leaders or parties , it speaks out on moral issues important to the church 's beliefs .
" With the L.D.S. churchs vast involvement in the passage of Proposition 8 , we are seeing a repeat of a tragic and deplorable history , " a former Salt Lake City mayor , Rocky Anderson , said .
Church officials said they were " disturbed " that the Mormon church is being " singled out for speaking up as part of its democratic right in a free election , " said LDS spokesman Scott Trotter earlier Friday .
Trotter said millions of people of all creeds and backgrounds voted for Proposition 8 that were not being criticized by the gay rights movement .
The African - American community , which saw the election of the first black president Tuesday , voted overwhelmingly for the measure , CBS News reported .
But activists remained livid that the measure was passed and were intent on blaming the Mormon establishment .
" The main focus is going to be going after the Utah brand , " John Aravosis , an influential Washington , D.C. - based blogger , told the Associated Press .
" We 're going to destroy the Utah brand .
It is a hate state . "
Another protest against Proposition 8 drew up to 10,000 in San Diego on Saturday , as gay rights activists hit the streets in a peaceful , 90 - minute demonstration .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
There are only about 1,500 hours to go before Election Day .
And that 's also about how many times you 'll hear snappy sound bites about the economic proposals of John McCain and Barack Obama .
Over the next nine weeks , CNNMoney.com will help you sort through the claims .
We 'll try to sort fact from fiction and truth from exaggeration - or just clue you in on what the candidates are really talking about .
The first part in the series : Just how much tax relief is McCain offering ?
The claim :
To hear Obama tell it , McCain is n't proposing " one penny of tax relief to more than 100 million Americans . "
The Obama campaign says it bases that number on McCain 's proposal to increase the exemption tax filers take for dependents , and adds that it is the " only middle - class tax cut " the Republican nominee has offered .
The top line :
It depends on what you mean by tax relief and what you mean by " only . "
But Obama 's claim is n't as far - fetched as it sounds , keeping in mind that projections about tax effects are not carved in stone .
The facts : McCain has made several tax proposals .
One of them is the dependent exemption increase .
Obama gets to his " more than 100 million " charge primarily from an analysis that two Harvard researchers did for the campaign .
They examined 2004 tax return data from the IRS and estimated that 101 million tax returns would not benefit from the increase to the exemption in 2009 .
That represents more than 140 million people .
The Obama campaign claims that number is actually low because the data did not include non-filers .
The Tax Foundation , a group unaffiliated with the Obama campaign , reached a similar conclusion .
So which Americans would see no benefit from McCain 's proposal ?
People without dependents , of course , and those who do n't make enough money to file or to owe enough federal income tax to benefit fully from the exemption .
At the same time , the Obama camp is pushing it when it claims that the exemption increase is the " only " middle class tax break McCain offers .
Douglas Holtz - Eakin , McCain 's senior economic adviser , said some of the folks who do n't get a break from the dependent exemption could benefit from McCain 's proposal to change how money spent on health insurance is taxed .
Today , if you buy a policy on your own , you do n't get any tax break .
If your employer subsidizes your premiums , that money is considered tax - free to you .
Under McCain 's plan , that subsidy would become taxable income .
But anyone who buys insurance would receive a refundable tax credit worth $ 2,500 per person ( $ 5,000 per family ) .
That 's a dollar - for - dollar reduction of your tax bill , or , if you do n't have a tax bill , a dollar - for - dollar increase in the amount of money Uncle Sam would send your way .
Certainly , the health care credit would provide a new tax break for anyone who buys insurance on their own .
Whether the credit would be a boon for those who get insurance through their employer depends , among other things , on the cost of their plans , the amount their employer contributes and their income tax rate .
The Tax Policy Center , in a preliminary analysis of McCain 's health plan , said the credits are larger than the current premiums for the most generous group health plans .
So initially it may be a break for many .
But over time , experts say , the value of that credit will go down since it's not likely to keep pace with the rising health care costs .
Holtz - Eakin also said that some of the households without dependents could get tax relief because of McCain 's proposal to permanently " patch " the Alternative Minimum Tax .
The so - called wealth tax , left unaddressed , would hit an increasing number of middle - and upper - middle - income families .
While Congress has been patching the AMT every year , McCain 's proposal would be more of a super - patch .
The Republican nominee has also proposed to make permanent the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts , which would otherwise expire by 2011 .
Even critics of those cuts , however , expect lawmakers to keep many in place .
The bottom line :
It 's not fair to say that McCain 's dependent exemption proposal is his " only middle - class tax cut . "
But Obama 's claim that " more than 100 million Americans " will be left out of tax relief under McCain seems to be in the ballpark .
When the Tax Policy Center , which has analyzed both candidates ' tax plans , considered McCain 's proposals as a whole minus his health care plan , it estimated that 66 million tax " units " - or 78 million people - would still not see tax relief next year .
Add their kids and Cousin Itt upstairs , and you get closer to that 100 million number Obama touts .
But one caveat :
The numbers are expected to fall once researchers incorporate the effects of McCain 's health care credit , which they expect to do in the coming weeks .
AUSTRALIA will avoid a recession next year , one of only a handful of developed countries whose economy will continue to grow , a leading global think tank says .
As financial markets wrestle with the meaning of the latest last - ditch US bail - out - a $ 500 billion prop for the ailing banking giant Citigroup - the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development predicts the richest economies in the world will shrink by a collective 0.4 per cent next year .
" Many OECD economies are in or are on the verge of a protracted recession of a magnitude not experienced since the early 1980s , " the chief economist , Klaus Schmidt - Hebbel , said .

Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama hammered John McCain on the issue of taxes today , while speaking in Dover , NH .
Obama specifically pointed out that McCain ’s healthcare plan would tax workers ’ health insurance benefits .
“ And I can make a firm pledge : under my plan , no family making less than $ 250,000 will see their taxes increase – not your income taxes , not your payroll taxes , not your capital gains taxes , not any of your taxes .
My opponent ca n’t make that pledge , and here ’s why : for the first time in American history , he wants to tax your health benefits Apparently , Senator McCain does n’t think it ’s enough that your health premiums have doubled , he thinks you should have to pay taxes on them too .
That ’s a $ 3.6 trillion tax increase on middle class families .
That will eventually leave tens of millions of you paying higher taxes .
That ’s his idea of change , ” Obama said .
Obama also pointed out that McCain would give tax cuts to people making over $ 2.8 million a year , “ Now I do want to be fair .
Senator McCain is offering some tax cuts .
He ’d spend nearly $ 2 trillion over a decade in tax breaks for corporations .
He would continue the Bush tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans .
His plan gives more than a half million dollars in tax cuts for households making over $ 2.8 million .
That ’s right – $ 2.8 million .
Now I know that Senator McCain has said that only those making over $ 5 million a year are rich , so maybe he thinks that folks making $ 2.8 million are middle class . ”

The reality is that the McCain healthcare plan is a privatization plan .
Currently , employers receive a tax credit for offering health insurance , but McCain wants to eliminate that credit , so that employers stop offering health insurance , and people have to buy their own .
Not only would you have to purchase your own insurance , but you would have to pay taxes on the premiums .
This is McCain ’s idea of healthcare reform .
McCain ’s plan would actually lead to more people losing their health insurance .
His plan does offer a tax credit , which people qualify for after they buy the policy .
If you ca n’t afford the policy , you do n’t get the tax credit , which means that millions more Americans would have no health insurance .
These are the types of issues that Obama needs to hit home everyday to expose the real John McCain , not the guy who is hiding behind Sarah Palin .
Minneapolis
In a government warehouse in the northeast part of this city , the recount of the Senate race between GOP Sen .
Norm Coleman and Democrat Al Franken is orderly and transparent .
Teams of workers sort paper optical - scan ballots as campaign representatives look on .
Minneapolis election director Cindy Reichert allows outsiders almost to lean over the shoulders of the counters and observe their work .
At least here , everyone is " Minnesota nice . "
That ...
The Words They Used
The words that speakers used at the two political conventions show the themes that the parties have highlighted .
Republican speakers have talked about reform and character far more frequently than the Democrats .
And Republicans were more likely to talk about businesses and taxes , while Democrats were more likely to mention jobs or the economy .
Opinion
Economy has fared better under Dem presidents
Most Americans have one eye on the nation 's financial crises and the other on the presidential election .
And they are asking themselves , " Is John McCain or Barack Obama , the Democrats or the Republicans , better for the economic health of the country as well as for my own financial well - being ? "
That is the defining question of this election .
A businessman who voted for George Bush twice , and Bill Clinton in ' 96 , told me , " Barack Obama sounds really impressive , and I have to admit that the goals of his social programs - particularly health care , education and the environment - seem good .
But I 'm worried the Democrats can't manage the economy as well , and they 'll get into my wallet . "
This sentiment is not rare .
In past elections , pollsters have found that many voters believe that the Republicans do better with the economy .
But is it true ?
Let 's look at the record .
During the 20th century , the Dow Jones industrial average rose 7.3 percent per year on average under Republican presidents .
Under Democrats , it rose 10.3 percent - which means that investors gained a whopping 41 percent more .
And the stock market declined further during George Bush 's two terms .
Moreover , according to research from Professor Larry Bartels of Princeton , real middle class wage growth is double when a Democrat is president , contrasted to that growth under a Republican president .
Since World War II , Democratic presidents have increased the national debt by an average of 3.7 percent per year , and Republican presidents have increased it an average of 10.1 percent .
During the same time period , the unemployment rate was , on average , 4.8 percent under Democratic presidents ; it was 6.3 percent under Republicans .
That 's the historical record .
What about economic policies over the past 15 years ?
The Clinton - Gore administration presided over the longest peacetime economic expansion in our history .
The national debt was reduced dramatically , the industrial sector boomed , wages grew and more Americans found jobs .
How has the Bush - Cheney team fared ?
In the past seven years , we have experienced the weakest job creation cycle since the Great Depression , record deficits , record household debt , a record bankruptcy rate and a substantial increase in poverty .
We have gone from being the nation with the biggest budget surplus in history to becoming the nation with the largest deficit in history .
The Bush administration , supported by Republicans on Capitol Hill , pushed through a sweeping tax cut in 2001 , under which the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans reaped 43 percent of the gain .
In less than a year and a half , the federal government 's 10 - year projected budget surplus of $ 1.6 trillion had vanished .
In 2000 , we had a surplus of $ 236 billion .
In 2004 , we had a deficit of $ 413 billion .
This dramatic reversal is the direct consequence of Bush 's tax cuts - and McCain wants to pursue the same bankrupt policies .
Since the conventions , McCain and his surrogates have been pounding away at the Democrats , labeling them as the " tax and spend " party .
Yet recent research has shown that more than 70 percent of our national debt was created by just three Republican presidents : Reagan and the two Bushes .
There 's an old expression in Las Vegas , " Figures do n't lie and liars figure . "
By E. J. Dionne - November 3 , 2008
WASHINGTON --
A good politician triumphs by adapting to the times and taking advantage of opportunities as they come .
A great politician anticipates openings others do n't see and creates possibilities that were not there before .
John McCain might have been the second kind of politician , tried to be the first , and enters Election Day at a steep disadvantage .
Barack Obama certainly seized the opportunities created by President Bush 's failures and the country 's profound discontent , which only deepened after the economic crash .
But by creating a new social movement , new forms of political organization , and a sense of excitement and possibility not felt in politics for three decades , he bids to become one of the country 's most consequential leaders .
McCain began with a triumphant primary comeback and then adapted too much to the wishes of a discredited party .
He turned his campaign into a conventional enterprise that defined its candidate down .
In the spring , Democrats feared that Republicans had stumbled upon the one foe who might weather the powerful tide of dissatisfaction .
They worried that this independent - minded war hero could fully separate himself from Bush and run as a sufficient break from the status quo .
In state after state during the primaries , McCain drew heavily on the votes of independents , moderates and Republicans who were unhappy with Bush .
But instead of carrying on as the un-Bush who defied conservative orthodoxy , McCain embraced the right for fear of losing it .
He chose Sarah Palin as his running mate , which finally earned him cries of approval from the right but sent moderate voters scurrying Obama 's way .
And as the campaign closed , the McCain tragedy became a farce starring Joe the Plumber and casting Obama as a socialist with a radical bunch of friends .
McCain was left hoping that a hidden cadre of voters who fear an Obama victory would save him by defying the pollsters .
McCain 's default allowed Obama to define the campaign , though Obama 's most important insight came much earlier :
He saw an opening for a young African - American senator with brief Washington experience , realizing that the very unlikeliness of his candidacy would enhance its attractiveness .
He not only gave Americans a chance to lay down the burdens of race .
He invited them to embrace his very newness and thereby move past the 1960s , the ' 80s , the '90s and the Bush era all at once .
" It 's time to turn the page , " Obama would say , and there were many pages Americans wanted to turn .
His post - everything candidacy , wrapped in a powerful rhetoric of hope , was immensely attractive to the young .
They became the happy warriors of campaign manager David Plouffe 's meticulously organized national machine .
It worked its magic in neighborhoods never before blessed with even a precinct captain .
At rallies , Obama heaped praise on his organizers , a natural act of respect from a man tempered by community organizing and disciplined by the rigors of Chicago - style politics .
And he married these old - fashioned skills to high technology : Mayor Daley , meet Bill Gates .
He created a money machine that fueled his organizers and paid for one of the most extensive and focused advertising campaigns in the history of American politics .
He created a brand with a logo and a slogan that barely changed over 21 months .
Obama understood better than any other Democrat that a vast new progressive movement , called into being by antipathy to Bush and outrage over the Iraq War , was waiting for leadership .
Yet Obama knew that the often irate legions of the blogosphere needed to be fused with a soft - spoken center weary of partisanship and division .
It was another unlikely marriage that Obama sanctified .
All this created Obama 's opportunity .
But every campaign offers make - or - break moments of testing , and the key moment this time came on Sept. 24 , the day McCain suspended his campaign and proposed postponing the first presidential debate so the candidates could devote themselves to work on the financial bailout .
Obama quickly rejected McCain 's suggestion , McCain backed down , and Obama established himself as a leader .
When the debate took place two days later , Obama 's calm , deliberate performance confirmed his leadership skills for millions in the ranks of the uncertain .
If any candidate 's recent past stands as a warning against premature obituaries , it is McCain's .
But there seems to be an inexorable quality to Obama 's rise this year because he is the first truly 21st - century figure in American politics .
He is the innovator who has set the standard for the next political era .
Whenever I discussed the current bailout situation with people , I find they have a hard time comprehending the actual numbers involved .
That became a problem while doing the research for the Bailout Nation book .
I needed some way to put this into proper historical perspective .
If we add in the Citi bailout , the total cost now exceeds $ 4.6165 trillion dollars .
People have a hard time conceptualizing very large numbers , so let ’s give this some context .
The current Credit Crisis bailout is now the largest outlay In American history .
Jim Bianco of Bianco Research crunched the inflation adjusted numbers .
The bailout has cost more than all of these big budget government expenditures – combined :
• Marshall Plan : Cost : $ 12.7 billion , Inflation Adjusted Cost : $ 115.3 billion
• Louisiana Purchase : Cost : $ 15 million , Inflation Adjusted Cost : $ 217 billion
• Race to the Moon : Cost : $ 36.4 billion , Inflation Adjusted Cost : $ 237 billion
• S&L Crisis : Cost : $ 153 billion , Inflation Adjusted Cost : $ 256 billion
• Korean War : Cost : $ 54 billion , Inflation Adjusted Cost : $ 454 billion
• The New Deal : Cost : $ 32 billion ( Est ) , Inflation Adjusted Cost : $ 500 billion ( Est )
• Invasion of Iraq : Cost : $ 551 b , Inflation Adjusted Cost : $ 597 billion
• Vietnam War : Cost : $ 111 billion , Inflation Adjusted Cost : $ 698 billion
• NASA : Cost : $ 416.7 billion , Inflation Adjusted Cost : $ 851.2 billion TOTAL : $ 3.92 trillion ______________________________________________________________________

>
That is $ 686 billion less than the cost of the credit crisis thus far .
The only single American event in history that even comes close to matching the cost of the credit crisis is World War II : Original Cost : $ 288 billion , Inflation Adjusted Cost : $ 3.6 trillion
The $ 4.6165 trillion dollars committed so far is about a trillion dollars ( $ 979 billion dollars ) greater than the entire cost of World War II borne by the United States : $ 3.6 trillion , adjusted for inflation ( original cost was $ 288 billion ) .
Go figure : WWII was a relative bargain .
I estimate that by the time we get through 2010 , the final bill may scale up to as much as $ 10 trillion dollars …

UPDATE : November 25 , 23008 10:34am
A few additional details :
- Well regarded Jim Bianco did the number crunching .
The easiest method is to recalculate the numbers using CPI data .
There are other ways to depict this — such as percentage of GDP , or on a per capita basis , or in terms of costs of common items ( eggs , bread , big macs , etc. ) .
Bloomberg calculates the total amount the taxpayer is on the hook for is $ 7.76 trillion , or $ 24,000 for every man woman and child in the country .
( Data breakdown is here )
Regardless , no matter you calculate it , we are talking about an ungodly amount of money .
What would happen if you cross-bred J. R. Ewing of “ Dallas ” and Carl Pope , the head of the Sierra Club ?
You ’d get T. Boone Pickens .
What would happen if you cross - bred Henry Ford and Yitzhak Rabin ?
You ’d get Shai Agassi .
And what would happen if you put together T. Boone Pickens , the green billionaire Texas oilman now obsessed with wind power , and Shai Agassi , the Jewish Henry Ford now obsessed with making Israel the world ’s leader in electric cars ?
You ’d have the start of an energy revolution .
The only good thing to come from soaring oil prices is that they have spurred innovator / investors , successful in other fields , to move into clean energy with a mad - as - hell , can - do ambition to replace oil with renewable power .
Two of the most interesting of these new clean electron wildcatters are Boone and Shai .
Agassi , age 40 , is an Israeli software whiz kid who rose to the senior ranks of the German software giant SAP .
He gave it all up in 2007 to help make Israel a model of how an entire country can get off gasoline and onto electric cars .
He figured no country has a bigger interest in diminishing the value of Middle Eastern oil than Israel .
On a visit to Israel in May , I took a spin in a parking lot on the Tel Aviv beachfront in Agassi ’s prototype electric car , while his sister watched out for the cops because it is not yet licensed for Israeli roads .
Agassi ’s plan , backed by Israel ’s government , is to create a complete electric car “ system ” that will work much like a mobile - phone service “ system , ” only customers sign up for so many monthly miles , instead of minutes .
Every subscriber will get a car , a battery and access to a national network of recharging outlets all across Israel  as well as garages that will swap your dead battery for a fresh one whenever needed .
Microsoft researchers define Cyberchondria as : " the unfounded escalation of concerns about common symptomatology , based on the review of search results and literature on the Web . "
Read their report here .
The researchers point out that the Web , including sites like WebMD , offers a ton of great info that can turn those of us who do n't play doctors on TV or in real life into pretty handy self - diagnosers .
The problem is that people tend to get more and more anxious as they get ahold of more and more details about their possible maladies .
Microsoft researchers surveyed 515 people 's health - related searches as the basis for their study and paid particular attention to how searches about common , pretty harmless issues can lead people to delve into symptoms for more serious issues that they less likely are afflicted by .
For example , those suffering from headaches or breathlessness can suddenly find themselves sweating it out about brain tumors or heart attacks when they might merely have a minor allergic reaction .
And these are mostly people who would n't consider themselves hypochondriacs , according to the survey .
Then of course there 's the post - search hangover issue : Searches feeling anxiety over whatever they were searching .
This month marks the 10th anniversary of the first launched module of the International Space Station ( ISS ) .
The module Zarya was lifted into orbit on November 20th , 1998 by a Russian Proton rocket lifting off from Baikonur , Kazhakstan .
In the decade since , 44 manned flights and 34 unmanned flights have carried further modules , solar arrays , support equipment , supplies and a total of 167 human beings from 15 countries to the ISS , and it still has a ways to go until it is done .
Originally planned to be complete in 2003 , the target date for completion is now 2011 .
Aside from time spent on construction , ISS crew members work on a good deal of research involving biology and physics in conditions of microgravity .
If humans are ever to leave the Earth for extended periods , the ISS is designed to be the place where we will discover the best materials , procedures and safety measures to make it a reality .

“ There ’s this ‘ Alice in Wonderland ’ quality to the question of , what is the public interest here and who ’s protecting it ? ” said Mr. Brodsky , who conducted a hearing on the issue of public financing of sports stadiums this summer .
“ We ca n’t find the money for the M.T.A. , or schools , or hospitals , and these folks are used to the perks and good things of life , and expect them . ”
The city maintains it was simply trying to obtain a luxury suite comparable to that given to other cities involved in stadium or arena projects .
But the message traffic , which dates to January 2006 , raises questions , too , about how sincere city officials were when they recently stated publicly that the box could be used to reward outstanding city workers , rather than mainly for the mayor , dignitaries and aides .
The notion of inviting city workers as guests is not mentioned in the e-mail messages until Aug.
7 , 2008 , and only then in response to an inquiry from a reporter .
The city ’s push for the perks has been known , at least broadly speaking , since Mr. Brodsky began raising questions earlier this year about the stadium deals for the Yankees and Mets , from whom the city also secured a luxury box .
But the e-mail messages offer a revealing snapshot of the behavior and marching orders of the people involved in the deal for the construction of the billion - dollar Yankee Stadium .
It is hard to determine the precise value of what the city gave the Yankees as part of the exchange .
The public parking , though perhaps a convenience to those who drive to the stadium , was to be run by a parking garage operator , not the city , before it was turned over to the Yankees for team use .
The billboards would most likely generate about $ 750,000 annually , given their location .
The Yankees are expected to charge $ 600,000 to $ 850,000 a year for stadium luxury suites , according to reports .
The project required permission from the Internal Revenue Service because of the team ’s desire to use tax - exempt bonds to finance construction .
In one heated exchange , city lawyers threatened they would not make the request to the I.R.S. for the use of the tax - exempt financing unless the Yankees would consider providing the luxury suite .
Judge uses host as an example of what happens when you defy the state

Monday , Nov 17 , 2008
A Libertarian radio host and political activist has been sentenced to 100 days in prison for refusing to remove a couch from his back yard .
Furthermore , the trial was held behind closed doors after the judge ordered proceedings moved to a private room away from spectators .
The reason ?
The defendant took a full six seconds to sit down .
Ian “ Freeman ” Bernard , presenter of the nationally syndicated libertarian show Free Talk Live , was taken into custody and received a thirty day jail term for contempt of court last Friday .
When details of the closed hearing later emerged , Freeman had received another two thirty day sentences and a further ten day term for refusing to pay a fine and remove the couch in his yard .
In the video below , note how Freeman begins to sit down along with everyone else in the room , but as the judge calls his name he pauses and seems confused about whether he is supposed to stand to attention or sit down .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
The original charge came about earlier this year when a housing inspector visited Freeman ’s property in Keene , New Hampshire , following up a complaint , and cited him for having a couch in the yard .
Freeman managed to capture the incident on camera :
Freeman questioned the charge and agreed to remove the offending piece of furniture as long as he could speak with the person that made the complaint .
This request was refused and the matter went to trial .
The Lew Rockwell Blog notes that the trial was used as a showpiece to send a message to activists like Freeman and his supporters .
There is a backstory to all of this .
The local despots have been keeping a close eye on the activists , no doubt reading the web forums and keeping informed of their plans for peaceful noncompliance and civil disobedience .
Thus , this entire court appearance was planned and executed swiftly .
Local activists did recently make some headway into getting the court to allow the panning of video cameras in the court .
As a listener of the show , I believe that another reason why Bernard was moved to an alternate courtroom was to prevent video of this from getting out .
Also note that in the video , when the courtroom is ordered to all rise , the bailiff takes a long look at everyone else to make sure they are complying with the order .
This is because everyone in attendance was threatened with arrest beforehand should they defy the judge as a form of protest .
The Free Keene blog , which bills itself as an outlet for “ liberty minded activists ” , has more on this .
“ It was oppressive , ” said Dale Everett , 40 , of Keene .
“ They had a notice posted obviously targeting us , liberty activists , saying that anyone who did n’t stand for the judge would be ’ subject to sanction . ’
So I left .
I was n’t prepared to get arrested today . ”
Another resident commented that the courtroom at Freeman ’s trial was crammed with police “ to try and outnumber the liberty activists . ”

Guest commentary from Mauri Pelto
Changes occurring in marine terminating outlet glaciers of the Greenland Ice Sheet and ice shelves fringing the Antarctic Peninsula have altered our sense of the possible rate of response of large ice sheet - ice shelf systems .
There is a shared mechanism at work that has emerged from the detailed observations of a number of researchers , that is the key to the onset and progression of the ice retreat .
This mechanism is shared despite the vastly different nature of the environments of Jakobshavns Isbrae , Wilkins Ice Shelf and the Petermann Glacier .
We reviewed in a previous post the first mechanism for explaining the change in velocity of Greenland ’s large outlet glacier – the Zwally effect – and why it is not the key .
This mechanism relies on meltwater reaching the glacier base via moulins and reducing the friction at the base of the glacier .
This idea was observed to be the cause of a brief seasonal acceleration of 10 - 20 % on the Jakobshavns Glacier in 1998 and 1999 at Swiss Camp 35 km inland from the calving front ( Zwally et al. , 2002 ) .
Examination of recent rapid supraglacial ( i.e. on the surface ) lake drainage documented short term velocity changes due to such events around 10 % , but little significance to the annual flow of the large glaciers outlet glaciers ( Das et.al , 2008 ) .
The second mechanism is a dynamic thinning of the terminus zone of the marine terminating outlet glacier reducing the effective bed pressure , allowing acceleration – the Jakobshavn effect .
The reduced resistive force at the calving front due to the thinner ice , now experiencing greater flotation , is then propagated “ up glacier ” ( Hughes , 1986 ; Thomas , 2003 and 2004 ) .
If the Jakobshavn effect is the key the velocity increase will propagate up - glacier , there will be no seasonal cycle , and thinning and acceleration would be greatest near the terminus .
That the thinning and acceleration is greatest for marine terminating outlet glaciers has indeed been demonstrated by Sole et. al. ( 2008 ) .
That acceleration began at the calving front and spread upglacier 20 km in 1997 and up to 55 km inland by 2003 ( Joughin et al. , 2004 ) .
On Helheim the thinning and velocity propagated up - glacier from the calving front .
Each of the glaciers fronts did respond to tidal variations indicating they had started floating , detached from their bed ( Hamilton et al , 2006 ) .
This summer , Jason Box and others at Ohio State University observed that Jakobhavns Isbrae retreated again , losing 15 km2 , and maintaining an accelerated pace from the northern branch of the ice stream as opposed to the greater retreat and acceleration of the southern branch 2001 - 2005 ( Box , 2008 ) .
This was accompanied by the second consecutive year of substantial retreat of the glacier just north of Jakobshavn , Sermeq Avannarleq which had been quite stable for much of the last century ( Box , 2008 b ) .
Sole et. al. ( 2008 ) also noted that the recent thinning and acceleration was not limited to just the now more famous Helheim , Jakobshavn and Kangderlugssuaq Glaciers , but included Rinks Isbrae , Equaluit , Cristian IV and all others they observed .
Note the greater flow of the southern ice stream in 2000 , compare to the northern ice stream in this image from Ian Joughin :
Petermann Glacier is a much different glacier than the others mentioned above .
Its velocity of 2 - 3 m / day ( Higgins , 1990 ) is much lower than 10 - 30 m / day observed on the other marine terminating outlet glaciers .
It is located on the northwest corner of Greenland and certainly experiences less melting and less snowfall .
The lower 80 km ( in length ) and 1300 km2 ( in area ) of the glacier is afloat .
This makes it ( by area ) the largest floating glacier in the Northern Hemisphere .
The ice front is not impressive , unlike the faster outlet glaciers .
The calving front protrudes a mere 5 - 10 m above sea level , reflecting the fact that the ice at the front is only 60 - 70 m thick .
Further up - glacier , the ice at the grounding line is 600 - 700 m thick .
The combination of velocity and thickness yield the volume of material calved each year .
Petermann Glacier calves 0.6 km3 ( Higgins , 1990 ) , whereas Jakobshavns yields close to 40 km3 .
The thinning between the grounding line and the calving front is mainly via melting as the snowline is at 900 m .
The low slope leads to very low velocities , giving the low - lying floating section plenty of time to melt , and surface melt ponds are common .
The Petermann Glacier lost a substantial area , 29 km2 due to calving this summer ( Box 2008 c ) , and a crack well back of the calving front indicates another 150 km2 is in danger .
The volume of the ice lost is much less than that from the loss of a comparable area by Jakobshavn because the ice is an order of magnitude thinner .
Once again the key to this glacier ’s second major ice loss this decade after limited retreat in the last century , is thinning of the floating tongue , which weakens the glacier .
The loss of this ice should then lead to acceleration , developing more crevassing and glacier retreat .
The crack seen in the image of Petermann Glacier ( ASTER image provided by Ian Howat of Ohio State ) is more of a rift , like those on Larsen Ice Shelf , than a crevasse .
This transverse rift is further connected to longitudinal - marginal rifts .
Illustrating the poor connection of the Petermann Glacier to its margin and lack of a stabilizing force this margin has , even 15 km behind the calving front .
This is not the only rift of its kind on the glacier .
Also note that like on Larsen Ice Shelf the rift crosscuts surface streams .
A series of Landsat images from 2002 , 2006 and 2007 illustrate the shift in the terminus and in the position of key rifts A , B and C .
The distance back from the terminus has diminished for A and B from 2002 to 2007 .
In 2006 to 2007 the shift in the position of C is also evident .
As in the case on Jakobshavns , Helheim and others the key is the pre-conditioning phase of thinning , that leads to more calving , that leads to more acceleration , and that generates retreat .
In a recent paper in press in the Journal of Glaciology Ian Howat and others examined changes in terminus position , surface elevation and flow on 32 glaciers along the southeast coast of Greenland from 200- 2006 .
Their key conclusion was that the
… ratio of retreat to the along - flow stress - coupling length is proportional to the relative increase in speed , consistent with typical ice flow and sliding laws .
This affirms that speedup results from loss of resistive stress at the front during retreat , which leads to along - flow stress transfer .
Many retreats began with an increase in thinning rates near the front in the summer of 2003 , a year of record high coastal - air and sea-surface temperatures .
This indicates again the importance of pre-conditioned thinning via melting .
Wilkins Ice Shelf ( WIS ) refused to hibernate this winter .
A previous post noted that the recent collapse of Wordie Ice Shelf , Mueller Ice Shelf , Jones Ice Shelf , Larsen - A and Larsen - B Ice Shelf on the Antarctic Peninsula has made us aware of how dynamic ice shelf systems are .
The reasons for Ice Shelf collapse continue to be identified , but one key thread emerges .
The decade prior to collapse the Larsen - B Ice Shelf had thinned primarily by melting of the ice shelf bottom ( by the ocean ) by 18 m ( Shepard and others , 2003 ) .
Thinning preconditions the ice shelf for failure by weakening its connection to pinning points at the grounding line as the shelf becomes more buoyant .
Glasser and Scambos ( 2008 ) observed that prior to collapse that rifts and crevasses parallel to the ice front crosscut the meltwater channels and ponds , hence , post dated them .
The number and length of the rifts increased markedly in the year before collapse .
There was no evidence of relict rifts , illustrating that these rifts are a feature of the last 20 years .
After ice shelf collapse the ice front receded to the pre-existing rifts , and the pre-existing rifts defined the area of collapse .
In this case the thinning and resultant structural weaknesses preconditioned the ice to rapid breakup , which proceeded to lose only the preconditioned portion of the ice shelf .
The WIS is buttressed by Alexander , Latady , Charcot and Rothschild islands and by numerous small ice rises , indicating that they are touching the ocean floor .
WIS was examined by Braun , Humbert and Moll ( 2008 ) .
They found that drainage of melt ponds into crevasses were of no relevance for the break - up at WIS .
On WIS the evolution of failure zones is associated with ice rises .
In 1993 / 94 , rift formation started to expand at the northern ice front .
Today , the central part of WIS is intersected by long rifts formed in and around ice rises .
The rifts up to tens of kilometers long evolve and coalesce prior to break - up events .
The conclusion for WIS is that preconditioning of the ice shelf by connection of the rifts in the failure zones near ice rises trigger break - up events .
The thinning and rifting lead to a cascade of failure .
The Feb . - April break - up left a narrow 6 km wide fractured connection to Charcot Island .
Existing rifts formed between already existing fractures , crossed almost the entire northern shelf .
This fragile and vulnerable area was expected to collapse further the next austral summer .
However , it instead has happened this austral winter with loss of an additional 160 km2 of ice .
It is the first winter ice loss of an ice shelf ever observed , and so was surprising .
However , looking at the image below , from the European Space Agency showing the extent of the rifts as winter began , makes this less surprising .
The question is more what can possibly hold this together ?
The area of interconnected rifts seen is 2000 km2 .
If this is lost an additional 3000 km2 of the 13 000 k m2 of WIS , is at risk when this connection to Charcot Island is lost ( Braun , Humbert and Moll , 2008 ) .
It appears then that glacier or ice shelf thinning is the key preconditioning factor for collapse , retreat and acceleration , whether you are in Antarctica of Greenland .
The mechanisms for ice shelf thinning include basal melting ( from warming ocean waters ) , surface melting , reduction in glacier inflow and rift development .
These are interrelated mechanisms that precondition the ice shelves to collapse .
On marine terminating outlet glaciers the mechanisms to trigger thinning is surface ablation causing thinning , and potentially basal melting , though not yet observed ( though see this recent paper by Holland et al , 2008 ) .
Once the process begins thinner less buttressed ice enables acceleration and more calving and more retreat .
There is a potential difference between the two , in glacier such as most marine terminating outlet glaciers , where the glacier flow is rapid , acceleration results from retreat and thinning .
In the case of ice shelves a glacier buttressed by them will accelerate after the loss , but the slow moving ice shelf may suffer from reduced inflow .
Attention will continue to be focused on these rapid responders to climate change ; marine terminating glaciers in Greenland and ice shelves in Antarctica .
We can look forward to more details from the extensive 2008 summer field season in Greenland and the upcoming view of the Wilkins this fall .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Microsoft Corp Chief Executive Steve Ballmer said a Web search advertising deal with Yahoo Inc makes economic sense and may still be possible , though the two sides are not in any discussions .

Shares of Yahoo jumped as much as 17 percent as investors hoped Ballmer ’s comments could lead to the two sides returning to the negotiating table .
But gains were pared back to about 12 percent after Microsoft issued a statement saying it had no interest in buying Yahoo .
Talks between the two broke off in July after Yahoo rejected Microsoft ’s proposal to buy its search advertising business and enact a revenue - sharing partnership .
Yahoo had also rebuffed in May a full acquisition bid from Microsoft that was priced at $ 33 per share , or $ 47.5 billion .
Instead , Yahoo signed a search advertising pact with Web leader Google Inc , which is being scrutinized by regulators .
“ Perhaps there will continue to remain opportunities to partner around search , ” Ballmer told a Gartner Inc conference in Orlando , Florida .
“ We are not in any discussions with them .
We ’ll see .
They want to remain independent .
There are probably still opportunities around search .
I think it would still make sense economically for their shareholders and ours . ”
Since talks broke off , Yahoo shares have plunged to a 5 - 1/ 2 - year low of $ 11.37 , weighed by concerns over the outlook for Web display advertising , as major advertisers such as banks and automakers cut back spending .
“ We offered 33 bucks not too long ago and it ’s 11 and a half .
So I do n’t know what price might have got the job done , ” Ballmer said , responding to a question from Gartner analyst David Smith on whether Microsoft might take another stab at buying Yahoo now that its stock price is so low .
“ It ’s clear that Yahoo did not want to sell the company .
It did not want to sell when we offered 33 ...
They probably think it ’s worth at least 33 today . ”
Yahoo declined comment .
Its shares rose to as high as $ 13.73 on Thursday , before settling at around $ 13.16 in late trading on the Nasdaq .
“ Our position has n’t changed .
Microsoft has no interest in acquiring Yahoo ; there are no discussions between the companies , ” a spokesman for Microsoft said in a statement .
Microsoft shares were up 3.6 percent at $ 23.48 .
Despite the market ’s excitement , any pursuit of new talks would be impeded by several issues , including Yahoo ’s severely depressed stock price and the poor outlook for the advertising market due to the weak economy , analysts said .
“ The larger issue is strategic fit , ” Cross Research analyst Richard Williams said .
“ Microsoft clearly has spent money and changed its focus to ‘ build ’ rather than ‘ buy . ’
He added that for businesses driven by advertising , such as Microsoft and Yahoo ’s Internet operations , it is the wrong time for a deal with markets reeling and consumer confidence plummeting .
“ Going into a recession is about the worst time to buy an advertising firm , ” Williams said .
“ It ’s hard to know how hard they are going to be hit and how low they are going to go . ”

Over in crazy land , also known as the National Review , Kathryn Jean Lopez says that many readers are suggesting that as Obama is saying the debates will go on …
they ’d like McCain to just offer Palin step in for him .
I ’d like to go on record as being in favor of that .
What are these people thinking ?
Either I ’m crazy , or they are – and I ’m hoping it ’s them .
( H/t Andrew Sullivan . )
My guess is that the McCain campaign is ( 1 ) seeing a rapid change in the polls and trying to take some momentum back ; and ( 2 ) wants to postpone the Vice Presidential debate because Palin is n’t ready ( as Republicans have acknowledged recently ) .
The Vice Presidential debate is scheduled for next Thursday .

“ This is the most mindless , ignorant , uninformed comment that we have seen from Governor Palin so far , and there ’s been a lot of competition for that prize . ”
– Richard Wolfe , Newsweek
Sarah Palin yesterday mocked – yes , mocked – fruit fly research .
In a speech about autism and disabilities , Palin had the audacity to mock “ fruit fly research ” as wasteful pork .
Yes she did .
She thinks it ’s pork because , to her , it has a funny name .
Funny , because she ’s a blithering idiot who apparently never attended high school .
Now , anyone who has ever studied any science IN HIGH SCHOOL knows full well that fruit fly research is one of the underpinnings of all modern biology .
She is a freaking idiot .
Here is what Palin had to say , then I ’ll quote a science blog that brought this to my attention :
This is a matter of how we prioritize the money that we spend .
We ’ve got a three trillion dollar budget , and Congress spends some 18 billion dollars a year on earmarks for political pet projects .
That ’s more than the shortfall to fully fund the IDEA .
And where does a lot of that earmark money end up ?
It goes to projects having little or nothing to do with the public good — things like fruit fly research in Paris , France …
And here is what science blog BiochemicalSoul.com had to say :
The fruit fly ( Drosophila ) has probably been the single most important organism for the study of genetics for over a century now .
Almost everything we know about genetics , development , cell biology , neuroscience , and every other field of biology has strong roots in previous and current work on Drosophila .
The fruit fly is one of a small handful of “ standard model organisms ” used by thousands of scientists across the world to learn how our bodies , organs , genes , and proteins work .
Most of what we know about how a single fertilized cell becomes the amazingly complex beings we are comes from studies initially done in Drosophila .
Vast amounts of our understanding of the brain ( and brain disorders , diseases , and defects ) also come from initial studies in fruit flies .
In fact , recent research from my own graduate alma mater , the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill , on fruit fly brains has had an impact on the understanding of autism and has boosted autism research : “ [ S ] cientists at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Medicine have shown that a protein called neurexin is required for .. nerve cell connections to form and function correctly .
The discovery , made in Drosophila fruit flies may lead to advances in understanding autism spectrum disorders , as recently , human neurexins have been identified as a genetic risk factor for autism . ”
To decry research in [ condescending and amazed tone ] “ the fruit fly ” is a testament to the true idiocy of this woman and to the failure of our public education system .
In fact , her own father , Chuck Heath , was a biology teacher – obviously a complete failure of a biology teacher .
Keith Olbermann is all over this .
Republicans do n’t respect science .
It ’s one more example of the intellect , of the brain .
Modern Republicans respect stupidity and ignorance .
That is when , they ’re not respecting hatred and intolerance .
MUMBAI ( Reuters ) - Gunmen killed at least 80 people in a series of attacks in India ’s financial capital Mumbai and troops began moving into two five - star hotels on Thursday where Western hostages were being held , local television said .
Police said they had shot dead four gunmen and arrested nine suspects .
However , the chief minister of Maharashtra state said the situation was not yet contained .
“ The situation is still not under control and we are trying to flush out any more terrorists hiding inside the two hotels , ” Vilasrao Deshmukh , Maharashtra ’s chief minister , told a news conference .
Gunfire and explosions were heard at the landmark Taj Mahal hotel and thick plumes of smoke rose from the building , witnesses said .
There were also explosions at the Oberoi hotel and firing at a hospital where gunmen were surrounded .
“ The terrorists are throwing grenades at us from the rooftop of the Taj and trying to stop us from moving in , ” Ashok Patil , a police inspector told Reuters .
Police said at least 250 people were wounded in the attacks which also targeted a railway station and the Cafe Leopold , perhaps the most famous restaurant and hang - out for tourists in the city .
An organization calling itself the Deccan Mujahideen said it was behind the attacks , television channels said .
The previously little known group sent an email to news organizations claiming responsibility .
“ THEY HAD BOMBS ”
“ I guess they were after foreigners , because they were asking for British or American passports , ” said Rakesh Patel , a British witness who lives in Hong Kong and was staying at the Taj Mahal hotel on business .
“ They had bombs . ”
“ They came from the restaurant and took us up the stairs , ” he told the NDTV news channel , smoke stains covering his face .
“ Young boys , maybe 20 years old , 25 years old .
They had two guns . ”
India has suffered a wave of bomb attacks in recent years .
Most have been blamed on Islamist militants , although police have also arrested suspected Hindu extremists thought to be behind some of the attacks .
The latest attack , apparently aimed at least partly at prosperous Western tourists , is bound to spook investors in one of Asia ’s largest and fastest - growing economies .
Hemant Karkare , the chief of the police anti-terrorist squad in Mumbai , was killed during the attacks , police said .
“ We have shot dead four terrorists and managed to arrest nine suspected terrorists , ” P.D. Ghadge , a police officer at Mumbai ’s central control room , told Reuters .
Japan ’s Foreign Ministry said one of its nationals was killed in the Mumbai attacks and one injured .

TRAPPED HOTEL GUESTS
Mark Abell , a British lawyer , said he had locked himself inside his Oberoi hotel room after hearing two explosions .
Several hundred people had been evacuated from the Taj hotel , one witness said , but many more remained inside , some calling for help from the fifth floor .
Firefighters broke windows to reach trapped guests .
“ We came down the fire exit , but I think they took some more people , they are trying to get to the roof , ” one foreigner told local television .
“ I think about 15 people ( have been taken hostage ) , about half of them are foreigners .. ”
In Washington , the White House and U.S. President - elect Barack Obama condemned the attacks , as did France , current president of the European Union , and United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon .

Indian Home Minister Shivraj Patil said there were around four or five attackers in each of the two hotels .
“ They have attacked hotels , they have attacked the hospitals , they have attacked the railway station , ” he said .
KOREANS , EUROPEANS CAUGHT UP IN ATTACKS
A driver told Reuters at least 50 Koreans were stuck inside the Taj with their drivers waiting outside .
“ We were just getting ready to pick them up , when we heard the first blast , police did not let us get past and they ( the Koreans ) are not answering the phones , ” Deepak Aswar , the driver said .
Europeans were also caught up in the attacks .
“ I was in the restaurant inside Oberoi and I saw this series of gunshots and death which I do n’t want to see again , ” a Spaniard who declined to give his name told Reuters .
“ I crawled out into the kitchen and waited there , until I sensed it was all quiet and seemed over . ”
Maharashtra state police chief A.N. Roy said attackers had fired automatic weapons indiscriminately , and used grenades , adding that they were still holed up in some buildings .
Most kids go trick - or - treating with visions of Snickers bars , Skittles and Kit Kats in their heads .
But when Lars and Shelly Brosdahl 's 7 - year - old son dumped out his Halloween loot Friday , they found something much less sweet : a bag of cash and methamphetamine .
The Brosdahls ' Ramsey neighborhood was packed with kids and parents , and nobody noticed when someone who looked like a teenager dropped something in the 7 - year - old 's bag as he followed his big sister up to a door .
When the boy , dressed as a ghoulish skateboarder , poured out his candy stash later , his 9 - year - old sister , in pirate garb , noticed he had a $ 20 bill .
It was in a wad in a plastic baggie .
" I looked at it and said , ' This is $ 85 , ' " Lars Brosdahl said Monday .
The bag also had some clear crystals that looked like rock candy , he said .
" We assumed it was drugs , " he said .
Police later confirmed the stuff was 2.2 grams of methamphetamine , worth up to $ 200 in street value .
" The [ kids ] could have OD'd on it .
That 's what made me so shaky and upset , '' Shelly Brosdahl said .
The Brosdahls asked that their children 's names not be used .
When the couple asked their son about it , he recalled the costumed teen with the candy .
" He said some bigger kid ran by him and asked if he wanted some candy .
He said , ' Sure , ' and the kid dropped it into his bag , " Lars Brosdahl said .
About that time , Ramsey police were searching the neighborhood on foot for a 24 - year - old man who had fled a nearby apartment after his male roommate called police about being assaulted by the roommate .
Officials can't link the meth to the 24 - year - old , but surmise he was spooked by seeing cops .
" Who else would dump it ? " said Capt .
Tim Dwyer .
He said the 24 - year - old was arrested about 7:45 on Halloween night , about 30 minutes after the call to police .
Officers spotted the man on the phone at Bill 's Superette on Alpine Street and Hwy .

An assault charge against the man is expected .

Two new Suffolk University polls of Ohio and Missouri released today show Barack Obama leading John McCain 51 % - 42 % in Ohio , and the race statistically tied in Missouri , where McCain holds a 46 % - 45 % lead .
Interestingly , Joe the Plumber is now famous , but providing little help to McCain with voters .
John McCain has a big enthusiasm problem in Ohio .
Only , 49 % of those surveyed were casting their voters because of John McCain himself .
Fifteen percent were voting for McCain as a vote against Obama , and 8 % were voting for McCain because of Sarah Palin .
In contrast 71 % of Obama supporters were voting for the ticket because of the candidate .
Ten percent were casting a vote against John McCain , and 12 % will be voting against President Bush .
There are two interesting points here .
Obama ’s economic message seems to have generated enthusiasm in Ohio , and John McCain is still saddled with George W. Bush .
The enthusiasm gap is similar , but not as significant in Missouri .
Sixty six percent of voters say that they will vote Republican because of McCain compared to 73 % who will vote Democratic because of Obama .
However , Sarah Palin has had little or no impact in Missouri , as only 4 % of those surveyed said that they will be voting for McCain because of her .
Twenty one percent of McCain supporters said that they are voting against Obama , while 14 % of Obama supporters see their votes as a vote against President Bush .

Lastly Joe the Plumber has certainly gained his 15 minutes of fame , but he has n’t helped McCain at all in Ohio and Missouri .
Sixty eight percent of respondents in Ohio recognized Joe the Plumber , but only 6 % said that his story made them more likely to vote for McCain , and 4 % said that he made them more likely to vote for Obama .
Eight five percent of those asked said that their support was not affected by Joe the Plumber .
In Missouri , 80 % had heard of Joe .
Eight percent were more likely to vote McCain , and 3 % were more likely to vote Obama , with 86 % unchanged .
I think the point is that a candidate ca n’t substitute negative campaigning and gimmicks such as Joe the Plumber for ideas and issues .
It is not much of a surprise that Obama would have a bigger lead in a state like Ohio , which has been hit hard by the economy .
I think Missouri and Ohio are very close races , and if Obama wins either one of these , on election night , it could signal that the rout is on .
My guess is that Ohio will tip to Obama , and Missouri will go with McCain in a squeaker .
I doubt that either candidate will win both states .
Poll Results
Recently the PC - BSD team released their latest stable version ( PC - BSD 7 ) code - named Fibonacci Edition .
Some of major changes from the previous version include a newer kernel , an experimental ZFS module , and a KDE 4 for desktop environment .
Being a Linux junkie , I thought of this as a perfect opportunity to venture into the BSD arena .
PC - BSD is a flavor of FreeBSD .
Their official website describes PC - BSD as
a complete desktop operating system , designed with the “ casual ” computer user in mind .
This version is an effort to make the BSD Unix more accessible to newcomers , especially those who are switching from Windows or OS X .
Installation :
I decided to install PC - BSD 7 on two different computers , an old laptop ( test machine ) and a fairly powerful desktop ( my workstation ) .
PC - BSD is currently available only in a 32 - bit version .
But the install image is available for different mediums including CD , DVD , USB etc .
I grabbed the DVD image which had the default packages and some optional components .
The installation starts in the text mode with a menu that provides a list of options .
These include emergency command prompt mode , launching graphical installer , ZFS installer module , etc .
I chose the default installation for the Laptop and the ZFS installation on the desktop .
Once the installation started it transitioned into a GUI installer , which took me through six simple steps :
Launguage Selection .
License Agreement .
Installation System Choices .
You can choose install PC - BSD as a Server OS or a Desktop / Laptop OS .
You are also provided a choice to either do a fresh install or upgrade .
I chose the Desktop / Laptop option .
User Account Setup .
This is the standard user accounts creation step .
You can also choose to do an automatic login for one of the user accounts .
Partition Selection .
PC - BSD chooses 512MB of swap partition by default and the rest is allocated for root (/ ) .
If the choice of file system is ZFS , then PC - BSD will automatically create an additional / boot partition and format it as UFS .
This is because ZFS cannot be used as a boot partition .
The partition selection step will be a smooth breeze if you are installating on a fresh computer with no other Operating System .
However , if you do have another OS and are thinking about doing a multi- boot setup there are two things to watch out for : PC - BSD can only be installed on a Primary Partition .
Lets take a short diversion and learn about hard disk partitions .
When a hard disk is partitioned it can have up to four primary partitions and only one extended partition .
The extended partition can then be sub - divided into as many logical partitions as you want .
Even though we can have up to four primary partitions , the hard disk usually has only one .
Since PC - BSD must be installed on a primary partition , you will need to create an extra primary partition using a thrid - party tool .
GParted Live cd is an excellent and free tool for this job .
If you already have a primary partition , there is a good chance your existing OS already occupies this space .
To create an additional primary partition , you must steal some space from one of the extended partition .
But before you can shrink the extended partition you must first shrink one of the logical partitions and then shrink your extended partition .
This newly available space can then be created into a primary partition .
All of these can be done using the GParted Live CD which has a user - friendly GUI interface .
In this partition selection screen , there is a check box that lets you install the PC - BSD ’s bootloader .
PC - BSD ’s bootloader is notorious for wiping out your existing bootloader .
It is advisable to not install BSD ’s bootloader at this time .
Later , you can add PC - BSD to your grub menu list .
This is covered in detail in a later section .
Additional Package Selection .
PC - BSD installs a set of default packages .
One thing that bothered me was that I was unable to view the default package list .
There are packages such as Firefox 3 , OpenOffice.org , etc. , which you can choose to install in addition to the default packages .
Installation progress screen .
Now sit back and relax while the PC - BSD shoves it packages into your hard disk .
For my desktop , the total installation time was under 20 mins .
Modifying GRUB :
When I installed PC - BSD in my test machine , I let it overwrite my existing bootloader ( grub ) .
During my next boot it showed me an option of pressing F1 for BSD and F2 for Linux , but pressing F2 did nothing .
I was stuck with booting into PC - BSD for a little while .
I eventually restored my GRUB through a rescue live cd ( Mandriva One Live CD ) .
A rescue live cd is highly recommended when you are experimenting with new operating systems .
To add PC - BSD onto my GRUB menu , I booted into my linux OS and ( as root ) modified / boot / grub / menu.lst to add the following lines :
title PCBSD7
root ( hd0,2 )
makeactive
chainloader +1 boot
First Boot :
When I first booted into PC - BSD I was presented with a graphical video configuration utility .
It had a reasonable selection of drivers that included Intel , nVidia , vesa , etc .
My laptop had a ATI Radeon Graphics card and my Desktop had an Intel Graphics card .
Both of them were properly detected , but no matter which resolution I chose , it ended up in a 1024 ×768 screen during the resolution test .
So I decided to skip the configuration , which ironically detected my screen size and chose the appropriate screen resolution ( 1600 ×1050 ) .
I was automatically logged into KDE 4 and the first thing I noticed was how fast it took me to the default desktop .
The sound was configured correctly and it played the KDE login music which took me by surprise .
I know that most linux distributions do not have any issues these days with sounds cards , but I was preparing to do some tweaking to get the sound working on a BSD flavor .
The network was up and running from the get go , but this was n’t too much of a surprise since I had a tethered ethernet connection without a router .
The system tray in the KDE panel was quite useful .
It had volume control , a network status monitor ( which also doubles as the network configuration utility ) , a Monitor Resolution changer and a System Upddate manager .
The look and feel of KDE 4 was nice and polished .
PC - BSD has nicely integrated it ’s administration tools into the KDE environment .
All of the following are accessible form the KDE Control Center .
Add / Remove Software –
This utility is only for adding or
removing programs that were installed using PC - BSD ’s PBI pacakges .

System Manager –
This had the option to switch kernels ( if you have multiple kernles installed on the system ) .
You can also use this to fetch BSD ports
( equivalent of URPMI in Mandriva or emerge in Gentoo ) .

Software Installation & Update
PC - BSD introduces a new type of installtion file with .pbi extension ( Push Button Installer or PC BSD Installer ) .
These are self - contained installers that has all the dependent packages included in them .
This mimics the behavior of the setup.exe or the DMG files in Win XP and Mac OS X respectively .
Double clicking on this file in KDE will launch a graphical installation wizard ( root password is required ) and guide you through the installation of the software .
The programs are installed in the / Programs directory and appropriate links are added to the KDE menu .
More PBI based installation files can be found at
http://pbidir.com.
The system update manager was running when I logged into KDE and it
automatically detected and notified me that an upgrade for Firefox 3 and some other software were available .
When I clicked on the notification bubble , it seamlessly downloaded and installed the updates .
Most people think that this is not a big deal since Windows users and some Linux users ( Mandriva ) already enjoy this convenience .
But being a long time Linux user , I ’ve started seeing this feature in Linux only in the past year and it still has few glitches .
After seeing PC - BSD ’s updating service , I am able to appreciate the effort that went into making PC - BSD a user - friendly
system .
In addition to the PBI type install , the FreeBSD ports are also available .
FreeBSD ports are the equivalent of the urpmi or apt - get in the linux systems .
You can use the port system to automatically download packages and dependencies from mirrors and performs installation .
Since PC - BSD is fully compatible with FreeBSD , any package available for FreeBSD can also be installed in PC - BSD .
This opens up the rich set of BSD repositories for power users .
The PC - BSD Guide has more info on this as well .
Quick tip : Install KPorts , it gives a nice GUI for searching and installing
software using BSD ports .
You can download the file with extension . tbz which is a FreeBSD pre-compiled package .
It can be installed as a
root using : pkg_add kports *.tbz
Browser Plugins
The default installation of PC - BSD includes only Konqueror and unfortunately , does not have the flash plugin installed .
However , when I installed Firefox 3 which was available in the dvd , it came with most of the browser plugins .
It had a swfdec plugin for playing flash and it played videos from youtube very nicely .
The default behavior of swfdec is to replace the flash components with a giant play button .
Clicking on that button loads the flash component .
The default audion and video plugin in Firefox 3 was Xine plugin , but it had trouble playing some of the online trailers in apple.com / trailers .
I have n’t had a chance to try mplayer - plugin , but that might be an alternative to the Xine plugin .
Summary :
I am thoroughly convinced that PC - BSD is the perfect choice for a newcomer to the unix world .
It is very straight forward and it requires very little unix knowledge .
Even though I mentioned a couple of caveats ( eg. Bootloader , Primary partition ) , I doubt a new user who is installing on a fresh system will ever come across these issues .
Even if someone does run into these issues , the solutions provided in this article should give them a starting point .
The PC - BSD has a friendly and helpful community , they have an active forum where you can seek help from fellow PC - BSD users .
The PC - BSD team has worked really hard on this release and the results are impressive .
It is ready to challenge the main stream Operating Systems ( Windows , OS X and Linux ) .
I would encourage new users to try PC - BSD without any doubts .
I would definitely recommend Linux gurus to give this distribution a chance and I promise , you wo n’t be disappointed .

DENVER -- Is Barack Obama prepared to be president ?
No. Neither is John McCain .
I have written about 12 pounds of books on the presidency over the past 22 years , three long studies that focused on the day - to - day work of John F. Kennedy , Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan .
This is the most important thing I learned in doing that , a paragraph at the end of the introduction to " President Kennedy : Profile of Power " :
" John F. Kennedy was one of only 42 men who truly knew what it is like to be president .
He was not prepared for it , but I doubt that anyone ever was or ever will be .
The job is sui generis .
The presidency is an act of faith . "
The Kennedy book was published during the presidency of Bill Clinton , so now 43 men know .
Obama , as I said , is obviously not one of them .
But in praise of his acceptance speech here after winning the Democratic nomination , I did think the senator from Illinois , four years older than Kennedy was when he was inaugurated , showed he had a clue when he said :
" We need a president who can face the threats of the future , not keep grasping at the ideas of the past . "
That is not a particularly graceful or articulate line , but it is the most important fact about being president .
The toughest job in the world is essentially reactive .
The president does not run the country and is not paid by the hour .
He is there to respond to events unanticipated : bizarre attacks on New York City , the blockade of a European city occupied by American troops , the rising of young black men and women against legal segregation , civil wars and genocides in places we never knew existed , the shelling of an American fort off South Carolina by other Americans .
Presidents are alone , facing the unknown .
The job is not about running the country ; it is about leading the nation in unexpected crisis or danger .
No one remembers whether Lincoln balanced the budget .
Obama touched on what we anticipate will be the issues faced by the next president , as McCain will this week : a fading economy and place in the world , terrorism , health care , climate change .
All important , critical , even , but no one knows what will be the issue that defines the next president .
John Kennedy and Richard Nixon debated about defending Quemoy and Matsu , two islands off what we then called " Red China , " but Kennedy 's presidency was defined by surprising events in the Cold War against communism , and by civil rights and a civil war in what was called French Indo - China .
And if you are interested in what being president is like , look at the day 45 years ago , Aug. 28 , 1963 , when Martin Luther King Jr. gave his " I Have a Dream " speech on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial .
That made Kennedy realize that his historical destiny would be to put the government on the side of a minority , no small thing in a democracy of majority rule .
Until that day , Kennedy had never allowed himself to be photographed with King , who was seen , rather suspiciously , as a man of the left .
That day , he invited the black minister to the White House .
Waiting for King to arrive , Kennedy met with the National Security Council and signed off on a plot to depose President Ngo Dinh Diem of South Vietnam , an action that turned that far country into an American military colony -- an action that led to disaster .
That is what it was like to president .
No one , least of all Kennedy , knew .
In the end , we choose a president on our own sense of character and judgment .
In the end , it is not about the candidate ; it is about the character and judgment of the American people .
We decide .
It is a great gamble .
Then , the president 's real job is to bring out the best in us .
Recently , Parliament passed into law some changes to the Copyright Act to account for the modern technological environment .
Some of those changes were good , some bad , and I ’ve blogged about them many times before .
But the most controversial change to the Copyright Act made was the insertion of section 92a , which says , in effect , that ISPs have to have a policy to implement cutting off people ’s Internet if they are accused of repeatedly infringing copyright .
This is the first issue I have ever seen get the entire Internet and IT industry in agreement .
All the participants at the TVNZ / InternetNZ debate last month were asked about this issue .
National ’s Maurice Williamson agreed it was a bad thing and said he did n’t know why he had voted for it .
David Cunliffe , Minister for ICT , said he would set up a meeting between Internet folks and ministers to discuss it .
That meeting happened yesterday and these are my notes from it .
The ministers at the meeting were David Cunliffe and Judith Tizard , who is Associate Minister of Commerce and the responsible minster for copyright .
From the Internet side , there were Keith Davidson of InternetNZ , Rick Shera ( a lawyer who has done a lot of work in this area ) , Ernie Newman of TUANZ , Jamie Baddeley of ISPANZ , Ralph Chivers of the TCF , Paul Matthews of the Computer Society , and yours truly carrying an NZOSS banner .
Also there were officials from MED , from DPMC and a few ministerial staff .
It was a small room and very cosy .
The meeting was set down for 45 minutes from 3:45 .
When it opened , Judith Tizard spent 30 minutes telling us why the change had to be made .
She began by strongly expressing her anger that we had complained to her at this stage in the proceedings .
None of us , she said , had been to see her before this on this topic .
When we protested that we had worked with the Select Committee , which had removed this provision – and balanced it with one which made licence holders liable for false accusations – she said that this was completely inappropriate of the Select Committee , because Cabinet had already decided this was going ahead .
We should not have been surprised , we were told , that this provision was reinserted by the government at the last minute before the bill was passed .
( It ’s worth noting here that Judith has been to the two New Zealand Foo Camps and was engaged roundly on copyright both times . )
She set forth strong views about how the launch of Sione ’s Wedding had been ruined , about how studios in Auckland were running out of work , and about how artists were mortgaging their homes to make films and music and were not making any returns on their investments , all , she said , because of Internet piracy .
One of the Internet group tried to ask her whether the term piracy was appropriate , but she insisted that it was because people ’s livelihoods were at stake .
She also said that , since the Internet Service Providers were making money from providing Internet they were making money from copyright infringements and they have to find a way to deal with it .
This was couched in very strong language .
When we suggested that natural justice would imply that it was unreasonable to withdraw Internet access based on an accusation , she reiterated her position that something had to be done and that ISPs had to do it .
ISPs , she said , need to negotiate with the licence holders to put in a regime to prevent copyright infringements .
The licence holders ’ associations had assured her that they would not be unreasonable .
In response to being told that it is technically impossible for ISPs to tell what people are doing , Judith said that it had been done for child pornography and that ISPs need to apply the same standards .
It was pointed out that the state defines objectionable material , possession of which is a crime , but there ’s no equivalent definition for copyright , infringement of which is a civil matter to be determined by courts .
It was said several times that ISPs have liability in both directions because of this law .
The message was : deal with it .
David Cunliffe made it clear that the law change is going live on 28th February regardless .
He urged ISPs and licence holders organisations to agree policy .
David Cunliffe left the meeting at 4:30 as he had foreshadowed .
I left soon after to take my family on holiday .
I understand that little more took place after that except reiterations of positions .
Michael Gove , shadow children 's secretary , said : " We 've slipped 10 places in the international league tables for science and children are being asked questions that show our curriculum is n't preparing them for the challenges for the twenty first century .
That 's why we need to make sure that our exams are as good as the world 's best . "

Now that two whistleblowers have come forward with allegations that the Bush neocons used the NSA to spy on U.S. military officers , American journalists , American aid workers , and others who were calling home from abroad , Democrat Jay Rockefeller is calling for another Church Committee investigation of the NSA .
Amy Goodman reports on two influential congressional committees opening probes into allegations U.S. intelligence spied on the phone calls of American military personnel , journalists , and aid workers in Iraq .
Rockefeller , however , and Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid , were briefed on the NSA snoop program back in 2003 and said nothing about it .
Rockefeller did write a two - page letter to Cheney expressing his “ concerns ” about the surveillance .
“ But Rockefeller never did anything beyond that , such as contacting a lawyer , ” writes Declan McCullagh for CNet News , even though the Senate Intelligence committee is officially charged with “ vigilant legislative oversight over the intelligence activities of the United States to assure that such activities are in conformity with the Constitution and laws of the United States . ”
NSA and government surveillance of Americans is hardly limited to overseas phone calls .
“ The government admits that the warrantless wiretapping of Americans ’ international phone calls and emails is only a part of its secret post 9/11 intelligence operations inside the country , ” notes Ryan Singel for Wired .
Singel points out that the secret snoop program authorized by Bush is so intrusive and egregious it almost led to the resignation of Attorney General John Ashcroft and the head of the FBI Robert Mueller .
“ One suspects it has something to do with purely domestic communications , which do n’t come close to falling into the grey zones of the complicated rules about when the government does and does not need a court order to wiretap . ”
McCullagh comments :
In decades past , government agencies have subjected hundreds of thousands of law - abiding Americans to unlawful surveillance , illegal wiretaps and warrantless searches .
Eleanor Roosevelt , Martin Luther King Jr. , feminists , gay rights leaders , and Catholic priests were spied upon .
The FBI used secret files and hidden microphones to blackmail the Kennedy brothers , sway the Supreme Court , and influence presidential elections .
In addition to the NSA and the FBI , military intelligence is in the business of snooping on Americans for their political beliefs .
As NBC reported back in 2005 , the Pentagon has busied itself with monitoring antiwar groups .
NBC described the Pentagon ’s Counterintelligence Field Activity , or CIFA , as a “ superpower of data mining within the U.S. national security community . ”
The CIFA was supposedly “ disestablished ” on August 4 by the Department of Defense , but as we know the government rarely closes the doors on successful intelligence operations .
The DoD simply rolled CIFA into its Defense Counterintelligence and Human Intelligence Center , operated by the Defense Intelligence Agency .
CIFA ’s stand alone operation was not “ disestablished ” because it was a threat to the civil liberties of Americans , but rather because it “ was mired in cronyism , scandal and corruption , ” according to Tom Burghardt .
According to Doug Thompson , it did n’t take long for Michael Hayden to dedicate the CIA to domestic spying in violation of its charter .
“ Now that he is officially sworn in as the new head of the Central Intelligence Agency , Gen. Michael Hayden plans to build a vast domestic spying network that will pry into the lives of most Americans around the clock , ” Thompson wrote for Capitol Hill Blue on May 31 , 2006 .
Can I prove this in a court of law ?
No .
Do I know it is happening ?
Yes , without a doubt .
Enough sources within the CIA , FBI , NSA and Pentagon have come forward in recent days to warn about Hayden ’s plans for an expanded , consolidated spy network aimed at Americans , not terrorists , and violating numerous laws that prohibit such activities against citizens of this country … .
Hayden , who oversaw the National Security Agency ’s questionable monitoring of phone calls and emails of Americas , plans to consolidate much of the country ’s domestic spying into a new desk at the CIA , calling it a “ domestic terrorism prevention ” operation .
The desk will oversee not only NSA ’s increased monitoring of electronic communications by Americans but also the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ’s “ terrorist information awareness ” program that monitors travel and financial activities by Americans by gathering real - time data from banks , airlines , travel agencies and credit card companies .
The CIA operation will also coordinate with the Pentagon ’s domestic spying program that monitors activities of anti-war groups , organizations critical of the Bush administrations and others tagged as enemies of the state .
In fact , as early as 2002 , the CIA began “ increasing its presence at FBI field offices by assigning intelligence officers to domestic anti-terrorism teams , ” the Associated Press reported at the time .
“ They serve as conduits of information , providing the FBI and local police distilled intelligence that the CIA and other services have collected overseas , officials said .
At the same time , information gathered by local law enforcement on potential terrorist activities is sent to CIA headquarters . ”
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Operation CHAOS , Project MERRIMAC , Project RESISTANCE , and Project 2 are domestic “ espionage ” projects conducted by the CIA in the 1960s .
It is only natural to assume they have parallels today , especially considering Michael Hayden is now at the helm of the agency .
Of course , when it comes to snoop programs — and , indeed , sabotage programs — directed against the American people , we are seeing only a small glimmer of the whole picture .
Recall former NSA staffer Russell Tice telling the Senate Armed Services Committee in 2006 : “ In my case , there ’s no way the programs I want to talk to Congress about should be public ever , unless maybe in 200 years they want to declassify them .
You should never learn about it ; no one at the Times should ever learn about these things . ”
Recent investigative news articles reveal the existence of a huge database tracking the activities of more than eight million Americans .
Called Main Core , the system , under the auspices of COG ( Continuity of Government ) , monitors email , web activity , telephone and private financial information of Americans considered “ unfriendly , and who , in a time of panic , might be incarcerated .
The database can identify and locate perceived ‘ enemies of the state ’ almost instantaneously . ”
Main Core has roots going back at least to the 1980s and was set up with help from the Defense Intelligence Agency .
( See Christopher Ketcham ’s The Last Roundup , published in the May / June issue of Radar Magazine . )
It should be frightfully obvious by now that not only did the government not close down its domestic surveillance shop after the revelations of the Church Committee in the mid-1970s , it has in fact increased these operations and multiplied their effectiveness with the latest computer and communications technology .
“ A host of publicly disclosed programs , sources say , now supply data to Main Core .
Most notable are the NSA domestic surveillance programs , initiated in the wake of 9/11 , typically referred to in press reports as ‘ warrantless wiretapping , ' ” writes Ketcham .
In short , the government now has an integrated , real - time program for surveilling Americans .
As history demonstrates , such programs are not used to keep track of al - CIA - duh and other government manufactured terror groups , but rather the real enemy — the American people , especially those in political opposition to the government .

With Hurricane Dolly bearing down on Brownsville , Texans can say they know a thing or two about horrific storms .
The state is second only to Florida in the number of direct hurricane hits .
And while Dolly is expected to cause serious flooding , it is unlikely to be anything like the deadliest hurricane ever to strike the United States , one that struck Galveston , Texas , more than a century ago .
Early on the evening of Sept. 8 , 1900 , a powerful Category 4 storm , with sustained winds over 130 mph , roared ashore .
Storm surges of 8 to 15 feet swamped all of Galveston Island and inundated other parts of the nearby Texas coast , according to a National Hurricane Center historical account .
Half the homes on Galveston were swept away , according to NOAA , the hurricane center 's parent organization .
The storm left somewhere between 8,000 and 12,000 dead .
Most of the deaths were due to the storm surge .
In the entire Atlantic Basin , only an October 1780 hurricane that killed 20,000 or so on Caribbean islands was deadlier .
Things were different back then .
There were no satellites , of course , and no radar .
Weather forecasts were less accurate and provided less warning time .
The 1900 hurricane came in from the Caribbean , across the Gulf of Mexico , swooped up through Texas and across the Midwest before finally skirting Canada and shooting back into the Atlantic .
Warnings were issued by what was then known as the Weather Bureau .
The real problem , according to a NOAA analysis : " Many did n't heed the warnings , preferring instead to watch the huge waves . "
The following account of the water 's rapid rise comes from Isaac M. Cline , the senior Weather Bureau employee in Galveston at the time :
" By 8 p.m . a number of houses had drifted up and lodged to the east and southeast of my residence , and these with the force of the waves acted as a battering ram against which it was impossible for any building to stand for any length of time , and at 8:30 p.m. my residence went down with about fifty persons who had sought it for safety , and all but eighteen were hurled into eternity .
Among the lost was my wife , who never rose above the water after the wreck of the building .
I was nearly drowned and became unconscious , but recovered though being crushed by timbers and found myself clinging to my youngest child , who had gone down with myself and wife . "
Cline floated with small group of other people for three hours until the water began to drop .
" We landed about 11:30 p.m. , by climbing over floating debris to a residence on Twenty - eighth Street and Avenue P , " he wrote .
Between 1900 and 2004 , Florida was hit by 64 hurricanes , Texas absorbed 38 , and North Carolina took the brunt of 29 .
Over the past century , conditions have changed as the planet has warmed .
Scientists now say the Atlantic hurricane season is getting longer , with strong storms emerging earlier in the season .
An Integrated Code Generator for GHC
We propose reworking GHC's back end into an Integrated Code Generator , which will widen the interface between machine - independent and machine - dependent parts of the back end .
We wish to dissolve the barrier between the current machine - independent transformations ( CPS conversion , stack layout , etc ) and the native - code generators ( instruction selection , calling conventions , register allocation -- including spilling to the C stack , etc ) .
The goal is instead to have a code generator that integrates both machine - independent and machine - dependent components , which will interact through wide but well - specified interfaces .
From this refactoring we expect the following benefits :
The back end will be simpler overall , primarily because the refactoring will reduce or eliminate duplication of code
Complexity will be isolated in two modules with well - defined interfaces : a dataflow engine and a register allocator
GHC will generate better machine code , primarily because important decisions about register usage will be made at a later stage of translation and will exploit knowledge of the actual target machine .
Design elements
The important elements of our design are as follows :
Build two big hammers , and hit as many nails as possible .
( The big hammers are the dataflow optimization engine and a coalescing register allocator .
For more on their uses , see our design philosophy . )
The hammer itself may be big and complicated , but using a big hammer should be easy and should give easily predictable results .
Load all back ends into every instance of the compiler , and treat every compilation as a cross-compilation .
Despite having been used in production compilers for at least twenty years , this technique is still seen as somewhat unorthodox , but it removes many #ifdef s and saves significant complexity at compiler - configuration time .
Removing #ifdef s also mitigates problems with validating the compiler under different build configurations .
Design philosophy
State - of - the art dataflow optimization and register allocation both require complex implementations .
We live with this complexity because creating new clients is easy .
Dataflow optimization :
We can define a new optimization simply by defining a lattice of dataflow facts ( akin to a specialized logic ) and then writing the dataflow - transfer functions found in compiler textbooks .
Handing these functions to the dataflow engine produces a new optimization that is not only useful on its own , but that can easily be composed with other optimizations to create an integrated " superoptimization " that is strictly more powerful than any sequence of individual optimizations , no matter how many times they are re-run .
The dataflow engine is based on ( Lerner , Grove , and Chambers 2002 ) ; you can find a functional implementation of the dataflow engine presented in ( Ramsey and Dias 2005 ) .
Coalescing register allocator :
The back end can use fresh temporaries and register - register moves with abandon , knowing that a state - of - the - art register allocator will eliminate almost all move instructions .
Back ends :
Our ultimate goal is to make adding a new back end easy as well .
In the long run , we wish to apply John Dias 's dissertation work to GHC .
In the short run , however , we think it more sensible to represent each target - machine instruction set with an algebraic datatype .
We propose to use type classes to define common functions such as identifying the registers read and written by each instruction .
Proposed compilation pipeline
Convert from STG to an control flow graph CmmGraph : Instruction selection : Optimise : Proc-point analysis , and transformation Register allocation Stack layout Tidy up
Convert from STG to control flow graph
Convert from STG to an control flow graph CmmGraph ( compiler / cmm/ ZipCfg.hs , compiler /cmm/ZipCfgCmmRep.hs ) .
This step is Simon PJ's " new code generator " from September 2007 .
This conversion may introduce new variables , stack slots , and compile - time constants .
STG -> CmmGraph Cmm. Middle Cmm. Last
Implements calling conventions for call , jump , and return instructions : all parameter passing is turned into data - movement instructions ( register - to - register move , load , or store ) , and stack - pointer adjustments are inserted .
After this point , calls , returns , and jumps are just control - transfer instructions -- the parameter passing has been compiled away .
How do we refer to locations on the stack when we have n't laid it out yet ?
The compiler names a stack slot using the idea of a " late compile - time constant , " which is just a symbolic constant that will be replaced with an actual stack offset when the stack layout is chosen .
One departure from the old code generator is that we do not build a Cmm abstract - syntax tree ; instead we go straight to a control - flow graph .
In practice , we first generate an " abstract control flow graph " , CmmAGraph , which makes the business of generating fresh Block Id s more convenient , and convert that to a CmmGraph .
The former is convenient for construction but cannot be analysed ; the latter is concrete , and can be analyzed , transformed , and optimized .
Instruction selection
Instruction selection : each Cmm Middle and Last node in the control - flow graph is replaced with a new graph in which the nodes are machine instructions .
CmmGraph Cmm. Middle Cmm.Last -> CmmGraph I386 .
Middle I386 .
Last
The I386 .
Middle type represents computational machine instructions ; the I386 .
Last type represents control - transfer instructions .
The choice of representation is up to the author of the back end , but for continuity with the existing native code generators , we expect to begin by using algebraic data types inspired by the existing definitions in compiler / nativeGen /MachInstrs.hs .
Note that the graph still contains :
Variables ( ie local register that are not yet mapped to particular machine registers )
( ie local register that are not yet mapped to particular machine registers )
Stack - slot addressing modes , which include late - bound compile - time constants , such as the offset in the frame of the a variable spill location , or Block Id stack - top - on - entry .
The invariant is that each node could be done by one machine instruction , provided each LocalReg maps to a ( suitable ) physical register ; and an instruction involving a stack - slot can cope with ( Sp+n ) .
An extremely important distinction from the existing code is that we plan to eliminate #ifdef and instead provide multiple datatypes , e.g. , in I386.hs , PpcInstrs.hs , Sparc.hs , and so on .
Similarly , we expect a an instruction selector for each back end , so for example , we might have a transformation that maps LGraph Cmm.
Middle Cmm.
Last ( with variables , stack slots , and compile - time constants ) -> LGraph I86 .
Middle I386 .
Last ( with variables , stack slots , and compile - time constants ) .
We expect to abstract away from the details of these representations by borrowing some abstractions from Machine SUIF .
In the longer term we would like to support RTL - based representations such as are used in gcc , vpo and Quick C--.
What this means is that I386 .
Middle ( etc ) is an abstract type , an instance of type class that supports the functions that the rest of the pipeline needs .
For example :
class Instr i where defs :: i -> [ LocalReg ] uses :: i -> [ LocalReg ] ..etc..
This allows us to make code improvements machine - independent , by using machine - dependent functions to capture the semantics of instructions .
Figuring out precisely what the interface should be is a key step .
For example , to support copy propagation we might want an operation
isCopy :: i -> Maybe ( LocalReg , LocalReg )
Similarly , to support peephole optimsation ( eg transform x = y+ 2 ; p = bits32 [ x ] to p = bits32 [ y + 2 ] ) we might want something like
availExprs :: i -> [ ( LocalReg , CmmExpr ) ] substExprs :: [ ( LocalReg , CmmExpr ) ] -> i -> Maybe i
The substExprs operation returns a Just iff a substitution took place .
Interfaces like these would require the machine - specific abstract type i to contain enough information to reconstruct a LocalReg or CmmExpr .
Later one , we 'll need to construct SRTs too , so we must continue to track pointer - hood .
One possible implementation for I386 or Sparc would be to use a generic RTL representation , together with a recogniser to maintain the machine invariant .
Our initial idea , though , is that is an implementation choice .
It 's still possible that a machine - independent optimisation could take advantage of the representation being an RTL .
For example , we could provide a function in the Instr class
rtl :: i -> RTL
which is particularly cheap for architectures that do use RTL as the representation type .
Optimisation
Optimise the code .
LGraph Instrs ( with variables , stack slots , and compile - time constants ) ->
LGraph Instrs ( with variables , stack slots , and compile - time constants ) , such as
Branch chain elimination .
Remove unreachable blocks ( dead code ) .
Constant propagation .
Copy propagation .
Lazy code motion ( hoisting , sinking , partial redundancy elimination ) .
Block concatenation .
branch to K ; and this is the only use of K .
Common Block Elimination ( like CSE ) .
This essentially implements the Adams optimisation , we believe .
Consider ( sometime ) : block duplication .
branch to K ; and K is a short block .
Branch chain elimination is just a special case of this .
Peephole optimisation .
The difficulty of implementing a good peephole optimizer varies greatly with the representation of instructions .
We propose to postpone serious work on peephole optimization until we have a back end capable of representing machine instructions as RTLs , which makes peephole optimization trivial .
Proc-point analysis
analyse :: CmmGraph I386 .
Middle I386 .
Last -> [ Block Id ] transform :: [ BlockId ] -> CmmGraph I386 .
Middle I386 .
Last -> CmmGraph I386 .
Middle I386 .
Last
Both input and output still have variables and stack - slot addressing modes .
Proc points are found , and the appropriate control - transfer instructions are inserted .
Why so early ( before register allocation , stack layout ) ?
Depending on the back end ( think of C as the worst case ) , the proc-point analysis might have to satisfy some horrible calling convention .
We want to make these requirements explicit before we get to the register allocator .
We also want to exploit the register allocator to make the best possible decisions about which live variables ( if any ) should be in registers at a proc point .
Register allocation
Register allocation replaces variable references with machine register and stack slots .
This may introduce spills and reloads ( to account for register shortage ) , which which is why we may get new stack - slot references .
That is , register allocation takes LGraph Instrs ( with variables , stack slots ) -> LGraph Instrs ( with stack slots only ) .
No more variables !
We no longer need to spill to the C stack , because we have fully allocated everything to machine registers .
Stack layout
Stack Layout : LGraph Instrs ( with stack slots , and compile - time constants ) -> LGraph Instrs
Choose a stack layout .
Replace references to stack slots with addresses on the stack .
Replace compile - time constants with offsets into the stack .
No more stack - slot references .
Tidy up
Proc-point splitting : LGraph Instrs -> [ LGraph Instrs ]
Each proc point gets its own procedure .
Code layout : LGraph Instrs -> [ String ]
A reverse postorder depth - first traversal simultaneously converts the graph to sequential code and converts each instruction into an assembly - code string : Assembly code ahoy !
A key property of the design is that the scopes of machine - dependent code and machine - dependent static types are limited as much as possible :

LONDON , England ( CNN ) --
Picture this : you 're sat down for the Football World Cup final , or a long - awaited sequel to the " Sex and the City " movie and you 're watching all the action unfold in 3 - D on your coffee table .
The future of television ?
This image is an impression of what 3D holographic television may look like .
It sounds a lot like a wacky dream , but do n't be surprised if within our lifetime you find yourself discarding your plasma and LCD sets in exchange for a holographic 3 - D television that can put Cristiano Ronaldo in your living room or bring you face - to - face with life - sized versions of your gaming heroes .
The reason for renewed optimism in three - dimensional technology is a breakthrough in rewritable and erasable holographic systems made earlier this year by researchers at the University of Arizona .
Dr Nasser Peyghambarian , chair of photonics and lasers at the university 's Optical Sciences department , told CNN that scientists have broken a barrier by making the first updatable three - dimensional displays with memory .
" This is a prerequisite for any type of moving holographic technology .
The way it works presently is not suitable for 3 - D images , " he said .
The researchers produced displays that can be erased and rewritten in a matter of minutes .
To create television sets the images would need to be changing multiple times each second -- but Peyghambarian is very optimistic this can happen .
He said the University of Arizona team , which is now ten-strong , has been working on advancing hologram technology since 1990 -- so this is a major step forward .
He believes that much of the difficulty in creating a holographic set has now been overcome .
" It took us a while to make that first breakthrough , but as soon as you have the first element of it working the rest often comes more rapidly , " he said .
" What we are doing now is trying to make the model better .
What we showed is just one color , what we are doing now is trying to use three colors .
The original display was four inches by four inches and now we 're going for something at least as big as a computer screen . "
There are no more great barriers to overcome now , he said .
The breakthrough has made some long - time researchers of the technology believe that it could now come to fruition .
Tung H. Jeong , a retired physics professor at Lake Forest College outside Chicago who had studied holography since the 1960s told NJ.com ; " When we start talking about erasable and rewritable holograms , we are moving toward the possibility of holographic TV ...
It has now been shown that physically , it 's possible . "
And what might these holographic televisions look like ?
According to Peyghambarian , they could be constructed as a screen on the wall ( like flat panel displays ) that shows 3 - D images , with all the image writing lasers behind the wall ; or it could be like a horizontal panel on a table with holographic writing apparatus underneath .
So , if this project is realized , you really could have a football match on your coffee table , or horror - movie villains jumping out of your wall .
Peyghambarian is also optimistic that the technology could reach the market within five to ten years .
He said progress towards a final product should be made much more quickly now that a rewriting method had been found .
However , it is fair to say not everyone is as positive about this prospect as Peyghambarian .
Justin Lawrence , a lecturer in Electronic Engineering at Bangor University in Wales , told CNN that small steps are being made on technology like 3 - D holograms , but , he can't see it being ready for the market in the next ten years .
" It 's one thing to demonstrate something in a lab but it 's another thing to be able to produce it cheaply and efficiently enough to distribute it to the mass market , " Lawrence said .
Yet , there are reasons to be optimistic that more resources will be channeled into developing this technology more quickly .
The Japanese Government is pushing huge financial and technical weight into the development of three - dimensional , virtual - reality television , and the country 's Communications Ministry is aiming at having such technology available by 2020 .
Peyghambarian said there are no major sponsors of the technology at present , but as the breakthroughs continued , he hopes that will change .
Even if no major electronics company commit themselves , there is hope that backers could come from outside of the consumer electronics industry , he said .
" It could have some other applications .
In training it 's useful to show people three - dimensional displays .
Also it would be good to show things in 3 - D for defense command and control and for surgery , " he said .
Studs Terkel , who made his name listening to ordinary folks talk about their ordinary lives -- and who turned that knack for conversation into a much - honored literary career -- died Friday .
He was 96 .
Terkel died of old age at his home in Chicago , his son Dan said .
“ He lived a long , eventful , satisfying , though sometimes tempestuous life , ” Dan Terkell said .
“ I think that pretty well sums it up . ”
The author of blockbuster oral histories on World War II , the Great Depression and contemporary attitudes toward work , Terkel roamed the country engaging an astounding cross-section of Americans in tape - recorded chats -- about their dreams , their fears , their chewing gum , about racism , courage , dirty floors and the Beatles .
With his loud laugh and raspy voice , plus his inept fumbles with his tape recorder , he set his subjects at ease and tugged from them memories , predictions and simple truths about their everyday existence .
Terkel transcribed and edited the interviews , then compiled them into books that were at once intimate and sweeping , among them “ Division Street , ” “ Hard Times , ” “ Working , ” and “ The Good War , ” which won the 1984 Pulitzer Prize for general nonfiction .
Terkel was also a legendary radio personality , hosting a daily music and interview show on Chicago ’s WFMT for 45 years .
He never prepared his questions .
He interrupted his guests often .
Yet Terkel was known as a master interviewer , able to establish an easy rapport with just about anyone .
His secret , he once said , was simple : “ It ’s listening . ”
And listen he did : to sultry jazz singers and insecure housewives ; to a repentant Ku Klux Klan leader ; to Bob Dylan , the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. , Marlene Dietrich , Bertrand Russell ; to a parking lot attendant and a lesbian grandmother ; to a piano tuner ; and to a barber .
As the late CBS newsman Charles Kuralt once said : “ When Studs Terkel listens , everybody talks . ”
Reviewers called Terkel ’s oral histories accessible , powerful and deeply moving .
“ Readers will experience emotions they did n’t know they had , ” the Cleveland Plain Dealer wrote of his World War II book .
Though they were lengthy -- some more than 600 pages -- most of Terkel ’s books shot straight to the bestseller list and much of his work was translated for publication abroad .
“ I think he was the most extraordinary social observer this country has produced , ” said Dr. Robert Coles , a Harvard professor of psychiatry who considered Terkel a friend and inspiration .
Though Terkel did interview the rich and famous , “ he recognized the need to pay attention to the poor , the vulnerable , the ordinary people , ” Coles said .
“ I pray for the day when American universities will understand that Studs Terkel is worth many departments of sociology .
He ’s an institution in himself . ”
Louis “ Studs ” Terkel was born May 16 , 1912 , in New York City .
His family moved to Chicago when he was a boy , and he quickly grew to love the city .
“ It ’s not that Chicago is that great , ” he once said .
“ In fact , it ’s horrible .
But living here is like being married to a woman with a broken nose .
There may be lovelier lovelies , but never a lovely so real . ”
Real was what Terkel always wanted to get at : real people , real lives and real emotions .
He did not claim to be a social scientist .
He did not seek to conduct a statistically valid poll .
He simply talked to people he found interesting .
He did n’t hide his liberal politics , and at times his cross-sections seemed tilted heavily to the left .
In general , though , Terkel sought to reach across lines of politics , race , class , education and geography to coax America ’s history from its varied voices .
“ ‘ Statistics ’ become persons , each one unique , ” he once wrote .
“ I am constantly astonished . ”
Terkel developed his taste for gabbing as a child hanging out with the blue - collar workers who lived in his family ’s Chicago rooming house .
The men would get drunk on a Saturday night and talk to young Terkel for hours .
His father , a tailor , died when Terkel was 19 .
His mother , Anna , was able to put him through the University of Chicago for an undergraduate and a law school education .
Yet Terkel graduated disillusioned with the law .
So he worked for a time as a federal statistician .
He acted in radio soap operas ( usually playing a gangster , with lines of “ stunning banality , ” he recalled ) .
Finally , in the 1940s , he moved into radio full time , first as a newscaster , then as a disc jockey and variety - show host on Chicago ’s WFMT .
By this time , he had thrown off his given name in favor of Studs -- a tribute to the fictional Studs Lonigan , a rough and ready - for - anything character created by novelist James T. Farrell .
Well on his way to becoming a Chicago institution , Terkel expanded into television in 1949 with “ Studs ’ Place . ”
An informal mix of banter and jazz , the show was set in a restaurant .
“ It was kind of like a ‘ Cheers . ’
But better , ” Terkel said years later .
The breezy but smart informality of his programs won Terkel a devoted audience on radio and TV .
“ Studs ’ Place ” ran from 1949 to 1953 -- and was only canceled , Terkel later maintained , because he was blacklisted by Sen.
Joseph McCarthy for his liberal leanings .
( He supported causes like rent control , desegregation and the abolition of the poll tax .
“ In those days , it was all quite radical , ” he recalled . )
Throughout the 1950s and ‘ 60s , Terkel continued to broadcast his radio interviews while writing newspaper columns , acting in Chicago theaters and even penning plays of his own .
He hit upon oral history as an outlet for his insatiable curiosity in 1967 , when at the age of 55 he published “ Division Street : America ” -- a series of conversations about race with Chicago residents .
The New York Times praised the book as “ a modern morality play , a drama with as many conflicts as life itself . ”
Terkel had himself a new career .
Blending journalism , history , sociology and literature , Terkel traipsed across the country , tape recorder at the ready , for the next 3 1/2 decades .
“ I tape , therefore I am , ” Terkel used to say .
“ Only one other man has used the tape recorder with as much fervor as I -- Richard Nixon . ”
Terkel ’s techniques came in for some criticism , especially after “ The Good War ” won a Pulitzer Prize .
Some called his work overly sentimental .
Others accused him of letting his liberal politics taint his selection of interview subjects and his editing of conversations .
Still others wondered aloud how Terkel could be considered a master author when he did little more than transcribe other people ’s memories .
In response , Terkel said he had but one goal for each of his books : to open new worlds for his readers .
He wanted them to feel what it was like to be a laid - off factory hand during the Depression .
Or a soldier facing his first enemy fire .
Or a black businessman , or a poor Latino .
Or a Miss USA .
“ If I can get that in a book , ” Terkel said , “ that ’s what it ’s all about . ”
Thus , in “ Hard Times , ” he probed the guilt many senior citizens felt for having survived the Great Depression .
In “ Working , ” he let Americans vent about their jobs -- and found a depressing majority saw themselves as automatons .
In “ The Good War , ” he got his subjects to discuss racism , officers shot in the back by their own troops , and other topics that mainstream historians had shied away from .
“ No one has done more to expand the American library of voices , ” President Clinton said upon awarding Terkel a National Humanities Medal in 1997 .
“ People would say the truth to him even when they had lied to themselves for their [ whole ] lives , ” Terkel ’s longtime editor , Andre Schiffrin , added .
“ The key thing was his respect for them .
He was n’t there to use them .
He was n’t there to make a point .
He really wanted to hear what they had to say , and he respected them . ”
Terkel , his editor added , was “ a true democrat . ”
Editing his interviews into book - ready segments took great discipline ; often , Terkel had room for less than 10 % of his material .
Exchanging draft after draft with Schiffrin -- who published all his books at New Press -- Terkel would struggle to distill an evening ’s conversation into an essential , honest portrait of just five or six pages .
In his later years , Terkel returned to his original tapes to mine material for new books -- and to catalog reel after reel in the Chicago Historical Society archive .
( The society has put excerpts from those interviews online at www.studsterkel.org.)
The exercise was his way of combating what he described as “ national Alzheimer ’s disease ” -- the rush - rush , live for the minute pace he deplored as irreverent and dangerous .
“ We do n’t remember anything .
There ’s no yesterday in this country , ” he often complained .
“ I want to re-create those yesterdays . ”
Despite his passion for the past , Terkel did n’t live in it ; he kept a hectic schedule of travel , interviews and writing even after signing off from his daily radio show on Jan. 1 , 1988 .
That same year he appeared in “ Eight Men Out , ” a film about the Black Sox scandal of 1919 , in the role of a savvy newspaperman .
In 1996 , Terkel had quintuple bypass surgery -- and emerged hale as ever , still dedicated to his daily routine of two martinis , two cigars , and too many hours at the electric typewriter .
His book of interviews about death and dying , “ Hope Dies Last , ” was released in 2004 , when he was 92 .
In 2005 , at the age of 93 , Terkel had another round of open - heart surgery , which doctors described as terribly risky for a man his age .
He was back at work within weeks , promoting his 16th book , “ And They All Sang , ” an eclectic collection of interviews from his half - century on the radio .
When officials from Rutgers University knocked on Terkel ’s door in May 2007 to present him with the Stephen E. Ambrose Oral History Award , they could hear furious typing inside .
At the age of 95 , he was polishing his memoir , “ Touch and Go , ” published in 2007 .
Though he was nearly deaf by then , Terkel ’s memory for names , dates and bawdy anecdotes was impeccable .
Dressed in his trademark red and white checked shirt and red socks , Terkel would entertain visitors at his Chicago home with long rants against President Bush .
His monologues were sprinkled with an array of allusions :
He ’d quote Shakespeare and Henry Kissinger and “ Ode on a Grecian Urn ” -- and then , moments later , delve into the details of the 1920s Teapot Dome scandal .
Though rarely given to introspection , Terkel did tell one interviewer that he felt he had shortchanged his family by being so absorbed in his work .
His wife of 60 years , Ida , died in 1999 .
He is survived by their son , Dan , who altered the spelling of his last name to Terkell .
Terkel planned his funeral years ago .
He wanted readings from Mark Twain and George Bernard Shaw ; music from Schubert and Mississippi bluesman Big Bill Broonzy .
He wanted his ashes -- and Ida ’s -- to be scattered in the Chicago square where , as a young man , he stood on a soapbox and shouted out his leftist views .
And Studs Terkel wanted this as his epitaph : “ Curiosity did not kill this cat . ”

GHAZNI , Afghanistan — Throughout Afghanistan , roadside bombs are increasing not only in number but also in size , with devastating consequences for U.S. troops and beleaguered Afghan truck drivers alike .
Culverts that run under the road to help drain and irrigate surrounding fields in the rural country now regularly conceal these powerful improvised explosive devices , or IEDs , with increasingly large charges .
Roadside bombs that once weighed 10 to 20 pounds have morphed into multigallon drums packed with 200 to 500 pounds of explosives , which insurgents roll into culverts with wheelbarrows .
The enhanced bombs have in some cases proved effective in destroying the U.S. military 's expensive new Mine Resistant Ambush Protected vehicles — the product of a multibillion dollar investment by the Pentagon that features a V - shaped hull to absorb and disperse the impact of roadside bombs .
The vehicles were not built , however , to withstand 200 - pounds worth of explosives .
" They 've flipped MRAPs 15 feet in the air sometimes , " says one U.S. officer in Afghanistan .
" And they break them in half . "
U.S. troops inside the overturned vehicles have been crushed and seriously injured by falling equipment .
The Taliban 's latest IED offensive has turned Highway 1 , the paved artery that links Kabul to Kandahar , from a once powerful symbol of progress in Afghanistan into a deadly stretch littered with burned - out bridges and smoldering trucks .
The new bombs , which U.S. military officials say began cropping up in June , are part of an insurgent effort , they add , to disrupt commerce , create chaos , and strike at the heart of government efforts to bring progress to strategic provinces like Ghazni .
Highway 1 runs through the province , which remains home to a number of Taliban leaders .
The construction - grade explosives are trucked in from Quetta , a Taliban stronghold in neighboring Pakistan , according to U.S. intelligence officials .
But the material is manufactured elsewhere , leading officials to believe that insurgents are bypassing border crossings in eastern Afghanistan , where U.S. troops have a greater presence , to bring them in through southern provinces .
U.S. troop presence is sparse to nonexistent in the south of the country .
The 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit returned from violent Helmand province in early October , and for now , U.S. troops are stretched too thin , say Pentagon officials , to replace the marines .
On one recent drive between U.S. military installations in Ghazni province , troops from the 1st Battalion of the 506th Infantry Regiment dismounted to check each culvert along a paved road pocked with craters and blown - out bridges .
It is painstaking and time - consuming work — the culverts are every 100 meters apart in some areas .
Insurgents " are targeting the infrastructure , because that 's what the government can provide , " says Capt .
Spencer Wallace , a company commander with the battalion .
But recently the battalion caught a high - tech intelligence break when an unmanned aerial vehicle discovered a nine - man team planting IEDs near a U.S. forward operating base and called in an air strike .
When troops got to the scene , they found bodies with watches set to Pakistan time and pockets full of Pakistani money .
It was , they surmised , a cell sent to train Afghan insurgents to build and plant large roadside bombs .
With the help of intelligence streams from more UAVs , the battalion was able to track down five IED - planting teams in seven nights , leading to a decrease in roadside bombs in the area .
Overall , those kinds of attacks have decreased from 30 a month in July and August to some five a month in September and October .
But the ongoing concern , says one U.S. military official , is that there simply are not enough unmanned drones to go around , and the prospect of U.S. troops checking every culvert they cross is unrealistic .
" We need more consistent [ UAV ] surveillance , " says the official .
" Because these guys will regroup and come back . "
C# is a strongly typed object - oriented language whose code visually resembles C++ ( and Java ) .
This decision by the C# language designers allows C++ developers to easily leverage their knowledge to quickly become productive in C# .
C# syntax differs from C++ in some ways , but most of the differences between these languages are semantic and behavioral , stemming from differences in the runtime environments in which they execute .
C #
C# source code compiles into managed code .
Managed code , as you may already know , is an intermediate language ( IL ) because it is halfway between the high - level language ( C# ) and the lowest - level language ( assembly / machine code ) .
At run time , the Common Language Runtime ( CLR ) compiles the code on the fly by using Just In Time ( JIT ) compiling .
As with just about anything in engineering , this technique comes with its pros and cons .
It may seem that an obvious con is the inefficiency of compiling the code at run time .
This process is different from interpreting , which is typically used by scripting languages such as Perl and JScript .
The JIT compiler does n’t compile a function or method each and every time it ’s called ; it does so only the first time , and when it does , it produces machine code native to the platform on which it ’s running .
An obvious pro of JIT compiling is that the working set of the application is reduced , because the memory footprint of intermediate code is smaller .
During the execution of the application , only the needed code is JIT - compiled .
If your application contains printing code , for example , that code is not needed if the user never prints a document , and therefore the JIT compiler never compiles it .
Moreover , the CLR can optimize the program ’s execution on the fly at run time .
For example , the CLR may determine a way to reduce page faults in the memory manager by rearranging compiled code in memory , and it could do all this at run time .
Once you weigh all the pros together , you find that they outweigh the cons for most applications .
C++
Unlike C# , C++ code traditionally compiles into native code .
Native code is the machine code that ’s native to the processor for which the program was compiled .
For the sake of discussion , assume that we ’re talking about natively compiled C++ code rather than managed C++ which can be achieved by using C++/CLI .
If you want your native C++ application to run on different platforms , such as on both a 32 - bit platform and a 64 - bit platform , you must compile it separately for each .
The native binary output is generally not compatible across platforms .
IL , on the other hand , is compatible across platforms , because it , along with the Common Language Infrastructure ( CLI ) upon which the CLR is built , is a defined international standard .
This standard is rapidly gaining traction and being implemented beyond the Microsoft Windows platform .
Included in the CLI standard is the Portable Executable ( PE ) file format for managed modules .
Therefore , you can actually compile a C# program on a Windows platform and execute the output on both Windows and Linux without having to recompile , because even the file format is standardized .
This degree of portability is extremely convenient and was in the hearts and minds of the COM / DCOM designers back in the day , but for various reasons , it failed to succeed across disparate platforms at this level .
One of the major reasons for that failure is that COM lacked a sufficiently expressive and extensible mechanism for describing types and their dependencies .
The CLI specification solves this nicely by introducing metadata .
CLR Garbage Collection
One of the key facilities in the CLR is the garbage collector ( GC ) .
The GC frees you from the burden of handling memory allocation and deallocation , which is where many software errors can occur .
However , the GC does n’t remove all resource - handling burdens from your plate .
A file handle is a resource that must be freed when the consumer is finished with it , just as memory must be freed in the same way .
The GC handles only memory resources directly .
To handle resources other than memory , such as database connections and file handles , you can use a finalizer to free your resources when the GC notifies you that your object is being destroyed .
However , an even better way is to use the Disposable pattern for this task .
The CLR references all objects of reference type indirectly , similar to the way you use pointers and references in C++ , except without the pointer syntax .
When you declare a variable of a reference type in C# , you actually reserve a storage location that has a type associated with it , either on the heap or on the stack , which stores the reference to the object .
So when you copy an object reference in one variable into another variable , you end up with two variables referencing the same object .
All reference type instances live on the managed heap .
The CLR manages the location of these objects , and if it needs to move them around , it updates all the outstanding references to the moved objects to point to the new location .
Also , value types exist in the CLR , and instances of them live on the stack or as a field of an object on the managed heap .
Their usage comes with many restrictions and nuances .
You normally use them when you need a lightweight structure to manage some related data .
Value types are also useful when modeling an immutable chunk of data .
C# allows you to develop applications rapidly while dealing with fewer mundane details than in a C++ environment .
At the same time , C# provides a language that feels familiar to either C++ or Java developers .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- AIG Chief Executive Edward Liddy agreed to slash his annual salary to $ 1 as part of a series of voluntary pay restrictions by top executives tied to a massive $ 150 billion government bailout .
AIG ( AIG , Fortune 500 ) will also forgo bonuses this year and eliminate pay increases through 2009 for the firm 's top executives .
Liddy will get paid $ 1 per year for 2008 and 2009 , with his compensation consisting entirely of equity payments .
While he will not receive bonuses during those years , he will be eligible in 2010 for " extraordinary performance . "
He will also be ineligible for severance payments .
" This action by the senior management team demonstrates not only that we understand our obligation to taxpayers and shareholders , but also that we are committed to the future success of this organization , " said Liddy in a statement .
In addition to Liddy , Paula Reynolds , whom AIG hired as chief restructuring officer in October , will receive no salary or bonuses in 2008 .
From 2009 onward , any compensation above her base pay will be tied to the progress of AIG 's restructuring .
" It is only fair that top executives , who benefit the most when firms do well , should also bear the burden of the difficult economic consequences their firms now face , " said New York state Attorney General Andrew Cuomo in response to a letter from Liddy informing him of the pay cuts .
Cuomo had voiced concern about AIG 's expenditures in October after it was reported that the company had spent $ 440,000 on a weekend meeting at a resort .
Subsequently , AIG immediately cancelled 160 events , worth an estimated $ 8 million .
Government help : AIG has been in full - blown cost - cutting mode since October , as it has been receiving billions in government loans .
AIG 's total government bailout grew to $ 152.5 billion this month .
" If anything , [ the pay cuts are ] largely symbolic , " said Bill Bergman , senior equities analyst with investment research firm Morningstar .
He said AIG 's problems have been mostly internal , partially stemming from a series of failed investments , according to Bergman .
Earlier this month , the government reworked AIG 's original tough bailout terms , which were meant to deter those that could bail themselves out .
As AIG started having trouble repaying the bridge loan , the government agreed to new terms , including reducing the original $ 85 billion bridge loan to $ 60 billion and cutting the interest rate .

Wispy fingers of bright , icy material reach tens of thousands of kilometers outward from Saturn 's moon Enceladus into the E ring , while the moon 's active south polar jets continue to fire away .
This never - before - seen structure is made visible with the sun almost directly behind the Saturn system from Cassini 's vantage point .
These features are very likely the result of particles injected into Saturn orbit by the Enceladus geysers :
Those injected in the direction of the moon 's orbital motion end up on larger , slower orbits and trail Enceladus in its orbit , and those injected into the opposite direction end up smaller , faster orbits and lead Enceladus .
In addition , the configuration of wisps may hint at an interaction between Saturn 's magnetosphere and the torrent of particles issuing from Enceladus .
The view looks down onto Enceladus ( 505 kilometers , or 314 miles across ) from about 15 degrees above the ringplane .
Tethys ( 1,071 kilometers , or 665 miles across ) is visible to the right of Enceladus .
The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft wide - angle camera on Sept. 15 , 2006 , at a distance of approximately 2.1 million kilometers ( 1.3 million miles ) from Enceladus .
Image scale is 128 kilometers ( 80 miles ) per pixel .

Group wants FEC probe of Palin's $ 150 K wardrobe RAW STORY
Published : Thursday October 23 , 2008
Print This Email This
An open government group is requesting an investigation by the Federal Election Commission into the reported $ 150,000 in campaign donations spent to outfit Republican vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin .
Reports emerged this week that the Republican National Committee spent more than three - times the median US family income to buy Palin clothes at posh department stores like Nieman Marcus and Saks Fifth Avenue .
Critics say the six - figure wardrobe budget undercuts Palin's " average American " image , and some are questioning whether the purchases also violate federal election law .
 It is ridiculous that RNC would spend $ 150,000 to outfit a vice presidential nominee and her family at any time , but it is more outrageous given the dire financial straights of so many Americans and the state of our economy , " said Melanie Sloan , executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington .
" As if that isnt bad enough , the expenditures violate campaign finance law .
The FEC should investigate immediately .
CREW says the clothing purchases violate the Federal Election Campaign Act , which prohibits a candidate converting campaign funds to personal use , including clothing .
Republicans have said they planned to donate the clothes to charity after the campaign season is over .
" If the RNC had an extra $ 150,000 to throw around , there were better alternatives than pricey designer clothes , " Sloan said .
" For example , $ 150,000 could fund three Alaska teachers  yearly salaries ; library books for the Juneau , Alaska School district for nearly two years ; health care premiums for 31 working Americans or 12 families ; flu vaccinations for just over 6000 people , or pay the heating bills for 131 low - income households this winter . "
It 's unlikely that the RNC would have been so charitable , of course .
If it had n't purchased Palin 's pricey wardrobe , the money would most likely have paid for a few more attack ads or robo-calls aimed at Barack Obama .
Pixelpipe may be gone but it is not forgotten .
In many ways , the social media sharing service served as a precursor to contemporary content integration applications .
In this post , we look at the history of Pixelpipe , and its progression from a web - based utility to a beloved mobile application .
Lastly , we recommend some apps that offer similar functionality that users can start using today to streamline their social media and blog posts .
What did Pixelpipe do ?
Pixelpipe , a San Francisco - based startup , debuted in the fall of 2008 .
The company ’s first product was a desktop version of its content and file sharing utility .
The software allowed users to publish content , including text , audio , images , and video files , to multiple online platforms at the same time .
Pixelpipe apps
Pixelpipe subsequently released iOS and Android applications .
The apps included an additional feature that integrated a phone ’s camera , allowing users to publish photos without using a 3rd party application .
Apps were also developed for Nokia devices and webOS phones , as well as an email / MMS app .
Pixelpipe pi.pe
The company rolled out pi.pe several years after its debut .
The pi.pe utility allowed users to move media files between different cloud applications .
The utility ’s functionality was enhanced with the addition of pi.pe prints .
With pi.pe prints , users could send photos from their phone or from supported third - party platforms to printers like Walgreens for pickup .
At its height , users could post content to more than 120 different social networks , blogs , and websites .
Pixelpipe had over 1.2 million users across all its platforms .
The company officially closed its doors in late 2013 after it was reportedly acquired by “ a much larger organization ” .
The Pixelpipe website
The Pixelpipe desktop version was free and incredibly simple to use .
The homepage featured a simplistic design .
Users were given options to join or sign in at the bottom of the webpage .
Joining was simple enough .
Users could create a free account with minimal information .
Using the Pixelpipe desktop version
When clicking “ sign in ” a user was redirected to a login page .
Once the login information was submitted , the Pixelpipe dashboard was displayed .
The dashboard itself had 4 options :
• My Pipes
• Add Pipes
• Quick Post
• Settings
On the add pipes page , a user could select from some 100 platforms to incorporate into his or her feed .
When selecting a platform , the user would authorize Pixelpipe to automatically access their account .
This feature did not work with all 3rd party accounts .
For some the user was required to enter login information for that platform .
After access was granted or the login info saved , then :
• The user would create a display name for each pipe
• The user would select additional settings and options
• The details would be saved on the user ’s “ my pipes ” page
A “ pipe ” was simply a user ’s account on a 3rd party platform .
For instance , adding your Facebook account would be a pipe .
Some of the more popular choices on the add pipes page included :
• Facebook
• Flickr
• Google Docs
• Dropbox
• LinkedIn
• Shutterfly
• WordPress
• Twitter
Pixelpipe gave users some flexibility .
Users could either :
• Send posts to all pipes
• Change the settings to exclude certain pipes
• Post to a single pipe
Adjusting the default settings was more convenient than going back into the dashboard and removing ( and then re-adding ) pipes before making each post .
Another great feature was the ability to pick destination folders or albums for posts .
For example , a user could set up an album for sports cars .
Under the settings for each pipe , the user could go in and set the destination for the sports car album .
Tags could also be used to easily send content to the desired platforms and destinations .
Posting to pipes
Users could seamlessly post to all their pipes by using the quick post page .
Depending on the type of post , it was necessary to click on one of the following tabs :
• File upload
• Status / microblog
• Blog
The file upload feature was a great way to quickly add photos to each account .
Status / microblog was used for quick posts on platforms like Twitter .
The blog feature allowed users to post full blog articles on multiple platforms like WordPress and Blogger .
From this screen , each pipe that the user wished to post to could be selected by simply checking boxes at the bottom of the page .
Users could also add titles , captions , and photo tags .
After each post was submitted , the homepage would display the status for each pipe .
In the image above we see that a blog article was submitted to four different platforms : Tumblr , Livejournal , WordPress , and Blogger .
The date and time that the article was submitted on Pixelpipe is displayed at the top .
Notice that there was a slight delay for the WordPress and Blogger posts , while the Livejournal post had yet to be sent .
Depending on the pipe selected there could be a slight delay , often just a few minutes .
Pixelpipe plugins for image software
Another important feature worth mentioning was the eventual release of plugins for more advanced image software like Adobe Photoshop Lightroom .
This gave more serious and professional photographers the ability to seamlessly share their photos with their followers and customers .
The Pixelpipe Iphone App
The iPhone was the first mobile device to offer the Pixelpipe app .
The app gave users a mobile - friendly interface to post photos from anywhere .
Unique to the iPhone was the “ camera ” feature which let users take a photo and immediately send it to all desired pipes .
Using the Pixelpipe Iphone App
The app was simple to use and its design intuitive .
The interface featured 4 tabs :
• Media
• Post
• Queue
• Settings
The media tab was used to browse photos and attach them to a status update .
A typical user ’s media screen would look something like this :
Image source : https://www.iclarified.com/10411/pixelpipe-update-enables-hd-video-uploads-from-your-iphone
The tabs had the following functionalities :
• Post tab .
Used for status updates and blog posts
• Queue tab .
Showed the progress of all user uploads
• Settings tab .
Used to add , edit , and delete pipes .
The app settings functionality was like the desktop version .

Pixelpipe for Android and Nokia
Pixelpipe was one of the first services of its kind to support Android devices .
The utility was also eventually released on Nokia devices .
The release of the apps followed the tremendous success of the iPhone version .
Pixelpipe Android App
Pixelpipe ’s Android app was similar the iOS version .
The app included the same menu choices : media , post , queue , and settings .
One feature that the Android version lacked was the iPhone ’s camera feature which let users take a photo and upload it immediately .
The Android version , however , made up for this through with a feature that let users upload video and audio files , in addition to photos ( except for live capture photos ) .
One other feature that was unique to the Android version was background upload capability .
On the iPhone version , when the Pixelpipe app was closed uploads would be paused .
Android users , however , had functionality that is characteristic of contemporary smartphones .
Using the Pixelpipe Android app
Much like the iPhone and desktop utility , uploading media files to one or more pipes was simple .
The user would merely :
• Select a file
• Follow the prompts
• Enter information like the caption
• Specify the pipe
• Click “ ok ”
Here is a what a typical screen looked like when uploading a photo , in this case to Evernote :
The Android version of Pixelpipe would go on to become the company ’s most popular version .
Pixelpipe Nokia App
Pixelpipe made two different versions of its app available to users in the OVI store .
One version let users post content to their blogs .
The other version was used for posting on social media and other multimedia platforms .
Once the app was installed , the user had the option of either creating an account or signing into an existing account .
Registration for new accounts was simple , requiring some basic info like an email address and a password .
Using the Pixelpipe Nokia app
The main interface of the app was configured like the desktop version .
Clicking on the settings tab would give the user options to :
• Add pipes
• Edit pipes
• Edit tags
When the user clicked on add pipes he or she would be directed to the Pixelpipe server to select the 3rd party platform that the user wished to add .
The menu of choices would look something like this :
Like the desktop version , some of the accounts could be automatically added as pipes , while others required the user to enter login information .
Users also had the option of adding blog pages by specifying the domain address , as well as the required login credentials .
While Nokia smartphones were primitive by today ’s standards , uploading photographs from the phone ’s gallery to pipes was simple .
The user would simply :
• Go into his or her gallery
• Select a pic
• Under options the user would select “ send ”
• Select “ send via pixelpipe ”
The photo would be posted on each pipe according to the user ’s default settings for each pipe .

At a rally in Denver , CO , Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama will seize on comment by John McCain this morning on Meet the Press that he and George W. Bush share a common philosophy .
Today on Meet the Press , McCain said , “ Do I share a common philosophy of the Republican Party with George Bush ?
Sure I do . ”
Obama ’s reply will be , “ But then , just this morning , Senator McCain said that he and President Bush – “ share a common philosophy . ”
That ’s right , Colorado .
I guess that was John McCain finally giving us a little straight talk , and owning up to the fact that he and George Bush actually have a whole lot in common . ”
Then he will link McCain and Bush again , “ Well , we know what the Bush - McCain philosophy looks like .
It ’s a philosophy that says we should give more and more to folks at the top and hope that it trickles down .
It ’s a philosophy that gives tax breaks to wealthy CEOs and to corporations that ship jobs overseas while hundreds of thousands of jobs are disappearing here at home .
It ’s a philosophy that justifies spending $ 10 billion a month in Iraq while the Iraqi government sits on a huge surplus and our economy is in crisis . ”
Advertisements
Obama will also make his pitch for change , “ For eight years , we ’ve seen the Bush - McCain philosophy put our country on the wrong track , and we cannot have another four years that look just like the last eight .
It ’s time for change in Washington , and that ’s why I ’m running for President of the United States . ”
The problem that McCain has is that he ca n’t on one hand distance himself from Bush , but acknowledge that he has voted with Bush 90 % of the time .
Linking McCain to Bush and talking about the economy for the next 9 days is the winning formula for Obama .
There have two consistent truths in this race , people are sick of George W. Bush , and they are worried sick about the economy .
McCain can make his delusional claim that he is going to win this race , and I expect that the polls will tighten a bit , but a campaign that has no message or money and also seems to be at war with itself is not the type that usually pulls out comeback victories days before Election Day .
Obama ’s remarks
Posted on October 21 , 2008 in Uncategorized
From today ’s New York Times :
“ Mrs. Palin ’s negatives are up , to 41 percent now from 29 percent in September … .
Mr. Obama ’s favorability is the highest for a presidential candidate running for a first term in the last 28 years of Times / CBS polls .
Mrs. Palin ’s negative rating is the highest for a vice - presidential candidate as measured by The Times and CBS News .
Even Dan Quayle , with whom Mrs. Palin is often compared because of her age and inexperience on the national scene , was not viewed as negatively in the 1988 campaign . ”
And in a newly released Pew Poll :
In addition , Sarah Palin appears to be a continuing – if not an increasing – drag on the GOP ticket .
Currently , 49 % of voters express an unfavorable opinion of Palin , while 44 % have a favorable view .
In mid-September , favorable opinions of Palin outnumbered negative ones by 54 % to 32 % .
Women , especially women under age 50 , have become increasingly critical of Palin : 60 % now express an unfavorable view of Palin , up from 36 % in mid-September .
Notably , opinions of Palin have a greater impact on voting intentions than do opinions of Joe Biden , Obama ’s running mate .
Sarah Palin is the most disliked person of the 2008 campaign , and with good reason : she is quite possibly the dumbest and most incendiary person to be nominated for a such a high office .

David Chisnall takes a look at some of the pitfalls involved in writing secure code in C , with a guided tour of insecure code .

Use of the C programming language is often blamed for insecure code .
This is not entirely a valid accusation ; projects like OpenBSD show that it is possible to write secure code in C .
The problem with C , in this respect , is the same as the problem with assembly - language programming :
The language exposes all of the features of the architecture to you , but little else .
It provides all the features you need to write tools for secure coding , but does n't provide these tools itself .
This series will look at some of the common causes of errors in C code and how to avoid them .
Error Checking
A lot of languages these days include some mechanism for throwing exceptions .
Exceptions are generally a bad idea .
They make it hard to reason about the flow of control in a program , and have most of the disadvantages from which GOTO - filled programs suffered before the rise of structured programming .
Exceptions have one significant advantage , however :
You can't passively ignore them .
Java code , in particular , is often littered with try ... catch blocks that do nothing but discard errors , but even in this case the exception mechanism has served a purpose — it has made the programmer aware that he is n't safely handling error conditions .
In C , most functions return an invalid value when some kind of error condition exists .
This is typically done in one of two ways .
A lot of functions return an error code or zero for success .
Functions that return pointers return a valid value on success and null on failure .
This situation can be slightly confusing , since zero indicates success in some functions and failure in others .
Returning a null pointer is generally okay .
It 's not something you can ignore easily , because you 'll get a segmentation fault as soon as you try to dereference it .
This approach is really dangerous only in a function that almost never fails ; others will cause crashes during testing and be fixed .
The canonical example of a function that almost never fails is malloc ( ) , along with related functions like calloc ( ) .
The C specification says that malloc should return NULL if insufficient memory exists to satisfy the request .
Linux does n't quite obey this rule :
It returns NULL if the system does n't have enough virtual address space to satisfy an allocation , but in a case of insufficient memory Linux still allocates an address range — and then fails when you actually try to use the memory .
Assuming that you have a compliant C implementation , however , it 's worth checking malloc return values .
In most cases , there 's nothing sensible you can do if malloc fails .
Even error - recovery code typically needs to allocate some memory .
You can try allocating this memory when the program starts .
( Remember to make sure that you touch it , so lazy allocations wo n't defer the actual allocation until too late . )
Alternatively , you can use something like the following macro :
# define MALLOC ( x , y ) do { y malloc( x ) ; if ( !y ) abort ( 1 ) ; } while (0 )
This macro will test every allocation and abort the program if it fails .
You can replace the call to abort with a call to your error - handling code , but be careful .
One of the most recent vulnerabilities in OpenSSH was caused by running error - recovery code in a situation where the program was in an undefined state .
Often , terminating is the safest practice .
Checking other functions ' return values is equally important .
" What should be wrong with Ruby 's Net: HTTP implementation ? " , one might ask .
Adam Nelson was surprised by what he saw in an application that transfers huge amounts of data .
" What actually happens is the CPU redlines , and the data are transferred in 1024 byte chunks . " , Adam found out in his first analysis .
The actual problem is that " it puts a timeout around every single rbuf_fill call , " writes Alex Young , " so by default it has to spawn a new thread for every 1 K of data it intends to receive " .
A comparison between various implementations of Ruby and different libraries showed that Ruby 1.8.6 uses " twice as much CPU usage as the nearest competitor " , that is Ruby 1.8.7 , which apparently uses a larger buffer ( 16 K ) .
Interestingly , Ruby 1.9.0 has the lowest CPU usage , with an implementation that uses readpartial , " no timeout for socket reads " and " pre-allocated String buffer for each read " .
Close behind is RFuzz , a pure Ruby implementation based on the Mongrel core by Zed Shaw .
This issue is n't new , a thread on the ruby - talk mailinglist from 2006 discusses the problem and workarounds that avoid the problem for now .
In addition , this is also a good example how helpful and valuable having open source implementations can be .
I 've already discussed various electoral scenarios associated with the Bradley Effect , but I have yet to look at voter suppression .
Using foreclosure data from 2007 , the only data set I could find , a suppression model was devised .
It 's quite simple , but gives a good result ; I take the number of foreclosures in 2007 and divide that by the 2004 popular vote total in a given state .
The result represents the percentage of eligible voters [ based on 2004 ] under foreclosure .
The table below illustrates the ten states with the greatest percentage of foreclosures relative to the 2004 turnout :
Using this foreclosure percentage allows us to model a potential source of voter suppression .
If we assume that all people currently under foreclosure are voting for Obama , we can simulate what would happen if these voters were suddenly prevented from voting in their home state .
I 've taken the current projection for Obama and subtracted from that the foreclosure percentage in the given state .
The result of this calculation projects the following electoral outcome :
Notice that Ohio , Nevada , Colorado and Indiana all shifted towards McCain , which is to be expected given that we subtracted from Obama , but the model serves to verify the affect voter suppression could have on this election .
I should also mention that this " foreclosure effect " will be larger in theory than in practice due to the likely increase in voter turnout over the 2004 result .
While I was messing with the model I went ahead and ran the current Bradley Effect and Independent Slide scenarios .
We 'll start with the Bradley Effect model :
This week Obama gained 14 Electoral votes over last week 's Bradley Effect model .
Moving on to the Independent Slide model ; if all currently undecided voters suddenly moved to McCain en masse :
Obama still wins , just like last week but this time he 's added 77 Electoral Votes to his total .
Its starting to look more and more like voter suppression is the only avenue by which McCain can win .
Update : A reader asked what would happen if the Bradley Effect model were to be combined with the suppression model .
Here 's the result :
Any other suggestions ?
Besides this blog in broken English , this author is also responsible for the largest website in Portuguese dealing with UFOs , ghosts et al .
There we have a section with UFO and ghost photos analysis , which also invites visitors to send their images for evaluation .
With nearly a million pageviews a month , we do receive several images .
Most of them are honest mistakes and misinterpretations , some of them are intriguing ( which I will share here in Forgetomori soon ) , but some are not only hoaxes , but seemingly stupid hoaxes .
For your amusement , I will share a bunch of them right now .
First , we have the photo above , purportedly of UFOs in the sky .
The sender did n’t even care to remove the area around the light blue piece of card that he scanned .
That is , if you did n’t realize , that ’s just a piece of paper with some holes .
Someone actually sent that to me claiming it was a UFO photo .
More after the jump .
In the same vein , we have the photo below :
That ’s somewhat more sophisticated .
The sender wrote that he decided to take UFO photos , went outside and captured that .
There was also another image in the series , almost the same .
In the low resolution version above it ’s not that clear , but in the original ( which you do n’t want to waste your time seeing ) , it ’s easy to realize that he just photographed a wall .
A blue wall , with a hole .
Next we have the images below , two of them side by side , which were n’t sent to me directly , but rather to the CUB website :
The photographer asked if the UFO was a kite , a meteorological balloon , airplane or indeed a UFO .
First thing , if that ( other ) thing is the moon , then this alleged UFO is many times its size , with a huge angular size of several degrees .
With that brightness and appearance , it should have scared the witness or , at the very least , it could n’t be mistaken for anything but a very unusual sighting .
Then , if you simply adjust the brightness and contrast values of the original images , you get this :
The alleged UFO is always in the same relative position to some straight lines and planes that look suspiciously like part of a roof .
I do n’t know exactly what that was , perhaps a fluorescent lamp , but it ’s hardly a UFO .
Never underestimate our ability to use a simple gamma adjustment .
Then we have the following image .
The sender was not intending to perpetrate a hoax or anything , he just found this in the Internet and was intrigued :
If you do n’t see anything to be intrigued with , let me help .
In the background , there ’s a flying saucer expelling some holy smokes , either going away or just landing .
Perhaps you mistook it for a simple fountain .
We then go to the scary ghost photographs .
The sender asked what was that smoke - like ghost at his side .
It ’s obvious that ’s just a light reflection , reason why it ’s here in the lamest photos I have ever received .
That and his defiant expression .
He probably wanted to be famous , but I had the mercy to pixelize his face .
It ’s embarrassing .
I do think that the person who badly photoshopped the infamous Indonesian girl in this photo did that just to embarrass the girl .
So , we pixelized her face .
It ’s a lame ghost photo nonetheless .
Like this other Rasputian Photoshop job :
No further comments .
We also have photos which may be honest mistakes , but are boring nevertheless .
In the photo above , the only mystery is that the photographer says that there was no one there .
He may believe so honestly , but for a ghost to use casual urban outfits is somewhat lame .
Finally , as this list may be lame and boring already , we have this one :
I suspect the girl is underage , and pondered if I should censor something besides her face , but she ’s not actually showing anything .
By the way , in the mirror you can see some other girl dressed and acting like a ghost .
A ghost who wears black shorts under her white dress .
And that ’s all for now , folks .
Sometimes the lamest photos do go beyond the lameness and achieve the genius , like the best UFO photo I have ever received .
But usually they are just slightly amusing .
We may follow with more soon if you readers like this .

Disaster preparedness is about as sexy as flossing regularly , but a new alternate reality game could put the fun into contemplating the destruction of Los Angeles .
Aftershock , run by the Institute for the Future and Art Center College of Design , is based on a 300 - page U.S. Geological Survey scenario report that details the extensive damage that Southern California could experience in the aftermath of a 7.8 - magnitude quake on the San Andreas
Fault .
The game began on Thursday and will run for three weeks , prompting users to complete real - world missions — and submit content based on them to the gaming community .
" Disaster preparedness was at the point where the messaging had hit the limit .
You can give people this really elegantly designed flyer , and they stick it in a drawer and it hits them in the head during the earthquake , " said Jason Tester , the lead game designer at the IFTF .
" [ The game ] says , ' You are experiencing a real earthquake . '
We 're trying to make it feel visceral . "
The new game is part of the largest earthquake preparedness drill ever attempted , the USGS - run Great Southern Californian Shakeout .
At 10 a.m. local time Thursday , millions of Californians crawled under their desks in response to an imaginary major earthquake .
Aftershock will begin where the earthquake drill ends .
It 's not so much about what to do during an earthquake , but how to survive the fallout of the disaster .
By providing an intellectual exercise to imagine how bad an earthquake could be , Tester and his co-gamemasters hope that they 'll be able to not just increase awareness , but change people 's behavior .
Tester said that the game is an attempt to bring the reality of the so - called Big One home to a younger demographic by borrowing the tropes of gaming .
It is one of an increasing number of serious games attempting to deal with real - world problems through collaborative online action .
Last year 's World Without Oil had players imagine the world in the midst of an acute crude shortage and the IFTF 's Superstruct asks players to craft solutions to a half - dozen near - future scenarios .
" Think of the scenario as DOS , " said Jason Tester , the lead game designer at the IFTF .
" [ Aftershock ] is like the GUI to the scenario . "

Why Loud Music in Bars Increases Alcohol Consumption
At some point during the evening , in bars across the land , two things happens : the lights go down and the music goes up .
Lowering the lights signals the real beginning of night - time fun : with dimmed lights and alcohol beginning to work its magic the business of loosening up after the day ’s exertions can truly begin .
But turning the music up so loud that people are forced to shout at each other does n’t have quite the same beneficial effect on social interactions .
Because everyone is shouting , the bar becomes even noisier and soon people start to give up trying to communicate and focus on their drinking , meaning more trips to the bar , and more regrets in the morning .
Of course this is exactly what bar owners are hoping for .
People sitting around quietly nursing their drinks for hours are no good for profits .
Talkers are n’t the best drinkers .
At least that is the received wisdom in the industry .
And this received wisdom turns out to be accurate according to field studies conducted in French bars by Professor Nicolas Guegen and colleagues .
Drink up
One study by Gueguen et al. ( 2004 ) found that higher sound levels lead to people drinking more .
In a new study published in Alcoholism : Clinical & Experimental Research , Gueguen et al. ( 2008 ) visited a bar in the west of France to confirm their previous finding in a naturalistic setting .
Here , they observed customers ’ drinking habits across three Saturday nights , in two different bars in the city .
The level of the music was randomly manipulated to create the conditions of a true experiment .
It was either at its usual volume of 72 dB or turned up to 88dB .
For comparison : 72db is like the sound of traffic on a busy street while 88db is like standing next to a lawnmower .
Sure enough when the music went up the beers went down , faster .
On average bar - goers took 14.5 minutes to finish a 250 ml ( 8 oz ) glass of draught beer when the music was at its normal level .
But this came down to just 11.5 minutes when the music was turned up .
As a result , on average , during their time in the bar each participant ordered one more drink in the loud music condition than in the normal music condition .
The observers even measured the number of gulps taken to finish each drink – the level of the music was found to have no effect on this .
So the faster drinking was as a result of more gulps rather than bigger gulps .
Drinking instead of talking ?
Since the volume of the music was randomly manipulated this experiment suggests that louder music causes more drinking , but what it does n’t tell us is why .
Some think that people drink instead of talking while others have argued that they drink more because the music creates greater levels of arousal , which then leads to more drinking .
Evidence from a study carried out in pubs in Glasgow , Scotland by Forsyth and Cloonan ( 2008 ) does back up the idea that people do , at least partly , drink because they ca n’t talk to each other .
Perhaps further studies comparing lone drinkers with dyads and bigger groups would confirm or disprove this idea .
Whatever the real reason , or combination of reasons , this kind of study is very persuasive about the causal connection between louder music and more drinking because the experimenters have taken the time to go to a bar , set up the random experimental manipulation and then actually observe people to see what they do in a real live environment .
On top of that , from the point of the view of the participant , I think it would definitely enhance your night - out to find out that you ’d been inadvertently furthering psychological science by sinking a few cold ones .
Or is that just the researcher ( or beer - drinker ) in me coming out ?

A few things to consider while reading this blog
1 . When an ingredient is listed like [ this ] , it means [ this ] was the original ingredient in the recipe .
99 % of the recipes get adapted in one form or another .
2 . When Tofu is referred to , it usually means extra firm tofu , If the ( softer ) tofu in the aseptic box is used , it 'll be noted .
Boxed tofu mostly gets used in cream sauces .
Assume that we 're talking about Rice Milk , Vegan Cheese and non bone - char sugar .
3 . Links to recipes are shown when available , if there 's no link , we 'll try to cite the book / magazine issue from where it came .
If there 's no recipe cited , it usually means we made it up ... and if there 's nothing at all , enjoy the pretty pictures . ;)
4 . We do n't like ersatz food ( i.e. tofu molded into the shape of a turkey for Thanksgiving ) , but we 're funny that way .
5 . A brief personal history .
We were vegetarian for 7 years , and have been vegan for the last 20 years .

Analyst : Religious fear tactics against Obama ' beyond the pale ' David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Wednesday October 29 , 2008
Print This Email This Religious extremists have been warning their followers of the dire results that could be expected from an Obama presidency , and their accusations are reaching a point where even veteran political observers are becoming concerned .
" This stuff is just beyond the pale , " political analyst Larry Sabato told CNN .
" It 's the most negative , vicious stuff that I 've seen in quite some time . "
The conservative religious group Focus on the Family Action has sent out a " what if " letter ( pdf ) suggesting that by 2012 a Supreme Court dominated by Obama appointees could declare same - sex marriage a " ' constitutional ' right , " prohibit religious groups on college campuses , ban all Christian radio and tv broadcasts as hate speech , legalize child pornography , and restrict gun ownership .
The letter further predicts that an Obama presidency would lead to an al Qaeda takeover of Iraq , emboldened terrorists attacking four US cities , a Russian reconquest of Eastern Europe , Communist domination of Latin America , the surrender of Israel following a nuclear attack by Iran -- and , even worse , a restored Fairness Doctrine driving Rush Limbaugh off the air .
Focus on the Family Action defends its " what if " letter as legitimate political analysis , and a spokeperson told CNN , " To look with a critical eye at recent events and how they may play out in the future -- that 's not needless alarm .
I think that 's prudent . "
However , Sabato counters that " many of these conclusions are extreme and illogical .
No president would ever attempt these things .
No president who wanted to be re-elected would even think these things . "
CNN further notes that the Focus on the Family Action letter has not been the only attempt to play on religious fears .
The website of a group calling itself the Christian Anti-Defamation Commission offers " 7 Reasons Why Barack Obama is Not a Christian , " warning in apocalyptic tones that " Obama believes there are many paths to Heaven .
...
The many paths of Obama are in reality just the broad road to destruction . "
CNN concludes , however , that " while the attacks may rally religious groups , other voters are put off by the negativity . "
In a move that initially had official party backing , an email sent by Pennsylvania Republicans to 75,000 Jewish voters compared Obama 's campaign to the rise of Hitler , suggesting that " Jewish Americans cannot afford to make the wrong decision on Tuesday , November 4th , 2008 .
Many of our ancestors ignored the warning signs in the 1930s and 1940s and made a tragic mistake .
Let 's not make a similar one this year ! "
The Pennsylvania Republican party repudiated the email after it became a subject of controversy and fired the consultant who had sent it out .

ASHEVILLE , North Carolina ( Reuters ) - Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama on Monday urged the Bush administration to move swiftly to address the financial crisis , saying contagion was spreading .
“ Not only are we seeing the stock market go down but there is still a great danger of the credit markets locking up and we ’ve seen that contagion is spreading to all parts of the globe , ” Obama told reporters in Asheville , where he is preparing for Tuesday ’s debate against Republican John McCain , his rival in the November 4 election .
“ It is very important for ( Treasury ) Secretary ( Henry ) Paulson and Federal Reserve Bank Chairman ( Ben ) Bernanke to move swiftly and try to restore confidence as quickly as possible , ” Obama said .
Obama also called for a new economic stimulus package and the extension of unemployment insurance and said the government must address structural problems in the economy including in the housing market .
Congress failed to extend unemployment benefits and pass a stimulus package in a vote on September26 .
Palin supporter brings ' Obama monkey ' to campaign rally David Edwards and Andrew McLemore
Published : Sunday October 12 , 2008
Print This Email This Curious George faced a tough crowd Saturday .
A supporter of Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin outraged Democratic protesters at a rally by flaunting a toy they called racist .
The man held a stuffed monkey he named " Little Hussein . "
The toy was a Curious George doll and wore an Obama " Change " sign like a turban .
" Little Hussein wanted to see truth and good Americans , " the man said and laughed while holding the toy aloft so the Obama supporters across the street could see it .
The Democratic protesters began chanting " racist " as the man waved the doll at them .
After Palin finished her speech , the man realized a video camera was pointed at him .
He removed the Obama sign from the monkey , crumpled it in his hand , and gave the Curious George doll to a young boy , CBS reported .
The boy 's parents later said they did not know the man who had given their son the toy .
A news blogger said the man would not have " pulled his stunt at Palin 's rally " if the Alaskan governor had n't already dehumanized Obama by calling him " someone who does n't think like us . "
Rallies for McCain and Palin were marred by inflammatory speech from audience members last week , who shouted " kill him " and " terrorist " when Obama was mentioned .
McCain said he is abandoning character attacks on Obama after polls failed to shift in his favor , The Telegraph reported .

BBC News , Milan
Gino Pederzani opened his shop in Milan 's Via Montenapoleone in 1947
Police in Milan are investigating an unusual $ 1 m ( £ 628,420 ) robbery in the heart of the Italian fashion capital .
It was , said the victim , " a masterpiece of its kind " .
It was certainly daring - in broad daylight and on one of Milan 's swankiest shopping streets .
Staff at Pederzani's , one of the city 's exclusive jewellers , thought nothing amiss when a window cleaner went to work on the plate glass display .
Dressed in regulation overalls , he propped his ladder against the window .
But then , instead of using the bucket and squeegee to clean it , he calmly unscrewed it before scooping an estimated $ 1 m - worth of jewels into his bucket and walking off into the Friday shopping crowd .
This is not the first audacious crime to hit Milan 's fashion district this year .
In February robbers tunnelled their way into another top jeweller 's - escaping with almost $ 24 m - worth of gems while its owners were away entertaining Hollywood stars at the Oscars .
Good thing McCain has n’t made campaign donation ethics one of his big issues .
More from the Chicago Trib :
Big campaign donors typically come with deep pockets and influence .
But in Illinois this election cycle , no one not running for office himself has given more to the nation ’s federal campaigns than Shi Sheng Hao of Roselle , a virtual unknown in business and political circles .
Before September 2007 , Hao ’s name had never appeared in the 15 - year - old federal database of campaign contributors .
Since then , however , his donations have topped $ 120,000 — including $ 70,100 on a single June day to Republican presidential candidate John McCain .
Over the same time frame , a network of Hao relatives has kicked in more .
The take from this group over the last 13 months exceeds $ 269,000 , a small amount to Democrats but most of it to McCain and the Republican National Committee , records show .
Hao did n’t register to vote at the northwest suburban address attached to his donations until October 2007 , a month after he wrote his first political check , $ 25,000 to the RNC .
The circumstances surrounding Hao ’s sudden and prolific political activism are curious and his whereabouts unclear .
His name is n’t listed on property records or the mailbox at the unassuming tract home listed on his donations .
Hao lives “ overseas , ” insisted a man who answered the door at the Roselle home recently .
The man declined to identify himself .

In today ’s edition of Stupid Geek Tricks ( where we show off little - known tricks to impress your non-geek friends ) , we ’ll learn how to hide data in a text file that ca n’t be seen by anybody else unless they know the name of the secret compartment .
Here ’s How it Works
Ever since Windows 2000 , the NTFS file system in Windows has supported Alternate Data Streams , which allow you to store data “ behind ” a filename with the use of a stream name .
It ’s not detectable while browsing the file system , or anywhere within Windows … you can only access it with the “ secret key ” which is really just the name of the stream .
You can think of these extra streams as secret compartments within the file that can only be accessed if you know the “ secret code , ” which in this case is just the name of the stream .
This is n’t a completely secure way to hide data as we ’ll illustrate below , but it ’s a fun trick to know about in a pinch .
Note :
This only works on a drive formatted with NTFS .
Hiding Data in a Secret Compartment
In order to use this feature , you ’ll have to open a command prompt and use the following syntax :
notepad SomeFile.txt:SecretWordHere.txt
You can use anything after the colon as a secret word , the key is that there ca n’t be any spaces between the first filename and the colon .
If you did n’t specify . txt on the end , Notepad will automatically add it , and ask if you want to create a new file , even if Some File .
txt already existed , because SecretSquirrel !.
txt does n’t already exist .
Now you can enter in whatever data you want here and save the file :
When you look at the file , it will still be the exact same size as before :
You can even open up the file by double - clicking on it , and add whatever data you want to make the file look normal :
You can use the command line again to add a second hidden “ compartment ” with a different name :
You can add whatever other information to this file that you ’d like :
None of these hidden files will affect the other , or change the main file .
Just remember , you have to use the command line to access the hidden data .
Note :
Once you create a hidden stream , that stream is n’t exactly part of the file … you ca n’t copy your file to another location and access the streams over there .
Detecting Files with Streams
Of course these files are n’t completely hidden from everybody , because you can use a small command line application called Streams .
exe to detect files that have streams , including the names of the streams .
For instance , in my scenario we ’d use the following syntax :
streams.exe SomeFile.txt
As you can see , the names of the streams are shown , which would allow you to easily access them .
If you ’re using Windows 7 , you can simply use the /R argument to the DIR command to see the streams :
Deleting Streams
You can use the same Streams .
exe command to delete all streams from a file , although I do n’t think you can delete just a single stream .
Use the following syntax :
streams.exe -d SomeFile.txt
As you can see in the screenshot , the streams are now removed from the file .
Adding to Hidden Streams from the Command Line
You can add data to a hidden stream by using a number of commands , or really anything that can pipe input or output and accept the standard FileName : StreamName syntax .
For instance , we could use the echo command :
echo “ Neat ! ” > SomeFile.txt : Test
You can see with the streams command in the example above that we now have a hidden stream on the file .
Reading a Stream From the Command Line
You can read data from the stream by piping data into the more command , using this syntax :
more < FileName : StreamName
In my example the actual command was this :
more < SomeFile.txt:SecretSquirrel!.txt
As you can see , the secret data that we added is outputted to the console .
Of course , this is n’t a secure way to hide data — for that you should use TrueCrypt .
It ’s just one of those things that can be fun to use and might come in handy here or there .
Learning is fun , is n’t it ?
Our heads are still reeling from one of the most tumultuous financial weeks on record , and the auto industry was far from immune .
But despite our best efforts to drown our concerns in Racer5 IPA , the hits keep coming , and this time it 's courtesy of the New York Times .
The Gray Lady is reporting that General Motors and Chrysler have been in talks about a possible merger for the past month , that " negotiations are not certain to produce a deal , " " would most likely still take weeks to work out " and that two unnamed sources say that the chances of the merger going through are " 50 - 50 . "
Obfuscate much ?
With GM 's stock prices ending the week below $ 5 a share and Cerberus – the private equity firm that owns Chrysler – grasping at the flimsiest of straws , including continued talks with Nissan Renault , a merger of unequals is two parts disturbing and one part intriguing .
Cerberus ' people have n't been returning phone calls and the only comment offered to the NYT from the General 's spokesperson , Tony Cervone , was , " Without referencing that specific rumor , as we 've often said at GM officials routinely discuss issues of mutual interest with other automakers . "
Broad , unclear and exactly what we 'd expect .
The merger of GM and Chrysler would put Cerberus in charge of an " unspecified equity stake " in the corporation , making the two - headed General - Chrysler ( or Chrysler Motors ? ) the world 's largest automaker , controlling over 35 percent of the U.S. vehicle market , causing rifts among brand faithful and offering more potential ( vehicle ) cannibalization than the Donner Party .
Not to mention both automakers ' labor contracts , supplier dealers and slipping market share .
Shocked ?
Do n't be .
We give it a snowball 's chance on the Sun .
Thanks to ALL who tipped in .
Official statement from Lori McTavish , Executive Director , Communications , Chrysler LLC : Chrysler LLC as a matter of policy does not confirm or disclose the nature of its private business meetings .
As we have said , the Company is looking at a number of potential global partnerships as it explores growth opportunities around the world .
Beyond those partnerships already announced however , Chrysler has not formed any new agreements and has no further announcements to make at this time .

The Linux Foundation has released a report estimating the Linux kernel to be worth $ 1.4 billion , and the Fedora 9 distribution to be worth just over $ 10 billion .
The report is an update of a 2002 report estimating the worth of Red Hat Linux 7.1 ( Fedora is the community edition of Red Hat Linux , renamed in 2003 ) .
The report does n’t attempt to estimate the worth of the total Linux ecosystem , as some early speculators suggested it would , but instead sticks to the hard facts .
The estimation is an industry standard formula - based analysis of current lines of code in the Linux kernel ( 7 million ) and Fedora packages ( 200 million ) , calculating what it would cost to develop the kernel and Fedora distribution from scratch under present - day developer salaries and operating costs .
The original and updated reports both include the kernel in the calculation of the distribution as a whole , but the new report breaks out a separate figure for the kernel , highlighting its significance within the distribution .
One important perspective to carry away from this report is the astounding pace of Linux development .
The 2002 report , which used the same tools for counting lines of code , and the same formulas for calculating total cost of development , listed Red Hat Linux 7.1 as worth $ 1.2 billion .
There was some variation in the Fedora packages used for the the two reports , and for the sake of comparison the current report offers an alternate calculation using the lower operating costs of 2002 ( $ 8 billion instead of $ 10 billion ) .
Even so , we ’re looking at a distribution that ’s worth seven times what it was worth six years ago .
Averaged out , that would mean every year sees an investment of time , money , and effort roughly equivalent to the entire history of Red Hat up to 2002 .
In acknowledging the community and corporate contributions that made development of the Linux kernel and distributions possible , the report briefly touches on broader implications for open source development in general .
The companies and individuals who work on Linux - related projects and build this value proﬁt by sharing the development burden with their peers ( and sometimes competitors . )
Increasingly it ’s becoming clear that shouldering this research and development burden individually , as Microsoft has done , is an expensive approach to building software .
While monopoly position in the past has allowed them to fund this massive development , we believe that in the future competition from collaborative forces will make such an isolated position untenable .
More and more companies are turning to Linux and open source software to radically cut R&D or licensing costs .
In the current economy , that trend is sure to increase .
Bloomberg is reporting Non-Agency Mortgage Bonds Fall Amid Selling Concern .
Subprime , Alt - A and prime - jumbo mortgage securities reached or approached record lows this month as forced asset sales contributed to the decline in values .
Prices dropped to the " hi- teens to mid-20 " cents on the dollar last week on the least protected types of originally AAA rated 2006 and 2007 bonds backed by Alt - A loans with five years of fixed rates , according to a RBS Greenwich Capital report yesterday .
The bonds were at the high - 20s to mid-30s in early September .
" Super - senior " bonds fetched in the " mid-50s to mid-60s , " down from 60 to 70 cents , according to the report .
Non-agency mortgage bond prices have also fallen along with optimism about the $ 700 billion U.S. financial - market rescue plan signed into law on Oct. 3 , the report said .
Enthusiasm dimmed because the program began with capital injections into banks , instead of mortgage - asset purchases , they wrote .
Super senior securities from 2006 and 2007 created out of pools of " option " adjustable - rate mortgages dropped to 53 to 55 cents on the dollar last week , RBS said , as other types of initially AAA rated debt created from loans with growing balances were in the " low " or " very low " 20s .
The securities fell from 58 to 60 and the " mid-20s , " respectively , in early September , according to an RBS report then .
Super senior bonds are the types offering investors the most protection against defaults among the underlying loan pools .
Less protected top-rated securities from the past two years of prime - jumbo loans with five years of fixed rates traded in " hi - 40s to low 50s , " up from the " hi 30s / low 40s , " while super - senior AAAs fetched in the " low to mid-80s , " down from the mid-80s , the report said .
" It 's actually underreported how bad " demand for loans that can't be packaged into those securities has become , he said .
Issuance of subprime , Alt - A , and prime - jumbo mortgage bonds fell to $ 11 billion in the first nine months of this year , from $ 605 billion a year earlier , according to newsletter Inside MBS & ABS .
Paulson Plan Under Review
New York Times Theory
Paulson asked for taxpayer bailout money explicitly to get banks to merge .
To cover up his tracks , Paulson changed his mind three times on how to spend that money .
To guarantee the merger outcome , Paulson called all the big banks in a room , forced them to take loans at a rate that would ensure they would not want to lend it , but instead would want to use it in mergers .
Prior to the above three points , the Fed embarked on a series of lending facilities cleverly disguised to make it undesirable for banks to lend to each other or for anything else , while purporting to do the opposite .
My Theory
The economic constraints and poor policy decisions by the Fed and Treasury make mergers a better alternative than lending money or sitting in cash .

Women find scarred men attractive when looking for a fling
Harrison Ford , seen here as Indiana Jones , has a visible scar on his chin .
Researchers say western women may associate scars with health and bravery
Scars may boost a man 's sex appeal - but only if a woman is looking for a short relationship .
Women view men with scars as being adventurous , macho and brave , according to Liverpool University research .
But once a woman becomes a mother , she is likely to dump the ' bad boy ' in favour of a more caring , sharing sort .
The finding could go some way to explain the allure of film star Harrison Ford , whose scarred chin is the result of a car accident when he was in his 20s .
Academics investigated how scarring might influence how the sexes pick partners for both long - term and short - term relationships .
According to the findings , perhaps unsurprisingly , men find women with or without scars attractive .
Dr Rob Burriss , from the University of Liverpool 's School of Biological Sciences , said : ' Male and female participants were shown images of faces that displayed scarring from injury or illness , and were asked to rate how attractive they found the person for long - term and short - term relationships .
' Women may have rated scarring as an attractive quality for short - term relationships because they found it be a symbol of masculinity , a feature that is linked to high testosterone levels and an indicator of good genetic qualities that can be passed on to offspring .
' Men without scars , however , could be seen as more caring and therefore more suitable for long - term relationships .
' The results demonstrate that we may have more in common with non-Western cultures than previously thought .
' The perception that scarring is a sign of strength is a view shared by the Yanomamo tribe of Venezuela for example , who use face - paint to accentuate scars that result from ritualised club fights designed to test a man 's endurance against repeated strikes to the head .
' The assumption that scarring is a sign of bravery is also consistent with the historical tradition of academic fencing in Western culture , whereby scarring on a man was often evidence of his courage and ability to withstand an opponent 's blow . '
The research is published in the journal of Personality and Individual Differences .

Maybe this is not the second Great Depression after all .
While there is no doubt the global economy is hurting -- perhaps sliding into the worst recession since the 1970s -- investors seem to be concluding that comparisons to the dark days of the 1930s are a bit overdone .
A news database search turned up 16,095 articles that included the phrase “ Great Depression ” in the past three months , nearly triple the number of times it appeared in the previous three months .
But there are promising signs central banks are gaining some traction with their efforts to stabilize financial markets and reopen the lending taps , and the panic - selling that gripped stock markets for much of October seems to be abating .
Since October 7 , the day before major central banks announced coordinated interest rate cuts , the rates banks charge each other for overnight lending have fallen dramatically .
On October 7 , the London interbank offered rates for U.S. dollars jumped to nearly 4 percent .
As of Friday , it was down to 0.4 percent .
Libor is the benchmark used to set borrowing costs on trillions of dollars worth of lending worldwide .
“ It ’s certainly moving in the right direction , ” Jay Bryson , global economist with Wachovia , said on a conference call as he discussed the bank ’s economic outlook .
Bryson expects a global recession , probably deeper than the most recent one in 2001 .
“ Our underlying assumption is that the steps that the governments around the world have taken to date , and potentially ones that have n’t been announced yet ... will ease the global credit crunch .
There could be hiccups along the way but you wo n’t see a complete lock - down in credit markets . ”
PERKING UP
On Thursday , both the European Central Bank and the Bank of England hold interest rate - setting meetings , and both are expected to reduce short - term borrowing costs .
The U.S. Federal Reserve , Bank of Japan and People ’s Bank of China all lowered interest rates last week .
With the rate cuts , government steps to shore up banks and guarantee loans , and programs to get hard currency into emerging markets , credit is starting to flow again .
Issuance of commercial paper , a form of debt that companies use to finance day - to - day business , grew last week after six consecutive weeks of declines .
To be sure , that was largely because the Federal Reserve launched a new program to buy the paper , and private investors have yet to show much enthusiasm .
The U.S. central bank and the International Monetary Fund also opened up new lending channels last week to get dollars and other hard currencies into key emerging economies .
That helped to lift stock markets in countries such as Brazil .
There were also some reassuring comments from the corporate world .
Starbucks Corp SBUX.O said sales at its established stores edged up in October , and it was hopeful that it had weathered the worst of the slowdown .
UGLY PRICED IN ?
As of Friday , nearly two - thirds of the companies in the U.S. Standard and Poor ’s 500 index had reported quarterly earnings , and 60 percent of them posted results that were better than analysts expected , according to Thomson Reuters data .
Of course , earnings were down 11.7 percent on average .
The message from those companies was that the U.S. economy is tilting into a recession that some CEOs say will be the worst since the 1970s .
But they do not expect catastrophic job losses and bank failures on a par with the Depression era .
“ For the time being , investors appear to be more focused -- and cheerful -- over the slate of global policy announcements and the ensuing impact of breaking the logjam in the money and credit markets than on the continuous set of very weak incoming economic data , not just here but abroad , ” said Merrill Lynch economist David Rosenberg .
“ Either a deep and prolonged recession has already long been discounted , or financial market participants are going to be in for a very big surprise because the economic data , as ugly as they are , are likely to get a lot uglier in coming months and quarters , ” he said .
The next unpleasant surprises may come this week .
Euro - zone retail sales for September are expected to show a decline , and the global manufacturing sector probably contracted last month .
U.S. retailers are expected to report weak sales for October , and the U.S. October employment report may show job losses nearing the 200,000 mark .
As depressing as those figures may sound , they are consistent with a recession , not a depression .
The commonly cited rule of thumb for determining when a garden variety recession becomes something much worse is a 10 percent drop in GDP .
Not even bearish economists are predicting that .
In 1988 , Congress banned video stores from disclosing the titles of films that people rent .
The issue arose because in the battle to block Robert Bork from the Supreme Court , someone leaked his video rentals .

Amoebas glide toward their prey with the help of a protein switch that controls a molecular compass , biologists at the University of California , San Diego have discovered .
Their finding , recently detailed in the journal Current Biology , is important because the same molecular switch is shared by humans and other vertebrates to help immune cells locate the sites of infections .
The amoeba Dictyostelium finds bacteria by scent and moves toward its meal by assembling a molecular motor on its leading edge .
The active form of a protein called Ras sets off a cascade of signals to start up that motor , but what controlled Ras was unknown .
Richard Firtel , professor of biology along with graduate student Sheng Zhang and postdoctoral fellow Pascale Charest tested seven suspect proteins by disrupting their genes .
One called NF1 , which matches a human protein , proved critical to chemical navigation .
NF1 turns Ras off .
Without this switch mutant amoebas extended false feet called pseudopodia in all directions and wandered aimlessly as Ras flickered on and off at random points on their surfaces .
“ You have to orient Ras in order to drive your cell in the right direction , ” Firtel said .
In contrast , normal amoebas with working versions of NF1 elongate in a single direction and head straight for the most intense concentration of bacterial chemicals , the team reports .
The biochemical components of the system match those found in vertebrate immune cells called neutrophils that hunt down bacterial invaders , suggesting that the switch might be a key navigational control for many types of cells , Firtel said .
“ The pathway and responses are very similar and so are the molecules . ”
The US Public Health Service funded this work .

In the books , Bond is suave and sophisticated , yes … but there ’s also a flawed aspect of Bond .
In the novels he is quite a depressive character .
When he ’s not working , he ’s at his worst … I can relate . ”
“ Quantum Of Solace ” will hit domestic theaters on November 14th 2008 .
Speaking to Playboy magazine , actorhas revealed that despite the fact that he signed a contract for a total of fourfilms , he is not sure that he will return for the third installment .
Craig said that where he goes from here depends on “ .
” Re-reading Ian Fleming ’s James Bond books made movie hunk Daniel Craig broody and miserable – and that was a good thing .
The British stud , who first played 007 in Casino Royale , is back for more Bond in new film Quantum of Solace – and he wanted to portray the darker side of the suave superspy .
Craig recalled reading the books when he was younger and finding Bond a workaholic depressive – and that ’s the character he wanted to channel in the latest adventure .
He tells : Picking up an hour after the end of “ “ , “ Quantum of Solace ” resolves around the new adventures of the super spy in a manipulative and dangerous mission of uncovering the truth behind the organization which blackmailed his former lover Vesper Lynd .
Fighting the urge to avenge his broken heart , he plunges into the mission that brings him almost around the world and finds out that the organization is more complex and dangerous as his enemy is seeking to dominate one of the world ’s most important natural resources .

It will get its world premiere in London on October 29 which is said to be attended by Prince William and Prince Harry .
Daniel Craig as James Bond
The developing world 's ever - growing demand for computers , particularly in the BRIC ( Brazil , Russia , India , and China ) countries , has been a major factor in the steady growth of US OEMs and the IT industry .
As the market for new PCs has expanded in developing nations , there has been a corresponding increase in the demand for recycled systems ( also called " secondary " PCs ) .
Theoretically , this secondary market should be adequately supplied , given that there 's no shortage of used PCs , but research suggests that this is not the case .
According to new research from Gartner , only 44 percent of the PCs that enter the secondary market are actually redeployed in a new setting .
That figure does n't apply to all the various computers that are trashed or end up in landfills ; it 's strictly defined as a measurement of how many of the systems meant for repurposing actually end up repurposed .
Gartner defines a secondary / recycled PC as any system that was purchased and used for at least three months before being passed on to someone else .
Despite the relatively low redeployment rate , so - called secondary PCs account for a significant percentage ( possibly up to 20 percent ) of the computers currently in use worldwide .
Gartner does n't mention it in today 's report , but the current 44 percent redeployment rate is up 22 percent from the 36 percent reuse rate the firm measured in 2005 .
Question is , what 's keeping the percentage of redeployed systems so low ?
As it turns out , a lot of things , most of which have n't changed from 2005 to 2008 .
Profitability is n't a problem ; Gartner estimates an average profit margin of $ 10 - $ 50 on repurposed systems .
Unfortunately , take one step past the question of whether or not the repurporsed PC business is viable and almost everything becomes a mess .
The rules and regulations on the distribution and sale of such systems vary from country to country , as do the terms and conditions companies are required to sell the systems under .
Not all recycled PCs are equally valuable or equally desired .
Businesses purchasing a significant number of secondary systems prefer to buy a bulk quantity of the same system model , just as companies do when buying new .
OEM - branded PCs are also more valuable if they still carry a licensing sticker affixed by the original reseller ; Gartner states that these stickers provide a certain claim to legitimacy in the event of a Redmond - sponsored audit .
Rising transportation costs and laws requiring additional vendor responsibility have eliminated some of the smaller companies reselling these systems , but Gartner notes that the market is still extremely fragmented , with " tens of thousands of players . "
The chief exporters of said PCs are North America , Western Europe , Japan , and Australia , while the primary importers are the MEA countries ( Middle East and Africa ) and the Asia / Pacific markets — China , in particular .
Gartner 's report highlights how vital secondary systems are to bringing countries online and providing basic computer services , but there 's an elephant in the living room that the company does n't mention .
If just 44 percent of the systems entering the market are reused , and we know that number is higher ( in both real and percentage terms ) than it was three years ago , what 's happening to the majority of the systems that do n't make it to secondary deployment ?
Obviously they fall out of the chain at some point , but where and why is this occurring ?
I think we can make a few assumptions .
Not every PC that enters the secondary supply chain is going to be suitable for reuse , due to age , hardware failure , or licensing issues that give a conscientious vendor pause .
It seems likely that some of the PCs designated for reuse actually end up being broken down and used for parts .
Alternatively , the various components of a system may end up resold individually through eBay or another auction site .
If you 've got enough of them , even cases might be worth something — I do n't know what metal recyclers are paying for scrap aluminum and steel these days , but a few hundred ( or a few thousand ) individual systems is an awful lot of metal .
The breakdown process does n't stop once the secondary systems hit their destination countries ; local resellers presumably break down system models that do n't sell well in order to repair those that do .
It seems reasonable to assume that these processes could account for a significant number of secondary systems not reaching the redeployment phase , but not 56 percent of them .
Whatever computers are n't accounted for as sold or scrapped are apparently lost to theft , the black market , or the chop shops of China , where circuit boards are melted down for scrap metal .
Probably not what Dr. Spock would consider an ideal playspace
Stories about back - alley chop shops and the citizens ( some of whom are children ) who labor there , exposed to toxic chemicals with no form of safety gear , have fueled calls for increased vendor responsibility and oversight on these matters , but it 's extraordinarily difficult for any OEM — even Dell or HP — to secure a secondary PC recycling channel end - to - end without actually owning / operating the entire network .
Companies could presumably undertake this sort of operation , but it would undoubtedly drive up the cost of secondary PCs when those systems already serve areas that can't afford to buy new .
Ed Schafer , US Secretary of Agriculture , seems to think we need to bail out the ethanol industry :
Agriculture Secretary Ed Schafer ’s statement on Oct. 17 that the U.S. Department of Agriculture could provide ethanol companies that got into trouble by speculating on corn with up to $ 25 million per company in refinancing has caused a firestorm of criticism among ethanol critics who say he is favoring one segment of agriculture and might waste taxpayer money .
…
According to a report on Agweb.com , Schafer said at the World Food Prize symposium in Des Moines , Iowa , “ There ’s going to have to be some credit applied to companies to buy some lower - priced corn to blend with their higher - priced corn .
This is important public policy for the country because corn- based ethanol is a stepping stone to energy independence through cellulosic ethanol .
We ’re going to continue to support it as much as we can .
We have the responsibility to make sure we cement in the infrastructure of rural America and ethanol production has increased the economic opportunities , the jobs and the building of rural America . ”
One ca n’t claim that these companies are “ too big to fail ” or that their failure will endanger our entire economy .
One ca n’t claim , with any sense of honesty , that the ethanol experiment has really done much positive for America .
In reality , one ca n’t say a good word about this mess .
Which just proves , once again , that government is more than willing to engage in theft of tax dollars and redistribution to industry in order to satisfy the politically - correct goal of the day .
And nobody will stand up to them …
Scratch that – nearly nobody :
Ethanol plants may be the next beneficiary of a federal bailout and Mesa congressman Jeff Flake is among those opposed to that idea . …
Flake , a fiscal conservative , panned the plan Wednesday saying federal promotion of ethanol production is the problem .
“ The federal government ’s ethanol policies have driven up the price of corn , ” said Flake .
“ But rather than reforming the policies that have caused a spike in corn prices , the federal government wants to bail out ethanol producers who speculated on the price of corn .
Only the U.S. Department of Agriculture could dream up a policy like this . ”
Flake said tax breaks and credits for ethanol producers should be repealed .
“ The high price of corn has had a ripple effect over our entire economy .
Instead of trying to bail out every industry hurt by it , the federal government needs to take a serious look at reforming our ethanol policies , ” said the East Valley Republican .
I ’m never one to look to Congress to solve my problems ; nor do I think that elections are likely to improve our collective lot .
But it ’s good to see someone who wishes to stand athwart the tide , and I ca n’t say I ’d mind seeing a few more like him .

Pakistan delivered a blunt message yesterday to America 's new military commander for the region , warning General David Petraeus on his first international trip since taking the job that US missile strikes inside Pakistan must stop .
Petraeus , credited with pulling Iraq back from the brink , pointedly made Pakistan his first visit to the region , after last week assuming overall command of the Middle East and Central Asia , including Iraq and Afghanistan .
Pakistan 's co-operation is considered vital if the Taliban insurgency in Afghanistan is to be quelled , but Islamabad has been incensed by US missile attacks inside its territory against suspected militants .
" Continuing drone attacks on our territory , which result in loss of precious lives and property , are counterproductive and difficult to explain by a democratically - elected government .
It is creating a credibility gap , " Pakistan 's president Asif Zardari told Petraeus , according to a statement issued by the president 's office .
Petraeus also held meetings yesterday with Pakistani army chief Ashfaq Kayani and defence minister Ahmad Mukhtar , in which a similar message was reportedly conveyed .
However , the strikes , which have intensified greatly over the past two months , killing dozens and causing uproar in Pakistan , are expected to go on .
Before 9/11 Pakistan had backed the Taliban government in Kabul , and its all - powerful army is believed to still support elements within the Taliban , seeing the Karzai government as allied with arch - enemy India .
" Pakistan has been targeting different Taliban factions than the US , " said Farrukh Saleem , executive director of the Centre for Research and Security Studies , a thinktank based in Islamabad .
" Pakistan is being encircled .
There are Indian troops in the east , and Nato , the US and the Afghan national army to the west . "
Analysts believe that the missile attacks are damaging an already weak civilian government in Islamabad , following the restoration of democracy earlier this year after more than eight years of military rule , providing an opening that anti-American Islamist politicians can exploit .
Last year Petraeus instigated a fresh approach in Iraq , with a " surge " of thousands of extra US troops and a successful ploy of separating the Sunni nationalist insurgents from al - Qaida , by turning the Iraqi Sunni Muslims against the global jihadists inspired by Osama bin Laden .
In Afghanistan the two key tenets of this counter - insurgency strategy are expected to be replicated .
" Petraeus does understand that , while the basic template from Iraq is applicable in Afghanistan and Pakistan , there are many differences , " said Kamran Bokhari , director of Middle East analysis at Stratfor , a private US geopolitical intelligence firm .
" The key difference is that Iraq was a sectarian conflict . "
Petraeus used the threat of Shia Muslim dominance in Iraq to entice the Sunnis into the mainstream , whereas there are already large Sunni majorities in Afghanistan and Pakistan .
Washington and Kabul are starting to engage in tentative talks with figures associated with the Afghan Taliban , but past attempts at winning over " moderate " Taliban have failed .
The US general will soon have a new boss following the US presidential election , with both candidates pledging to focus on Afghanistan and provide more troops , especially Barack Obama , who has repeatedly said that Afghanistan and Pakistan is where the fight against terrorism must be won .
This afternoon , Barack Obama spoke at a campaign event in Green Bay , Wisconsin .
He touched on the only true news of importance at the moment : the wobbling of that house of cards called Wall Street .
With a $ 700 billion band - aid being positioned to cover the problem , that puts investment bank ’s bad deals on the backs of United States taxpayers , Barack Obama ’s stance is it ’s a situation that must be handled , but he ’s not in favor of a blank check ..
“ If we grant the Treasury broad authority to address the immediate crisis , we must insist on independent accountability and oversight .
Given the breach of trust we have seen and the magnitude of the taxpayer money involved , there can be no blank check . ”
He continued with a six point plan to solve the crisis .
If you ’re a financial institution that can borrow from the government , you should be subject to government oversight and supervision .
Taxpayers who have now been called upon to spend nearly a trillion dollars to save our economy from the excesses of Wall Street have every right to expect that financial institutions are not taking excessive risks .
We need to reform requirements on all regulated financial institutions , investigate rating agencies and potential conflicts of interest with the people they are rating , and establish transparency requirements that demand full disclosure by financial institutions to shareholders .
We need to streamline our overlapping and competing regulatory agencies that cannot oversee the large and complex institutions that dominate the financial landscape .
We need to regulate institutions for what they do , not what they are .
Over the last few years , commercial banks and thrift institutions were subject to guidelines on subprime mortgages that did not apply to mortgage brokers and companies .
This regulatory framework failed to protect homeowners , and made no sense for our financial system .
We need to crack down on trading activity that crosses the line to market manipulation .
We need regulators that actually enforce the rules instead of overlooking them .
The SEC should investigate and punish all market manipulation .
We must establish a process that identifies systemic risks to the financial system like the crisis that has overtaken our economy .
We need a standing financial market advisory group to meet regularly and provide advice to the President , Congress , and regulators on the state of our financial markets and the risks they face .
It ’s time to anticipate risks before they erupt into a full - blown crisis .
Yesterday , on the other side of the country , Sarah Palin ( not John McCain ) drew 60,000 people to a rally in Florida .
Anything about the economy ?
Let ’s see ..
“ Americans are caught in kind of a perfect storm between high taxes , high gas prices , greed on Wall Street and a shortage of courage in Washington .
But we need new leadership in Washington — we need serious reform on Wall Street . ”
Compare those two solutions to the economic problem and vote accordingly .
The Lazy Beginning Reverser 's Guide to Windows Assembly
by Vortex168 A beginner - level tutorial , which will teach you the basics of ASM and how they work under Windoze .
This is almost making me want to crack something again ... ;)
The Lazy Beginning Reverser 's Guide to Windows Assembly ---------------- |
Introduction |
----------------
I'm vortex168 and this is a guide to Windows Assembly for beginning reversers .
It 's for lazy people because it's a barebones crashcourse in Windows Assembly that covers what you will definitely need to know in order to properly ' modify ' a disassembled program ( not understand it ) .
And it 's for beginners , so for those of you that get bored , you have only yourselves to blame = ) .
You should not have trouble understanding this guide as long as you have a logical brain .
The more programming knowledge you have the easier it will be to pick up Windows Assembly .
It should be noted that after this guide , it is highly recommended that the reader read some of the other , more complete Windows Assembly guides / books because the more you know , the easier it is to understand a disassembled program .
Without further ado , let the guide begin !
Before you begin = ) , try to understand what hexadecimal ( hex ) is .
If you 're THAT lazy and do n't want to until later , suffice to say , just think of them as numbers , but do n't try to add / subtract / multiply / divide them , because your answer will probably be wrong .
This type of number is distinguished from your everyday number ( decimal ) because it will have an 'h ' at the end of it ( eg. 1230h ) .
* Extra Note : Do n't read the Extra Notes if you do n't feel like it .
They are n't essential ... not really = ) .
Semicolons are the symbol that tells the assembler ( the thing that puts together a program written in Assembly ) not to bother with anything past it .
So , on the same line , everything after the ' ; ' is ignored and is known by programmers as a ' comment ' .
--------------------------------------- |
Part 1 : Registers , Flags , The Stack |
---------------------------------------
--REGISTERS--
Think of registers as a fancy term for 32 - bit ( it 's just a size , calm down if you do n't understand , it does n't matter all that much at this point ) variables .
You use them exactly as you would use any other variables , to store values that you will need later on .
For those who are n't quite as lazy as some others , here is a quick run-through of the registers that you will see while reversing a Windows32 program ( as opposed to a DOS one ) : ( This can be skipped if you are that short on time ) General Purpose Registers : EAX - Commonly used in mathematical operations EBX - Commonly used as a pointer ( if you do n't know what this is , do n't worry , it does n't matter that much right now ) ECX - Commonly used as a looping variable ( eg. it stores the value ' 5 ' if a loop needs to run 5 times ) EDX - Similar to EBX Registers that you should NOT touch if you do n't know what you 're doing : CS - ' Code segment ' .
Basically tells you where you are in memory ( think of it as part of the address that tells you where in your computer the program is stored ) DS - ' Data segment ' .
Same as above , but tells you where the data is stored ( eg. strings ) ES - ' Extra segment ' .
Ask someone else what the hell this does , I 've never messed with it = ) .
SS - ' Stack segment ' .
( See Above ) ESI - ' Source Index ' .
( See Above ) EDI - ' Destination Index ' .
( See Above ) EBP - ' Base Pointer ' .
( See Above ) ESP - ' Stack Pointer ' .
( See Above ) EIP - ' Instruction Pointer ' .
I know this one = ) .
It holds the address of the next instruction .
By now you should realize that I do n't know everything about Assembly .
Why ?
Because I understand your laziness much better than you might think = ) .
* Extra Note :
The ' E ' in front of some of the register names just indicates it is a 32 - bit version of the register to distinguish it from their 16 - bit counterparts that were used in DOS and other 16 - bit processors .
Each of the General Purpose Registers can be broken down into parts .
For example , 'EAX 's lower half is ' AX ' .
' AX ' can be divided into ' AH ' and ' AL ' .
AH is the ' high ' half of AX , and AL is the ' low ' half of AL .
-- FLAGS --
Does n't deserve a whole Part since I 'm not saying much about it because you do n't mess with these much anyway .
The only thing I want to point out is that in Debuggers , aside from the program code and values of the abovementioned registers , there is also a set of single letters that are ( depending on what you use , it 'll be represented differently ) either highlighted or not highlighted .
These are ' flags ' that basically store TRUE or FALSE .
The most important one to know is the Zero flag .
It 's obviously the ' Z ' .
It 's use will be seen when jumps are explained later .
-- THE STACK --
The stack is basically your computer 's warehouse .
It can be used to store anything .
Why do people bother with registers ?
Because they 're a lot faster and easier to deal with .
In order to properly introduce the stack , I will need to tell you about your first two assembly instructions .
Push and Pop. Learn to love them , or at least tolerate them because you 'll be seeing a LOT of them .
The stack , as it's name implies , operates like a stack of plates .
Information gets Push'ed on the stack of plates and if you want to get information off of the stack , you Pop it off the top .
As you have probably realized , it is a FILO ( first in last out ) scheme , meaning that information that gets pushed onto the stack first will be the last to get popped off .
( if you get the point , skip the example ) Example : push 1h ; put the value ' 1 ' on the stack push 2h ; put the value ' 2 ' on the stack push 3h ; put the value ' 3 ' on the stack pop eax ; take off the top value ( 3 ) and put it into ; eax pop ebx ; take off the top value ( now it is 2 , ; because 3 got taken already ) and put it ; into ebx pop ecx ; take off teh top value ( now 1 ) and put it ; into ecx ---------------------------------------- |
Part II : Basic Assembly Instructions |
----------------------------------------
This is a list of the most common Assembly instructions that a reverser at your current level ( which should be far below NEWB ) will need to understand .
If you deal with tougher programs , they might use some weird functions , which is why you should grab yourself a handy reference guide when you get around to it .
Find it yourself you lazy bum .
We have already discussed two instructions , Push and Pop , so we begin from there : MOV - um ... it moves stuff around = ) .
Example : mov eax , 203h
This line moves the value 203 hex into the EAX register .
Mathematically it looks like this : X = 203h where X is just the EAX register .
If you still do n't understand , go back to school .
CALL - it calls the function located at the given address .
Example : call 03828549 ;
This is what it will look like in ; a disassembly .
;
When actually programming in ; Assembly , tags can be used instead ; ( eg. call my_function ) .
This line calls the function at the address 03828549 .
* Extra note :
If this line of code were located at address 02955555 , this address would be stored on top of the stack to let the program know where to go back to .
JMP - unconditional jump , it jumps the program to whatever address it is told to , skipping everything between .
Example : jmp 00300000 ; assume this line is located at ; 00200000 push eax ; thus this line is at 002XXXXX ( yes ; i could tell you where exactly , ... ; but you do n't need to know ) .
It is ; not executed because of the jump ; above .
push ebp ;
If this instruction is at address ; 00300000 , it gets executed after ; the jump .
CMP - compare two values .
Essentially subtracts the 2nd from the first and throws away the result .
BUT !
It sets a TON of flags that are almost always used in conjunction with a conditional jump of some type .
If the two values are equal , then the subtraction will equal zero and the Zero flag will be set ( will be TRUE ) .
The carry , overflow , sign , and a couple other flags may get set / unset as a result of the cmp function as well , so many different types of conditional jumps can be used after a compare .
JNZ / JZ - conditional jumps , two of many many possible types ( eg. JG ( greater than ) , JL ( less than ) , JGE , JNG , etc. ) these two are more common , Jump if not Zero and Jump if Zero .
These check the zero flag which was mentioned earlier .
If the zero flag is set , then the JZ jump gets taken and the JNZ does not .
Very important for any reverser / cracker because it dictates the flow of the program and often comes after a cmp of two values ( say , maybe the serial number you enter and the one that it 's supposed to be ? = P ) .
If the jump is not taken , the program simply continues on with the next instruction after the jump .
RET - return , tells the program that it has completed a routine ( function ) and needs to return to where it came from .
* Extra Note :
For more complete information about the above topics , search around for Cruehead 's Assembly tutorials on the internet .
They 're good ... they 're just a lot longer than mine = ) .
--------------------------------------- |
Part III : The Windows API Functions |
---------------------------------------
Every Windows program ( um , I think ) makes use of the Windows API functions at some level .
These are a bunch of functions that do all the useful stuff you would need to do in a Windows program ( ie. get a string , make a message box , etc . ) .
In a disassembly of a program , you will see many calls to API functions .
As for any call , the parameters ( fancy word for ' inputs ' ) for the function are first push 'ed on to the stack .
So it would look something like this : push input2 push input1 call FunctionThatTakes2Inputs
Notice that the 2nd input is pushed and THEN the first input is pushed .
This is because things pushed onto the stack get put on top of one another and we want the top item on the stack to be the first input when we call the function .
So while trying to understand a portion of code , pay attention to why things are being push 'ed on to the stack because chances are you will need to know what values are getting thrown around by the program ( say , perhaps if a function takes two inputs , one being your name and the other your company , what do you think will happen ? ) .
I 'd highly suggest you get yourself an API reference so that you can look up any unfamiliar API functions .
It will help greatly when trying to actually understand a program and you forget what the 2nd input of the MessageBoxA function is supposed to be .
The following is a list of some of the more cracker - oriented API functions ( not reverser - oriented because a reverser needs to know them all if he / she wants to understand a program completely , which is the difference between the two ) .
GetWindowText : ~~~~~~~~~~~~~ int GetWindowText ( HWND hWnd , // handle of window or control with text LPTSTR lpString , // address of buffer for text int nMaxCount // maximum number of characters to copy ) ; Parameters : hWnd - Identifies the window or control containing the text .
lpString - Points to the buffer that will receive the text .
nMaxCount - Specifies the maximum number of characters to copy to the buffer .
If the text exceeds this limit , it is truncated .
* Extra Note :
For those unfamiliar with the C programming language , the above bit is a function definition for the GetWindowText function .
The 'int ' right before the GetWindowText indicates that the function will return an integer value after it is completed .
This translates into plain english as ' GetWindowText hands whoever called it some number ' .
The three lines between the parenthases are the inputs that the function will take .
Each line is one type of input and the HWND is the TYPE of input while the hWnd is just the name that the function has decided to use for the input .
The same goes for the rest of it .
This function is used to , duh , get text from a window .
The ' handle ' of a window is kind of like the name that Windows uses to recognize the window ( ' window ' is , in this case , equal to ' program ' ) .
In your disassemblies , this will be some address that is assigned to the program at the very beginning of the program .
When simply cracking , you do n't really need to worry about this , just know that it is the last parameter that will be pushed right before the call to this function .
The most important of these parameters is the second one .
This is the address that the retrieved string will be stored in .
Here is an example : push 00000016 ; max length of 16h characters ( 22 characters ) push 00493938 ; retrieved string will be stored at address 00493938 push 00482638 ; handle of window call GetWindowText
So now you know that the string it is retrieving will be at address 00493938 and that any future reference ( unless it gets replaced with something else ) to this address will be referring to the text that was retrieved by the function .
GetDlgItemText : ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
UINT GetDlgItemText ( HWND hDlg , // handle of dialog box int nIDDlgItem , // identifier of control LPTSTR lpString , // address of buffer for text int nMaxCount // maximum size of string ) ; Parameters : hDlg - Identifies the dialog box that contains the control .
nIDDlgItem - Specifies the identifier of the control whose title or text is to be retrieved .
lpString - Points to the buffer to receive the title or text .
nMaxCount - Specifies the maximum length , in characters , of the string to be copied to the buffer pointed to by lpString .
If the length of the string exceeds the limit , the string is truncated .
This function is used to do the same as above , but under different circumstances .
Go find out the difference between the two yourself if you are that hardworking , it has to do with the difference between a ' window ' and a ' dialog ' .
MessageBox : ~~~~~~~~~~~ int MessageBox ( HWND hWnd , // handle of owner window LPCTSTR lpText , // address of text in message box LPCTSTR lpCaption , // address of title of message box UINT uType // style of message box ) ; Parameters : hWnd - Identifies the owner window of the message box to be created .
If this parameter is NULL , the message box has no owner window .
lpText - Points to a null - terminated string containing the message to be displayed .
lpCaption - Points to a null - terminated string used for the dialog box title .
If this parameter is NULL , the default title Error is used .
uType - Specifies a set of bit flags that determine the contents and behavior of the dialog box .
This parameter can be a combination of flags from the following groups of flags .
I have cut off the ' groups of flags ' because it was a long list .
This function creates a message box .
You see these all the time and they are often used to make the annoying ' you have 30 days left in your trial ' messages that pop up for shareware .
The last parameter ( uType ) basically tells what buttons are in the message box .
So sometimes you see a message box with Abort , Retry , and Ignore .
Other times you see a box with Ok and Cancel. etc. etc .
That 's what this parameter does .
If you look up the MessageBox function in a Win32 Programmer 's reference , it will give you a list of the valid values .

July 2002 vortex168
Ever since the economy really began to weaken and gas prices approached $ 3 / gallon and then $ 2 / gallon , there has been much commentary on businesses making cutbacks and slowing their implementation of sustainability efforts .
I have written that this time of economic crisis will separate the companies that are truly committed to good environmental stewardship from those that were only interested in making green efforts while the economy was strong .
During the presidential campaign , both candidates made renewable energy investments central pieces of their legislative agendas , employing images of wind turbines and solar panels in their TV ads and stump speeches .
However , since the credit crisis exploded and energy prices plummeted , even a pioneer like T. Booke Pickens , who spent tens of millions of dollars over the last few months advocating for public support of wind power , has delayed his landmark project .
The New York Times ran a story on Tuesday , 11 / 24 , about how the “ economic slump and plunging prices of coal and oil are upending plans to wean businesses and consumers from fossil fuel . ”
My hope is that the U.S. Government , under the leadership of President Barack Obama , does not give up on its efforts to wean our country off oil , most of which comes from foreign sources .
I was encouraged by a message that Obama recorded last week for the Governors ’ Global Climate Summit .
In his message , Obama states , “ Climate change and our dependence on foreign oil , if left unaddressed , will continue to weaken our economy and threaten our national security . ”
He goes on to say that his goal is to reduce the United States ’ emissions of greenhouse gases by 80 % by 2050 .
He also committed to investing $ 15 b each year on alternative energy , which he said will not only help to reduce our use of oil , but will also help create up to 5 million new jobs .
Regardless of the accuracy of the jobs figure , I hope that the U.S. sticks to this plan , and does not use low gas prices and a difficult economy as an excuse for inaction .
We should look towards Brazil as an example of how a country makes energy independence a goal and sticks to that plan , regardless of the economic circumstances .
Here ’s a great story from the Wall Street Journal in 2006 which summarizes Brazil ’s sugar ethanol industry development .
I remember looking for some energy provider myself ( so come up with the OVO contact number ) and later – reading this in an airport almost three years ago and was able to find a free link on Yale ’s website – I found the piece so interesting , and wanted to share it with you .
The moral of the story for me is that we have learned our lesson from our addiction to oil – from the recent price spikes , as well as the fact that it supports dangerous regimes that hate America ( not to mention the negative environmental impact of fossil fuels ) , and we need to make a change .
It will cost a lot of money and require sacrifice , but it is one of the greatest issues of our time and must be addressed .

Kuiper belt free of Pluto pups
An astronomical survey searching for small , icy bodies circling in the far reaches of the solar system has come up empty - handed .
After a two year serach , the Taiwanese - American Occultation Survey ( TAOS ) , has concluded that there are no miniature sized plutoids - between three and 27 kilometres in diameter - in the Kuiper Belt objects .
TAOS has been watching for tiny flickers of light as small KBOs eclipsed background stars , a technique scientists thought would reveal objects too tiny to be spotted directly .
The survey accumulated more than 200 hours of data studying light from between 200 and 2000 stars simultaneously , but failed to detect any flickers .
Scientists suspect the dearth of small objects may be because bodies of that size have already clumped together to form larger bodies , or because frequent collisions have broken down the objects into even smaller bodies that fall below the survey 's detection level .
" The main thing that 's needed is just more time on the sky , " says Dr Tim Axelrod , an astronomer with University of Arizona 's Steward Observatory in Tucson and co-author of a paper appearing in this month 's Astrophysical Journal Letters .
Scientists hope additional studies with larger telescopes and faster cameras will further define what the KBO population looks like .
Kuiper belt
The Kuiper belt , which is the area of the solar system beyond Neptune 's orbit , includes a few large bodies , such as the dwarf planet Pluto and the recently discovered Haumea and Makemake .
It is also home to about 1000 smaller objects that orbit between 30 and 55 times as far from the sun as earth .
The size distribution is uncertain because most reflect too little sunlight to be seen with today 's technology .
That may change as new , large observatories , such as the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope , are put into service , says Axelrod , who is developing software systems for the observatory .
" TAOS is one of the first surveys of what will probably be several generations of experiments , " he says .
Scientists are eager to learn more about objects in the Kuiper Belt in hopes of improving understanding of how the solar system came into existence .
" The objects that are way out in the Kuiper Belt are of interest largely because they have not evolved very much dynamically like things in the inner solar system , " Axelrod says .
" They tell what the nature of the disk out of which all the planets formed . "

Loo with a view :
The world 's toilets with the best vistas
We may not really care what our view is when we use the loo .
But maybe we should - for according to the World Toilet Organisation we spend three years of our lives on the throne .
And that fact was enough to set author Luke Barclay off on a mission to flush out the planet 's best loos with a view .
Boston Bay High Camp , Washington state :
Few loos with a view can beat this one near Johannesburg Mountain in the North Cascades national park
Canton de Chelly , Arizona : A wooden loo at the base of Spider Rock , an 800ft sandstone spire revered by Navajo Indians
The Valley of Longevity , Ecuador : A wooden long - drop that lives up to its description , high in the Andes
Cliff - Top Chateau , France :
This ' oasis of pis ' overlooks a picturesque bend in the Dordogne River
Among them are remote wilderness loos , such as the ones at Salar de Uyuni in Bolivia and the Boulder Pass Campsite in Montana , which overlooks the spectacular Agassiz Glacier .
Many are on sacred sites - including those in the Valley of Longevity in Ecuador , where locals are said to live to 135 , and on Mount Sinai in Egypt , where God is said to have handed the Ten Commandments to Moses .
Changi Airport , Singapore : Plane spotters in the new terminal 3 can take a wee look at the giant Airbus A380
Tasman Glacier , New Zealand :
An aerial shot shows just how close this loo is to the edge
Mount Sinai , Egypt :
The best place to see sunrise on the mountain is said to be from this toilet , where the early - morning light floods through the bamboo walls
Boulder Pass Campsite , Montana : A wooden loo in Glacier National Park , with a stunning view of Agassiz Glacier
Guard Tower , Alcatraz : Warders at the infamous jail had an all - round view of San Francisco Bay while they took a comfort break
The loos on the lookout tower at Alcatraz clearly worked , as no escape attempts were successful in the prison 's 29 - year history .
But women using the aquarium toilet at Mumin Papa Cafe in Akashi , Japan , have complained of being watched by a male sea turtle .
However , the future for interesting toilets is bright , as the new men's loo in Terminal 3 of Singapore 's Changi Airport proves .

Mumin Papa Cafe , Japan :
This ladies ' loo in Akashi is built into an aquarium , so you can watch the fishes as you , erm , meditate .
But beware of the inquisitive male sea turtle

Mice that were fed a diet rich in fat , sugar and cholesterol for nine months developed a preliminary stage of the morbid irregularities that form in the brains of Alzheimer 's patients .
The study results , published in a doctoral thesis from the Swedish medical university Karolinska Institutet ( KI ) , give some indications of how this difficult to treat disease might one day be preventable .
Alzheimer 's is the most common form of dementia , there being roughly 90,000 patients with the disease in Sweden today .
The underlying causes of Alzheimer 's disease are still something of a mystery , but there are a number of known risk factors .
The most common is a variant of a certain gene that governs the production of apolipoprotein E , one of the functions of which is to transport cholesterol .
The gene variant is called apoE4 and is found in 15 - 20 per cent of the population .
For her doctoral thesis , Susanne Akterin studied mice that had been genetically modified to mimic the effects of apoE4 in humans .
The mice were then fed for nine months on a diet rich in fat , sugar and cholesterol , representing the nutritional content of most fast food .
" On examining the brains of these mice , we found a chemical change not unlike that found in the Alzheimer brain , " says Ms Akterin , postgraduate at KI Alzheimer 's Disease Research Center .
The change in question was an increase in phosphate groups attached to tau , a substance that forms the neurofibrillary tangles observed in Alzheimer 's patients .
These tangles prevent the cells from functioning normally , which eventually leads to their death .
Ms Akterin and her team also noted indications that cholesterol in food reduced levels of another brain substance , Arc , a protein involved in memory storage .
" We now suspect that a high intake of fat and cholesterol in combination with genetic factors , such as apoE4 , can adversely affect several brain substances , which can be a contributory factor in the development of Alzheimer 's , " says Susanne Akterin .
Previous research has shown that a phenomenon known as oxidative stress in the brain and a relatively low intake of dietary antioxidants can also increase the risk of Alzheimer's .
Ms Akterin has now demonstrated in her thesis that two antioxidants are dysfunctional in the brains of Alzheimer patients , which can lead to nerve cell death .
" All in all , the results give some indication of how Alzheimer 's can be prevented , but more research in this field needs to be done before proper advice can be passed on to the general public , " she says .

Kummersdorf was the cradle of Germany 's rocket programme
Enlarge Image
A few dozen miles south of Berlin , Germany , in the province of Brandenburg , a narrow tree - lined road weaves across scenic meadows and lake - side villages .
Near the town of Kummersdorf , a complex of old brown buildings resembling military barracks stands at the intersection of a seemingly abandoned railway line .
Right across from it , a barricaded road made of rough concrete blocks cuts through the thick pine forest .
As it curves into the wilderness , strange ruins appear , lurking in the depths of the woods .
Covered with Russian - language graffiti , these semi-collapsed bunkers can be easily mistaken for remnants of the Soviet military bases which litter Eastern Europe .
Yet , these unmarked structures represent a forgotten cradle of the Space Age .
These were powers that were trying to catch up , they were willing to entertain rather outlandish ideas like rockets
Michael Neufeld , National Air and Space Museum
It is here that the German military initiated the world 's first large - scale rocket development programme in the first half of the 20th Century .
This programme led to the development of the infamous V - 2 rocket , used by Germany against the allies during World War II .
And it is also here that Wernher von Braun and other key figures in the German " rocket team " started their professional careers in rocketry , culminating almost four decades later with the first Moon landing .
Unproven technology
At the beginning of the 1930s , rocketry was the domain of science fiction novels and small groups of amateur enthusiasts , who were largely looked down upon by respectable scientists .
The work begun at Kummersdorf would lead to the infamous V - 2 rocket Still , the German military , or Reichswehr , which was hungry to re-arm itself after World War I , put its bets on this unproven technology and its fanatical enthusiasts .
Many early historians and veterans of the German rocket programme distilled the reasons for the military interest in rockets to a loophole in the Versailles Treaty .
Signed in the wake of German defeat in World War I , the document severely limited the number of troops and the calibre of weapons of post - war Germany .
The Treaty , however , said nothing about rockets - thus technically making them legal .
" This explanation does n't quite add up , because they ( the Germans ) were secretly violating the Versailles Treaty , as much as they could get away with , " says Michael Neufeld , head of space history department at the Smithsonian 's National Air and Space Museum in Washington DC , and author of a biography of von Braun .
Along with rockets , the German military was engaged in a chemical warfare programme , and , in an unlikely alliance with the USSR , the Reichswehr was developing conventional weapons , such as tanks , aircraft and artillery in bland violation of the Versailles Treaty .
The decaying structures are unmarked and overgrown

" It does n't meant the Versailles Treaty is not important , clearly it created the situation where there was openness to the radical new solution to military problems , and to some extent , it is true for the Soviet Union as well , " Dr Neufeld says .
" Because these were powers that were trying to catch up , they were willing to entertain rather outlandish ideas like rockets . "
Kevin Madders , author of A New Force at a New Frontier - a book on the history of Europe 's space programme - adds that it was a lack of ability to mass - produce big guns by German industry in the aftermath of World War I , rather than the omission of rockets in the Versailles Treaty , which pushed the German military to try this exotic technology .
" It was that specific restraint ( of the Treaty ) on their artillery pieces ... that was the driver ( for the rocket programme ) , " Mr Madders explains .
Humble beginnings
On November 1 , 1932 , a new civilian employee reported to work at the newly created army rocket lab in Kummersdorf .
Wernher von Braun , then aged 20 , had joined from one of the amateur rocket groups , based in Berlin , calling themselves the Verein für Raumschiffahrt ( VfR , or the Society for Space Travel ) .
The son of a minister in the government of Germany 's Weimar Republic , he was wildly enthusiastic about space .
Von Braun ( second from right ) had been involved in amateur rocketry Unlike his friends at VfR , von Braun had no reservations about working within the secretive confines of the military .
In fact , he thought that it was the only path from " toy rockets " to the passenger - carrying spaceships of which he dreamt .
Starting with only one assistant , von Braun 's task was to investigate the most exotic type of rocket technology - liquid propulsion .
Although much more promising than the traditional powder fuels , liquid propellants were unwieldy , untested and highly dangerous .
In December 1934 , after two years of sleepless nights , frustrating failures and violent explosions - one of which killed three people - von Braun 's fledgling rocket team succeeded in launching its first liquid - fuelled rocket - the A - 2 .
It climbed to the altitude of about 1.8 km , higher than any rocket had reached at the time .
The site 's original rocket testing facility still stands

The success of the A - 2 demonstrated to the sceptics that liquid - propellant rocketry was no crackpot dream .
Much more importantly for von Braun 's army sponsors , it was now clear the rocket could be turned into a weapon of war , perhaps exceeding the capabilities of long - range artillery .
While Germany was descending into Nazism , the secret rocket team in Kummersdorf was showered with extra funding and promises of expansion .
Although Hitler officially tore up the Versailles Treaty in 1935 and could now openly develop all traditional weapons , there was no sign of discontinuing the rocket programme .
Unknown programme " The Nazis came to power with an ideological commitment to increase armament spending massively , across the board , " says Kevin Madders .
" They were n't concentrating on the most successful systems , but rather were producing global ability across their armed forces . " von Braun 's team experienced many failures before launching the A - 2 Although by 1935 , the scale and scope of the German rocket development programme far exceeded any similar effort in the world , it was apparently unknown to the West 's intelligence services until at least 1939 .
It was in this year that a document now known as the Oslo report was dropped into the mailbox of the British embassy in Norway .
The report outlined a number of weapons systems being developed by the Nazis .
However , post - Cold War Russian publications reveal earlier attempts to penetrate the German rocket effort in Kummersdorf .
As early as 1935 , the Soviet government apparently received its first intelligence reports about the secret German missile programme .
Soviet intelligence services were reportedly receiving information from Willy Lehmann , a high - ranking SS official , overseeing the security of the military industry in the Third Reich .
Lehmann personally witnessed numerous firings of liquid - propellant engines developed by von Braun .
Lehmann had been relaying information to Moscow since 1934 , via Vasily Mikhailovich Zarubin , the head of the Soviet spy network in Berlin .
At some point in the 1930s , a detailed written report on German missile tests by Lehmann was delivered to Soviet premier Joseph Stalin .
However , it appears that Lehmann was eventually discovered and shot , perhaps shutting the last peephole into the German rocket effort .
" ( Apparently ) , they had this one isolated report ( to Stalin ) .
In general , there was very little information on German rocket programme in any country , " says Michael Neufeld .
During the 1930s , Soviet rocket development had been growing at least as briskly as the German effort until Stalin 's purges of 1937 dismantled the main rocket research team .
Moving premises
With the dramatic expansion of Germany 's rocket programme in 1935 , the ambitions of von Braun and his army bosses also soared .
Still looking at artillery as a potential competitor for rockets , von Braun 's engineers conceived a vehicle which would double the range of the most powerful cannon .
To build and test this device , along with an entire arsenal of different rocket - powered weapons , von Braun 's architects drafted blueprints for an entire research city near the Baltic Coast village of Peenemuende .
The V - 2 rocket , conceived at Kummersdorf , would lead to vehicles that could propel humans toward the Moon
This was to include research labs , test stands , a wind tunnel , a residential village and a concentration camp - something that would return to haunt von Braun and his fellow workers in later years .
Most of von Braun 's engineers had left Kummersdorf for Peenemunde by May 1937 .
In 1944 , von Braun 's A - 4 rockets - renamed Vengeance Weapon 2 ( or V - 2 ) by Nazi propagandists - began raining down on London and other allied population centres .
Although it failed to change the outcome of the war , the A - 4 did not die .
First conceived in the walls of Kummersdorf , the A - 4 left a far - reaching legacy across three continents .
Soviet , French , British and Chinese rocket efforts were all influenced by and benefited from the A - 4 ( or V - 2 ) technology .
Wernher von Braun was captured along with many of his engineers by the Americans in 1945 , as World War II drew to a close .
The German rocket chief transferred to America to work on rockets for the US military .
Wernher von Braun and many of his team would stand at the helm of US missile development and the country 's space programme until the day the Apollo 11 astronauts walked on the Moon in July 1969 .

Rep. Robin Hayes ( R - N.C. ) conceded that he did tell a crowd that \ " liberals hate real Americans , \ " but says he did n't mean it that way .
Rep. says ' Liberals hate real Americans '
Rep. Robin Hayes ( R - N.C. ) has conceded that he did tell a North Carolina crowd that " liberals hate real Americans that work and accomplish and achieve and believe in God , " even though he initially denied making such a statement .
Now he says he did n’t mean it that way and he was just trying to rev up a campaign rally .

“ I genuinely did not recall making the statement and , after reading it , there is no doubt that it came out completely the wrong way .
I actually was trying to work to keep the crowd as respectful as possible , so this is definitely not what I intended , ” Hayes said in a statement for Politico .
The comments were first reported by the New York Observer .
When Politico linked to the Observer story on Monday evening , Hayes ' spokeswoman Amanda Little called and denied the report .
Observer reporter Jason Horowitz told Politico he stood firmly behind the story .
Politico left the quote in The Crypt blog but added the Hayes denial .
On Tuesday , two more reporters and two other witnesses confirmed the quote , but Little continued to deny it , calling the story " irresponsible journalism . "
Little said she had just as many sources who would deny it , including Hayes ' staff and Rep. Patrick McHenry ( R - N.C. ) , who spoke before Hayes .
But then Politico obtained an audio file of the Hayes quote from radio reporter Lisa Miller of WFAE .
Little backed down , saying that Hayes must have misspoken .
There was one small difference between the actual quote and the Observer quote .
The Observer had missed that Hayes had included " and accomplish " in his comment , reporting it instead as , " liberals hate real Americans that work and achieve and believe in God . "
Hayes had been warming up a crowd at a rally in Concord when he made the remarks .
Hayes set up his comment by saying that Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin , John McCain 's running mate , was a " real American . "
McCain later appeared at the rally .
Before Hayes ' comment , he had told the crowd , presumably as part of his effort to keep the audience respectful , that he wanted to " make sure we do n't say something stupid , make sure we do n't say something we do n't mean . "
Hayes ' comment came the day after Rep. Michele Bachmann ( R - Minn . ) told MSNBC 's Chris Matthews that the media should investigate which members of Congress are " anti-America " and which are " pro-America . "
In Greensboro , N.C. , Palin had said at a recent rally that " we believe that the best of America is in these small towns that we get to visit , and in these wonderful little pockets of what I call the real America , being here with all of you hard - working , very patriotic , pro-America areas of this great nation . "
Hayes had followed Rep. Patrick McHenry , also a North Carolina Republican , who laid out the choice between McCain and Obama .
" It 's like black and white , " yelled someone from the crowd .
The quickness with which the controversy over the accuracy of the remarks was settled is an example of the changing nature of political campaign coverage .
One source that Politico was able to use to confirm the comment came from a Twitter post stamped 10:41 a.m. Saturday by a reporter from The Daily Tar Heel .
Another Politico reader said he heard the comment at about 10:30 a.m. , independently confirming the timeline .
Lisa Zagarali , a reporter with McClatchy , wrote in as well , saying , " I taped it .
He said it . "

Finally , FINALLY we ’re starting to treat the RIAA like an organized crime syndicate .
Check the latest on a RICO class - action in Missouri , via Slashdot :
“ In Atlantic Recording v. Raleigh , an RIAA case pending in St. Louis , Missouri , the defendant has asserted detailed counterclaims against the RIAA for federal RICO violations , fraud , violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act , prima facie tort , trespass , and conspiracy .
The claims focus on the RIAA ’s ‘ driftnet ’ tactic of suing innocent people , and of demanding extortionate settlements .
The RICO ‘ predicate acts ’ alleged in the 42 - page pleading ( PDF ) are extortion , mail fraud , and wire fraud .
This is a wonderful approach .
Even if the suit gets nowhere , the RIAA ’s business model in recent years has hinged on litigation and intimidation , not finding innovative ways of making the Internets work for them and the artists they allegedly represent .
With a little luck , maybe the Missouri case will intimidate the RIAA right back .
With a little more luck , maybe the counterclaimant wins .
Pair that with an FCC appointee ( and bear with me while I indulge a hopeless fantasy here ) who ’s willing to reassert the public interest standard , and you might even have something on the radio that you could stand listening to …..
( CNN ) --
The head of Pakistan 's ruling coalition announced Thursday that the government will move to impeach President Pervez Musharraf .
President Pervez Musharraf took control of Pakistan in a military coup in 1999 .
" The coalition reaffirmed the resolve of democracy and democratic forces will work jointly to make a transition to genuine democracy , " the head of Pakistan People 's Party Asif Ali Zardari said , reading a joint communique with his coalition partners .
Before pursuing impeachment proceedings , Pakistani lawmakers will demand Musharraf take a vote of confidence in the newly elected parliament , which he had vowed to do last year , Zardari said .
" The people of Pakistan gave a clear mandate in favor of democracy and democratic forces and voted for the change to oust Gen. Musharraf by defeating his ... party , " Zardari added .
" In spite of his clear commitment that if his party was defeated in the election he would resign , he continues to cling to the office of the president . "
Watch an expert talk about the impact of a possible impeachment »
If Musharraf does not request a vote of confidence , the National Assembly will meet on Monday to consider impeachment proceedings , PPP spokesman Capt .
Wasif Syed told CNN .
Speaking a short time before Thursday 's announcement , Syed said there are enough votes in parliament right now to impeach the president .
But Musharraf may still have one card up his sleeve : he could move to dissolve parliament and dismiss the prime minister .
Amid the political upheaval , Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani will replace Musharraf at the opening ceremony of the Olympics on Friday in Beijing , Pakistan 's state - run news agency reported .
Musharraf , who seized power in a 1999 bloodless military coup , has seen his power erode significantly since he stepped down as the country 's military ruler last year and since the opposition parties ' victory in February 's parliamentary elections .
The new civilian government is under a lot of pressure to control Taliban and al Qaeda militants in its tribal region along the Afghan border .
The CIA recently accused Pakistan 's intelligence service of providing support for the militants who bombed India 's embassy in Kabul , Afghanistan last month .
Fighting on Thursday between Pakistani paramilitary troops and Taliban forces killed 25 Taliban and five soldiers along the Afghan border , an army spokesman told CNN .
Asked about the situation , Dr. Ishtiaq Ahmad -- an Islamabad - based political analyst -- told CNN on Wednesday that he believes Musharraf " will fight back " against any attempt to remove him from power .
" Before they impeach the president , he might pre-empt them by using article 58 ( 2 b ) , " he said , referring to the constitutional article that gives the president power to dissolve parliament and dismiss the prime minister .
Ahmad , a professor of international relations at Islamabad 's Quaid - i- Azam University , said any attempt to remove Musharraf would be a " next to an impossible task " because the president still has support .
" The army does n't want him to be eliminated .
The Americans are still favoring him , " he noted .

[ Editor 's note : craineum 's epic Halloween costumes are finally done !
Check out craineum 's entire process in making all three costumes and follow the links at the end of the post to find out how exactly he made the fantastic Mega Man costume .
-- CTZ ]
Ever since I got out of high school and into college , I realized that I should not be ashamed of the geek inside .
Once this revelation hit me , there has been a desire building inside of me to create my own Halloween costumes .
But there was always something that stopped me ... time , money , idea 's , or just being plain lazy .
I never had the right motivation .
It is amazing how having kids will motivate people to do things they normally would never try .
This year was going to be the first year that I really sat down and created my costumes from scratch .
My oldest son ( now 3 - years - old ) is at a point where he can help a little and it was something we could do together .
I also wanted to include our youngest son ( 1 - year - old ) in a combined / group costume .
I wanted the costumes to work together as a group , and to be close to size appropriate .
I could n't come up with any idea 's that I thought I could handle making .
I wanted to do a Bowser / Mario / Koopa set , but that seemed like a stretch for my abilities .
So I opened it up to the Awesome Destructoid Community .
There were a ton of good idea's , some that I will probably use in the following years , but the one that stuck out for me this year was from Mr Wilson .
He submitted this picture along with some ideas :
This grabbed me for a couple of reasons .
The Characters were the right size , they did n't seem to difficult to build , and I completely remembered watching this crappy show !
So it was decided , I would be Captain N , 3 - year - old would be Mega Man , 1 - year - old would be Pit .
* Captain N *
Time to Build : Maybe an hour
Cost : $ 90
The Jacket
As I wanted something that looked good and seemed authentic , I decided to purchase a real letterman jacket and tweak it for my needs .
This was the hardest item to acquire for all the costumes since it was so specific .
I was watching eBay for about a month before the right size / color / price came up .
I got this Jacket for $ 20 !!!
It is a real letterman jacket , made of wool and leather .
It came with a big white " M " on it instead of a black " N " .
The " N " cost me more than the jacket ... with shipping $ 30 .
I took this to the local dry cleaner and they sewed it on for $ 4 .
It would have been way more hassle to stitch it on ourselves ( since we did n't have the knowledge , and still have n't figured out how they did it so cleanly ) , so this was well worth it .
Light Gun
The light gun I already had , so all I did was to take it apart , and disconnect the wire ( which had a plug connector inside the gun ) .
The I bought a gun holster for a few bucks .
NES Controller Buckle
I could have made this myself , but with the work that was going into the Mega Man costume , I did n't want to overload myself .
I found a site called NESBuckle.com , which had what I needed .
Awesome I thought , after placing the order , I never heard anything from them .
I think the site was legit , have seen so much stuff around the net about them , but seems like they may have gone defunct ?!?
So right now I have an open claim with PayPal trying to get my money back .
Long story short ... do n't buy anything from them .
However , I did find the same thing on eBay for $ 30 , Score !
The rest of the costume was easy , yellow shirt from goodwill , jeans and shoes I obviously already had .
* Pit *
Time to Build : About 2 hours
Cost : $ 40
This was the cheapest and easiest of the three .
I got the wings at Party City for about $ 15 ( which the little one is refusing to wear now ) .
I modified them by cutting down the straps so they would fit on my 1 - year - old .
The toga ( or small woman 's shirt ) and belt were picked up from Goodwill for about $ 7 for both .
The belt had to be shortened to fit my 1 - year - old as well .
Picked up a small bow for a couple of dollars .
The leather shoes we already had matched well .
* Mega Man *
Time to Build : About 40 - 50 hours
Cost : $ 70
Injuries : Several burns
The Helmet
This took about 15 - 20 hours .
I got respect for the hot glue gun as I received several burns and blisters from it .
The Cars bike helmet was $ 20 , frisbee free .
LED 's / electronics were about $ 10 .
The foam / fabric was from Goodwill type places and were about $ 5 .
My only regret is that the helmet seems big on him .
I would like a little bit tighter fit , but I am still very happy with the final product .
The Mega Buster
This took about 15 - 20 hours .
I few less burns and blisters during this build , even though it was much more complex .
The tupperware was about $ 15 , LED's / electronics $ 15 .
When I finished this ... I was giddy .
I thought it looked pretty good for my first ever costume build .
All the warm comments from the Destructoid community just drove me on further .
The Boots
This was about 6 hours .
By this time , I stopped burning myself ( Yay ! ) .
The only additional cost here was the blue foam , which I think was a couple of dollars at Goodwill .
The Gloves
This was about 4 hours .
The Suit
My wife said she spent about 5 hours on this .
Again , ca n't thank her enough .
When I first started this costume , I was not planning on it being this involved .
But the more I got into it , the more excited I got , the deeper it took me .
When I made the decision to add the LED 's is when it made things more complicated ( at least for me ) .
I had to think about how I was going to mount them , where I was going to store the batteries , how I was going to get them to glow .
In the end , I really think the LED 's made the costume , not just for the coolness factor of it lighting up , but also all the decisions I made because of them .
When I got done with the costume , and fitted it on our son for the first time ... my wife just looked at me and started laughing .
I asked her what she was laughing at , her response : " Your like a little boy Christmas morning getting ready to open all your presents , with this silly grin plastered on your face . "
I could n't help it ...
I was just so happy , and that described my joy perfectly .
And it also worked as a cool thing for me and my son to do together .
He really enjoyed helping me ( even if it was simple stuff like throwing away some trash ) .
As we were taking pictures my wife said to our son , " Move the gun up a little " to which my son replied , " No! Its a Mega Buster ! " I could not have been prouder !
Then when I found out that Capcom had seen , and linked to my articles , it just made it ...
Thanks Chad ... could not have said it better .
Damn ... I am going to have to start working on next years right now to top this ...
Anyways , attached are a bunch of photo's of us ( and yes a lot of the Mega Man Costume , which is the one everyone wants ) .

This list follows our previous popular list of Top 10 Common English Errors .
Hopefully a few of these will help to fix one or two mistakes that we all make from time to time .
10 Who / Whom
This particular error has become so common that it is beginning to look like the word “ whom ” may vanish entirely from the English language .
The reason for this is that so many people have no idea what the difference is .
The difference is a simple one : who “ does ” the action , and whom has the action “ done ” to them .
We use this difference in other words – “ I ” and “ me ” for example .
“ who ” is the equivalent of “ I ” , and “ whom ” is the equivalent of “ me ” .
The technical term for this difference is noun case – “ who ” is the nominative case , and “ whom ” is the accusative .
Here is an example of correct usage :
Who is going to kill Bob ?
( I am going to kill Bob )
Bob is going to be killed by whom ?
( Bob is going to be killed by me )
English does not use cases as much as it used to .
Many other language do use cases frequently , such as German , Latin , Greek , etc . [ Image Source – click for a larger view ]
9 Irony
On the previous list of errors I included Irony as a bonus – it deserves its own place and a fully description so here it is .
There are four types of irony ( none of which resemble remotely anything in Alanis Morissette ’s song :
I. Verbal irony
This is when the speaker says one thing but means another ( often contrary ) thing .
The most well known type of verbal irony is sarcasm .
For example : “ He is as funny as cancer ” .
II .
Tragic irony
Tragic irony occurs only in fiction .
It is when the words or actions of a character contradict the real situation with the full knowledge of the spectators .
For example :
In Romeo and Juliet , Romeo mistakenly believes that Juliet has killed herself , so he poisons himself .
Juliet awakens to find Romeo dead so she kills herself with his knife .
III .
Dramatic Irony
In drama , this type of irony is when the spectator is given a piece of information that one or more of the characters are unaware of .
For example : in Pygmalion , we know that Eliza is a prostitute , but the Higgins family do n’t .
IV . Situational Irony
Situational irony is when there is a difference between the expected result and the actual result .
Take for example this account of the attempted assassination of Ronald Regan : “ As aides rushed to push Reagan into his car , the bullet ricocheted off the [ bullet - proof ] car , then hit the President in the chest , grazed a rib and lodged in his lung , just inches from his heart . ”
The bullet proof car – intended to protect the president , nearly caused his death by deflecting the bullet .

8 Effect / Affect
These two words are commonly confused – probably due in part to the fact that both words have more than one meaning .
I will explain clearly the main difference and just briefly mention the other ( rare ) meanings :
Affect ( a - FECT ) : this is usually a verb ( doing word ) and the form most commonly confused with “ effect ” .
It means “ to influence ” or “ to cause a change ” .
For example : John ’s protest affected great change in the farming industry ( John ’s protest caused change to happen ) .
Effect ( e - FECT ) : this is usually a noun ( thing ) and it refers to the “ end result ” or the impact something has on someone or something .
For example , “ the cocaine had a numbing effect ” , or “ her smile had a strange effect on me ” .
For those who are curious , affect ( AFF - ect ) means “ emotion ” but this meaning is used almost exclusively by psychiatrists .
And just to further confuse the whole thing , “ effect ” can also mean “ to create ” – which is probably the reason that many people confuse it with affect ( a - FECT ) .
For example : “ I am trying to effect a new council in the city ” .
But wait , there ’s more : something can “ take effect “ , but it cannot “ take affect “ .
Confused ?
No wonder .
Here is a simple way to remember the basic rule :
If it ’s something you ’re going to do , use “ affect . ”
If it ’s something you ’ve already done , use “ effect . ”
7 Lie / Lay
Lay :
To put something or someone down : “ lay your head on the pillow ” .
Lay needs a direct object to act upon – in the example here the object is “ your head ” .
Lie :
To rest in a horizontal position or to be located somewhere : “ If you are tired , lie down ” , “ New Zealand lies in the Pacific Ocean ” .
Lie does not need a direct object to act upon – therefore it would be wrong to say “ if you are tired , lie yourself down ” .
6 Would have
This is seen quite often these days and some people claim that it is acceptable English , but it is not .
Do not do it .
Here is an example of the offending phrase :
“ I wish she would have kissed me ”
To correct this grievous error , you need to say : “ I wish she had kissed me ” .
The reason this is wrong is that “ wished ” suggests something contrary to reality , and adding “ would have ” which is also a statement of contrariness , is excessive and unnecessary .
Of course , “ would have ” is perfectly acceptable in the following sentence : “ I would have given a donation if I agreed with the party ’s politics . ”
5 Me / Myself / I
The most common problem here is the use of “ myself ” .
Take this sentence : “ If you have any questions , ask Jane or myself ” .
This is wrong .
To see how obviously wrong it is , just take Jane out : “ If you have any questions , ask myself ” .
It seems that many people think that “ myself ” is like an intensified version of “ me ” .
So how do we use “ myself ” correctly ?
“ Myself ” is only used when “ I ” has already been used .
For example : “ I washed myself ” or “ I put half of the cake away for myself . ”
This is the only time it is ever used .
The same rules apply for “ herself ” and “ himself ” .
The difference between “ I ” and “ me ” is the same as that shown in item 10 above .
“ I ” is the “ doer ” and “ me ” is the “ done to ” .
For example :
I paid the tax department .
The tax department paid me .
Things get a bit more confusing when you add a second person , but the rule is exactly the same :
Jim and I paid our taxes .
The tax department gave refunds to Jim and me .
4 Less / Fewer
The difference between less and fewer is that one is used in reference to “ number ” – things you can count , and the other in reference to “ amount ” – things measured in bulk .
For example , you ca n’t count sand , so if we want to empty a hole filled with sand , we say “ we need less sand in that hole ” – but if we want to empty a hole filled with eggs , we say “ we need fewer eggs in that hole ” .
There are other words that follow the same rule :
“ A great quantity of sand ” – “ A great number of eggs ”
“ We should remove a little sand ” – “ We should remove a few eggs ”
“ There is too much sand ” – “ There are too many eggs ”
If you eat too many ice - creams , people might think you have eaten too much dessert .
We commonly see this error crop up with regards to people : “ We need less people on this team ” – this should actually be “ we need fewer people on this team ” .
Measurements of time and money ignore this rule , therefore we say : “ I have less than 5 dollars ” and “ It takes less than 2 hours to get to Paris ” .
3 Different Than
This is wrong .
It is a very common error and an appalling one at that !
The correct form is “ different from ” .
In British common use , many people say “ different to ” but that is still technically bad form and most UK style guides reject it .
Let us look at each option :
Wrong : “ Pink is different than blue ” ( common use in the US )
Wrong : “ Pink is different to blue ” ( common use in the UK )
Questionable : “ John is different than he was before his accident .
( this can be phrased better – but because “ different ” is followed by a full clause , some accept it . )
Right : “ Pink is different from blue ” .
2 Anyway / Any Way / Anyways
First of all , “ anyways ” is not an English word – in fact , I am not aware of it being a word in any language at all .
You should never say “ anyways ” .
The word most often crops up in sentences such as this : “ John was an idiot anyways ! ”
The correct word to use is “ anyway ” .
Secondly , anyway is different from any way – both are acceptable but have different uses :
“ I did n’t like him anyway ” , and : “ is there any way to stop the marriage ? ”
There /
They ’re / Their
I am sure no one will disagree with this entry being number 1 on the list – it is extremely common nowadays to see these words interchanged – sometimes with hilarious consequences but usually not .
Let us look at each word separately :
They ’re :
The apostrophe is used here to replace a missing letter – the letter ‘ a ’ .
“ They ’re ” means “ they are ” – it only mean “ they are ” , and can never mean anything else .
So if you want to say that someone is happy , you say “ they ’re happy ” .
Remember , the apostrophe stands for a missing letter .
Their :
This means “ belongs to them ” – it only means “ belong to them ” and nothing else .
The confusion that has arisen over this word is no doubt related to the fact the an apostrophe is often used to denote possession – such as “ John ’s dog ” – but when we are talking about “ them ” possessing something , we do n’t use the apostrophe .
There : Everything else falls in to this category .
“ There is a happy man ” , “ Over there ! ” , “ There are n’t many people at the party ” .
Here is a little tip for remembering :
Their – “ Their ” has “ heir ” in it – an heir ultimately possesses items left to them in a will .
There – “ There ” has “ here ” in it – this can remind you that it refers to a place .
I noticed that in the past I produced several posts about combining LaTex and Emacs .
While I do like Emacs and respect it ’s formidable power I do not consider myself an Emacs user .
Most of my day - to - day work is done in Vim which brings different kind of editing power to the table .
Emacs is a lisp based framework for building text editing applications – fully programmable , easily customizable and almost endlessly extensible .
The power of Emacs comes from what it can do .
Vim ’s power stems from what it does – and that is providing very powerful and yet simple modal text editing environment .
I wanted to say intuitive , but yeah – that would be a lie .
Vim is powerful because it allows you to accomplish just about anything in 3 - 4 keystrokes by chaining and combining simple commands .
Using Vim makes editing text much simpler and easier .
It removes a lot of key - presses and movements .
Let me give you an example – in a typical coding session you may want to copy the current line , and paste it below .
Assuming your cursor is in the middle of the line how would you go about accomplishing it ?
Typically you would do :
Hit Home to skip to the beginning of the line Hold shift and hit End to highlight the line Press Ctrl +C to copy the line Hit End again to put the cursor at the end of the line Hit Enter to insert a new line Press Ctrl +V to paste the line
How do you do it in Vim ?
Press the following keys in a sequence : yyp
That ’s it .
You want to paste the line 3 times ?
Do yy 3 p .
This is the power you get when you use Vim .
Of course die - hard emacs fanboys will remind me that one could always use Emacs ’ VIP mode which emulates vi’s modal editing features .
And they would be absolutely right .
As I said , Emacs is a framework for building editors rather than an editor .
So when you launch it in VIP mode you are really using Vi with the lisp powerhouse underneath it .
In theory you could combine the neat features of AUCTex on Emacs and the power the VIP mode gives you to get the best of both worlds .
But if you do n’t need these features – if you are a Vim purist or if you just need a simple modal text editor I have a nice alternative for you .
It ’s called VimLaTex .
While it does not have the nice rendering features of AUCTex , VimLaTex is a must - have if you are planning to use Vim to edit LaTex files .
The package itself is tiny – you just drop few hundred KB into your .vim directory and add few lines to your .vimrc .
The suite will add bunch of useful menus to your toolbar :
These menus are your standard IDE like features – for example options for inserting packages , or snippets of code for special environments and etc. .
A lot of the entries come with predefined key - bindings which make your life much easier .
For example :
To compile your file do : \ll
To view compiled file do : \lv
You can set the preferred format for both options above by invoking : TTarget .
It works like a charm both on Windows and Linux when I tried it .
VimLaTex also uses an interesting concept of placeholders .
Whenever you use it to generate snippet of code , it will put funny looking character sequences inside of it .
They may look silly until you realize how useful they are .
For example let ’s say you want to insert a figure :
\ begin{figure} [h ] \ centerline {\psfig{figure=«eps file » }} \caption { « caption text » } \label{fig : « label »} \end{figure} « »
The placeholders are there to make your life easier .
When you press Ctrl + J vim will jump to the first «» delimited sequence and select it .
This way you can just type over it .
Press Ctrl +J again ( while still in insert mode ) and you will jump to the next one .
How awesome is that ?
If you are a Vim lover who also happens to use LaTex or a LaTex user who loves Vim definitely check this one out .
As anyone who ’s ever made an e-commerce system knows , money is everything .
No , really if you do n’t get your financial sums right then you ca n’t hope to build a successful online business ( and may find yourself creating potential legal issues with the tax man ) .
So here ’s a rundown of the top tips I can give for making your financial calculations that bit easier .
1. Always Work in Minor Units
I ca n’t stress enough how much this helps in terms of accuracy , rounding and speed .
Working in major units may look better to you as you do n’t have to reformat the numbers to display them but I hope I can make the case here for minor units .
a. Integer arithmetic is much much faster than floating point arithmetic .
Remember that even a single decimal place makes a number a float as far as your computer is concerned and all the processor overheads that go along with them suddenly arrive .
I know it ’s not a lot slower but in a complex financial system it all adds up believe me .
b. Floating point arithmetic can get its sums wrong .
Do n’t believe me ?
Then pull up a Ruby console and try this :
a = " 69.54 " .to_f
b = a * 100
b.ceil
Gives 6955 instead of 6954 .
This is because the limitations of floating point arithmetic have caused something like 0.0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001 to be added to 69.54 .
I spent a good 4 hours chasing this bug which manifested itself as a 1 p discrepency .
c. Trailing zeros can cause problems for major units .
Think of trying to pass round £ 10.00 or £ 1.10 in major units .
Storing it as a float you would keep losing the trailing zeros and would find yourself having to sprintf all over the place .
I ’ve seen plenty of systems in my time that store prices as decimal strings to get round these issues !
There are of course various decimal formats that can be used ( decimal is a data type in MySQL and BigDecimal has been introduced in Ruby on Rails ) but when it comes down to it , these are just wrappers around either floats or stings and majorly sub-optimal for the other reasons given .
2. Freeze the Exchange Rate
If your business works in pounds but you allow payments to be made in Euros then with every payment you need to store the current exchange rate with it .
Exchange rates change by the day and if you do n’t know exactly what rate you get for your transactions then you can kiss goodbye to any sort of accurate profit calculations .
3. Rounding : Pick a Direction and Stick With It
Often you will need to apply discounts , add markup etc and have to perform percentage calculations .
If you are working in minor units this should be the only time ( in normal day to day operations ) that you ever have to handle fractions of pence .
You will make your life so much simpler if , for all these calculations you decide the direction to round and stick with it .
Do you want to keep the extra for yourself or be a nice guy and let the customer keep it ?
That ’s what the decision comes down to .
If you do n’t have consistency in this you really will find yourself spending days chasing 1 p discrepancies .
From a coding point of view I tend to round down as preference because ( as I demonstrate above ) floating point arithmetic can get it wrong sometimes and , as it just wipes out everything after the decimal point , a ‘ floor ’ function is much more reliable that a ‘ ceil ’ .
4. Use a Pre-Filter On Your Submissions
Of course your customers are always going to want to work in major units – no - one wants to see prices in pence splashed all over your website and it ’s much more intuitive to type major units into form fields .
What I like to do is put a pre-filter on all input coming into my back end system ( so in Rails you would run the filter on ‘ params ’ or in PHP you would run it on ‘ $_REQUEST ’) which pattern matches any string monetary amount ( remember , all form submission values come through as strings ) in a major unit and converts it to an integer minor unit .
In Rails it ’s in the application controller and looks like this :
def filter_units ( input )
if [ Array , Hash , HashWithIndifferentAccess].include ?( input.class )
input.each do |key , value|
#recurse through the data structure
input[key ] = self.filter_units ( value )
end
# match the string format for a major unit
elsif not input.nil ? and input.match(/^\d+\.\d\d ) $ / )
# convert to a minor unit integer
( input.to_f * 100.0 ) .to_i
else
#return the value unchanged
input
end
end
This also has the added benefit of validating monetary amounts – if a monetary field does n’t hit your back end as an integer then you know it has failed validation .
So there you have it .
I ’m not saying these are all the answers to a coding trouble - free finance system for your e-commerce store , but they ’ll give you a solid starting point and hopefully avoid a few hours of head - scratching .
REDS – Die Roten > State Capitalismus | Staatskapitalismus > Modern World
Peter Binns
State Capitalism
( 1986 )
from the collection , Marxism and the Modern World , Education for Socialists No.1 , March 1986 .
Published by the Socialist Workers Party ( Britain ) .
This is shortened version of an article first published in International Socialism journal .
Transcribed & marked up by Einde O’Callaghan for REDS – Die Roten .
As socialists we cannot avoid the question of Russia .
Every time we argue for a socialist revolution here at home we have the example of Russia thrown back in our faces : the “ socialist ” slave camps of the Gulag Archipelago , the “ socialist ” tanks that invaded Czechoslovakia in 1968 , the “ socialist ” helicopter gunships in Afghanistan , the “ socialist ” imprisonment of free trade unionists in Eastern Europe .
There is an urgent need to confront these questions .
Does a serious Marxist analysis of Russia really reveal it to be socialist ?
Does it reveal it to be , as some people on the left argue , a superior form of society that is on the road to socialism ?
If so then we may as well forget about Marxism .
It would lose all credibility as the theory of the liberation of the masses of ordinary working people .
But this is not our view .
A proper understanding both of Russia today and of Marx ’s analysis of capitalism will reveal Russia to be state capitalist , not socialist .
Russia is not a superior social formation to those of the West but an imperialist capitalist power just as they are .
It can not be made socialist by just a few reforms here and there , but , as in the West , it will require a full - scale workers ’ revolution against the ruling class and the entire social fabric that preserves their rule .
To see why this is so , we must begin by looking at Russia today .
In Russia today workers exercise control neither over industry nor over the state .
The last remnants of workers ’ control over production , the “ Troika ” , was abolished in 1929 .
In its place stepped the manager whose orders were to be unconditionally binding on his subordinate administrative staff and on all workers . [ 1 ]
Trade unions were stripped of all functions , and particularly their right to negotiate wages .
An internal passport system was introduced into the country , and in 1930 all industrial enterprises were forbidden to employ workers who had left their former jobs without permission . [ 2 ]
Forced or slave labour was introduced on a massive scale as Stalin ’s terror campaign against the working class gathered momentum in the I 930s .
As the Russian authorities themselves cynically put it : “ With the entry of the USSR into the period of socialism , the possibility of using coercive measures by corrective labour have immeasurably increased . ” [ 3 ]
In Russia the state owns the means of production , but who owns the state ?
Certainly not the workers !
The Russian state was intended , by those Marxists who made the revolution in 1917 , to be a union of soviets , or workers ’ councils , in which delegates were elected from the workplace .
Today all efforts to start any independent workers ’ initiatives , let alone workers ’ councils , are suppressed and rewarded with extreme forms of repression .
As Kirov , Stalin ’s henchman , accurately prophesied : “ We shall be pitiless [ to ] those lacking in firmness in the factory and the villages and who fail to carry out the plan . ” [ 4 ]
Thousands of managers were imprisoned for not repressing their workers enough .
so it takes little imagination to realise the fate of workers who went so far as to demand some measure of workers ’ power .
Hundreds of slave labourers were shot down in 1953 for striking in protest at the failure of the authorities to carry out their promises that there would be an amnesty . [ 5 ]
The viciousness of this response is typical , and has been repeated many times before and since .
Even in bourgeois parliamentary terms the “ Soviet ” regime is a complete fraud : elections are a sham and the “ Supreme Soviet ” has only formal , not real , powers .
For instance none of the five or seven - year economic plans and none of the sharp turns in Stalin ’s foreign policy were discussed by this supposedly supreme state body until after they had been implemented .
“ Elections ” for the Supreme Soviet take place in constituencies where there is never more than one candidate ( nominated from above ) .
This candidate never gets less than 93 per cent of the poll , and sometimes – as Stalin himself did in 1947 – gets as much as “ 147 per cent ” ! [ 6 ]
So while the state owns production , it would obviously be complete nonsense to believe that the workers own the state .

The capitalist process
What kind of society is it then in Russia ?
Certainly it is not socialist , and certainly it contains no private owners of capital competing with each other - as is normally the case in the West .
First of all let us examine what capitalism is .
We encounter some difficulties when we attempt to define it .
These arise because capitalism is really a process , continually in motion , not something fixed .
Capitalism in the middle of the last century was largely based on a free market and production by wage - labourers within independent enterprises .
But this was not always the case .
In fact capitalism began in England in the 17th and 18th centuries with slave - labour and looting in the colonies as part of its base .
It also began with trade , but trade based on the vigorous intervention of the state and the denial of a free market ( the so - called mercantile system ) .
In discussing the dawn of capitalism Marx stresses not only the growth of the wages ’ system .
“ The discovery of gold and silver in America , the extirpation , enslavement and entombment in mines of the aboriginal population , the beginning of conquest and looting in the East Indies , the turning of Africa into the warren for the commercial hunting of black skins , signalised the rosy dawn of the era of capitalist production ...
Great fortunes sprang up like mushrooms in a day : primitive accumulation went on without the advance of a shilling . ” [ 7 ]
And instead of the “ invisible hand ” of the laws of supply and demand , in Britain there was a systematic combination , embracing the colonies , the national debt , the modern mode of taxation , and the protectionist system .
These methods depend in part on brute force , e.g. the colonial system .
But they all employ the power of the state ... ” [ 8 ]
That is why Marx warns us : “ If , then , the specific form of capital is abstracted away , and only the content is emphasised ...
Capital is conceived as a thing , not as a relation ... [ but ] capital is not a simple relation , but a process , in whose various moments it is always capital . ” [ 9 ]
Because it is a process , and one which contains contradictions , it is always changing itself as it develops .
We need to understand its dynamic – the underlying principle according to which it changes and develops .
Capitalism remains capitalism throughout its various changes because its central dynamic , its internal motor , remains unchanged , and it is to this that we now turn .

Accumulation : the key
The thing which links the early stage of capitalist development , based on monopoly , looting and slavery , with later stages such as those of 19th century private capitalism and 20th century state monopoly capitalism , is the nature of the accumulation process .
Marx thus characterises capitalism in The Communist Manifesto as where “ ... the labourer lives merely to increase capital , and is allowed to live only in so far as the interest of the ruling class requires it .
In bourgeois society .
living labour is but a means to increase accumulated labour .
In communist society , accumulated labour is but a means to enrich , to widen , to promote the existence of the labourer .
In bourgeois society , therefore , the past dominates the present : in communist society the present dominates the past . ” [ 10 ]
In his book Capital , Marx stresses that the motive force of capitalism is not the consumption of the capitalist , but the fact that in order to fulfil his role as a capitalist he has to accumulate : the capitalist ’s “ own private consumption is a robbery perpetrated on accumulation ...
Accumulate , accumulate !
That is Moses and the prophets ! ...
Therefore , save , save , i.e. reconvert the greatest possible portion of surplus value , or surplus product , into capital !
Accumulation for accumulation ’s sake , production for production ’s sake ... ” [ 11 ]
The drive for accumulation as a means to still greater accumulation , which is the essence of capitalism .
is due to two main factors .
Firstly , workers are separated from the means of production .
If they controlled production as a whole , it would be subordinated to use , to consumption .
In so far as they decided to accumulate , it would only be as a means for the further end of consumption .
Secondly , there is competition between the capitalists .
Without it each capitalist could decide freely whether to consume the surplus product , to accumulate it , or even to return it to the workers who created it .
It is competition which makes him accumulate and it does so by threatening him with extinction by rival capitalists if he does n’t .
That is why “ competition makes the immanent laws of capitalist production to be felt by each individual capitalist , as external coercive laws . ” [ 12 ]
Top of the page
Competition : the mainspring
But competition , which Marx saw as “ nothing other than the inner nature of capital , appearing in and realised as the reciprocal interaction of many capitals with one another ” [ 13 ] , is actually continually subverted by the production process which it creates .
For this increases the size of the capitals which confront each other , not only by ploughing back the maximum surplus , but also by reducing the number of independent owners of capital .
Competition thus leads both to the concentration and centralisation of capital .
Marx remarked : “ Today , therefore , the force of attraction , drawing together individual capitals , and the tendency to centralisation are stronger than ever before ...
In any given branch of industry centralisation would reach its extreme limit if all the individual capitals invested in it were fused into a single capital .
In a given society the limit would be reached only when the entire social capital was united in the hands of either a single capitalist or a single capitalist company . ” [ 14 ]
In Marx ’s own lifetime the dominant means for the centralisation of capital was not the monopolistic merger , but the conversion of an individual ’s capital into his part - ownership of a joint - stock company .
Of this process Marx said : “ This is the abolition of the capitalist mode of production within the capitalist mode of production itself , and hence a self - dissolving contradiction , which prima facie represents a mere phase of transition to a new form of production .
It manifests itself as such a contradiction in its effects .
It establishes a monopoly in certain spheres , and thereby requires state interference .
It reproduces a new financial aristocracy , a new variety of parasites in the shape of promoters , speculators and simply nominal directors ; a whole system of swindling and cheating by means of corporation promotion , stock insurance , and stock speculation .
It is private production without the control of private property . ” [ 15 ]
Updating this passage in the 1890s , Engels commented : “ Since Marx wrote the above , new forms of industrial enterprise have developed ... the old boasted freedom of competition has reached the end of its tether and must itself announce its obvious , scandalous bankruptcy ... in some branches ... competition has been replaced by monopoly . ” [ 16 ]
Yet , in spite of these clear and obvious points , apologists for Russia ’s present economic and social structure have taken an opposite view .
They have taken one stage in the development of capitalism , where there was individual ownership of capital and price competition , and then argued that since no such things existed in Russia today , no new social revolution is needed there .
For instance Ernest Mandel justifies this conclusion by saying that planning is “ a specific set of relations of production resulting from the suppression of the private property of the means of production and the beginning of the withering away of commodity production .
through which the labour performed in collectively - owned factories is recognised as immediate social labour . ” [ 17 ]
Taking the logic of this view seriously we would have to conclude that capitalism had ceased by the end of the 19th century , for as Engéls commented against those wanted to argue similarly in the Erfurt Programme : “ I know of capitalist production as a social form , as an economic stage : and of capitalist private production as a phenomenon occurring one way or another within that stage .
What does capitalist private production mean then ?
Production by a single entrepreneur , and that is of course becoming more and more an exception .
Capitalist production through limited companies is already no longer private production , but production for the combined account of many people .
And when we move on , to the Trusts , which control and monopolise whole branches [ of production ] , then that means an end not only to the private production , but also to the planlessness . ” [ 18 ]
The message is clear .
Such apologists for the supposedly “ non-capitalist ” nature of Stalinist Russia are entirely mistaken .
Nor are the consequences of their views confined to Russia .
For if they were right , then most of the West would now be wholly or partly “ non-capitalist ” too , for here too monopolisation and even the direct involvement of the state in the accumulation of capital has proceeded apace .
Already by the 1960s in Italy the state was responsible for the majority of fixed capital formation ; in Bangladesh it holds 85 per cent of the assets of what it has termed “ modern industrial enterprise ” ; in Algeria it moved from being the employer of 1.5 per cent of the workers in industry , construction and trade in 1965 to 51 per cent in 1972 ; in Turkey it was responsible for 40 per cent of the value added in industry in 1964 ; in Brazil for more than 60 per cent of all investment in the mid-1970s ; and in Britain for 45 per cent of fixed capital formation in the same period . ” [ 19 ]
Should we therefore conclude that Italy and Brazil , for example , already have a “ socialist economic base ” for the majority of their industry ?
Should we regard virtually all the other Western economies as “ in transition ” – many of them very rapidly – to such a “ socialist ” substructure ?
The real position is rather different .
Planlessness and private production is but one stage in the development of capitalism .
Yet for all that , competition is capitalism ’s “ inner essence ” .
Obviously competition must be able to take on forms other than price competition between commodities produced by private capital for an anonymous market .
Such considerations as these formed the starting point for the most fruitful developments of Marxist economic theory in this century , in particular Lenin ’s and Bukharin ’s theories of monopoly and imperialism .
Based upon these premises they argued that “ peaceful ” competition more and more turned into war , taking the form of physical seizure of raw materials , exclusion of rival capitalists by the erection of tariff walls , and so on .
It is impossible to understand the enormous expansion in the role played by the capitalist state in the 20th century unless one also understands that it serves to create competitive coercion .
That is why the form that the capitalist crisis has taken has changed dramatically since the I 9th century .
Then the ups and downs of the trade cycle periodically bankrupted sufficient numbers of firms to ensure that production could soon resume its upward spiral once more .
The monopolisation and “ statisation ” of capital on a world - wide scale – not just in Russia alone , although this represents an extreme case – has meant that today this is no longer possible .
Only a world war – and therefore a nuclear war – could fulfil this role in modern conditions .

Russia seen in isolation
How then does the Russian economy and state appear in this context ?
Two features , as we have seen , were necessary for the specifically capitalist tendency of accumulation for the sake of accumulation : 1 . The separation of the workers from the means of production , and 2 .
Competition between the capitalists .
Obviously the first of these exists in an extreme form in Russia .
It is more developed than in the West due to the increased powers of repression possessed by a totalitarian police state .
But what about the second feature ?
Overwhelmingly it is the case that within the Russian economy there is centralised administration of production .
Individual productive units have rarely been autonomous or in competition with each other .
In Western capitalism we are used to the attempt to plan and co-operate within any given enterprise , coupled with competition outside it .
Russia , considered purely on its own , lacks the mechanisms for introducing this competitive element .
As Tony Cliff has put it : “ The division of labour within Russian society is in essence a species of the division of labour within a single workshop . ” [ 20 ]
If any one capitalist enterprise , say General Motors or IBM , had successfully managed to take over the whole world economy , capitalism would have ceased to exist .
Competition between capitals would end , and therefore so too would accumulation for the sake of accumulation .
This would not , of course , be socialism , but a new class society – one which Bukharin characterised as an industrial “ slave - owning economy where the slave market is absent . ” [ 21 ]
This gives us an accurate picture of what Russia might have been like had it been possible for it to remain in isolation from the rest of the world – just like this but on a smaller scale .
What this means is that if Russia were unaffected by the world around it , it could no longer be a society capable of explanation according to the laws of capitalism .
Russia would have become a giant corporation in which the state had become the repository for all the means of production .

The beginning of state capitalism
But of course Russia never could have been isolated from the rest of the world .
Lenin was an internationalist not just because he wanted world socialism , but because he knew that the only way to get socialism anywhere , including Russia , was for the working class to seize power in the dominant industrial capitalist countries .
As he wrote : “ We always staked our play upon international revolution and this was unconditionally right ...
We always emphasised ... the fact that in one country it is impossible to accomplish such a work as a socialist revolution . ” [ 22 ]
Again in March 1919 , he repeated : “ We do not live merely in a state but in a system > of states and the existence of the Soviet Republic side by side with imperialist states for any length of time is inconceivable .
In the end one or the other must triumph . ” [ 23 ]
Lenin made it clear that the source of this incompatibility was not just the military intervention of the imperialist powers ( they had invaded Russia after the revolution ) , but Russia ’s economic dependence upon the surrounding capitalist states ; for he refers to the “ international market to which we are subordinated , with which we are connected and from which we cannot escape . ” [ 24 ]
The extreme backwardness of Russia in an age of imperialism forced it to industrialise rapidly .
If the revolutions in Germany and elsewhere had succeeded in the early 1920s , plenty of means of production and skilled labour could have flowed into Russia to accomplish this task .
But when the perspective changed , from stressing the need to spread the revolution internationally to stressing the building of “ socialism ” in a single country , as was proposed by Stalin in 1924 , the situation was completely reversed .
If industrialisation was to take place in Russia in isolation , this could only be by extracting huge surpluses from the peasantry and by forcing many of these peasants off the land into the mines and steel mills .
The Russian bureaucracy could only retain power in so far as it could succeed in this task .
It required a vast apparatus of terror to subordinate the consumption of the masses to the need of the Russian state to accumulate .
For a time Stalin tried to avoid this logic .
He allied with the right wing of the Bolshevik Party , which spoke of “ proceeding towards socialism at a snail ’s pace ” , without attacks on the peasantry .
But this meant that what accumulation there was in the years 1923 - 28 went into the social services , education , agriculture and food , rather than into heavy industry .
Little progress was made in these years towards catching up with the West .
An increase in international tension in 1927 showed the danger of this policy : without a more rapid rate of accumulation there was no way ( other than international revolution , which had already been ruled out by Stalin ) of defending Russia .
Stalin was forced to break with Bukharin a year later and fallow a policy which went for all - out accumulation , regardless of the interests of Russian workers – or , for that matter , individual members of the ruling bureaucracy .
This policy required nothing less than a counter - revolution .
In 1917 the workers had completely smashed the old state apparatus and replaced it with a new one – a genuinely soviet state – which was based on recallable delegates from councils elected by direct workers ’ power in the factories and barracks .
The new state therefore pre-supposed both the existence of factories and of workers .
The tragedy , of course , was that this basis of the state was itself destroyed by the failure of the international revolution .
As a result the workers ’ state found itself blockaded and invaded by the armies of 16 imperialist nations .
The vanguard of the working class left the factories for the Red Army , and the factories were unable to function because of the blockade .
Production declined to one - fifth of its 1913 level and the remaining workers deserted the factories for the villages because they were starving .
Without workers and without production , the new state had lost its social base .
For a time the Bolshevik Party substituted itself for the working class , with the perspective of helping the international revolution : for the international working class would then be able to aid the decimated Russian working class .
But from 1924 Stalin changed all that .
Not only did he seal the fate of the revolution by calling for “ socialism in one country ” , but he also destroyed the working - class basis of the party , swelling its numbers with former Tsarist officers , factory managers and so on , so that the party which had been more than 70 per cent working class in composition in 1923 was by 1927 only 30 per cent working - class – and it was completely bureaucratised too .
The Russian state was thus cut loose from its original social base .
Having become heavily bureaucratised , it moved decisively to take upon itself the role of achieving massive capital accumulation in the first Five - Year Plan of 1928 - 33 .
It did so because of the increasing pressure from world imperialism .
As Stalin put it in 1931 : “ No comrades ... the pace must not be slackened ! ...
On the contrary we must quicken it as much as is within our powers and possibilities ...
To slacken the pace would be to lag behind ; and those who lag behind are beaten .
..
We are fifty or a hundred years behind the advanced countries .
We must make good this lag in ten years .
Either we do it or they crush us ! ” [ 25 ]
The last vestiges of workers ’ control were eliminated from the factories .
Real wages were slashed and a general speed - up was introduced .
Peasants were forcibly driven off the land to become factory fodder in the cities .
The bureaucracy thus began a massive , primitive accumulation of capital .
The results were immediate .
Investment in industry expanded by six times its 1923 - 28 level in the years 1928 - 33 , and thereafter doubled in each of the succeeding five - year periods . [ 26 ]

Capitalist relations of production are imposed
In Russia , the subordination of consumption to the needs of accumulation took an extreme form .
From the beginning of the first Five - Year Plan capital accumulation absorbed more than 20 per cent of national income , and it increased in subsequent Plans . [ 27 ]
This was higher than any of the developed capitalist countries outside Russia ( but about the same as the USA and Japan in their equivalent periods of development ) , and shows clearly that this most characteristic symptom of capitalist – the domination of society by capital accumulation – was fully developed in Russia .
Accumulation , not consumption , thus became the goal of production in Russia .
Acting as the agent for the accumulation of capital , the bureaucracy emerged as the “ collective capitalist ” .
At the same pace , the Russian economy itself took on the same features as the giant corporations in the nations of the West , against which Russia was competing .
The bureaucracy ’s monopoly of foreign trade enabled it to seal off Russia from price competition .
But strategic and military competition completely dominated the process of capital formation in Russia from the moment accumulation became the bureaucracy ’s central concern in 1928 .
From the beginning of the Five - Year Plans armaments dominated the accumulation process .
For instance in machine - building plants , which are probably the best gauge of the development of accumulation , already by 1932 munitions plants accounted for as much as 46 per cent of the total iron and steel consumed .
By 1938 this figure had risen to a staggering 94 per cent [ 28 ] , and virtually all other machinery plant construction had ceased .
Accumulation in the period before the outbreak of the Second World War , in 1939 , was dominated by strategic and military competition with the Western nations .
After the war , this was even more true .
Between 1950 and 1965 approximately twice as large a percentage of the national income was spent on armaments as in the 1930s , even though the proportion of total income accumulated throughout the economy remained largely unchanged . [ 29 ]
The effect of this was that armaments were directly responsible for around two - thirds of all capital accumulated in this period . [ 30 ]
Since 1928 , therefore , not only has consumption been subordinated to accumulation , but in addition we can find the reasons for this in the competitive , coercive structure of world capitalism .
This accounts for the vast bulk of Russia ’s tendency to accumulation for the sake of accumulation .
It is not the desires of the bureaucracy .
then , which forces them to accumulate , but the logic of world capitalism .

The dynamic of Russian society
Basically Russia is like one big factory .
If it had existed in a vacuum the laws of capitalist development would have ceased to apply to it .
But that is obviously not the case .
Its actual behaviour is therefore based upon the same laws which govern the actions of other great corporations .
Of course we know that when such corporations get very big and : monopolise markets and so on , we have to modify these laws .
But the modifications are always on the basis of the original laws , and because of this they always preserve their basic tendencies and contradictions even if in a distorted form .
All this is another way of saying what we remarked upon at the beginning : that capitalism is a process in continuous movement , not an unchanging thing .
We identify it by its Inherent tendencies , by its dynamic .
That is why we look to Russia ’s accumulation for accumulation ’s sake , based upon competition with Western capitalism , as the key to explain changes in its internal structure - rather than the other way around .
If Russia is economically - speaking just like one huge corporation , then the familiar contradictions of capitalism must appear there too .
The Russian state capitalist ruling class is therefore constrained by just the same forces as apply in the West .
More and more of its own activities contribute to and suffer from the rhythm of the world market .
As in the West , only through a workers ’ revolution which totally destroys the power of that ruling class and replaces it with workers ’ power from below – and internationally – can socialism be achieved .
There can be no halfway measures or fudged compromises .
Russia today is not even a “ partially progressive social formation ” .
Its ruling class is as much a barrier to socialism for Russian workers as the ruling classes of the West are for Western workers .
