YUI CSS Grids : awesome , but useless ?
Jeff Croft asks if YUI CSS Grids has a certain limitation for sites wider than 750px , Dustin Diaz comes in and explains some interesting features and usage we can do using YUI CSS Grids .
“ One cool thing I ’ve done with it is made seven different templates with virtually the same html with the exception of one class name ( yui - t ( 1 - 7 ) ) .
It ’s wonderful because it ’s completely source order independent .
If I wanted a style switcher on my site you could take the approach of swapping out a className rather than a whole new css file .

Posted on 23 February 2009 by Quaid
I was n’t going to say anything .
I saw Marcus Nispel ’s Friday the 13th at about the same time as Shep , and , while I did n’t quite loathe the film like he did , his review said it all .
I did n’t see any need for another negative review .
But then I got to thinking .
There are a few things in the Friday the 13th movie that are worth looking at .
Not the acting , or the kills ( for the most part ) .
Not the dialogue or the portrayal of Jason .
All of those things are terrible .
And even though I did n’t enjoy the movie , I have to admit that , structurally , the film gave us something quite different in the horror genre , and it did it without becoming too self - aware .
FAIR WARNING : SPOILERS AHEAD
I think it all really stems from the fact that this movie crams the first three original movies into an hour and a half .
We get Mrs. Voorhees , we get potato - sack Jason , and we get our iconic killer .
When I heard this , I was interested in how they were going to pull it off .
The first movie is summed up in about five minutes at the head of the film .
We see a ( very creepy … I must admit ) Mrs. Voorhees track our last survivor down to the edge of the dock .
Our survivor chick hacks off the old lady ’s head and escapes , leaving a little boy Jason there to pick up his trademark machete .
This segment missteps in a couple of ways .
First , it relies on our knowledge of the first films to make sense .
What is Mrs. Voorhees mad about ?
We know it has something to do with Jason , but her motivation is never explained .
And if she is mad about Jason being drowned , why is he lurking in the bushes right behind her ?
I know , I know , the original has the same problem .
Is Jason alive or dead in the second movie ?
We do n’t know … but this is a logic flaw in a series of movies .
Each installment , by itself , makes sense ( ish ) .
It ’s only looking at them together that we scratch our heads .
By putting all this in one movie , though , there are some logic flaws .
A little rewrite and exposition could have helped .
But I ’ll get over it and move on .
This little sequence acts as a backstory for part two , in which a bunch of weed - obsessed campers go marching into Crystal Lake and meet potato - sack Jason .
They are dispensed with fairly quickly ( within 15 to 20 minutes ) , and we have the end of movie two .
And then the title .
It was a stroke of genius to hold the title for this long .
It ’s like saying , “ Okay , parts one and two were prequels .
This is a Jason movie , and here it is . ”
Which is kind of true with the original movies .
What everyone thinks of as “ Friday the 13th ” was actually an evolving set of genre conventions that did n’t really solidify until part three .
And even after that they kept growing and changing based on the times .
But back to Nispel ’s 20 - minute part 2 .
In it , we have a campfire story told about Mrs. Voorhees killing all those campers , and urban - legend - like stories of her son , back from the dead , killing people .
Since we have seen this a few minutes before , it ’s a cool way to show the legend of Jason growing and to be able to get to iconic Jason quickly ( had they chose not to replace him with an impostor , that is ) .
Again , though , it points out the flaw of the series … was Jason a kid come back from the dead , or was he really dead , and at what point did he grow into a man .
I ’ll leave it alone .
Then we move into the meat of the movie .
At this point in watching , I was already annoyed .
Jason does not set bear traps and hang girls over fires to slowly roast .
He just wants to kill ya .
That ’s the point of these movies .
Freddy played tricks and joked around , Michael stalked for days , and Jason dispensed with the bullshit and just killed ya .
That ’s what made Jason Jason , and not Leatherface .
Check out Shep ’s review for more unfettered bitching .
Moving on …
In the third and final and longest part of the movie , we see another group of teenagers getting killed .
Surprise .
But this is connected with the opening teen slayings in that the brother of one of the part 2 girls is now searching for his sister .
We all laugh .
She ’s dead .
Jason killed her .
That ’s what he does .
Only he did n’t , and that is a Jason problem and makes the movie even worse .
Our main male and female lead manage to rescue the sister from the bowels of Jason ’s batcave where she has been kept captive because Jason thinks she might be his mother .
Why he chained her up , we ’ll never know .
This is terribly dumb and convenient … but structurally it is interesting .
Because now we have two survivor girls and a main character who is a man .
When we move into the final chase scene with the three of them , anything goes .
Who will survive ?
I ’m going to assume if you ’ve read this far that you have seen the movie .
If not , turn back now .
So our “ main heroine ” of the third movie is killed with little fanfare , the we get two survivors .
Who are brother and sister .
This is interesting .
We ’ve seen the brother and sister thing before , and it ’s something I love about Jeepers Creepers .
But in Jason movies , if a dude survives it ’s usually as the love interest of the survivor chick .
Nice little twist .
Unfortunately , it is sullied by the obligatory pop - out - of - the - water shot .
I would n’t mind that in any other Jason movie , but in this it is silly .
It ’s pandering to an audience .
In the original Friday it was cool because we got a badass kid Jason .
In the second , it was a cheeky and fun twist .
In this it is just expected and obligatory .
So the movie is terrible , but it does some fun stuff with the originals and with the genre as far as structure is concerned .
Which makes me sad .
If the original Jason had shown up and the dialogue had been a little more polished and some of the nonsensical cuts were changed ( why do they escape Jason with their lives barely in - tact and then return to his lair ? ) , then this had the overall structure to be a very cool Jason movie .
Alas , it is instead a movie that played its hand poorly and turned out very very bad .
" Spotty Powder , " the Lost Chapter from Roald Dahl 's " Charlie and the Chocolate Factory "
Evidently , Roald Dahl did n't just kill four children in the original version of " Charlie and the Chocolate Factory . "
Evidently he killed hundreds !
For the sake of time and sales , his editor forced him to take out several murdered children , especially the British ones , sticking with two Americans , an aristocrat , and a German .
We now know all about this because of a lost chapter that the London Times found in 2005 , and which we have reprinted .
The lost chapter , titled " Spotty Powder , " was found in Dahl 's desk after his death , and it was written in mirror script : backwards , like Da Vinci wrote his journal .
The chapter was cut because it implies that Willy Wonka is not only a cannibal , but that he also feeds children their enemies , just like Polynesian islanders and Titus Andronicus .
Those who have read Dahl 's childhood autobiography , " Boy , Tales from Childhood , " will recognize familiar themes .
It is no shock that Dahl chose a headmaster and a future headmaster as a target for Wonka 's sadistic game .
But why did Dahl keep this chapter in his desk ?
Why did he take the time to copy out -- backwards , laboriously -- a chapter about the spoiled teacher 's pet Miranda Piker , her father , and their ignominious end ?
And how did she get her Golden Ticket ?
Was it confiscated from a troublemaking student who now sits perpetually in detention for his or her sin of joy and self - expression ?
We 'll never know .
My favorite part is about how the screams are really laughter .
And now , without further ado ... " This stuff , " said Mr Wonka , " is going to cause chaos in schools all over the world when I get it in the shops .
"
The room they now entered had rows and rows of pipes coming straight up out of the floor .
The pipes were bent over at the top and they looked like large walking sticks .
Out of every pipe there trickled a stream of white crystals .
Hundreds of Oompa - Loompas were running to and fro , catching the crystals in little golden boxes and stacking the boxes against the walls .
" Spotty Powder ! " exclaimed Mr Wonka , beaming at the company .
" There it is !
That 's it !
Fantastic stuff ! "
" It looks like sugar , " said Miranda Piker .
"
It 's meant to look like sugar , " Mr Wonka said .
" And it tastes like sugar .
But it is n't sugar .
Oh , dear me , no .
" " Then what is it ? " asked Miranda Piker , speaking rather rudely .
" That door over there , " said Mr Wonka , turning away from Miranda and pointing to a small red door at the far end of the room , " leads directly down to the machine that makes the powder .
Twice a day , I go down there myself to feed it .
But I 'm the only one .
Nobody ever comes with me .
" They all stared at the little door on which it said MOST SECRET - KEEP OUT .
The hum and throb of powerful machinery could be heard coming up from the depths below , and the floor itself was vibrating all the time .
The children could feel it through the soles of their shoes .
Miranda Piker now pushed forward and stood in front of Mr Wonka .
She was a nasty - looking girl with a smug face and a smirk on her mouth , and whenever she spoke it was always with a voice that seemed to be saying : " Everybody is a fool except me . " " OK , " Miranda Piker said , smirking at Mr Wonka .
" So what 's the big news ?
What 's this stuff meant to do when you eat it ? "
" Ah - ha , " said Mr Wonka , his eyes sparkling with glee .
" You 'd never guess that , not in a million years .
Now listen .
All you have to do is sprinkle it over your cereal at breakfast - time , pretending it 's sugar .
Then you eat it .
And then , exactly five seconds after that , you come out in bright red spots all over your face and neck .
" " What sort of a silly ass wants spots on his face at breakfast - time ? " said Miranda Piker .
" Let me finish , " said Mr Wonka .
" So then your mother looks at you across the table and says , ' My poor child .
You must have chickenpox .
You can't possibly go to school today . '
So you stay at home .
But by lunch - time , the spots have all disappeared . " " Terrific ! " shouted Charlie .
" That 's just what I want for the day we have exams ! "
" That is the ideal time to use it , " said Mr Wonka .
" But you must n't do it too often or it 'll give the game away .
Keep it for the really nasty days . " " Father ! " cried Miranda Piker .
" Did you hear what this stuff does ?
It 's shocking !
It must n't be allowed ! "
Mr Piker , Miranda 's father , stepped forward and faced Mr Wonka .
He had a smooth white face like a boiled onion .
" Now see here , Wonka , " he said .
" I happen to be the headmaster of a large school , and I wo n't allow you to sell this rubbish to the children !
It 's ... criminal !
Why , you 'll ruin the school system of the entire country ! "
" I hope so , " said Mr Wonka .
"
It 's got to be stopped ! " shouted Mr Piker , waving his cane .
" Who 's going to stop it ? " asked Mr Wonka .
" In my factory , I make things to please children .
I do n't care about grown - ups . "
" I am top of my form , " Miranda Piker said , smirking at Mr Wonka .
" And I 've never missed a day 's school in my life . " " Then it 's time you did , " Mr Wonka said .
" How dare you ! " said Mr Piker .
" All holidays and vacations should be stopped ! " cried Miranda .
" Children are meant to work , not play . " " Quite right , my girl , " cried Mr Piker , patting Miranda on the top of the head .
" All work and no play has made you what you are today . " " Is n't she wonderful ? " said Mrs Piker , beaming at her daughter .
" Come on then , Father ! " cried Miranda .
" Let 's go down into the cellar and smash the machine that makes this dreadful stuff ! " " Forward ! " shouted Mr Piker , brandishing his cane and making a dash for the little red door on which it said MOST SECRET - KEEP OUT . " Stop ! " said Mr Wonka .
" Do n't go in there !
It 's terribly secret ! "
" Let 's see you stop us , you old goat ! " shouted Miranda .
" We 'll smash it to smithereens ! " yelled Mr Piker .
And a few seconds later the two of them had disappeared through the door .
There was a moment 's silence .
Then , far off in the distance , from somewhere deep underground , there came a fearful scream .
" That 's my husband ! " cried Mrs Piker , going blue in the face .
There was another scream .
" And that 's Miranda ! " yelled Mrs Piker , beginning to hop around in circles .
" What 's happening to them ?
What have you got down there , you dreadful beast ? "
" Oh , nothing much , " Mr Wonka answered .
" Just a lot of cogs and wheels and chains and things like that , all going round and round and round . " " You villain ! " she screamed .
" I know your tricks !
You 're grinding them into powder !
In two minutes my darling Miranda will come pouring out of one of those dreadful pipes , and so will my husband ! "
" Of course , " said Mr Wonka .
" That 's part of the recipe . "
" It 's what ! "
" We 've got to use one or two schoolmasters occasionally or it would n't work . " " Did you hear him ? " shrieked Mrs Piker , turning to the others .
" He admits it !
He 's nothing but a cold - blooded murderer ! "
Mr Wonka smiled and patted Mrs Piker gently on the arm .
" Dear lady , " he said , " I was only joking .
" " Then why did they scream ? " snapped Mrs Piker .
" I distinctly heard them scream ! "
" Those were n't screams , " Mr Wonka said .
" They were laughs . " " My husband never laughs , " said Mrs Piker .
Mr Wonka flicked his fingers , and up came an Oompa - Loompa .
" Kindly escort Mrs Piker to the boiler room , " Mr Wonka said .
" Do n't fret , dear lady , " he went on , shaking Mrs Piker warmly by the hand .
" They 'll all come out in the wash .
There 's nothing to worry about .
Off you go .
Thank you for coming .
Farewell !
Goodbye !
A pleasure to meet you ! " " Listen , Charlie ! " said Grandpa Joe .
" The Oompa - Loompas are starting to sing again ! " " Oh , Miranda Mary Piker ! " sang the five Oompa - Loompas dancing about and laughing and beating madly on their tiny drums .
"
Oh , Miranda Mary Piker , How could anybody like her , Such a priggish and revolting little kid .
So we said , ' Why do n't we fix herIn the Spotty - Powder mixer
Then we 're bound to like her better than we did .
' Soon this child who is so viciousWill have gotten quite delicious , And her classmates will have surely understood That instead of saying , ' Miranda !
Oh , the beast !
We can not stand her !
'
They 'll be saying , ' Oh , how useful and how good ! ' "
COPENHAGEN , Denmark
The whole thing started with a hole in a fence around an abandoned military barracks in central Copenhagen .
Parents in the neighborhood tugged at the hole to widen it .
Soon it was big enough for their little kids to scramble through to play in the grassy open spaces within .
Not long after , squatters cut a large patch out of the fence and commandeered the whole barracks for their own use .
They named the area “ Christiania , ” stuck out a flag , and declared themselves free from the rule of Danish law .
Nearly four decades later , the flag is still flying .
This derelict army depot ’s run as a makeshift playground was short .
But it has had a long and often troubled run as a refuge for Copenhagen ’s fringe society .
And now the Danish government , which has been listing right in recent years , has given up on clemency for the collective .
It appears determined to finally dissolve the self - governing community of nearly 1,000 in what it calls “ normalization . ”
But Christiania took a preemptive strike late last year and filed a couple of lawsuits , which are now being heard by Denmark ’s Eastern High Court .
Decisions are expected at the end of this month .
The first suit cites as precedent a 1973 agreement that briefly allowed the commune to exist as a “ social experiment . ”
The second is , in essence , a class - action suit filed by the residents , claiming a right to live on the site without eviction , because they have now possessed it into the third generation .
In October , police evicted residents from a house on the rim of the commune , setting off a six - hour showdown .
Christianites lobbed beer bottles and Molotov cocktails at police , and were answered with sprays of tear gas .
Danes caution that if the court rules against Christiania in either case , more widespread rioting is a given .
The situation is more farce than tragedy , but Denmark is once again the stage for a pondering first posed 400 years ago by Hamlet :
To be or not to be .
• • •
For Danes , the question is a fiery one , igniting on one side deeply held principles about freedom , nonconformity , and tolerance .
A great number of Danes look to Christiania as the alter ego of the nation , and its right to exist is robustly defended .
“ In Denmark , everything is occupied and controlled .
There ’s not much space left in the cities , but Christiania is a kind of asylum .
People feel more freer there than in the rest of the society , ” says Rene Elley Karpantschof , a sociologist at the University of Copenhagen .
But those opposed are fed up with the deeply rooted drug use , the land occupation , and the snubbing of laws .
“ It has been made a haven for criminals from neighboring countries , like Sweden or Norway , ” says Jesper Nielsen , a cultural historian at Denmark ’s National Museum .
“ So you could say they accept a criminal form of control within Christiania , but they resist control from without . ”
Christiania , which takes its name from the Christhavn district in which it sits , began as a protest against the lack of affordable housing .
The far left grandly championed the squatters .
“ Christiania is the land of settlers .
It is so far the biggest opportunity to build up a society from scratch , ” wrote well - known counterculture activist and journalist Jacob Ludvigsen as the squatters set up .
Dilapidated army barracks were transformed into houses , and warehouses were outfitted with printing presses .
Kindergartens were created , more houses built , stores and clinics opened , and a local post office was opened .
No one paid utilities , rent , or taxes .
Money was doled out equally , and smoking hash was as common as blinking .
The “ Freetown of Christiania ” designed its own postage stamp , its own constitution , and its own flag .
It had its own currency .
It was known for its freewheeling lifestyle and funky , brightly painted houses .
Eventually , Christiania agreed to pay for utilities and a nominal tax per house .
But the area , centrally located and with a pristine waterfront , has long been eyed by developers .
“ When I first came here , I was Red . I was for a revolution , ” says Hjordis Oppedal , an artist who moved to Christiania in 1976 and maintains a studio there .
“ At first I did n’t like the drug users here , the addicts .
But I realized all people have rights and I learned to keep an open mind . ”
Yet the hard drug use spiraled out of control , and an underworld of dealers swooped in to tap the growing market .
What began as an anticapitalist utopia became a battleground of drug lords fighting for real estate .
Police began regular raids on the drug - laden kiosks along Pusher Street , the commune ’s main street .
Concerned that history was about to be swept away , the National Museum snatched up one of the infamous kiosks and put it on permanent display .
Residents say the days of hard drugs are over , but they keep a lid on exposure and strictly forbid photos and videos .
As one young Christianite mother , holding the hand of her blond toddler , explained recently , “ There are drugs here , and we do n’t want the police coming around . ”
The stalls remain , but police still sweep through .
“ Many people are ready to fight for Christiania , ” says Dr. Karpantschof .
“ If the state wants to continue to try to destroy it bit by bit , there will be a whole lot of unrest . ”
But the flag of tolerance does n’t wave freely .
Living space is at a premium inside the commune , so it is officially closed to new residents .
Tolerance is relative and random within the Freetown of Christiania .
Musician and artist Denis Agerblad was invited to take over the downstairs of a house for use as a studio .
But soon he found he had to contend with three teenage squatters .
“ It just happened one day that we had people pushing on the other side of the door , trying to get in , ” says Mr. Agerblad .
“ They were actually drilling and eventually got in .
As far as I know , they ’re still living there . ”
Parents in Christiana “ will do anything ” to get living space there for their grown children , he adds .

Christiania was born under a hopeful light at a time when Denmark was darkened by social problems .
The commune held out the ideal that there was the possibility of another possibility .
But its revolution is complete .
Today ’s Denmark is among the wealthiest , safest , most liberal , most socially articulate of nations .
Two recent surveys have ranked Danes as the happiest people in the world ( one by Stockholm - based World Values Survey , another by University of Leicester in England ) .
The nation ’s evolution leaves the Freetown of Christiania chained to the past .

I was reading an older article about technology and i saw the term “ Atari Democrat ” .
From the context I kind of deduced it was someone who is pro-technology , but I had never heard it before .
A quick jump over to Wikipedia and I had my answer .
The definition of an Atari Democrat varies .
A 1984 article for the The Philadelphia Inquirer , defined the term as “ a young liberal trying to push the party toward more involvement with high - tech solutions . ” [ 1 ]
It also noted that , “ Since July 1982 , it has appeared in the The New Yorker , Business Week , Fortune , Time and [ … ] in The Wall Street Journal . ” [ 1 ]
A few years later , in 1989 , The New York Times suggested that Atari Democrats ( also known as Democrats ’ Greens ) are “ young moderates who saw investment and high technology as the contemporary answer to the New Deal . ” [ 2 ]
The New York Times also discussed a generation gap which developed during the 1980s between older liberals who maintained an interest in traditional visions of social liberalism and Atari Democrats who attempted to find a middle ground .
I guess I was too young to have heard this term back in the 1980s .
I wonder what these people would be called today ?
Well , you learn something new everyday .
Now the Atari Democrats never had an official group meeting or anything ( that I know of ) , nor a symbol of their solidarity , so I threw this together as the new symbol for future Atari Democrats :
Do n’t think I forgot about all the Atari Republicans out there .
I got your symbol as well .
Get organized my Atari loving brothers and sisters .
It ’s time for a return to 8 - bit as a cornerstone of our future technology policy .
Who is with me !!

Google ’s announced they ’re closing or ceasing development of a variety of products as part of an already continuing move to keep efforts focused on other products with greater usage .
These include an end to video uploads to Google Video , closure of Google Catalog Search , Google Notebook , Dodgeball , the microblogging service Jaiku and the Google Mashup Editor .
Google ’s written officially about the closures and changes in these posts :
Ending uploads to Google Video makes sense and was long in the cards .
Back in 2007 , as part of the Google Universal Search rollout , Google Video was transformed more into a meta video search service than a site for hosting videos .
Video hosting has still been allowed since then , but Google - owned YouTube was clearly the leading property for this .
Google ’s checking for me on whether this means YouTube will lift limits to allow for longer uploads .
Generally , clips on YouTube have been only allowed if they are 10 minutes or less .
Google Video had no such limits .
Existing video content on Google Video will not be removed .
The Google Video site has a FAQ about the changes .
Picasa is another Google property that allows video hosting , added last October , but it also has a file size limit .
Uploads to Google Video will end at some point in the next few months .
Google Catalogs is a service that long ago was effectively abandoned by Google , and it ’s good to see them finally put a nail in its coffin .
Google told me that Catalogs started as a useful way to experiment with its optical character recognition technology .
These days , its OCR technology is more focused on Google Books .
Google Notebook closes , though those with existing accounts can continue to save material .
New accounts wo n’t be allowed , however — nor will the service be further developed , and the Google Notebook Extension for browsers will no longer work .
Google told me it makes more sense to close this when it offers other services that allow for notetaking , such as Google SearchWiki , Google Docs and Google Bookmarks .
Dodgeball , well , I never used it .
The service was designed to allow people to easily connect with others near them via their cell phones .
Google acquired Dodgeball with some fanfare in May 2005 .
Last April , the Dodgeball founders left disgruntled that further development had n’t gone as they wanted .
No exact closure date has been set other than in the next few months .
Jaiku is a micro- blogging service similar to Twitter that never got out of the invite - only stage .
The Jaiku code will be made available to anyone .
Jaiku will be maintained as place for people to post as well , supported by volunteer Googlers .
Unlike some of the other closures , there ’s no corresponding product at Google that Jaiku replaces .
IE — it has no Twitter competitor of its own .
Twitter competitor Pownce closed earlier last month .
Facebook was reportedly interested in buying Twitter , but the company was n’t interested in selling at that time , it was said .
That probably leaves FriendFeed ( founded by four former Googlers ) as the closest Twitter competitor out there , though arguably it depends on Twitter itself for much of its oomph .
It ’ll be interesting to see if Google decides it ’s interested in Twitter , given the Facebook interest — perhaps shuttering Jaiku is indicative of something more to come .
Pure speculation here , of course .
Twitter was cofounded by former Googler Evan Williams .
The Google Mashup Editor was a limited test product open by invitation .
Google ’s closing this , saying that its App Engine serves as a more powerful replacement .
Support for Mashup apps will end in six months .
Overall , the product closures are similar to what happened with Yahoo a year or two ago , when it had some products that never took off or multiple ones that served the same audience ( such as Flickr versus Yahoo Photos ) .
Unlike Yahoo , Google seems to be moving far faster to consolidate these things ( and without major internal criticism becoming public , as Brad Garlinghouse ’s infamous “ Peanut Butter Memo ” at Yahoo ) .
That ’s probably a positive — unless you ’re one of the few who really liked one of these services .
The closures come on the heels of Google writing publicly that it has laid - off 100 recruiters and may cut 70 engineering jobs .
Google ’s first - ever layoffs came last year , as part of consolidating its purchase of DoubleClick .
More recently , it was well publicized that it was laying off a large number of independent contractors and temporary employees .
Google engineers have long been at the top of the heap when it comes to the Google pecking order .
Now , neither products nor engineers seem to have a protected status , as Google goes into the grim economic times predicted for 2009 .
For more , see related discussion on Techmeme .
Postscript : Google contacted me to stress that they do n’t expect to cut 70 engineering jobs .
Rather , they have about that many people who might not be willing to relocate when three offices are closed .
They hope most will .
But if some can , then those people may leave Google — but the engineering positions will be filled by new hires .

For a world where going to a restaurant and buying a glass of water can induce bankruptcy in consenting adults , virtual dating might be the answer .
From one form of unreality to another ca n’t be that much of a step , until you try virtual dating .
You can hold hands , and kiss , too .
Five minutes after starting , a “ kiss ” button emerges from wherever kiss buttons come from .
The theory is that you can get to know people .
Well , at least you can get to know their avatars .
At first glance it looks a bit forced , but realistically , ( uh , I mean virtually ) , it ’s a bit less devastatingly kitsch - gruesome than you ’d expect .
Have to say I ’m a bit skeptical about a purple “ Flirt ” button .
I ’m reasonably sure that Valentino and Errol Flynn , who learned everything they knew from me , did n’t use purple Flirt buttons .
To be fair , with a bit of decent video profile detection and some more software , this could be Second Life meets Mills and Boon .
Second Life did n’t start out too flash , either .
Omnidate do have a point about one thing .
If you bump into someone who ’s glued to the Flirt button , and keeps spasmodically hitting everything else , you may not have to go through the whole ordeal of a Date With Doom .
( No , there ’s no “ Kill ” button , but I think you can delete everything if you want .
Romance is just a click , or several , away .
The clientele are interesting , too .
There are all ages , all types of people , and some of them are noticeably human , which is a bit of a change from the average dating site , where neither spelling nor plausibility is a real issue .
If while browsing profiles you get the impression that the Facebook / MySpace approach to profiles is n’t entirely dead , you ’d be right .
Everyone ’s American , apparently .
There are 6 pages of the most recent logins , heading back into the dim mysterious past of last week .
The women are interesting , the guys … .
Ah , who cares ?
There are guys , though , somewhere there .
Eventually , the idea is that you meet the person .
That , methinks , could be the problem .
From a virtual paradise to a virtual what , I wonder ?
Imagine meeting me without all necessary vaccinations , for example .
I remember meeting someone and a monastery joined them … self defence , they said ...
Apparently this meet and mix approach " empowers women " .
Since practically everything written in the last five years includes this two word vocabulary , I have some reservations about that .
Surely a sleaze is a sleaze , however " empowered " you are , and virtual Mace is n't the same thing .
On the other hand , the risk factor obviously goes down a lot .
Anyway you look at it , this site is getting hits .
The clientele are obviously enjoying something .
It may be that as the various things making physical dating too expensive and / or gruesome to consider continue to develop , this will be where humanity gathers in spirit , to press buttons .
Ummm… “ Flirt ” …
Where ’s that cute little Stegosaurus I saw a minute ago … ?
This is the genteel version of online dating .
Omnidate is a case in point .
You can have avatars which are approximations of the original humans .
You can sail through virtual places which look so nice that if real you would n’t dare think about entering , for the peace of mind of your wallet .
You can hold hands , and kiss , too .
Five minutes after starting , a “ kiss ” button emerges from wherever kiss buttons come from .
The theory is that you can get to know people .
Well , at least you can get to know their avatars .

ATLANTA , Georgia ( CNN ) -- Consumer advocate Clark Howard revealed to listeners of his radio show on Wednesday that he has prostate cancer .
Radio show host Clark Howard says doctors diagnosed him with prostate cancer in its early stages .
Howard is one of the best - known consumer experts in the country .
He has a nationally syndicated radio show and a new weekend show on CNN sister network HLN .
He also has written several books on consumer issues , including two that made The New York Times best - sellers list .
" I just wanted to give it to you right form the horse 's mouth , what 's going on with me , " Howard , 53 , told listeners Wednesday during this radio show .
The cancer was detected recently in its early stages , he said .
His doctors had monitored his health for about 2 ½ years after a routine test came came back with unusual results .
The test was a Prostate - Specific Antigen ( PSA ) test to measure antigen , substances that stimulate an immune response in the body .
If PSA levels are up , the chances of prostate cancer rise , and Howard 's levels were such that his doctor gave him PSA tests every 90 days to monitor antigen levels .
He also had biopsies to test for cancer .
The fourth and most recent biopsy found a " very , very small isolated pocket of cancer , " Howard said .
" Prostate cancer caught early is not a walk in the park , but is not really that big a deal , " Howard said .
" I just wanted to clear the air because rumors take on a life of their own . "
According to the American Cancer Society , one in six men will get prostate cancer in their lifetimes , and one in 35 will die of the disease .
Although its numbers are not yet complete for 2008 , the organization estimated that during that year , there were about 186,320 new cases of prostate cancer diagnosed in the United States and about 28,660 men died from the disease .
Among famous men who have been treated for prostate cancer are former Secretary of State Colin Powell , former Kansas Sen.
Bob Dole , former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani and actor Robert De Niro .
There are various options for treating prostate cancer , all with different approaches .
The American Cancer Society recommends considering things such as age , other serious health problems , stage of the cancer and side effects of treatment when selecting a method of treatment .
Howard said his main point in talking about his diagnosis was to increase awareness among men .
" Guys put themselves in danger by not going to the doctor , " he said .
He spoke to female listeners as well as the men .
" Be a nag .
Get your guy in to see the doctor , especially if you 're 40 and up , " he said .

Renewable energy needs to become a lot more renewable – a theme that emerged at the Financial Times Energy Conference in London this week .
Although scientists are agreed that we must cut carbon emissions from transport and electricity generation to prevent the globe ’s climate becoming hotter , and more unpredictable , the most advanced “ renewable ” technologies are too often based upon non-renewable resources , attendees heard .
Supratik Guha of IBM told the conference that sales of silicon solar cells are booming , with 2008 being the first year that the silicon wafers for solar cells outstripped those used for microelectronic devices .
But although silicon is the most abundant element in the Earth ’s crust after oxygen , it makes relatively inefficient cells that struggle to compete with electricity generated from fossil fuels .
And the most advanced solar - cell technologies rely on much rarer materials than silicon .

Rare metal
The efficiency of solar cells is measured as a percentage of light energy they convert to electricity .
Silicon solar cells finally reached 25 % in late December .
But multi-junction solar cells can achieve efficiencies greater than 40 % .
Although touted as the future of solar power , those and most other multiple - junction cells owe their performance to the rare metal indium , which is far from abundant .
There are fewer than 10 indium - containing minerals , and none present in significant deposits – in total the metal accounts for a paltry 0.25 parts per million of the Earth ’s crust .
Most of the rare and expensive element is used to manufacture LCD screens , an industry that has driven indium prices to $ 1000 per kilogram in recent years .
Estimates that did not factor in an explosion in indium - containing solar panels reckon we have only a 10 year supply of it left .
If power from the Sun is to become a major source of electricity , solar panels would have to cover huge areas , making an alternative to indium essential .
Precious platinum
The dream of the hydrogen economy faces similar challenges , said Paul Adcock of UK firm Intelligent Energy .
A cheap way to generate hydrogen has so far proved elusive .
New approaches , such as using bacterial enzymes to “ split ” water , have a long way to go before they are commercially viable .
So far , fuel cells are still the most effective way to turn the gas into electricity .
But these mostly rely on expensive platinum to catalyse the reaction .
The trouble is , platinum makes indium appear super - abundant .
It is present in the Earth ’s crust at just 0.003 parts per billion and is priced in $ per gram , not per kilogram .
Estimates say that , if the 500 million vehicles in use today were fitted with fuel cells , all the world ’s platinum would be exhausted within 15 years .
Unfortunately platinum - free fuel cells are still a long way from the test track .
A nickel - catalysed fuel cell developed at Wuhan University , China , has a maximum output only around 10 % of that a platinum catalyst can offer .
A new approach announced yesterday demonstrates that carbon nanotubes could be more effective , as well as cheaper , than platinum .
But again it will be many years before platinum - free fuel cells become a commercial prospect .
Fuel vs food ?
Biofuels , like ethanol fermented from maize , are the most infamous examples of the doubtful sustainability of supposedly renewable forms of energy .
This time the non-renewable resource at risk is the world ’s arable land , Ausilio Bauen of Imperial College London said at the meeting .
Again , there are potential solutions , but none that are ready for market .
Biofuels from cellulose or even lignin can be derived from inedible plant material and wood rather than food crops .
Algae , grown in outdoor tanks , continues to attract attention , and extracting biofuel from marine algae or seaweed could sidestep land use issues altogether .
Renewable energy technologies remain the great hope for the future , and are guaranteed research funds in the short term .
But unless a second generation of sustainable energy ideas based on truly sustainable resources is established , the renewable light could be in danger of dimming .

King Abdullah sends a Valentine
REFORM-MINDED
Saudis cheered when Abdullah became king four years ago .
The avuncular Custodian of the Holy Places , as Saudi monarchs title themselves , had a reputation for probity , tolerance and humility that augured change for the better .
Yet few of his tentative reforms have stuck .
Initiatives to modernise state schools and courts have stalled in the face of entrenched religious conservatives .
But in a move of rare boldness for the stately kingdom , on February 14th the 86 - year - old king decreed sweeping changes in government .
His reshuffle affected top posts in education , the courts , the armed forces , the central bank , the health and information ministries , the religious police and the state - appointed religious hierarchy , as well as the royally - appointed , 150 - man proto - parliament , the Shura Council .
It was not the scale of the turnover that raised eyebrows ; most senior ministers retained their posts .
More striking was the injection of reformist blood into the ossified school and court systems .
With his background in intelligence , and as a son - in - law of the king , the new minister of education , Prince Faisal bin Abdullah bin Muhammad , may be better equipped to flush out teachers who are failing to comply with curricula that have been revised to emphasise tolerance in Islam .
The departure of Sheikh Saleh Luhaydan as head of the supreme judicial council , along with several other senior judges , suggests a new push to modernise the courts .
Mr Luhaydan was notorious for rulings such as one that said it would be legal to kill the owners of TV channels broadcasting “ immorality ” .
During his tenure judges faced little pressure to adopt new rules meant to make the kingdom 's unique and often harsh forms of sharia justice more open and consistent .
Similarly , the sacking of the head of the Commission for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice will be seen as a response to a chorus of demands to curb the morality police , whose puritanical agents have often been accused of harassing law - abiding citizens .
Equally significant , the new appointments are markedly diverse .
The 21 - man board of senior clerics which issues official religious rulings , or fatwas , now for the first time includes representatives of all four schools of Sunni Islam , so breaking the monopoly , exercised solely in Saudi Arabia , of the arch - traditionalist Hanbali school associated with Wahhabism .
The body still excludes Shias , a minority numbering about 10 % of Saudis that faces widespread discrimination .
But King Abdullah has compensated in part by increasing Shia representation in the Shura Council .
A far bigger slice of the population that has been kept to the margins of society , namely women , also got a boost with the appointment of a female deputy minister , the highest - level government post yet to be filled by a woman .
Nora al - Fayez , an American - educated schools administrator , is to run the girls ' section of the ministry of education , a division managed until recently by Wahhabist clerics .
Should such personnel changes give an impetus to the deeper reforms that many Saudis long for , King Abdullah will have secured an important legacy .
But a quite different reform , decreed by him three years ago , may bear fruit sooner .
Addressing concerns that the line of succession to kingship , which traditionally passes between brothers before reaching their sons , would produce a series of brief reigns by dotards , King Abdullah created a 25 - man family council to elect future kings .
The council was to meet only after his own brother had succeeded .
But the current crown prince , Sultan , is in his 80s and said to be very ill .
In all likelihood , it is the council that will choose Abdullah 's successor , in what might prove to be , even if restricted to a handful of senior princes from the Al Saud family , the first quasi - democratic transition of power in Saudi history .
It would be a momentous feat .
But it will also set nerves jangling .
This abandoned Russian fortress is probably one of the creepiest places I have seen .
The reason for it to have such a strange look is because it was used later by Russian army to test the influence of Russian alternative to napalm inside of the brick houses .
Due to very high temperature of napalm the bricks started melting just like ice melts in the spring forming the icicles , but those icicles are of red brick .

MUMBAI , Feb 27 ( Reuters ) - India has not imported any gold so far in February as high prices dampened demand in the world ’s largest market for the metal , the head of a leading trade body said on Friday .
“ Zero .
There are no reports ( of imports ) so far , ” said Suresh Hundia , president of the Bombay Bullion Association .
India , which annually buys 500 - 700 tonnes of gold , had imported 23 tonnes in last February .
Prices in India have hit record highs over the past few weeks , partly reflecting a sharp depreciation in the value of the rupee that has made dollar - priced gold costlier .
The rupee INR=IN hit an all - time low of 51 per dollar on Friday , taking losses this year to 4.5 percent .
The currency had fallen 19.1 percent in 2008 .

Howell challenges
Hall in race for Michigan 63rd
Political newcomer Luke Howell wants to bring a new type of voice to Lansing .
Incumbent Matt Hall wants to use his experience to push for government accountability .
Remember the “ good old days ” of the Brady Bill and the instant background check ?
It turns out that the gun grabbers in the 111th Congress no longer believe these gun control measures go far enough .
Introducing perhaps the gravest threat to date against the Second Amendment : H.R. 45 Blair Holt ’s Firearm Licensing and Record of Sale Act of 2009 .
The primary goals of H.R. 45 are to license every firearm for every firearm a gun owner owns and regulate the buying and selling of firearms through licensed dealers .
To apply for a firearms license , the applicant would have to provide the following :
SEC .
102 . APPLICATION REQUIREMENTS .
( a) In General -
In order to be issued a firearm license under this title , an individual shall submit to the Attorney General ( in accordance with the regulations promulgated under subsection ( b ) ) an application , which shall include–
(1 ) a current , passport - sized photograph of the applicant that provides a clear , accurate likeness of the applicant ;
( 2 ) the name , address , and date and place of birth of the applicant ;
(3 ) any other name that the applicant has ever used or by which the applicant has ever been known ;
( 4 ) a clear thumb print of the applicant , which shall be made when , and in the presence of the entity to whom , the application is submitted ;
( 5 ) with respect to each category of person prohibited by Federal law , or by the law of the State of residence of the applicant , from obtaining a firearm , a statement that the individual is not a person prohibited from obtaining a firearm ;
( 6 ) a certification by the applicant that the applicant will keep any firearm owned by the applicant safely stored and out of the possession of persons who have not attained 18 years of age ;
( 7 ) a certificate attesting to the completion at the time of application of a written firearms examination , which shall test the knowledge and ability of the applicant regarding –
( A ) the safe storage of firearms , particularly in the vicinity of persons who have not attained 18 years of age ;
( B ) the safe handling of firearms ;
( C ) the use of firearms in the home and the risks associated with such use ;
( D ) the legal responsibilities of firearms owners , including Federal , State , and local laws relating to requirements for the possession and storage of firearms , and relating to reporting requirements with respect to firearms ; and
( E ) any other subjects , as the Attorney General determines to be appropriate ;
( 8 ) an authorization by the applicant to release to the Attorney General or an authorized representative of the Attorney General any mental health records pertaining to the applicant ;
( 9 ) the date on which the application was submitted ; and
( 10 ) the signature of the applicant .
( b) Regulations Governing Submission - The Attorney General shall promulgate regulations specifying procedures for the submission of applications to the Attorney General under this section , which regulations shall –
( 1 ) provide for submission of the application through a licensed dealer or an office or agency of the Federal Government designated by the Attorney General ;
( 2 ) require the applicant to provide a valid identification document ( as defined in section 1028 ( d ) ( 2 ) of title 18 , United States Code ) of the applicant , containing a photograph of the applicant , to the licensed dealer or to the office or agency of the Federal Government , as applicable , at the time of submission of the application to that dealer , office , or agency ; and
( 3 ) require that a completed application be forwarded to the Attorney General not later than 48 hours after the application is submitted to the licensed dealer or office or agency of the Federal Government , as applicable .
( c) Fees -
(1) IN GENERAL - The Attorney General shall charge and collect from each applicant for a license under this title a fee in an amount determined in accordance with paragraph ( 2 ) .
(2) FEE AMOUNT -
The amount of the fee collected under this subsection shall be not less than the amount determined by the Attorney General to be necessary to ensure that the total amount of all fees collected under this subsection during a fiscal year is sufficient to cover the costs of carrying out this title during that fiscal year , except that such amount shall not exceed $ 25 .
I have n’t had time to read the rest of the bill , but from this and the titles of the remaining subsections ( i.e. Sec. 302 Failure to Maintain or Permit Inspection of Records , Sec. 304 Failure to Provide Notice of Change of Address , Sec. 405 Inspections , etc. ) it ’s probably much worse than I think .
This is like a bad marriage between the Real I.D. Act and the Brady Bill .
If the Brady Bill was step 1 and H.R. 45 is step 2 what are we then left with for step 3 but the outright repeal of the Second Amendment and complete prohibition for individuals to own firearms ?
MONTREAL , CANADA / January 15 , 2009 - People travelling in Quartier Concordia along Ste. Catherine street or De Maisonneuve boulevard in Montreal can now look up and see a demonstration of innovative Canadian technology conceived at Concordia University : solar panels covering the top two floors of one facade of an institutional building - the new John Molson School of Business ( JMSB ) .
This world - first demonstration of this type of combined solar heat and power technology integrated into a non-residential building is also the largest solar - electric installation in Quebec .
Covering approximately 300 square metres , the solar panels will generate electricity for the building and heat fresh air during the heating season .
Integrating a combination of solar heat and power in a commercial building is a first step in the development of the next generation of buildings that not only produce energy for their own use , but generate enough power to provide it to the electricity network , thereby transforming buildings from passive consumers of electricity to net energy producers .
" The construction of the new JMSB Building provided our researchers with an opportunity to integrate state of the art innovative solar technology , developed right here at Concordia , into a building which will set new standards for construction , " said Judith Woodsworth , Concordia President and Vice - Chancellor .
This innovative technology was designed by the Canadian Solar Buildings Research Network ( CSBRN ) , led by Dr. Andreas Athienitis and housed at Concordia University .
The development of this new technology was funded by Natural Resources Canada 's CanmetENERGY , with significant contributions made by the Agence de l'efficacité énergétique as well as three industrial partners : Conserval Engineering , suppliers of the Solarwall ®; Day4Energy , suppliers of the photovoltaic panels ; and Sustainable Energy Technologies , supplier of the electronic components converting the solar electricity for use by the building .
" Our Government is committed to increasing the supply of clean , renewable energy for Canadians , " said the Honourable Lisa Raitt , Minister of Natural Resources .
" Investing in projects like this one at Concordia is helping us do just that .
" Construction of the new JMSB building will be completed next summer , with classes starting in the building in September , 2009 .
When it begins operation , the public will be able to consult an energy display in the lobby to view the real - time energy captured by the sun and used by the building .

Local ag - tech exhibit highlights trailblazing women
Amy
Wu has spent years researching women in ag tech , which culminates in this new exhibit .
It was a good year for Wired Science , and we have our readers to thank for that .
So , for the dual purposes of thanking you and patting ourselves on the back , here is a list of our most read stories of 2008 ( and a couple we think should have been ) .
1 ) Biologists on the Verge of Creating New Form of Life
Working with simple membranes and proteins , Harvard Medical School researcher Jack Szostak is closing in on creating a new form of life that might resemble the earliest life on earth .
It was probably a combination of the frightening idea of scientists creating new life forms , and a fascination with how life evolved on Earth that landed this story at the top of the list .
2 ) Key Molecule for Life Found in Habitable Region of the Galaxy
It was the unconditional love that Wired Science readers have for extraterrestrial life that boosted this story to just shy of first place .
In November , scientists discovered glycolaldehyde , a sugar molecule considered critical for life , in an area of the galaxy calm enough for planet formation .
3 ) Bolt is Freaky Fast , But Nowhere Near Human Limits
We piggy - backed on Usain Bolt 's electrifying speed with this post , which broke down the biomechanical limits of human runners and delved into the possibility that Bolt ( or someone like him ) could go even faster .
4 ) What 's Old Is New : 12 Living Fossils
Animals are always popular at Wired Science , and the stranger the better .
Purple frogs , ten - footed lobsters and three eyed beetles are some of the crazy creatures on this list of animals that have stuck with the same genetic plan for millions of years .
5 ) Secrets of Stradivarius Explained
This story explained how Stradivarius violins , considered the best in the world , get their pitch - perfect sound courtesy of the Little Ice Age .
6 ) The Lagoons of Titan : Oily Liquid Confirmed on Saturn Moon
Any time liquid is discovered on another planet , it raises the chance that life will turn up as well .
Saturn 's moon Titan , with its hydrocarbon lakes , is one of the most promising spots in the solar system to look for extraterrestrial life .
Jupiter 's icy moon , Europa , Mars and another of Saturn 's moons , Enceladus , are some other potential local harbors for life .
7 ) Forgotten Experiment May Explain Origins of Life
Continuing with the origins - of - life theme this year , an old " volcano - in - a - bottle " experiment , sitting on a shelf 50 years , turned out to provide new evidence that life may have begun near volcanoes .
8 ) Graphic Evidence Against Steroid Abuse
Gross !
There 's not much else that can explain why this one caught fire .
It has been viewed almost 300,000 times , which goes to show that people really like gross stuff .
The photo is of a 21 - year - old German bodybuilder who suffered severe acne and landed on the pages of the medical journal the Lancet .
We 've included the " before " photo here .
Check out the full story for the real grossness .
9 ) Mars Phoenix Tweets : " We Have ICE ! "
Wired Science broke the story of the Mars Phoenix Twitter feed and helped make her the tweeting star that she was .
We then turned around and used the her tweets to break the story of the discovery of ice on Mars , featured here .
Unfortunately our love affair with Phoenix came to an end in November when the Martian winter set and deprived her of her solar power , which we commemorated with our popular Twitter - style epitaph contest that received almost 1,000 entries .
10 ) Large Hadron Collider : Best - and Worst - Case Scenarios
We broke down how the LHC could affect the major theoretical physics ideas of our generation .
Turns out , though , that we did n't envision the real worst - case scenario .
That the world 's most complex machine would break within weeks of beginning operation .
11 ) Tricked - Out Inflatable House Provides " Instant Survival "
With the number of foreclosures skyrocketing , your own personal " bouncy house " complete with beds , heat , food , water and first - aid might not be a bad idea .
We found this emergency inflatable home called the " Life Cube " at the California Clean - Tech gala in November .
12 ) First Beam Circles Large Hadron Collider Track
In September , the colossal Large Hadron Collider , which physicists around the world have anxiously awaited for decades , sent its first beam around its 17 - mile circular track .
Little did we know it would be months before we'd get more action out of the thing .
Just a week after the celebrated machine started up , an electrical problem shut it back down .
The most recent estimate is that it could be back in action by
13 ) Top 10 Amazing Physics Videos
Nothing helps us get through a work day quite like one of Aaron Rowe 's nearly - patented top 10 video lists .
This one , covering physics , ends with the Large Hadron Collider rap , the best music video ever made for an atom smasher .

Here are two stories we think should have made this list , but somehow fell just short or slipped through the cracks .
1 ) Give
Thanks ?
Science Supersized Your Turkey Dinner
Perhaps you were too busy cooking your turkey dinner to read about how the traditional meal has changed over the years , but we think you 'll enjoy this story now if you missed it .
The size of the average American turkey has more than doubled in the last 80 years , at the expense of flavor .
The corn , potatoes and likely everything else on your plate this Thanksgiving has also changed significantly since the Pilgrims sat down with Wampanoag Indians , and even since Lincoln invented the holiday in 1863 .
2 ) Invertebrate Astronauts Make Space History
Sure it 's cool they shot these guys into space and some of them survived .
But really , tardigrades are just so damn cute !
Like a cross between a teddy bear and the Michelin Man .

Leading mobile phone manufacturers announced on Tuesday they had agreed to produce a standardised charger for the industry in a move set to save money for consumers and reduce waste .
Currently , each mobile phone maker has its own charger design , sometimes using several across different models , which increases replacement costs for users and leads to unwanted cables when a consumer swaps brands .
In a small move set to make this aspect of modern life easier , industry body the GSM Association said on Tuesday that leading manufacturers had agreed to link up to resolve the problem .
" This is a broad agreement that will move the industry to a single , energy - efficient charger for all mobile phones , " said Michael O’Hara , marketing director for the GSMA .
The standard shape to be adopted by more than 20 manufacturers including Nokia , Motorola and Samsung is to be mini USB .
The new charger will also be more energy efficient than current offerings , the GSMA said .
" The target is that the majority of mobile phones shipped by 2012 will support this new interface , " added O’Hara .
Manufacturers had been under pressure from the European Commission to produce a standardised charger .
EU Industry Commissioner Guenter Verheugen told German radio station Deutsche Welle last week that with over 30 different kinds of charger in use across the 27 - nation European Union , his " patience is now at an end , " according to local reports .
Introducing a one - size - fits - all charger might help the firms to cut costs since new handsets would no longer necessarily need to be sold with a charger in the future .
But the manufacturers will lose the revenues they currently make from replacements of lost or broken chargers .
My friends at Erlang Training and Consulting are running an organising an event in Palo Alto at the end of April : Erlang Factory .
If you ’re interested in the ferment of ideas and activity around functional programming , this promises to be an exciting occasion .
To me , one of the great attractions of the functional programming world is that our cousin communities are friendly to each other , and we ’re eager to transfer the most exciting ideas back and forth .
In that spirit , I ’ll be speaking about Haskell at Erlang Factory :
Although Haskell and Erlang are both functional languages , they diverge in many ways in their approaches to building software .
In this talk , we ’ll look at some of the key differences between the two languages , and show off some of the most exciting development and testing techniques that the Haskell perspective enables : how to write bulletproof , elegant code that executes with blazing speed .

Serbian ex-President Milan Milutinovic has been acquitted on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity in Kosovo by a UN war crimes tribunal .
Five former top Serbian officials were found guilty on some or all the charges relating to the 1990s conflict .
Their sentences range from 15 to 22 years .
It was the court 's first ruling on alleged crimes committed by Serbian forces in the breakaway region .
Mr Milutinovic was seen largely as a figurehead president during that time .
The court found that the 66 - year - old , who led Serbia from December 1997 to December 2002 , had no direct control over the Yugoslav army .
His release from custody was ordered .
UN TRIBUNAL SENTENCES Nikola Sainovic - 22 years Nebojsa Pavkovic - 22 years Sreten Lukic - 22 years Vladimir Lazarevic - 15 years Dragoljub Ojdanic - 15 years
Summary of judgment [ 137KB ]
Judge Iain Bonomy pointed the finger at then - Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic , saying : " In practice , it was Milosevic , sometimes termed the ' Supreme Commander ' , who exercised actual command authority over the [ Serb army ] during the Nato campaign . "
In the late 1990s , Milosevic 's forces were attempting to suppress the ethnic Albanian majority 's independence campaign in Kosovo .
The region , under UN control after Nato drove out Serb forces in 1999 , unilaterally declared independence from Serbia a year ago .
Mr Milutinovic and his fellow defendants at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia ( ICTY ) - all of whom had been allies of Milosevic - had denied all the charges against them .

His five co-accused were convicted for what the judges described as a " broad campaign of violence directed against the Kosovo Albanian civilian population " .
Ex -Yugoslav deputy prime minister Nikola Sainovic , ex-Yugoslav army general Nebojsa Pavkovic and former Serbian police public security service chief Sreten Lukic were found guilty on all counts and were each sentenced to 22 years in jail .
The charges included deportation and forcible transfer , murder and persecution .
Former Yugoslav army chief of staff and defence minister Dragoljub Ojdanic and ex-Yugoslav army general Vladimir Lazarevic were found guilty of deportation and forcible transfer and sentenced to 15 years .
The verdict is a confirmation that this process has been political

No hero 's welcome for Milutinovic
All five will be given credit for time already served in the tribunal 's custody .
Reacting to news of the five men's convictions , Kosovo 's President , Fatmir Sejdiu , told the AFP news agency he had " full trust " in the UN tribunal .
But Serbian Interior Minister Ivica Dacic , head of the Socialist Party founded by Milosevic , rejected the outcome , saying : " The verdict is a confirmation that this process has been political . "
Prosecution spokeswoman Olga Kavran told the Associated Press news agency that prosecutors welcomed the judgment , saying it proved Serbian forces had engaged in a brutal campaign to drive Albanians out of Kosovo .
Lost immunity
At the time of the conflict in Kosovo , real power lay in the hands of Mr Milutinovic 's mentor , Milosevic , says the BBC's Helen Fawkes in Belgrade .
Profiles : Kosovo trial accused Acquitting Mr Milutinovic , the judge said he was not among Milosevic 's closest associates and was not a key player in the ruling political party .
Milosevic died in tribunal custody in 2006 , before a verdict was delivered in his own trial , giving this trial much greater significance , our correspondent says .
The trial of Mr Milutinovic and his fellow defendants was the largest case at the ICTY to have reached this stage .
During the trial , which began in July 2006 , both sides called more than 100 witnesses .
Prosecution witnesses testified that Serb forces shelled towns and villages , murdered civilians and raped women .
Although Mr Milutinovic was indicted during the conflict , he served out his full five - year term as president until the end of 2002 .
It was only after he lost his immunity as president that he surrendered .
The responsibility has to fall on someone and when thousands are killed , leadership has to be held accountable

Readers ' reactions
In total , the ICTY has indicted nine of the most senior Serb and Yugoslav officials for crimes alleged to have been carried out in Kosovo .
Vlajko Stojiljkovic , a senior police official close to Milosevic , was indicted but committed suicide in Belgrade in 2002 .
Vlastimir Djordevic , the former chief of Serbia 's Public Security Department and a fugitive until his arrest in June 2007 , went on trial on 27 January .

I love hot and spicy food .
( You know , the kind that makes your nose sweat just the tiniest bit ? )
Wasabi . Chili peppers .
Lots of ginger .
You name it , chances are it ’s on my list .
These ribs combine two types of heat with red currant jelly .
The sugar in the jelly adds just the right amount of understated sweetness to balance out the heat — and practically guarantees that your ribs will develop a deep reddish brown crust .
A shot of mushroom soy sauce enhances the flavor , and adds all the salt you ’ll need .
Warning :
These ribs are pretty darn hot .
It ’s that slow kind of heat that creeps up on you .
If you ’re sensitive to hot stuff , cut way down on the chili sauce when you mix the glaze .
You can always add more once you taste it before you put it on the ribs .
I used beef back ribs for this recipe , but the glaze is just fabulous on pork ribs and chicken , too .
Fiery Red Currant Ribs : A note on ingredients
I like Trappist brand jams and jellies an awful lot .
If you ca n’t find it , use any quality jelly that lists fruit and sugar as the main ingredients .
If you ca n’t find Turkish Aleppo chili pepper flakes , you can order them from Penzey ’s .
A 4 - oz. bag is $ 5.45 .
For the hot sauce , I like Sriracha hot chili sauce .
You should be able to find it at an Asian grocer .
You can also order it online here .
Fiery Red Currant Ribs
5 - 6 large beef back ribs
1/2 cup red currant jelly
1 Tbls. mushroom soy sauce
1 Tsp. Sriracha chili sauce
1 Tbls .
Aleppo chili flakes
Serves about 2 as a main course , depending on how meaty your ribs are .
Preheat your oven to 350 degrees .
Line a sheet pan with foil and / or parchment and set it aside .
Fiery Red Currant Ribs :
Make the red currant glaze
Measure out the currant jelly into a medium - sized mixing bowl .
( So pretty ! )
Add the mushroom soy sauce .
Next , add the sriracha chili sauce .
Toss in the Aleppo chili flakes .
Whisk the glaze together with a fork until it ’s uniform in consistency .
Give the glaze a little taste .
If you held back on the chili sauce earlier to wait and judge the heat , add more now if you like .
Fiery Red Currant Ribs : Glaze your ribs
Line your ribs up on your prepared sheet pan .
With a brush , paint the ribs with the glaze on all sides .
( When I use a thinner marinade , I usually shake everything up in a large , zip - top bag .
For a thicker glaze like this , I like to paint it on to help ensure more even coverage . )
Keep going ’ til the ribs are covered on all sides .
If you have extra glaze left in the bowl , pour a little bit down the center of each rib .
Fiery Red Currant Ribs : Roast and serve
Pop the pan into your preheated oven .
Roast at 350 degrees for 60 - 75 minutes , depending on the size of your ribs .
Normally , an hour will do it for me , but these ribs were enormous , so I left them in a little longer .
They ’re done when they ’ve developed a deep reddish - brown crust and the meat comes away easily when you pull at it with a fork .
Mine looked about like this :
Serve and enjoy !

Rank Hotness With Newton ’s Law of Cooling
By Evan Miller
February 15 , 2009
Greg A. writes ,
I enjoyed your post on how to not sort by average rating .
I was wondering if you have any experience with sorting based on average votes over time to get a hotness rating .
Greg , I assume you mean “ hotness ” in the Reddit sense rather than the HotOrNot sense .
Fig. 1 : what Greg is talking about Fig. 2 : not what Greg is talking about
Neither concept of hotness is defined with any rigor , but I imagine a “ what ’s hot ” list should show what items , discussions , or products have gotten a lot of recent activity .
I ’m not going to analyze all the hotness algorithms out there , just my favorite .
I recommend a technique called exponential decay .
Exponential decay has three components :
Each new item has an initial “ temperature ” reflecting its hotness
The temperature is increased by a fixed amount every time someone gives the item a thumbs - up
The temperature gradually drops down over time
A hot list then sorts items by temperature .
As we ’ll see , exponential decay is great because :
It ’s easy to understand
It goes easy on the database
It can work without modification as your site gets more popular
First let ’s talk more about the mechanics of exponential decay .
Bumping up an item ’s temperature in response to new activity is the easy part ; but how do you figure out how much it has cooled ?
You first need to decide on a cooling rate , that is , how many hours it should take for the temperature T to fall by roughly half .
With that in hand , you calculate :
( Current T ) = ( Last T ) × exp ( − ( Cooling rate ) × ( Hours since last T ) )
( The exp function means take Euler ’s number e=2.71828 … to a power . )
The nice thing about this method is that you only need to write to the database when you ’re incrementing the temperature .
The rest of the time , for example when you ’re sorting a list of items to display , you can calculate every item ’s current temperature just based on its last reading , no matter how many hours ago .
That is , you do n’t need to constantly update the database , and you never need to process the rating history !
If you play with the decay parameters a bit , you should be able to show the right mix of new and hot items at the top of your list .
With a small initial temperature , you ’ll see fewer brand - new items ; with a smaller decay rate , popular items will tend to linger longer .
Graphically , here ’s how the temperature will drop over time .
The shape of the curve is always the same for exponential decay ; the parameters only determine the scale of the axes .
The choice of parameters is ultimately be a judgment call ( or not ; ask me sometime about A /B testing ) .
As your site gets more popular , you may want to tweak the parameters , but the same parameters should work fine over a large range of site activity ( i.e. , no matter whether the top item has a temperature of 10 degrees or 10,000 degrees ) .
Because the decay is exponential rather than quadratic or linear , even extremely popular items wo n’t get “ stuck ” at the top for too long after their popularity has peaked .
So in a nutshell , you will :
Pick an initial temperature for new items
Pick a cooling rate Pick a temperature increment
When there is new activity on an item , calculate the current temperature , then increment and record it along with the current time Sort items based on the current temperature using the formula above
And voila , you ’ve got yourself a “ hot ” list .
Another good use of this algorithm would be listing active discussion threads in an online forum ( where each reply increases the temperature ) .
One last note about exponential decay : besides being easy to compute , it ’s also the law that governs how any hot item cools down , from a hot brick to a hot tamale .
It ’s called Newton ’s Law of Cooling .

So you want research like this to continue to be funded ?
How do you stop bad research from getting grant money if you do n't know that it 's being funded .
I post great science and I post poor science .
Both are done to educate the public and make them aware of what is going on in science .
You do n't like this research ?
Talk to your government rep .
or e-mail the researchers directly asking them why this is so ground breaking .
The whole point of the news section on this site is to raise scientific literacy .
Unfortunately , not ALL of science is ground breaking and life changing .

The commenters here seem to be mistaking correlation with causation .
That cannabis use is strongly correlated with more nights out with friends DOES NOT MEAN that nights out with friends causes increased cannibus use .
As the article mentioned , there are several other variables that were nt accounted for in the study , that are more likely the cause of increase use .
I agree this was a somewhat pointless study .
However , the other commenters are stupid :P

Why not conclude that teens who use marijuana are more likely to go out with friends ?
person
Guest Comment Tue , Feb 03 , 2009 , 6:12 pm CST
No surprises here .
People who go out more have more opportunity to do things .
Using cannabis is one of those things .
In other news , people who spend more time in bed sleep more .
Great job .
Why is this in JAMA ?

Powder made from the ' velvet ' on antlers was tested Most complementary therapies used by people with rheumatoid arthritis are not effective , a study has suggested .
The Arthritis Research Campaign looked at the scientific evidence available for over 40 treatments .
Two thirds of treatments for rheumatoid arthritis and a fifth of treatments for osteoarthritis were found to be ineffective by the researchers .
The Arthritis Research Campaign said it wanted people who used the therapies to know what evidence was available .
The message is not ' do n't take them '
Professor Alan Silman , Arthritis Research Campaign Rheumatoid arthritis is caused by inflammation of the lining ( synovium ) of the joints .
Osteoarthritis is caused by the breakdown of protective tissue called cartilage in the joints .
Inflammation results when the unprotected bones of the joint begin to rub together .
It most commonly affects the joints of the fingers , knees , hips , and spine .
In total , 60 % of people with arthritis are thought to use some form of complementary medicine .
Antler velvet
The researchers looked at compounds taken by the mouth or applied to the skin .
Effectiveness is measured by improvements in pain , movement or general well - being .
When the researchers examined treatments for rheumatoid arthritis , they found 13 out of 21 complementary medicines were shown to have no or little effect based on the available evidence .
The 13 were : antler velvet powder , blackcurrant seed oil , collagen , eazmov ( a herbal mixture ) , feverfew ( herb ) , flaxseed oil , green - lipped mussels , homeopathy , reumalex herbal mixture , selenium , the Chinese herb tong luo kai bi , vitamins A , C and E , and willow bark .
However , fish body oil was given five out of five in the report , for being effective in reducing joint pain and stiffness .
In addition , six out of 27 treatments for osteoarthritis were shown to have little or no effect based on the available evidence Capsaicin gel , made from chilli peppers , proved most effective in relieving pain and joint tenderness .
But the effectiveness of glucosamine , a popular supplement used by people with OA which costs around £ 10 a month , which researchers have previously said was ineffective , again called into question .
For fibromyalgia , which causes widespread pain in muscles and joints , only four products were assessed , none were found to be highly effective with three medicines scoring two out of five , and the fourth just one .
Side effects
The researchers also examined how safe compounds were .
One - thunder god vine , a traditional Chinese medicine - was given a " red " classification , meaning there were serious safety concerns .
A quarter of the compounds were given an " amber " safety classification , because there were some reported side - effects .
The team said they were unable to evaluate the effectiveness of 36 therapies , including basil , green tea , sarsaparilla and St John 's
Wort because there was insufficient data .
Professor Gary Macfarlane , from the University of Aberdeen , said while different things worked for different people , " it is useful to also have the scientific evidence available and just as important to know how safe we think they are to use . "
Professor Alan Silman , the Arthritis Research Campaign 's medical director , added : " We did n't start this saying this was our opportunity to knock complementary medicines .
" The message is not ' do n't take them ' .
The message is ' if you are going to take them , be aware of what the level of evidence is ' . "
Dr Peter Fisher , clinical director of the Royal London Homeopathic Hospital , said the report focused on tablets and preparations applied to the skin , missing out therapies such as acupuncture and osteopathy .
" I think what really comes across in this report is how sorely under - researched this area is , " he said .
Jane Gray , president , of the National Institute of Medical Herbalists added : " This report is a commendable attempt to provide information on self help products for osteo and rheumatoid arthritis . "

We 've all pretty much become accustomed to the notion that Google is this invincible internet giant which will always be there for us , but it 's not always true .
A good example was this weekend 's fiasco , when ( due to human error ) Google 's search engine reported all web sites on the internet as unsafe .
Let 's face it : every web service , Google included , can mess up , and sometimes it means losing your data .
So , when was the last time you backed up the data on the various Google services you use ?
I thought so .
Let 's look at some easy solutions for extracting and backing up your data on popular Google apps and services .
Google Docs
There are several great ways to backup your Google documents .
One is a Greasemonkey script , called Google Docs : Download , that lets you download all of them at once .
If you 're looking for an automated solution , check out Syncplicity , which lets you sync Google Docs and your Office documents ( among other things ) .
You get 2 gigabytes of storage and support for two computers with a free account ; if you need more , you can get 50GB and support for an unlimited number computers for $ 9.99 per month .
Check out a more detailed explanation of how this works in one of our older Google Docs backup articles .
Another alternative is Zoho , a great online Office suite in itself ; one of the features it offers is importing documents from Google Docs to Zoho Writer .
Gmail
With Gmail , it 's easy : simply forward all your e-mail to another address .
Whether it 's going to be a different web email service such as Yahoo Mail or Hotmail or another Gmail account is up to you .
Furthermore , you can simply download all your e-mail via POP support to a desktop e-mail client such as The Bat or Thunderbird .
* Update : a friend just pointed out that it 's against Google 's TOS to use a POP3 account to grab all the emails from your account .
If you try that , your account might get locked by Google .
You can , however , use it to archive all the e-mails you 'll receive in the future .
Google Reader
If you want to make sure all of your feed subscriptions do n't just disappear one day , I suggest you create a backup .
In Google Reader , click on " Manage subscriptions " in the lower left corner , then on " Import / Export " , and then on " Export your subscriptions as an OPML file . "
If you want to back up individual articles , I do n't know of any good way to do it , but there is a slightly convoluted method you can use for emergencies .
Google Calendar
Bar Gmail , Google Calendar is the web application I use the most .
All of my errands are in there , and I do n't use any other reminder / calendar applications .
Needless to say , if I lost that data , I 'd be pretty angry .
Luckily , you can back up your calendar (s ) ; click on " Settings " under " My Calendars , " and then choose " Export My Calendars - Download a zipped file containing each of your calendars in .ics format . "
Of course , this is just a crude backup solution ; you can also synchronize Google Calendar with your Microsoft Outlook Calendar using Google 's official tool called Google Calendar Sync .
If you 're not a fan of Microsoft Outlook Calendar , you can also use a recent Google tool called Calaboration which lets you sync your Google Calendar with iCal .
i Google
Similarly to Google Reader , if you 're an avid iGoogle user , you want to make sure you 'll never lose your subscription list .
Luckily , you can also back it up in iGoogle Settings : click on " Export iGoogle settings to your computer " and you 'll get an XML file containing everything you need to restore the contents of your iGoogle account .
Blogger
This is as simple as can be : if you want to backup your Blogger blog , there 's a tried and tested tool called Blogger Backup which does exactly that .
Picasa
Backing up your photos from Google 's online photo storage / sharing application Picasa Web Albums is easy : go to " Tools " and then click " Backup Pictures . "
It 's unlikely that you do n't already have these photos on your hard drive ( and in higher quality ) , but if you do n't you should definitely create a local backup .
YouTube
Again , if you upload something to YouTube you probably have a local backup of the video .
If for any reason you want to download a video from YouTube to your hard drive , there are a lot of alternatives for downloading YouTube videos , and recently YouTube started experimenting with adding this option to videos themselves .
Any other Google services you 'd like to backup ?
Any alternatives for backing up data from the above mentioned services ?
Please share your thoughts in the comments .

Sidekick LX 2009 to use NetBSD as native operating system
There 's news on Boygeniousreport , Hiptop3 , and Engadget that the Sidekick LX 2009 will use NetBSD as native operating system .
What 's a Sidekick ?
Wikipedia knows that `` The Danger Hiptop , also re-branded as the T - Mobile Sidekick , is a luxury GPRS / EDGE smartphone manufactured by Danger Incorporated . ''
See the image on the right for more details and features .
After Danger was bought by Microsoft in 2008 , one would expect that their upcoming models will run Microsoft 's embedded operating system Windows CE as operating system .
Apparrently that 's not the case , and the new Sidekick will rather run NetBSD as operating system .
It seems Danger did too much work that they did n't want to throw away . :-)
So where 's the actual news from on those websites ?
Besides some " internal sources " , there were some job posts by Microsoft seeking a NetBSD programmer in several places .
I guess we 'll have to wait for the final product to hit the store to confirm this , unless we get hold of someone at Danger ^WMicrosoft to tell us what 's going on .
Nevertheless , NetBSD and its BSD license can be used fine in a commercial product like the Sidekick , it gives the company full protection of investment .
I guess when time comes by , we ( NetBSD ) will see how we can cooperate to support development and code maintenance , and also get the word out about another major company using NetBSD .

WASHINGTON , Jan 8 ( Reuters ) - The U.S. Senate voiced strong support on Thursday for Israel 's battle against Hamas militants in Gaza , while urging a ceasefire that would prevent Hamas from launching any more rockets into Israel .
The chamber agreed on a voice vote to the non-binding resolution co-sponsored by Democratic and Republican party leaders in the chamber .
" When we pass this resolution , the United States Senate will strengthen our historic bond with the state of Israel , by reaffirming Israel 's inalienable right to defend against attacks from Gaza , as well as our support for the Israeli - Palestinian peace process , " Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , a Nevada Democrat , said before the vote .
Noting that Israel was bent on halting Hamas rocket fire into its southern towns , Reid said : " I ask any of my colleagues to imagine that happening here in the United States .
Rockets and mortars coming from Toronto in Canada , into Buffalo New York .
How would we as a country react ? "
Co-sponsor and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell , a Kentucky Republican said before the vote : " The Israelis ... are responding exactly the same way we would . "
The House was expected to pass a similar resolution .
The Senate resolution encourages President George W. Bush " to work actively to support a durable , enforceable and sustainable ceasefire in Gaza as soon as possible that prevents Hamas from retaining or rebuilding the capability to launch rockets or mortars against Israel , " Reid said .
It also expresses an " unwavering " commitment to Israel 's welfare and recognizes its right to act in self defense to protect citizens against acts of terrorism , he said .
" It allows for the long - term improvement of daily living conditions of the ordinary people of Gaza , " he said .
Palestinians faced even grimmer conditions in Gaza on Thursday after a U.N. aid agency halted work , saying its staff was at risk from Israeli forces after two drivers were killed .
The reported Palestinian death toll in the 13 - day - old conflict topped 700 .
At least 11 Israelis have been killed , eight of them soldiers , including four hit by " friendly fire . "
SPY satellites have a new role : as well as watching us they are now spying on each other .
The Pentagon admitted last week that it is using two covert inspection satellites developed for the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency to assess damage to a failed geostationary satellite – something no one suspected the US could do .
If such satellites can get that close to a target , they could probably attack it .
The Department of Defense says its Mitex micro-satellites , which were launched in 2006 , have been jetting around the geostationary ring and have now jointly inspected DSP 23 , which was …

NYCartist - Was n't your fault .
I meant to link directly to the Exec Order originally .
Have now added that link .
Which is here , for the record .
Additionally , have added a couple of links in an UPDATE with some more explanation for you .
The one from Washington Monthly , in particular , offers the distinctions ( " translations , for ... regular people " ) that you requested .
Scott C. - I do n't believe I said that " pre-Bush rendition never involved torture " .
Though if it did , it would have been illegal , as Horton 's article mentions : " There are legal and policy issues with the renditions program , but they are not in the same league as those surrounding extraordinary rendition . "
He also notes that torture under the Bush program was " a felony under current U.S. law " and a reading of the Obama Executive Order ( as nicely translated by the Washington Monthly , now linked in the UPDATE above ) reveals how his order excludes the use of torture .

But the article you quoted certainly said that " The earlier renditions program ... did not involve torture " .
It sounds an awful lot like Scott Horton is making things up which means the LA Times did n't " get punked " at all here .

Educate yourselves people .
Remember that the bushbots are going to say or do anything to cause people to turn against Obama .
They are relying on your ignorance to achieve their goals .
Do n't be fooled .
RENDITION ( Law )
In law , rendition is a " surrender " or " handing over " of persons or property , particularly from one jurisdiction to another .
For criminal suspects , extradition is the most common type of rendition .
Rendition can also be seen as the act of handing over , after the request for extradition has taken place .
Rendition can also mean the act of rendering , i.e. delivering , a judicial decision , or of explaining a series of events , as a defendant or witness .
It can also mean the execution of a judicial order by the directed parties .
But extraordinary rendition is legally distinct from both deportation and extradition .
Rendition in the United States Rendition between states is required by Article Four , Section Two of the United States Constitution ; this section is often termed the rendition clause .
Now compare this with bush 's " extraordinary " rendition : Extraordinary rendition Human rights groups charge that extraordinary rendition is a violation of Article 3 of the United Nations Convention Against Torture ( UNCAT ) , because suspects are taken to countries where torture during interrogation remains common , thus circumventing the protections the captives would enjoy in the United States or other nations who abide by the terms of UNCAT .
Its legality remains highly controversial , as the United States outlaws the use of torture , and the U.S. Constitution guarantees due process .
Rendered suspects are denied due process because they are arrested without charges and deprived of legal counsel .

Yvonne -
Thanks for the additional clarity / definitions .
Scott C. -
The last graf quoted by Yvonne , specifically , refers to Article 3 of the UN Convention Against Torture , which is specifically denoted and recognized by Obama 's Executive Order .
If torture took place via renditions in previous Administrations , they should , of course , be held accountable for that .
But Obama has made quite clear that his version of rendition --- counter to what the LA Times indicated in their report ( and countless Wingnuts have since echoed as if it was actual fact ) --- specifically excludes torture , as per the UN conventions , and in contravention of Bush 's " extraordinary rendition " which clearly allowed it , in violation of the conventions and treaties in which the U.S. is a signatory .
I 'd have to agree w/ Horton 's ( and others ) conclusion .
The LA Times either " got punked " or knowingly mislead readers .
Your anectodal , historical allegation does not seem to have anything to do with that question .
At all .

I never believed the LA Times story when I first read of it .
I have zero confidence in mainstream news media giving people accurate and truthful information .
The owners of most of these newspapers and media outlets are really primarily out to manipulate public opinion to further the media owners ' other more lucrative business interests , such as the of supply weapons of war and making war .
That is where their real money is made .

Disinformation is a powerful tool .
Look at who now owns the LA Times .
What more would expect ?
As far as reporting goes , your link is directly to the White House website .
How much real investigative reporting would have it taken to have read the order ?
Perhaps MSM really means Mainly Slipshod Media .

The LA Times story was printed for the same reason any article is printed in mainstream newspapers : it sells newspapers .
It just so happens that what 's hot right now is portraying Obama as a hypocrite , or trying to show that he is n't living up to his promises .
I would n't be surprised if we continue to see this kind of stuff even from not - so - rightwing publications .
A large part of the left is even expecting Obama to fail , and it might cause some to jump the gun .

Considering he 's only been in office 12 - 13 days , the fascist media is going to club every baby seal they can in 2009 .
Which is why I would like to see the FCC force the " public files " of all stations available online for citizens to make complaints , comments , or compliments .
This way with enough lies a station would be denied renewal .
ENDING ONE PART OF THE ABUSIVE USE OF ELECTRONICS .
Others include :
Electronic Stun Guns
Microwave Pain Weapons
Electronic Vote Tabulation Devices
Electronic Vote Registration Poll Books
Electronic Medical Records
RFID ID / Passport / DL / Credit Card
Electronic Database Exploits
NSA FIOS Splitters
There really are some things that good old face to face interaction and plain paper documents should be used for .
While an accredited journalist should be someone we all respect , today the reverse seems to be true .
I would have to ask , who truly has the authority to accredit a journalist ?
Seems pretty much like the same kind of question about Witch initiation .
Can one be initiated by anyone other than another Witch ?
Chicken and Egg , can one initiate oneself .
And what to do about initiations in DANGEROUS CULTS ( Do Click the Link ) such as the corporate fascist media has become - - a cult .
I find myself turned away , because instead of making a profit at what I do , I PAY FOR IT AND GIVE IT AWAY FREE .
So is that a requirement of journalist initiation ?
MUST BE MAKING MONEY ?
I say BS .
Another time I looked into this and there were accredited journalist / media pass being generated at the POLICE STATION .
This is fucking insane !
If not over the top dangerous .
Already we have media blackouts , spin , and lies .
ZERO ACCOUNTABILITY .
People like " Media Matters " ain't doing shit .
They need a BITE to their work .
They do n't have a bite .
Sometimes they do n't have EARS .
( I submitted shit to them and ZERO response , they could have at least acknowledge I am a human .
But nothing . )
A lot of times I go there and it's the same shit .
I do n't even bother reading it anymore .
Oh Michael Savage bla bla bla , Oh Rush blAGH bLagh Perhaps with the complete fucking lack of ethics in media there should be instead of bars and tone a fucking disclaimer saying , " The following hour of CBS , NBC , ABC , FOX , PBS programming is entertainment , and not reality , even though accredited journalists are producing it . "
I will stick to my Music , and occasional fucking local politics .
But you know what , I have more integrity that some accredited journalists , even though I do n't fully understand the rules of their game .
( sheez this feels long winded , hopefully angry )

( While checking Michael Gordon 's name , I lost my draft ... )
Does n't some of the problem ( ease in doing " punking " ) reflect the lay - offs of staff at the LATimes and other places ?
Will we get back to naming sources ?
Something Earl Caldwell , journalist , of " The Caldwell Chronicle " on WBAI mentions frequently .
http://www.wbai.org
On the other hand , the NYTimes " punked " itself ( if I may expand the usage ) in the run up to the attack on Iraq in stories by Judith Miller and Michael Gordon ( ? ) , such as source : Curveball and the other story , aluminum tubes for missile parts .
I first heard the " punked " renditions story on DemocracyNow headlines , which suggests to me that punked stories travel far and fast .

SACRAMENTO —
After months of dire warnings and a week of round - the - clock arm - twisting , Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger this afternoon signed a $ 41 billion budget package of steep tax increases and spending cuts .
That simple act capped a drawn - out drama to keep the state from going broke .
There is something in the package sure to offend nearly everyone : fed - up voters , tax - averse conservatives , labor unions , environmentalists , educators and local officials worried about how to keep the fraying social safety net from snapping .
The deal also could end the political careers of the handful of Republican legislators who joined fractious Democrats to vote “ aye ” as the sun rose Thursday .
In a statement released immediately after he formally signed the budget just before 2 pm , Schwarzenegger said : “ We have achieved a great victory for California today .
During a down economy and facing an historic budget deficit , we had to make some very difficult decisions , but I am very proud that California is back on the best path forward . ”
But on Thursday , even as he thanked the Legislature for its “ difficult but courageous ” vote , the governor acknowledged that much remained to be done .
“ Our work is not over , ” he said , referring to a soon - to - be launched campaign to pass ballot measures that were tied to the budget vote .
The three - month standoff halted funding for public works projects across California , delayed refunds for millions of taxpayers , forced unpaid furloughs on thousands of state workers and caused the state ’s credit rating to be downgraded , rendering it virtually unable to borrow money .
The breakthrough , after more than five days of sometimes round - the - clock negotiations in the Legislature , came about 1 a.m. Thursday , when top Senate Democrats agreed to GOP Sen .
Abel Maldonado ’s demands in exchange for his deciding vote .
Among them : ballot measures that would do away with partisan primaries and block pay raises for lawmakers when the state is running a deficit .
Maldonado , a moderate Republican whose district includes parts of Silicon Valley , also forced through a last - minute agreement to trim the package ’s tax hikes to $ 12.8 billion by eliminating a 12 - cents - a - gallon excise on gasoline ; the difference will be made up with California ’s share of federal economic stimulus money and with expected line - item vetoes by Schwarzenegger .
One Assembly member called the deal “ blackmail , extortion and skulduggery . ”
Another labeled it “ political ransom . ”
Senate President Pro Tem Darrell Steinberg , D - Sacramento — who Tuesday had ordered that legislators be locked inside the Capitol building until they forged a deal — at one point ordered recalcitrant Democrats into his office one by one to try to win their cooperation .
Open primaries
Even so , when the Senate resumed session about 3:40 a.m. , four Democrats initially refused to vote for Maldonado ’s open - primary measure , which will be put before voters in June 2010 .
Advocates say the proposal could break partisan deadlock by giving more power to moderate voices , but both parties fear it could endanger safe seats .
The idea has been shot down twice in California in the past decade : once by the U.S. Supreme Court and , more recently , in 2004 , when voters rejected Proposition 62 .
Sen. Gloria Romero , D - Los Angeles , was near tears as she called her party ’s capitulation to Maldonado “ a disgusting process . ”
Yet she , like the other holdouts , changed her vote to yes , and the Senate approved the open - primary measure just before 5 a.m .
The state Assembly passed the measure at 6:30 a.m.
Assembly GOP leader Mike Villines of Fresno , Roger Niello of Sacramento and Anthony Adams of Claremont provided the three Republican votes needed to put the budget over the two - thirds threshold .
Mere hours after the vote , Adams was targeted by a conservative group that vowed to mount a recall campaign against him .
Yet bleary - eyed lawmakers traded smiles and hugs when the more than two dozen bills in the budget package had finally passed , and the state ’s historic standoff came to an end .
Tax refunds and billions of dollars in other payments that had been held up because the state could not cover the checks will soon be on track to be released .
State Controller John Chiang ’s office is awaiting the state Department of Finance to provide details of the budget , which are expected in about a week , before determining when payments can resume
$ 1 billion reserve
The budget is intended to close a projected $ 40 billion deficit through mid-2010 and establish a $ 1 billion rainy - day reserve .
The plan includes a 1 - cent - on - the - dollar sales tax hike , increased income taxes , deep cuts to education and social services and fast - tracked environmental review for some state construction projects .
Also tucked in was a controversial tax break that benefits the high - tech and biotech industries — sure to be a boon for Silicon Valley .
Besides the ballot measures agreed to at Maldonado ’s behest , parts of the plan depend on other measures voters will be asked to approve in a special election in May .
One would seek to expand the state lottery and borrow $ 5 billion against the increased revenue .
Another would impose a cap on state spending of roughly 4 percent to 6 percent annually .
If voters approve the spending limit , most of the taxes would last for four years .
If it fails , the taxes would expire after two years .
The overall budget deal involved major trade - offs for both parties that they would never have agreed to absent the state ’s financial crisis .
“ I do n’t think anybody ’s happy with this , ” said Sen .
Denise Moreno Ducheny , D - Chula Vista , ﻿” other than we get to go home and sleep . ”
Contact Mike Zapler at mzapler@mercurynews.com or ( 916 ) 441-4603 .
It would n't be wise for a new administration to come in , take over a case from a prosecutor , and completely change a legal strategy in mid-course without a more thorough review of the national security implications .
And , of course , the invocation itself is n't necessarily an issue ; civil libertarians and others who voted for Obama did so with the belief that his judgment and his attorney general would be better stewards of that privilege than President Bush and his attorney generals ( and vice president . )
Obama certainly never promised Americans that he 'd declassify everything , or that the government had to renounce its right to assert a state secrets privilege forever .
According to the Justice Department , AG Holder is reviewing all state secrets claims to make sure they meet certain legal tests .
The ACLU is outraged .
Executive Director Patrick Romero said that " [ c ] andidate Obama ran on a platform that would reform the abuse of state secrets , but President Obama 's Justice Department has disappointingly reneged on that important civil liberties issue .
If this is a harbinger of things to come , it will be a long and arduous road to give us back an America we can be proud of again . "

When used effectively , JavaScript debuggers help find and squash errors in your JavaScript code .
To become an advanced JavaScript debugger , you ’ll need to know about the debuggers available to you , the typical JavaScript debugging workflow , and code requirements for effective debugging .
In this article , we ’ll discuss advanced debugging techniques for diagnosing and treating bugs using a sample web application .
Article Continues Below
On accessibility #section2
This article highlights strengths and differences between debugging tools , and shows how we perform advanced JavaScript debugging tasks .
Our methods often rely on the mouse ; if you prefer to use keyboard shortcuts , or if you rely on assistive technologies such as screen readers to interact with these tools , you should consult the relevant documentation to determine how ( or if ) these tools will work for you .
The debuggers #section3
With an increasing selection of good debuggers available , JavaScript programmers can gain a lot from learning how to use them .
JavaScript debugger user interfaces ( UIs ) are becoming more polished , more standardized across products , and easier to use , thus making it easier for both experts and novices to learn JavaScript debugging .
Currently , there are debugging tools available for all major web browsers .
Currently , Firebug and Dragonfly are the most stable options .
IE8 ’s beta tools sometimes ignore breakpoints , and at the time this article was written , WebInspector seemed to have compatibility issues with the nightly builds of Webkit .
Familiarize yourself with multiple debugging tools — you never know in which browser the next bug will arise .
Since the debuggers are roughly comparable in functionality , it ’s easy to switch between them once you know how to use one .
Debugging workflow #section4
When investigating a specific problem , you will usually follow this process :
Find the relevant code in the debugger ’s code view pane .
Set breakpoint (s ) where you think interesting things may occur .
Run the script again by reloading the page in the browser if it ’s an inline script , or by clicking a button if it ’s an event handler .
Wait until the debugger pauses execution and makes it possible to step through the code .
Investigate the values of variables .
For example , look for variables that are undefined when they should contain a value , or return “ false ” when you expect them to return “ true . ”
If necessary , use the command line to evaluate code or change variables for testing .
Find the problem by learning which piece of code or input caused the error conditions .
To create a breakpoint , you can also add the statement debugger to your code :
function frmSubmit( event ) { event = event || window.event ; debugger ; var form = this ; }
Debugger requirements #section5
Most debuggers require well - formatted code .
Scripts written on one line make it difficult to spot errors in line - by - line debuggers .
Obfuscated code can be hard to debug , especially code that has been “ packed ” and needs to be unpacked using eval ( ) .
Many JavaScript libraries allow you to choose between packed / obfuscated and well - formatted versions , making it easy to use formatted code for debugging .
Debugging demo#section6
Let ’s start with a small , bug - ridden example , to learn how to diagnose and treat each ailment in turn .
Our example is a web application login screen .
Imagine you ’re working on this fabulous new web application , and your testers ask you to investigate this list of bugs :
The “ Loading … ” status bar message does not disappear when the application finishes loading .
The language defaults to Norwegian even in English versions of Firefox and IE .
A global variable named prop is created somewhere .
In the DOM viewer , all elements have a “ clone ” attribute .
“ Minimum length ” form validation does n’t work — trying to submit the form with a one - letter user name should cause an error message .
Leaving the password field blank is allowed — you should see an error message saying that the password field may not be empty , on submitting the form .
The login always fails , with an error message saying that a cross - site request forgery attack was detected .
Launching debuggers #section7
In Firefox you need to make sure you have the Firebug extension installed .
Select “ Tools > Firebug > Open Firebug ” to get started .
In Opera 9.5 beta 2 or later , choose “ Tools > Advanced > Developer Tools . ”
In IE8 beta , choose “ Tools > Developer Tools . ”
beta , choose “ Tools > Developer Tools . ”
In Safari or WebKit , first enable the debug menu , then choose “ Debug > Show Web Inspector . ”
It ’s time to fire up the debuggers .
To follow the demo , pay close attention to the step - by - step instructions throughout the remainder of the article .
Since some instructions involve modifying the code , you may want to save the page locally and load it from your file system before starting .
Bug one : the “ Loading … ” message in the status bar#section8
If you look at the debugging applications in Dragonfly and Firebug , you ’ll get an initial view as seen in figure one .
fig .
1 : the initial view of our application ’s JavaScript in Dragonfly and Firebug , respectively .
When you look at the source code in the debugger , note that there is a function clearLoading Message ( ) defined at the top of the code .
This seems like a good place to set a breakpoint .
Here ’s how to do it :
Click the line number in the left margin to set a breakpoint on the first line inside the function clearLoading Message ( ) .
Reload the page .
Note : the breakpoint must be set on a line with code that will execute when the function runs .
The line that contains function clearLoading Message ( ) { is just the function signature .
Setting a breakpoint there will never actually cause the debugger to stop .
Set your breakpoint on the first line inside the function instead .
When the page is reloaded , script execution stops at the breakpoint and you ’ll see an output like the one shown in figure two .
( Dragonfly is shown at the top , Firebug at the bottom . )
fig .
2 : the debuggers stopped at a breakpoint inside clearLoading Message .
Let ’s step through the function .
You ’ll see that it updates two DOM elements , and on line 28 it mentions the word statusbar .
That looks significant .
It ’s likely that getElements ( ‘ p ’ , {'class ' :' statusbar'} ) [ 0 ] will find the statusbar element in the DOM .
Is there a way you can test that theory quickly ?
Paste the relevant snippet into the command line to check your theory .
Figure three shows three screenshots ( Dragonfly , Firebug , and IE8 ) after reading the innerHTML or outerHTML of the element returned by the command you ’re investigating .
To test this assumption :
Find the command line :
In Firebug , switch to the “ Console ” tab .
In Dragonfly , look below the JavaScript source code pane .
In IE8 Developer Tools , find the tab on the right labeled “ Console . ” Paste getElements ( ‘ p ’ , {'class ' :' statusbar'} ) [ 0 ] .innerHTML into the command line .
Press enter .
fig . 3 : output shown in Dragonfly , Firebug , and IE8 , respectively .
The command line is a very useful tool that allows you to test small script snippets quickly .
Firebug ’s console integration is very useful — if your command outputs an object , you get an intelligent view .
For example , you get a markup - like representation if it is a DOM object .
You can use the command line to explore the problem in more depth .
The line of JavaScript we ’re looking at does the following three things :
It gets a reference to the status bar element .
In the DOM inspector view , you will see that the corresponding markup is < p class= “ statusbar ” > .
It looks up its firstChild , in other words , the first node inside this paragraph element .
It sets the innerText property .
Let ’s try to run a bit more of that command from the command line .
( Tip : use the up arrow key to navigate back to previous lines typed into the command line field . )
For example , you might wonder what the current value of this element ’s innerText property is before it is set .
To check this , you can type the entire command up to the equals sign into the command line :
getElements ( ‘ p ’ , {'class ':' statusbar'} ) [ 0].firstChild.innerText
Surprisingly , the output is …nothing .
So the expression getElements ( ‘ p ’ , {'class ' :' statusbar'} ) [ 0 ] .
firstChild points to something in the DOM that does not contain any text , or does not have an innerText property .
So , the next question is : what exactly is the first child node of the paragraph element ?
Let ’s ask the command line that question .
( See figure four for the result . )
fig .
4 : the Dragonfly debugger command line , outputting [ object Text ] .
Dragonfly ’s [ object Text ] output shows that this is a DOM text node .
Firebug shows us the content of the text node as a link to the DOM explorer .
You have now found the problem that causes bug number one : a text node does not have an innerText property — only element nodes do .
Hence , setting p.firstChild.innerText does nothing .
This bug can be fixed by replacing innerText with nodeValue , which is a property the W3C DOM standard defines on text nodes .
After you ’ve had a chance to review this example :
Press [ F5 ] or the run button to finish the script , now that you ’ve found the problem .
Remember to clear the old breakpoint by clicking the line number again .
Bug two : problematic language detection #section9
You may have noticed the var lang ; /* language */ line near the top of the JavaScript — the code that sets this variable is probably involved when things go wrong .
You can find things in the code quickly using the handy search functions provided by both debuggers .
In Dragonfly it ’s just above the code viewer ; in Firebug it ’s on the top right side of the Firebug user interface .
( See figure five . )
To find the place that deals with the application ’s localization :
Type lang = into the search field .
Set a breakpoint on the line where the lang variable is assigned a value .
Reload the page .
Safari ’s WebInspector also has a very powerful search feature .
WebInspector allows you to search all the code at the same time , including markup , CSS , and JavaScript .
The results are shown in a dedicated pane where you can doubleclick them to jump to the source line , as shown in the screenshot .
fig . 5 : searching with the Dragonfly and WebInspector debuggers .
To inspect what this function does :
Use the “ step into ” button to enter the getLanguage function .
Click the “ step into ” button repeatedly to go through the code one line at a time .
Keep an eye on the overview of local variables to see how they change while you step through the function .
Stepping into the getLanguage function , you will see that it tries reading the language from the user - agent string .
The author of this code noticed that some language information is included in the user - agent string on some browsers , and tries to parse navigator .
userAgent to extract this information :
var str1 = navigator.userAgent.match ( /((.* ) ) / ) [ 1 ] ; var ar1 = str1.split(/s*;s*/) , lang ; for ( var i = 0 ; i < ar1.length ; i++) { if ( ar1 < i>.match ( / ^(.{ 2} ) $/ ) ) { lang = ar1 < i > ; } }
While stepping through this code with the debuggers , you can use the local variables overview .
Figure six shows Firebug and IE8 Developer Tools with the ar1 array expanded to show the elements in it :
fig .
6 : Firebug and IE8 ’s local variable panes , while running the getLanguage function .
The ar1 < i>.match (/^(.{2} ) $/ ) statements simply look for a string that is exactly two characters long , expecting a two - character language code such as en or no .
However , as you can see from the screenshots , Firefox ’s language information in the user - agent string is actually nn-NO .
IE has no language - related information in this part of the userAgent string .
The second bug has been found : the language detection looks for a two - letter language code , but Firefox has a five letter locale string and IE has nothing .
This “ language detection ” code should probably be scrapped altogether , and replaced with something server - side that uses the HTTP Accept - Language header or possibly falls back to reading navigator .
language .
Or navigator.userLanguage in IE .
One example of what that function might look like is shown below :
function getLanguage ( ) { var lang ; if ( navigator.language ) { lang = navigator .
language ; } else if ( navigator.userLanguage ) { lang = navigator.userLanguage ; } if ( lang && lang .
length >
2 ) { lang = lang .
substring (0 , 2 ) ; } return lang ; }
Bug three : the mystery prop variable # section10
fig .
7 : Firebug and Dragonfly ’s local variable panes showing the global prop variable .
In figure seven , you can clearly see the mystery prop variable .
Well - written applications keep the number of global variables to a minimum , because they can cause confusion when different sections of the application try to use the same variable name .
Imagine that tomorrow , another team of developers added a new feature to our application and also named a variable prop .
We ’d have two different parts of our application trying to use the same variable name for different things .
This practice is a recipe for conflicts and bugs down the road .
Hence , you have to track down where this variable is set and see if there is a way to make it a local variable .
You could start searching like we did to find bug two above , but perhaps there is a smarter way …
Debuggers for many other programming languages have a “ watch ” concept that can break into the debugger when a variable changes .
Neither Dragonfly nor Firebug currently support “ watch ” but it ’s easy to get the same effect by adding the following line of debugging code at the top of the source of the script you ’re troubleshooting :
__defineSetter__( ‘ prop ’ , function ( ) { debugger ; } ) ;
To add this “ watch ” - like functionality to the debugged script :
Add the debugging code to the top of the first script .
Reload the page .
Note how it breaks when the problem occurs .
Using getters and setters can emulate “ watch ” functionality and help you set “ smart ” breakpoints .
The IE8 Developer Tools have a “ watch ” pane , but it does n’t break when a watched variable is modified .
Given IE8 ’s incomplete support for getters and setters , you ca n’t emulate this functionality the way you can in Firefox , Opera , and Safari .
When you reload the application , it will immediately break where the global variable prop is being defined .
It actually stops at the line of debugging code you added because this is where the debugger statement is .
One click on the “ step out ” button will take you from the setter function to the place where the variable is set .
This code is found inside the getElements function : ( Line wraps marked » — Ed. )
for ( prop in attributes ) { if ( el.getAttribute ( prop ) != attributes [ prop ] ) includeThisElement » = false ;
It now stops just below the line that starts with for ( prop .
Here , you can see that the prop variable is used without being defined as a local variable , with a var keyword inside the function .
Simply changing it to for ( var prop will fix our third bug .
Bug four : the clone attribute that should n’t be there # section11
The fourth bug was obviously found by a thorough tester using a DOM inspector , because it ’s not visible from the user interface of the application .
But , as soon as you open the DOM inspectors ( in Firebug it ’s the “ HTML ” tab , while in Dragonfly the feature is called “ DOM ” ) it becomes clear that many elements have clone attributes with JavaScript source code in them that should n’t be there :
fig .
8 : Dragonfly ’s DOM inspector shows the problematic code .
Every element created by the script has a superfluous clone attribute .
Since it ’s something the end user will never notice from the user interface , it may not appear to be a serious bug .
But imagine the performance impact if this script is used to create a DOM tree with hundreds or thousands of elements …
The fastest way to find this problem is to set a breakpoint that only occurs when an attribute named clone is set on any HTML element .
Can our debuggers handle that ?
JavaScript is a very flexible language , and one of its strengths ( or quirks , depending on your point of view ) is that you can replace core functions with your own .
Add this snippet of debugging code to the page , and it will replace the original setAttribute ( ) method with one that breaks if a clone attribute is set :
var funcSetAttr = Element.prototype.setAttribute ; /* keep a pointer to the original function */ Element.prototype.setAttribute = function ( name , value ) { if ( name == ' clone ' ) { debugger ; /* break if script sets the ' clone ' attribute */ } funcSetAttr.call ( this , name , value ) ; /* call original function to ensure those other attributes are set correctly */ } ;
To find the clone attribute creation point :
Add the debugging code at the top of the first script in the document .
Reload the page .
As soon as you reload the page , the script starts generating the DOM , but breaks the first time it attempts to set the bad attribute .
( Note that in current versions of Firefox , setAttribute has various element - specific implementations .
The code above only works as expected in Opera ; to get the same effect in Firefox you can replace the word Element with HTMLFormElement to replace the more specific HTMLFormElement.prototype.setAttribute method . )
When execution stops at the breakpoint , you ’ll want to know where the setAttribute ( ) call occurred .
This means you have to go back up the list of called functions and figure out how the script got here .
For this , you ’ll use the call stack .
Figure nine shows Dragonfly ’s and IE8 ’s call stacks when stopped at the breakpoint .
Just for reference , I ’ve created a manual breakpoint in IE8 at roughly the same place the setAttribute ( ) technique stops .
You can see that in Dragonfly the most recently called function is at the top — it ’s the anonymous function that was mapped to setAttribute .
It was called from makeElement at line 95 :
fig .
9 : Dragonfly and IE8 ’s call stacks .
Figure 10 shows Firebug ’s call stack view .
The setAttribute < makeElement < init line next to the file name is the stack — and you can see that the most recently called function is the leftmost one :
fig .
10 : The version of Firebug we used shows the callstack on one line .
The last function called is on the left .
By clicking earlier functions in the stack list you can step back through the calls and look at how you arrived here .
It ’s important to try this yourself to fully understand how powerful this feature is .
Note that when you jump to another stack entry , the local variable pane is updated to show you the current state of the variables in the calling function .
How to use the call stack to find the offending function :
Click the function you want to see in the call stack .
Note that the local variables pane updates to show the variables local to that function .
Remember that if you use the step buttons , they will take you onwards from the last call even if you are inspecting other parts of the stack .
Clicking the makeElement reference takes us back to this part :
for ( var prop in attributes ) { el.setAttribute( prop , attributes [ prop ] ) ; }
where you see the setAttribute call .
The local variables / frame inspection panes show that the value of prop is indeed clone .
The variable prop is defined in the for …in loop .
This tells us that one of the properties of the attributes object must be named clone .
The attributes variable is defined as the second named argument of that function .
If you go one step up to the init part of the stack , you can see that the previous function call was this :
var form = makeElement ( ‘ form ’ , { action :’/ login ’ , method : ’ post ’ , name : ’loginform ’ } , document . body ) ;
The second argument to the method is highlighted in bold — this object does not have a clone property .
So where does it come from ?
If you click the makeElement function in the stack again , you can inspect the attributes variable .
In Firebug you ’ll see the clone property appear .
You can click the function it references to jump to the definition — note the line highlighted in blue in Figure 11 :
fig .
11 : Firebug shows us where the clone property was defined .
The Dragonfly alpha does not include properties of an object ’s prototype in the variable inspection view , so clone does not appear there .
But now you ’ve learned that a clone function exists on all objects .
If you enable the “ stop at new script ” setting , and create a new thread calling this method , you ’ll jump right to it .
To find the clone definition in Dragonfly :
Toggle the “ stop at new script ” option with the user interface button shown in this screenshot :
Paste the following code into the address bar of the window you are debugging :
javascript:void( {}.clone ( ) ) ;
With a bookmarklet , you can start new threads in the debugged document at will .
For example , you could try javascript: void( {}.clone ( ) ) ; to start a new thread that will call the clone ( ) method .
When Dragonfly stops at the new thread , one click on the “ step into ” button jumps to the problematic definition of the clone property .
( Note that a Dragonfly bug may require disabling User JavaScript to get this working . )
And here ’s the cause of the fourth bug : a clone method is added to all objects using Object .
prototype syntax .
This is considered a bad practice , because using for …in on objects will see everything you add to Object .
prototype .
This may create bugs that are very hard to track down .
To fix this bug , you could move the clone method so that it is defined directly on the Object object instead of on the prototype , and then fix any calls to obj.clone ( ) so that they become Object. clone ( obj ) instead .
For example , avoid this :
// BAD , do n't do this : Object.prototype.clone = function ( ) { var obj = {} ; for ( var prop in this ) { obj [ prop ] = this [ prop ] ; } return obj ; }// some code that demonstrates using the clone ( ) method : var my Obj1 = { ' id ' : ' 1 ' } ; var myObj2 = myObj1.clone ( ) ;
Do this instead :
Object.clone = function ( originalObject ) { var obj = {} ; for ( var prop in original Object ) { obj[ prop ] = originalObject [ prop ] ; } return obj ; }// some code that demonstrates using the clone ( ) method : var my Obj1 = { ' id ' : ' 1 ' } ; var myObj2 = Object.clone(myObj1 ) ;
The latter example avoids modifying Object .
prototype and thus works better with other scripts using for …in type loops .

Fortune is working on a solo album , Death of a Motivational Speaker
The singer who won a reality TV competition to front Australian rockers INXS says he is broke and living in his car after the band sacked him .
JD Fortune has told Canada 's Entertainment Tonight that he was dismissed with a handshake and a thank you after a world tour .
The singer also admitted he began using cocaine during his time with the band .
INXS , currently on a break , have not commented on Fortune 's claims but their website still lists him as singer .
The band had a string of hits in the 1980s and 1990s including New Sensation and Need You Tonight but in 1997 charismatic frontman Michael Hutchence was found dead .
Four different singers have since been in the band 's line - up and Rock Star : INXS was their latest attempt to find a permanent front man .
" Really alone " Canadian Fortune beat ten other finalists to the role .
They recorded just one album , Switch , in 2005 and followed the release with a two year world tour .
He said he was hurt by the band 's decision to let him go : " I found myself really alone because I had travelled with these guys for 23 months . "
Fortune says he has been off drugs for two years and is living in the back of his pickup after putting his remaining INXS earnings into funding his new solo album .

The trial of an Iraqi man who threw his shoes at former US President George W Bush has been adjourned until March .
Muntadar al - Zaidi is charged with assaulting a foreign leader and faces a maximum sentence of 15 years .
His lawyers argue he was simply expressing his views in a country where passions are still inflamed after the US - led invasion in 2003 .
In his first public appearance since his arrest , Mr Zaidi was met in court by applause , ululating and chanting .
The journalist wore an Iraqi flag draped over his shoulders .
He appeared fit and well , despite reports from friends and family that he was badly beaten shortly after his arrest .
But a BBC reporter who saw Mr Zaidi at close quarters said his right front tooth was missing .
The Iraqi TV reporter achieved global notoriety by his actions , which were celebrated across the Arab world .
' Symbol of disrespect '
In court in Baghdad , Mr Zaidi requested two more lawyers to be added to his already huge defence team , and the judge ordered a short break to consider the request .
The judge later adjourned the trial until 12 March , saying the court needs time to ask the Iraqi cabinet whether Mr Bush 's visit was " formal or informal " , the Associated Press news agency reported .
The point could be significant .
The Iraqi penal code specifies a prison sentence of between seven to 15 years for attacking a foreign head of state during an official visit .
If the charges were reduced to " insulting " a foreign head of state , the penalty could come down to two years in jail or a fine .
Earlier , the head of his defence team told the BBC they would be pressing for the charges to be dismissed and for Mr Zaidi to be freed , without delay .
He said Mr Zaidi stood by what he had done and would not be offering any apologies to Mr Bush .
Mr Zaidi's lawyers say he was making a legitimate protest Mr Zaidi 's lawyers said earlier that he had simply been expressing his opposition to the US presence in Iraq and that Mr Bush had never been in serious danger .
" Have you ever heard of anyone being killed by a shoe ? " lawyer Dhiaa al - Saadi asked Reuters news agency in December .
" In Europe , they throw eggs and rotten tomatoes to insult .
In Iraq , throwing a shoe is a symbol of disrespect . "
The trial is not expected to last long , as the sequence of events is not in dispute .
Mr Zaidi threw two shoes at Mr Bush during a press conference in Baghdad on 15 December .
He shouted that Mr Bush was " a dog " and the shoes were " a farewell kiss " from those who had been killed , orphaned or widowed in Iraq .
Mr Bush ducked the shoes and appeared untroubled by the incident , joking shortly after that he knew they were a size 10 .
Mr Zaidi was arrested and has been held in custody ever since .
His actions were condemned by the Iraqi government as " shameful " , but he was celebrated as a hero by thousands in the Arab world , who called for his immediate release from prison .
Mr Zaidi had been due to go on trial last December , but his trial was postponed .
One of his brothers , Dargham al - Zaidi , told the BBC he believed the Iraqi authorities were damaging themselves by prolonging the shoe - thrower 's detention .
" The longer they keep him in jail , the more they add to his glory and make a hero of him .
Now people are copying him in other countries , " he said .

She should think about spending some time in the sun , the study suggests Children who are born in late summer or early autumn are often taller and stronger than peers born in spring and winter , a large study suggests .
The results from the Children of the 90s project - which involved 7,000 youngsters - says the reason may lie in their mothers ' exposure to the sun .
The body makes Vitamin D , crucial for bone - building , from sunlight .
The Bristol University study suggests that this process may even occur in babies while still in the womb .
By the age of 10 , those children born in the summer and autumn months were on average half a centimetre taller and had nearly 13 cm sq of extra bone area than those born in the winter months .
Wider bones are thought to be stronger and less prone to breaking as a result of osteoporosis in later life , so anything that affects early bone development is significant
Professor Jon Tobias
Bristol University " Wider bones are thought to be stronger and less prone to breaking as a result of osteoporosis in later life , so anything that affects early bone development is significant , " said Professor Jon Tobias , one of the researchers .
Mothers entering the late stages of pregnancy in the summer can attain the necessary vitamin D levels by walking around outside or even sunbathing , the researchers suggested .
People should not panic about skin cancer as a result of controlled exposure , as some sun was much better than none , they added .
And if there was not much sun to be seen , " women might consider talking to their doctor about taking Vitamin D supplements , particularly if their babies are due between November and May , " said Professor Tobias .
In winter months at latitudes of 52 degrees north ( above Birmingham ) , there is no ultraviolet light of the appropriate wavelength for the body to make vitamin D in the skin , research shows .
The Arthritis Research Campaign is currently running a trial to establish whether giving vitamin D to pregnant women increases the bone density of their babies at birth and in childhood and reduces the risk of developing osteoporosis in later life .
" Although most people in the UK can can get the essential nutrients they need from their diet , and do n't need to take extra supplements , the exception is vitamin D , " a spokeswoman for the charity said .
" Because of a lack of sunshine in the UK in winter many Brits are vitamin D deficient , with vitamin D deficiency extremely common in pregnant women , leading to their babies having weaker bones at birth . "
A study last year also suggested that pregnant and nursing mothers take supplements to curtail an apparent resurgence of the bone disease rickets .

February 26 , 2009
For 2 months , Walid Abu Arjela and his family haven�t dared to return to their land in Am Almad of Khoza�a village , east of Khan Younis , in the lethal Israeli - imposed " buffer zone " .
The land in question , 550 m from the Green Line border , used to be productive agricultural land , as with most of the land now confiscated by the Israeli military occupation of Gaza and the imposition of a " no - go zone " on the Palestinian side of the Green Line .
And as with the fertile land of the " buffer zone " from south to north , the land was heavily worked and produced vegetables , grains and fruits for much of the Gaza Strip�s residents and even , before the siege , for export .
On Tuesday , 24 February , Abu Arjela and family hoped to harvest peas and pick the scrubby weeds that donkeys can eat , regular animal feed being on the list of items no longer available in Gaza as a result of the comprehensive , debilitating Israeli , Egyptian and international siege on Gaza .
In other areas of the region east of Khan Younis , farmers tend to employ local youths to work the land , but whereas the Am Almad farmers are a couple hundred metres closer to the border fence from which Israeli soldier shooting comes , they are no longer confident that they can safely practice daily productive farming .
The farmers that do dare to return to their land tend to be elderly , small groups of family members .
Such was the case with the Abu Arjelas .
" We haven�t been back to this land for about 2 months , " Mohammed Suleiman Abu Arjela , Walid�s father , explained .
Indeed , at the end of November , 2008 , he�d stood by his cowshed hoping to work the land that day , explaining that his farm had been twice devastated [ First , in September 2006 , when Israeli forces entered with bulldozers , destroying 5 dunums ( 1 dunum= 1000 square metres ) of 15 year old olive trees , 2 dunums of orange and lemon trees , the kitchen and the bathroom of his home , the cow shed , with 7 cows inside , and 200 turkeys and 100 bred pigeons in the process .
And then in summer 2008 , Israeli soldiers returned , killing 15 sheep , destroying 10 tons of animal feed , and filling in the cistern with rubble , destroying the water source . ] .
The bulldozers which entered near his land that November day prevented he and the handful of other farmers from plowing the land , instead leaving as quickly as their donkeys and tractor would allow .
Small numbers of farmers also dared to go on their land Tuesday , hoping that this might be a day they could safely farm and gather animal fodder .
And like the Abu Arjelas , they were mostly elderly men and women and their sons , spread out over a large area .
Roughly five minutes after the Abu Arjelas had reached their land , Israeli forces amassed at the border fence began firing .
Four army jeeps and a Hummer stood at the fence .
The shots could in no have been considered ' warning � shots : they rang clearly past our ears , hit the dirt less than a metre away .
They were sniper - style shots .
Immediately , the international accompaniment began to speak through a megaphone , reiterating the peaceful , non-armed nature of all gathered in the fields .
The firing was the most intense in recent weeks , closer than it�s been in New Abassan , which even then was already within metres of heads and feet .
We could almost taste Tuesday�s firing , and the distinct ping - whizz sound they make was somehow impossibly loud , so close the shots were .
One of the older women was having trouble walking away , stumbling in her fear .
As the shots dug in around her she fell to the ground in terror .
Positioning ourselves between the elderly farmers and the Israeli snipers , we thus accompanied them off the field , many suddenly crouching instinctively when the shots came near .
A few hundred metres away , the Israeli snipers continued to shoot .
Another elderly woman had dived in terror behind a rock and adamantly wouldn�t get up .
" They�ll kill me , they�ll kill me .
Mother� , " she cried in fear .
Gradually , surrounding her we were able to lead her away , she all the while fearfully muttering incoherently .
Down the dirt lane , donkey carts only partially - filled with greens for animal food , the terrorized farmers converged in bewilderment .
Most had had enough and were giving up , as the Israeli military plan hopes they will .
The plan is transparent enough , and what I�ve seen in my nearly 4 months here is the policy of terrorizing the farmers and residents living near the Green Line into abandoning their homes , their land .
There are a number who defy this institutionalized terrorizing , who will work the land until they die , naturally or at the hands of the well - equipped Israeli army .
And many are giving up , saying enough , choosing safety over livelihoods although the choice is impossible to make .
For many of the people living and working in the " buffer zone " the produce they squeeze from the land , and the revenue from the chicken farms that are becoming less numerous with each invasion and attack , is their means of existence .
But in Khoza�a , Mohammed Abu Arjela is n�t ready to give in , despite the odds stacked against his life .
" I have two children .
I must go back to my fields to work there today .
This is our life , what can we do ? "
As we stood gazing back to the abandoned farmland , a crop - duster gracefully swooped again to treat crops on the other side of the Green Line .
It rose and swooped , the small airplane unhurriedly gliding over nurtured crops which months later will be unhurriedly harvested .
Life is not so impossible outside of Gaza .
The gaming groundhog sticks his head from his hole , goes to Blockbuster and sees : F.E.A.R. 2 : Project Origin ( 360 ) .
Most people associate F.E.A.R. with Alma , the creepy little girl who gets bloody footprints everywhere and sets shit on fire .
But F.E.A.R. is really about one thing : slow motion head - shot porn .
I probably wo n’t cover this quickly approaching game , but if I did , the article would probably go something like :

Did it always have huge gun-toting robots and super mutants ?
Ah , finally !
Some real information .
I was born in a vault underground !
No one ever enters , and no one ever leaves !
Holy cow , my blood is all over the screen and I ’m a crying baby !
A doctor asks if I ’m a boy or a girl while looking at my privates .
Jesus , how embarrassing .
You ’re supposed to be the doctor , asshole .
“ Welcome to escapist fantasy , where your penis is so small , it might qualify as a vagina ! ”
At least now I know why I want to destroy this world .
Anyway , the game asks me to pick a gender , so I choose “ Male ” .
Liam Neeson is telling a lady that he has a son .
Holy shit , Liam Neeson is my dad .
He says he and my mother have been discussing names , and what do I think of “ Blank ” .
Ooh , I get to fill it in !
I can be whoever I want .
I need to compensate for this whole penis issue , so I ’ll be Pole Johnson .
Next I can choose my race and alter my face .
I make myself African American , which should give me at least a +12 to penis size .
But now my name is n’t right .
I back out , add a “ De ” , and “ DePole Johnson ” is born .
Perfect !
My mom says I look “ strapping . ”
That ’s more like it !
Everyone is looking at me with pride .
My mom is so impressed , she has a heart attack and dies .
Now I ’m in a nursery , and a black man is telling me to walk to him with Liam Neeson ’s voice .
Wow , Neeson has the whitest voice ever .
“ I know you do n’t like it when daddy leaves you alone , but you need to take care of yourself for awhile . ”
At least he walks the walk .
President Obama abruptly changed tactics Wednesday in his bid to revive the economy , setting aside his bipartisan stance and pointedly blaming Republicans for demanding what he cast as discredited “ piecemeal measures . ”
Obama ’s comments were a marked departure from the conciliatory tone he has maintained as he courted Republican votes for his stimulus package through compromise .
Against the wishes of his own party , Obama crafted a plan that relied heavily on tax cuts rooted in Republican economic doctrine .
But in an unusual opinion piece in today ’s Washington Post , and in remarks he made at two White House appearances , the president seemed to acknowledge that his approach was n’t working .
The shift in message comes amid signs of trouble for Obama ’s $ 800 - billion - plus stimulus bill .
Not a single Republican voted for the measure last week in the House , and even some moderate Democrats in the Senate have expressed discomfort over the escalating cost .

Moderates from both parties have complained about spending projects , such as smoking - cessation programs , that do n’t seem geared to giving the economy a jolt .
While signing a children ’s health insurance bill in the East Room of the White House , Obama referred to the results of the November election .
It was a reminder to Republicans -- and perhaps even some wayward Democrats -- that Obama won solidly and still enjoys a high approval rating .
“ Now , let me say this , ” Obama said .
“ In the past few days , I ’ve heard criticisms of this plan that frankly echo the very same failed theories that helped lead us into this crisis in the first place -- the notion that tax cuts alone will solve all our problems , that we can address this enormous crisis with half steps and piecemeal measures and tinkering around the edges , that we can ignore fundamental challenges , like the high cost of healthcare , and still expect our economy and our country to thrive .
“ I reject these theories , ” he continued .
“ And , by the way , so did the American people when they went to the polls in November and voted resoundingly for change . ”

Obama also sought to sway public opinion in his favor through his newspaper column , reiterating many of the same points .
“ In recent days , there have been misguided criticisms of this plan that echo the failed theories that helped lead us into this crisis -- the notion that tax cuts alone will solve all our problems , ” Obama wrote .
That was a clear jab at Republicans , who have an alternative proposal to jump - start the economy that depends primarily on tax cuts .
Obama ’s partisan turn entails a calculated risk .
He can not afford to see the stimulus bill fail .
Without it , he warns , an already painful recession will worsen .
With the stimulus in place , he says , the nation will create or save up to 4 million jobs .

Briefing reporters on Wednesday , White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs did not rebut suggestions that Obama was opting for a more combative tone .
By failing to take dramatic action , “ we ’ll find ourselves worse off than where we are now , ” Gibbs said .
“ We have to take those bold steps . ”
As he publicly ratchets up pressure on the opposition , Obama is doing some private arm - twisting .
He met Wednesday with two Senate Republicans and a Democrat considered to be key moderates : Sens. Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins , both Maine Republicans , and Sen. Ben Nelson , a Nebraska Democrat .
The three are part of a group of senators seeking to “ scrub ” the bill to remove programs that are not likely to give the economy an immediate boost .

Snowe , who spoke with reporters afterward , said there may be $ 100 billion in programs that would have to be removed before some of the moderates could support the measure .
Obama was “ very amenable ” to her suggestions , she said .
Politically , the stimulus is the first major test of Obama ’s presidency .
The bill is likely to pass because of the overwhelming Democratic congressional majority .
A defeat , however , would end a political honeymoon that already may be foreshortened because of the dust - up over a trio of Cabinet nominees with tax problems .
But if Obama wins by eschewing the bipartisanship he preached throughout his nearly two - year campaign , he could jeopardize prospects for a healthcare overhaul , energy transformation and other projects he is planning .
For the moment , Democrats are looking to recapture momentum .
In the Senate , Republicans have been mounting a drive to replace the bill ’s spending programs with tax provisions .
On Wednesday , the Senate approved a GOP - backed amendment for a tax credit of up to $ 15,000 for home buyers .

The credit doubles the tax break under existing law , which applies only to primary residences -- not to second homes .
Proposed by Sen. Johnny Isakson ( R - Ga. ) , the credit is expected to cost about $ 19 billion .
As the Senate debate continued , Democrats parried GOP efforts to cut spending in favor of more tax breaks .
“ American public opinion is seeing this for what it is : a spending bill , not a stimulus bill , and I think it ’s swinging in our direction , ” Sen. John McCain ( R - Ariz . ) told Fox News .
Obama wants the Senate to vote before opposition hardens .
At one time , proponents of the bill had hoped it would be passed and ready for him to sign when he was sworn in Jan. 20 .
Now , Obama hopes Congress completes action before a recess at the end of next week .
Advertisement
In virtually every public appearance , Obama tries to convey a sense of urgency .
“ A failure to act , and act now , will turn crisis into a catastrophe and guarantee a longer recession , a less robust recovery and a more uncertain future , ” he warned at another White House appearance .

This year will be crucial for the new format .
Heavy holiday discounting and the natural decline in electronics prices over time have pushed prices for some Blu-ray players under $ 200 , a drop of well more than half in the last few years  and into the realm of affordability for many .
At the same time , Blu-ray ’s backers , including Sony and the Walt Disney Company , face a growing chorus of skeptics that says the window for a high - definition disc format may be closing fast .
One reason is that discs of all kinds may become obsolete as a new wave of digital media services starts to flow into the living room .
On Monday , for example , the Korean television maker LG Electronics plans to announce a new line of high - definition televisions that connect directly to the Internet with no set - top box required .
The televisions will be able to play movies and television shows from online video - on - demand services , including Netflix .
“ The Blu-ray format is in jeopardy simply because the advent of downloadable HD movies is so close , ” said Roger L. Kay , president of Endpoint Technologies Associates .
a research and consulting company .
“ Streaming video from the Internet and other means of direct digital delivery are going to put optical formats out of business entirely over the next few years . ”
Blu -ray ’s supporters have another view .
They say the technology had a breakout year , crowned by the holiday success of “ The Dark Knight , ” which sold 600,000 Blu-ray copies in one day .
They also say that Blu-ray players are selling faster than DVD players did at a comparable time in their emergence .
“ What we saw in 2008 was increasing adoption of Blu-ray along with decreasing hardware prices , ” said Reed Hastings , the chief executive of Netflix , which has persuaded more than half a million members to pay an extra dollar a month to rent Blu-ray discs .
“ The window of opportunity for DVD and Blu-ray discs is longer than most people think .
But it ’s not going to last forever . ”
Embedded Linux developer Jaya Kumar has successfully tested Mozilla 's Fennec browser on an E - Ink screen .
He published several videos on YouTube this week that demonstrate how the open source browser performs on a low - energy monochrome electronic paper display ( EPD ) .
He used the Broadsheet AM300 kit , which includes an interactive EPD and a Linux - based Gumstix mobile development board with an XScale processor , a memory card reader , built - in Bluetooth support , and USB ports .
Kumar is doing some nifty Broadsheet driver hacking and has published several impressive demonstrations based on his work with the kit .
Kumar 's latest tests feature Fennec , Mozilla 's mobile Firefox browser .
In the videos , he interacts with Fennec 's user interface elements and loads several web pages .
The browser is surprisingly responsive on the Broadsheet device .
Although he's off to a very good start , there are still some limitations .
He has n't gotten an on - screen keyboard to work yet and Fennec 's memory requirements are a bit too much for the Gumstix board .
He plans to adopt the on - screen keyboard from Hildon , which comes from the Maemo platform on Nokia 's Internet Tablet products .
Video created by Jaya Kumar
The Fennec project is moving along swiftly and is becoming increasingly viable on resource - constrained devices .
The first Fennec alpha release delivered an intriguing finger - friendly user interface with URL autocompletion and tabbed browsing .
The second alpha , which was released last month , included some excellent optimizations and performance improvements .
We are starting to see a huge amount of potential in the Fennec project , particularly in the area of extensibility .
As we noted in our review of the second alpha release , third - party developers are already building Fennec add - ons that expand the browser 's functionality in various ways and a port of Mozilla Weave is in progress .
The Fennec developers are also expanding the browser 's reach to new platforms .
The primary development target is Nokia 's N810 Internet Tablet , but there is also a prototype for Windows Mobile and a Symbian port under heavy development that is expected to arrive in April .
According to the Fennec roadmap , the mobile browser 's first mobile release will take place next month .
This is a source of much excitement in the Mozilla developer community .
The mobile browsing space is fiercely competitive , and it's an area where Mozilla has not traditionally had a strong presence .
Fennec could change that and bring Mozilla 's browsing technology to a whole new audience .
Kumar 's test of Fennec on an EPD is intriguing because it demonstrates the potential for bringing a richer desktop - like browsing experience to low - power e-book devices such as the Amazon Kindle .
If you wish to succeed in life , make perseverance your bosom friend , experience your wise counselor , caution your elder brother , and hope your guardian genius .

Looking at my life , there are many life lessons I ’ve learned .
Some of them are the fruits of difficult experiences .
Some others are the advice I got from wise people .
They came from different sources but they all have something in common : they are all useful to guide my life into the future .
Here I ’d like to share with you eight life lessons that have significantly affected my life .
Apply them and you will achieve true success in life .
Here they are :
1 . Be grateful
Being grateful is perhaps the most important attitude you must have to live a happy life .
No matter how bad the situations around you are , you can always choose to respond positively .
Being grateful makes you look at the world through positive lens and energizes your life .
Do n’t take things for granted .
Be grateful even for simple things .
2. Follow your heart
Nothing can replace following your heart .
People may tell you about the right thing to do or what they expect from you , but at the end , it ’s your life .
If you do n’t live your own life , who will ?
So slow down and listen to your heart .
What does it tell you about your career ?
What does it tell you about your relationships ?
Listen to your heart and find the courage to follow it .
3. Dream big
How far you go is very much determined by how big your dream is .
Having a small dream is like putting yourself inside a small box .
You might end up living far below your fullest potential .
Of course , it ’s not easy to dream big .
Perhaps your failures in the past scare you .
Perhaps you do n’t think you have what it takes to achieve your dream .
But do n’t let negativity push you down .
Be dare to dream big .
If you can dream it , you can do it .
Always remember that this whole thing was started with a dream and a mouse .
Walt Disney
4 . Good is the worst enemy of best
When you reach a position that is good enough , you may become comfortable and think that it ’s no longer worth it to continue fighting for the best .
That ’s why good is the worst enemy of best : it makes you stop before you achieve your fullest potential .
It distracts you from pursuing your best life .
Be grateful for what you have but understand that you still have a lot more in front of you .
5 . Run your own race
Your race is different from other people ’s races .
Realizing this is liberating because it frees you from envy .
When you hear that other people are successful , you can sincerely be grateful since you are not in competition with them .
At the same time , it also pushes you to live your best life .
Why ?
Because you are competing against yourself .
I do not try to dance better than anyone else .
I only try to dance better than myself .
Mikhail Baryshnikov
6. Focus on what you can control
Sometimes you might have bad experiences that you ca n’t do anything about .
If that happened , do n’t dwell on it .
You are wasting a lot of mental energy if you do .
Move on and focus instead on things you can control .
Applying this frees you from a lot of stress and worries .
One application of this principle is on changing people .
Which one do you think you can change : yourself or other people ?
You ca n’t change other people but you can change yourself .
So focus on changing yourself .
7. Failure is your friend
Befriending failure makes you dare to try new things .
It puts you on the path of inventions , breakthroughs , and innovations .
Failure is often the price of progress .
Would you like me to give you a formula for success ?
It ’s quite simple , really .
Double your rate of failure .
Thomas J. Watson
8. Relationships are your greatest treasures
At the end , what do you want to achieve in life ?
Will it be meaningful to have a lot of money if you have broken relationships ?
Will it be meaningful to be famous if you lose love ?
I do n’t think so .
Your relationships are your greatest treasures .
Understand it before it ’s too late .
Bugs of Doom ( aka the Heisenbugs ) Posted by Louis Brandy on 16 February 2009
I think anyone who has programmed for any length of time has some stories to tell about the most ridiculous and convoluted bugs that they 've ever encountered .
Here 's my little hall of fame .
Pretty much all of the most convoluted bugs have something in common : they are incredibly difficult to reproduce .
In low level languages , this typically involves one of three issues : memory management , concurrency , or rarely a bug in something you should be trusting ( your compiler , your OS , etc. ) .
In higher level languages , the most convoluted bugs tend to happen when the auto - magic of your language hits some corner case and goes haywire .
The absolute worst of the worst are the heisenbugs .
That is , the bugs that only happen when you are n't looking for them .
The harder you try to find them , the less reproducible they become .**
The very act of trying to debug them , makes them disappear .**
Concurrency troubles
We created a live demonstration of our face detection and face tracking .
We decided to stress test it and leave it running for awhile .
It would dead lock after running for about 2 days .
How we attacked it :
It was relatively simple to determine that a thread was crashing .
The problem was altering the code in any meaningful way ended up making the bug irreproducible .
You can imagine the pain in testing this , however , because it takes a good 4 to 5 days to decide the bug is n't going to happen , and even then you are n't sure .
What caused it :
It ended up , no surprise , being a subtle race condition .
We set up a thread - safe queue to have the mother process dump all the work to be done onto , and then had the worker threads reading off that queue .
In our implementation , the queue could be connected to by worker threads , it would give them things to do , and be disconnected from once the worker thread was done .
It would also clean itself up once all the connections died and there was nothing left on the queue .
Well , that last little bit is the root of the problem : the program crashed in the pathological condition when one of the threads was blocked in such a way that the other threads were all able to connect to the queue , process all of the data , and then disconnect .
The queue would clean itself up , then , and the final thread would awake and try to connect to the now vanished queue .
Crash .
The fallout :
It probably took us an off - and - on three weeks to figure this one out .
Most of that time was spent reproducing the original crash before we started looking seriously .
Threading is no joke .
Even simple implementations are wrought with potential problems .
From that point on , we made some ( obvious ) rules regarding our threading constructions .
First , we have a " prove this is too slow , first " approach to extra complexity ( is there an off the shelf solution ?
Does an extremely simple solution work , first ? ) .
Next , if you really need a customized synchronization method for performance reasons , you make it generic ( so it can be reused ) and you test it with extreme predjudice .
We 've built up a nice library of extremely well - tested thread - safe data structures for our use cases .
We rarely have to write new ones , these days .
Memory , memory , memory
Again we decide to stress test an application and it seg - faulted after a few days .
How we attacked it :
We turned off threading , and it ran for 2 weeks , no problems .
We removed the assembly code ( replacing it with our non-assembly versions ) and it ran for 2 weeks , no problems .
Sigh .
Okay , now what ?
Was the assembly code bugged and trouncing out of bounds overwriting important information ?
Another race condition ?
Or some memory issues that only showed up in certain circumstances ?
It was the last one .
What caused it : I did .
In order to maximize speed for SIMD assembly , you want your data structures to be aligned to cache - line boundaries .
This typically means you want all of your primary data structures to start on addresses mod 16 = 0 .
In order to do this , I had created an aligned allocator .
The assembly code was using the aligned allocator , while the non-assembly code defaulted to the normal allocator .
As it turns out , you really should n't use valloc ( ) to get this kind of alignment .
That was just boneheaded .
valloc ( ) gives not just 16 - byte alignment but ( on our machines ) 4096 byte alignment .
That 's like 4080 bytes better !
It also has the horrible side effect of potentially fragmenting memory into pieces .
This is exactly what was happening in our case .
Switching to a more sane memalign ( ) caused the problem to go away ( or , at least , cause the half - life of the problem to be pushed beyond our acceptance horizon ) .
* The fallout : * This bug actually took close to two months to finally track down .
The reason it took so long was because of the other experiments we had to run for a week each to convince ourselves it was n't going to crash in the same way .
And then the experiments seemed to point in the wrong direction ( an assembly or threading bug ) .
Anyway , we decided to add some real memory recovery code to our application .
More importantly , we learned the danger of memory fragmentation first hand .
Memory , again , maybe
* What happened : * I was improving one of our internal programs that operated on huge amounts of data in batch .
You could n't fit all of the uncompressed data in memory at once , so you had to uncompress a chunk , do your work , free the uncompressed chunk , and start on the next chunk .
Very occasionally , the free ( ) call appeared to fail .
It appeared that that chunk just stayed in memory , and it would go to expand the next chunk , causing the system to start swapping and crawling to a halt .
It appeared to be some kind of memory leak .
* How we attacked it : * This was the ultimate heisenbug .
Every single time I tried to probe the executable , the bizarre behavior would vanish .
Run it through valgrind , it vanished .
Change the compile flags , it vanished .
Use a malloc ( ) debug replacement , it vanished .
Write a custom version of malloc ( ) to track simple issues , it vanished .
Put a print statement in the offending code , it vanished .
Attach gdb , of course , it vanished .
* What caused it : * Well , uhm , that 's a funny story .
After about two weeks of trying everything under the sun , it stopped happening .
I do n't know what I changed .
I tried reverting my changes bit by bit .
I tried a fresh check out .
I did everything I could to reproduce this bug , and I could n't .
And I can't fix a bug I can't reproduce .
The fallout : Maybe it was a bad object file getting into the build by accident .
Maybe it was a pathological linux kernel issue .
Maybe it was a pathological malloc issue .
Maybe I am crazy .
Maybe .
Maybe there 's a landmine sitting in that program waiting to explode at some later date .
How about you ?
Got any stories ?
( CNN ) -- The U.S. Senate gave final approval Friday to a $ 787 billion recovery package that President Obama hopes will help boost an economy in freefall with a combination of government spending and tax cuts and credits .
Sen. Sherrod Brown speaks to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid at right on the Senate floor Friday .
Approved earlier by the House , the plan -- which went through multiple permutations as it bounced back and forth on Capitol Hill over the past week -- now goes to Obama 's desk , where he plans to sign it into law by Presidents Day .
Spending in the package includes about $ 120 billion for infrastructure -- new projects repairing bridges , roads , government buildings and the like -- more than $ 100 billion for education and $ 30 billion on energy - related projects that Obama says will create " green jobs . "
More than $ 212 billion goes to tax breaks for individuals and businesses , and another $ 267 billion is in direct spending like food stamps and unemployment benefits .
The Congressional Budget Office has predicted that the plan will create between 1 million and 3 million jobs .
Most individuals will get a $ 400 tax credit , and couples will get $ 800 .
The vote by the Senate took several hours longer than a simple roll call of its 100 members generally would .
Sen. Sherrod Brown , a Democrat from Ohio , attended a wake for his mother until about 8 p.m. Friday .
Voting began about 5:30 p.m .
Then , the Senate chamber sat nearly empty until Brown arrived to vote about five hours later .
He was flown from Ohio to Washington on a plane provided by the White House , which said no commercial flights were available that would have allowed Brown to cast a vote and return to Ohio in time for his mother 's funeral Saturday .
As had been the case when the original version of the package passed , the stimulus package garnered no Republican support in the House .
The compromise legislation , which was hammered out by House and Senate leaders and White House staff over the past several days , passed in the House on a 246 - 183 vote .
Three Republicans -- Susan Collins and Olympia Snow of Maine and Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania -- supported it in the Senate .
Their support was needed to give the plan the 60 votes needed to keep it from being shut down by Republican parliamentary procedures .
All Democrats in the Senate supported the plan .
Seven House Democrats opposed it .
Although the package was signed off on by leadership Thursday , a written version was n't available to most lawmakers until about 11 p.m .
Some Republicans in the House expressed frustration over how little time they had to read the 1,000 - plus - page bill , and others predicted ruin if it passed .
Watch the stimulus pass without GOP support »
" Just because Republicans spent too much money after September 11 and lost our way on financial matters does n't mean the Democratic party should be allowed to wreck our ship of state , " said Rep. Zach Wamp , R - Tennessee .
" This is taking us quickly down the wrong road .
Vote no . "
Watch the GOP say ' Americans deserve better ' »
Other lawmakers , however , said they were hopeful the stimulus plan would get the economy back on track .
" We know this bill alone will not solve all of our economic woes overnight .
We know that the road back to economic stability and prosperity will require hard work over time , " said Rep. Ed Perlmutter , D - Colorado .
" But this bill is the right size and scope necessary to truly help us turn things around . "
Sen . Edward Kennedy , D - Massachusetts , who returned to Capitol Hill for votes this week , was not present for the final vote because he returned to Florida to continue his recovery from brain cancer .
The bill passed the Senate 60 - 38 .
Here 's how the compromise bill is expected to affect individuals :
Most individuals will get a $ 400 tax credit , and most couples will get an $ 800 credit .
That amounts to an extra $ 13 a week in a person 's paycheck , starting in June .
That 's less than what Obama campaigned on : $ 500 for individuals and $ 1,000 per couple .
Many students will get a $ 2,500 tuition tax credit .
First - time home buyers may qualify for a tax credit of up to $ 8,000 .
People who receive Social Security will get a one - time payment of $ 250 .
The overall package is estimated to be 35 percent tax cuts and 65 percent spending , Democratic sources said .
CNN 's Ted Barrett , Dana Bash , Lisa Desjardins , Evan Glass , Mark Preston and Deirdre Walsh contributed to this report .

Cruise Specialists Picks Top Five Most Captivating Shore Excursions for 2009
The award winning luxury cruise agency selects favorites around the world Overland tours are overnight trips to a specific destination and a great way to be able to spend more time in a country and take a closer look at its celebrated sites A lot of popular spots are inland and inaccessible to ships , so overland trips are becoming more appealing to travelers because people want to make the most of their time in each port .
They realize that it may be their one and only chance to see it .
It is very important to book your shore excursions , specifically more detailed overland tours , through the cruise line or a reputable company like Cruise Specialists
If you book with an unknown agency , you have no guarantee that someone will show up to meet you on the day of the tour .
When a cruise ship pulls into a new port , many savvy travelers are looking for an unforgettable experience that will help them appreciate and understand the land they are visiting , and typically that requires exploring a destination for longer than a few hours .
Cruise Specialists , www.CruiseSpecialists.com, offers clients the opportunity to participate in a range of exciting and memorable overland tours available on many cruise itineraries planned through their exclusive shore excursion program .
" Overland tours are overnight trips to a specific destination and a great way to be able to spend more time in a country and take a closer look at its celebrated sites , " explained Heather Visser , the Shore Excursion Manager for Cruise Specialists who has traveled extensively around the world and spent seven years onboard world cruises arranging shore excursions and lecturing at ports .
" A lot of popular spots are inland and inaccessible to ships , so overland trips are becoming more appealing to travelers because people want to make the most of their time in each port .
They realize that it may be their one and only chance to see it . "
Cruise Specialists ' shore excursion department ( http://www.cruisespecialists.com/pages/Shore-Excursion.aspx) has picked the five most captivating overland tours to take in 2009 :
1. Victoria Falls , Africa : - One of the most spectacular natural wonders of the world is Victoria Falls in South Africa .
In this area , where the countries of Zambia , Zimbabwe and Botswana all meet , there is an opportunity for a wide range of experiences .
Besides viewing the awesome Victoria Falls , travelers can visit local villages , ride elephants , walk with lions , go on safari and much more .
2. Temples of Angkor Wat - Siem Reap , Cambodia : -
These awe - inspiring ancient temples in the mysterious royal cities in Cambodia are a must see .
The Angkor Wat temple is the largest in the world and took close to 40 years to complete .
Because of heavy tourism , they are slowly " crumbling " and may be inaccessible in the future .
After exploring many of the great ancient temples , guests will also enjoy an Aspara dance performance based upon the statues and sculptures found in the temples that reflect the beauty and spirituality of Cambodian culture .
3. Machu Picchu / City of Cusco , Peru : -
One of the seven wonders of the world and often described as one of the most spiritual places in the world , visiting Machu Picchu and the Sacred Valley of the Incas should be on every traveler 's to do list .
Staying overnight at an award - winning lodge in the heart of the Machu Picchu Historical Sanctuary gives guests more time to explore the ruins , go hiking , visit local markets , and interact with local Peruvians .
4. Giant Pandas - Chengdu , China : - Pandas are unique to this area and visitors have the opportunity to closely observe their daily activities at the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding which rescues pandas and conducts research to preserve the species .
This tour is operated in combination with a visit to see the famous Terra Cotta Warriors in Xi'an .
At the Terra Cotta Warriors museum , travelers will see several thousand life size terra cotta warriors and horses created in 384 B.C. at the order of the first Chinese emperor , Qin Shi Huang .
5. Cairo / Luxor , Egypt : -
This trip to the pyramids and ruins in Egypt is fascinating and full of history .
Guests will enjoy a private lecture on the area by Dr. Zahi Hawas , the secretary general of Egypt 's Supreme Council of Antiquities .
Other special additions to this excursion include lunch on a felucca ( traditional wooden sailing boat ) in Luxor , special front row seating at the Pyramids Sound and Light Show in Cairo and admission into the Mummies Room at the Egyptian Museum of Antiquities , housing eleven Royal Kings and Queens of Ancient Egypt including the recently - identified Queen Hatshepsut mummy .
According to Visser , travelers have learned that while overland tours are more expensive than day trips , it is well worth the extraordinary experience and gives them better value for their money in the long run .
" It is very important to book your shore excursions , specifically more detailed overland tours , through the cruise line or a reputable company like Cruise Specialists , " added Visser .
" If you book with an unknown agency , you have no guarantee that someone will show up to meet you on the day of the tour . "
The long , challenging technological march from the low - power light bulb Thomas Edison invented to the ultimate in a bright and energy - efficient lighting device may reach fruition in work led by the two Arizona State University researchers .
A recent story in the journal Advanced Materials , details advances in the use of organic light - emitting diodes ( OLEDs ) by Ghassan Jabbour and Jian Li , with help from graduate students Evan Williams and Kirsi Haavisto , a Fulbright scholar from Finland .
These researchers have developed an organic lighting device with “ 100 percent internal quantum efficiency ” by employing newly designed host materials coupled with optimized device architecture .
Internal quantum efficiency involves the number of photons generated inside the device per each electron from the electricity source – such as a battery .
What 's particularly significant about the researchers ' work is that their optimized device adopts an even simpler structure than any yet reported by other research groups .
“ There is no waste of electricity , ” Jabbour says .
“ All the current you are putting into the device is being used to produce light .
It 's the first time something like this has been demonstrated .
Nobody else has shown a 100 percent internal quantum efficiency for lighting devices using a single molecular dopant to emit white light . ”
The achievement promises significant progress in the development of solid - state lighting based on OLED technology that can be manufactured at low costs .
Such devices also could provide a major source for progress in global environmental efforts to conserve energy and natural resources .
In addition to progress in energy conservation , the work also could accelerate advances in semiconductor technology materials through improvements in low - power organic thin - film transistors , an area Jabbour and Li's group is researching intensely .
Jabbour is a professor and Li is an assistant professor in the new ASU School of Materials , which is jointly administered by the Ira A. Fulton School of Engineering and the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences .

One Last Continue writes : " Since the launch of Sony and Media Molecule 's LittleBigPlanet , thousands of user - created levels have been posted on the Playstation Network .
Some are completely new , some tributes to games of old … but you 've never seen one quite like this .
Just a few short weeks ago , a group of posters on the NeoGAF forums set out on a mission - a rather dangerous mission , you might say .
Their objective ?
To recreate the entirety of Konami's NES shooter smash hit , Contra , using LittleBigPlanet .
Since then , the seven members of the LittleBig Contra team have toiled away , studying the maps , tilesets , and sprites of the original Contra for research .
And I 'm pleased to report this evening that their mission is an absolute success . "

The 10 - year occupation left a million Afghans dead and the country in ruins
As Russia marks the 20th anniversary of its withdrawal from Afghanistan , officials in Moscow are warning that US and Nato - led forces are making exactly the same mistakes as the Soviet Union made when it invaded the country in 1979 .
The BBC's Richard Galpin has been speaking to experts and veterans , who remember the withdrawal after 10 years of occupation as a traumatic and humiliating experience .
Lt Gen Ruslan Aushev , a Hero of the Soviet Union , sports a moustache that hangs over his mouth like a heavy velvet curtain .
But from the dark morass emerge words of precision and directness that befit a much - decorated commander of the Soviet military venture in Afghanistan in the 1980s .
" We were there for 10 years and we lost more than 14,000 soldiers , but what was the result ?
Nothing , " he tells me as we sit in his office on one of central Moscow 's most fashionable streets .
We wanted to bring peace and stability to Afghanistan , but in fact everything got worse
Lt Gen ( retd ) Ruslan Aushev
Former Soviet commander " [ After the Soviet withdrawal ] there was a second civil war and then the Taleban appeared .
We wanted to bring peace and stability to Afghanistan , but in fact everything got worse , " he adds .
Such frank admissions of failure are common amongst the Russian veterans who are attending a series of commemorative events this weekend , exactly 20 years after the last Soviet troops left Afghanistan .
Experts say the Soviet government under Leonid Brezhnev had assumed their invasion in December 1979 would bring rapid results , stabilising the fledgling communist government in Kabul and thus ensuring the loyalty of an important neighbouring country at the height of the Cold War .
But instead of being able to leave within six months , the Soviet forces became bogged down in a protracted conflict with a tough and well - armed guerrilla force which received massive assistance from the West and the Muslim world .
Some of the Mujahideen , as the loosely - aligned groups of rebels became known , were radical Islamists for whom the fight against the godless communists was a jihad .
And crucially , the rebels enjoyed the support of the population .
Bitter experience Now just 20 years later , the Russians are looking with astonishment at the way the US and Nato - led forces are waging their war in Afghanistan .
The conflict cannot be solved by military means , it 's an illusion
Col ( retd ) Oleg Kulakov
The view from Moscow is that the Western forces have learned nothing from the bitter experience of the Soviet Union .
Instead , they are falling into exactly the same trap .
One prime example is the current plan by the US to send tens of thousands of extra troops .
" Doubling their forces wo n't lead to a solution on the ground , " says Col Oleg Kulakov , who served twice in Afghanistan and is now a lecturer and historian in Moscow .
" The conflict can not be solved by military means , it 's an illusion , " he adds .
" No - one can reach any political goal in Afghanistan relying on military force .
Frankly speaking , they are doomed to repeat our mistakes . "
Parallels
There are many striking parallels .
Once again , invading foreign forces in Afghanistan are trying to stabilise a foreigner - friendly government .
Soviet tips for Afghanistan troops
Once again , they are facing a rebellion by Islamist militants who just happen to have a different generic name this time , " the Taleban " .
Once again , the rebellion is growing in strength and has increasing support from the population as the occupation drags on inflicting a mounting number of civilian casualties .
Sir Roderick Braithwaite a former British ambassador to Moscow , fears that the US and Nato - led intervention in Afghanistan could prove to be as disastrous as that of the Soviet Union .
" We went in with a limited objective to start with , but like the Russians hoping that they could build socialism in Afghanistan , we hoped we could build democracy , " he says .
" We have n't got enough troops there to dominate the territory and we have a government in Kabul whose authority barely runs inside the capital , let alone outside it . "
As in the 1980s , foreign forces are facing a rebellion by Islamist militants " We have no long - term strategy and unlike the Russians we have been there for eight years without even beginning to plan to leave , " he adds .
But other experts are not quite so apocalyptic .
" The mission now is quite different from the Soviet war , " says Gregory Feifer , who has just written a book on the Soviet experience in Afghanistan .
" Crucially even seven years into the occupation , there a critical mass of Afghans who still want the mission to succeed ... there is still a small window of opportunity left . "

A Cambridge laboratory has developed a special ink for tattoos that changes color based on glucose levels in the blood .
On a related note , diabetes is now the hippest metabolic syndrome in town .
Advertisement
The ink is made up of a bunch of tiny spheres , about 120 nanometers across , that contain " the glucose detecting molecule , a color - changing dye , and another molecule that mimics glucose . "
Those molecules are moving around in the spheres , and when they near the surface , they grab onto either glucose or the molecule that mimics glucose .
If they mostly latch onto real glucose , the ink ( and consequently the tattoo ) will look yellow , but if they grab the fake glucose , the tatt will look purple , indicating a low level of glucose in the bloodstream .
Apparently the tattoo itself does n't need to be a full - sleeve naked pirate lady design or anything ; it can be only a few millimeters across and get the job done .
The tech is still a couple years off , but it 's a much more immediate and constant monitor of the blood than having to prick and swab a few times a day .
[ Crunchgear ]
For most of the past century , Britain 's secret state bugged , blacklisted and spied on leftists , trade unionists and peace campaigners , as well as Irish republicans and anyone else regarded as a " subversive " threat to the established order .
That was all supposed to have been brought to a halt in the wake of the end of the cold war in the early 1990s .
MI5 now boasts it has ended its counter - subversion work altogether , having other jihadist fish to fry ( it will have soon doubled its staffing and budget on the back of the 9/11 backlash ) .
Whether those claims should be taken at face value must be open to question .
But it now turns out that other arms of the secret state have in any case been stepping up to the plate to fill the gap in the market .
The Association of Chief Police Officers ( Acpo ) insists that its confidential intelligence unit – reported last week to be now coordinating surveillance and infiltration of " domestic extremists " , including anti-war protesters and strikers – is not in fact a new organisation , but has been part of its public order intelligence operations since 1999 , liaising with MI5 and its 44 forces ' special branch outfits across the country .
But yes ,
Acpo's spokesman tells me , it is in the business of targeting groups such as those involved in the recent Gaza war protests , trade unionists taking part in secondary industrial action and animal rights organisations – though only if they break the law or " seek to break the law " .
Now , that qualification could be used to cover a very wide group of political and industrial activists indeed : including all those students who have been occupying university buildings since the new year in protest at Israel 's carnage in the Palestinian territories ; all those engineering construction workers who staged mass walkouts at refineries and power stations over the past couple of weeks ; and all those who blocked streets – or threw their shoes at police – around the Israeli embassy in London at the height of the Gaza bombardment in January .
Add to that the fact that Acpo , and the government as a whole for that matter , bandies around the term " extremism " without being able to make even a face - saving stab at what it actually means – " there does n't seem to be a single , commonly agreed definition " , Acpo's spokesman concedes – and you have a recipe for a new lease of life for the harassment and criminalisation of legitimate dissent , protest and industrial action .
In case there were any doubt about the kind of thing this intelligence outfit is up to , a recent advertisement for its new boss specified that the unit would be specifically working with government departments , university authorities and private corporations to " remove the threat " of " public disorder that arises from domestic extremism " using " secret data " and " sensitive source material " .
But since Acpo operates as a private company outside the Freedom of Information Act – and the budget and staffing of its confidential intelligence unit are , well , confidential – who 's going to hold them to genuine account ?
It is this kind of blurring of the distinction between political violence and non-violent protest that has seen catch - all anti-terrorist legislation routinely abused in recent years .
That 's exactly what seems to have happened over the weekend , when police arrested nine people on the M65 motorway near Preston allegedly on their way to join George Galloway 's Viva Palestina aid convoy to Gaza .
Security sources said the arrests were in connection with a " potential threat of terrorism in the Middle East " — and it seems they did n't mean a renewed Israeli use of white phosphorus and heavy artillery shells against Palestinian civilians in the Gaza strip .
Six have already been released , but the operation instantly delivered a " Galloway aid convoy link to terror suspects " headline in yesterday 's Mail on Sunday , casting a shadow over the 150 - vehicle convoy , including 12 ambulances and a fire engine , which is intended to transport £ 1 m worth of aid and highlight the humanitarian crisis in Gaza .
The crudely politicised timing of these arrests — " security sources " have been quoted as saying the three still being held had been under surveillance for two months – underlines how easy it is to play anti-democratic political games once the mantras of terrorism and national security have been invoked .
But the net can be thrown far wider under the even more meaningless badge of " extremism " .
Ukraine says it has enough reserves to last for months Russian gas giant Gazprom has accused Ukraine of stealing gas meant for other European countries .
" The Ukrainian side openly admits it is stealing gas and has no shame about it , " company spokesman Sergei Kupriyanov said .
The accusation came after Russia ceased shipments of gas to Ukraine on Thursday amid a row over payments and prices .
Ukraine 's state gas company denied illegally siphoning Russian gas , saying it was ensuring the export supply .
Ukraine has insisted it will not interfere with gas transported from Russia to other states via its pipelines , as it has enough gas in its reserves to look after its own needs for some time .
EU countries have not reported any reduction in gas deliveries via Ukraine .
Europe 's gas pipeline network
Enlarge Map
Valentin Zemlyansky , a spokesman for Ukraine 's state gas company Naftogaz , told AFP news agency in Kiev that his country was " not stealing gas " .
" We are removing gas for technical purposes , in order to ensure the transit of Russian exports , " he said .
Naftogaz said earlier it was diverting some gas to maintain pressure in the pipeline network .
Still pumping Ferran Tarradellas , spokesman for EU Energy Commissioner Andris Piebalgs , told AFP that volumes of gas received were still normal as of Friday morning .
Pipes across Ukraine carry about a fifth of the EU 's gas needs .
A similar row between Gazprom and Ukraine at the beginning of 2006 led to gas shortages in several EU countries .
The EU has urged Russia and Ukraine to resume negotiations and not to let the dispute disrupt supplies to Europe .
But a spokesman for the Czech Republic , the current holder of the EU presidency , said at the moment it was " a bilateral problem " .
" We are not going to interfere until the moment when the pressure of gas will reach low limits , " he added .
The Gazprom spokesman also said Ukraine was limiting the amount of gas to be shipped to Europe on Saturday , to only 296 m cubic metres instead of the 303 m the Russian company had requested .
Talks between the two sides over the supply of gas to Ukraine broke down this week , as the 2008 deal expired .
There are several contentious issues Ukraine says it has paid $ 1.5 bn ( £ 1 bn ) in outstanding gas bills to Gazprom , via a Swiss company - but not late - payment fines .
A Gazprom spokesman said the money should clear by 11 January , but that $ 614 m would still be outstanding
Gazprom wants to increase the price Ukraine pays for gas , from the $ 179.50 per 1,000 cubic metres Kiev paid in 2008 .
Gazprom asked for $ 250 .
Naftogaz said no , then offered $ 235 .
Gazprom has withdrawn its first offer and now wants $ 418 - nearer the market rate
Ukraine wants to increase the amount it charges Gazprom for carrying Russian gas west .
Without an agreement , the two sides are negotiating prices and amounts day by day Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko said on Thursday he was hopeful that negotiations on a new contract could be completed by 7 January , and that the sides were " close to a compromise " .
But it is not clear when talks between the two parties will resume .
A Ukrainian delegation has been visiting Prague and Brussels , seeking support , while Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Grushko called for an emergency session of the European Parliament , where Russia could present its case .

The monad found its way into Haskell from E. Moggi ’s research in the late 1980s integrating Category Theory into the domain of programming language semantics .
He began by observing that there are three common approaches to proving equivalence of programs :
Operational semantics
Denotational semantics
Model theoretic semantics
All such methods attempt to bridge the syntax / semantics divide .
They differ chiefly in the formalisms they adopt to represent the semantic domain , with attendant differences in the syntax - to - semantics mapping .
Moggi ’s innovation was to use Category Theory to represent the semantic domain .
His motivation was the observation that the conventional denotational approach , which identifies type $ \alpha \rightarrow \ beta$ with a total function of the same signature , “ wipes out completely behaviours like non-termination , non-determinism or side - effects , that can be exhibited by real programs . ”
The key word being " behaviors " ; a direct mathematical mapping from terms in a language to objects in a semantic domain has no way of accounting for the behavior of terms like “ print ” , which trigger observable external behavior .
Whatever mathematical semantics such terms may have , they also carry additional meaning that cannot be captured by a straightforward denotational representation .
The key term he uses is notion of computation :
… in order to interpret a programming language in a category C , we distinguish the object A of values ( of type A ) from the object T A of computations ( of type A ) , and take as denotations of programs ( of type A ) the elements of T A .
In particular , we identify the type A with the object of values ( of type A ) and obtain the object of computations ( of type A ) by applying an unary type - constructor T to A .
We call T a notion of computation , since it abstracts away from the type of values computations may produce .
There are many choices for T A corresponding to different notions of computations .
( Notions of Computation and Monads )
He gives the following examples of " notion of computation " : partiality , non-determinism , side - effects , exceptions , continuations , and interactive input / output .
What these " notions " have in common is disruption of the semantic integrity of a program text .
They violate the principle of referential transparency , rendering the text literally uninterpretable to the human reader .
So " notions of computation " effectively means the class of opaque terms in programming languages .
In ordinary mathematical notation , as for any formal notation intended for human readers , there are no such opaque terms .
There may be terms that are unfamiliar to the reader , but these are unknown , not opaque .
They have definite denotation , whereas opaque terms only acquire a denotation when the program is executed as a process on a computing machine .
Their semantics are contingent , in contrast to terms like " 2 + 3 " , which have necessary semantics .
This appears to be an insurmountable and lethal problem for the formal semantics of functional programming languages .
One goal for the development of functional languages is the elimination of process considerations from the semantics of the language .
It should be possible to reason about the meaning of a program text without reference to the process associated with it at run-time .
If the language includes opaque terms whose semantics are contingent on the process , then how can it be possible to eliminate processing logic from the semantics ?
How could one ever hope to prove two programs equivalent ?
Moggi simply restated the problem with a different focus : opaque , contingent terms may be unknowns , but they are known unknowns .
We know who and where they are in a text , so instead of asking how we can reason about them , we ask how we can represent and manage them in such a way that the semantic integrity of the text as a whole is retained .
We know they denote , but we do n't know their denotations ; we know they behave , but since formal semantics is atemporal , we do n't know the order in which they will acquire their behaviors .
So the problem is twofold : we must find a way to represent them as ordinary mathematical values , and can we must find a way to ensure that their behavior is properly disciplined .
Moggi 's brilliant solution was to use the strong typing of Category Theory as a representational device , and to use the monad as an organizing device .
Categories are strongly typed ; they provide us with a means to both represent and sequester opaque terms and their contingent values .
Sequestration follows naturally from type discipline : objects of a category representing opaque terms with their contingent values cannot naturally mix with objects of any other category .
Since they are ordinary objects , they are integrated into the formal semantics of the language as a whole .
Functors are the means by which we " construct " such objects ;
The fact that they serve as proxies for behaviors does not disrupt this integration ; they remain objects .
In Moggi 's formulation , it is the functor that encodes the notion of computation , each constructed object representing a different notion .
This is a clever construction of functor as a mathematical operation with side effects , but it is indisputably a mere metaphor for expository purposes .
Functors do n't have side effects , but that need not stop us from using them to model executable operations that do .
Behavioral discipline follows from the structural properties of the monad .
The Kleisli star of category theory and its Haskell counterpart »= use data dependency to impose an ordering on their arguments .
The semantics of the program text remain atemporal , but when the text is represented as a process , the data dependency will ensure proper ordering of behaviors .
If the language of categories and functors makes you queasy , here is how Wadler et al. used Moggi 's insights to engineer a solution in Haskell .
The Haskell equivalents to category and functor are the type and type constructor .
A type T A is the image of type A under the mapping of the functor T . What Moggi called notions of computation , and I have called opaque terms and their associated contingent denotations , others have called variously actions , computations , processes , programs , and so forth .
Whatever we choose to call them , Haskell represents them as values of a constructed type - IO a and so forth .
Haskell 's strong typing serves to sequester them in their type , unable to interact with values of other types .
They are first - class values in the semantic model of Haskell , with no side - effects within the language .
At run-time , they may have observable behaviors ; the Haskell bind operator »= , which implements the Kleisli star of CT , imposes an evaluation order on its arguments .
This use of category theory is an absolutely dazzling manoever .
A very distinctive feature of category theory is that it erases the distinction between things and relations ; " it is technically possible to dispense altogether with the objects and work only with arrows , " in the words of its co-inventor Saunders Mac Lane .
And thus it is possible to do this with " notions of computation " : we can disregard them .
The fact that , for example , values of type IO a have some kind of observable side - effect at run-time is irrelevant to the formal semantics of the language .
Since they are represented as objects in purely categorical terms , using functors and natural transformations , we can dispense with them and transfer our attention to the morphisms - constructors , bind , etc .
In other words , we can think of these things not as values ( with additional behavior ) but as a nexus of relationships encoded as arrows .
So when asked , what is a value of type IO , we can justly respond with an imperious : " Faugh !
It means nothing to me !
But if you must know , go run the program ! "

Mothers that have led rich lives may have offspring with longer memories .
The offspring of environmentally enriched mice performed better in memory tests .
Punchstock
A mother 's early experiences in life may shape the memories of her children .
Researchers in the United States have shown that genetically induced memory defects in mice can be reversed by providing the mice with a stimulating environment .
And what 's more , female mice seem to pass these benefits on to their offspring without any changes to the DNA sequence responsible for the defect1 .
Biochemist Larry Feig from Tufts University School of Medicine in Boston , Massachusetts , and leader of the group , says that if their results can be repeated in humans , " it really suggests that the effectiveness of one 's memory can be influenced by the environmental stimulation experienced by the mother in her youth " .
Emma Whitelaw , who studies mammalian gene expression at the Queensland Institute of Medical Research in Australia , says that the differences between human and mouse neurobiology may confound such simple translation .
Still , she says the finding is " fascinating " , because it suggests that an interesting trait can be passed on down through the generations without changes to gene sequence .
" What is really nice about this study , " she adds , " is that it is moving to behavioural phenotypes and the brain 's ability to remember and think , and I think that is powerful " .
Stimulating the brain
The team came to the finding through a circuitous path .
Feig 's group had originally been studying cancer genes when they created a knockout mouse that had deficits in long - term potentiation , a strengthening of neuronal connections that seems to be related to memory formation .
As lab animals that are given more opportunity to explore , socialize and exercise are known to develop stronger neuronal connections and better memory , Shaomin Li , Feig 's postdoc at the time , decided to see whether such environmental enrichment would have any effect on the knockouts .
In 2006 , the researchers showed that 14 - day - old knockout mice that were exposed to enriched environments for two weeks did indeed show much higher long term potentiation than those raised in conventional cages , and that this improvement lasted for several months .
The ' enriched ' mice also performed about as well as normal mice in a fear - conditioning test of their memory — tending to freeze with fear when returned to a cage where they had formerly received a mild electric shock .
Furthermore , the improvements seemed to be due to the activation of a biochemical pathway that assists in long - term potentiation and masks the effect of the knocked - out gene2 .
In the current study , published today in the Journal of Neuroscience1 , the researchers looked at the offspring of such environmentally enriched knockout mice .
They found that the offspring have activity in this same pathway .
Like their parents , they have higher long term potentiation and do better in fear - conditioning tests than their brethren born to unenriched females .
Enriched fathers impart no benefits .
Thanks for the memories
The mental boost for mice born to enriched females wanes after about two months , and their subsequent offspring gain no such memory improvements .
Although the mechanism by which the mice pass on their smarts is unclear , Feig speculates that enrichment produces a hormonal change in the mice that persists into adulthood and affects the offspring in utero , activating the auxiliary pathway for memory formation in their developing brains .
ADVERTISEMENT
Whitelaw agrees that because the effect is short - lived it does n't look like changes are being made to the mother 's egg cells .
Nevertheless , her lab and others have identified heritable traits in mice , such as chemical marks that change the way DNA is regulated , that seem to affect the germline directly and persist for multiple generations .
Such epigenetic changes — alterations that are inherited even though the DNA sequence has n't been affected — may provide clues about the origins of traits and diseases that seem to be inherited but for which no genetic contributors can be found ( see ' The case of the missing heritability ' ) .
" It really matters , " says Whitelaw .
" There 's increasing evidence that the environment an embryo grows up in can have fairly permanent consequences . "

The latest development in the Blago - picks - Burris , Burris - lies - about - contacts - with - Blago ’s - people , Blago - gets - booted - out - of - office , Burris - gets - caught - lying - ( multiple - times ) saga is that Illinois Governor Pat Quinn ( ah…always nice to type that ! ) has now called on Roland Burris to resign his seat in the US Senate .

Oh , the wheels of Illinois politics – or even just the tireless rims at times – keep on a -spinning !
" At this time , we have a senator who has a cloud over his head , " Quinn said at a news conference .
" It 's time [ for Burris ] to put the interest of the people of the ‘ Land of Lincoln ’ ahead of his own and step aside and resign from office . "
There was no immediate response from Burris , but …really – does anyone think that a guy so immodest that he already had a massive self - monument erected ( chiseled with details on all his " pioneering " elective accomplishments ) on the plot where he will eventually be buried would just shrug and walk away from the pinnacle of his public - service career …even if the details around it are as deeply embarrassing as they have become ?
C’mon , Gov .
Pat – you apparently do n’t know the Full Roland …he ain’t going anywhere voluntarily .
Accordingly , however , the Senate Ethics Committee has launched an investigation of Burris and his actions and statements that may result in his censure ( nah , dial it up there ! ) or even expulsion ( now , THAT ’s the ticket ! ) from the Senate .
Quinn added that he supports a bill introduced in the Illinois legislature that would set up a special election for all future US Senate vacancies …and , in almost a humorous aside , he also said of Burris , " At this time , [ for him ] to step away and resign [ would be ] a heroic act … "
Yep – look out for the somewhat diminutive , 71 - year - old guy zooming around in a sharp suit with an ever - growing Pinocchio nose :
Our timeless hero , Sen. Roland Burris …
… Hmm – I wonder if there ’s still enough room left on that premature Burris tribute monument over at Oak Woods Cemetery to chisel in another line of inscription : " First US Senator from IL – since the disgraced Frank L. Smith in the 1920s – to be kicked out of the Senate … "

CARGO CULTS
Russian
In The Life of Brian , one of the many things the Monty Python team got right was the extreme rapidity with which a new religious cult can get started .
It can spring up almost overnight and then become incorporated into a culture , where it plays a disquietingly dominant role .
The ' cargo cults ' of Pacific Melanesia and New Guinea provide the most famous real life example .
The entire history of some of these cults , from initiation to expiry , is wrapped up within living memory .
Unlike the cult of Jesus , the origins of which are not reliably attested , we can see the whole course of events laid out before our eyes ( and even here , as we shall see , some details are now lost ) .
It is fascinating to guess that the cult of Christianity almost certainly began in very much the same way , and spread initially at the same high speed .
My main authority for the cargo cults is David Attenborough 's Quest in Paradise , which he very kindly presented to me .
The pattern is the same for all of them , from the earliest cults in the nineteenth century to the more famous ones that grew up in the aftermath of the Second World War .
It seems that in every case the islanders were bowled over by the wondrous possessions of the white immigrants to their islands , including administrators , soldiers and missionaries .
They were perhaps the victims of ( Arthur C. ) Clarke 's Third Law , which I quoted in Chapter 2 : ' Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic '
The islanders noticed that the white people who enjoyed these wonders never made them themselves .
When articles needed repairing they were sent away , and new ones kept arriving as ' cargo ' in ships or , later , planes .
No white man was ever seen to make or repair anything , nor indeed did they do anything that could be recognized as useful work of any kind ( sitting behind a desk shuffling papers was obviously some kind of religious devotion ) .
Evidently , then , the ' cargo ' must be of supernatural origin .
As if in corroboration of this , the white men did do certain things that could only have been ritual ceremonies :
They build tall masts with wires attached to them ; they sit listening to small boxes that glow with light and emit curious noises and strangled voices ; they persuade the local people to dress up in identical clothes , and march them up and down - and it would hardly be possible to devise a more useless occupation than that .
And then the native realizes that he has stumbled on the answer to the mystery .
It is these incomprehensible actions that are the rituals employed by the white man to persuade the gods to send the cargo .
If the native wants the cargo , then he too must do these things .
It is striking that similar cargo cults sprang up independently on islands that were widely separated both geographically and culturally .
David Attenborough tells us that
Anthropologists have noted two separate outbreaks in New Caledonia , four in the Solomons , four in Fiji , seven in the New Hebrides , and over fifty in New Guinea , most of them being quite independent and unconnected with one another .
The majority of these religions claim that one particular messiah will bring the cargo when the day of the apocalypse arrives .
The independent flowering of so many independent but similar cults suggests some unifying features of human psychology in general .
One famous cult on the island of Tanna in the New Hebrides ( known as Vanuatu since 1980 ) is still extant .
It is centred on a messianic figure called John Frum .
References to John Frum in official government records go back only as far as 1940 but , even for so recent a myth , it is not known for certain whether he ever existed as a real man .
One legend described him as a little man with a high - pitched voice and bleached hair , wearing a coat with shining buttons .
He made strange prophecies , and he went out of his way to turn the people against the missionaries .
Eventually he returned to the ancestors , after promising a triumphal second coming , bearing bountiful cargo .
His apocalyptic vision included a ' great cataclysm ; the mountains would fall flat and the valleys would be filled ; * old people would regain their youth and sickness would vanish ; the white people would be expelled from the island never to return ; and cargo would arrive in great quantity so that everybody would have as much as he wanted ' .
* Compare Isaiah 40 : 4 : ' Every valley shall be exalted , and every mountain and hill shall be made low . '
This similarity does n't necessarily indicate any fundamental feature of the human psyche , or Jungian ' collective unconscious ' .
These islands had long been infested with missionaries .
Most worryingly for the government , John Frum also prophesied that , on his second coming , he would bring a new coinage , stamped with the image of a coconut .
The people must therefore get rid of all their money of the white man 's currency .
In 1941 this led to a wild spending spree ; the people stopped working and the island 's economy was seriously damaged .
The colonial administrators arrested the ringleaders but nothing that they could do would kill the cult , and the mission churches and schools became deserted .
A little later , a new doctrine grew up that John Frum was King of America .
Providentially , American troops arrived in the New Hebrides around this time and , wonder of wonders , they included black men who were not poor like the islanders but
as richly endowed with cargo as the white soldiers .
Wild excitement overwhelmed Tanna .
The day of the apocalypse was imminent .
It seemed that everyone was preparing for the arrival of John Frum .
One of the leaders said that John Frum would be coming from America by aeroplane and hundreds of men began to clear the bush in the centre of the island so that the plane might have an airstrip on which to land .
The airstrip had a bamboo control tower with ' air traffic controllers ' wearing dummy headphones made of wood .
There were dummy planes on the ' runway ' to act as decoys , designed to lure down John Frum 's plane .
In the 1950s , the young David Attenborough sailed to Tanna with a cameraman , Geoffrey Mulligan , to investigate the cult of John Frum .
They found plenty of evidence of the religion and were eventually introduced to its high priest , a man called Nambas .
Nambas referred to his messiah familiarly as John , and claimed to speak regularly to him , by ' radio ' .
This ( ' radio belong John ' ) consisted of an old woman with an electric wire around her waist who would fall into a trance and talk gibberish , which Nambas interpreted as the words of John Frum .
Nambas claimed to have known in advance that Attenborough was coming to see him , because John Frum had told him on the ' radio ' .
Attenborough asked to see the ' radio ' but was ( understandably ) refused .
He changed the subject and asked whether Nambas had seen John Frum :
Nambas nodded vigorously .
' Me see him plenty time . '
' What does he look like ? '
Nambas jabbed his finger at me .
" E look like you .
'E got white face .
'E tall man .
' E live ' long South America . '
This detail contradicts the legend referred to above that John Frum was a short man .
Such is the way with evolving legends .
It is believed that the day of John Frum 's return will be 15 February , but the year is unknown .
Every year on 15 February his followers assemble for a religious ceremony to welcome him .
So far he has not returned , but they are not downhearted .
David Attenborough said to one cult devotee , called Sam :
' But , Sam , it is nineteen years since John say that the cargo will come .
He promise and he promise , but still the cargo does not come .
Is n't nineteen years a long time to wait ? '
Sam lifted his eyes from the ground and looked at me .
' If you can wait two thousand years for Jesus Christ to come an ' 'e no come , then I can wait more than nineteen years for John . '
Robert Buckman 's book Can We Be Good without God ? quotes the same admirable retort by a John Frum disciple , this time to a Canadian journalist some forty years after David Attenborough 's encounter .
The Queen and Prince Philip visited the area in 1974 , and the Prince subsequently became deified in a rerun of a John - Frum - type cult ( once again , note how rapidly the details in religious evolution can change ) .
The Prince is a handsome man who would have cut an imposing figure in his white naval uniform and plumed helmet , and it is perhaps not surprising that he , rather than the Queen , was elevated in this way , quite apart from the fact that the culture of the islanders made it difficult for them to accept a female deity .
I do n't want to make too much of the cargo cults of the South Pacific .
But they do provide a fascinating contemporary model for the way religions spring up from almost nothing .
In particular , they suggest four lessons about the origin of religions generally , and I 'll set them out briefly here .
First is the amazing speed with which a cult can spring up .
Second is the speed with which the origination process covers its tracks .
John Frum , if he existed at all , did so within living memory .
Yet , even for so recent a possibility , it is not certain whether he lived at all .
The third lesson springs from the independent emergence of similar cults on different islands .
The systematic study of these similarities can tell us something about human psychology and its susceptibility to religion .
Fourth , the cargo cults are similar , not just to each other but to older religions .
Christianity and other ancient religions that have spread worldwide presumably began as local cults like that of John Frum .
Indeed , scholars such as Geza Vermes , Professor of Jewish Studies at Oxford University , have suggested that Jesus was one of many such charismatic figures who emerged in Palestine around his time , surrounded by similar legends .
Most of those cults died away .
The one that survived , on this view , is the one that we encounter today .
And , as the centuries go by , it has been honed by further evolution ( memetic selection , if you like that way of putting it ; not if you do n't ) into the sophisticated system - or rather diverging sets of descendant systems - that dominate large parts of the world today .
The deaths of charismatic modern figures such as Haile Selassie , Elvis Presley and Princess Diana offer other opportunities to study the rapid rise of cults and their subsequent memetic evolution .
That is all I want to say about the roots of religion itself , apart from a brief reprise in Chapter 10 when I discuss the ' imaginary friend ' phenomenon of childhood under the heading of the psychological ' needs ' that religion fulfils .
Morality is often thought to have its roots in religion , and in the next chapter I want to question this view .
I shall argue that the origin of morality can itself be the subject of a Darwinian question .
Just as we asked :
What is the Darwinian survival value of religion ? , so we can ask the same question of morality .
Morality , indeed , probably predated religion .
Just as with religion we drew back from the question and rephrased it , so with morality we shall find that it is best seen as a by - product of something else .
Not known for their in - depth knowledge of quantum physics , camels may still have a role to play in explaining uncertainty in classical terms ( Image : Stock.xchng/Damo74 )
WHAT does a biblical saying about a camel passing through the eye of a needle have to do with quantum uncertainty ?
Quite a lot , it turns out , since a mathematical concept called the “ symplectic camel ” promises to explain quantum uncertainty in simple classical terms .
According to Heisenberg , it is impossible to measure both the momentum and position of a quantum particle accurately because those properties are interlinked .
Measuring one therefore makes the other more uncertain . …
Israel has denied allegations of illegal use of white phosphorus rounds
Amnesty International has called for a freeze on arms sales to Israel and Palestinian groups such as Hamas following the recent Gaza conflict .
The human rights group said it had evidence both Israel and Hamas had used weapons sourced from overseas to carry out attacks on civilians .
It called for the UN Security Council to impose the embargo on all parties .
Both Israel and Hamas have rejected the conclusions of the report , in which Amnesty accuses each of war crimes .
In the report , Israel is accused of illegally using white phosphorus and other armaments supplied by the US in Gaza , while Hamas is condemned for launching unguided rockets into Israel .

Israeli government spokesman Mark Regev told the BBC that Israel had used white phosphorus but not as an anti-personnel weapon .
The substance , which is used to lay smokescreens , is legal for use on open ground but its use in built - up areas where civilians are found is banned under international conventions .
" We tried to be as surgical as humanly possible in a difficult combat situation , " he said .
Mr Regev criticised Amnesty 's methodology , saying the report 's authors used what he called " tainted " data provided by Hamas .
He said Israel was conducting its own investigation into whether any of its munitions were used outside international law .
Hamas also criticised the report 's findings as " unjust and unfair " .
" It [ the report ] equates between the criminal and the victim , " said Hamas spokesman Fawzi Barhoum .
" There is not a single country in the world which exports weapons to the Hamas movement .
At the same time main countries , big countries and superpowers are exporting nuclear and phosphorus weapons , as well as weapons of mass destruction , to the Zionist occupier [ Israel ] . "
Israel launched an air strike on central Gaza on Monday after one of its patrols came under fire near the Kissufim border crossing but there were no immediate reports of casualties on either side .
A single rocket launched from Gaza also hit Israeli territory without causing injuries or damage , Israel 's military said .
The incidents came despite unilateral truces declared by both Israel and Hamas on 18 January .
Outgoing Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert has decided to replace his main negotiator at the talks mediated by Egypt on a lasting truce with Hamas in Gaza , officials say .
Amos Gilad criticised Mr Olmert last week for what he called an inconsistent approach to the talks , which he described as insulting to the Egyptians .
' War crimes '
Donatella Rovera , the head of an Amnesty fact - finding mission to southern Israel and Gaza , said : " Israeli forces used white phosphorus and other weapons supplied by the USA to carry out serious violations of international humanitarian law , including war crimes .
" Their attacks resulted in the death of hundreds of children and other civilians and massive destruction of homes and infrastructure .
" At the same time , Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups fired hundreds of rockets that had been smuggled in or made of components from abroad at civilian areas in Israel .
" Though far less lethal than the weaponry used by Israel , such rocket firing also constitutes a war crime and caused several civilian deaths . "

The report said fragments and components of artillery , tank shells , fins from mortar rounds and aircraft - launched missiles and bombs were found in school playgrounds , hospitals and homes in Gaza .
Israel 's weaponry predominantly came from the US , the report said .
About 1,300 Gazans and 13 Israelis died in 22 days of fighting last month .
The banking plan will involve a close review of financial institutions , possibly including a so - called stress test to measure whether they have enough resources to weather a continued economic decline .
It will also enable the government , when it provides a new round of investment , to convert the warrants for preferred stock it has already received from many institutions into common stock .
The move , which essentially would swap debt for equity , would help relieve the balance sheets of those institutions , although it would also hurt other existing shareholders by diluting their common stock .
Lawmakers said they were told that Mr. Geithner would not spell out the details of much of the program next week , including how the government would use more than $ 50 billion from that program to help homeowners facing foreclosure .
For weeks , administration officials have been exploring several alternatives for reducing the wave of foreclosures .
One proposal involves Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , the mortgage finance companies now under government control , to help further stabilize the housing markets by providing guarantees on low - rate mortgages .
Another proposal , said to be favored by Lawrence H. Summers , the senior White House economic official , would provide incentives to entice investors in pools of mortgages — and the companies that service mortgages — to refinance troubled home loans .
An announcement on that part of the plan is expected to be made by President Obama , lawmakers said , possibly as early as next week .
Although critics have blamed the administration of George W. Bush for mismanaging the TARP fund by not pressing the banks receiving assistance to increase their lending , the new round of capital injections is not expected to come with government demands that the institutions provide more loans .
But the new administration was expected to take other steps to encourage institutions to increase their lending , as well as to explain how much their lending had increased or decreased each quarter .
Democratic lawmakers who have been given previews on aspects of the plan praised it .
“ The plan is very smart , ” said Senator Charles E. Schumer , Democrat of New York , who declined to provide details of his discussions about the plan with senior administration officials .
“ It avoids one - size - fits - all .
It will have an overarching effect on many institutions .
But it does n’t put all institutions in the same box . ”

A study released today finds that bisphenol A , a chemical widely used to make plastic and suspected of causing cancer , stays in the body much longer than previously thought .
The findings are significant because the longer the chemical lingers in the body , the greater chance it has of doing harm , scientists say .
Researchers from the University of Rochester in New York also say the chemical may get into the body from sources such as plastic water pipes or dust from carbonless paper and not only from food containers that leach the chemical when heated .
The study results , published today in Environmental Health Perspectives , have sparked a flurry of concern and renewed calls for regulation .
" The study reinforces the urgent need for stricter government oversight and regulation of this extremely toxic chemical , " said Janet Nudelman , director of program and policy at the Breast Cancer Fund , a health advocacy group .
" It adds to what we already know about BPA , a chemical so powerful that at extremely low levels - parts per billion or even parts per trillion - it can cross the placenta and alter the mammary gland of the developing fetus , increasing breast cancer risk later in life . "
BPA , used to make baby bottles , dental sealants , food storage containers and thousands of other household products , was found in 93 % of Americans tested .
The new study , conducted by Richard Stahlhut at the University of Rochester , used data on humans collected by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
Researchers looked at urine samples of 1,469 U.S. adults .
They compared the levels of BPA based on how long the subjects had fasted .
Risk disputed
The American Chemistry Council , which represents makers of BPA , maintains that the chemical is safe for all uses .
Steven Hentges , spokesman for the trade group , dismissed the study as inherently limited .
" The authors ' conclusions are , at best , speculation , " Hentges said .
" Low levels of BPA found in the data are not a risk to human health . "
BPA has been linked to spikes in breast cancer , diabetes and heart disease , even at very low levels .
It has also been found to interfere with chemotherapy in breast cancer patients .
The Journal Sentinel had 10 household products tested and found toxic levels of BPA leaching from all of them .
Canada declared BPA to be a toxin and banned its use in baby bottles last year .
In the United States , 14 states are considering similar action .
Federal regulators have been divided on the issue .
A group of scientists from the National Toxicology Program expressed some concern last year about the chemical for infants and children .
But the Food and Drug Administration has said BPA is safe for all use .
The newspaper found federal regulators favored industry - financed studies in their assessments .
Entire sections of the FDA 's assessment contained identical language to reports written on behalf of chemical - makers or others with a financial stake in BPA .
The FDA safety assessment relied on two studies , both paid for by chemical - makers , and ignored hundreds of independent studies that found the chemical to cause harm in laboratory animals .
The FDA 's own science advisory board has recommended that the FDA reconsider its ruling .
FDA administrators have promised to study the matter further but so far have stood by their assessment .
Stahlhut 's study is likely to reignite concerns about the chemical 's safety .
" This is bound to shake things up , " Stahlhut said .
" It is saying that our risk assessments are wrong .
Things we thought we knew are n't necessarily so . "
More exposure
The research indicates for the first time that people are either constantly being bombarded with bisphenol A from non -food sources , such as receipts and plastic water piping , or they are storing the chemical in fat cells , unable to get rid of it as quickly as scientists have believed .
" It provides evidence that we are being exposed to more BPA than we think - and that contaminated food and beverages may not even be the main source " of our BPA exposure , said Patricia Hunt , a professor at Washington State University who pioneered studies linking BPA to cancer .
" Scary , huh ? "
Scientists previously thought that BPA metabolized quickly , with half the concentration eliminated between four and six hours and all of it gone by 24 hours .
Instead , Stahlhut , Shanna Swan , also of Rochester , and Wade Welshons of the University of Missouri - Columbia found that the levels dropped but then leveled off after eight hours - and never disappeared .
" They hang in there like a London fog , " Stahlhut said .
NEW ORLEANS , Jan. 3 ( UPI ) --
The father of a missing New Orleans boy led investigators to his son's body Saturday and admitted killing the boy to avoid paying child support , police said .
Danny Platt , 22 , was questioned for hours after he claimed late Friday that 2 - year - old Ja'Shawn Powell had been kidnapped , The ( New Orleans ) Times - Picayune reported .
At a news conference , police said Platt confessed Saturday afternoon he had killed his son .

The body was found near an overgrown playground behind a house .
Daniella Powell , Ja'Shawn 's mother , told WWL - TV in an interview Saturday that Platt owed $ 4,000 in back child support and had been ordered in early December to pay the arrears .
She said Powell took the boy for a visit Friday and then called her to say he had been kidnapped .
Platt first claimed that a white woman had grabbed Ja'Shawn from his arms , Powell said .
She said he later claimed the boy was kidnapped at gunpoint by three black men armed with AK - 47s .
WASHINGTON Hugo Chavezs victory in Sundays constitutional referendum in Venezuela will allow him to run for re-election indefinitely , but it does not mean he will be able to establish a totalitarian state anytime soon .
A decade after coming to power , Chavez commands strong support despite high inflation , food shortages , rampant crime and the toxic atmosphere stemming from his thuggish practices .
As with many populists before him from Brazils Getulio Vargas in the 1930s , Argentinas Juan Peron in the 1940s and 50s , Mexicos Luis Echeverria in the 1970s and Perus Alan Garcia in the 1980s this support is based in part on a cultural disposition that trumps economic results or moral considerations in many peoples minds .
Even though the opposition was not able to defeat Chavez this time , the referendum confirmed that he still faces millions of Venezuelans who abhor his regime .
The opposition obtained 45.6 percent of the vote9 percentage points more than in 2006 , when Chavez won his third term .
The no vote won in five key states and got more than 40 percent in nine others .
He was only able to win in one of the five states governed by the opposition and lost the state of Merida , governed by a Chavista .
If in next years legislative elections the opposition obtains similar results , it will control almost half of the National Assembly a big shift with respect to the current situation , with Chavez in total control because the opposition boycotted legislative elections in 2005 .
Perhaps more significantly , the results confirm that Chavezs base in the major urban centers , where Venezuelas biggest slums are concentrated , has been seriously eroded :
His power is increasingly reliant on the more rural or provincial parts of the country .
The symbolism of Chavezs defeat in Petare , a major slum in Caracas , cannot be overstated .
The penetration by the opposition into Chavezs former base has much to do with inflation and food shortages , a social drama that I witnessed a few months ago during an extensive visit to Caracas poorest quarters .
In the current world recession , things are likely to get worse .
Like most Latin American countries of late , Venezuela has been able to reduce poverty temporarily , at least through the redistribution of revenues generated by the export of commodities .
According to a recent study by the Center for Economic and Policy Research , poverty in Venezuela has been reduced over 10 years from 43 percent to 26 percent of the population .
The fact that Chavez is now encountering resistance in so many of Venezuelas slums implies that redistribution has reached its electoral limits .
It can no longer conceal the many social ills affecting ordinary Venezuelans , including a crime rate that is already higher than that of drug - ravaged Colombia .
In order to meet its import bill , Venezuela needs the price of its crude oil to be above $ 45 a barrel .
But to maintain his vast system of patronage and subsidies , Chavez needs the price to be even higher at least $ 85 a barrel .
That the government has decided to take $ 12 billion from its reserves to make up for the fall in revenue is further evidence that the collapse in oil prices is a direct threat to Chavezs model a model that fits the classic definition of populism as expressed by a former Panamanian president :
 If you hire your niece , it s called nepotism ; if you hire somebody elses niece , its called solidarity . 
Sundays referendum was marked by irregularities in at least 20 percent of the precincts , according to the well - respected Sumate monitoring organization .
During the run-up , the government controlled 85 percent of TV airtime and unleashed violent mobs to intimidate the opposition .
But one thing is certain :
While the opposition does not command enough support to overcome Chavezs juggernaut , the Venezuelan president still does not command enough power to achieve his totalitarian dream .
Lest Chavezs opponents succumb to melancholy in the face of the setback , they should take heart in this : Millions of Cubans would probably trade their current tyranny for Venezuela , which , Chavezs relentless efforts notwithstanding , is still far from being a second Cuba .
And that is the exclusive merit of his valiant foes .

Troubled by the Bear Stearns debacle , former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan is advocating a new way of dealing with government bailouts of companies whose sudden collapse could wreak havoc on the country 's economic and financial stability .
Greenspan says Congress needs to give the government new powers to handle troubled companies to minimize any potential losses to American taxpayers .
A self - described libertarian Republican , Greenspan has a reputation for being wary of giving the government extra powers .
However , in crisis situations , there needs to be a clear process for handling bailouts , rather than depending on the Fed to do so , he reckons .
A high - level panel of financial officials should be given broad authority to quickly determine whether a failing company poses a sufficient threat to the entire U.S. economy , he recommends .
If so , the company would be shut down .
" We need laws that specify and limit the conditions for bailouts -- laws that authorize the Treasury to use taxpayer money to counter systemic financial breakdowns transparently and directly rather than circuitously through the central bank as was done during the blowup of Bear Stearns , " Greenspan wrote in a new epilogue to the paperback edition of his memoir , " The Age of Turbulence : Adventures in a New World . "
( The paperback will be released Sept. 9 ; the hardcover came out last year . )
Greenspan envisions the formation of a group akin to the Resolution Trust Corp. ( RTC ) to step in , take a troubled company into conservatorship , wipe out the equity , impose some charge or " haircut " on its debts before guaranteeing them and then selling its assets .
The RTC was created in 1989 to deal with the aftermath of the savings and loan crisis .
It disposed of the assets of failed savings and loans and then went out of business .
Costs to taxpayers would still be a concern , he acknowledges .
As with the RTC , however , the public cost could be minimized , he says .
Moral Hazard
Critics in Congress , in academia and elsewhere worry that the Fed 's unprecedented actions -- including financial backing in March for JPMorgan 's takeover of Bear Stearns -- are putting taxpayers on the hook for billions of dollars of potential losses .
They also say it encourages " moral hazard , " that is , allowing financial companies to gamble more recklessly in the future .
Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke , who took the helm after Greenspan , has repeatedly defended the Fed 's actions , saying they were necessary to avert a meltdown of the entire financial system , which would have devastated the U.S. economy .
Bernanke 's
Fed also has taken a number of unconventional -- and some controversial -- actions to shore up the shaky financial system and to get credit , the economy 's lifeblood , flowing more freely .
It agreed in March to let investment houses draw emergency loans directly from the central bank .
And , in July , the Fed said Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac also could tap the program .
For years , such lending privileges were extended only to commercial banks , which are subject to stricter regulatory supervision .
Greenspan , 82 , who ran the Fed for 18 1/ 2 years and was the second - longest serving chief , says he is concerned that Capitol Hill will look to the Fed 's actions " as a wondrous new font of seemingly costless federal funding -- a magical piggy bank . "
The United States has long " abandoned the notion that we should leave crises to be resolved solely by the marketplace , " Greenspan says in making the case for new powers in this area .

Nothing so enriches the vocabulary , so instructs about English grammar and syntax , so creates a discipline of the mind , an elegance of expression , and serves as a gateway to the thinking and values of Western civilization as mastery of a page of Virgil or Livy ( except perhaps Sophocles 's Antigone in Greek or Thucydides ' dialogue at Melos ) .
After some 20 years of teaching mostly minority youth Greek , Latin , and ancient history and literature in translation ( 1984-2004 ) , I came to the unfortunate conclusion that ethnic studies , women studies -- indeed , anything " studies " -- were perhaps the fruits of some evil plot dreamed up by illiberal white separatists to ensure that poor minority students in the public schools and universities were offered only a third - rate education .
2. Hollywood is going the way of Detroit .
The actors are programmed and pretty rather than interesting looking and unique .
They , of course , are overpaid ( they do to films what Lehman Brothers ' execs did to stocks ) , mediocre , and politicized .
The producers and directors are rarely talented , mostly unoriginal -- and likewise politicized .
A pack - mentality rules .
Do one movie on a comic superhero -- and suddenly we get ten , all worse than the first .
One noble lion cartoon movie earns us eagle , penguin and most of Noah 's Arc sequels .
Now see poorer remakes of movies that were never good to begin with .
I doubt we will ever see again a Western like Shane , the Searchers , High Noon , or the Wild Bunch .
If one wishes to see a fine film , they are now usually foreign , such as Das Boot or Breaker Morant .
Watching any recent war movie ( e.g. , Iraq as the Rape of Nanking ) is as if someone put uniforms on student protestors and told them to consult their professors for the impromptu script .
3 . All the old media brands of our youth have been tarnished and all but discredited .
No one picks up Harpers or Atlantic expecting to read a disinterested story on politics or culture .
( I pass on their inane accounts of ' getaways ' and food . )
The New York Times and Washington Post are as likely to have op - eds as news stories on the front page .
Newsweek and Time became organs for paint - by - numbers Obamism , teased with People Magazine - like gossip pieces ( at least , their editors still cared enough to seem hurt when charged with overt bias ) .
NBC , ABC , and CBS would now make a Chet Huntley or Eric Sevareid turn over in his grave .
A Keith Olbermann would not have been allowed to do commercials in the 1950s .
Strangely , the media has offered up fashionably liberal politics coupled with metrosexual elite tastes in fashions , clothes , housing , food , and the good life , as if there were no contradictions between the two .
No wonder media is so enthralled with the cool Obama and his wife .
Both embody the new nexus between Eurosocialism in the abstract and the hip aristocratic life in the concrete .
4 . After the junk bond meltdown , the S&L debacle , and now the financial panic , in just a few years the financial community destroyed the ancient wisdom : deal in personal trust ; your word is your bond ; avoid extremes ; treat the money you invest for others as something sacred ; do n't take any more perks than you would wish others to take ; do n't borrow what you could n't suddenly pay back ; imagine the worse case financial scenario and expect it very may well happen ; the wealthier you become the more humble you should act .
And for what did our new Jay Goulds do all this ?
A 20,000 square - foot mansion instead of the old 6,000 sq. ft. expansive house ?
A Gulfstream in lieu of first class commercial ?
You milk your company , cash in your stock bonuses , enjoy your $ 50 million cash pile , and then get what --a Rolex instead of a reliable Timex ?
A Maserati for a Mercedes , a gold bathroom spout in preference to brushed pewter ?
The extra splurge was marginal and hardly worth the stain of avarice on one 's immortal soul .
5. California is now a valuable touchstone to the country , a warning of what not to do .
Rarely has a single generation inherited so much natural wealth and bounty from the investment and hard work of those more noble now resting in our cemeteries -- and squandered that gift within a generation .
Compare the vast gulf from old Governor Pat Brown to Gray Davis or Arnold Schwarzenegger .
We did not invest in many dams , canals , rails , and airports ( though we use them all to excess ) ; we sued each other rather than planned ; wrote impact statements rather than left behind infrastructure ; we redistributed , indulged , blamed , and so managed all at once to create a state with about the highest income and sales taxes and the worst schools , roads , hospitals , and airports .
A walk through downtown San Francisco , a stroll up the Fresno downtown mall , a drive along highway 101 ( yes , in many places it is still a four - lane , pot - holed highway ) , an afternoon at LAX , a glance at the catalogue of Cal State Monterey , a visit to the park in Parlier - - all that would make our forefathers weep .
We can't build a new nuclear plant ; can't drill a new offshore oil well ; can't build an all - weather road across the Sierra ; can't build a few tracts of new affordable houses in the Bay Area ; can't build a dam for a water - short state ; and can't create even a mediocre passenger rail system .
Everything else - - well , we do that well .
6. Something has happened to the generic American male accent .
Maybe it is urbanization ; perhaps it is now an affectation to sound precise and caring with a patina of intellectual authority ; perhaps it is the fashion culture of the metrosexual ; maybe it is the influence of the gay community in arts and popular culture .
Maybe the ubiquitous new intonation comes from the scarcity of salty old jobs in construction , farming , or fishing .
But increasingly to meet a young American male about 25 is to hear a particular nasal stress , a much higher tone than one heard 40 years ago , and , to be frank , to listen to a precious voice often nearly indistinguishable from the female .
How indeed could one make Westerns these days , when there simply is not anyone left who sounds like John Wayne , Richard Boone , Robert Duvall , or Gary Cooper much less a Struther Martin , Jack Palance , L.Q. Jones , or Ben Johnson ?
I watched the movie Twelve O'clock High the other day , and Gregory Peck and Dean Jagger sounded liked they were from another planet .
I confess over the last year , I have been interviewed a half - dozen times on the phone , and had no idea at first whether a male or female was asking the questions .
All this sounds absurd , but I think upon reflection readers my age ( 55 ) will attest they have had the same experience .
In the old days , I remember only that I first heard a variant of this accent with the old Paul Lynde character actor in one of the Flubber movies ; now young men sound closer to his camp than to a Jack Palance or Alan Ladd .
7 . We have given political eccentricity a bad name .
There used to be all sorts of classy individualists , liberal and conservative alike , like Everett Dirksen , J. William Fulbright , Margaret Chase Smith , or Sam Ervin ; today we simply see the obnoxious who claim to be eccentric like a Barbara Boxer , Al Franken , Barney Frank , or Harry Reid .
The loss is detectable even in diction and manner ; Dirksen was no angel , but he was witty , charming , insightful ; Frank is no angel , but he merely rants and pontificates .
Watch the You Tube exchange between Harvard Law Graduate Frank and Harvard Law Graduate Rains as they arrogantly dismiss their trillion - dollar Fannie / Freddie meltdown in the making .
I suppose it is the difference between the Age of Belief and the Age of Nihilism .
8 . Do not farm .
There is only loss .
To the degree that anyone makes money farming , it is a question of a vertically - integrated enterprise making more in shipping , marketing , selling , packing , and brokering than it loses on the other end in growing .
No exceptions .
Food prices stay high , commodity prices stay low .
That is all ye need to know .
Try it and see .
9 . As I wrote earlier , the shrill Left is increasingly far more vicious these days than the conservative fringe , and about like the crude Right of the 1950s .
Why ?
I am not exactly sure , other than the generic notion that utopians often believe that their anointed ends justify brutal means .
Maybe it is that the Right already had its Reformation when Buckley and others purged the extremists -- the Birchers , the neo-Confederates , racialists , the fluoride - in - the - water conspiracists , anti-Semites , and assorted nuts .-- from the conservative ranks in a way the Left has never done with the 1960s radicals that now reappear in the form of Michael Moore , Bill Ayers , Cindy Sheehan , Moveon.org , the Daily Kos , etc .
Not many Democrats excommunicated Moveon.org for its General Betray - Us ad .
Most lined up to see the premier of Moore 's mythodrama .
Barack Obama could subsidize a Rev. Wright or email a post - 9/11 Bill Ayers in a way no conservative would even dare speak to a David Duke or Timothy McVeigh - - and what Wright said was not all that different from what Duke spouts .
What separated Ayers from McVeigh was chance ; had the stars aligned , the Weathermen would have killed hundreds as they planned .
10 .
The K - 12 public education system is essentially wrecked .
No longer can any professor expect an incoming college freshman to know what Okinawa , John Quincy Adams , Shiloh , the Parthenon , the Reformation , John Locke , the Second Amendment , or the Pythagorean Theorem is .
An entire American culture , the West itself , its ideas and experiences , have simply vanished on the altar of therapy .
This upcoming generation knows instead not to judge anyone by absolute standards ( but not why so ) ; to remember to say that its own Western culture is no different from , or indeed far worse than , the alternatives ; that race , class , and gender are , well , important in some vague sense ; that global warming is manmade and very soon will kill us all ; that we must have hope and change of some undefined sort ; that AIDs is no more a homosexual - than a heterosexual - prone disease ; and that the following things and people for some reason must be bad , or at least must in public company be said to be bad ( in no particular order ) : Wal - Mart , cowboys , the Vietnam War , oil companies , coal plants , nuclear power , George Bush , chemicals , leather , guns , states like Utah and Kansas , Sarah Palin , vans and SUVs .
Well , with that done -- I feel much better .

I freely admit I did not author this image , but the idea someone would go through this much trouble to complain of an image easily made with your favorite paint tool strikes me as odd .
Also , in response to a comment on reddit about how it ’s not about “ praying for an A on the test , but praying for the strength to study hard so you get an A on the test . ”
Why do you need strength ?
Why not the patience ?
Why not the attention span ?
Why not the adderall ?
Seriously , if you want to study , prayer wo n’t make a bit of difference , the difference lies in the determination to study and do well .
The ritual may give you that little bit of comfort , but nothing more .
[ CES 2009 ] WowWee ’s Roborover is part of its Robotics line , and is operated through a remote control with poseable arms , head and waist for that added touch of humanity ( ironic , is n’t it ? ) .
This talking robot comes with some spoken content , a bunch of driving - based games to keep you entertained , infrared sensors so that he wo n’t bump into obstacles and fall over as well as tilt sensors that lets him know he has fallen over in order to get back up after dusting his knees .
Other features of the Roborover include a “ Follow Me ” homing function that makes him all the more adorable – it kickstarts his exploratory nature by searching out for his user regardless of whether it is night or day .
Should it get too dark , the Roborover will turn on its sensor - based LED headlights to aid in his movement .

The sugar - dealing - diabetes - causing - drug - dealers at Kellogs are feeling the heat from firing Michael Phelps .
It appears now that they are getting a little uncomfortable with how their product is being viewed .
Here ’s the thing with these megacorporations , they do n’t care about Michael Phelps .
They want Michael Phelps to go away , they do n’t give a fuck if someone is smoking weed or is a bad example for children , all they care about is their money .
When they thought it was in their best interest financially they fired Phelps , now they see that it ’s not .
So their position now will most likely be one of silence ( notice that they refused to make a comment to the Lou Dobbs ) , and hope the whole thing blows over .
Just remember , next time you get the munchies DONT BUY ANYTHING FROM KELLOGS ! 🙂

Many of us in this high - paced world are either too busy or just plain unable to decide whether they are tired or whether they are depressed .
How is one to know ?
After all , the symptoms are so similar .
If you choose tired when you are really depressed , you may never write that next great number one teenage angst song .
But if you choose depressed when you ’re just tired , you may end up in the psych ward and who wants that ?
So here are a few guidelines to follow so you ’ll know whether you ’re in need of rest or whether you ’re in need of prescribed pharmaceuticals : * If you fall asleep while watching TV you are tired .
* If you fall asleep while eating you are depressed .
* If you fall asleep on the couch during the day it is called taking a refreshing nap .
* If you crawl into bed during the day it is called severe mental anguish .
* If you do n’t want to get out of bed because it ’s winter and your bed is just too damn cozy then that ’s just common sense .
* If you do n’t want get out of bed in the summer then that means you are completely mental .
If you take a nap for three hours straight that is depression .
* But if you take a three hour nap due to an exhausting all - night drinking binge the night before that is being tired ( the heavy drinking , though , is probably depression ) .
* If you are laughing hysterically for no apparent reason , that means you are probably punchy and a little overtired .
* If you are laughing hysterically because you are watching “ Two and a Half Men ” , then you are horribly , horribly depressed .
* If you are cranky all day because of a bad night ’s sleep then you are tired .
*
If you are cranky because your bad night ’s sleep was due to you obsessing over Ryan Seacrest , then you are depressed – and possibly bipolar .
* If you fall asleep in your cubicle at work , then you are just tired .
* If you fall asleep at your cubicle and your boss busts you , then you sure as shit better tell him you are depressed before he fires your ass .
* If you fall asleep from going down on your girlfriend all night long , that is being tired .
* While you are going down on your girlfriend , if you look up and see she is asleep , that is depression … … for the both of you .
Question :
What do you think of Maria ?
My Reply : She ’s a nice girl .
Wow , at first glance it looks like I said something !
But , I did n’t .
I used a word , in this instance the word “ nice , ” that has taken on so many meanings it no longer means anything in particular .
“ Nice ” by today ’s standards can mean anything from a “ fat slut ball with a wide vagina ” to a “ cum guzzling starlet . ”
The circumstance for this method is obvious : when I ’m referring to someone ’s mother .
With Valentine 's
Day around the corner , your thoughts are probably starting to turn to the sort of sexy outfits you can ask your other half to dress up in .
You might even be turning to the movies for inspiration .
Well , whatever you do , do n't look to this lot for ideas .
The future of the human race depends on it .
Whose outfit is it ?
Sybil Danning 's from Battle Beyond The Stars ( 1980 )
Why is it uncomfortable ?
We 're not sure what this one 's made of .
It appears to be cheap plastic , but it 's probably meant to be alien crystal or whatever .
Either way , it looks about as easy to wear as a t - shirt that says ' I Hate Rednecks ' at a wrestling convention .
Why should n't I ask my girlfriend to wear it on Saturday ?
Because she 'll look at it , look at you , look at it , look at you , look at it ... then kick you straight on the shin .
Hard .
[ page - break ]
Whose outfit is it ?
Angelina Jolie 's from Mr % 26 Mrs Smith
Why is it uncomfortable ?
This latex number might not be uncomfortable on the right girl , but Angelina wears it with about as much sexual pleasure as a toilet cleaner wears gloves .
That is n't a seductive look on her face .
That 's a grimace .
Why should n't I ask my girlfriend to wear it on Saturday ?
Again , on the right girl , this little number would look great .
But if your other half is n't into S%26 M , this probably is n't the most romantic outfit to pull out from behind your back on February 14th .
Whose outfit is it ?
Milla Jovovich 's from The Fifth Element ( 1997 )
Why is it uncomfortable ?
Not so much an outfit as what you 'd find at the bottom of a doctor 's cupboard , we 're hoping the set was n't drafty the days Milla shot her bandage scenes .
Why should n't I ask my girlfriend to wear it on Saturday ?
Not only is it ridiculous , it was designed by Jean Paul Gautier , which means it 'll be super pricey .
[ page - break ]
Whose outfit is it ?
Natalie Portman 's from Star Wars Episode I
Why is it uncomfortable ?
It 's fine , as long as you do n't want your girlfriend to move .
For any reason .
If she turns her head too fast she 'll break her neck under the weight of that hairdo faster than you can say Jar - Jar Binks .
Why should n't I ask my girlfriend to wear it on Saturday ?
She probably takes long enough to do her hair as it is .
Whose outfit is it ?
Natalie Portman 's from Closer
Why is it uncomfortable ?
Like Angelina 's Smith outfit , this is more about the gal wearing it than the outfit itself .
Portman makes the most awkward stripper since Elizabeth Berkley decided to become a Showgirl .
With another major downside ; she does n't actually strip .
Why should n't I ask my girlfriend to wear it on Saturday ?
Because we imagine you 'll want her to undress at some point .
If she sticks too close to the Portman template , she 'll never take it off .
Not when you 're looking , anyway .
[ page - break ]
Whose outfit is it ?
Dr Manhattan 's from Watchmen ( 2009 )
Why is it uncomfortable ?
Depends on how confident your girlfriend is about walking around in the buff , we suppose .
Whilst painted blue .
Why should n't I ask my girlfriend to wear it on Saturday ?
That all depends on how you feel about Smurfette .
We 've encountered worse fetishes .
Whose outfit is it ?
Sean Connery 's from Zardoz
Why is it uncomfortable ?
Look at it .
Just look at it .
Why should n't I ask my girlfriend to wear it on Saturday ?
Because you 'll be so overcome by its sexual potency , you 'll never leave the house again .

When the Web Applications Group and the Distributed Applications Group were merged into one , it should have been a joyous day for Greg Beech .
After all , Greg would finally get the chance to see first hand the " Enterprise CMS " system that the Distributed group had been bragging about for so many years .
It was built by a team of elite consultants and billed " the quintessential collection of best practices . "
After downloading the source code , following the seventy - two steps required to install the Enterprise CMS on a development workstation , and spending an entire afternoon fiddling around with his computer 's settings , Greg finally had the software running .
But when he fired it up in up in debug mode through Visual Studio , he noticed something strange : a preposterous number of exceptions were being thrown , many of which were of type DivideByZeroException .
Many of the more enterprisey exceptions – such as DomainContextCertificateException – were to be expected , as he was only running the code locally .
But the myriad DivideByZeroExceptions just did n’t make sense .
After digging through layer after layer of “ best practices code ” , Greg finally discovered the source : a “ best practice ” that was prevalently used throughout countless stored procedures .
Such as this one .
CREATE PROCEDURE members_getMember ( @ Member
Id int , @ FetchBlocked Member bit , @ FetchInactiveMember bit ...snip ... ) AS BEGIN ... snip ...
DECLARE @ActDivisor int , @BlockDivisor int SET @ActDivisor = ISNULL( @FetchInactiveMember,0 ) SET @BlockDivisor = ISNULL( @FetchBlockedMember,0 ) SELECT M.
MemberId , FirstName , LastName , MemberStatus , PrivacyFlags , ApprovalStatus , Gender , TimeZone , PostalCode , PostalCodeExtra , M.CountryCode , EmailRecipientId , City , State , Latitude , Longitude , Active , Birthdate , RegisterDate , M.CreateDate , M.PreferredCultureName , CodeName , NamespaceId FROM Member M INNER JOIN MemberSourceCode S ON S.SourceCode
Id = M.SourceCodeId LEFT JOIN PostalCode Z on M.PostalCode
Id = Z.PostalCode
Id and M.CountryCode = Z.CountryCode WHERE M.MemberId = @ MemberId -- this causes errors for non-active members when you did n''t ask for them .
AND ( Active = 1 OR 1/( Active+@ActDivisor ) IS NULL ) -- this causes errors for blocked members when you did n''t ask for them .
AND ( ISNULL ( ApprovalStatus,1 ) = 1 OR 1/( ISNULL ( ApprovalStatus,1)+@BlockDivisor ) >
0 ) ... snip ...
END
Greg explains ...
" You 'll notice that the procedure takes parameters to indicate whether to retrieve active or blocked members .
Now you or I might select the member details , check whether they are active or blocked , and then either return zero rows or raise an appropriate error using RAISERROR .
" The consultants , however , found a more innovative approach .
Taking advantage of the fact that the BIT data type is not a true Boolean but is in fact the values 1 or 0 , they add the value of the active / blocked flags to the parameter values and then divide by it , causing a ' divide by zero exception ' if both the parameter and the flag are false .
Innovative , indeed .
The new Kindle looks great : Simple , functional , and pretty .
It looks like Amazon got a few clues from Apple and Braun 's design guidelines .
But does it comply with Dieter Rams ' 10 rules for good design ?
Advertisement
Dieter Rams is the design guru who was responsible for some of the most amazing product designs of the 20th century , while he was working at Braun .
He and his 10 rules of good design are one of the biggest influences of Jon Ive , the head of design at Apple .
Here are the 10 rules :
Good design is innovative .
It 's hardly to be innovative when your product is an evolution of a previous generation .
The first Kindle , though aesthetically horrible , was innovative .
The new Kindle 2 does n't introduce anything new from the previous generation or similar products .
Advertisement
Fail .
Good design makes a product useful .
The new keys , both the round ones on the keyboard and the one on the sides , seem a lot better than the old ones .
I would have preferred a full touch interface , since text input is not that important and it would simplify the interface to the minimum expression :
A simple white , thin slate with a screen .
However , I imagine there are price and screen - readability constrains that make this impossible .
Pass .
Good design is aesthetic .
The simple white , the position of the keys , the aluminum back , the thinness ... maybe you think the new Kindle looks great because the old one looked like crap , but the Kubrick 's 2001 'ish design is pretty on its own .
Advertisement
Pass .
Good design helps us to understand a product .
The new Kindle is easy to understand .
Anyone would be able to figure it out by just holding in their hands .
Not as easy as figuring out how to read a real book , but good enough for a piece of electronics .
Advertisement
Pass .
Good design is unobtrusive .
It also passes this test .
The screen , which holds the object of interest , is the centerpiece , the focus of the product .
The design does n't get in the way of its objective , to let you read .
Still it 's not as unobtrusive as a paper book , but as good as it can get this side of a pure touchscreen product .
Advertisement
We still have to try the new 5 - way controller , however , and see how it lives up to the claim of enabling precise navigation and text selection .
With the scroll wheel gone , a touch or pen interface would have been the more natural way to perform these functions .
Pass .
Good design is honest .
No thrills , no frills , no artificial ornaments .
This product comes naked , as it is , as honest as it can get .
Advertisement
Pass .
Good design is durable .
Looking at our hands on , the drop test at Amazon 's product page , and the previous generation , it looks like the new Kindle is a solid product .
Actually , that aluminum back makes it look like it is even more solid .
Advertisement
Pass .
Good design is consequent to the last detail .
Its coherence is clear in the whole hardware design , although we have n't seen many of the other details yet , like the accessories and the packaging .
Advertisement
Pass ( pending the final hands on . )
Good design is concerned with the environment .
Although we have n't found any information about the materials used in the Kindle and its packaging , this has to be one of the greenest products there is .
Whatever they use for making them , it 's outweighed by the savings on trees , chemicals , and water used in the production of real books , printed on both new and recycled paper .
Advertisement
Pass .
Good design is as little design as possible .
Again , the design of the Kindle 2.0 is as minimalist as it can get working against the limitations of not having a touchscreen .
Advertisement
Pass .
While it does n't pass all the rules , overall the new Kindle 's design is a success .
It looks good , it 's as simple as it can get with the current technology - price limitations , and it just works .
Ever feel like yawning to impress a date ?
Or falling asleep while balancing on your heels ?
What about sleeping with one eye open ?
All animals sleep , but not always in the ways you 'd imagine .
Dolphins , Ducks and unilateral eye closure Dolphins and ducks both keep one eye open and one half of the brain awake at all times .
This is called unilateral eye closure ( UEC ) and most birds as well as some other large sea mammals can do it .
This unusual sleeping technique allows these animals to stay alert to predators .
Dolphins are particularly unusual in their lack of need for sleep ; a calf and its mother will have ZERO sleep for the first few months of the baby 's life .
Migratory Thrush Nappers
While migrating , Swainson 's thrushes take hundreds of naps during the day , each of just a few seconds .
Migratory birds tend to function well on ' micro- naps ' and there is strong evidence to suggest that some species can sleep while flying .
The albatross is probably the strongest contender for this impressive feat .
They spend all of their time at sea and would be very open to attack if they slept while floating on water , so there 's little other way they could grab a bit of shut eye .
Birds that roost in groups will usually have a ring of ' sentries ' that keep one eye open while the rest of the group sleeps soundly .
Mallards observed sleeping in a line will often post sentries on either end of the group , allowing those in the middle to sleep more soundly .
I wonder if his other eye is actually wide open ...
Talon -ted Sleepers
Bats sleep upside down .
Sounds daft , right ?
Well , have a look at some of the reasons why they do it and an inverted snooze might begin to sound a lot more attractive : - bats ' wings are n't really strong enough to launch them into the air from the ground ; hanging from the roof means they can just drop into flight .
- because of the unique design of their talons , bats use very little energy while hanging .
The talons lock into place and the force of gravity does the rest .
- there is no other competition for roosting spots .
- gravity is a fast accelerator , so bats can simply ' drop ' out of trouble should the need arise .
Frogs Frozen Hibernation Lots of animals hibernate .
This is different from sleep and a hibernating animal can often take days to wake up properly .
In hibernation , an animal 's heartbeat will slow down dramatically and its temperature will drop close to whatever the outside temperature is .
Hibernation is sleeping through cold and estivation is sleeping through heat .
Frogs are some of the best hibernators around .
Some species can survive being frozen solid with no heart beat or breathing for weeks at a time !
It 's Not Yawning , It 's An Ecstatic Display Most animals yawn , but it 's probably not because they 're bored or sleepy .
Scientists are still on the case as to why , but there are lots of different theories .
Baboons have been observed yawning to threaten their enemies .
Similarly , Siamese Fighting
Fish yawn only when they see another fighting fish ( or their own mirror - image ) and will often attack aggressively .
Penguins yawn while courting - it 's known as an ' ecstatic display ' .
Snakes meanwhile , usually yawn to realign their jaws after a meal .
The Deep - Sleeping But Deeply Stupid Duck - Billed Platypus
If you feel shortchanged in the sleep department , thank goodness you 're not a giraffe - they only sleep for about 2 hours out of every 24 .
The brown bat is at the other end of the spectrum and usually sleeps for 19 hours a day .
Scientists seem to be in agreement that the larger you are , the less sleep you need .
However , a more disputed theory argues that long periods of REM increase intelligence .
This is mostly true in mammals , but for the exception of the deep - sleeping but deeply stupid duck - billed platypus .
Another theory that makes more sense is that the amount of REM sleep an animal gets is related to its safety in its environment ....
Ninja Style Sleeping Defenses
The more dangerous life an animal leads , the less likely it is to sleep deeply .
According to the Sleep Foundation , a particular kind of baboon sleeps on its heels on top of a tree .
This helps it stay alert while asleep .
Similarly , the golden dormouse can spend a lot of time sleeping by carefully balancing itself on the branch of a tree safe in the knowledge that any quiver of the twig will wake it up immediately .

Chris Matthews : Howard Dean should replace Daschle David Edwards and Joe Byrne
Published : Wednesday February 4 , 2009
Print This Email This Chris Matthews interviewed Senator Claire McCaskill last night on MSNBC's Hardball about the president 's nomination for the Secretary of Human and Health Services .
After talking about Tom Daschle for a moment -  the rules are , you live in a glass house ,  McCaskill remarked about Daschle 's notoriety - Matthews turned the conversation to Howard Dean .
 How come he 's not the HHS secretary ?
He 's getting squat from the president . 
Matthews listed the reasons why Dean would be perfect as a member of Obama 's cabinet :  Howard Dean is the chairman of the Democratic party ... he had a big hand in bringing this victory that you all enjoy this year , he 's a medical doctor , he succeeds in so many ways in building your party up and raising money and doing everything right , he began this populist thing back in the last election ... he's getting nothing ! 
Senator McCaskill responded by saying ,  I do n't know that he wants anything , Chris . 
Before Daschle 's nomination had been announced , bloggers had seen Howard Dean as a very real possibility .
Chris Frates and Cecile Dehesdin of Politico pointed out that Dean is a high - profile bomb - thrower  and would have trouble working with Republicans .
Daschle withdrew his nomination for Secretary of Health and Human Services yesterday due to revelations of tax fraud amounting to $ 140,000 .
Obama has not yet announced his replacement .
Now that the position is open again , political spectators are wondering who will be next .
 It sounds to me like he did n't get what he wanted ,  Matthews concluded his interview .

Correction : Due to a transcription error , Sen. McCaskill was misquoted in an earlier version of this article .
She said , " I do n't know that he wants anything , " not , " I do n't know that he was anything . "
With nearly 1.5 million people in the mid-west without power during a cold snap , what other possible reason is there that this new " competent " administration and FEMA would be failing so spectacularly in helping in this natural disaster ?
It 's got to be that Obama hates white people and wants them to die !
Of course , I am just aping what lefty blogs were saying about Bush less than 24 hours after Katrina 's hurricane winds stopped blowing .
But AP is reporting that Midwest disaster relief people are none too pleased with our new president 's FEMA .
In Kentucky 's Grayson County , there are 25 National Guardsmen there to help - but no chain saws to cut away fallen limbs and trees .
EM Director Randell Smith is quoted as saying , " We 've got people out in some areas we have n't even visited yet , " Smith said .
" We do n't even know that they 're alive . "
Smith is also quoted as saying that FEMA is a " no show . "
What 's that ?
Here we are 5 days after the storm ended and still no FEMA ?
I demand a Congressional investigation .
And let 's get all the anchors and media people down here pronto .
People 's lives are at stake .
For all we know , there are babies being eaten and people jumping off their roofs committing suicide because FEMA is nowhere to be found .
And where is our president ?
Should n't he be visiting these ravaged areas ?
It must be that he HATES WHITE PEOPLE AND WANTS THEM TO DIE .
That is the only possible explanation for this incredible failure of our national government to relieve the suffering of these people .
Is n't it interesting that now that we have a Democrat as president that all of a sudden , disaster relief is a state and local matter and the federal government should stand aside and allow them to do their jobs ?

Has George W. Bush been the most unacceptable President in U.S. History ?
COUNTERSPIN authors on FAIR.ORG has noted : " December 2008 marks not just the conclusion of another calendar year , but the end of eight years of the George W. Bush administration — an era notable for , among other things , particular predations on civil liberties , the free flow of information and the public 's right to know .
Other administrations have been wary of the press corps , to be sure .
But it was the Bush White House whose first attorney general instructed federal agencies to drag their feet on FOIA requests ; whose Defense Department orchestrated the pulling down of a statue of Saddam Hussein — supposedly by joyous Iraqis — as part of a disinformation campaign on the war .
Who pressured EPA officials to " clean up " public statements on air quality at Ground Zero after September 11 , 2001 .
Whatever one thinks of the incoming administration , it 's fair to say the departing one has left a very high hole to dig out of a number of fronts . "

Poverty rights activists broke into at least a dozen vacant Minneapolis buildings this week and helped homeless families move in .
“ This is the modern underground railroad , ” said Cheri Honkala , National Organizer for the Poor People ’s Economic Human Rights Campaign , the group organizing the “ takeovers . ”
This week ’s actions are part of a growing national movement to illegally open up thousands of vacant , foreclosed homes to provide housing for the growing number of homeless people .
Over 3,000 Minneapolis homes went into foreclosure in 2008 .
Advocates estimate that over 7,000 Minnesotans are homeless .
Most Twin Cities ’ homeless shelters have been filled to capacity for months .
On a recent afternoon , organizers planned their next takeover while eating cabbage , rice , sausage , and corn bread prepared by Rosemary , a 59 - year - old African American woman facing eviction from her home .
Rosemary , who asked that her last name not be used , plans to remain in her house illegally after the March 31 eviction date .
In the meantime , she spends her time organizing for tenant ’s rights .
“ Welcome to the revolution , ” Rosemary said , greeting a homeless couple looking for housing .
Lonnetta and Dwayne took a seat on Rosemary ’s couch .
Dwayne , 52 , walking on crutches from a series of recent foot surgeries , explained that he lost his janitorial job in June when he broke his foot .
The married couple asked that their last name not be used .
Forced to survive on Lonnetta ’s $ 637 a month Social Security check , the couple soon became homeless .
Social service providers told them to stay at Harbor Light , a homeless shelter in downtown Minneapolis , where the couple would be housed on different floors .
Lonnetta , 48 , feared being separated from her sick husband who she said needs frequent reminders to take his medication .
Instead , the couple started living out of their truck .
A relative put Lonnetta and Dwayne in contact with the Poor People ’s Economic Human Rights Campaign , a national anti-poverty organization based in Minneapolis .
Rosemary Williams and Cheri Honkala
Honkala , the group ’s National Organizer , became an activist in her teenage years when she and her young son lived in her car after becoming homeless .
When a drunk driver hit the car one night , Honkala said she got fed up , and moved into a vacant Minneapolis HUD property for several months .
After years of anti-poverty work , Honkala rose to national prominence in the 1990s by founding the Kensington Welfare Rights Union in an impoverished Philadelphia neighborhood .
The activist group helped move homeless families into vacant properties , and used the publicity from those occupations to force the city to issue housing vouchers .
Honkala moved back to Minneapolis two years ago and started matching homeless families with vacant buildings .
She estimates that about forty families have been housed since her return , including twelve this week .
Honkala met Dwayne and Lonnetta last week .
She offered to find them housing in a vacant home .
The couple readily agreed .
The plan turned out to be more difficult than the couple anticipated .
Activists first attempted to house the couple in a vacant South Minneapolis home .
A city inspector and the police soon arrived and demanded they leave .
The police issued trespassing citations to Lonnetta , Dwayne , Honkala , and Manuel Levinsholden , a 19 - year - old organizer .
Honkala said that a pro bono attorney will provide legal assistance .
Activists then led the couple to Rosemary ’s house , where they hoped to house the couple in one of the block ’s five vacant homes .
While chatting in Rosemary ’s living room , Honkala received a phone call .
“ Well , that ’s not going to work , ” she said .
“ Burglar alarms . ”
However , with no shortage of properties to choose from , it only took a few phone calls to find a new location several blocks away .
Within a few minutes , Honkala , Levinsholden , Lonnetta , and Dwayne were inside a large , empty yellow duplex .
Dining room in vacant house
Dwayne cautiously walked around broken glass on the kitchen floor and made his way into the dining room , surveying the hardwood floors and large windows .
“ I want it , ” he said .
“ Look at that bathroom , ” said Lonnetta , turning on what appeared to be a brand new light fixture .
“ That ’s pretty . ”
She then made her way into the living room , painted blue , but marked with dozens of white splotches to cover up graffiti .
When asked how the activists will get the heat and hot water turned on , Honkala grinned and said , “ God turns on the utilities . ”
Rosemary , who came by to inspect the couple ’s new home , stumbled while walking up the steep staircase to the second floor .
After dusting herself off , she looked around the upstairs kitchen : a row of old wooden cabinets and an empty space where a dishwasher might have been .
“ Not bad , ” she said .
Kitchen in vacant home
Meanwhile , Honkala grabbed several documents left on the downstairs kitchen counter , including paperwork stating that HUD owns the house .
One document indicated that the home was last inspected on February 3rd .
“ This is just a waste , ” she said .
“ It ’s a waste to have thousands of empty homes like this and people with no place to live . ”
Organizers plan to provide furniture and help the families with basic renovations .
Honkala said that the Poor People ’s Economic Human Rights Campaign will continue to house the homeless in vacant buildings until the government can provide a safe , affordable alternative .
More takeovers are planned for this weekend .
Meanwhile , Rosemary faces eviction in a few weeks , but has no plans to leave .
“ We ’ll pack my house with people , ” she said .
“ It ’ll be a showdown . ”
“ Wait , ” Dwayne said , looking surprised .
“ You ’re going to lose your home , too ? ” He shook his head .
“ No man , we ai n’t gonna let them do that , no way .
We ’re neighbors . ”

Britannica president Jorge Cauz is very displeased with the way Google has been displaying pages from Wikipedia on top of its SERPs .
Mr. Cauz even attacked Google ’s algorithm saying that for a top search engine such as Google , bringing Wikipedia as the first link in most of its SERPs undermines the capability of their search algorithm .
Interestingly , while Mr. Cauz was attacking Google and Wikipedia , he announced that Britannica online 2.0 is ready to roll out , and among its new features would allow users to edit , enhance , and contribute to the online encylopedia .
Interestingly , while Mr.Cauz was putting down Wikipedia for having “ plenty of cracks on it in terms of the quality ” , he however explains Britannica 2.0 ’s features as :
“ What we are trying to do is shifting … to a much more proactive role for the user and reader where the reader is not only going to learn from reading the article but by modifying the article and – importantly – by maybe creating his own content or her own content . ”
In other words , Britannica online is “ remodelling ” its online encyclopedia into something like Wikipedia with a slight difference , among which is the pre-approval of contents or edits by Britannica ’s staff or freelance editors before changes or contents are carried out on the Britannica online site .
Likewise , all changes that will be done in Britannica online will also be reflected in the printed version of the encyclopedia .
Those who are planning to contribute to Britannica 2.0 will need to register first on the site before they can make edits or upload their contents that will appear side - by - side those articles authored by Britannica ’s paid contributors .

The question now is whether Britannica 2.0 online could become as popular and as widely used as Wikipedia ?
For one thing , if Britannica does this right , students and researchers will most likely turn to their site for a more authoritative content .
But then , coverage - wise , the more unstructured Wikipedia could prove favorable for them than Britannica .
If Britannica 2.0 becomes succesful with this new feature , hopefully Mr. Jimmy Wales would not mind seeing Britannica references side - by - side with Britannica 2.0 on top of Google SERPs .

LOS ANGELES ( Reuters Life ! ) - A U.S. appeals court ruled a California law restricting the sales and rental of violent video games to minors and imposing labeling requirements is too restrictive and violates free speech guarantees .
The Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals found Friday that the labeling requirement unfairly forces video games to carry “ the state ’s controversial opinion ” about which games are violent .
The unanimous opinion by a three - judge panel could have a far - reaching impact on efforts by other states to establish mandatory video game labeling requirements .
The court upheld a lower court finding that California lawmakers failed to produce evidence that violent video games cause psychological or neurological harm to children .
“ Even if it did , the Act is not narrowly tailored to prevent that harm and there remain less restrictive means of forwarding the state ’s purported interests , ” the court wrote .
Those alternative measures include the voluntary ratings system established by the Entertainment Software Rating Board , educational campaigns and parental controls , the court said .
The 2005 law , which requires games described as violent to carry an “ 18 ” label , has been contested by video game publishers , distributors and sellers .
ENTASOPIA , Kenya —
The road from Nairobi winds 100 miles to this town deep in Masai country .
The asphalt gives way to sand and dust , until finally it is just a dirt track climbing over broken hills and plunging back to desert flats .
The going is slow .
The outpost , with about 4,000 inhabitants , is at the end of that road and beyond the reach of power lines .
It has no bank , no post office , few cars and little infrastructure .
Newspapers arrive in a bundle every three or four weeks .
At night , most people light kerosene lamps and candles in their houses or fires in their huts and go to bed early , except for the farmers guarding crops against elephants and buffalo .
Entasopia is the last place on earth that a traveler would expect to find an Internet connection .
Yet it was here , in November , that three young engineers from the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor , with financial backing from Google , installed a small satellite dish powered by a solar panel , to hook up a handful of computers in the community center to the rest of the world .
In recent years the mobile phone has emerged as the main modern communications link for rural areas of Africa .
From 2002 to 2007 , the number of Kenyans using cellphones grew almost tenfold to reach about a third of the population , many of whom did not have land lines , according to the International Telecommunication Union .
Under Mr. Bush , punctuality was a virtue .
Meetings started early  the former president once locked Secretary of State Colin L. Powell out of the Cabinet Room when Mr. Powell showed up a few minutes late  and ended on time .
In the Obama White House , meetings start on time and often finish late .
When the president invited Congressional leaders to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue last week to talk about his economic stimulus package , the session ran so long that Mr. Obama wound up apologizing to the lawmakers  even as he kept them talking , engaging them in the details of the legislation far more than was customary for Mr. Bush .
“ He was concerned that he was keeping us , ” said Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia , the Republican whip .
“ He said , ‘ I know we need to get you all out of here at a certain time . ’
But we continued the discussion .
What are you going to say ?
It ’s the president . ”
If Mr. Obama ’s clock is looser than Mr. Bush ’s , so too are his sartorial standards .
Over the weekend , Mr. Obama ’s first in office , his aides did not quite know how to dress .
Some showed up in the West Wing in jeans ( another no - no under Mr. Bush ) , some in coats and ties .
So the president issued an informal edict for “ business casual ” on weekends  and set his own example .
He showed up Saturday for a briefing with his chief economic adviser , Lawrence H. Summers , dressed in slacks and a gray sweater over a white buttoned - down shirt .
Workers from the Bush White House are shocked .
“ I ’ll never forget going to work on a Saturday morning , getting called down to the Oval Office because there was something he was mad about , ” said Dan Bartlett , who was counselor to Mr. Bush .
“ I had on khakis and a buttoned - down shirt , and I had to stand by the door and get chewed out for about 15 minutes .
He would n’t even let me cross the threshold . ”

Mr. Obama has also brought a more relaxed sensibility to his public appearances .
David Gergen , an adviser to both Republican and Democratic presidents , said Mr. Obama seemed to exude an “ Aloha Zen , ” a kind of comfortable calm that , Mr. Gergen said , reflects a man who “ seems easy going , not so full of himself . ”
As resistance to foreclosure evictions grows among homeowners , community leaders and some law enforcement officials , a broad civil disobedience campaign is starting in New York and other cities to support families who refuse orders to vacate their homes .
The community organizing group Acorn unveiled the campaign with a spirited rally on Friday at a Brooklyn church and will roll it out in at least 22 other cities in the coming weeks .
Through phone trees ,
Web pages and text - messaging networks , the effort will connect families facing eviction with volunteers who will stand at their side as officers arrive , even if it means risking arrest .
“ You want to haul us out to jail ?
Fine .
Let the world see how government has been ineffective , ” Bertha Lewis , Acorn ’s chief organizer , said in an interview .
“ Politicians have helped banks , but they have n’t helped families in the way that it ’s needed , and these families are now saying , enough is enough . ”
At the onset of the foreclosure crisis , the problem was regarded by some as one of a homeowner ’s own making , the result of irresponsible decisions made by families who chose to live beyond their means .
But as foreclosures spread across the country , devastating even solidly middle - class communities , the blame has slowly shifted to the financial companies that made questionable loans and have received billions of dollars in federal aid to stave off collapse .
If the Big Three want Uncle Sam to bail them out , they might have to put up with a nanny looking over their shoulders as they try to turn things around .
The latest word out of Washington is Congress and the White House are inclined to throw Detroit a $ 15 billion lifeline , but the plan includes the appointment of a federal " car czar . "
The autocrat — who , depending upon the final plan , would act independently or as the head of a board of financial experts — would have broad authority to reshape the automakers .
Detroit is so desperate for cash that it 's willing to let Washington put someone in the driver 's seat if it means they 'll stick around past the holidays .
Several reports put Kenneth Feinberg , the attorney who doled out $ 7 billion as special master of the Sept. 11 Victim's Compensation Fund , at the top of the list of candidates .
He 's made a career out of mediating complex disputes , and although he drew some criticism for his handling of the 9/11 fund , he also won support for his adept management of what was a difficult task .
If he does n't want the job , we have some suggestions of our own .
Paul Volker — the former Federal Reserve chariman under Presidents Carter and Reagan is another leading candidate for the gig .
He 's as calming as Valium to the folks on Wall Street .
If he can whip stagflation , he should have no trouble cleaning up Detroit .
Mitt Romney — a long shot , but qualified .
He 's a skilled businessman who rescued the 2002 Winter Olympics from a fiscal morass ; he 's a former governor with loads of experience dealing with big bureaucracies ; and he 's familiar with the auto industry because his father led American Motors .
Romney suggested in a New York Times op - ed that Detroit be allowed to go bankrupt , so you know he 'll play hardball .
Carlos Ghosn —
While Detroit was racing headlong toward insolvency , Ghosn was turning Renault Nissan around .
He slashed costs and brought the company back to profitability faster than anyone expected .
We love him because he 's committed to electric vehicles .
Ghosn has made it clear that the entire industry faces an uncertain future and only innovation can save it .
Sure , he leads a competing company , but he might be up for a new challenge .
Lee Iacocca —
The man , the myth and probably the top choice among the automakers .
Iacocca was the guy who turned Chrysler around the last time it needed a bailout .
Iacocca knows the industry , but he might be a little too biased ( he said the heads of
General Motors and Chrysler should keep their jobs ) to get the nod from Washington .
Steve Jobs —
He saved Apple , and he's got a knack for innovation , design and branding — three things Detroit 's been short on for years .
Al Gore —
Hear us out ...
The inconvenient - truth teller says he does n't want a government job , but seeing him babysit Detroit would be more karmic than OJ 's recent conviction .
Aside from having a vested interest in seeing Detroit build cleaner cars , Gore 's got experience making them do it .
The Clinton administration invested more than $ 1 billion in the Partnership For a New Generation of Vehicles , which brought the Big Three together with government research labs to develop cars that could deliver up to
80 mpg .
Together they developed concept cars that delivered 70 mpg or better , but the Bush administration killed the program in 2001 — at the request of the Big Three .
Gore would almost certainly bring the program back if he got the nod .
You can imagine the cold shrieks of fear in Michigan if his appointment were announced .

SYDNEY ( Reuters ) - A dream job looking after a tropical island in Australia has attracted over 11,000 applicants -- including Osama bin Laden who failed to make the shortlist .
A spokeswoman for Tourism Queensland said the group had received over 11,000 video applications since advertising the A$ 150,000 ( $ 96,000 ) “ best job in the world ” as caretaker of Hamilton Island on the Great Barrier Reef .
One of the applications was a 30 - second prank video showing the world ’s most wanted man , with nonsensical sounds dubbed over his real voice .
Using subtitles , bin Laden argues his case for the six - month contract , describing himself as “ outgoing , ” “ familiar with sandy areas ” and experienced with “ large scale event coordination . ”
He lists his interests as arts , crafts and renovating .
Videos showing bin Laden speaking are widely available on the Internet .
A spokeswoman for Tourism Queensland said a person using bin Laden ’s identity had lodged an official application with required video that has made its way onto video sharing website YouTube , but the application has been rejected .
“ While Tourism Queensland encourages people to be creative in their applications , they have to meet the selection criteria , including appropriate content , if they want to be considered for the job , ” said the spokeswoman .
“ The ‘ Osama bin Laden ’ application was submitted via the www.islandreefjob.com website but it was rejected because the content was not deemed to be appropriate . ”
The $ 1.7 million “ best job in the World ” marketing campaign has attracted huge international interest , with applicants from 162 countries responding to the opening which closes on February 22 .
Queensland ’s Tourism Minister Desley Boyle acknowledges the campaign was aimed to lure visitors to the islands of the Great Barrier Reef but insists the job offer is also genuine .
The successful applicant will have the chance to live rent free on Hamilton Island for six months in an oceanfront villa , spend their time exploring the islands of the Great Barrier Reef .
( CNN ) -- Jason Dinant has the opposite problem of most Americans -- he has flat abs .
Jason Dinant 's New Year 's resolution is to shape up his abs from flat to muscular .
Standing 6 - feet , Dinant has a beanpole leanness many Americans covet .
The 27 - year - old 's ribs protrude from his chest , but he has some fat collecting in his stomach .
" I do n't have that much body fat , but it tends to stick right here in my stomach , " he said pinching his belly .
" My goal is to get a six - pack by summer , " Dinant declared in a video he submitted to iReport.com .
Dinant often peels off his shirt and gives what he calls " the naked truth about today 's news " in Web videos he posts on his blog called " Naked Boy News . "
Watch Dinant 's video .
" I give reports without a shirt on , so I should have the best body , " he said .
" Who wants to see a guy with skinny arms and no abs ? "
CNNhealth.com recently asked viewers to talk about their New Year 's resolutions on iReport.com and to upload photos and videos during their journey to change .
Share your story with iReport.com .
Dinant works in sales during the day and has a night job as an emcee at a Las Vegas , Nevada , night club , where he is surrounded by toned and fit dancers .
" There are go - go boys and girls with killer stomachs , " Dinant said .
" I get up on the stage , I do n't take my shirt off .
I 'm nervous about my stomach . "
He does n't mind going topless on his videos , but he gets self - conscious in person .
With his high school reunion fast approaching this summer , Dinant wants to tone up in the next six months and develop chiseled abs like Shemar Moore of TV's " Criminal Minds " or Ty Pennington , host of " Extreme Makeover : Home Edition . "
Until recently , the extent of Dinant 's exercise has been walking up the stairs and parking his car far away from stores .
Now Dinant works out four times a week in a gym inside his apartment complex , cycling on a stationary bike , using weights on his upper body and doing 500 sit-ups a day .
A televised Britney Spears interview gave him the idea for the sit-ups routine .
" I heard her saying that she'd do 1,000 sit-ups a day , " Dinant said .
" She had amazing abs .
If she can do it , I can do it . "
But the sit -ups get old , Dinant said .
To distract himself , he watches TV shows such as " The Bachelor " while crunching , or he thinks of games ( " Every time you do sit - up , you name an Osmond child " ) to pass the time .
Contrary to popular opinion , traditional sit-ups are n't the most effective way to get a six - pack , said Robert Dothard , a personal trainer based in Atlanta , Georgia .
" Crunches are great to flatten the stomach , " he said .
" For men , we have to put abs under weight resistance to make them stick out . "
The ab segments that make up a six - pack exist under layers of fat and skin .
To make the six - pack more pronounced , a person has to exercise and lose the excess fat so those muscles are visible .
That comes through cardio exercises .
To make those stomach muscles bigger , " abs have to be put under resistance , " Dothard said .
Those muscles need weight training to become bigger and more prominent .
He recommended doing sit-ups on a stability ball while holding a medicine ball over the head and crunching .
Using a resistance band anchored around a stationary bar while performing side - to - side twists also creates resistance , he said .
Dothard demonstrated these moves on a video .
Watch Dothard 's fitness demonstrations . »
Someone with a svelte frame such as Dinant 's may not look as if he or she needs to exercise , but appearances can be deceiving .
" People can be lean , but still carry a lot of fat , " Dothard said .
Research suggests that it 's wise for even lean people to lose the belly fat .
Even with a normal body mass index , people can carry extra weight in their stomachs , which increases the risk for cardiovascular disease .
Those with belly fat have a higher risk of dying compared to their peers without it .
But , Dinant 's reasons for wanting a taut stomach remain purely aesthetic .
" I have my 10 - year high school reunion coming up , " Dinant said .
" I want to go back and be like , ' Bam .
Look at me . ' "

It 's a truism that neoconservatives have a talent for failing upward : for repeatedly getting important things wrong and not seeing their careers suffer - for , in fact , being handed new opportunities to pursue their work ( see , e.g. , Kristol , Bill ; and Hayes , Stephen ) .
Today we can add another name to that list : Laurie Mylroie , the quintessential conspiracy theorist of the Iraq War era , wrote reports about Iraq for the Pentagon as recently as Fall 2007 , years after she was discredited , according to documents obtained by TPMmuckraker .
Mylroie is the author of two studies -- " Saddam 's Strategic Concepts : Dealing With UNSCOM , " dated Feb. 1 , 2007 , and " Saddam 's Foreign Intelligence Service , " dated Sept. 24 , 2007 -- on a list of reports from the Pentagon 's Office Of Net Assessment [ ONA ] , obtained by TPMmuckraker through the Freedom Of Information Act .
The ONA is the Defense Department 's internal think tank , once described by the Washington Post as " obscure but highly influential . "
Those who follow the neoconservative movement closely are stunned that Mylroie has surfaced again -- and especially that she is doing government - sponsored work on Iraq .
" It 's kind of astonishing that the ONA would come even within a mile of her , " says Jacob Heilbrunn , author of They Knew They Were Right : The Rise of the Neocons .
" I think she is completely discredited . "
" I 'm shocked , " Steve Clemons of the New America Foundation says .
" If this came out in 2007 , she was presumably working on it in 2006 , and , by that time , the fate and fortunes of a lot of these people was already switching . "
Why is it so astonishing that a government agency would hire Mylroie to write about Iraq ?
While her career as an Iraq specialist started out auspiciously enough -- she studied and later taught at Harvard , wrote a book on Saddam with Judith Miller in 1990 , and served as an adviser to the 1992 Clinton campaign -- Mylroie later veered outside the mainstream and became enamored with theories rejected by virtually everyone else in the field .
Heilbrunn suggests Mylroie has been underappreciated as one of the intellectual progenitors of the Iraq war .
" She was one of the original fermenters of the idea that Saddam Hussein had these intimate ties with Al Qaeda , " he says .
In the definitive profile of Mylroie , written for the Washington Monthly in 2003 , terrorism analyst Peter Bergen locates Mylroie 's turn in the wake of the 1993 World Trade Center bombing , when she developed her theory that the Iraqi government was behind the attack .
Bergen sums up the animating principle of Mylroie 's work : that " Saddam was the mastermind of a vast anti-U.S. terrorist conspiracy in the face of virtually all evidence and expert opinion to the contrary . "
( For a good example of Mylroie Logic , read her Sept. 13 , 2001 , WSJ op - ed " The Iraqi Connection , " in which she argues that Iraq had a hand in 9/11 because ... well , mainly just because . )
Bergen goes on : Mylroie believes that Saddam was not only behind the '93 Trade Center attack , but also every anti-American terrorist incident of the past decade , from the bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania to the leveling of the federal building in Oklahoma City to September 11 itself .
Mylroie 's theories would n't have mattered - except that she had the ear of Richard Perle , Paul Wolfowitz , Scooter Libby , Jim Woolsey , et al .
Perle blurbed Mylroie 's January 2001 book , Study of Revenge : The First World Trade Center Attack and Saddam Hussein's War against America , as " splendid and wholly convincing . "
In response to TPMmuckaker 's questions about the selection process for ONA researchers , a DOD spokesperson said in a statement : " All aspects of researchers and research institutions are considered , with an emphasis on obtaining the widest range of possible intellectual approaches in order to provide a fully balanced approach to the analysis of future developments . "
And how did the Pentagon use Mylroie 's Iraq reports ?
Says DOD : " These reports were part of a multi - scope research effort to identify the widest possible range of analysts whose expertise was likely to generate insights and concepts which would contribute to Net Assessments on - going work to develop and refine trends , risks , and opportunities which will shape future ( 2020 ) national security environments . "
Mylroie 's work for the Pentagon is all the more interesting because , as her star faded along with the Iraq war , she largely disappeared from the public sphere .
Her most recent public writings consist of a nasty spat with other writers on the right in 2008 .
The Weekly Standard 's Stephen Hayes , himself a prominent perpetuator of falsehoods about Saddam - Al Qaeda links , is one of a group of journalists who cannot stomach Myrloie out of annoyance that her work helps to discredit their own , somewhat less feverish theories .
Hayes has reported , with distaste , that Mylroie believes " al Qaeda is little more than an Iraqi ' front group . ' "
For more , read Daniel Pipes on " Laurie Mylroie 's Shoddy , Loopy , Zany Theories - Exposed . "
While Mylroie is often identified as an " adjunct fellow " at the American Enterprise Institute , an AEI spokesperson calls that category " a very loose relationship " and says that the main link between Mylroie and the think tank was the publication of her book back in 2001 .
Laurie Mylroie did not respond to emails seeking comment .
The DOD spokesperson has promised to send me copies of Mylroie 's Iraq reports .
We 'll tell you more when we hear anything .
Moving a little further inward , there 's a lot of fun chipware you could theoretically wire just into your skull .
Right now we 're limited to cochlear implants and a few transmitters that can move a cursor on a screen , but in the world of Cyberpunk , anything implanted is possible .
So where do we go with this ?
Cellphones for starters , probably .
A new law recently enacted in California requires drivers to use hands - free headsets , and with everybody running around with their bluetooth nodes riding on their ears , I think it 's only a matter of time before the same technology becomes subdermal , or better - connected directly to the brain .
But that 's just a start - think about your own mind , and all the things you 'd change about it if you could .
Like what ?
Well , how about better memory ?
If Microsoft or Apple made a chip that could give you a photographic memory with flawless recall , how much would you pay for it ?
Chips that add languages and skills might work too , and with direct access to the brain , why not make games that interface directly with the mind .
Companies are already testing brain - interface controllers for video games , so what 's to stop us from going the extra step and putting a virtual screen where the mind 's eye is as well .
Tired all the time ?
How about an implant that keeps you at your peak level of comfort and performance until you choose to put your body in sleep - mode ?
For some people , there 's definitely an appeal to being able to pick and choose upgrades for one 's brain in the same way we upgrade our computers - the possibilities for improvement are only limited by your imagination .
You might even go to drastic levels with it - think stripping the sheathing off the myelin and re-sheathing it with something hotrod that cuts reaction time in half .
Oh yeah .
Accused honeymoon killer David Gabriel ( Gabe ) Watson is required to face an Australian court for the first time tomorrow .
Late last year prosecutors filed an indictment in the Townsville Supreme Court against Watson , 31 , over the death of his wife Tina , 26 , on the Great Barrier Reef on October 22 , 2003 .
The indictment requires him to appear in court tomorrow .
Last July , police in Prince Georges County , Maryland , made national news headlines when their SWAT team raided the home of Berwyn Heights Mayor Cheye Calvo .
Police had tracked a box containing marijuana to Calvo 's porch , and when he carried the box inside upon returning home , the SWAT team struck .
Team members broke down the door , restrained Calvo and his mother - in - law for hours , and shot and killed Calvo's two Labrador retrievers , one while running away .
PolitickerMD cartoon about the Berwyn Heights raid
It would have been just another SWAT raid , except for two things : Calvo and his wife are well - liked public figures , and Calvo was an innocent victim .
The real culprits in the case artfully protected their marijuana shipments by having them delivered to unknowing people , in this case the mayor of Berwyn Heights .
Now , in the wake of the Calvo incident , as well as other well - known SWAT raids gone bad , such as the one last year in which a 26 - year - old Lima , Ohio , woman was killed and the one a few months later in which a Pennsylvania FBI agent was shot dead by a homeowner who claimed she thought she was defending her family from intruders , a handful of Maryland legislators are trying to rein in the SWAT teams .
A bill filed earlier this month , SB 447 , would require police departments to monitor their SWAT team use and report it annually to the governor and the General Assembly .
As the bill puts it :
" On a monthly basis , beginning January 1 , 2010 , a law enforcement agency that maintains a SWAT team shall report the following information to the office of the attorney general using the format developed under subsection ( c ) of this section :
(1 ) the number of times the SWAT team was activated and deployed by the law enforcement agency in the previous month ;
( 2 ) without identifying an exact address , the approximate location within or outside of the jurisdiction of the law enforcement agency to which the SWAT team was deployed for each activation ;
( 3 ) the reason for each activation and deployment of the SWAT team ;
( 4 ) the legal authority , including type of warrant , if any , for each activation and deployment of the SWAT team ; and
( 5 ) the result of each activation and deployment of the SWAT team , including :
( i ) the number of arrests made , if any ;
( ii ) the type of evidence seized , if any ;
( iii ) whether a forcible entry was made ;
( iv ) whether a weapon was discharged by a SWAT team member ; and
( v ) whether a person or domestic animal was injured or killed by a SWAT team member . "
" This bill is an important first step that does n't restrict [ SWAT ] use , " Calvo told the DC Examiner .
" It merely brings transparency . "
And that would be a much needed beginning to reining in the SWAT teams , which were originally intended for hostage situations and other high - risk affairs , but have ended up being used routinely in drug raids and other law enforcement endeavors .
If the bill passes , Maryland would be the first state in the nation to demand accountability from its law enforcement agencies when it comes to SWAT teams .

Boy , is Barack Obama one smooth politician or what ?
The NY Post is reporting that the President is having a bipartisan group of House and Senate members over to the White House for a few drinks so that they can talk about the pending stimulus bill .
Just like he did in Illinois -- against tougher odds than he faces now -- expect Obama to change at least a few minds .
NY Post :
President Barack Obama has invited Republican and Democratic lawmakers for drinks at the White House as they consider his economic recovery bill that still faces opposition .
White House aides say about two dozen key members of Congress were invited to the Executive Mansion Wednesday evening .
The guest list includes six House Democrats , six House Republicans and five senators from each party .

The UN says it is seriously concerned for civilians in the region Nine people have been killed by shells which hit a hospital in a rebel - held area of north - east Sri Lanka , the Red Cross says .
The hospital , in the town of Puthukkudiyiruppu , Mullaitivu district , was hit three times in 24 hours , aid officials said .
UN spokesman Gordon Weiss told the BBC the shells had hit a crowded paediatric unit .
It is not clear who fired them .
Sri Lanka 's army has denied it was behind the shelling .
There has been no comment so far from the rebel group , the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LTTE ) .
See map of the region Puthukkudiyiruppu is situated in an enclave held by the rebels , and is home to tens of thousands of civilians .
Details unclear Sophie Romanens , a spokeswoman for the International Committee of the Red Cross ( ICRC ) , said the shelling killed at least nine people and injured 20 inside the hospital premises , adding that many more had been killed outside .
The shells , which came during constant fighting , hit the hospital 's kitchen and chapel as well as a ward where there were women and children , Ms Romanens told the BBC .
Mr Weiss said the first shell hit the hospital - one of area 's last functioning health facilities , which has some 500 inpatients - shortly before midnight ( 1830 GMT ) .
He said the last message the UN had received from their staff member on the ward said : " Woman and kids ' ward shelled ...
Still trying to count the dead bodies . "

Fears over Sri Lanka war children Voices from Sri Lanka Tamil fighting capacity reduced
He said the hospital had been so full , with many patients lying on the floor , that anything landing on it was " almost guaranteed to cause significant casualties " .
Mr Weiss called the strikes " significant breaches of international humanitarian law " .
The strikes have prompted protests from the Red Cross .
" We 're shocked that the hospital was hit , and this for the second time in recent weeks , " said Paul Castella , head of the Colombo delegation of the ICRC .
" Wounded and sick people , medical personnel and medical facilities are all protected by international humanitarian law .
Under no circumstance may they be directly attacked . "
' Protection '
An army offensive has pushed the rebels into a 300 sq km ( 110 sq mile ) corner of jungle in the north - east of the island , which aid agencies say also holds 250,000 civilians .
Sri Lankan soldiers captured Mullaitivu last Sunday
The government says the number of civilians is closer to 120,000 and that the army has a policy of not firing at civilians .
It accuses the Tamil Tigers of not allowing civilians to leave , saying they are being used as human shields .
Sri Lanka 's military says it has designated a safe zone for civilians in a 32 sq km buffer zone on the A - 35 main road which links Paranthan and Mullaitivu .
But the rebels say the civilians prefer to stay where they are under rebel " protection " .
The reports cannot be independently confirmed as neither side allows journalists near the war zone .
Senior UN officials say there may have been very grave breaches of human rights by both sides .
' Utmost care '
Officials said about 300 civilians had crossed into government - held territory during the 48 - hour truce , which expired late on Saturday .
" We will now have to save the civilians and move in , " said a government spokesman , Kaheliya Rambukwella .
" It is now very evident that [ Tamil Tiger leader Valupillai ] Prabhakaran is ... using civilians as cover , " said Mr Rambukwella .
" We will take the utmost care of civilians when we move in . "
The military has captured the key towns of Kilinochchi , Mullaitivu and the strategically important Elephant Pass to the Jaffna peninsula in recent weeks .

Despite a shrinking national economy and a record defense budget , U.S. neoconservatives and other hawks are mounting a spirited  if misleading  campaign to persuade Congress that the military should get a bigger slice .
They are calling on Congress and President Barack Obama to boost military spending next year even beyond the projections made by the administration of former President George W. Bush as to what would be needed .
They are also arguing for devoting tens of billions of dollars of the nearly one - trillion - dollar economic stimulus package that Obama is trying to push through Congress by mid-February to defense spending , insisting that increased orders from largely U.S. - based military contractors should translate quickly into more jobs at a time when the official unemployment rate is moving quickly toward two digits .
" These kinds of expenditures not only make economic good sense , but would help close the large and long - standing gap between U.S. strategy and military resources , " wrote Tom Donnelly , a military analyst at the American Enterprise Institute ( AEI ) , a predominantly neoconservative think tank , last month .
" If bridges need fixing , so too do the tools with which our military fights , " he argued , adding that Congress should increase defense spending by at least 20 billion dollars a year .
" A critical element in any recovery will be strengthening the foundations of a global economy , built upon U.S. worldwide security guarantees . "
The campaign , which coincides with increased spending by major defense contractors for lobbying activities , comes at a critical moment for the new administration , which is focused more on getting the stimulus package passed quickly than on its precise content and on getting its key appointees confirmed and in place in the sprawling bureaucracies that make up the government .
The administration is also still putting together its fiscal year ( FY ) 2010 budget and is not expected to release details until next month , less than seven months before the fiscal year begins .
For now , the White House Office of Management and Budget ( OMB ) is insisting that the Pentagon ’s budget ’s be set at 527 billion dollars for next year , consistent with the Bush administration ’s estimates as to its needs for FY 2010 , an eight percent increase over the current year ’s military budget .
That amount , which does not include the roughly 170 billion dollars Washington is spending this year on ongoing military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan and elsewhere in what the Bush administration called the " global war on terror " , already makes up more than 40 percent of the world ’s total military expenditures .
But , as pointed out this week by the influential Congressional Quarterly , the Pentagon ’s bureaucracy and hawks in think tanks and Congress are insisting that OMB ’s request actually amounts to a 10 - percent cut in a 584 - billion - dollar recommendation submitted by the Joint Chiefs of Staff last fall in an apparent attempt to pressure the incoming president into a major increase .
On Jan. 30 , the conservative broadcast outlet , Fox News , quoted what it called a senior Defense official as saying that the administration was demanding a 55 - billion - dollar cut in defense spending .
At that point , other voices jumped in .
Max Boot , a neoconservative military analyst at the influential Council on Foreign Relations ( CFR ) , asserted that Pentagon chief Robert Gates had opposed the OMB ’s ceiling and warned that if Obama did not overrule it , " he could be doing terrible damage not only to our armed forces but also to his carefully cultivated image of moderation . "
The following day , Robert Kagan , a leading neoconservative ideologue at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace , joined the outcry in his monthly column in the Washington Post , offering five reasons why " a ten percent cut in defense spending " could have disastrous geopolitical implications by signaling to U.S. enemies that " the American retreat has begun " .
" At a time when people talk of trillion - dollar stimulus packages , cutting 10 percent from the defense budget is a pittance , especially given the high price we will pay in America ’s global position , " he wrote .
" … ( T ) his is not the time to start weakening the armed forces . "
" It ’s pretty remarkable , " said William Hartung , director of the Arms and Security Initiative at the New America Foundation ( NAF ) .
" Obama agrees to Bush ’s ( defense budget ) increase , and the neocons are running around saying , ‘ Oh , he ’s gutting the military ’ . "
Hartung and other defense analysts see this latest maneuver as part of a larger campaign by the Pentagon bureaucracy and the defense industry , which anticipated growing pressure on the defense budget even before the outbreak of the current financial crisis in September , to protect their interests even at a time when the Pentagon ’s political leadership recognizes that huge increases in military spending they enjoyed during the Bush era are not sustainable .
Overall , military spending increased by about 60 percent since Bush took office in 2001 , not including the costs of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
In addition to the apparent disinformation about the alleged " cut " in defense spending , the Pentagon ’s allies in the media have been pushing hard for increased military spending to be made a part of the stimulus package .
That campaign was launched in late December when Martin Feldstein , former President Ronald Reagan ’s chief economic adviser and an AEI fellow , argued in the Wall Street Journal for at least 30 billion dollars to expand military procurement , research , and recruitment .
Such an expansion could create some 330,000 jobs , he estimated in an article entitled " Defense Spending Would Be Great Stimulus " .
" Military procurement has the further advantage that almost all of the equipment and supplies that the military buys is made in the United States … " he noted .
" … Because of the current very high and rising unemployment rates among young men and women , " he added , " … now is also a good time for the military to increase recruiting and training . "
Frank Gaffney , Jr. , president of the Center for Security Policy ( CSP ) , quickly echoed that message in his weekly Washington Times column .
" I have long believed it is a mistake to use the defense budget as a jobs program .
We should buy military hardware because it is needed for our security , not to boost employment , " he wrote .
" That said , where increased employment follows from making necessary investments in our armed forces ’ capabilities to fight today ’s wars  and , no less important , tomorrow ’s  it would be absurd not to include the Pentagon in an economic stimulus package . "
Meanwhile , the major military contractors have stepped up their lobbying efforts .
According to the Wall Street Journal , three of the biggest companies  Lockheed - Martin , Boeing , and Northrop - Grumman  boosted their multi-million - dollar lobbying budgets by between 54 percent and 90 percent beginning in 2008 as it became clear that the Bush spending binge was nearing an end .
According to Hartung and other Pentagon critics , now is the critical moment for a reformist administration to begin cutting the defense budget , notably by canceling expensive conventional - weapons systems , such as the F - 22 fighter jets and the V - 22 Osprey aircraft that have proved both hugely expensive and of dubious utility .
" They have a chance to stop the train and start moving back in the right direction , " he told IPS .
" If they do n’t take it now , it ’ll just get harder down the road . "
" The problem is they ’re not getting huge public pressure to cut , whereas they are getting a lot of pressure to spend more , " he said .

HOW THE HOUSING CRISIS UNFOLDED HOW THE HOUSING CRISIS UNFOLDED REACTIONS TO OBAMA'S SPEECH REACTIONS TO OBAMA'S SPEECH FEDERAL AGENCIES CARRYING OUT THE HOUSING PLAN FEDERAL AGENCIES CARRYING OUT THE HOUSING PLAN WASHINGTON --
The Obama administration will rely on an array of federal agencies to implement its broad housing plan .
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac :
The plan would provide government aid to restructure as many as 5 million mortages owned or guaranteed by Fannie and Freddie .
The government - sponsored entities were created to spur the housing market by buying , bundling and reselling mortgages in the form of bonds .
Fannie and Freddie , now in government receivership , also hold mortgages in their own portfolios .
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. :
The FDIC , one of several federal bank regulators , insures deposits in banks and thrifts up to $ 250,000 .
Under Obama 's plan , the FDIC and Treasury will manage a $ 10 billion fund to provide insurance payments to entitities that hold mortgages modified under the program .
Federal Housing Administration :
The FHA provides mortgage insurance on single - family , multifamily and manufactured homes made by FHA - approved lenders .
FHA loan programs reach lower - income and first - time homebuyers .
The FHA is already implementing mortgage refinance programs developed by Congress and the Bush administration .
Federal Reserve :
The nation 's central bank , the Fed is also a chief bank regulator .
The Fed affects the housing market through interest rate policy , and bank oversight .
The Fed has also proposed tightening rules for mortgage lending , nationwide .
Department of Housing and Urban Development ( HUD ) :
The federal agency with main responsibility for the housing industry and government - subsidized housing , including the FHA .

The Obama administration 's $ 75 billion housing rescue plan promises to help millions of financially struggling homeowners keep their homes , but it may be too little and too late for millions of others .
More than 3 million owners have lost their homes during the past three years , and almost 5 million more could follow this year through 2011 , according to Moody's Economy.com .
Obama 's plan calls for measures that will allow up to 9 million homeowners to reduce their mortgage payments through government - backed refinancing arrangements .
Just how that will work is n't clear .
The administration said that on March 4 it will provide more details on the plan and when it will go into effect .
Until then , homeowners in trouble — many of whom have adjustable - rate loans with rising payments and little chance of refinancing because of falling property values — are being urged to check with their lenders to see whether they might benefit .
FORECLOSURE PLAN : ' Chance to rebuild , ' Obama says THEIR TAKE : 4 affected by foreclosure react BANKRUPTCY CHANGE : Judges can alter mortgages HOUSING STARTS : Record low ; mortgage applications jump VIDEO : Reactions to Obama 's speech in Mesa , Ariz .
The Obama plan reaches out to those at risk of default , rather than just those already facing foreclosure , and it offers mortgage servicers — the firms that collect payments — financial incentives to modify loans .
In addition , the Treasury Department said Wednesday it will commit up to $ 200 billion more to mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to try to keep mortgage rates low .
It pledged $ 200 billion — $ 100 billion apiece — to them last fall when the government took them over .
Many heralded the plan Wednesday but also raised questions about how successful it will be .
On Capitol Hill , some Republicans — amplifying criticisms by homeowners who did n't buy more expensive houses than they could afford and have paid their mortgages on time — challenged the fairness of an expensive bailout .
House Republican Leader John Boehner , R - Ohio , and Republican Whip Eric Cantor , R - Va. , sent the president a letter asking , " What will your plan do for the over 90 % of homeowners who are playing and paying by the rules ? "
Economists had a more measured reaction .
" This is a nice mix of policy steps that will have a mitigating impact on foreclosures , " says Mark Zandi of Moody's Economy.com .
" It wo n't stem foreclosures , but it will mitigate the increase . "
Establishing a standard loan - modification process that applies to most mortgage servicers will help spur refinancing and modifications while providing legal coverage to ward off lawsuits by investors , Zandi says .
Reducing foreclosures and stemming the historic decline in housing prices are crucial to repairing the overall economy .
Falling home prices have hurt banks and other financial firms , leaving them less able to lend .
States and localities have taken a hit in the form of declining tax revenue and blighted neighborhoods .
The housing free fall has plagued home builders as foreclosed homes have gone back on the market , swelling an already huge inventory .
Prospective homeowners have found it increasingly difficult to get credit as asset prices fell and worried bankers tightened loan standards .
Some buyers , on a bet that prices will fall even further , have decided to postpone buying a house , thereby lengthening and deepening the crisis .
In a speech Wednesday , Cleveland Fed President Sandra Pianalto noted that housing starts have plunged by more than 60 % since peaking in 2006 , with builders now holding a huge , 14 - month inventory .
" Stabilizing housing prices will help stem foreclosures , bolster bank balance sheets , restore consumer confidence and shore up consumer spending , " she said .
The new efforts come atop a recent Fed initiative to buy mortgage - backed securities , which Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke said Wednesday had pushed mortgage rates down by nearly a full percentage point .
But the coordinated efforts have their limits .
" The Fed and the Treasury will do all they can to drive mortgage rates lower , " says Richard Schlanger , portfolio manager for the Pioneer mutual funds .
But banks continue to tighten their lending standards , which means that mortgages at low rates still could be tough to get .
Furthermore , few banks will want a portfolio full of mortgages yielding 4.5 % if they think rates will rise later , Schlanger says .
Homeowners who were financially conservative and can meet their monthly mortgage payments have a stake in the housing plan 's success .
Americans have lost as much as $ 13 trillion in wealth as stock and home prices have plunged , says Nariman Behravesh , chief economist of IHS Global Insight .
Because household spending is related to household wealth , declining home and stock prices have contributed to a staggering fall in consumer spending .
" The wealth effect is humongous , " he says .
Those who will be directly helped by the Obama plan include homeowners on the cusp of foreclosure , those making monthly payments but struggling to do so and those at risk of falling behind .
They include people such as Rodney Rose , who is fighting so hard to make his mortgage payments he 's put off payments on credit cards and other debts .
The Bowie , Md. , resident has watched the value of his home fall from about $ 425,000 to $ 319,000 , and he 's worried about how to pay his mortgage once his adjustable - rate loan moves to a higher rate .
" I 'm struggling .
I had to stop paying my student loans , " says Rose , a father of two and who works in the housing industry .
" But with this plan , I 'm hopeful . "
A question of fairness ?
Other homeowners are n't as pleased .
They worry that the plan amounts to a handout to homeowners who stretched to afford more than they could , and that it is n't fair to mortgage holders who make payments on time .
Ted Hellier , 53 , a carpenter in South Portland , Maine , says he pays three mortgages on time every month and has never had a late payment in 20 years .
For him , the Obama plan raises a question of fairness .
" People like me deserve to have a chance to lower our mortgage payments , " says Hellier .
" I am tired of handouts .
Other people can renegotiate loans to 4 % and other ( favorable terms ) .
I have a 14 - and an 11 - year - old , and their grandkids are going to pay for this nonsense . "
And others fear the plan wo n't do enough to slow foreclosures already underway .
For a large number of homeowners already on the brink of default , the Obama administration 's housing rescue plan may not help .
" There are a lot of carrots in the plan , and it will help , but it's not the silver bullet , " Zandi says .
" We will still see foreclosures . " Just ask Denise Parker .
The financial rescue plan sounds like a promising way to help out troubled homeowners like herself .
But for her , the plan seems too late .
The single mother of three can't pay her adjustable - rate mortgage , whose monthly payments have jumped from $ 3,700 in 2005 to more than $ 4,000 today .
She works two jobs to try to make enough money to get by , but she 's behind in house payments and has gotten a foreclosure letter saying her home will be up for auction Friday .
" What do I tell my kids ? " Parker asks .
" I do n't know where I 'm going to go . "
Help for refinancers
A key element of the plan is refinancing help .
Homeowners who took out loans owned or guaranteed by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac will be able to refinance through those institutions , even if they owe more than their homes are worth .
Currently , homeowners who owe more than 80 % of the value of their homes have difficulty refinancing .
Nearly one in seven homeowners , or about 12 million , are " under water , " meaning their home 's value is less than the amount of their mortgage , according to Moody 's Economy.com .
That 's nearly double the 6.6 million who were in that position at the end of 2007 .
The plan also includes incentives to encourage mortgage servicers — who collect fees for refinanced and delinquent mortgages — to work with qualified borrowers to modify loans .
Servicers will get $ 1,000 for each eligible modification they make , and another $ 1,000 a year for three years as long as the homeowner remains current on payments .
Homeowners who stay in their properties and are current will get a monthly balance reduction to help reduce their loan principal .
That will amount to up to $ 1,000 a year for five years .
Government funds would be used to avoid defaults .
The plan includes an incentive of $ 500 to lenders and $ 1,500 to homeowners if loans are modified before mortgage holders fall behind .
Other parts of the plan aimed at stabilizing the housing market are particularly controversial .
The administration 's endorsement of a change in the bankruptcy law , which requires congressional approval , would give bankruptcy judges the power to lower the interest rate or extend the repayment period on home mortgages .
More significant , it would allow them to reduce the principal amount owed to the home 's fair market value , says Sam Gerdano of the American Bankruptcy Institute .
Many modification programs in force now do n't do that .
Instead , homeowners may be allowed to defer back payments , or get more time to pay their loans , but some default again .
Much of the financial services industry has opposed the change , arguing that a more lenient law could be used by homeowners to get rid of homes that have declined in value , even if they can afford their mortgage payments .
Under the current bankruptcy law , judges can modify a mortgage for a vacation home or a commercial building but not for a principal residence , says Henry Hildebrand , a Chapter 13 bankruptcy trustee in Nashville .

A South Korean grandmother has failed her written driving test 771 times .
Police in the city of Jeonju said the 68 - year - old woman has taken , and failed , the written test repeatedly since April 2005 .
She failed the exam once again on Monday but has said that she will continue trying .
The woman , identified only by her family name Cha , has repeatedly scored between 30 and 50 marks , below the pass mark of 60 out of 100 .
The Korea Times reports that Mrs Cha sells food and household items door to door at apartment complexes .
She currently carries the items in a handcart , but thought that she might need a car for her business .
Police estimate she has spent more than four million won ( £ 2,000 ) to take the written test , with each test costing 6,000 won , in addition to other expenses .
" I feel sorry every time I see Cha fail .
When she passes , I 'll make a commemorative tablet myself and give it to her , " says Park Jung - seok , a traffic police officer .
Mrs Cha has said that she will be back for another attempt .
If she passes , then she can begin the practical test .
SAN FRANCISCO , Feb 27 ( Reuters ) - California ’s unemployment rate rose to 10.1 percent in January from a revised 8.7 percent in December and 6.1 percent a year earlier as recession tightened its grip on the economy of the most populous U.S. state , state officials said on Friday .
Economists had expected California ’s jobless rate to climb into double - digits because consumer spending across the state plunged in the wake of Wall Street ’s turmoil and payrolls have been thinned at a rapid pace in recent months as companies responded to a weakening national economy .
The state ’s economy , the world ’s eighth largest , also continues to suffer from a prolonged housing downturn .

Washington , D.C. —
Today , U.S. District Court Judge Ricardo M. Urbina ruled in favor of conservation groups on a temporary injunction they filed against the Bureau of Land Management ( BLM ) over the leasing of more than 110,000 acres of Utah wilderness .
Earthjustice sought the injunction December 22 on behalf of the Natural Resources Defense Council ( NRDC ) , the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance , and the Wilderness Society , and Earthjustice .
The groups filed a lawsuit December 17 to stop the leasing .
The groups argued that the leases did not meet legal requirements regarding air quality analysis , the impacts of climate change , and the presence of archaeological sites .
One of the contested areas , Nine Mile Canyon , is world - renowned for its remarkable rock art panels and other cultural features .
" In their rush to get these leases out the door , the Bush administration cut corners , " said Robin Cooley , attorney at Earthjustice .
" We are hopeful that the Obama administration will reconsider BLM 's decision to sacrifice these magnificent lands to development . "
" This ruling makes clear that allowing oil and gas companies to lease and drill on Utah 's public lands would cause permanent and irreparable damage to some of our nation 's most pristine wilderness , " said Sharon Buccino , Senior Attorney for NRDC .
" The case will now be heard in court , and we will do all we can to permanently protect Utah 's wilderness . "
The merits of the case will be heard later in 2009 .
Until that time , BLM is prohibited from cashing the checks issued for the contested acres of Utah wilderness .
" We 're thrilled with this decision , " said Stephen Bloch , Conservation Director for the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance .
" BLM 's attempt to sell these leases just before the Bush administration left office has been showcases for what it really is -- a parting gift to the oil and gas industry .
Judge Urbina 's decision firmly puts the brakes on these plans . "
The contested areas near Arches and Canyonlands National Parks , Dinosaur National Monument , and Nine Mile Canyon include lands that contain the nation 's greatest density of ancient rock art and other cultural resources .
These lands were recently made available to industry through hastily approved resource management plans that have serious ramifications for 3 million acres of public lands .

Wow , this just keeps getting better ….( Insert eye roll here )
Octomom Nadya Suleman and her 14 kids are soon to be homeless .
Extra has obtained documents stating that Suleman ’s mother , Angela Suleman , has fallen 10 months behind in payments for her 3 - bedroom home in Whittier , California and owes the mortgage company $ 23,225 !
In 2006 , Angela borrowed $ 453,750 from IndyMac Bank , agreeing to make monthly payments on her loan , but last May she stopped making the payments .
In 2008 , Angela filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy , claiming she has between $ 500,000 and $ 1,000,000 in liabilities .
The bankruptcy case was later dismissed .
Extra caught up with Suleman and asked her about the house where she responded :
“ It ’s not my home .
I got to move .
Yeah , I need a new house . ” “ Who ’s gonna buy it for me ?
I mean , it ’s for the kids ….. right ?! “
WOW !
Who are these people trying to fool ?
I mean , it ’s so hard to help out those poor innocent little babies because look who is really getting the help .

ST PETERSBURG ( Reuters ) - A Russian woman in St Petersburg killed her drunk husband with a folding couch , Russian media reported on Wednesday .
St Petersburg ’s Channel Five said the man ’s wife , upset with her husband for being drunk and refusing to get up , kicked a handle after an argument , activating a mechanism that folds the couch up against a wall .
The couch , which doubles as a bed , folds up automatically in order to save space .
The man fell between the mattress and the back of the couch , Channel Five quoted emergency workers as saying .
The woman then walked out of the room and returned three hours later to check on what she thought was an unusually quiet sleeping husband .
Police refused to comment .
The St Petersburg Emergency Services Ministry said a private rescue service removed the man ’s body .
Video on the television channel ’s website showed emergency workers sawing away the side panels of a couch to remove a man in his underwear lying headfirst between the cushions .
Emergency workers said the man died instantly .

At the time of publication , it represented the best available science .
For those who track their local temperatures using the Celsius scale , 40 degrees is a daunting number .
In early February 2009 , residents of southeastern Australia were cringing at their weather forecasts , as predictions of temperatures above 40 degrees Celsius ( 104 degrees Fahrenheit ) meant that a blistering heat wave was continuing .
This map of Australia shows how the land surface temperature from January 25 to February 1 compared to the average mid-summer temperatures the continent experienced between 2000 - 2008 .
Places where temperatures were warmer than average are red , places experiencing near - normal temperatures are white , and places where temperatures were cooler than average are blue .
The data were collected by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ( MODIS ) on NASA ’s Terra satellite .
While southern Australia was scorching , a similarly large area of northern and central Australia was several degrees cooler than it was in the previous nine years .
The cool anomaly across that region is probably linked to the above - average rainfall the area has received during this year ’s wet season .
Land surface temperature is how hot the surface of the Earth would feel to the touch in a particular location .
From a satellite ’s point of view , the “ surface ” is whatever it sees when it looks through the atmosphere to the ground .
That could be the sand on a beach , the grass on a lawn , the roof of a building , or a paved road .
Thus , daytime land surface temperature is often much higher than the air temperature that is included in the daily weather report — a fact that anyone who has walked barefoot across a parking lot on a summer afternoon could verify .
The Australian Bureau of Meteorology ( BOM ) called this heat wave “ exceptional , ” not only for the high temperatures but for their duration .
One - day records were broken in multiple cities , with temperatures in the mid-40s .
In Kyancutta , South Australia , the temperature reached 48.2 degrees Celsius ( 118.8 degrees Fahrenheit ) .
Many places also set records for the number of consecutive days with record - breaking heat .
Nighttime temperatures broke records , too .
In their special statement on the heat wave , the BOM wrote , “ On the morning of 29 January , an exceptional event also occurred in the northern suburbs of Adelaide around 3 a.m. , when strong north - westerly winds mixed hot air aloft to the surface .
At RAAF Edinburgh [ a regional airport ] , the temperature rose to 41.7 °C at 3:04 a.m .
Such an event appears to be without known precedent in southern Australia . ”

The media was out in droves this week heaping praise on Obama for this first great victory .
The Washington Post led off with , " Twenty - four days into his presidency , Barack Obama recorded last night a legislative achievement of the sort that few of his predecessors achieved at any point in their tenure .
In size and scope , there is almost nothing in history to rival the economic stimulus legislation that Obama shepherded through Congress in just over three weeks . "
Nonsense .
A one sided party juggernaut is hardly an historic legislative victory .
There is nothing praiseworthy about it .
Not only does it set a huge precedent of misusing government funds , but it is n't going to work .
Markets around the world were not impressed either .
Stocks dropped , more store closings were announced and layoffs continued .
It has quickly become clear , as in the TARP program , that these bailouts have done nothing but widen the expectations for unlimited outflows of paper money and encourage people to line up for " their share . "
Current recipients are already asking for more .
GM and Chrysler are threatening bankruptcy if Congress does n't add another $ 14 billion to their bailout .
But , there simply is n't enough demand for all these models and brands of vehicles .
Some are going to keep going down until they fail .
But , now that the Congress and the taxpayers have started down this bailout path , they will feel obligated to even more bailouts just to " safeguard the public 's investment . "
Auto parts suppliers now want a share too , asking for $ 18.5 Billion in aid .
Where does it all end ?
Now that the proverbial foot is in the door , there will be no end to future deficits until something else breaks -- like the dollar itself .
Gold just surpassed $ 1000 / Oz. , a harbinger of the dollar 's growing weakness .
Peter Schiff , of Euro Pacific Capital continues to warn that this is only the beginning .
" The intense scrutiny recently paid to my investment strategy in the immediate wake of the financial crisis of the last six months [ he lost money for his investors even though he correctly saw the mortgage collapse coming ] has unfortunately obscured the central element of my larger economic forecast .
The standard line has been that although I was able to predict the crash , in the form of the housing collapse and the credit crunch , my expected fallout of a weaker dollar and global decoupling has been proven false .
However , this assumes that the crash has fully played out [ He 's right .
It 's still coming ] .
" In reality , all we have heard thus far is the overture .
In 2008 , the bubble economy that I had meticulously described years ago finally hit the pin that I knew was out there .
The corporate losses , frozen credit markets and plunging home prices were the opening salvo in the unfolding economic crisis .
However , the vast majority of air has yet to leak out of the bubble .
As it does , the U.S. economic crisis will kick into a much higher gear [ the commercial real estate shoe is starting to drop ] .
Thus far , our economy has actually been spared the worst due to the temporary strength in the dollar and the recent desirability of our Government 's debt ...
The demand for U.S. Treasuries has led to one of the sharpest dollar rallies on record , which has helped bring about just as pronounced a decline in commodity prices .
As a result , although consumer income has fallen , so too have prices and interest rates .
" The stronger dollar gives the Federal Government plenty of cover to pursue a policy of rampant monetary inflation in order to re-inflate the collapsing bubble .
Even though the Federal Reserve has thrown trillions of new dollars into circulation , those dollars have actually gained purchasing power - contrary to economic law .
This , along with inventory liquidations and going - out - of - business sales , has kept a lid on consumer prices .
The continued , although misguided , appeal of U.S. debt has also made it possible for the government to garner cheap financing for its equally misguided and massive bails - outs and stimulus packages .
In addition to cushioning the blow for us , the dollar rally has exacerbated the pain abroad .
As money has rushed to our aid it has created a global credit crunch .
The rest of the world is not only dealing with losses on toxic U.S. credit instruments but is also shouldering the burden of financing our new borrowing as well .
As foreign currencies have fallen , foreign consumers have not received as large a windfall as Americans have from falling commodity prices .
In effect , Americans have been using these life - lines to pull the rest of the world into the stormy seas .
However , there are signs that those holding the lines are about to cast them adrift .
The dollar rally has run out of steam , gold has clearly broken out , and commodity prices are moving back up .
2009 is already the worst year ever for US .
Treasury bonds and foreign stock markets are once again outperforming ours .
" This week President Obama claimed that failure to pass his economic stimulus bill will have catastrophic consequences for the US economy .
The reality is the catastrophe will be far greater with his plan then without it .
If the trends of January and early February of 2009 continue , the rug will be completely pulled out from beneath the U.S. economy , and the full cost of the President 's ' economic depressant package ' will be apparent to all .
If foreign capital does not continue to pour into Treasuries , interest rates and consumer prices in the U.S. will soar .
At that point , we will finally be confronted with the real crises that I have long predicted .
When the day of reckoning arrives our policy response will be critical .
If we continue on the course our new President has mapped out , the catastrophe will far exceed the scope of any he hoped to avoid . "

The government 's multi-billion pound insurance scheme to ring - fence British banks ' toxic assets and reboot lending to the recession - hit economy has run into a wall of opposition in the EU , the Guardian has learned .
The European commission and several leading EU countries are understood to have objected that the UK proposals are a serious threat to competition and to the much - prized single market .
The commission is due to publish final guidance on how to treat their toxic or impaired assets next Wednesday .
It is understood to be insisting that the UK Treasury impose a hefty premium on the banks benefiting from the insurance .
Royal Bank of Scotland , soon to be 70 % owned by the British taxpayer , is the guinea pig for the scheme which is regarded as vital in ring - fencing an estimated £ 150bn of toxic assets on its balance sheet .
Details of the scheme are yet to be finalised , but there are expectations of a government announcement when RBS publishes its 2008 figures - expected to show a £ 28bn loss - next Thursday .
Analysts at Credit Suisse have assumed that RBS and other banks signing up to the insurance scheme would pay an annual fee of 3 % and might not have to pay in the first year of what might be a three - to five - year arrangement .
The government has made it clear that RBS would not have to find the cash - which would indicate annual payments of £ 4.5 bn - but could pay in other ways .
The Credit Suisse analysts suggest that RBS , which has received £ 20bn of government funds , could pay using deferred tax assets or issue subordinated debt or other bonds to prevent the government 's stake from rising any higher .
RBS shares closed last night at 18.1 p down 12.5 % .
Brussels is also determined to force Britain to shrink the business of its state - owned or semi-nationalised banks through restructuring schemes as the eventual price for approving the scheme .
Last autumn Neelie Kroes , the EU competition commissioner , and colleagues imposed at least 10 conditions , including stiff charges and a ban on dividends , for sanctioning the government 's £ 250 bn bank recapitalisation scheme .
Kroes 's department is now taking the same approach in negotiations with Whitehall .
Brussels is also considering forcing France to raise the 6 % premium on its € 6bn ( £ 5.3 bn ) loans to its two biggest carmakers .
Renault and PSA Peugeot Citroën .
Britain has been at the forefront of EU countries pressing for early approval on how to define , evaluate and treat toxic assets said to amount trillions of euros in Europe .
Other countries urging a rapid solution in the run-up to an emergency EU summit in Brussels on 1 March are Holland , whose biggest bank ING declared a € 3.7bn loss in the final quarter of 2008 yesterday , and Germany , where the cabinet approved legislation to take banks under full state control .
Britain pressed to be allowed to go ahead with its scheme at last week 's meeting of EU finance ministers .
Subsequent talks at the EU 's economic and financial committee , chaired by senior commission officials and embracing senior treasury officials from all 27 countries , have failed to resolve serious differences , according to insiders .
Countries whose banks are less exposed to toxic assets are mounting the fiercest resistance to the insurance schemes , they added .
The Treasury has yet to submit its proposed insurance scheme , amid suggestions that it is waiting for the commission to issue its final guidance next week .
It said yesterday : " The government has worked very closely with the EU commission on support for financial institutions in the UK and will continue to do so .
There will be further announcements relating to the detail of the asset protection scheme by the end of the month . "
3 Keys to Overcome Porn Addiction Helps with : Porn Addiction Masturbation Addiction Sexual Addiction
Porn Addiction
Porn addiction is one of the most difficult addictions to overcome .
Millions of people around the world struggle with overcoming this powerful vice once they acknowledge they have a problem .
Its been compared to cocaine addiction because of similar neurochemical activity in the brain .
Masturbation Addiction
Some people struggle with a masturbation addiction as well as porn addiction .
Masturbating and reaching climax only strengthens your addiction to porn more .
If you only struggle with only masturbation addiction then you still have a chemical dependency on the brains neurochemicals .
You brain does not see the difference between healthy sex with your spouse and releasing the chemicals yourself .
So you become addicted to the easiest way to release the chemicals which is alone and doing the act far too often in some cases .
How to Overcome These Addictions
Many people reach a point where they need outside assistance to overcome these addictions .
The only problem is not everyone has access to someone who can help nor do they want anyone to know they have this problem .
Of course I have a strong preference when it comes to recovery programs .
The program I found to work the best is completely online and anonymous .
To get started just subscribe for free to the form above or read the review I wrote on the program .
Signs That You or Someone You Know is Addicted
1 . You or the person you know is not being as social as they used to be .
Porn turns us inward and makes us feel emotionally low .
We lose motivation and become less social .
2 . Healthy sex has become less interesting
It can be difficult to be as turned on with normal healthy sex if you have been over - stimulating yourself with porn .
3 . You start needing sex to be more rough or perverse
Porn objectifies and is not about “ making love ” .
Normal sex becomes boring and disconnected .
You need something new and more stimulating , always progressing in perverseness .
4 . You seem distant and disconnected with others
Porn makes us feel uncomfortable with healthy emotionally connected relationships .
We may even feel like we ’re bad people and no one would want to talk to us .
5 . You feel irritable all the time .
Porn does not make us happy people and when we ’re not happy we are irritable and complain about everything .
6 . You ’re not only lying more but you ’re always accusing your partner of things
We treat people like we ’re treating ourselves .
So if we ’re constantly hiding things and feeling guilty then we will treat people in a very defensive manner .
7 . You ’re on the computer all the time and demand privacy
Other than private work matters there are few reasons to be so private about internet use .

THE SPECIAL prosecutor ’s office of Colombia says that it is investigating the deaths of 10 people linked to the killing of a mayor weeks after he had complained of being a marked man to President Alvaro Uribe .
A spokesman for prosecutor Mario Iguaran confirmed the inquiry on Thursday , in a statement three days after the death of Greys del Carmen Tirado .
She was the latest victim tied to the trial of former Sucre governor Salvador Arana , accused of ordering the killing of mayor Eudaldo Diaz .
Also on Thursday , former state congressman Sigifredo Lopez was released by Farc after nearly seven years in captivity .
He was the sixth hostage freed in the latest gesture by Colombia ’s largest rebel group .
Mr Lopez had been in rebel custody since an April 2002 raid on the Cali statehouse , during which he and 11 other state legislators were taken prisoner .
The other legislators were killed in June 2007 , apparently by the leftist rebels in reaction to what they thought was a government rescue operation .
Dr Diaz ( 47 ) , the mayor of El Roble in northern Sucre state , told Mr Uribe before a community meeting in February 2003 that he feared paramilitary groups would carry out their threat to kill him .
Dr Diaz had resisted the militias ’ efforts to take control of El Roble ’s treasury and health system for fear they would loot them , according to his son , Juan David .
Dr Diaz also denounced Mr Arana before Mr Uribe , saying the then - governor backed paramilitary fighters .
Despite the warnings , Dr Diaz was kidnapped , tortured for five days and killed in April of that year .
The mayor was on his way to a meeting supposedly to reconcile with Mr Arana when he was abducted .
Soon after the killing , Mr Arana resigned the governorship and was named Colombian ambassador to Chile by Mr Uribe .
Mr Arana became a fugitive in 2007 after being charged in connection with the slaying .
He was captured last year living in a luxury flat in the Colombian coastal city of Santa Marta .
Ms Tirado was the wife of Edelberto “ El Chino ” Anaya , who is being held along with Mr Arana for alleged involvement in the killing .
She died in a hospital of injuries sustained after she was shot several times in Sincelejo , the state capital of Sucre , by unknown assassins on January 5th .
The attack came days after she approached the Diaz family and said publicly that her husband was prepared to testify in the trial of Mr Arana , which resumes next week in Bogota .
Nine other people have been killed since Dr Diaz ’s death , the prosecutor ’s office said .
The Diaz family ’s lawyer , Rafael Barrios , charged that all were eliminated to prevent testimony potentially damaging to Mr Arana .
Fearing that they wo n’t get a fair trial , Dr Diaz ’s family members have asked the Organisation of American States ’ human rights court to investigate the case .
Among the victims was waiter Diogenes Meza , killed in 2003 after telling police shortly after Dr Diaz was kidnapped that he overheard Mr Arana ’s brother - in - law say he was holding the mayor captive at his ranch and was awaiting the governor ’s instructions .
One of the biggest blows to the prosecution ’s case was the December 23rd killing of Munir Cadavid Haller , a boyhood friend of Dr Diaz and a paramilitary commander who convinced the mayor to meet Mr Arana , apparently not knowing he was helping set the mayor for death .
Mr Cadavid had come forward in recent months to tell police that paramilitary fighters looking to do Mr Arana a favour had killed Dr Diaz to relieve the governor of Dr Diaz ’s criticism and his allegations that the governor was corrupt .

Michael Phelps Apologizes To China At Mazda 's Urging ( Video )
Michael Phelps has issued a second apology for his recent bad behavior .
First he released a written statement , apologizing to his fans throughout the world for the " regrettable " bong incident .
Now he has filmed a formal apology to the people of China .
It appears it is n't so much about his continued remorse as it is an opportunity to cement a new $ 1 million deal with Mazda that prompted the video apology .
The automaker is solidly behind the 23 year old athlete and corporate executives are moving forward with their decision to have him promote their products , with one proviso .
They felt a taped message to Phelps '
Chinese fans was the right move for the athlete and good for the brand .
Mazda released the following statement : " His expression of remorse and his determination to make amends , and especially his video apology and expression of thanks to the Chinese people , give us confidence that Phelps can make a healthy return to the pool and have even more brilliant achievements . "
Check out the new apology video below .

Why are SF and fantasy novels the length they are ?
It 's a question that comes up quite often — back in the 1960s a typical SF novel ran to 60,000 words ( 130 - 150 pages ) ; one that topped 80,000 words was considered lengthy .
But today , I 'm more or less required by contract to hand in 100,000 word novels ; and some of them are considerably longer .
( At 145,000 words , " Accelerando " would have been considered a whopper back in the 1970s . )
So what happened ?
Here 's how one of my editors ( who 's been in the business for close to 40 years ) explained it to me ...
Until the early 1990s , mass market SF / F paperbacks in the US were primarily sold via grocery store racks , supplied by local distributors ( 400 + of them ) .
The standard wire rack held books face - out , either against a wall or on a rotating stand .
And that 's where the short form factor novel became established .
Thinner books meant you could shove more of them into a rack that was , say , three inches deep .
Go over half an inch thick , and you could no longer fit six paperbacks in a 3 " rack .
And there was only so much rack space to go around .
During the inflationary 1970s and early 1980s , prices of just about everything soared .
The publishers needed to increase their cover prices to compensate .
But the grocery wholesalers who sold the books insisted " the product 's gotta weigh more if you want to charge more " .
They were n't in the book business , after all , so just as buffalo tomatoes got bigger , so did paperbacks .
( Even though this meant there was less room to go round in the wire racks . )
You can only get so much milage by using thicker paper and a bigger typeface ; so they began looking for longer novels .
In the 1960s , an SF novel was 60 - 80,000 words , with 80 K being considered overblown and long .
By 1990 they 'd grown to 90 - 100,000 words .
Luckily the word processing revolution came along in the 1990s , making it easier to write and revise longer books .
( A different editor of my acquaintance observed that whenever one of her novelists switched to word processing , the average length of their books increased by about 10 % . )
Then in 1992 or thereabouts Walmart Safeway woke up and said " why the heck are we using eighty bazillion distributors ? " and fired 90 % of them .
The number of grocery distributors in California collapsed from 40 to just 2 ; across the US , 85 % of the distributors went bust or merged .
The mass market book racks imploded as a sales channel .
But that left Barnes and Noble and Borders a market vacuum to fill .
So all was well for a while , with the midlist paperback market replaced by a midlist hardcover market .
But the same length pressure applies : publishers want to get more money per book , and over two decades they had successfully trained their end customers , the readers , to expect fatter books .
So they tried to make the hardbacks bigger .
Finally , circa 2001 , Borders yanked the brake handle and said " we wo n't buy any non-bestselling titles that cost over $ 24 in hardcover or $ 7 in mass market — they 're not selling " .
( Each $ 1 over $ 24 apparently reduced sales turnover by 20 % : new novels by unknown authors simply did n't sell at $ 30 . )
Anyway .
I began selling novels ( in 2001 - 02 ) just as the trend for longer novels peaked .
I 'm actually writing shorter books than my earlier ones — my last two finished manuscripts ran to 102,000 and 107,000 words respectively , whereas my first three SF novels ran to 118,000 , 138,000 and 145,000 words each .
( On the other hand , I 'm not necessarily writing less .
Two bloated 150,000 word behemoths take nearly as long to write as three relatively slim 100,000 word novels , if you 've got your future projects planned out well in advance . )
There 's just one outstanding problem with this Just So tale of publishing folk .
We who read SF / F may have been trained to expect longer books by the grocery distributors , but why have n't mysteries grown the same way ?
It turns out that the average mystery is much the same length that it ever was .
There are exceptions , but they 're obvious as such — you do n't regularly see 400 or 500 page mysteries on the shelves .
I would hypothesize that mysteries did n't succumb to the selection pressure for longer books because there 's a countervailing force at work — the reader 's ability to keep track of multiple characters and plot threads .
If you want to bulk up an SF or fantasy novel , the easy ( and lazy ) way to do it is to add viewpoint characters and plot threads , small stories interleaved within the larger story that shed light on it .
But it 's hard to do that if what you 're trying to hand the reader is a comprehensive set of clues to a fixed scenario , without burying them in a midden of red herrings .
Which leaves stylistic efflorecense ; but a gritty , relatively terse style that has been de rigeur in mystery since Raymond Chandler and Dashiel Hammett — there are exceptions , but florid verbosity is generally frowned upon .
Am I missing anything ?

Jack Straw today said he would take the unprecedented step of vetoing the release of cabinet minutes relating to the decision to invade Iraq .
The justice secretary made his announcement in response to a decision from the information tribunal , which last month ordered the publication of the minutes of two cabinet meetings , held on 13 and 17 March 2003 .
It is the first time the government has used its power to veto the release of documents under the Freedom of Information ( FoI ) Act .
In a statement to MPs , Straw said he had not taken the decision " lightly " .
He added that the public interest in disclosure of the minutes could not " supplant the public interest in maintaining the integrity of our system of government " .
" It is a necessary decision to protect the public interest in effective cabinet government , " he said .
Straw 's decision was supported by the Tories , although the shadow justice secretary , Dominic Grieve , said the government should have made it clear earlier that it was not going to release the minutes .
Under the FoI legislation , the government does not generally have to release information relating to the formulation of policy .
However , the tribunal ruled that this was an exceptional case because of the public interest in knowing what was said as ministers discussed the decision to approval the invasion .
Straw told MPs he disagreed with the tribunal 's findings .
He said confidentiality was most important when the cabinet was discussing the most sensitive issues .
" Cabinet is the pinnacle of the decision - making machinery of government , " Straw said .
" It is the forum in which debates on the issues of greatest significance and complexity are conducted .
" This matter – whether the nation took military action – was indisputably of the utmost seriousness . "
He said he disagreed with the argument that the " momentous " nature of the decision meant the minutes should be made public .
" The convention of cabinet confidentiality and the public interest in its maintenance are especially crucial when the issues at hand are of the greatest importance and sensitivity , " he said .
" Responsibility for cabinet decisions is with the government as a whole , not with individual ministers ... that remains the first principle of the ministerial code .
" If permitted to demonstrate their degree of attachment – or otherwise – to any given policy , ministers could absolve themselves from responsibility for decisions which they have nevertheless agreed to stand by .
" The conventions of cabinet confidentiality and collective responsibility do not exist as a convenience to ministers .
" They are crucial to the accountability of the executive to parliament and the people .
" The concomitant of collective responsibility is that debate is conducted confidentially .
" In short , the damage that disclosure of minutes in this instance would do far outweighs any corresponding public interest in their disclosure . "
Straw said the decision to go to war had already been extensively investigated by a series of official inquiries .
" The decision to take military action has been examined with a fine - toothed comb , " he said .
" We have been held to account for it in this House and elsewhere . "
He also said although 1,500 FoI requests relating to government information had been considered by the information commissioner , the government had not , until now , used its power , under section 53 of the FoI Act , to issue a ministeral veto .
The two cabinet meetings were particularly controversial because they occured at a time when ministers were considering the legality of going to war .
Lord Goldsmith , the attorney general at the time , initially suggested that the legality of the invasion was questionable ,
He subsequently issuing legal advice saying it would be safe for Tony Blair to proceed with the attack .
Campaigners wanted to see the minutes to find out whether this issue had been fully debated by ministers at the time .
Responding to Straw 's statement , Grieve said the decision not to release the minutes " ... classically illustrates what has been wrong with the government 's approach to freedom of information and propaganda " .
Referring to the fact that Straw had been foreign secretary at the time of the invasion , Grieve questioned how it would look to the public " for someone so closely involved in the key decisions now to be personally blocking the release of that information " .
However , he said the Conservatives agreed with the decision .
David Howarth , the Lib Dem justice spokesman , said : " This decision has more to do with preventing embarrassment than with protecting the system of government . "
Like Grieve , he called for a full inquiry into the Iraq war .
Kate Hudson , the chair of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament , said : " This disgraceful decision is yet another attempt to suppress public debate on the biggest political scandal in decades .
" The use of the veto can not be justified in any way – there is no risk to candid discussions in cabinet as such minutes do not single out those making each point .
" We had hoped that , with the withdrawal of the last British troops expected in a matter of months , the government would have released these minutes in preparation for the full inquiry into the Iraq war , long promised by Gordon Brown . "
In its ruling last month , the information tribunal said : " We have decided that the public interest in maintaining the confidentiality of the formal minutes of two cabinet meetings at which ministers decided to commit forces to military action in Iraq did not , at the time when the Cabinet Office refused a request for disclosure in April 2007 , outweigh the public interest in disclosure .
" We have reached that decision by a majority , and not without difficulty .
" We concluded that there was a strong public interest in maintaining the confidentiality of information relating to the formulation of government policy or ministerial communications ( including , in particular , the maintenance of the long - standing convention of cabinet collective responsibility ) .
" However , this is an exceptional case , the circumstances of which brought together a combination of factors that were so important that , in combination , they created very powerful public interest reasons why disclosure was in the public interest . "
A $ 20,000 Homemade Iron Man Costume
I do n’t want to let the state of the economy get me down .
So I do my best to scoff at it .
But what begins with haughty laughter at the latest reports of financial doom usually ends with me crying into a bowl of generic - brand , Honey Nut Happy - O ’s from CostCo .
Norweigan John Kristiansen apparently feels no such pain .
Or he ’s inhaled a few too many fiberglass particles for his own good .
As described in this article from Popular Mechanics , John and his buddies in “ TMP ” set a goal to build a homemade replica of the armor from the Iron Man movie and complete the project before the flick hit theaters last summer .
And $ 20,000 later , they discovered that gobs of money can , in fact , make dreams come true .
Oh , and a little bit of talent for molding ABS plastic and fiberglass probably helped .
But , whatever .
Money is where it ’s at , people .
Cha-ching !
Anyway , things went so well for the project ( which you can track from its inception in the Replica Prop Forums ) that Paramount hired John to promote the Iron Man release in Europe .
( You Tube link . )
And just this week , John released photos of the first pieces of his newest costume replica project , the chrome - plated Iron Man Mark II .
Clearly , his feelings towards the economic crisis have evolved from “ indifferent ” to “ completely oblivious . ”
Is Norway where money comes from or something ?
That would explain a lot , including why I ’ve been having a hard time getting ahold of some .

In order to break the back of the non-violent Greek resistance , an Operation Gladio false flag attack is unfolding in Athens .
“ Unknown gunmen shot and seriously wounded a policeman in Athens on Monday , the second such attack since police shot dead a teenager last month prompting Greece ’s worst riots in decades , ” reports MSNBC .
“ At least two assailants repeatedly fired weapons at a group of riot police guarding the Culture Ministry in the central Athens Exarchia district where the 15 - year - old was killed on Dec. 6 . ”
The political and social rebellion in Greece , directed primarily against the neoliberal bankers and their race to the bottom globalist agenda and known popularly as the " Greek Example , " is proving to be an immense embarrassment for the elite .
Although no one has claimed responsibility for the attack , the Greek government said “ it bore the hallmarks of a Dec. 23 attack on a police bus which a new leftist group said it staged to protest the teenager ’s killing . ”
In that attack , an unidentified man shot at a bus carrying 19 police officers near a university campus in eastern Athens , according to Al Jazeera .
“ A police official , who asked not to be identified , said the shots were believed to come from the campus . ”
Police are forbidden from entering the Athens Polytechnic University .
On November 17 , 1973 , military dictator Georgios Papadopoulos sent the army to crush a demonstration on the university .
A tank crashed through the university gates , killing 24 students .
The Greek military junta of 1967 was engineered by the CIA and NATO .
Following a NATO plan to supposedly neutralize a communist uprising , the Greek military seized the government , declared martial law , and rounded up students , politicians and public figures .
” Martial law , censorship , arrests , beatings , torture , and killings are all part of the cure the colonels have in mind for Greece , ” writes the History of Greece website .
“ The police and soldiers who do the actual torturing do it with impunity , declaring to their victims that they have the USA and NATO behind them . ”
The Greek police and their globalist taskmasters would like to re-enter the university and break the back of the resistance .
“ Conversations with those inside the university revealed a mix of students , older anarchists and immigrants protesting everything from police brutality to globalization to American imperialism , ” the International Herald Tribune reported on December 14 .
“ Administrators say that evicting the anarchists now , especially after the protests of the past week , would entail a police operation they are unwilling to undertake for fear of instigating further violence or destruction . ”
The police are forbidden to enter the university under an asylum law unless invited by administrators .
The political and social rebellion in Greece , directed primarily against the neoliberal bankers and their race to the bottom globalist agenda and known popularly as the “ Greek Example , ” is proving to be an immense embarrassment for the elite .
In order to contrive an excuse to enter the university and destroy the rebellion , it appears agents provocateurs are being dispatched and are now firing on police .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
NATO and the CIA carried out similar covert operations during Operation Gladio .
“ First revealed by Italian Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti in 1991 , Gladio ( from the Latin for “ sword ” ) is still protected to this day by its founding patrons , the CIA and MI6 , ” writes Chris Floyd .
“ Originally set up as a network of clandestine cells to be activated behind the lines in the event of a Soviet invasion of Western Europe , Gladio quickly expanded into a tool for political repression and manipulation , directed by NATO and Washington .
Using right - wing militias , underworld figures , government provocateurs and secret military units , Gladio not only carried out widespread terrorism , assassinations and electoral subversion in democratic states such as Italy , France and West Germany , but also bolstered fascist tyrannies in Spain and Portugal , abetted the military coup in Greece and aided Turkey ’s repression of the Kurds . ”
From Wikipedia :
When Greece joined NATO in 1952 , the country ’s special forces , the LOK ( Lochoi Oreinōn Katadromōn , i.e. “ Mountain Raiding Companies ” ) were integrated into the European stay - behind network .
The CIA and LOK reconfirmed on March 25 , 1955 their mutual co-operation in a secret document signed by US General Trascott for the CIA , and Konstantinos Dovas , chief of staff of the Greek military .
In addition to preparing for a Soviet invasion , the CIA instructed LOK to prevent a leftist coup .
Former CIA agent Philip Agee , who was sharply criticized in the US for having revealed sensitive information , insisted that “ paramilitary groups , directed by CIA officers , operated in the sixties throughout Europe [ and he stressed that ] perhaps no activity of the CIA could be as clearly linked to the possibility of internal subversion . ”
LOK was involved in the CIA engineered military junta of 1967 and a Gladio program known as Operation Sheepskin operated in Greece until 1988 , a fact admitted by the Greek defense minister after Gladio revelations by Italian politician Giulio Andreotti .
Of course , the CIA and NATO do not simply close up shop on successful operations .
A latter day Gladio covert operation is obviously required in Greece due to the success of the rebellion in that country — a popular rebellion against the New World Order and its neoliberal agenda .
The Greek Example will not be allowed to spread across Europe , in particular to Macedonia , Italy , France , where large protests against the WTO and the IMF are gaining momentum and glean inspiration from the rebellion in Greece .
It is particularly crucial at this moment for the banking elite to roll out the tanks and unleash paramilitary police .
In December , the IMF warned of impending economic riots and the U.S. Army War College released a report suggesting the Pentagon would be required to deploy troops inside the United States .
“ Widespread civil violence inside the United States would force the defense establishment to reorient priorities in extremis to defend basic domestic order and human security , ” said the War College report .
In other words , priorities “ in extremis ” will need to be reoriented as millions of people react to the globalist plan to reduce the planet to a slave labor gulag .

We receive many requests for various test results in our articles along with questions as to why this was included but this was not .
We love answering questions ; it is the primary focus of our job .
More often than not , we answer the right ones , sometimes out of sheer luck , but usually we try to cover all the bases within the time allotted .
However , at times we are asked a question that causes us to stop and pause for a moment and wonder why that particular subject was not covered or even mentioned .
One such question arrived in droves after our Phenom II X4 launch articles a couple of weeks ago .
We had to dig through many of the “ You guys always favor Intel and NVIDIA ... ” comments ( for the record we favor performance , quality , and value regardless of supplier ) but after some sifting , we found a pattern in the messages .
Many people wanted more information concerning gaming performance between a Phenom II X4 and similar Core 2 Quad system with specific setups .
We covered these two platforms and more in our Phenom II launch article .
A treasure trove of further information is available in our new Bench database , especially for those who do more than gaming on a computer .
However , the one item mentioned numerous times was the lack of CrossFireX or SLI results compared to a similar Intel based system .
True enough , we have not shown any multi-GPU results on an AMD platform in a long time , especially if you discount the Hybrid results on the uATX chipsets .
One reason has been the lack of compelling CPU performance on the AMD side to drive a dual or triple card setup .
The Phenom tried to take on those duties but with low clock speeds , it failed for the most part .
We think the Phenom II will correct those problems or go a long way in addressing them .
The staff consensus is that the best option for gamers is to purchase the single highest performing graphics card you can afford for your performance requirements and skip the multi-GPU solutions .
This is especially true if you update your system frequently to keep up with the latest games .
Running multi-GPU systems for gaming has other potential negatives ranging from additional cooling and power supply requirements to additional GPU costs , and of course game engine support or more importantly , driver support .
Multi-GPU systems typically require faster processors and system memory to reduce bottlenecks in the rendering / data pipelines .
In addition , running a high - end Cross Fire or SLI solution at resolutions below 1920x1200 is pretty much a waste of resources in most cases , so monitor cost also comes into play .
That short summary sounds like a typical economic report right now ; it ’s all bad and gloomy .
Do not get us wrong , there is a market for Cross Fire / SLI based gaming systems .
Just go to the NVIDIA or AMD websites if you do not believe us .
All kidding aside , for those who have the money , benchmark competitively , or want the absolute best gaming experience with all the game details enabled at ultra- high resolutions , then a multi-GPU solution is probably the correct way to go with the right processor choice .
One exception is Crysis ; we are still waiting for a GPU solution to run that game properly at very high settings with all the eye candy turned on .
Who knows , we might even have a solution for that problem in 2010 .
In the meantime we will try to answer a few questions today about CrossFire performance with the Phenom II X4 940 .
Of course , we might raise more questions than we answer .
If we do , well , those will have to be answered at some point .
Let us discuss the system setup and get to the numbers .
Candice Swanepoel ( born October 20 , 1988 ) is a South African model .
Swanepoel was born in Mooi River , KwaZulu - Natal , and was spotted by a model scout in a Durban flea market at age 15 .
By age 16 , Swanepoel was earning 5,000 Euros or R40,000 for a day 's work .
Swanepoel has appeared on the cover of the Greek edition of Vogue , in advertisements for Nike , and walked the catwalk for Tommy Hilfiger , Victoria 's Secret , and Diane von Fürstenberg .
Rumors said in mid-2008 Swanepoel and Brazilian fellow model Sabrina Jales would be Victoria 's Secret 's newest angels , but the models Marisa Miller and Doutzen Kroes were later chosen instead .

Everybody got this broken feeling
Like their father or their dog just died

Cowards .
That 's the one word that continuously comes to mind when I hear about these out - of - control cops and their tasers .
There have been numerous cases of these weapons being unleashed on harmless victims in recent years , but I think two cases in particular highlight just how cowardly some police have become .
First , we have the ongoing inquiry into Robert Dziekanski's death on the news almost daily , reminding us of how four big , burly , fully - trained cops felt so threatened by a 40 - year - old man holding a stapler that they saw no alternative but to zap him five times with thousands of volts of electricity immediately upon encountering him at Vancouver International Airport back in October 2007 .
And now we have this new case .
A case from last summer in Ontario , which has just come to light in recent days .
A case that involves two cops tasering a 14 - year - old girl inside a jail cell for - wait for it - refusing to stop scratching at the chipped paint on the jail cell wall .
Is there any other word that comes to mind other than " cowards " ?
Because " cowards " really does seem like too weak of a word in this case .
Well , sure , an assault like this one on a 14 - year - old girl certainly does conjure up words like " psychotic " , " mentally unstable " and even " evil " , but I do think " cowardice " is also appropriate .
In the Vancouver airport case , as we 've all seem numerous times on that now - infamous video recording , the four cops did n't even bother trying to restrain Dziekanski , they simply whipped out their tasers and let him have it ... over and over again .
" Cowards " really seems like the perfect word in this case .
Were they scared he might hurt them ?
If so , then it 'd appear that they 're not just cowards but also incompetent and improperly trained .
However , as we all know , they are , in fact , well trained in martial arts and their job description clearly involves being able to handcuff someone when necessary without resorting to the use of weapons .
So , considering the fact that they did n't even try to restrain him and instead went straight for their weapons - for the easiest option - I 'd say they 're not just incompetent , untrained cowards , but lazy as well .
Spare The Taser , Spoil The Paint Job
Now I think we'd all have to agree that a child being tasered for peeling some paint off of a jail cell wall is not only cowardly , but also a clear case of criminal assault .
Not that the cops will ever be punished , of course .
They never are .
When you can get away with killing unarmed 40 - year old men then surely you can torture a little teenage girl if the rage - infused notion so strikes you .
But , sadly , this and the Dziekanski case are only two of the worst - and most publicized - cases .
There are so many other horrible stories out there : Cops tasering people sitting in their cars , tasering people inside jail cells , tasering people already handcuffed in the back seat of patrol cars , tasering people for not immediately responding to a command in a non-violent situation , repeatedly tasering people when they 're already down on the ground .
I 'll say it again :
This is clearly the work of unprofessional , incompetent cowards .
Knee-jerk Apologists For Brutality
Of course this article you 're reading right now , like all others that are provoked by feelings of revulsion and outrage after hearing of yet another case of police brutality , will undoubtedly elicit the typical knee - jerk defensive response from all those either so naive or so completely reactionary that they feel the uncontrollable need to try and excuse even the most horrific cases of police misconduct .
" You do n't know what they have to go through each day " , the knee - jerkers exclaim .
" They risk their lives to keep you safe " , they cry out .
All 100 % irrelevant nonsense , of course .
These people - the police - are paid to PROTECT society , and risking their lives in the line of work is absolutely no excuse for any form of brutality or abuse of power .
But " You do n't know what you would do in such a case .
Put yourself in their shoes " , the apologists bellow , showing an amazing lack of concern for the victims .
Well , I can tell you one thing with absolute certainty and that 's that I would never be able to live with myself if I ever acted in such a brutal , cowardly manner .
Good Cops
These tasering - at - the - slightest - provocation cops can't make anyone proud .
Not their families , not society at large , not even their knee - jerk defenders ... and certainly not all the decent cops out there .
And , believe me , there are indeed lots of good cops out there who are sickened by all of this ; cops who know how to do their job without brutalizing anyone ; cops who take pride in their work ; cops willing and able to restrain a 40 - year - old man without pulling out their weapons , especially when accompanied by three big strong colleagues .
We all know that these good cops are out there on the job in every community , so why would anyone feel so compelled to come to the defense of those who are so obviously not good and decent ?
Well , it would seem that the kneeejerkers would want us to believe that all police are good , decent , honest human beings , and that the real problem is not police brutality but rather the media .
" How can the media publicize these awful , outlandish , slanderous stories of abuse and misconduct ? " , they ask .
" No police officer would ever behave in such an unprofessional manner " .
Now that 's obviously just ridiculous , is n't it ?
Everybody Knows
Everybody knows that there are sinister , horrific cops out there , particularly in places such as North Korea , Zimbabwe , Iran , Russia , China , Los Angeles , New York , etc .
Everybody knows about the case from a few years back of the New York cops convicted of torturing a suspect by ramming a toilet plunger up his ass , rupturing his intestines .
Everyone knows about the Rodney King case .
Everyone knows about the dreadful history of the horrifically racist cops in the American Deep South who tormented , framed and even murdered African Americans right up until a few decades ago .
And this list could go on forever .
Bad cops do indeed exist ( just like corrupt politicians and businessmen ) .
So why is it so hard , I wonder , for some people here in Canada to accept that they also exist in our country ?
Perhaps these apologists are unaware of those corrupt narc squad cops in Toronto who were selling drugs and beating the shit out of people earlier this decade .
Perhaps they 're unaware of the numerous reported cases involving cops in the Prairies dropping off Natives on the outskirts of town in the middle of minus - 40 - degree winter nights .
And perhaps they have n't heard of the recent case of the two off - duty cops charged with assaulting and robbing that poor guy in downtown Vancouver last month .
And perhaps they have n't read about the hundreds of other police brutality cases here in Canada over the years .
Perhaps they can't read ?
I do n't know .
But you 'd at least think they'd know how to watch the news .
Seriously , these apologists are a bit ludicrous .
They 're kind of like the few remaining people who claim that there 's no problem with sexual abuse of children in the Catholic Church .
Not only in their denial of the obvious , but also in their feigning of outrage that anyone would even suggest such a thing .
Respect
The way I see it , anyone who truly respects the police would want these cowards within their ranks immediately removed from the force so that all those cops brave and competent enough to do their jobs properly could go about their work in a professional manner ... and in so doing earn the respect and trust of the whole community .
Seriously , who wants the cowards kept on the job smearing the reputation of the whole force ?
Sadly , the answer seems to be not just the apologists out in the public , but also the police forces themselves , particularly the RCMP .
There clearly seems to be some sort of internal police code that involves doing everything possible to help any and all fellow officers escape punishment , no matter how terrible their behavior .
In other words they 're smearing their own names .
As one person asked in a comment left in response to my earlier piece on the Robert Dziekanski case , And Injustice For All : Cops Face No Charges In Death of Robert Dziekanski , " Where are the Mounties I grew up to respect ? "
Another very interesting comment - one that I think everyone should read - was posted in response to that same article by a former police officer , a cop who 's just as appalled by police brutality as almost everyone else out there ... and actually did something to try and stop it .
Too Much To Ask ?
So , think about it police forces of Canada ( and any and all apologists for police brutality out there ) , would n't it in fact be far more logical and productive for you to perhaps consider working for the removal of all the incompetent brutal cowards within your ranks , rather than defending them at all costs ?
I mean , seriously , why not champion a courageous , competent , professional police force ?
Something that could indeed be a reality here in Canada someday ... if only the prosecutors , apologists and the police themselves refrained from blocking any and all attempts to bring the cowards to justice and get them removed from the force .
Accountability , professionalism , competence , bravery and an end to violent attacks on newly - arrived immigrants and 14 - year - old girls , among others - is it really too much to ask from those paid to protect us ?

It shut down his Capitol Hill office earlier this week , and a Senate source provides Mother Jones with a copy of an updated phone list ( pdf ) sent out Thursday by the Sargeant - at - Arms that makes no mention of the mostly - defeated Coleman .
Coleman ’s term officially expired over the weekend , and Al Franken has n’t been sworn in , meaning that Minnesota has only one senator on the list .
Matt Smith was today named as the new Doctor Who , the BBC said , becoming the 11th Time Lord since the programme first aired in 1963 .
Mr Smith will replace David Tennant at the helm of the Tardis , and is due to first appear on our screens as the revered doctor in 2010 .
Smith , 26 , is the youngest ever doctor and although relatively unknown , has appeared in Alan Bennett 's play The History Boys at the National Theatre in London , and alongside Christian Slater in Swimming with Sharks in the West End .

He said he was delighted to take on the role .
He explained : " I 've got this wonderful journey in front of me .
I 've got six months to build this Time Lord and that 's such an exciting prospect . "
Smith was unveiled live on BBC1 and with the broadcast beamed live on BBC big screens nationwide .
He added : " I 'm just so excited about the journey that is in front of me .
It 's a wonderful privilege and challenge that I hope I will thrive on .
" I feel proud and honoured to have been given this opportunity to join a team of people that has worked so tirelessly to make the show so thrilling .
" David Tennant has made the role his own , brilliantly , with grace , talent and persistent dedication .
I hope to learn from the standards set by him .
" The challenge for me is to do justice to the show 's illustrious past , my predecessors , and most importantly , to those who watch it .
I really cannot wait . "
Tennant announced in October last year that he would be stepping down from his role as the doctor at the end of this year .
The fifth series of the much - loved sci - fi hit will also have a new lead writer and executive producer with Bafta award - winning writer Steven Moffat taking over from Russell T Davies .
Moffat will be joined by Piers Wenger , who will be the new executive producer for BBC Wales making the show .
Wenger , head of drama at BBC Wales , added : " With two hearts , a ferocious mind and over 900 years of experience behind him , it 's not every 26 - year - old actor who can take on a role like the Doctor but within moments of meeting Matt he showed the skill and imagination needed to create a Doctor all of his own .
" It 's just the beginning of the journey for Matt but with Steven Moffat 's scripts and the expertise of the production team in Cardiff behind him , there is no - one more perfect than him to be taking the Tardis to exciting new futures when the series returns in 2010 . "
Four Doctor
Who specials featuring Tennant will run in 2009 into New Year 2010 before Smith appears on our screens .
Tennant told the Doctor Who Confidential programme : " It 's funny really , as I begin the end of my connection to all of this I do feel a bit of jealousy of Matt who 's kind of just about to start and has got all off this ahead of him and it's a very exciting journey to go on . "
The identity of the new Doctor has been strictly guarded by the BBC .
Favourites for the role had changed seemingly week - in week - out as more and more actors ' names were put forward by the media .
David Morrissey , Catherine Zeta Jones , Martin Clunes and even David Walliams were amongst others mooted for the part .
But Smith finally won the prized role and said he was still in a state of shock following his appointment .
He explained : " I 'm flabbergasted , I have n't slept really to be honest . "
He added : " It 's an iconic part of our culture , my grandad knows about it , my dad knows about it , it 's been going since 1963 it has the iconic status of Robin Hood or Sherlock Holmes . "
Moffat who helped chose the new Doctor said he knew Smith was perfect to fill Tennant 's boots as soon as he saw him .
He explained : " The Doctor is a very special part , and it takes a very special actor to play him .
You need to be old and young at the same time , a boffin and an action hero , a cheeky schoolboy and the wise old man of the universe .
" As soon as Matt walked through the door , and blew us away with a bold and brand new take on the Time Lord , we knew we had our man . "
( CNN ) --
A woman who was beheaded near Buffalo , New York -- allegedly by her husband -- may have been on the phone with her sister when she was killed .
Muzzammil Hassan has been charged with second - degree murder in the death of his wife , Aasiya Zubair Hassan .
Asma Firfirey of suburban Cape Town , South Africa , told the Afrikaans newspaper Die Burger that she was on the phone with her sister , Aasiya Zubair Hassan , last week when she heard Hassan tell her husband to calm down .
She said she heard Hassan say the two could talk about their impending divorce the following day .
Then she heard something that sounded like her sister struggling to breathe , she said .
" I can only imagine how scared and emotional she must have been before she died , " Firfirey said in the interview , reported in English by South Africa 's News 24 .
Police have charged Hassan 's husband , Muzzammil Hassan , with second - degree , or intentional , murder in the death of his wife , according to the Erie County District Attorney 's Office .
Her decapitated body was found at the offices of Bridges TV , the television network where Muzzammil Hassan was chief executive officer and Aasiya Hassan was general manager .
Hassan told Orchard Park police his wife was dead , led officers to her body and was arrested Thursday , said Erie County District Attorney Frank Sedita III .
He is scheduled to appear in court Wednesday .
Orchard Park Police Chief Andrew Benz on Tuesday contradicted a CNN report that quoted him as saying Hassan confessed to the crime .
A Buffalo attorney told CNN on Tuesday that he expects to represent Hassan but declined further comment , saying details had not yet been worked out .
Hassan came to America from Pakistan 25 years ago and became a successful banker , but he and his wife were troubled by the negative perception of Muslims , Voice of America reported in 2004 .
Speaking in December 2004 , Hassan said his wife , then pregnant , was worried about that perception and " felt there should be an American Muslim media where her kids could grow up feeling really strong about their identity as an American Muslim . "
" So she came up with the idea and turned to me and said , ' Why do n't you do it ? ' " he said .
" And I was like , I have no clue about television .
I 'm a banker .
...
And her comment was , ' You have an MBA .
Why do n't you write a business plan ? ' "
Bridges TV began as a television network for Muslim - Americans , aimed at overcoming the negative stereotypes associated with the religion .
" There should be a Muslim media , " Muzzammil Hassan told VOA , " so that Muslim children growing up in America grow up with the self - confidence and high self - esteem about their identity both as Americans and as Muslims . "
In the past few years , according to a former employee who asked not to be named for fear of retribution , Bridges TV transformed itself into more of a cross-cultural network seeking to bridge the gap between all cultures .
Most of their employees were not Muslim , the former employee said , and Muzzammil Hassan himself was not devout .
Aasiya Hassan filed for divorce February 6 , police said , and Muzzammil Hassan was served with divorce papers at the station .
That night , he showed up at the couple 's home , she notified authorities and he was served with a restraining order .
Police are not commenting on details of the crime , except to say the woman 's body did not appear to have been moved .
They also would not divulge what Muzzammil Hassan told police or the suspected motive .
The law firm representing Aasiya Hassan refused to comment , only confirming that she had filed for divorce .
Benz told CNN on Tuesday that police had responded to several domestic violence calls at the couple 's address , but no one was arrested .
Firfirey , as well as a Pakistani woman identifying herself as another of Aasiya Hassan 's sisters , characterized her as living in fear .
Firfirey said the last time she saw her sister was in May 2008 , when she visited South Africa .
When she arrived , she was badly injured , and Firfirey 's family paid the equivalent of about $ 3,000 for her to be treated , she said .
Aasiya Hassan returned to America , she said , because she wanted to complete her MBA degree and " did n't want to leave her children with that monster . "
She said she calls Muzzammil Hassan " the fat man with evil eyes . "
Aasiya Hassan would have graduated March 6 , Firfirey said .
A woman in Pakistan using the name Salma Zubair posted on a blog that she is the sister of " this brutally murdered woman . "
" She lived her 8 years of married life with fear in heart , " Zubair wrote .
" He had already frightened her enough that she could n't muster up her guts and leave him , and when she finally did gather that much strength he killed her so brutally .
She lived to protect her children from this man and his family and she died doing so . "
She said Aasiya Hassan " had always been a very loving person , not even one person in this world can say a small wrong word about her ... she had always dreamed a life of a happily married family , which she did her best to achieve . "
Both women said they were worried about the couple 's children , ages 4 and 6 .
Firfirey said they were being cared for by a colleague of the couple .
Muzzammil Hassan also has two older children from a previous marriage .
Members of Muzzammil Hassan 's family did not return calls from CNN on Monday .
The former employee told CNN that Aasiya Hassan was popular at the station and was very kind .
Muzzammil Hassan was known among employees for having a temper -- he sometimes would yell at and demean his wife , but at other times appeared to be a loving husband and father , the former employee said .
Bridges TV released a statement Monday saying its staff was " deeply shocked and saddened by the murder of Aasiya Hassan and the subsequent arrest of Muzzammil Hassan .
Our deepest condolences and prayers go out to the families of the victim . "
Imam Mohamed Hagmagid Ali , vice president of the Islamic Society of North America , said Aasiya Hassan 's death serves " as a wake - up call to call of us , that violence against women is real and cannot be ignored ... the Muslim community is not exempt from this issue .
We , the Muslim community , need to take a strong stand against domestic violence . "
CNN 's Mary Snow contributed to this report .

Over the weekend , a picture of Michael Phelps smoking a bong was made public .
What 's the big deal ?
It 's not like he 's the first ( or last ) celeb to toke .

This morning on The View , Elisabeth Hasselbeck was all bent out of shape about Phelps ' bong hit , giving the tired spiel about how he 's a role model and he 's setting a bad example , blah blah blah .
She went on to claim that since he 's willing to use illegal drugs to have a good time , maybe he 's open to using illegal drugs to advance his career , as though weed is a gateway drug to steroids or something .
Whoopi shot her down pretty quickly , and admitted to enjoying pot .
Elisabeth 's argument hinged on the fact that Phelps accepts money to endorse products .
One of those is Rosetta Stone , the language - learning software , which is just about one of the most sedentary activities a stoner could enjoy , aside from watching The Wizard of Oz on mute while playing The Dark Side of the Moon .
( I should know , since I 've been using the program to learn Spanish . )
His other sponsors , like Omega and Speedo , totally do n't give a shit .

And they should n't , because it 's silly - in my opinion , anyway - to pass judgment on those who take part in something as innocuous as pot smoking , which many believe is lot less harmful for one 's body than alcohol .
Besides , despite the fact that it 's technically illegal , so many people smoke weed recreationally that it 's not all that taboo .
Here 's a list of celebrities who have either been caught smoking marijuana , or admit willingly to doing so .
Woody Harrelson
Woody is an activist for the legalization of marijuana and hemp .

If you ’re a blogger , by now you have already found out that the majority of your blog ’s traffic comes from search engines and social media & bookmarking sites .
There is a lot of information available on any of these two traffic sources to help you get started in either optimization you choose to make , although I would suggest you do both , to diversify your incoming traffic .
I know that for many start - up bloggers , the blogs they manage are probably the first contact they had with a website from the role of an administrator , and surely the first contact they had with the concept of SEO ( Search Engine Optimization ) .
In terms of blog optimization , I have shared with you a few articles in the past that offer a good range of blog SEO tips , so , in case you need to refresh your memory , feel free to go through them again .
The problem is that even with the available information , those new to the concept of SEO tend to try anything and everything , without taking the time to decide what ’s best and what could actually damage their rankings .
In what follows I ’m going to present a list of the top SEO mistakes you must avoid .
SEO Mistake # 1 – Ignoring Basic Search Engine Guidelines
From my point of view , this is the biggest mistake a SEO beginner could make .
SEO is a set of actions meant to improve search engine rankings , so the most important thing would obviously be to first check out the targeted search engines ’ quality and submission guidelines .
Here are the links to the guides of two of the most important search engines , Google and Yahoo :
Google SEO & Quality Guidelines
Yahoo SEO Guidelines
Any further SEO actions you take should abide by the above guidelines .
After all , is their “ approval ” you ’re seeking .
SEO Mistake # 2 – Not Having a Keywords Strategy
There is one common mistake that people do and it ’s about the way they understand the concept of using keywords .
Keywords are not what you would want you ’re website to be found for , but what your website could show up for in relation to its content .
I ’ve seen hundreds of websites with that keywords META filled with the most incredible and unrelated words and phrases , most times on the homepage .
It ’s a mistake to target numerous keywords and actually diminishing that chances to succeed with either one of them .
The development of a keyword strategy is done in strong relationship with your blog ’s structure .
Just like your blog ’s homepage is a gateway to more detailed content topics , so should be its keywords and the keywords of its subpages , categories and posts .
Focus on choosing keywords that go hand in hand with the actual content and topics you approach rather than keywords that you ’d think might be representative .
Work from your homepage downward in your blog structure , going from more general keywords , to very specific keywords as you get to the posts , like in the diagram below :
Here are 3 past articles you might find useful when it comes to developing and maintaining a keyword strategy :

Advantages of Long Tail Keywords Optimization
SEO Mistake # 3 – Ignoring the title tags ( H1 , H2 , H3 , H4 … )
When writing and publishing blog posts , many ignore these HTML heading tags .
You ’ve probably seen that I use them in most of my posts , and not only for optimization reasons .
They also help your readers better follow the post ’s structure and ideas .
Use appropriate keywords inside these tags .
The search engine bots give special attention to these headings and continue to “ read ” your content based on the information found inside them .
It builds up relevancy .
Also , a look at how your theme uses heading tags , SEO wise , would do good too .
SEO Mistake # 4 –
Too much focus on one of the optimization elements
Due to not filtering the incoming information on SEO , some people make the mistake on focusing too much on optimizing the meta tags , or the titles , or the body text of posts .
Optimization is a process that should cover all aspects in a very close relationship .
Once you ’ve decided which keywords to use , make sure you optimize your page title , META ’s , subheading , body text , links , alternate ( ALT ) text on images and so on .
The more consistent the whole page looks in terms of optimization , the better the chances of a higher ranking .
SEO Mistake # 5 – SEO is Not a One Time Process
No Sir , it ’s not !
It ’s a matter of trial and error , of research and observation of evolution .
Do n’t make the mistake of resting at peace once you ’ve finished optimizing a page or website .
Check the results from time to time , adjust your keyword strategy if necessary .
You do n’t have to do this only because search engines change algorithms .
You have to do it also because you ’re definitely not the only one targeting those keywords , assuming you ’re targeting competitive ones – otherwise , what ’s the point ?
Research -> Analize -> Experiment .
It ’s the only path to success , in any field .
The Simpsons has used and coined many neologisms for humorous effect , many of which are only used once .
The most famous example is Homer Simpson 's signature annoyed grunt , " D'oh ! " .
Few of the following made - up words would qualify as neologisms from a strict lexicological perspective due to their extremely limited uses outside of the show .
For those that have found their way into regular and common use , the route passes through the considerable fan - base where use of these words carries the prestige of pop-culture literacy among those who catch the references , just as among other cultural groups a clever parallel to a well - known phrase from the literary or rhetorical canon would be acknowledged .
The following is presented , then , as a glossary of words or phrases invented by the show which one or more characters use in regular speech , as though intended as real terms .
This does not include names of characters , locations , or products .
Letters : A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z
A
Absotively notarino
A jokey way of saying " definitely not " .
" Absotively " is a portmanteau of " absolutely " and " positively " .

In " Hurricane Neddy " , Dr. Foster asks a younger Ned Flanders if he feels angry , to which the younger Ned replies uncertainly , " Absotively notarino " .
Adultivity
The state or condition of being an adult .

A joke version of the word " ask " .
In Flanders ' Book of Faith , the Q&A section is called " Askaroonie the Nedster " .
Assal Horizontology
A term for a medical procedure coined by Dr. Nick Riviera in " King - Size Homer . "
Homer Simpson tries to gain weight to get on workers ' compensation .
While prescribing a diet consisting of a steady gorging process for Homer , Dr. Nick suggests that it be combined with assal horizontology .
Presumably , he means lying down - or more likely , sitting on your ass in an almost horizontal position .
It is also possible that he means to gain so much weight that it causes Homer 's ass to expand horizontally .
Avoision
Kent Brockman 's conflation of the words avoidance and evasion in " Bart the Fink . "
When corrected through his earpiece , Brockman responds to them on - air : " I do n't say evasion , I say avoision . "
This is a reference to a William Shatner outtake where he argues with his director over the pronunciation of the word " sabotage " : " You say sab - oh - TAHGE .
I say sab - oh - TAGE " ( rhyming with the word badge ) .
The term avoision originated in the literature of the anti-taxation movement in the U.S. in the 1970s ; it was coined to get around laws against advocating or providing advice relating to tax evasion .
B
Bagzooka
A bazooka that fires beanbags , as used by Lou in Lisa the Tree Hugger .
Banjologist
An expert in banjo based musical styles .
In the episode " Home Away from Homer " , Lisa listens to a radio program on obscure music , and hears the host refer to a guest as a banjologist , using " - ology " as the suffix for the study of a subject ( or sometimes the subject itself , although this is technically incorrect ) .
Bartesque
An invented French word that means " being like Bart " ( i.e. , mischievous ) .
Bart :
But it involves being a bit underhanded , a bit devious , a bit , as the French say , " Bartesque " .

Episode : " Midnight Towboy " .

Beginulate

Its use appears in the " Treehouse of Horror XV " short In the Belly of the Boss :
Frink : " Let the commencement … beginulate ! "
Beheadbumped
Bumped on the head .
Used in " The Wettest Stories Ever Told , " when Ned Flanders is knocked unconscious by Homer 's bowling ball from the roof .
Bembarassed
A mispronunciation of " embarrassed " spoken by Ralph Wiggum in " Smart and Smarter " .
Bemusement Park
An amusement park that bemuses instead of amuses .
Coined by Ned Flanders in " I'm Goin ' to Praiseland . "
Ned : Oh , Maude , I 've turned your dream of a Christian amusement park into a be-musement park .
Homer : Do n't say that , Ned !
Ned :
It is !
It 's a bemusement park !
The phrase might also be intended as a play on letter grading from A - musement to B- musement ( as in B - movie ) .
Whereas " B- musement " suggests the park is second rate and explains his strong spoken emphasis of the letter " b " , " bemusement " suggests the attendees simply fail to understand the religious park 's message .
Betsy Bleedingheart
A person or organization who tries to get sympathy with the public , after the epithet " bleeding - heart liberal " .
Mr. Burns :
A non-profit organization with oil ; I wo n't allow it !
An oil well does n't belong in the hands of some Betsy Bleedingheart or Maynard G. Muskievote !

They typed " It was the best of times , it was the blurst of times " to the disappointment of Mr. Burns .
Bolognium
An element on a highly inaccurate periodic table at Springfield Elementary .
Due to their inability to afford an accurate table , they have to make do with a promotional one from meat company Oscar Mayer , which advertises their product in the information .
The atomic weight of Bolognium is known to be either " delicious " or " snacktacular " .
The real element in that space in the periodic table is molybdenum and the atomic weight is 95.95 .
The name is presumably derived from polonium , element 84 .
Bonus Eruptus
A medical condition coined by Dr. Nick Riviera that is described as " a terrible condition where the skeleton tries to leap out of the mouth and escape the body " in " 22 Short Films About Springfield " .
The term came to be when a frantic Abe Simpson demanded to see a quack .
Abe 's symptoms included being " edgy " , having " ants in his pants " and being " discombobulated " .
Dr. Nick also warned Grandpa that if he did n't calm down to receive treatment , Grandpa would give himself skin failure .
Dr. Nick 's prescribed treatment for Bonus Eruptus was " Trans- dental Electromicide , " which called for a golf - cart motor and a 1000 - volt " capacimator " .
High voltage is applied to the patient 's teeth , presumably until they are either cured or dead .
This is a reference to the common cartoon trope of a skeleton escaping a character 's mouth in fright , and possibly a reference to the Ray Bradbury short story " Skeleton " .
Boostafazoo
Physical punishment or comeuppance .
Bart : Burns needs some serious boostafazoo , right Dad ?
Boo-urns
What Smithers tells Burns the angry movie audience is saying after a screening of his film " A Burns for All Seasons " .

Smithers , ever the yes - man , replies that they are saying " boo-urns " ( i.e. " Burns " ) , and not " boo " .
When Burns asks for clarification , the crowd replies that they are indeed saying " boo " , and not " boo-urns " .
After the crowd replies , Hans Moleman says that , in fact , he was saying " boo-urns " .
Hans Moleman : I was saying " boo-urns … " note :
Has been heard chanted in UCLA 's Paulley Pavilion , cynically , when the basketball team is performing below expectations .

Brassafrax
Presumably an extremely antiquated cry of submission ( as in " Uncle ! " ) used by Montgomery Burns 's mother in the episode " Homer the Smithers " .
When Smithers wants to regain Burns 's trust , he tells Homer to call Burns 's mother and transfer the call to his office .
Smithers 's plan is to rush in and rescue Burns from what will certainly be an awkward phone conversation .
Smithers : Hello , Mrs. Burns ?
This is Waylon Smithers .
I have your son Montgomery on the line ...
Mrs. Burns :
That improvident lackwit ?
Always too busy stridin ' about his atom mill to call his own mother .
I 'll give him what - fors till he cries brassafrax !
Bumbled - bee
One of Mr. Burns ' seemingly antiquated alternative expressions referring to an existing term ( similar to " iced cream " , the original name for ice cream ) .

I could get stung by a bumbled - bee ! "
C
California Cheeseburger
A sandwich with a baby in the middle , first seen in " The Secret War of Lisa Simpson . "
Chief Wiggum shows a group of touring kids a museum display of a hippie couple who are getting stoned and ready to take a bite of the " California Cheeseburger . "
Capdabbler
A word made up by Mr. Burns in " Last Exit to Springfield " for a song parodying Dr. Seuss 's " The Grinch " :
" Look at them all , through the darkness I 'm bringing
They 're not sad at all .
They 're actually singing !
They sing without juicers
They sing without blenders
They sing without flungers , capdabblers and smendlers ! "
Car Hole
A common man 's term for garage , coined by Moe Szyslak in " The Springfield Connection " .
While " Car Hole " appears only twice in the series itself , it is often used by fans to jokingly refer to a garage , or garage - like structure .
The phrase first appears in a conversation between Moe Szyslak and Homer Simpson , wherein Moe ridicules Homer for his use of the overly formal word , " garage " .
Homer : Hmm .
I wonder why he 's so eager to go to the garage ?
Moe :
The " garage " ?
Hey fellas , the " garage " !
Well , ooh la di da , Mr. French Man .
Homer :
Well what do you call it ?
Moe : A car hole !
The phrase appears once more as Homer expresses his shock upon discovering a counterfeit jeans outfit has ( inexplicably ) taken up operation in his garage .
Homer : [ gasps ]
A counterfeit jeans ring operating out of my car hole !
Chazwazer
A fictitious Australian name for the bullfrog .
As the Simpsons depart from Australia , an Australian equivalent of Squeaky - Voiced Teen asks what the strange creature infesting his home country is called .
Upon receiving its proper name , he responds , " What ?
That 's an odd name .
I 'd have called them chazwazers . "
Cheese - eating surrender monkey
A satirical and insulting phrase , referring to the collaborationist Vichy France regime 's surrender in World War II .
Groundskeeper Willy ( teaching French class ) : " Bonjourrrrrr , you cheese - eating surrender monkeys ! "
Chestal
Of , or relating to , the chest .
Bart : I 'm all tense through the chestal area !
The word " chestal , " in this sense , first became popular in the 1960s when Woody Allen used it in one of his stand - up comedy routines .
It then appeared in the episode " Bart 's Girlfriend " .
Also used : " neckal " and " scalpal " .
Chester A. Arthuritis
A condition resulting from excitement over studying President Chester A. Arthur .
Upon discovering Jebediah Springfield 's past as Hans Sprungfeld , Lisa nervously jokes about having just gotten over her " Chester A. Artuhritis " before coming down with " Jebeditis " .
Professor Hurlbut : " Looks like you 've come down with a serious case of Jebeditis . "
Lisa : " Just as I was getting over my Chester A. Arthuritis . "
Professor Hurlbut : " Heh heh ... y- you had arthritis ? "
Chimpan - A
An ape .
In a musical based on The Planet of the Apes , Troy McClure 's character claimed that he hated all apes from " chimpan - A to chimpanzee " , as a pun on chimpanzee and the phrase " A to Z " .
Chocotastic
One of the three neglected food groups , along with the Whipped group and the Congealed group , that Homer must concentrate on eating more of in " King - Size Homer " .
This word has made its way into international culture , as there are Pop - Tarts available in The Netherlands and elsewhere in Europe with the flavor of Chocotastic .
( Coincidentally , in the episode , Riviera recommends that Homer use Pop - Tarts to replace bread in sandwiches . )
Clouseauesque
A combination of excessive clumsiness and ridiculously bad luck , in the manner of Peter Sellers ' hapless Inspector Jacques Clouseau .
From the episode " The Boy Who Knew Too Much " .
The French waiter , who accused Freddy Quimby of attacking him , says in the court room , " This is an outrage !
I am not a clumsy clouseauesque waiter ! "
He then falls out of the window into an open truck of rat traps .
Cohuhtage Cheese
Bart 's mispronunciation of " cottage cheese " in " The Heartbroke Kid " .
Bart was unaware of many healthy foods such as this when he was forced to live a less unhealthy lifestyle , and he consequently had no idea how to pronounce the food .
Commie - Nazi
Fictional villains Rainier Wolfcastle faces in one of his McBain movies .
While delivering UNICEF pennies to " the puny children who need them " , McBain 's airplane is attacked .
He picks up the radio and says , " McBain to base , under attack by Commie - Nazis . "
These " Commie - Nazis " combine Communism and Nazi ideology , and use a mix of the Swastika and Hammer and Sickle on a red background as their standard .
This phrase has long precedent in the form of " Commu - Nazi " as used by Walter Winchell .
However , many viewers believe that this is simply a combination of two over - used action movie villains .
It may also be a reference to the Superman comics during World War II pitting the superhero against the " Japanazis " , a cross between America 's two principal enemies in the war .
Crantastic
A reference to an Ocean Spray advertising device , a portmanteau of cranberry and fantastic .
Said by the squeaky - voiced teen as he is swept away by a tide of cranberry juice in " Homer and Apu " .
Crap factory
Invented by Bart as a dysphemism for " stomach " after Nelson takes exception to his saying " tummy . "
Bart : " It 's my tummy ! " ( Nelson glares at him ) " I mean stomach !
Gut! Crap factory ! "
Craptacular
A portmanteau of " crap " and " spectacular . "
" Craptacular " was used by Bart to describe the supposedly defective Christmas lights that Homer purchased in " Miracle on Evergreen Terrace " .
It is one of the more frequently used made - up words from The Simpsons , and , like a few others , was in use before The Simpsons popularized it .
Currently used for a yearly contest on the Howard Stern show , where contestants eat and eat then weigh their waste over 24 hours .
Crayola Oblongata
The procedure of putting a crayon into the brain via the nasal cavity , a portmanteau of crayon producing company Crayola and the part of the brainstem called the medulla oblongata .
Crisitunity
A portmanteau created by Homer when Lisa tells him that the Chinese have the same word for " crisis " and " opportunity " .
The actual Chinese words for those terms are different but share a common character ( 危機 for " crisis " and 機會 for " opportunity " ) .
From " Fear of Flying " .
Cromulent
A word meaning valid or acceptable , coined by David X. Cohen for the Simpsons episode " Lisa the Iconoclast " .
When schoolteacher Edna Krabappel hears the Springfield town motto " A noble spirit embiggens the smallest man , " she comments she 'd never heard of the word embiggens before moving to Springfield .
Miss Hoover replies , " I do n't know why ; it 's a perfectly cromulent word " .
Later in the same episode , while talking about Homer 's audition for the role of town crier , Principal Skinner states " He 's embiggened that role with his cromulent performance . "
Based on the context in which Miss Hoover uses the word cromulent , we can interpret that she intends it to mean " legitimate " , " applicable " or " appropriate . "
Principal Skinner seems to use it to mean " more than acceptable " or " more than adequate " ; these usages would also ( in an assumed lexical context ) satisfy Miss Hoover 's use of the word .
Perhaps both characters intend it to mean " authentic " , which would validate both uses of the word ( e.g. " it 's a perfectly authentic word " and " he embiggened that role with his authentic performance " ) .
The word has a sort of recursive irony about it : as a made - up word it possesses none of the qualities that it describes .
Both " embiggen " and " cromulent " were quickly adopted and used by Simpsons fans .
" Cromulent " has taken on an ironic meaning , to say that something is not at all legitimate and in fact spurious .
Indeed , the DVD commentary for " Lisa the Iconoclast " makes a point of reinforcing that " embiggen " and " cromulent " are completely made up by the writers and have since taken on a life of their own via the Internet and other media .
In the 2005 Xbox game Jade Empire , the player meets a British - colonialist - styled outsider who uses made - up mispronounced words .
When the player confronts the man with this , the man claims that one of the words he used was " cromulent " .
" Cromulent " has since appeared in Webster 's New Millennium Dictionary of English ( lookup via reference.com ) .
Some sources have misheard the word as " promulent " .
Crotch dot
A red dot that appears on one 's crotch , and is thought to be fatal ( Chief Wiggum 's uncle died of Crotch Dot ) .
Seymour Skinner was suspected of having this disease , although in reality , it was a laser pointer used as a prank by Bart .
From " The Dad Who Knew Too Little " .
Compare to " crotch rot " , a slang term for jock itch .
Chief Wiggum : " Hey , you better get that red dot checked out ; my uncle died of crotch dot ! "
D
Dash Hole
Another name for the cigarette lighter power socket .
This name was used by the automotive appliance salesman when asking Homer what he had plugged into his Dash Hole .

Debigulator
A device for shrinking a person to microscopic size .
A Professor Frink - like character uses the debigulator to shrink Lisa to microscopic size in " The Genesis Tub " , one of the stories in " Treehouse of Horror VII " .
Deceleratrix
The service brakes on a car .
Mr. Burns attempts to drive a car for the first time while proclaiming he is sure the owners ' manual will instruct him as to which lever is the velocitator and which one is the deceleratrix .
The word is formed by changing the word " decelerator " from the Latin masculine to feminine .
From " Homer the Smithers "
Dickety
Grandpa Simpson 's made - up word for the number twenty in the episode " Raging Abe Simpson and His Grumbling Grandson in " The Curse of the Flying Hellfish " . "
Abe : Now , my story begins in nineteen - dickety - two .
We had to say " dickety " ' cause the Kaiser had stolen our word " twenty " .
I chased that rascal to get it back , but gave up after dickety - six miles …
The word may have a faux " old timer " feel because of its similarity to the words " dicker " and lickety as in " lickety split . "
" Dicker " is a word for " bargain " that 's sometimes associated with rural or antiquated settings .
In the Latin American Spanish dub the word used is " tijiri " , which has no actual meaning or similarity to another word .
The German dub uses " zwickig " , which also has no meaning , but sounds similar to " zwanzig " ( " twenty " ) .
The Italian dub used " ambarabà " , which is a nonsense word found in a nursery rhyme .
The term pokes fun at the common habit of replacing words during the anti-German sentiment of World War I , such as the replacing of " Sauerkraut " with " Liberty Cabbage " ( according to Grandpa , Liberty Cabbage was , in turn , known as " Super Slaw " ) .
Diddly
( Also spelled diddily ) , Ned Flanders ' characteristic non-word .
Generally speaking , " diddly " , though not in itself a made - up word , is used by Ned Flanders in what linguists call a filled pause , a non-word which a speaker uses to take up time or space in a sentence , and which are sometimes used for emphasis .
Flanders often uses " diddly " as an alliteration in his sentences , i.e .
" What can I diddly - do you for ? " or " Dee - diddly - lighted ! "
Flanders also seems to use filled pauses as a crutch to avoid swearing , as in " son of a diddly ... " , until he finally snaps in " Hurricane Neddy " when the inept townspeople of Springfield , in a disastrous attempt to rebuild his house , push him too far : " Calm down , Neddilly - diddily - diddily - diddily ...
They did their best ...
Shoddilly - iddily - iddily - diddly ...
Gotta be nice ... hostility - ilitybilitydility ... aaaw hell diddly ding dong crap !
Ca n't you morons do anything right ? ! "
Occasionally , Flanders will use " diddly " as a tmesis such as in the episode " Summer of 4 Ft. 2 " in his note at the summer house to the Simpsons ( " Wel - diddly - elcome " , to which Homer responds , " He actually wrote " diddly " ) .
It was also used as a familial word when the ' Flanders Clan ' has a reunion ; José Flanders says when meeting Homer , " Buenos ding - dong - diddly días , señor " ( although Lord Thistlewick Flanders has to be prompted to say it , and does so reluctantly ) .
In the Latin American Spanish dub , " diddly " is often translated as " - irijillo " , an overly elaborate and ridiculous diminutive ( e.g. " Perfectirijillo " ) .
Disease Box
A term for a box a contagious person sat in where other people would come up to in order to try to contract the disease .
In " Milhouse of Sand and Frog " , Maggie caught the chicken pox and Homer put her in a box so that the neighbourhood kids could catch it before they grew up .
He noted that " As with all disease boxes , results may vary . "
Doctorb
Homer , in need of a triple bypass , sees an infomercial showcasing the surgical " talents " of Dr. Nick .
In the ad , Dr. Nick gives the ( presumably ) toll - free number as , " 1-600 - DOCTORB " , going on to explain that " ... The B is for ' bargain ' ! "
It is pronounced / ˈdɔkˌtoːɻb / .
Dodgerock
A game of dodgeball played with a rock instead of a ball .
At least one ( brief ) match was played by Nelson Muntz and Milhouse .
D'oh !
In scripts and episode titles , D'oh is referred to as " annoyed grunt " 1 .
It may be argued that " D'oh " is not a Simpsons neologism , as actor Dan Castellaneta based the phrase on James Finlayson 's similar utterance in many Laurel & Hardy films ; however , Finlayson did not exclaim the term as Castellaneta does , but used it as more of a muttered whine .
Dollareydoo
A term to describe Australian Dollars .
In Bart vs. Australia , when the father of the Australian boy , whom Bart had called collect , saw the bill for 900 dollars , he exclaimed " 900 Dollareydoos ? ! " and asked his son if he had accepted the call from America .
When the Australian boy replies that he'd only accepted the charges because he thought it was urgent , the father confronts Bart over the phone , only to learn his son had fallen victim to a prank .
It is likely that the term " Dollareydoo " is a reference to the aboriginal instrument from Australia , the Didgeridoo or didgeridu .
Do n't have a cow , man !
An exclamation and catchphrase of Bart that implies that the subject should calm down , or not get worked up about something .
It was brought into pop culture mainly by merchandise , as is evidenced by the fact that it is only uttered by Bart on the show a handful of times in the first season ( " There 's No Disgrace Like Home " and " The Call of the Simpsons " ) , and therefore were not self - parodying uses .
In the third season 's " Bart the Murderer " , Eat My Shorts and Don't Have a Cow are horses in a race .
It is n't used again by Bart until the eighth season .
In " The Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show " , in response to Homer 's cartoon debut , Lisa explains , " You ca n't be cool just by spouting off a bunch of worn - out buzzwords . "
Bart replies , " Do n't have a cow , Lis ! " In " The Simpsons Spin- Off Showcase " , Bart sings it along with " eat my shorts ! " as part of his musical introduction in the variety show spin - off .
Occasionally , another character has uttered the line .
In another self - parodying use , Apu , a vegetarian , shows off his t- shirt with the saying surrounding an actual cow in a no symbol in the seventh season 's " Lisa the Vegetarian " .
In the seventh season 's " Summer of 4 Ft. 2 " , After Bart 's complaining that Lisa is acting like him to get friends , Lisa is overheard to say " Do n't have a cow , man ! " ( and later " ¡Ay , caramba ! " ) to which Marge replies , " You have n't said that in four years .
Let Lisa have it . "
In the eighth season 's " Hurricane Neddy " , Ned insultingly mocks " Do n't have a cow , man ! " in front of Bart while he lashes out at at him after Bart stood up for Marge and told Ned to back off .
In the 19th season 's " Apocalypse Cow " , after raising a young bull to adulthood and saving it from the slaughterhouse , Bart comments that he can finally say he " had a cow " .

Flanders is afraid to say the word " sex " even if kids are n't around .
Instead , he calls it " doodily " .
Dorkus Molorkus
Used by Bart , " Dorkus Molorkus " is supposedly a Latin phrase meaning " dork " .
Given as the reason Lisa was unaware of the National Grammar Rodeo .

That 's not Latin ...

Electromicide
According to Dr. Nick Riviera , the only treatment for Bonus Eruptus .

The word " electromicide " is possibly a conflation of the prefix electro- with " homicide " .
Embiggen

The opposite of " belittle " .
From a famous saying by Jebediah Springfield / Hans Sprungfeld : " A Noble Spirit Embiggens the Smallest Man " , evoking the manner in which its antonym , belittle , was coined by Thomas Jefferson .

Glavin
A word used by Professor Frink when he 's muttering .

It is most often heard when Frink is in pain like " Oh , so much pain in the glavin ! " ( pronounced / ˈglejvn̩ / )
This is probably an adaptation of Jerry Lewis 's interjection " froyndleyven ! " , which , in turn , is presumed to be Yiddish semi- nonsense roughly meaning " happytime ! " ( cf. standard German " Freund " , friend ; " Freude " , joy ; " Leben " , life ) .
The similarity to Slavic words for ' head ' ( golova , glava , glowa ) does not account for the vowels or ' n ' and is probably coincidental .
Lewis 's portrayal of the Nutty Professor is considered by many Simpsons fans to be partial inspiration for Frink 's character , and Lewis did a guest voice in one episode as Frink 's father .
Frink :
That meteor is headed straight for us , with the fire , and the impact , and the hundred percent chance of pain !…
Pain in the glavin !!
Alternate spelling : glaven or glayvin .

Homersexual
During a routine disciplinary visit to Principal Skinner 's office , Bart must call Moe 's Tavern looking for his father , Homer .
But when Moe answers the phone , Bart preempts the original purpose of the call and substitutes one of his trademark prank - calls .
Instead of asking for his father " Homer Simpson , " Bart asks for " Homer Sexual . "
With the prank thus launched , Bart quickly hands the phone to the Principal , who is shocked and dismayed to hear Moe Szyslak 's resulting tirade .
Later , when Homer marks Skinner as a possible mate for Selma , an imaginary heads - up display seen from Homer 's point of view ( a spoof of The Terminator movies ) identifies Skinner as a possible " homer- sexual . "
Though not exactly the same , Homer proclaims it is time to " get Homererotic " when he is having himself photographed in suggestive poses for a gift portfolio for Marge .
More recently the term " homersexual " has been used as a parody antonym for the word " metrosexual " ( which means a heterosexual with stereotypical gay habits ) ; in this context , " homersexual " refers to a gay person with stereotypical straight habits .

Professor Hollis : " Looks like you 've come down with a serious case of Jebeditis . "
Lisa : " Just as I was getting over my Chester A. Arthritis . "
Professor Hollis : " Heh heh ... y- you had arthritis ? "
Jebus
According to Matt Groening , The Simpsons writers have an ongoing competition to write a line that " most represents Homer at his singularly most stupid " .
Most likely the current champion is Homer 's faux term for Jesus , first mentioned in the episode " Missionary : Impossible . "
When asked to be a missionary , Homer replies , " I 'm no missionary , I do n't even believe in Jebus ! " .
When the plane that is carrying Homer is taking off , he cries , " Save me Jebus ! "
In popular usage on many discussion boards , such as Fark.com and Guardian Unlimited Talk , it is often deliberately used by posters as an implied " cut " or " chop " against Christians , particularly fundamentalist Christians from the Southern United States .
Sometimes spelled " Jeebus " in this context .
" Jebus " has often been the Papua New Guinean patois for Jesus .

The term " killbot " has gone on to be widely used in Futurama .
Klassic
A deliberately - misspelled version of the word " classic " seen in Krusty Komedy Klassic .
It was misspelled to alliterate with Krusty 's name , but the audience booed and threw things at him because the initials were KKK ( which is also the name of a white supremacist group ) .
Krusty himself noticed the troublesome initials seconds before getting booed and noted to himself , " KKK ?
That 's no good ! " .
Knifey Spooney
A fictional Australian barroom game made in the episode " Bart vs. Australia " , in a parody of a scene from the movie Crocodile Dundee , Bart is confronted by an Australian local who shows him a spoon and says " This is a knife ! "

It , like " Klassic " , was misspelled to alliterate with Krusty 's name , but the audience booed and threw things at him because the initials were KKK ( which is also the name of a white supremacist group ) .
Krusty himself noticed the troublesome initials seconds before getting booed and noted to himself , " KKK ?
That 's no good ! " .
Krisis
A word used by Kent Brockman to assist in alliteratively describing the crisis that occurred at Kamp Krusty when it descended into a state of anarchy after a general revolt by abused campers .
Kwyjibo
Kwyjibo / ˈkwɪdʒiˌbo/ is a word made up by Bart during a game of Scrabble with his family .
In the episode " Bart the Genius , " Bart puts " kwyjibo " on the board , scoring 116 points ( 22 points plus Triple Word Score plus 50 points for using all seven of his letters . )
When Homer demands Bart say what a kwyjibo is , Bart replies , " A big , dumb , balding North American ape … with no chin . "
Marge chimes in , " … and a short temper . "
At this point , realizing it was about him , Homer chases Bart away , causing him to exclaim , " Uh- oh ! Kwyjibo on the loose ! "
' Kwyjibo ' was used as one of the aliases of the creator of the Melissa worm , and is the name of a yo - yo string trick .
' Kweejibo ' is a handmade clothing company in San Francisco .
Recently , Yahoo's online version of Scrabble was advertised on the Yahoo home page with a visual representation of letter tiles spelling out K - W - Y - J - I - B - O. Kwyjibo is also the name of a puzzle involving a Scrabble board in The Simpsons Scene It .
On another James L. Brooks - produced animated series , The Critic , Duke Phillips also made up a fictional word in Scrabble : quyzbuk .
Unlike Bart , Duke was able to immediately legitimize the word by contacting Noah Webster to have the word added to Webster 's Dictionary , defining it to mean " a big problem " .
When he found out no one was using his other word " Dukelicious " , he sadly called the situation a " Duketastrophe . "
This episode , as well as " Bart The Genius , " were written by Jon Vitti , which would explain the similarities .
A similar scene took place in the Dilbert animated series during a Scrabble match between Dilbert and the powerful supercomputer Comp - U - Comp .
Comp - U - Comp 's first move was to lay down all its seven tiles randomly , spelling wipqozn ; it then used its control of worldwide computer systems to immediately bring the word into circulation ( in newscasts , for example ) .
In meaning and usage , " wipqozn " seems roughly equivalent to " crap . "
L
Lamarella
A lame female ( a pun on Cinderella ) .
Bart : Skanks for nothin ' , Lamarella .
Land Cow
How an early Springfield settler describes a buffalo after seeing one for the first time , in the episode " Lisa the Iconoclast " .
In the film Young Jebediah Springfield , which relates the founding of Springfield , the group of migrants see a wild buffalo , with one of them proclaiming , " It 's some sort of land cow ! "
Presumably a reference to sea cows , a term for manatees .
In the video game The Simpsons : Hit and Run , when driving with Cletus Spuckler he will yell " Move it , Land Cow ! " upon hitting something .

A term for large breasts , coined by Krusty .
It was also Stampy 's safety word .

Malonga Gilderchuck
A fictitious Australian word , used in describing how the bullfrogs are all over the place ; presumably it is a generic term for an arbitrary , but common , location .

They 're in the lift , in the lorry , in the bond wizard , and all over the malonga gilderchuck . "
Malparkage
The state or condition of being illegally parked .
In " The City of New York vs. Homer Simpson " Barney had left Homer 's car illegally parked on the plaza at the World Trade Center .
Homer then received a letter regarding this violation :
" Dear motorist , your vehicle is illegally parked in the borough of Manhattan .
If you do not remedy this malparkage within 72 hours , your car will be thrown into the East River at your expense . "
This could be a reference to George Orwell 's Newspeak , featured in his book 1984 , where mal is a prefix for mistake , bad , or wrong .
The following is a bureaucratic jargon quote ( not actually Newspeak , but using Newspeak prefixing ) from 1984 asking the protagonist to fix an error in Big Brother 's speech on Africa :
" times 17.3.84 bb speech malreported Africa rectify "
( Translated into standard English : " There is an error in the reporting of Big Brother 's speech in the Times of 17 March 1984 with regards to Africa ; it needs to be rectified . " )
" Mal - " is also a Latin root word meaning " bad , " and is used in several English words such as " malfunction , " " malignant , " and " maladjusted . "
It could also be a play on the legal term " malpractice " in medical language .

Ned Flanders ' typically cuddly and innocent term for a neglected child .
The line was originally pitched by Matt Groening to be " abuserino " , but was dismissed as sounding too harsh .
Neighborino
A Ned -Flanderized version of the word " neighbor . "
Possibly inspired by comedian Louis Nye on the Steve Allen Comedy Hour ( 1967 ) , whose character Gordon Hathaway greeted Allen by saying " Hi , ho , Steve - a - reeno . "

Mrs. Bellamy 's word for a nervous or scared person from the episode " The Frying Game " .
Also used by Flanders in The Simpsons Movie .
Flanders : Uh , Homer ?
I do n't mean to be a nervous pervis , but if he falls , could n't that make your son a paraplegiarino ?

[ Jimbo breathes on the glass of the freezer at the Kwik - E - Mart , then writes " BITE ME " in the condensation . ]

and as his lifeline , calls Homer for help on which of " electron " , " neutron " , " proton " or " bonbon " , is not an subatomic particle .
Homer begins a diatribe , " Well , it all starts when a nulecule comes out of its nest ... " then Lisa grabs the phone and tells
Moe that the correct answer is " bonbon " .
Moe follows Lisa 's advice and wins $ 500,000 .
Moe then passes on the million dollar question and the Millionaire babes burn the other half of the million dollars in a wheelbarrow .
The true essence of a nulecule and how it gets pregnant ( and who or what gets it pregnant ) and gives birth to atomic particles has not yet been explained .

Osaka Flu
A variation on influenza , that originated in Osaka , Japan , hence the name .
In " Marge in Chains " , a factory worker in Osaka came down with it , but showed up to work anyway .
He then coughed a visible cloud of germs into a box , which was sent to Springfield , along with several other contaminated boxes , starting a town - wide epidemic that infected many citizens including Homer , Bart , Patty , Selma , Principal Skinner , Chief Wiggum , and Todd Flanders .
Its main symptoms are fever and coughing , but it can also cause lethargy , loss of consciousness ( such as with Skinner ) and delirium ( such as with Todd ) .
Several citizens tried to protect themselves from the Osaka flu , such as Mayor Quimby who secretly left town to go to the beach , and Mr. Burns who tried to seal himself in a dome , only for Homer to already be there .
A crowd of infected people demanded a cure from Dr. Hibbert , but he told them that the only cure was bed rest and anything else would be a placebo .
They ransacked his van to search for " placebos " and released a swarm of killer bees , one of which a man ate .

Presbylutheran
Formally The Western Branch of American Reform Presbylutheranism , it is the Protestant church attended by the Simpson family .
Presbylutheranism was formed as a result of a schism with the Presbyterian and Lutheran churches over the right for worshippers to attend church with wet hair ( a tenet the Presbylutheran church has since abandoned ) .
A group of Presbylutheran ministers were also responsible for the approval of the stop- motion animated series Gravey and Jobriath ( a parody of Davey and Goliath , possibly referring to the singer Jobriath ) ; we see one episode in which Gravey builds a pipe bomb to blow up a Planned Parenthood .

One of the cardinal virtues in Presbylutheran ethics , prudissitude is the disposition to be shocked or embarrassed by matters relating to sex or nudity .
Expressions of prudissitude are commonly made out of concern " for the children " .
In the episode , " In Marge We Trust " , Marge raises her concerns about Rvd. Lovejoy 's ministry , telling him that " Sermons about Constancy and Prudissitude are all very well and good , but the church could be doing so much more to reach people . "
Pull a Homer
" To succeed despite idiocy " , or rather , to have great amounts of dumb luck .
After Homer does so in the episode " Homer Defined " , this phrase becomes a temporary fad in the Simpsonverse .
Q
Quantum Tunnel
A tunnel ( that will be invented in the future ) which does not physically exist , but traffic may pass through , by some quirk of physics .
Future Homer drives his hovercar through the Quantum Tunnel on his way to Moe 's Bar .

The name is a reference to the real phenomenon of quantum tunneling .
Quetzalzacatenango
During the episode " El Viaje Misterioso de Nuestro Jomer ( The Mysterious Voyage of Homer ) " , Homer samples many different chilis proudly served by Springfield residents at the annual chili cook - off .
Chief Wiggum prepares an especially spicy concoction for Homer containing , " The merciless insanity peppers of Quetzlzacatenango … grown deep in the jungle primeval by the inmates of a Guatemalan insane asylum . "
" Quetzal " is a Central American bird and the currency of Guatemala .
" Tenango " means " land of " in K'iche .

Literally , the word means , " to become dorky again . "
Re-Neducation

The process involves mechanically forcing clients to smile and performing frontal lobotomies .
Retirony
In the episode " Homer vs. Dignity " , Chief Wiggum explains to a financial planner that retirony means he 'll get shot three days before retirement .
Seemingly a portmanteau of ' retire ' and ' irony ' .
Based on a common cliché in crime and action films , examples of retirony are one of the show 's longest - lasting running gags , as illustrated by these instances :
Reverse Vampire
Vampires that only come out during the day and sleep at night .
First mockingly suggested by Lisa in the episode " Grampa vs. Sexual Inadequacy " as to the reason why parents were going to bed early .

In " Lisa 's Sax " where Homer tells Lisa the story of how she got her sax , he suggests a few other potential instruments : oboe - ma - bo , vio - mo - lin and tuba - ma -ba .
This is an example of Mytacism , or " Too frequent use of the letter m , or of the sound represented by it . "
During Lisa 's absence in " Home Sweet Homediddly - Dum - Doodily " , Homer attempted to " play " Lisa 's baritone saxophone in her memory by singing " Saxamaphone " to the tune of the initial motif from Beethoven 's Fifth Symphony into the instrument .

You see , your crazy friend never heard of " The Food Chain . "
Just ask this scientician .
" Scientician " : [ Looks up from microscope ]
Uh - Troy :

Probably a combination of the words ' science ' or ' scientist ' and the - cian ending of such words as ' dietician ' , ' physician ' , or ' statistician ' .
Scotchtoberfest
Scotchtoberfest is a fake Scottish festival which was featured in the episode " Bart 's Girlfriend " .
It was invented by Principal Seymour Skinner to catch Bart red-handed in the act of perpetrating a prank , as is Bart 's perennial wont .

Bart lifts his kilt with helium balloons , and since Willie wears his kilt without underpants , at least one woman faints at the sight .
Skinner :

Scrod Basket
The fictional town of Little Pwagmattasquarmsettport is called " America 's scrod basket " in " Summer of 4 Ft. 2 " .
Conversely , Springfield is " America 's Crud Bucket " , according to Newsweek .
" Scrod " means " A young cod or haddock , especially one split and boned for cooking as the catch of the day , " so a scrod basket could be a type of fish container , or , in this context , a place producing lots of fish ( Little Pwagmattasquarmsettport appears to be on the coast , so this is feasible ) .
This could also refer to fish and chips , a meal that is often served in coastal towns in a plastic basket with scrod as the fish - hence " scrod basket . "
Lisa :
So where are we going , anyway ?
Marge : Little Pwagmattasquarmsettport .
Apparently it 's America 's Scrod Basket .
Bart : I thought Springfield was America 's Scrod Basket .
Marge : No , Springfield is America 's crud bucket .
At least , according to Newsweek .

To save his lackey , Mr. Burns employs an insult - based motivational technique to inspire Smithers to pedal them both to the hospital .

In one of the segments from " 22 Short Films About Springfield " , a mishap in the kitchen forces Principal Skinner to tell Superintendent Chalmers they were having steamed clams .
After Skinner sneaks back from Krustyburger with lunch , Chalmers confronts him on the change in menu .
Skinner tries to pass off that he in fact said " steamed hams " , a regional term from upstate New York synonymous with hamburgers .
When Chalmers retorts that he is from Utica , and has never heard the term , and that the nickname " steamed hams " made no sense because the burgers were " obviously grilled " , Skinner 's final stab at alleviating his discomfort is " oh , no , it 's an Albany expression " .
To this , an inexplicably satisfied Chalmers replies , " I see , " and ceases the questioning immediately .
This is probably Skinner 's best performance at dealing with Chalmers ; at the end of the night , Chalmers remarks " Well , Seymour , you are an odd fellow , but I must say ... you steam a good ham . "
In the French Canadian dub , Skinner tries to pass a hamburger off as " un ham vapeur , " claiming that it 's a regional dialect from the Lac - Saint - Jean region of Quebec .

First used by Homer in " Duffless " , when he snatches the wad of money he saved , by not drinking for a month , from Marge .

Rumors this week suggest that software giant Microsoft has acquired an Israeli virtual reality company .
Although the acquisition could present any number of uses , insiders are speculating that the move has been made to improve the Redmond - based company 's second - place position in the video game industry .
While much of the technology world buzzes about its upcoming Windows 7 , Microsoft has made an important move in its attempt to halt Nintendo 's steady advance in the gaming industry .
As the Wii continues to run away with the gaming crown by employing motion - sensitive technology and accessible titles , Microsoft has turned to an exciting alternative field : virtual reality .
According to rumors , Microsoft spent as much as $ 35 million to acquire the Israeli start - up company 3DV Systems .
For some time that firm has been working on a rather unique system that employs a three - dimensional camera connecting to a PC .
It 's not drastically different than older technology that allowed players to interact with each other and a game by watching their movements through the camera and on screen .
( Source : reuters.com )
More Advanced Virtual Reality
However , 3DV 's technology is more advanced .
It sends out infrared pulses in order to measure the reflections off objects and judge movement .
3DV had been concentrating most of its energy on hand and even finger movements , although it appears that same technology can be used to interpret head , torso , and arm movement .
Although Microsoft declined to comment on the rumor or its interest in virtual reality systems , Israeli news publication Haaretz has been all over the story .
In a statement , it revealed that " Microsoft is negotiating to acquire ...
3DV Systems for about $ 35 million , despite the alarming condition of the global economy and grim forecasts of more pain to come ...
Microsoft apparently plans to use 3 DV Systems ' technology in its own gaming technology , probably in the Xbox 360 . " ( Source : cnet.com )
If it indeed has acquired such technology , Microsoft may be ready to bridge the divide between its established hardcore Xbox 360 fan base and the seemingly endless mainstream consumer base slowly being enveloped by Nintendo .

We have to bring these regularity agencies into the 21st century . "

It 's Official : No Three Strikes In Germany ( Update )
Some European countries have been moving towards a so - called three strikes model to disconnect repeat P2P infringers from the Internet , but Germany 's not having it .
The German Department of Justice recently met up with leading ISPs for a confidential consultation to discuss the music industry 's new favored strategy against piracy .
There is n't too much know about what went down behind closed doors , but the German IT news service heise .
de is reporting that both sides agreed that Three Strikes is incompatible with German pirvacy and telecommunications laws .
Participating ISPs called the meeting " successful " , according to heise .
de .
The German music industry would probably disagree .
The local IFPI branch recently complained that Germany 's entertainment industry is going to have a competitive diadvantage if countries like Ireland enact Three Strikes , but Germany does n't .
Ireland 's biggest ISP Eircom recently agreed in an out - of - court settlement with major music labels to forward warning notices to alleged infringers .
Users that are caught three times will find heir accounts terminated .
Update : The German blog Spreeblick wanted to know more and asked Germany 's Secretary of Justice Brigitte Zypries for an official statement .
Zypries did actually respond , and her answer leaves few doubts that we wo n't see a Three Strikes - type scenario in Germany anytime soon .
Here 's what Zyrpies had to say :
There are fears the death toll will rise further
More than 30 people have been killed and dozens injured in a bomb attack on a religious procession in Pakistan 's Punjab province , officials say .
The attack targeted Shia worshippers in the town of Dera Ghazi Khan .
They were leaving a mosque when the bomb went off .
It is not clear who carried out the attack or whether it was the work of a suicide bomber .
Sectarian tensions in southern Punjab have in recent years been aggravated by the growing strength of Sunni Taleban .
' Terrorist '
Police are investigating whether the attack was carried out by a suicide bomber .
" It appears to have been a suicide bombing , as there was no crater in the aftermath of the blast , " local police chief Masud - ul - Hasan said .
Meanwhile , local police commissioner Hasan Iqbal told reporters : " It appears to have been a planted device . "
He called it a terrorist attack aimed at Shias to create unrest .
Television footage showed bodies surrounded by debris and ambulances , with survivors wailing and beating their heads in grief .
Some reports speak of protests in the town .
Southern Punjab is home to a number of violent sectarian groups with links to al - Qaeda and the Taleban .
The BBC's Syed Shoaib Hasan in Islamabad says the banned Lashkar - e - Jhangvi , one of Pakistan 's most ruthless militant groups , is blamed for most of the violence .
Lashkar - e- Jhangvi is a militant outshoot of the Sipah - e - Sahaba organisation which demands Pakistan be turned into a hard - line Sunni state .
The Lashkar has been blamed for a string of attacks .

JERUSALEM ( CNN ) -- Palestinian militants fired a long - range rocket from Gaza into southwestern Israel on Tuesday morning .
It was the first such attack into the city of Ashkelon since the two sides declared a cease - fire , the Israeli military said .
This aerial view shows the power station and industrial zone of Ashkelon , Israel , in March of 2008 .
The missile fired from a Grad rocket launcher did not cause any injuries or damage in the coastal city , said a spokesman for the Israel Defense Forces .
Rockets fired from a Grad have a longer range than the crude , home - made Qassams that Palestinian militants in Gaza fire more frequently .
Militants have used Grads to strike farther into Israel .
Ashkelon lies 12 miles ( 19 km ) north of Gaza .
Israel and Hamas , the Islamic militant group that has ruled Gaza since 2007 , declared separate , tentative cease - fires two weeks ago after more than three weeks of fighting in Gaza .
Israel launched the attack on Hamas in Gaza on December 27 with the stated aim of ending rocket attacks on southern Israel .
More than 1,300 Palestinians died and about 5,400 others were wounded .
Thirteen Israelis , including 10 soldiers , were also killed in the fighting .
Since the two sides declared a cease - fire on January 21 , militants have sporadically fired rockets into Israel .
Israel has responded with air strikes .
CNN 's Igor Krotov contributed to this report .

Much Ado About Monads – Maybe Edition Wednesday , January 28 , 2009
In the past I ’ve extensively talked about creating monads , but not as much more around them in terms of why you might use them and what problems they are trying to solve .
Since that time , I ’ve been challenged by others to actually prove not only that it can be understood by everyone , but they are very useful as well .
It ’s been a form of geekery among us software professionals to say , “ Whoopee !
I ’ve learned how to implement a monad to do x ” without really explaining the reason why people should care .
This series of posts is set to dispel some of those qualms people have with the word monad and why it might be useful in other languages besides Haskell , from which the term in the computer science world came .
In the past here , I ’ve talked extensively about them , so I wo n’t necessarily bore you with the excruciating details , but I still have to answer the question in a brief and to the point answer , what exactly is a monad anyways ?
What is a Monad ?
For those not really interested in category theory and such , let ’s get to a basic definition instead .
Think of it as a basic abstract data type used to represent computations .
We can abstract away complex behavior , such as IO actions , asynchronous behavior uniformly in such a way that we can sequence these operations together .
Here ’s the best definition of all , “ We can abstract the complicated things out of the way so that we can write a program that we want to read it instead of how it really works ” .
I ’d rather see the focus not on the category theory part , as that is interesting and a key to what ’s going on here , but instead as a nice design pattern for abstracting complexity .
Now the question arises , how and when do we use them ?
When does it make sense ?
To understand that , we need to look at the problems we ’re facing .
Let ’s take an example of chaining conditionals together which may or may not succeed .
What ’s the Problem ?
To really understand why it ’s useful , we first have to understand the problem we ’re trying to solve .
As I stated above , let ’s first take a look at chaining together conditional operations which may or may not succeed .
Let ’s take for example a series of lookups against some hash tables in a way where one lookup depends on another .
Typically in C# , our code might look like the following .
It ’s naive code in terms of the style but I ’ve seen this pattern time and time again in code :
class Program
{
private static readonly Dictionary < string , string > employeeDept =
new Dictionary < string , string >
{
{ " John " , " Sales " } ,
{ " Bob " , " IT " }
} ;
private static readonly Dictionary < string , string > deptCountry =
new Dictionary < string , string >
{
{ " IT " , " USA " } ,
{ " Sales " , " France " }
} ;
private static readonly Dictionary < string , string > countryCurrency =
new Dictionary < string , string >
{
{ " USA " , " Dollar " } ,
{ " France " , " Euro " }
} ;
public static string GetEmployeeCurrency ( string name )
{
string dept ;
string country ;
string currency ;
if (!employeeDept.TryGetValue( name , out dept ) )
return null ;
if (!deptCountry .
TryGetValue( dept , out country ) )
return null ;
return !countryCurrency .
TryGetValue( country , out currency )
? null : currency ;
}
static void Main ( string [ ] args )
{
var johnCurrency = string .
Format ( " John 's currency : { 0} " ,
GetEmployeeCurrency ( " John " ) ) ;
var peteCurrency = string .
Format ( " Pete 's currency : { 0} " ,
GetEmployeeCurrency ( " Pete " ) ) ;
Console. WriteLine( johnCurrency ) ;
Console. WriteLine( peteCurrency ) ;
}
}
As you ’ll notice from the above code , we have three dictionaries of various information that we ’re using as lookups .
And you ’ll also note that we have to go through a bit of hassle just to determine if one ’s in a list , and if so , continue onto the next .
Similarly , in F# , we run into that same issue as well , with an example of how that could be a problem .
let employeeDept = Map .
of_list ( [ ( " John " , " Sales " ) ; ( " Bob " , " IT " ) ] )
let deptCountry = Map .
of_list ( [ ( " IT " , " USA " ) ; ( " Sales " , " France " ) ] )
let countryCurrency = Map .
of_list ( [ ( " USA " , " Dollar " ) ; ( " France " , " Euro " ) ] )
let employeeCurrency name =
match Map .
tryfind name employeeDept with
| None ->
None
| Some dept ->
match Map .
tryfind dept deptCountry with
| None ->
None
| Some country ->
Map .
tryfind country countryCurrency
let johnCurrency = sprintf " John 's currency : % A " ( employeeCurrency " John " )
let peteCurrency = sprintf " Pete 's currency : % A " ( employeeCurrency " Pete " )
And indeed , you could run into this pattern as well in Haskell without trying really hard either :
import qualified Data .
Map as M
employeeDept :: M.Map String String
employeeDept = M.fromList ( [( " John " , " Sales " ) , ( " Bob " , " IT " ) ] )
deptCountry :: M.Map String String
deptCountry = M.fromList ( [( " IT " , " USA " ) , ( " Sales " , " France " ) ] )
countryCurrency :: M.Map String String
countryCurrency = M.fromList ( [( " USA " , " Dollar " ) , ( " France " , " Euro " ) ] )
employeeCurrency :: String -> Maybe String
employeeCurrency name =
case M .lookup name employeeDept of
Nothing ->
Nothing
Just dept ->
case M .lookup dept deptCountry of
Nothing ->
Nothing
Just country ->
M .lookup country countryCurrency
Just watch that code walk off the screen to the right !
Are you starting to notice a pattern here ?
I sure am !
Now the question arises , what can we do about it ?
How can we write the code the way it should look instead of all the conditional logic we ’ve had to bake in .
Would n’t you rather write it something like this ?
// Pseudocode F#
let employeeCurrency name =
let dept = Map .
tryfind name employeeDept
let country = Map .
tryfind dept deptCountry
Map .
tryfind country countryCurrency
Through the power of monads , we can , at least something very similar to this .
So , let ’s find out how .
Introducing Monads
Monads are a concept in the computer science field to come from the Haskell programming language .
Most people assume , oh , it ’s only used for IO , but that ’s simply not true at all .
Instead , we can treat it as a common abstraction to solve any number of problems , including the conditional logic from above which may succeed or fail .
To create this abstraction , Haskell has a Monad type class which allows us to generalize the application of them .
Let ’s look at exactly what that looks like :
class Monad m where
-- Sequentially compose two actions
-- passing any value produced from the first to the next
(>>= ) :: m a -> ( a -> m b ) -> m b
-- Sequentially compose two actions
-- discarding any value produced from the first
(>>) :: m a -> m b -> m b
-- Inject a value into the monadic type
return :: a -> m a
-- Fail with a message
fail :: String -> m a
I added comments to each function that the type class implements to give you an idea about what each one of them does .
What ’s our ultimate goal here ?
Well , it ’s the ability to string together functions that may or may not succeed and to sequence these instructions together .
With an implementation of a monad , we get that ability .
Now , let ’s move onto the Maybe implementation .
What is maybe anyways ?
It ’s a simple algebraic data type which allows for just a value or no value at all such as this :
data Maybe a = Nothing | Just a
deriving ( Eq , Ord )
Now that we understand that , let ’s move onto looking at the monad instance for the Maybe type .
instance Monad Maybe where
( Just x ) >>= k = k x
Nothing >>= _ = Nothing
( Just _ ) >>
k = k
Nothing >> _ = Nothing
return = Just
fail _ = Nothing
These are defined in the base class libraries in Haskell , so there is no need to implement this yourself .
What this allows us to do is simply our code dramatically .
Let ’s look at the sugared and de-sugared examples :
-- Imperative style
employeeCurrency ' :: String -> Maybe String
employeeCurrency ' name = do
dept <- M.lookup name employeeDept
country <- M.lookup dept deptCountry
M.lookup country countryCurrency
-- De-sugared version on one line
employeeCurrency '' :: String -> Maybe String
employeeCurrency '' name =
lookup employeeDept name >>= lookup deptCountry >>= lookup countryCurrency
where lookup = flip M.lookup
Wow , looks much nicer !
How , you say ?
Because we get to see the code as we ’d like to read it , as a script instead of a bunch of nested if statements .
But , how does this apply to F# and other .NET languages ?
The answer is actually simple and straight forward .
Maybe F# ?
Now that we understand some of the basics and how it can be done in Haskell .
Let ’s translate these ideas to F#. First , we need to consider the Option type , which is a similar implementation to the Haskell Maybe type .
Knowing what we ’ve learned in previous posts on my blog about how monads can be implemented , let ’s look at a standard F# implementation .
[< AutoOpen >]
module MaybeMonad =
let bindM x k =
match x with
| Some x -> k x
| None ->
None
let returnM x = Some x
type MaybeBuilder ( ) =
member x .
Bind ( x , k ) = bindM x k
member x .
Return ( x ) = returnM
member x .
Delay ( f ) = f ( )
When we define a builder such as we ’ve done above , we now have the ability to use the syntactic sugar to wrap our code up in blocks rather nicely .
This is a bare implementation of the monad , as I could add additional features such as support for using bind statements and such .
The Expert F# book walks through this in detail in the Language Oriented Programming section .
We could use either the sugared or de-sugared versions if we do a little bit of work on our part to make this happen .
Let ’s see how we implement this behavior to get what we want :
// Sugared syntax
let maybe = new MaybeBuilder ( )
let employeeCurrency ' name =
maybe { let !
dept = Map .
tryfind name employeeDept
let !
country = Map .
tryfind dept deptCountry
return !
Map .
tryfind country countryCurrency
}
let johnCurrency ' =
sprintf " John 's currency : % A " ( employeeCurrency ' " John " )
let peteCurrency ' =
sprintf " Pete 's currency : % A " ( employeeCurrency ' " Pete " )
// Desugared syntax
let flip f x y = f y x
let ( >>= ) = bindM
let employeeCurrency '' name =
let lookup = flip Map .
tryfind
lookup employeeDept name >>= lookup deptCountry >>= lookup countryCurrency
let johnCurrency '' = sprintf " John 's currency : % A " ( employeeCurrency ' ' " John " )
let peteCurrency '' = sprintf " Pete 's currency : % A " ( employeeCurrency ' ' " Pete " )
This gives us the flexibility we need as programmers to use whichever abstraction we see fit .
Unfortunately , due to type classes not really being something you can easily do in F# , we had to take some liberties with the bind operator and so on .
As an imperative programmer , the sugared syntax makes absolute sense about what I ’m trying to accomplish .
It reads much like a script and to not have to worry about the noise associated with nested if statements littering the codebase .
And yes , you could use the lessons from my Functional C# libraries on MSDN Code Gallery to also implement this in C# , as I ’ve covered in the past .
With the careful use of extension methods and a little know how , you too can write LINQ statements such as this to determine whether an employee ’s currency can be found .
As I ’ve said earlier , you can use the LINQ syntax to do things that do n’t deal with collections at all , such as this :
public static Maybe < string > GetEmployeeCurrency ( string name )
{
return from dept in employeeDept.
TryFind( name )
from country in deptCountry .
TryFind( dept )
from currency in countryCurrency .
TryFind( country )
select currency ;
}
The more you keep working with these abstractions , the more you ’ll understand how to use them and where they apply .
For further reading , I always recommend the Real World Haskell book which goes over these design patterns in detail .
Conclusion
Now , I think through this careful exploration , you may have a better understanding of these design patterns or at least how you might be able to abstract some sort of uniform complexity .
There ’s more to these patterns than just the maybe , as there ’s the ever so familiar list and error , but also some interesting ones that are unique to F# in the async “ workflow ” .
What I ’m really trying to drive home here is that ideas from functional programming are n’t just for guys in lab coats or those at the universities , but for general line of business developers as well .
Stepping out of that comfort zone that is C# or VB and into a more functional language will give you a greater appreciation of different styles and improve your day to day coding .

Maybe someone deserves a bonus .
Like someone who sniffs out the next Bernie Madoff .
Or jousts with tomorrow ’s gonzo bankers .
Or defuses the Next Big Crisis in whatever Next Big Thing is dreamed up by Wall Street .
Someone , in short , who regulates .
It is clear that the nation ’s financial regulators were no match for Wall Street last time .
The financiers were always one step ahead .
But maybe that is n’t surprising .
The financiers , after all , have a big incentive to outsmart the financial police .
It is called a bonus .
Wall Street lures a lot of bright minds with money .
How can federal agencies compete ?
They can’t .
The numbers are sobering .
Mary L. Schapiro , the new head of the Securities and Exchange Commission , will make about $ 162,000 a year .
Timothy F. Geithner , the new Treasury secretary , will pull down about $ 191,300 .
Both of them will make less than many 20 - somethings made on Wall Street during the boom .
And keep in mind that people who work for Ms. Schapiro and Mr. Geithner , and their counterparts at other regulators , make less than their bosses .
3.1 is coming !
We know that many add - on developers have held off on testing for 3.1 compatibility because they ’re waiting for a near - final release to test against .
I ’m happy to report that as of 3.1b2 , no changes are planned which should affect add - on compatibility .
For those of you who migrate to 3.1b2 , chances are extremely high that no further compatibility changes will be required for subsequent beta releases up to and including the final release .
Do n’t hesitate !
With each subsequent beta , more people make the switch and having 3.1 compatibility will ensure a seamless upgrade experience for your users .
In many cases , your add - ons will work on 3.1 without any changes , so if you test and find this to be the case , simply update your add - on compatibility to 3.1b2 and it will automatically be recognized by Firefox during the startup version check .
If you do find that you ’ll need to make code changes , we will prioritize 3.1 compatible extensions in the review queue to make sure that they are approved in a timely manner .
Finally , compatibility will be a requirement for any additions to our Featured and Category Recommended lists - so if you want to be considered for these lists , please make sure your add - ons work on 3.1 .

During the campaign I took to heart President Obama ’s message of looking toward bipartisanship as a means to an end , the ideal end resulting in better governing .
No one was going to simply stand in the middle of the aisle , throw his or her arms out , and bring Democrats and Republicans into a self - congratulatory huddle on day one , or day 1,095 , for that matter .
But it ca n’t be overstated that the current climate in DC has been , for many years , one of entrenchment and gridlock .
That ’s part and parcel of a two - party system , but it does n’t have to be debilitating all the time .
There are cracks in the President ’s veneer of change he championed on the campaign trail .
A friend and colleague of mine was quickly disillusioned with the Administration , and we proceeded to trade off news clips :
She started with the unilateral strike within Pakistan ’s borders ( which Obama had said he ’d do ) , I countered with the lifting of the Gag Rule ; she came back with the hiring of a Pentagon lobbyist to a key post , I responded with the signing of the Lily Ledbetter Act .
For all the talk of Obama ’s “ team of rivals , ” it seems that Sen.
Judd Gregg , President Obama ’s nominee for Commerce Secretary ( to replace embarrassed New Mexico governor Bill Richardson , who in hindsight was the tip of President Obama ’s troubled - nomination iceberg ) , is the only Republican in a major position in the administration one of three Republican appointees ( which pretty much negates this point ) .
The domino display of Obama ’s pending appointees ’ tax problems was and is both grueling and embarrassing .
This really could n’t be a worse time to not pay the government what you owe .
We ’ll probably never know if Obama talked to former Sen .
Tom Daschle and asked him to withdraw his nomination for Secretary of Health and Human Services .
Nevertheless , Obama had to look American in the eye of a camera and say , “ I screwed up . ”
That mea culpa , in and of itself , is a break from the politics of the last eight years .
So was Obama ’s trips to the Hill to negotiate terms on the stimulus package that , despite a good chunk of tax cuts , did n’t garner a single Republican vote in the House .
A more intolerant liberal than I could argue , “ Well , Obama could have put together a package that had no tax cuts and was all domestic spending and we ’d have the same result . ”
That might be true , but , like Daschle stepping down , the Obama Administration needs to practice what it preached .
It has , and the Republicans are quite possibly digging themselves into an even deeper hole than they were before .
No one in his or her right mind believes a perfect bill is going to be passed that saves the economy in a year and we can all go back to our fat , over - consuming lives .
Obama ’s stimulus bill is a hodge - podge of short - and long - term initiatives .
And that ’s because it ’s not just about tax cuts ; it ’s not only focused on spending ; it does n’t ignore health care and environmental initiatives .
Take a look at this mild tantrum of an op - ed from The Wall Street Journal ( which is only getting snottier by the week ) :
The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee , with an apparently recession - proof cash hoard , is running radio ads against 28 House Republicans .
The theme of the ads is " Putting Families First . "
Families first ?
The only family standing at the front of the stimulus pay line is the federal family .
Read the bill .
Check your PC 's virus program , then pull down the nearly 700 pages of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act .
Dive into its dank waters and what is most striking is how much " stimulus " money is being spent on the government 's own infrastructure .
This bill is n't economic stimulus .
It 's self - stimulus .
The op - ed goes on to turn up its nose at the thought of the Fed spending money on itself ( because God forbid our government takes the initiative to bring its buildings and property up to a 21st century , environmentally sound standard , which would save billions of dollars annually ) .
Overall , the various expenses the op - ed deems frivolous add up to a few notches below $ 30 billion .
Thirty billion dollars comes out to a whopping three percent of the now $ 900 - plus - billion dollar package .
Just as Republicans scream to high heaven when they see any mention of condoms , the WSJ is pulling a “ gotcha ! ” on an irrelevant point and patting itself on the back .
This is n’t the President ’s fault .
You ca n’t change people ’s stubborn views , only show them a better way .
But I do n’t think Obama and the Democratic Party should tack hard to the left on this bill or even on future bills because the Republicans are too arrogant , too blind and too ideological for their own good .
I still hold Obama to his word that it ’s time to ease some of the bitterness from our politics .
Republicans bring home the bacon with divisive politics , but that will only keep them spiraling , as the Democratic majority is n’t going anywhere anytime soon .
Senate Republicans were able to stick their $ 15,000 housing credit into the bill .
The credit gives 15 large to anyone who purchases a new home — despite the fact that their previous home is n’t going to rise in value anytime soon , and despite the fact that if either spouse loses their job in this economy that credit becomes irrelevant .
One hopes that credit gets dropped in the final package , but you ca n’t blame the attempts at bipartisanship from the President and his party .
This bill is starting to reflect the shades of gray in our two - party political system — and it also needs to be passed , and passed soon .
The Democratic Party is already running ads in the districts of those House members who voted against the bill , which seems a little soon to my eye but that ’s how politics work .
The Republicans need to figure out just what it is they can expect to get out of this bill , as it will be a bellwether for what they can expect out of this Administration .
There is nearly universal agreement that the opening salvo of the Obama Administrations campaign to restore health to the financial system , delivered this week by new Treasury Secretary Geithner , fell with a loud and ugly thud .
The most common criticism is that the announcement was short on detail .
What is abundantly clear , however , is that the new Administration intends to push spending back up to pre-crash levels and to fill the entire credit void that has disappeared into the black hole of the American financial system .
Whether or not the prior levels of spending and lending were justified by market conditions then , or now , appears to be largely unexamined .
In the worldview of Geithner and like - minded economists , credit , rather than savings , is the central figure in the economic equation .
Therefore , he sees anything that eases the process of lending to be an effective economic policy .
With such a view in mind , the centerpiece of Geithners plan is the commitment of up to $ 1 trillion to revive the collapsed market for securitized debt .
In the lead - up to the Crash of 2008 securitization , more than anything else , permitted Americans to borrow more than they had ever borrowed before .
Developed primarily over the last 10 years , securitization permitted loans of all shapes and sizes to be packaged into investment - ready securities .
The system worked , fueling unprecedented levels of lending in the home , auto , student , and credit card sectors .
But in the last few years as the collateral underpinning these securities has collapsed in value , the trillions of dollars of securitized debt now in circulation has become the toxic sludge at the bottom of our financial pit .
Geithner is making the false assumption that cleaning up and rebuilding the securitization market is a prerequisite for a healthy economy .

( CNN ) -- President Obama joined CNN 's Anderson Cooper on Tuesday to discuss the withdrawal of Tom Daschle as health and human services secretary - designate and the state of the U.S. economy .
Here is a transcript of the interview :
CNN 's Anderson Cooper interviews President Obama at the White House on Tuesday .
Cooper :
Thanks very much for sitting down with us today .
Explain what happened today , Tom Daschle , you 've let one of the most important domestic issues , which is health care , get caught up in what looks to many Americans like politics as usual .
Obama :
Well , I think what happened was that Tom made an assessment that having made a mistake on his taxes that he took responsibility for , and indicated was a mistake , made the assessment that he was going to be too much of a distraction in trying to lead what is going to be a very heavy lift , trying to deliver health care .
And ...
Cooper :
Do you feel you messed up in letting it get this far ?
Watch the full interview »
Obama : Yes .
I think I made a mistake .
And I told Tom that .
I take responsibility for the appointees and ...
Cooper :
What was your mistake , letting it get this far ?
You should have pulled it earlier ?
Obama :
Well , I think my mistake is not in selecting Tom originally , because I think nobody was better equipped to deal both with the substance and policy of health care .
He understands it as well as anybody , but also the politics , which is going to be required to actually get it done .
But I think that , look , ultimately , I campaigned on changing Washington and bottom - up politics .
And I do n't want to send a message to the American people that there are two sets of standards , one for powerful people , and one for ordinary folks who are working every day and paying their taxes .
Cooper :
Do you feel you 've lost some of that moral high ground which you set for yourself on day one with the ...
( CROSSTALK )
Obama :
Well , you know , I think this was a mistake .
I think I screwed up .
And , you know , I take responsibility for it and we 're going to make sure we fix it so it does n't happen again .
Cooper : Let 's talk about the economy , the stimulus .
Every day you get an economic briefing , along with an intelligence briefing .
Which to you is more sobering ?
The economic news you get or the national intelligence ?
Obama :
Well , look , the national security briefing is always sobering because my most important job is obviously keeping the American people safe .
And we have to remain vigilant ; the threats are still out there .
But I will tell you in terms of what is alarming right now is how fast the economy has been deteriorating .
I think even two or three months ago , most economists would not have predicted us being in as bad of a situation as we are in right now .
And ...
Cooper :
It keeps a lot of Americans right now up at night , does it keep you up at night ?
Obama : Absolutely .
It keeps me up at night and it gets me up ...
Cooper : Literally ?
Obama : Literally , because we 've got a range of different problems and there is no silver bullet .
We 're just going to have to work our way through the problem .
So , No. 1 , we 've got to have a recovery package that puts people back to work and ensures that states that are dealing with rising unemployment can deal with unemployment insurance , can provide health care for people who have lost their jobs .
So that 's one set of problems .
Then you 've got a banking system that has undergone close to a meltdown .
And we 've got to figure out how do we intelligently get credit flowing again so that small businesses and large businesses can hire people and keep their doors open and sell their products .
And you know , part of the problem , unfortunately , is that the first round of TARP , I think , drew a lot of scorn .
You know , we learned -- you know , we 've now learned that people are still getting huge bonuses despite the fact that they 're getting taxpayer money , which I think infuriates the public .
So we also have to set in place some rules of the road .
And tomorrow [ Wednesday ]
I 'm going to be talking about executive compensation and changes we 're going to be making there .
Even after we get that done , we still have to get a financial regulatory system in place that assures this crisis never happens again .
And we 've got to do this in the context of a world economy that is declining , because in some ways the Europeans are actually doing at least as badly as we are .
You 've even seen China , which has been growing in leaps and bounds over the last two decades , starting to decline .
So trying to do all of those things on parallel tracks at a time when people are scared and legitimately so , I think is going to be a big challenge .
I think we 're up to the challenge .
But it 's going to take some time and I think the American people recognize that .
Cooper :
On executive compensation , Paul Krugman suggested in The [ New York ]
Times on Sunday that your tough talk may be just for show .
What can you really do ?
Obama :
Well , I think , you know , we 'll talk about it tomorrow , but we 're going to be laying down some very clear conditions in terms of where ...
Cooper : Do you support [ Missouri Democratic Sen . ]
Claire McCaskill 's idea of capping ...
Obama :
Well , I -- again , I do n't want to completely pre-empt my announcement tomorrow .
Cooper : You could here .
( LAUGHTER )
Obama :
But I think there are ways -- there are mechanisms in place to make sure that institutions that are taking taxpayer money are not using that money for excessive executive compensation .
And I think that when you see the announcement that we make , people will say , this is a reasonable approach .
It 's not a government takeover .
Private enterprise will still be taking place .
But people will be accountable and responsible .
And that 's what we have to restore in the financial system generally .
Cooper :
On the stimulus plan for you , what is non-negotiable with Republicans ?
Obama :
The unemployment insurance , health care for people who have lost their jobs , you know , providing some relief to the states on those fronts , and providing families relief , that 's very important .
Infrastructure investments that lay the groundwork for long - term economic growth , I think , is critical .
You know , so , for example , when we say we 're going to weatherize 2 million homes , that 's not just make - work .
First of all , you can employ people weatherizing those homes .
We are also then saving families -- individual families on their energy bills , but the third thing is , it 's making this country less dependent on foreign oil .
So the same is true for health IT , the same is true when it comes to education .
We want to train thousands of teachers in math and science , and invest in science and technology research .
All of those things will make us more competitive over the long - term .
What I do think is negotiable is some programs that I think are good , good policy , but may not really stimulate the economy right now .
Cooper : How did they even get into the bill in the first place ?
I mean , why did they get this far ?
Obama :
Well , I understood -- you know , there are 535 members of Congress who have their own opinions .
Cooper :
Do you think some of the House Democrats went too far ?
Obama :
You know , I think that if you look at -- first of all , I think , in fairness to the House Democrats , and this has n't been talked about enough , if you tally up all of the programs that have been criticized on " AC 360 " or anywhere else , that amounts to less than 1 percent of the total package .
So they actually were remarkably disciplined considering the size of this package .
We 've -- they left out , at my request , all earmarks , so there are n't private pet projects .
And by the way , many of the critics of the current package can't say that about any of the budgets they passed over the previous six or eight years .
Cooper :
But this is what American people are hearing about , whether rightly or wrongly .
And I mean , did the Republicans beat you on selling this ?
On selling the message ?
Did you lose the message ?
Obama :
Well , no , no .
I do n't think we 've lost the message .
That 's why I 'm here with you .
Everybody is going to be watching me talk to you today .
But I think that the American people understand something has to be done .
They want to make sure that we 're serious about it , and that we 're not using this to promote politics as usual .
And that 's what I 'm insisting on .
You asked earlier , do I lose sleep ?
Look , the only measure of my success as president when people look back five years from now or nine years from now is going to be , did I get this economy fixed ?
I have no interest in promoting a package that does n't work .
Because I 'm not going to be judged on whether or not I got a pet project here or there , I 'm going to be judged on , have we pulled ourselves out of recession ?
I think the members of Congress understand that as well .
I do n't question the sincerity of some Republican critics who may think that they can do better on this .
And I 'm happy to negotiate with them if they 've got better ideas .
I 'm happy to do it .
What I wo n't do is in some cases , some of the criticism has suggested that the better approach would be to do exactly what we did over the last eight years that got us into this problem in the first place .
There is going to be some differences ideologically or in terms , you know , recipes for how to fix the economy .
And , you know , those differences we can live with .
But I think -- I still think we can arrive at a package that works for the American people .
Cooper :
So , five years or nine years , which one are you hoping for right now ?
( LAUGHTER )
Cooper : Based on what you 've seen so far ?
Obama :
You know , listen , you want to be president when times are tough , because , you know , I did n't do all of this just to occupy this fancy office .
I did -- I came here to change things .
Cooper : I 've noticed you do n't use the term " war on terror , " I think I read an article that you 've only used it once since the inauguration .
Is that conscious ?
Is there something about that term you find objectionable or not useful ?
Obama :
Well , you know , I think it is very important for us to recognize that we have a battle or a war against some terrorist organizations .
But that those organizations are n't representative of a broader Arab community , Muslim community .
I think we have to -- you know , words matter in this situation because one of the ways we 're going to win this struggle is through the battle of hearts and minds .
Cooper :
So that 's not a term you 're going to be using much in the future ?
Obama :
You know , what I want to do is make sure that I 'm constantly talking about al Qaeda and other affiliated organizations because we , I believe , can win over moderate Muslims to recognize that that kind of destruction and nihilism ultimately leads to a dead end , and that we should be working together to make sure that everybody has got a better life .
Cooper : Final questions , just a quick lightning round , just a couple of fun questions .
What 's the latest on the dog search ?
Obama :
We are going to get it in the spring .
I think the theory was that the girls might be less inclined to do the walking when it was cold outside .
Cooper : Portuguese water dog ?
You do n't know yet ?
Obama :
You know , we 're still experimenting .
Cooper : Coolest thing about your new car ?
Obama :
You know , I thought it was the phones until I realized that I did n't know which button to press .
That was a little embarrassing .
Cooper :
Have you had a cigarette since you 've been to the White House ?
Obama :
No , I have n't had one on these grounds .
And I -- you know , sometimes it 's hard , but , you know , I 'm sticking to it .
Cooper :
You said , on these grounds , I 'll let you pass on that .
And final question , you 've read a lot about Abraham Lincoln .
What is the greatest thing that you 've learned from your studies of Lincoln that you 're bringing to the office right now ?
Obama :
You know , when I think about Abraham Lincoln , what I 'm struck by is the fact that he constantly learned on the job .
He got better .
You know , he was n't defensive .
He was n't arrogant about his tasks .
He was very systematic in saying I 'm going to master the job and I understand it 's going to take some time .
But in his case , obviously , the Civil War was the central issue , and he spent a lot of time learning about military matters , even though that was n't his area of experience .
Right now I 'm learning an awful lot about the economy .
I 'm not a trained economist , but I 'm spending a lot of time thinking about that so that I can make the very best decisions possible for the American people .
Cooper : Mr. President , thank you very much .
Obama :
Thank you .
Appreciate it .
All About Barack Obama • Thomas Daschle
IT IS the invisible presence that governs your world .
Trailing you like an unshakeable shadow , it ticks and tocks incessantly – you can sense it in your heartbeat , in the rising and setting of the sun , and in your daily rush to make meetings , trains and deadlines .
It brings order to our lives through the categories of past , present and future .
Time .
There is nothing with which we are so familiar , and yet when you try to pin it down you find only a relentless torrent of questions .
Why does time appear to flow ?
What makes it different from space ?
What exactly is it ?
It ’s enough to make your neurons misfire , then sizzle and smoke .
You are not alone .
Physicists have long struggled to understand what time really is .
In fact , they are not even sure it exists at all .
In their quest for deeper theories of the universe , some researchers increasingly suspect that time is not a fundamental feature of nature , but rather an artefact of our perception .
One group has recently found a way to do quantum physics without invoking time , which could help pave a path to a time - free “ theory of everything ” .
If correct , the approach suggests that time really is an illusion , and that we may need to rethink how the universe at large works .
For decades , physicists have been searching for a quantum theory of gravity to reconcile Einstein ’s general relativity , which describes gravity at the largest scales , with quantum mechanics , which describes the behaviour of particles at the tiniest scales .
One reason it has been so difficult to merge the two is that they are …
Studies show that many Americans incorrectly believe the Palestinians are the illegal settlers on their own land .
I long regarded Frank Rich a champion , whose fearless exposures of moral hypocrisy in our culture and the media rang true .
My view changed after this New York Times columnist gave a talk at Cornell University .
Mr. Rich was asked about our media ’s reporting in the Middle East and their unwavering presentation of Israel - as - victim .
How is it that Americans are so poorly informed that a large fraction believes that the Palestinians are the illegal settlers in the Occupied Territories ?
Mr. Rich was asked why he , as a media critic , had remained silent on this biased coverage ?
Mr. Rich replied , “ I ’m Jewish . ”
His candor is refreshing but what does he mean ?
Is Mr. Rich suggesting that being Jewish precludes criticizing Israel ?
Is he suggesting that Jewish American reporters , ( and more insidiously , publishers ) feel compelled to defend Israel ?
Where is professional responsibility to the American public ?
My criticism extends beyond the failings of a single reporter .
As studies have shown , many Americans believe that the Palestinians are the illegal settlers on their own land .
How can we be so poorly informed ?
And why has n’t the news media worked to correct this misconception ?
The answer , some say , is that a conspiracy exists among mainstream media to sift and shape news to favor the Israeli government .
Media ’s fear , according to this belief , is that a truly informed American people would realize that the Israeli agenda and policies clash with US values and strategic interests .
I do n’t believe this conspiracy theory .
The pro-Israel bias , in my view , is particular to each newspaper , each TV network .
Bias manifests itself in a Frank Rich silence , in a reporter ’s sensitivity to his editor ’s predilections , in a political cartoon first accepted by staff then rejected by an owner / publisher .
Taken together , the public is deprived of fact and opinion .
“ This is the greatest story never told , ” as Steve Lendman convincingly demonstrates in his expose of willful bias in the NY Times .
The BBC has taken seriously documented reports of a pro-Israel bias in its coverage of the Israeli - Palestinian conflict .
The BBC governors commissioned an independent study which concluded that an Israeli viewpoint did , indeed , dominate at the expense of Palestinian concerns .
The commission proposed specific remedies to correct future reporting in the Mideast .
This effort would never happen in the United States .
The honored role of the media in our democracy is to promote informed , public discussion on issues important to our country .
“ Informed ” is the key word here .
Full , objective information must be available to citizens to engage in meaningful debate .
Mainstream media , by providing only one - sided reporting , suppresses open discussion of Israeli policies and their effect on our national interests .
We Americans are living with the consequences .
The owner of a Sydney cafe targeted by a graffiti offender says the three - month jail sentence handed to the teenager is too harsh .
Magistrate Ian McRae handed the sentence to first - time offender Cheyane Back yesterday for vandalising the wall of the Hyde Park cafe with a black marker last month .
The 18 - year - old had pleaded guilty to damaging or destroying property .
She has been granted unconditional bail and has already lodged an appeal against the sentence , to be heard next month .
New South Wales Premier Nathan Rees has welcomed the three - month jail term because he says everywhere he goes , graffiti is an issue .
" This sends a message that it 's not something that the community regards as a frivolous offence .
" It is something that affects not only the aesthetic but people 's sense of safety around the place if they see graffiti around and they think there is other anti-social behaviour going with it .
" I think a three - month jail term is absolutely appropriate . "
But cafe owner Song Wang believes community service is a more suitable punishment than jail .
" Give them more education , provide more education , and let them do some community service , " she said .
University of New South Wales criminologist Professor Chris Cunneen agrees that the jail sentence does not match the scale of the crime .
" In the adult courts , a normal sort of penalty in relation to that offence would be a fine of some sort and some form of restitution for the property owner , " he said .
" But I think there are other ways of approaching it .
I 'm not suggesting that a fine is the best way to do it .
" We 've got some great examples from the Children 's Court in terms of youth justice conferencing , which has been used in relation to graffiti , where you bring the offender together with the victim of the crime .
" You reach some sort of resolution and the offender is held responsible for the offence that 's been committed and I think that 's a much more preferable way of dealing with this . "
Anti-vandalism community group Graffiti Hurts has applauded the sentence , saying graffiti costs Australian taxpayers $ 500 million a year .
" I do n't think Washington wins , " President Obama tells NBC 's Brian Williams in the interview that the TV network will broadcast this evening -- one of five sit - downs the president did with national news anchors this afternoon .
" The fact of the matter is Tom Daschle pulled out today , " Obama continues .
" And I 'm here on television saying I screwed up and that 's part of the era of responsibility ; is not never making mistakes ; it 's owning up to them and trying to make sure you never repeat them and that 's what we intend to do . "

The networks are sending out excerpts .
Highlights from the others we 've gotten so far :
• Obama tells ABC 's Charles Gibson this was an embarrassing day for his administration , with the collapse of Daschle 's nomination as Health and Human Services secretary and Nancy Killefer as chief performance officer .
" We 're going to have some glitches , " Obama adds , " and I understand that that 's what people are going to focus on .
And I 'm focused on it because I do n't want glitches .
We can't afford glitches because , right now , what I should be spending time talking to you about is how we 're going to put three to four million people back to work .
And so this is a self - induced injury that I 'm angry about , and we 're going to make sure we get it fixed . "
( Update at 7:45 a.m. ET , Feb .

• The president tells CNN's Anderson Cooper that " I think my mistake is not in selecting Tom originally , because I think nobody was better equipped to deal both with the substance and policy of health care .
He understands it as well as anybody , but also the politics , which is going to be required to actually get it done .
But I think that , look , ultimately , I campaigned on changing Washington and bottom - up politics .
And I do n't want to send a message to the American people that there are two sets of standards , one for powerful people , and one for ordinary folks who are working every day and paying their taxes . "
( Update at 7:45 a.m. ET , Feb .
4 : Video of CNN 's interview has been posted online here . )
• He says to CBS ' Katie Couric that Daschle 's withdrawal is " frustrating for me and it's something that I take responsibility for .
Tom , I think , is an outstanding individual .
I am absolutely convinced that he would ’ve been the best person to help shepherd through , uh , what 's going to be a very difficult process to get healthcare for American families . "
( Update at 7:45 a.m. ET , Feb.
4 : Video of CBS ' interview has been posted online here . )
• The two nominees stepped down , however , because " we can't send a message to the American people that we have two sets of rules -- one for prominent people and one for ordinary people , " he tells Fox News Channel 's Chris Wallace .
" Ultimately I have to take responsibility for a process that resulted in us not having an HHS Secretary at a time when people need relief on their healthcare costs < " Obama also says to Wallace .
" This is a mistake , probably not the first one I am going to be making in this office , but what I 'm absolutely committed to doing is fixing it , getting a highly qualified HHS Secretary , and then making sure we start delivering some healthcare relief to families who so desperately need it . "
( Update at 7:45 a.m. ET , Feb .

Obama also tells ABC's Gibson that :
" You know , I feel surprisingly comfortable in the job .
I think I 've got a great staff .
We 've got a great team .
" The challenges are big .
You know , we 've got an economy that I think is worse than anybody would have anticipated even two or three months ago .
We 've seen some progress in Iraq , but in Afghanistan we 've got enormous challenges .
And we 've got a -- not just an immediate economic crisis , but a long - term budget issue in terms of the amount of debt that we 're accumulating .
" Trying to square all those circles is a challenge .
But one thing that I 'm absolutely convinced about is that you want to be president when you 've got big problems .
If things are going to smoothly , then this is just another nice home office . "
All five networks will be broadcasting their interviews this evening .
One of the least understood aspects of the financial crisis — but potentially the most damaging — is the market for over - the - counter derivatives and particularly one type of derivative known as a credit default swap ( CDS ) .
The losses at American International Group ( which was the recipient of a vast public bailout last year financed by the Fed of New York for the benefit of Goldman Sachs and the other large CDS dealers banks ) stem in large part from CDS contracts .
And there are many other AIG - type situations festering in the United States and Europe that will burst into bloom in coming months .
AIG ’s sin was thinking it could buy low - risk growth through CDS , but even veteran CEO Hank Greenberg failed to understand the true risk of insuring credit losses .
And the sad part is that in chasing growth by taking risks with CDS , Greenberg and AIG were entering a relatively low - margin business compared with traditional insurance .
What is the problem with CDS ?
The tension , especially regarding the large money center banks and other financial houses , comes from several basic flaws in the model for these instruments .
These are deliberate flaws built into the game that include the lack of a central counterparty , no effective limit on dealer leverage and a schizophrenic pricing methodology that has nothing to do with the several different types of underlying risk contained in these contracts .
It is a market designed by and for the seller , to the disadvantage of the buyer .
But CDS may also be thought of as a poker game where the dealers have few chips on the table .
It is very telling that more than a year into the crisis and six months since the AIG rescue , the Federal Reserve Board still refuses to enforce any type of credit margin discipline over dealers in the CDS markets , which would raise collateral requirements on dealer positions to realistic levels .
Thus the short - selling pressure on Citigroup and other wounded money centers is magnified many times above the true pool of investors with hedging needs , including the much maligned ranks of the hedge funds .
You see , it is the banks too , not just the hedge funds , which sell short the securities of the other banks , a kind of speculator cannibalism .
What the Fed will not tell you is that it is the largest dealers — and not the customers like hedge funds — that are the systemic problem when it comes to CDS and inadequate collateral regulations .
Let me say that again : the systemic risk to the global markets comes not primarily from the rapacious hedge funds , who mostly are forced to post real collateral behind their trades , but from the other dealers and financial institutions in the United States and the European Union particularly .
These banks are writing CDS positions to support short sales against other bank names or buying CDS to hedge regulatory capital needs or both .
For those of you with normal lives not cluttered with acronyms related to obscure financial instruments , a CDS contract is essentially a form of insurance on a corporate bankruptcy or default .
Less generously you could call it a gaming contract .
The contract says that the writer of the insurance is obligated to purchase a bond issued by Ford or Citigroup from the buyer in the event those entities default .
Thus when Lehman Brothers filed bankruptcy , the writers of protection via those CDS contracts had to pay the buyer of protection 97 % of the face value of the Lehman Brothers bonds , because there is expected to be little recovery for bond holders in the Lehman bankruptcy .
In the case of the government takeover of Fannie and Freddie Mac , the CDS protection payments were very low because there is little or no expected loss for bondholders — at least at the moment .
Many observers have been critical of hedge funds that do or at least did write naked CDS positions during the past several years , essentially like being short a put option , without adequate capital .
Hedge funds generally do n't have capital other than insider funds , thus the concern .
This issue of adequate capacity and the ability of writers of CDS protection to pay last year almost led the New York State Insurance Department to unilaterally begin the regulation of CDS counterparties who were writing risk for regulated insurance companies .
It now seems that the large bank dealers and a number of banks in Europe are themselves the weakest link in the chain in terms of systemic risk .
This reportedly is why then - Fed of New York chief Tim Geithner insisted on bailing out AIG — to prevent an AIG bankruptcy from dragging Goldman Sachs and other dealers down as well .
As the New York Times reported last year , Goldman was AIG 's largest trading partner and CEO Herb Blankfein was in the room when the AIG bailout was hammered out by Geithner .
By failing to enforce margin limits on CDS leverage while investing new capital in Citigroup , Bank of America and other large banks via the TARP , the U.S. Fed and Treasury , as well as global regulators in the EU and Asia — are essentially trying to fill up a bucket with a hole in the bottom .
The Fed and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ( OCC ) are entirely complicit in this contradictory effort to protect the ability of the major CDS dealer banks in London , Paris and New York to continue to do business without any basic prudential limitations .
If the U.S. Congress truly understood the duplicity of the Fed and OCC when it comes to concealing the risk from over - the - counter derivatives , these agencies would be closed down tomorrow .
Consider that nothing was wrong with the basic model for unregulated derivatives markets such as CDS — then there would be no need for the global financial industry to have " torn up " $ 30 trillion or half of the notional amount of contracts during the past year !
The truth , by the way , is that these contracts were not always actually extinguished .
Sometimes they are merely paired up with opposite contracts to " net out " the risk using the facility of the DTCC .
Only time will tell if this approach to deflating the CDS bubble , which is many times the underlying cash basis , will succeed .
But even if you believe that most of the remaining $ 30 trillion in notional amount of CDS faithfully reported by the DTCC in New York is not problematic , this is happening as corporate default rates rise to historic levels .
That still leaves trillions of dollars in net CDS exposure concentrated among some of the less savvy players in the global banking and investment worlds , including some of the largest banks in Europe .
For example , UBS just announced thousands of layoffs at its investment bank as part of dramatic cost - cutting related to credit - related losses .
Some even anticipate UBS closing its investment bank entirely .
The Fed and the OCC are entirely complicit in this contradictory effort to protect the ability of the major CDS dealer banks in London , Paris and New York to continue to do business without any basic prudential limitations , a pandering bias toward the largest banks that illustrates regulatory capture well .
When the political classes of the industrial nations reckon the final cost of managing down the CDS bubble , the only sane alternative will be to slowly allow some of the largest banks to be restructured , or merely wither as assets are sold .
The more savvy observers in the media are already asking what New York will look like without the large money center banks as anchor tenants .
But the more pertinent question will be how many more Lehman Brother - style liquidations we will see in 2009 .
Then the question will be asked , particularly in Europe and Washington :
Is the wild growth of speculative markets such as CDS a sign of fundamental economic decay ?
When a speculative market grows to many times the real , cash basis and is therefore not validated by the real economy , is it any surprise that the largest banks in the world are insolvent ?
While many of the global financial systems problems are traced back to housing or other base markets , the unlimited leverage of CDS may be reckoned as the catalyst for the global meltdown among the largest banks .
Greenberg and AIG went into CDS chasing higher growth , but also bought big risks .
The bottom line : what remains of the CDS market will be cleared and settled by one or more central counterparties by mid-year .
The market will be increasingly transparent .
Meaningful margin discipline , collateral and risk limits will be imposed .
This will have a devastating effect on the big banks ' fixed income revenues , but will actually improve their balance sheets greatly and lower the overall risk in the US financial system .
Two decades later , the ruins of Soviet tanks can still be found in Kabul
Twenty years ago this week , Soviet troops pulled out of Afghanistan , after nine years of occupation .
Lyse Doucet was our correspondent in Kabul then and she 's back in the Afghan capital now .
I still keep the single sheet of paper - dull grey , stark black font , with the seal of the British embassy in Kabul , dated 19 January 1989 .
" I must advise you , " it warns , " you should leave Afghanistan without delay while normal flights are still available " .
The British ambassador then pulled down the Union flag and locked the gates of a magnificent compound Lord Curzon once said was worth five divisions .
The US ambassador had done the same weeks earlier , urging Soviet troops to complete their pullout and predicting the collapse of the Afghan government .
Anxious voices
These were the dying days of the Soviet empire in the harsh winter of 1989 .
We did n't know it then .
But we felt Kabul was in the eye of the storm .
Every day , several times a day , I was asked , in whispered anxious voices , by foreigners and Afghans : " Are you leaving ?
Do you think it 's safe to stay ?
When will Najib go ? "
Najib is what many called the Soviet - backed president , Najibullah .
Najibullah - 'he was very strong '
Some said he was a murderer , from his days heading the infamous KGB - trained Khad secret service .
His nickname was the Ox - he was a burly man with a big voice and a barrel chest .
He declared , to anyone who would listen , he was n't going anywhere .
Not many believed him then .
In neighbouring Pakistan , mujahideen rebels , backed by the might of the United States , the money of Saudi Arabia , and the efforts of Pakistan , bickered over the formation of an alternative government .
Earlier , while in Islamabad , I was warned by some mujahideen leaders to be careful in Kabul .
They later sent safe - passage letters so that when they entered I would not be harmed .
For them , it was only a matter of weeks .
How hard it was then to know if they were right or Najibullah was .
City cut off Even Soviet officials heightened this sense of siege , speaking of 30,000 mujahideen fighters just beyond the snow - capped mountains that encircle this city .
The rockets fell on Kabul every day .
But was Kabul itself even close to falling ?
Afghans still worry about the future , foreigners still ask if it's safe to stay
In recent weeks , I 've been calling Afghans who were the president 's closest advisers then .
" Was Najib really that strong then ? " I asked one former aide .
" Najib was n't just strong , " he insisted , " he was very strong " .
Kabul in 1988 was isolated - by Cold War rivalries , and often cut off by snow that blocked any road or flight out of the city .
There were of course no mobile telephones or internet then , just a small number of clattering telex machines and only three international telephone lines .
For some reason , many calls were routed through Glasgow .
So every day , in my fourth floor room in a gloomy hilltop hotel , I spent a lot of time talking to Scottish telephone operators .
Three years later President Najibullah 's rule finally ended .
He was brought down by intrigues within his own party and in Moscow , an ill - fated UN process , and double - dealing by rival mujahideen commanders .
They eventually took over Kabul and destroyed large parts of it .
Body hung
The president still did not manage to leave as his regime collapsed around him .
He took refuge in a UN compound .
And when the Taleban stormed into Kabul in 1996 , he was urged to flee , but with his trademark confidence , he insisted : " I know my people , I will stay . "
Life is still hard for children in Kabul Vengeful Taleban fighters killed him and hung his body at a roundabout alongside his brother .
That was then , and this is now .
On Kabul 's freezing winter streets Afghan urchins press smudged faces against car windows peddling photographs of Afghan leaders including Najibullah .
Copies of his speeches now do a brisk trade in the market - they are admired by some Afghans for their wisdom and wit .
The violence has not gone either .
Now it is Taleban suicide bombs rather than mujahideen rockets which terrorise this city .
Afghans still worry about the future , foreigners still ask if it is safe to stay .
And , just as many once asked how long President Najibullah could cling on to power , now they ask whether an embattled President Karzai will be elected again - and Western governments , including a new administration in Washington , raise questions about his rule .
Twenty years on Kabul remains threatened by rebels , cradled by the Hindu Kush , still very much in the eye of the storm .

Oh you ’ve been on a fast train
And its going off the rails .
And you ca n’t come back , ca n’t come back again .
And you start breaking down , in the pouring rain
Oh , you ’ve been on a fast train .
…. Got to go on the land .
Stuck in no -man ’s land .
Ai n’t nobody on your way back .
Ai n’t nobody going to lend you a helping hand .
And you start breaking down
And you falling to the sound
You are hearing a fast train .
- Van Morrison , sung by the incomparable Solomon Burke
Despite the fact that there are plenty of people out there who view me as wildly apocalyptic , I do n’t actually consider myself a doomer .
My own feeling is that while radical restructuring awaits us , our future probably wo n’t look much like _ The Road_ .
I have argued that what we face due to peak energy , climate change and our financial crisis can best be described as “ ordinary human poverty ” - and we can do much to mediate our experience , that we can experience either an ordinary , survivable poverty or one that becomes pathological , based on our own choices .
On the other hand , compared to the mainstream culture , which tells us endlessly that things will stay the same or get better always , I am , of course , your friendly neighborhood Apocalyptic Dominatrix of Doom .
That ’s me , cracking the whip over my readers to get their gardens going , food storage in order , learn to darn socks and fix their own roofs , etc … Carolyn Baker was kind enough to mention me as a notable Dystopian chick in her well deserved rebuke to the New Yorker .
So even though I often spend time observing “ well , I do n’t really think that we ’re literally going to see TEOTWAWKI ” I suppose I qualify as one of Cassandra ’s descendents .
A while back , I wrote my doomiest post to date , when I sat down to compose a section of _A Nation of Farmers_ that described the changes in food and energy issues as of last April .
I was so shocked at what the aggregate shift in our reality looked like put down on paper that I posted it as “ We regret to inform you …” and I argued that we are , in fact , in the midst of a fast crash of our society .
I wrote then ,
“ When climate change and peak oil thinkers run out of other things to worry about , there ’s always the endless , inevitable debates about whether we are facing a “ fast crash ” or a “ slow grind . ”
And I admit , I ’m worried about my fellow environmentalists – because I think they are about to lose their favorite distraction .
When no one was looking , we got an answer .
Fast crash wins .
And we ’re in it now .
Wait a minute , you argue – that ’s not right .
If we were in a fast crash we ’d be well on our way to living in a Kunstler novel .
But we ’ve still got cars , we ’ve got food , things are slowing down , but at worst this looks like a slow grind – but the crazy lady at the blog is saying fast crash ?!?!?
Before you argue with me ( and you are both welcome and encouraged to ) , I ’d like to post something a bit out of my usual style – it is simply a description of what has happened with food and energy in the last year – that ’s all it is .
Then tell me what you think – because it was n’t until I began to write this introduction to the present food situation that I suddenly was struck by the fact that even a fast crash does n’t always look fast when you live it – new normals arise and it turns out we assimilate faster than we panic .
So here we are – the “ We regret to inform you that what you have imagined to be “ civilization ” is now falling apart ” post .
See if it strikes you the way it struck me . ”
Although the major issues have changed somewhat - the collapse in energy prices has meant that now people can’t pay for heat because they do n’t have a job , rather than because of the high price of energy , and the economic crisis has mostly numbed us to the growth of hunger in the poor world - I do n’t see anything to suggest that we are not still in a rapidly accellerating crisis .
The only thing is that even at my most apocalyptic , I would never have guessed how fast – and I think that that ’s probably true of most “ doomers . ”
But I ’m starting to feel like I ought to give back the quirt , the cat o’nine tails and that funky leather corset personally bestowed upon me by Richard Heinberg and Pat Murphy when I was inducted into the Ancient Order of Apocalyptic Prophets ( you should have seen what they were wearing – I ’m sworn to secrecy , but it was very fetching ! )
You see , I ’m starting to feel I ca n’t compete with reality – any actual attention to events as they unfold points up the fact that my own doomiest imaginings are being wildly exceeded .
Let ’s see – California is broke , functionally insolvent , and has stopped paying for just about everything , including its state police .
Remember how often they trumpted that they were the 6th largest economy in the world – well , that ’s kinda like saying the UK is insolvent…oh , and that actually might be not so far from the truth too , since they just had to nationalize their banking system .
We ’ve lost at least 300,000 jobs in two weeks .
The New York Times may be out of business by spring .
While neither rain nor sleet nor hail will keep the postal service from its appointed rounds , money probably will , and they are talking about cutting out Saturday deliveries .
Homelessness and hunger are rapidly on the rise , as are suicide and murder suicide .
There ’s rioting in Russia , China , Greece , and massive worker demonstrations in France and Britain .
Australia is seeing record high temperatures , while many of the rest of us struggle with record lows .
California ’s drought may be the worst in a century .
And the already hungry are among the deepest sufferers of the food crisis .
The New York Times , Fortune Magazine , Bloomberg – they are all starting to use words like “ Biblical proportions ” “ Deep Depression ” “ Apocalypse . ”
It is getting hard to compete with the mainstream doomers .
We ’ve been “ fixing ” the problem – which is a big part of the problem – think of the word “ fix ” here as in “ the fix is in . ”
We ’ve just spent 8 trillion dollars bailing out the banks – more than all the wars in US history , the Louisiana purchase and the space program combined .
And what did we get for it ?
Bank of America and Citi are still teetering , the jobs are still being flushed daily .
The estimate is half a million a month – every month .
And people are n’t really very angry yet .
They should be – think about what 8 trilliion dollars could actually have bought us , had anyone cared as much about the people as they do about the banks , and about the wealth of the fortunate .
At some point people will realize that it is n’t going to work – and their anger will be frightening – and just .
The New Hampshire state legislature is currently debating legislation that would assert that if the US implements martial law or abrogates the Constitution , it will effectively dissolve the Union .
While one wonders where they were the last eight years , this is being taken quite seriously , and it would have been unthinkable a decade ago .
Eight trillion could have paid for free health care for every American , cradle to grave for a century .
Eight trillion was sufficient to cover the cost of almost all the mortgage debt - every American could have been given their house and the “ foreclosure crisis ” ended instantly .
Eight trillion was enough to build renewable energy infrastructure that could have softened the crisis , to reinsulate our houses , to provide basic food and health care to the world ’s poor .
The same eight trillion we were told we did n’t have when it was needed by those who wanted educations , basic medical care , decent shelter , a home , hope , a decent life , we had a plenty for the banks and the wealthiest people in the world .
A number of energy and environmental advocates do n’t seem to grasp that the 8 trillion figure – and the monies spent by other nations – are n’t proof that we can build a renewable infrastructure or address peak oil if we really want to – instead , they are what we are doing * instead . *
Yes , nations can print money , but in order to inflate our currency , we ’d have to disentangle ourselves quite violently from the other nations with which we are economically intertwined , and that would have its price too .
That is , our ability to keep bailing is limited – and the 8 trillion now buried in bank vaults and flushed down the toilet is money we do n’t have for future adaptations .
Think about it – we ’re debating 3 / 4 of a trillion dollars for all the American people combined ( and some of that will also make its ways into the coffers of the bank ) – while we ’ve already spent almost 9 times that much on the banks .
300 million Americans get 1/8 or less what the banks get .
What does that say about us ?
And what does it say about the ability and willingness to mobilize funds for things that actually protect human lives ?
So what ’s a doomer chick to do but throw in the towel and her spiked mitts and admit she ’s beat ?
I ca n’t out - doom the Wall Street Journal – Wall Street invented our doom , and who better to describe it .
The old button ” I eat stranger things than this with my breakfast cereal ” is increasingly true – me and my gardens and my ordinary human poverty are just plain dull .
Do n’t worry , I ’m not going to stop writing .
But like Dmitry Orlov ( who did threaten to stop writing , which would have been a tragedy ) , I ’m getting out of the apocalyptic prophetess of doom job .
Like Orlov , I ’m now an observer – hardly impartial , but there ’s no point predicting the future when we ’re living it , and when the song of the apocalypse becomes the universal chorus .

An iPhone - based card - counting system recently turned up in a California Indian casino .
This new application is causing a lot of fuss , and Nevada gaming regulators have issued a general alert about it , warning Las Vegas casinos about its potential use in gameplay .
Want to count cards at a US casino ?
The consensus seems to be that " skilled players " can count cards all they want ; it 's not illegal .
If you do so in Vegas , however , the casinos may choose not to do business with you .
Apparently , casinos will " back off " expert counters , i.e. show them the door , or possibly direct them to a less skill - based , more profitable gaming arena .
I turned to my brother - in - law Lorenzo , the MIT - trained blackjack aficionado for clarification .
" Card counting is n't illegal ( how can thinking be illegal ? ) , " he wrote to me , " but Las Vegas casinos can ( and will ! ) throw you out if you 're too obvious or too successful at it .
You 're playing their game on their turf by their rules , and they do n't need to prove you 've done anything wrong to throw you out and bar you from coming back . "
That 's not the case across the country .
In New Jersey , the case of Uston v. Resorts Internation Hotel Inc was decided in the gambler 's favor , as the state Supreme Court ultimately ruled that Atlantic City casinos could not bar skilled players .
It 's different in Las Vegas — they can bully , harass , and back off customers so long as they stay within certain legal boundaries .
According to Lorenzo , the Nevada casinos are walking a fine line .
He tells me that casinos love the fact that blackjack is a game that is theoretically in the player 's advantage .
This makes it popular and brings in a lot of incompetent players .
At the same time , they hate the fact that a few very skilled people can take a lot of their money .
" They 're not going to throw you or me out when we 're betting $ 2 to $ 5 at a time , " he wrote , " even if we 're counting well , but they 'll throw out the guy who bets $ 2 when the house has an advantage and $ 2,000 when the house is at a disadvantage . "
So when it comes to Las Vegas , while thinking is n't technically illegal , casinos can and will choose to kick you out when you think too much or too well .
But using assistive devices ?
That is definitely illegal pretty much everywhere , whether you 're gaming in NJ , Nevada , or California .
In Nevada , you can count in your head all you want , but the second you start using technological assistance , you 've crossed a line and are committing a felony .
The Indian casino that first discovered the iPhone - based counting system alerted the California Bureau of Gambling control , which in turn sent out alerts to Nevada and other commissions around the country .
In response , Nevada gambling regulators today are warning casinos to be on the alert for iPhone - based card counting utilities .
Nevada takes gambling cheats very seriously .
And this is apparently a very serious counting application .
It operates in several modes , including a " stealth mode " where the screen is blanked , and can be operated by touching different zones on the screen .
It can use up to four separate strategies for card counting .
Although I have n't seen or tried it myself , I am tickled by the ingenuity that apparently went into this app 's design .
In Nevada , each casino makes its own rules regarding the policing of electronic devices at gaming tables .
Obviously not all devices are used to give players advantages .
I 'm sure it 's nice when you can call the wife on your cell phone and say you 'll be a little late returning to the hotel room , for example .
Casinos are well aware of the hazards though .
Harrah 's Entertainment banned the iPhone at the World Series of Poker shortly after the iPhone debuted .
With this latest system exposed and the flexibility and programability of smart - phones on the rise , you can expect more crackdowns on electronic device use near the gaming tables .

Israel seizes land in plan to encircle West Bank town with fence Ma'an news Feb 26 , 2009
Bethlehem � Ma�an �
The Israeli military has issued an order to confiscate farmland in order to build a 295 - meter barbed - wire fence separating the West Bank town of Beit Ummar from an adjacent highway .

Elizabeth Turnbull was planning for Yale grad school and started estimating her future living expenses .
As an incoming Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies student , Elizabeth calculated that she would spend ~ $ 14,000 over two years of school and wanted to do something effective with that money .
So she channeled a little inspiration from Tumbleweed Tiny House and decided to build her own tiny home as economically as possible .
So far , she ’s made incredible progress building the 8′ x 18 ′ modish home on a flatbed trailer .
By the time she ’s done , the off - grid home will price out just over $ 11,000 or so .
And it ’s surprisingly spacious inside , too .
Elizabeth ’s Tiny House will have a sleeping loft , storage loft , study nook , kitchen area , living area , and a bathroom .
When complete , she ’ll tow the entire home to New Haven for the start of the academic year .
You ’ll notice the simple passive design .
During the winter , the side with all the windows will gather sunlight .
During the summer , she ’ll turn the trailer around and leave the slanted roof facing the sun .
Three solar panels will power her computer , lights , and other electronics in the home .
The tiny house has a small shower , composting toilet , and propane to heat the home when necessary .

The Amazing Catacombs in Paris France
source : here
Prior to 1810 the Paris catacombs were known as Paris ’ Montrouge stone quarries .
As with any large city graveyards began to quickly run out of burial space thus an alternative means of disposing of bodies was necessary .
Here you can now walk within a maze of the Paris underground tunnels complete with storage alcoves which go up at least 20 feet and contain millions of bones .
The various sides of these bone piles possess designs which have been arranged with the skulls in a sort of pattern .
Existing twenty meters underground one can find over 6 million former residents of Paris on exhibit .
Among these bones of the deceased are many illustrated texts which create a macabre atmosphere while describe countless chilling events in the chronicles of Paris .
It is here that several Hollywood movies have taken their cue and novels abound concerning the essence of the catacombs .
During the 2nd World War this series of underground caves were exploited as hideaways for members of the French Resistance movement .
With its large area of coverage and its secretive entrances these catacombs proved to be an immense benefit .
The catacombs are unlike anything you may have seen previously .
In a single word they are simply “ Amazing ” .
Although ones first impression is to be astounded after a while it all appears to be the same .
With 6 million bones in plan sight the complete outlook tends to give a spooky type of sight and since they have only a single way to escape you are left with no other alternative other then to keep walking .
The entrance is easily reached via the Paris metro .
When you first arrive at the entrance to the catacombs you just may miss it since it is nothing more then a green color metal hut .
You will transcend many flights of stairs to reach the visitor layer .
These very steps may pose a problem for the elderly people should they be out of shape .
The total number of steps is approximately 80 layers when descending into the tunnel and about 200 when coming back up .
The exit steps are arranged in a small spiral .
You will walk in a long expanse of dark musty tunnel prior to arriving at the bone collections .
Most of the passageways are rather narrow and it will seem like they never end .
If you are a photographer you will be quickly cautioned that no sort of flash photography will be allowed in the catacombs .
Given an opportunity to visit this section of Paris , I would highly recommend this fascinating experience as one you should see .
It represents an awesome chance to witness the thousands of year old caves while strolling past rows upon rows of human bones .
Do n’t miss this tour by any means .

Because the Jackson Family 's collective behavior apparently is n't bizarre enough on its own , Marlon Jackson is backing a slavery theme park and resort in Nigeria .
Does n't this sound fun :
Visitors would be able to visit a replica slave ship and walk the route their shackled ancestors walked before playing a round of golf or relaxing by a pool .
There 's also Jackson
Five tie - in , obviously , including a collection of band memorabilia .
There are also holograms , robots and probably some kind of horribly ill - advised Captain EO - meets - Roots laser movie thing .
The idea is to attract African Americans who want to trace back their roots , and white people looking for the money they were promised on email .
Historians are aghast , and one critic said the proposed development is " like dancing on the graves of dead people , " which totally is n't true .
It 's like building a pricey , zombie - themed nightclub on the graves of dead people , complete with bottle service , and making relatives of the deceased pay an exorbitant cover charge to come visit .
Then you get in and Michael Jackson is dancing with the skeleton of the Elephant Man .
( Except that 's something we 'd actually pay to experience .
Otherwise , same thing . )
UPDATE 5/8/09 : Facebook revised its Terms of Service , aka the “ Statement of Rights and Responsibilities . ”
Here ’s their blog post about it , and here ’s the current policy .
***
With today ’s outrage over Facebook ’s newly altered Terms of Service at its peak , I figured I ’d do a quick comparison of their terms of service as regards user - uploaded content to the terms specified by other social networking sites , just to see if said outrage is fully justified .
It looks as though the finger - pointing at the Bush robots .
txt file was n’t justified , for instance , and I was guilty of spreading that story .
Conclusion ?
Go ahead and be outraged .
Facebook ’s claims to your content are extraordinarily grabby and arrogant .
Here ’s the rundown , which I go through in more detail below :
Facebook apparently wants to keep all its rights to your stuff after you remove it from Facebook , and even after you delete your Facebook account ; they just removed the lines that specified that their rights end when your content comes down .
Nobody else ( of those I looked at ) would dream of that ; mostly they specifically state that their rights to your content end when you remove the content from their site or delete your account .
This one kills me : Facebook claims it can do whatever it wants with your content if you put a Share on Facebook link on your web page .
Unbelievable–and unique , as far as I can tell .
People can post links in Facebook to your content just by copying and pasting the URL , but if you want to save them a few keystrokes by putting a link or a widget on your site , Facebook claims that you ’ve granted them a whole mess of rights .
Count me out .
Other sites point out in their terms of service that you still own your content : Facebook does n’t mention that little fact .
Facebook also neglects to remind you that you ’re giving other Facebook users rights to your Facebook content , too — YouTube , for example , makes it clear that other people besides YouTube have a right to use and spread around the videos you upload .
In general , other sites ’ terms of service just have a more helpful tone .
So let ’s look at what other popular user - generated content sites say about their rights to your stuff :
6.1 MySpace does not claim any ownership rights in the text , files , images , photos , video , sounds , musical works , works of authorship , applications , or any other materials ( collectively , “ Content ” ) that you post on or through the MySpace Services .
After posting your Content to the MySpace Services , you continue to retain any such rights that you may have in your Content , subject to the limited license herein .
By displaying or publishing ( “ posting ” ) any Content on or through the MySpace Services , you hereby grant to MySpace a limited license to use , modify , delete from , add to , publicly perform , publicly display , reproduce , and distribute such Content solely on or through the MySpace Services , including without limitation distributing part or all of the MySpace Website in any media formats and through any media channels , except Content marked “ private ” will not be distributed outside the MySpace Website .
This limited license does not grant MySpace the right to sell or otherwise distribute your Content outside of the MySpace Services .
After you remove your Content from the MySpace Website we will cease distribution as soon as practicable , and at such time when distribution ceases , the license will terminate .
If after we have distributed your Content outside the MySpace Website you change the Content ’s privacy setting to “ private , ” we will cease distribution of such “ private ” Content outside the MySpace Website as soon as practicable after you make the change .
6.2
The license you grant to MySpace is non-exclusive ( meaning you are free to license your Content to anyone else in addition to MySpace ) , fully - paid and royalty - free ( meaning that MySpace is not required to pay you for the use on the MySpace Services of the Content that you post ) , sublicensable ( so that MySpace is able to use its affiliates , subcontractors and other partners such as Internet content delivery networks and wireless carriers to provide the MySpace Services ) , and worldwide ( because the Internet and the MySpace Services are global in reach ) .
See ?
MySpace grants itself a “ limited ” license and carefully spells out what those limits are .
MySpace does a terrific job in that second paragraph especially of explaining what ’s going on , I think .
Maybe your average thirteen - year - old would still need some help , but way to go with the “ human - readable ” language , MySpace .
Getting an explanation about why they need to be able to sublicense the content is terrific , and I ’m sure that if they then tried to sublicense it for other purposes , they ’d be tripped up by their own TOS .
Yahoo !
does not claim ownership of Content you submit or make available for inclusion on the Yahoo !
Services .
However , with respect to Content you submit or make available for inclusion on publicly accessible areas of the Yahoo !
Services , you grant Yahoo !
the following worldwide , royalty - free and non-exclusive license (s ) , as applicable [… ] :
With respect to photos , graphics , audio or video you submit or make available for inclusion on publicly accessible areas of the Yahoo !
Services other than Yahoo !
Groups , the license to use , distribute , reproduce , modify , adapt , publicly perform and publicly display such Content on the Yahoo !
Services solely for the purpose for which such Content was submitted or made available .
This license exists only for as long as you elect to continue to include such Content on the Yahoo !
Services and will terminate at the time you remove or Yahoo !
removes such Content from the Yahoo !
Services .
Yahoo !
makes distinctions between its Groups and other services like Flickr , but that need not concern us here ( Yahoo ! reserves fewer rights to Groups stuff than to Flickr stuff ) .
They start by reminding you that they do n’t own your stuff , then go on to say that they have the right to copy your stuff “ solely for the purpose for which such Content was submitted . ”
In other words , they do n’t grant themselves the right to use it in their advertising , as far as I can tell .
And , sanely , the license ends when you ( or they ) take the content down .
I checked out the Flickr Pro TOS , as well , and there ’s nothing extra in there , whew .
I also love that Flickr makes it very easy to stick a Creative Commons license on your photos , although to be honest I ’m not sure if I ’ve done that with mine .
Must check .
Google claims no ownership or control over any Content submitted , posted or displayed by you on or through Picasa Web Albums .
You or a third party licensor , as appropriate , retain all patent , trademark and copyright to any Content you submit , post or display on or through Picasa Web Albums and you are responsible for protecting those rights , as appropriate .
By submitting , posting or displaying Content on or through Picasa Web Albums , you grant Google a worldwide , non-exclusive , royalty - free license to reproduce , adapt , distribute and publish such Content through Picasa Web Albums , including RSS or other content feeds offered through Picasa Web Albums , and other Google services .
In addition , by submitting , posting or displaying Content which is intended to be available to the general public , you grant Google a worldwide , non-exclusive , royalty - free license to reproduce , adapt , distribute and publish such Content for the purpose of displaying , distributing and promoting Google services .
Google will discontinue this licensed use within a commercially reasonable period after such Content is removed from Picasa Web Albums .
Sounds reasonable .
I do n’t really mind their using my stuff in their advertising , though “ other Google services ” may soon encompass every single conceivable service on the planet .
They , too , stop the license when you take the content down .
For clarity , you retain all of your ownership rights in your User Submissions .
However , by submitting User Submissions to YouTube , you hereby grant YouTube a worldwide , non-exclusive , royalty - free , sublicenseable and transferable license to use , reproduce , distribute , prepare derivative works of , display , and perform the User Submissions in connection with the YouTube Website and YouTube ’s ( and its successors ’ and affiliates ’ ) business , including without limitation for promoting and redistributing part or all of the YouTube Website ( and derivative works thereof ) in any media formats and through any media channels .
You also hereby grant each user of the YouTube Website a non-exclusive license to access your User Submissions through the Website , and to use , reproduce , distribute , display and perform such User Submissions as permitted through the functionality of the Website and under these Terms of Service .
The above licenses granted by you in User Videos terminate within a commercially reasonable time after you remove or delete your User Videos from the YouTube Website .
You understand and agree , however , that YouTube may retain , but not display , distribute , or perform , server copies of User Submissions that have been removed or deleted .
The above licenses granted by you in User Comments are perpetual and irrevocable .
I really like it when these paragraphs start with the helpful information that “ you retain all ownership rights . ”
Also note that YouTube points out that “ You also hereby grant each user of the YouTube Website ” some rights .
Way to look out for the community .
Good job .
Now add the ability for us to put Creative Commons licenses on our videos somewhere other than in the description , okay ?
Thanks .
License and warrant your submissions :
You do not have to submit anything to us , but if you choose to submit something ( including any User generated content , ideas , concepts , techniques and data ) , you must grant , and you actually grant by concluding this Agreement , a nonexclusive , irrevocable , worldwide , perpetual , unlimited , assignable , sublicenseable , fully paid up and royaltyfree right to us to copy , prepare derivative works of , improve , distribute , publish , remove , retain , add , and use and commercialize , in any way now known or in the future discovered , anything that you submit to us , without any further consent , notice and / or compensation to you or to any third parties .
LinkedIn is the one exception to the general conclusion I state above : its language about its rights to your content is at least as strong as Facebook ’s , if not more so .
The thing is that people do n’t upload pictures and videos to Linked In ; the main user - contributed content is the facts in a profile ( where I worked , where I went to school ) .
People usually do n’t mind having that information spread around .
Also , you can tell that LinkedIn is thinking mainly about the suggestions for improvement that people submit ( “ ideas , concepts , techniques ” ) — but still , Linked In would be well - advised to revise .
1 . We claim no intellectual property rights over the material you provide to the Twitter service .
Your profile and materials uploaded remain yours .
You can remove your profile at any time by deleting your account .
This will also remove any text and images you have stored in the system .
2 . We encourage users to contribute their creations to the public domain or consider progressive licensing terms .
Is n’t that sweet ?
Granted , the only stuff people contribute to Twitter are their little 140 - character tweets , plus a profile pic or two — these terms do n’t cover what you post to TwitPic , for instance .
But Twitter wants you to know that your stuff is yours , and it wants you to share your stuff with others .
Twitter does n’t reserve to itself the right to use your tweets in its promotional campaigns — does Twitter even do any self - promotion ?
They hardly need to ; the New York Times has certainly been giving them enough press lately .
You hereby grant Facebook an irrevocable , perpetual , non-exclusive , transferable , fully paid , worldwide license ( with the right to sublicense ) to ( a ) use , copy , publish , stream , store , retain , publicly perform or display , transmit , scan , reformat , modify , edit , frame , translate , excerpt , adapt , create derivative works and distribute ( through multiple tiers ) , any User Content you ( i ) Post on or in connection with the Facebook Service or the promotion thereof subject only to your privacy settings or ( ii ) enable a user to Post , including by offering a Share Link on your website and ( b ) to use your name , likeness and image for any purpose , including commercial or advertising , each of ( a ) and ( b ) on or in connection with the Facebook Service or the promotion thereof .
Yeah , so I took the Facebook icon out of my Sociable WordPress widget .
All my stuff here has a Creative Commons license , so I ’ve already allowed everyone including Facebook to use my stuff for “ non-commercial ” purposes anyway ; it ’s not quite clear what counts as a “ commercial ” purpose in a Creative Commons license , granted ( though they ’re working on clarifying the term ) , but any use that Facebook would make would probably be commercial .
I do n’t even mind all commercial uses : I do n’t really care if they want to use my profile picture to show that the people who use Facebook are really sexy and good - looking .
But the stuff on my blog does not become Facebook “ User Content ” if I put a link that allows people to share it on Facebook .
Come off it .
United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon has demanded a full explanation from Israel regarding its attacks on UN schools and other facilities during the 22 - day war in the Gaza Strip , which he called “ outrageous . ”
After the statement by Secretary General Ban , the United Nations Security Council is said to be likely to release a statement of its own also demanding the Israeli government explain its actions .
Ban , who has just completed a tour of the Gaza Strip , says he expects that “ those responsible will be held accountable for their actions . ”
During the war , which killed over 1,400 Palestinians , the Israeli military struck numerous UN facilities , but perhaps the most durable image was its January 6 attack on the al - Fahoura girls ’ school in Jabalya refugee camp , which at the time was housing hundreds of displaced civilians .
The attack killed 46 and wounded 55 others .
The Israeli government changed its official story regarding the attack several times , but none of its stories seemed consistent with events on the ground or even with one another .
The United Nations Relief and Works Agency was also hit on January 15 , with white phosphorus munitions , and while that attack did n’t cause the enormous casualties of some of the others , it destroyed several tons of humanitarian aid in a warehouse .
Israel likewise never seemed to settle on an official explanation for this attack .
San Bernardino County hosts the military 's most cherished clubhouse , Ft. Irwin , and several other bases , active and closed .
The county population is rich in military denizens , their derelicts , offspring , misfits and buffs .
With the consequent prevalence of the classic sociopathy found in these people , predation , exploitation , corruption and virtual tyranny have spread throughout our courts , law enforcement and government .
Discuss the disgraceful prison and military industrial complexes here .
Since Turkish ice cream , or dondurma , is much tougher and chewier than American ice cream or gelato , it lends itself well to being stretched and played around with .
In this video taken at an ice cream stand in Istanbul , the vendor makes a show while paddling a towering chocolate and nut - covered ice cream cone for his customer by repeatedly taking it away and pretending to let it drop .
I 'd enjoy this show the first time around , but after a while I could see myself thinking , " Gimmethedamnicecream . "
Still , after learning about dondurma , my interest in visiting Istanbul has jumped about 500 % .
Watch the video after the jump .

ANALYSIS / OPINION :
COMMENTARY :
President Barack Obama ’s campaign theme should have been , “ The more things change , the more they stay the same . ”
The personality - driven media has juxtaposed Mr. Obama ’s pledge to clean the nation ’s Augean Stables of rich lobbyists and insiders who profited on special access to the corridors of power ; and , his appointments or nominations of delinquent taxpayers to his Cabinet ( with jurisdiction over the Internal Revenue Service ) , and appointment of a mega - lobbyist for a defense contractor as deputy secretary of defense .
But Mr. Obama ’s more alarming betrayal concerns the imperial powers of his office , which he inherited from the Bush - Cheney duumvirate .
He has either embraced or acquiesced in every one of their usurpations or abuses ( some perpetrated with congressional collaboration ) .
Then - Sen. Obama had assailed the Bush - Cheney invocation of the non-constitutional state secrets privilege to block litigation by victims of egregious constitutional violations seeking damages from the wrongdoers .
The case of Binyam Mohammed , an Ethiopian native , is exemplary .
He sued a subsidiary of Boeing for arranging flights to execute the Bush - Cheney “ extraordinary rendition ” program .
It entails kidnapping terrorism suspects based on the president ’s say - so alone and transporting them to other countries for torture .
Mr. Mohammed alleged that after his kidnap and transport to Morocco , “ he was routinely beaten , suffering broken bones and , on occasion , loss of consciousness .
His clothes were cut off with a scalpel and the same scalpel was then used to make incisions on his body , including his penis .
A hot stinging liquid was then poured into open wounds on his penis where he had been cut .
He was frequently threatened with rape , electrocution and death . ”
United States laws make torture a criminal offense irrespective of the nationality of the violator or the place of the crime .
Last week before the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit , President Obama echoed the position of Bush - Cheney that the state secrets privilege required dismissal of Mr. Mohammed ’s suit .
In other words , individual constitutional rights of the highest order should be sacrificed on the altar of national security .
At the same time , Mr. Obama was deciding to defend the arch - defender of torture , former Deputy Assistant Attorney General John Yoo , from a suit brought by Jose Padilla .
The complaint alleges that Mr. Yoo concocted the legal justification for detaining and harshly interrogating Padilla as an “ enemy combatant ” without accusation or trial .
( The United States later recanted its enemy combatant allegation ) .
Mr. Obama invoked the state secrets privilege a second time last week to block litigation challenging the legality of the Bush - Cheney “ Terrorist Surveillance Program ” ( TSP ) that he had assailed as a senator .
For five years , the TSP targeted American citizens on American soil for electronic surveillance on the president ’s say - so alone to gather foreign intelligence in contravention of the warrant requirement of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ( FISA ) .
Intentional violations are federal felonies .
Candidate Obama faulted the Bush - Cheney reign for tolerating or encouraging lawlessness .
The president is obliged under the Constitution to take care that the laws are faithfully executed .
Waterboarding has been prosecuted as torture since the Spanish - American War of 1898 .
Former Republican Secretary of Homeland Security Tom Ridge concurs that waterboarding is torture .
Ditto for Attorney General Eric H. Holder .
Former President Bush and Vice President Cheney have acknowledged their authorization for waterboarding at least three detainees .
The United States torture prohibition makes no exceptions for times of war ( although mistake of law is a defense ) .
Mr. Obama , however , has virtually renounced faithfully enforcing the laws against torture ( and the criminal prohibitions of FISA and kidnapping ) as regards the former president and vice president .
Mr. Obama ’s inaction is tantamount to a pardon , but which uncourageously evades the political accountability that President Gerald Ford accepted for pardoning former President Richard M. Nixon .
Pardons , moreover , require the recipient ’s concession of criminal culpability , and prevent the violations from becoming legal precedents that would lie around like loaded weapons ready for use by any White House successor who claims an urgent need .
Then - Sen. Obama descried the Bush - Cheney invocation of executive privilege to prevent former White House officials Karl Rove and Harriet Miers from even responding to congressional subpoenas for testimony about the firings of nine United States attorneys .
That extravagant and unprecedented claim would have enabled President Nixon to muzzle his Watergate nemesis , former White House counsel John Dean , from testifying before the Senate Watergate Committee about Oval Office conversations implicating the president in obstruction of justice .
Mr. Obama , however , is now hedging over whether to defend Mr. Rove ’s non-responsiveness to a new congressional subpoena .
President Obama has left undisturbed the bulwark of other Bush - Cheney usurpations or constitutional excesses : the Military Commissions Act of 2006 ; the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act Amendments
Act of 2008 , which eviscerates the Fourth Amendment ; the Status of Forces Agreement with Iraq concluded by Bush - Cheney as an executive agreement ( despite its placement of U.S. troops under foreign command ) to evade Senate scrutiny as a treaty requiring a two - thirds majority ; and , President Bush ’s hundreds of signing statements .
If the American people and Congress do not wake up from their Obama infatuation , presidential powers will soon be indistinguishable from King George III ’s that provoked the 1776 Declaration of Independence .

AFFIRMATION OF AUTHORITY OF THE ARMED FORCES OF THE UNITED STATES TO DETAIN COVERED PERSONS PURSUANT TO THE AUTHORIZATION FOR USE OF MILITARY FORCE .
( a ) IN GENERAL .- Congress affirms that the authority of the President to use all necessary and appropriate force pursuant to the Authorization for Use of Military Force ( Public Law 107-40 ; 50 U.S.C. 1541 note ) includes the authority for the Armed Forces of the United States to detain covered persons ( as defined in subsection ( b ) ) pending disposition under the law of war .
( b ) COVERED PERSONS . -
A covered person under this section is any person as follows : ( 1 ) A person who planned , authorized , committed , or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11 , 2001 , or harbored those responsible for those attacks .
( 2 ) A person who was a part of or substantially supported al - Qaeda , the Taliban , or associated forces that are engaged in hostilities against the United States or its coalition partners , including any person who has committed a belligerent act or has directly supported such hostilities in aid of such enemy forces .
National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012
It would appear Prof .
Bazant and others mentioned below are covered persons to be detained as per above US law .
You wonder why they are still at large .
Is the President or military sleeping ?
Anders Björkman Americans do n't know any more about physics and structural architecture and engineering than the Soviet population and Stalin knew about genetics .
Today " Lysenkoism " is used as a metaphor to denote the corruption of science in behalf of a social , political , or ideological purpose .

Welcome !
All information about New York skyscrapers collapsing from top down - tops crushing intact bottoms - full of people 11 September 2001 in fountains of smoke and dust as shown live on all US TV channels and then disappearing in little heaps of rubble was 100 % false !
The US government had of course produced similar , stupid shows before - 1945 and 1969 .
There is first no way an airplane of aluminium can penetrate a wall of steel columns of the top of a skyscraper and explode inside .
The steel columns backed by floors are too strong and the floors will slice the airplane 's body into small pieces , dislocate the wings and most parts should bounce away and drop down on the ground .
But this did n't happened .
Mysterious planes were twice recorded on film slicing the walls of skyscrapers with their wings on 911 and disappearing through a hole followed by balls of fires !
Second there is no way that a little top part of a structure can crush the intact bottom of same structure by gravity or by controlled demolition ( unless using e.g. 25 off 300 kg composition H6 charges fitted just outside the elevator shafts in the core at every fourth floor and triggered from top down ) and become ... dust (! ) ... as shown on all available videos and footage , e.g. left !
The footage is fake !
So all footage and videos showing airplanes flying through skyscraper walls and the skyscrapers structure becoming fountains of dust live on TV were produced before hand !
By whom ?
By the terrorists responsible for the destructions , of course .
Reason is simple : Structures always collapse by gravity from bottom up and do not end up as dust !
And airplanes cannot slice through skyscraper walls !
This web page of mine explains all about the lies of the US 911 NIST investigation .
I pay anyone € 1 milllion proving me wrong !

1. WTC 1/2 - Learning from ship collisions by Anders Björkman ( M.Sc ) ,
The WTC 1/2 Towers could not have been one - way crushed down and destroyed by its weak , light weight upper part C dropping on the much heavier and stronger bottom part A keeping part C in place on 9/11/2001 as reported by NYT and seen ' live on ( faked ) TV ' .
A light , weak top part crushing a heavy , strong bottom part of a structure as suggested by evil magicians in the USA cannot happen in the real world .
It is also explained at 1.18.50 in DVD2 - a film about the 911 incident .
Can actually hijacked jets making holes in the weak tops of towers , destroy the complete , stronger , intact , not on fire towers below as suggested by evil people in the USA ?
Or was NYT publishing a lie ?
More faked photos were published by the NYT Staff ... and they got a prize !
According basic structural damage analysis no structure can destroy itself by its light top part dropping on the lower stronger part .
Why did NYT suggest the contrary ?
Watching TV ?
It is very easy to fake a plane crashing into a skyscraper !
Like this !
It is just a question of various layers on a video !
And to add some scripted comments !
It is like composing music .
But when a plane collides with a skyscraper there should be plenty of plane parts bouncing off the skyscraper ... but there were none !
It appears that all videos and pictures showing the destruction of WTC and the rubble afterwards are simply faked by the terrorists !
Left is a plan of the WTC 1 - 7 complex .
Above is a photo of the WTC 1 - 7 complex after complete destruction 2001 .
So what really happened ?
Did planes flown by Arabs slice into and land inside the WTC 1/2 towers to start destruction ?
Did the WTC 1/2 towers suddenly become dust by a secret weapon ?
What happened ?
Imagine that !
The real terrorists faked the whole show using TV and media ... and blamed some Arabs !
Of course similar things have been done before .
1945 ! 1969 !
It is media fakery propaganda !
I am convinced that the POTUS 2001 ordered the falsifications of all 911 investigations of all kind , incl .
the structural analysises done by NIST , and that the fakery should be kept secret forever by an Executive order to this effect backed up by laws to prevent any whistle blowers to tell the truth as described below .
I am convinced that the United States and key allies and partners 2017 use disinformation and other propaganda tools to undermine the national security objectives of Sweden , France and other countries deemed vulnerable to foreign propaganda and disinformation campaigns .
Therefore there are many web sites explaining that it is perfectly normal that a weak top of steel structures can crush by gravity the much stronger bottom part keeping it in place .
Such web sites are simply made by terrorists using media and Internet to fool the public !
Photo right ( I have added C and A ) that you find on the Internet is often used to illustrate a crush down global collapse by gravity of a skyscraper that allegedly took place twice on 9 - 11 .
Many similar photos exist .
It is suggested that a small , structurally weak top part C , hidden by the smoke , has got loose due to fire / local failures ( plane making hole ! ) up top and is dropping down by gravity on the much bigger and stronger structural bottom part A and that smoke , dust , debris - thousands of small pieces - and big , loose steel wall panels are ejected sideways in all directions as a result , while bottom part A is crushed down into rubble B , also hidden by smoke .
The picture , like all similar pictures or videos , is a fake !
It is just a stupid animation created by terrorists using computer generated images by Photoshop or Blast Code or similar or a advanced controlled demomition destruction .
The top part is simply erased and smoke ( from a likewise fake atomic bomb explosion ! ) , dust and debris added Hollywood style in different layers - live on TV !
Easy to show and prove .
The picture is really ridiculous .
Small top C crushing big bottom A = ridiculous !
Prove me wrong and win € 1 .

Smoke and debris are false . )
A crazy , criminal civil engineering professor Z. Bazant and supporter of terrorism explained the brainwash the same day : When an air plane a ) has just hit the weak , light top C of a skyscraper A and put it on fire b ) , the skyscraper suddenly collapses , c , d , e ) from top C down through bottom A in a fountain of debris , it is suggested that the plane and fire caused the progressive collapse of the strong , heavy bottom A , as shown right :
The wrong information - brainwash - that manipulates you , is difficult to resist , if others believe , or are made believe , the same thing , e.g. by the TV and media .
What makes such events most distinctive is their self - insulating quality .
Engineers that believe that structures collapse from top , because they saw it on television , will not accept engineering principles to the contrary - that it is physically impossible .
I have prepared a Power Point Presentation ( you have to open it with Microsoft PowerPoint ) from footage shown " live on TV " how the WTC1 ( North Tower ) roof ( # 110 ) of top part C drops six floors to floor # 104 , while at same time nothing happens to the structure below floor # 92 , i.e. bottom part A . Fake smoke on top of the roof also drops six floors , while more smoke is added to simulate ejection of smoke of the top six floors being compressed .
Officially the complete top part C remained intact and crushed the intact bottom structure .
Actually the footage is simple Computer Generated Images done by the terrorists to impress the president , CIA , FBI and other stupid observers .
I wonder why any US terrorism analysts like FBI can not see that !
Ca n't they distinguish a fake photo or video from a real one ?
Ca n't FBI analyze structural damages ?
I pay anybody € 1 000 000 : - to produce a real photo or video of a structure collapsing by gravity from the top !
To assist anybody to spot a trick , animated , US ( propaganda ) film you are invited to watch this .
On a sunny day ( 1953 ? ) a number of US warships are gathered at sea around a spot - ground zero !
- to watch an atomic , nuclear bomb going off ... which happens suddenly : 60 kg of uranium 235 is in very short time , nanoseconds , transformed into pure energy corresponding to 20 000 ton of TNT we are supposed to believe : the atmosphere is heated to 100 000°C and compressed to 100 000 bar producing a heat / pressure blast wave ( apart from a dirty mushroom cloud ) that progresses at 3 000 km /h !
But the few clouds in the sky and the 10 + ships on the water are not affected at all !!!
- reason being that the ' explosion ' is fake - an early Hollywood animation .
Here is a plane colliding with WTC2 .
But in five different ways as shown live on TV !
Poor animations !

You wonder why a big wall panel falling on side always is followed by a trail of smoke / dust .
And why the smoke on top looks the same !
Copy / paste of various layers of animations ?
In reality - the REAL world - no tower or structure can ever get destroyed or collapse from top down (! ) as seen .
In the REAL world the towers were destroyed from bottom up - but no footage of it is available .
But trust me - the only way to destroy the towers is ... using explosives of some kind .
So Obama killed the wrong person 1st May 2011 .
Osama could not have destroyed the WTC - towers .
Right is another photo of similar type , i.e. a fake ( from the NIST reports ) showing steel wall panels and debris falling from the top of the South Tower , WTC2 , while the bottom part of WTC2 in the background is still intact .
The picture is evidently a fake !
It is just another stupid animation created by same terrorists and Photoshop !
And dishonest photographers .
Terrorists !
Imagine - there is a small fire up top in a skyscraper and suddenly the four solid perimeter walls - steel panels - are ripped off six floors apart , i.e. at two locations top / bottom and are pushed out and then fall down on the streets below followed by clouds of dust and a photographer ( terrorist ? ) snaps a picture of it - just when the panels pass by ... while the bottom of the skyscraper is still intact !
Unbelievable in my view !
It is of course impossible to snap such a picture .
But there are people making fake pictures .
They are of course terrorists !
And FBI or any US authority does nothing about it .
Amazing .
FBI does not react !
All these photos and videos of the destruction are taken from far away ground by suspect photographers using teleobjectives .
Big parts - steel wall panels - dropping from skyskraper = ridiculous !
Prove me wrong and win € 1 .
000 .
000 :- ( Note - photo is evidently a fake ! )
Fake photo of top part turned into dust dropping down outside an intact bottom part .
Evidently a top part turned into dust cannot crush an intact bottom structure
There exists no close up footage taken by helicopters of the destructions themselves and just before for scientific verification of the damages .
This is very strange and clear evidence that what was shown ' live on TV ' was a hoax of grand proportions .
It is therefore not surprising that an identical ( or slightly ' repaired ' (! ) upper right corner ) steel wall panel pops up on another photo right attributed to alcoholic NY photograper Richard Drew , AP .
I do not like Richard Drew , AP .
He cannot explain how he managed to snap a falling wall steel panel at 100 mph .
Has he a drinking problem ?
Now the steel wall panel drops on the Marriott hotel in downtown NY !
But it is just amateurish Photoshop !
Like all terrorist photos of the ' collapses ' .
A skyscraper can only get destroyed from bottom up !
A skyscraper can never collapse from top down !
Why is described below !
A false FEM decription of a structural collapse is shown here .
US authorities and terrorists believe that structural components like beams are just ripped apart ... by gravity ... and fly away !
Sorry GWB and Condi - you do not fool me !

Another ( faked ! ) photo , right , of a dropping wall panel of WTC2 is from a fake video by Christian Martin , NBC : Does n't people know that walls are not falling off tops of buildings and that filming such non-events is suspicious ?
How a skyscraper destroys itself from top down (! ) is described by US terrorists in Chapter 9 of NIST Report 1 - 6 ( http://wtc.nist.gov/NCSTAR1/PDF/NCSTAR%201-6.pdf) .
Every essential piece of information in that report is of course false .
Imagine that !
USA publishes a report how a skyscraper destroys itself from top on 9 - 11 and everything is faked !
Does n't the authors of the report know that no structure can destroy itself from top down by gravity ?
And why illustrate the report with fake photos of falling wall panels ?
Of course , it fools plenty of people but not the real experts .
Big part , ripped off wall panel again , dropping from skyscraper = ridiculous !

000 :- ( Note - video is stupidly faked by Christian Martin , NBC ! )
This presentation explains why a structure cannot destroy itself from top down by gravity , i.e. there is too little energy available to destroy the lower , stronger structure ... and the bottom part of WTC1 is 10 times stronger than the top part .
That 's why houses and towers never globally collapse from top down .
The USA is simply fooling the world .
It will take 30 minutes to read the presentation !
Analysis of the seismic waves emitted near the time of the plane impacts and at the moments of the collapses and recorded at stations in New York and four neighboring states on September 11 , 2001 , indicate that WTC1 and WTC2 , respectively were brought down by controlled demolition .
The author is a naval architect with 40 years of steel structural design experience including structural damage analysis and maintenance and repairs of steel structures .
He has investigated the structural damage from many ship collisions .
The destruction of WTC 1 , a plane colliding with a steel framed tower ( as described here ) and what follows , e.g. weak upper part of WTC 1 dropping on / impacting lower , stronger structure , is in many respects similar to a collision between two steel ships - one small and one big !
At the moment of contact of A ) the ' WTC 1 upper part and lower structure ' or B ) ' two ships in collision ' , a certain momentum ( mass times velocity ) , kinetic energy ( momentum times velocity divided by 2 ) and forces ( energy divided by displacement ) have to be considered .
All structural elements involved are subject to displacements and local failures due to the forces applied ; energy is absorbed and consumed , friction forces between failed / displaced elements in contact develop , forces and loads are re-distributed , momentums are reduced as outer forces are applied on the parts and the environment and the destruction is always arrested after a while .
All kinetic energy of the collision is transformed into heat and the momentum is transmitted to ground / Earth ( very big mass part of the collision ) .
Many people ask how were the towers destroyed if they were not crushed from top down by gravity .
The top down crush seen on TV was just an animation of computer generated images , CGI , done by Hollywood .
The 110 floors steel frame WTC1&2 towers were brought down by controlled demolition , like the 28 floors tall Biltmore Hotel , October 1977 :
" Seconds after the final warning signal blared Sunday afternoon at a downtown redevelopment site in Oklahoma City , precisely placed explosive charges dropped a 28 - story building almost in its tracks .
When it fell , the 245 - ft - high structure became the tallest steel - frame building to be demolished with explosives .
... CDI placed 991 separate charges , about 800 lbs. of explosives in all , on seven floors from the basement to the 14th floor and detonated them over a five - second interval .
CDI 's detonation sequence aimed to drop the building in a southerly direction in what is called a controlled progressive collapse in order to lay out the demolished structure to ease removal of debris . "
The result was a big heap of steel frames showing that explosives had been used , so all footage of the rubble was faked too using CGI .
2. Structural damage analysis
It is not a static or dynamic solid mechanics problem !
It is a structural damage analysis problem easy to solve !
The upper part of WTC 1 and its roof can only apply forces on the lower structure elements that the upper part can itself withstand in the first place .
As the upper part and the lower structure of WTC 1 have identical structures , the upper part cannot destroy the lower structure of WTC1 in a top - down collapse .
In ship collisions , where different types of structure come into contact , the situation is slightly different but identical principles of analysis apply .
Both structural parts deform and maybe damage each other .
A roof remote from the collision interface cannot just disappear !
What happened to the smaller upper part and its roof of WTC 1 colliding with / dropping on (? ) the bigger lower part on 911 can be seen on photos below ( origin of photos is Internet videos and reliability cannot be guaranteed ; footage is obviously manipulated ) .
Try to follow the roof that does not contactr anything :
Fig. A1 - The upper part C ( floors 97 - 110 + roof + mast ) rests on the lower part !
Destruction has not started .
Roof is intact .
At right insert is shown upper part C in original position .
Fig. A2 - Destruction and collision (! ) have started !!
The upper part C ( floors 97 - 110 + roof + mast ) ( 95 % air ) is destroyed ( using Photoshop ! ) , while roof line and mast move down 5 floors or 18 - 19 meters .
It , the upper part C incl .
roof , should however remain intact and not get smaller and it should now crush down intact , strong WTC 1 lower structure according US authorities !
The animators are doing a lousy job !
Fig. A3 - The upper part C ( floors 97 - 110 + roof + mast ) is completely destroyed and turned into dust , i.e. removed by Photoshop , but mast can still be seen .
But where is the roof ?
It should be intact !!
Debris is ejected sideways at high velocity .
This is obvious fake animation - top Photoshopped and smoke added !
Fig. A4 - The WTC 1 lower , intact , strong structure top part explodes ( LOL ) in a cascade of debris and dust !
The upper part C roof , and mast is fully destroyed or removed / turned into dust and cannot produce what we see !
It looks as if a bomb has gone off inside WTC 1 blowing debris sideways .
No upper part C with intact roof is crushing down anything here , i.e. what you see is a Photoshopped ( computer graphic image ) animation .
Fig. A5 - More debris is thrown out sideways ( more bombs go off ! ) and smoke is ejected upwards !
Evidently not a result of the upper part C + roof being intact and crushing down lower structure as per US authorities .
It , the upper part C + roof , has already disappeared or gone up in Photoshopped smoke and dust .
The animators add more smoke and dust for effect !
Fig. A6 - There is no sign of an intact upper part C crushing WTC 1 !
Why does US authorities suggest that a skyscraper can be destroyed by a small top upper part C one - way crushing down (! ) much stronger , bigger structure below by gravity and fire up top ?
Anybody can see on animated photos above that WTC1 is blown apart from top down in a simple animation and that the upper part C is turned into dust first .
It cannot happen in reality , i.e. what we see is an animation , Hollywood style .
It was also shown ' live on TV ' in USA on all five major TV channels .
Imagine that !
Fake footage was shown live on TV on 911 !
Actually an upper part C and its roof crushing anything would have been impossibe , because Björkman 's axiom ( see below ) regarding structural damage analysis of identical structures in collision says :
A smaller , upper part of an isotropic or composite 3 - D structure , when dropped on and impacting a greater part of same structure by gravity , cannot one - way crush down the greater , lower part of the structure .
The upper part C and its roof should in fact have remained stuck up top on say floor # 94 , if some local failures due to fire occured there !
The roof far away from the collision interface cannot just disappear after a few seconds .
What was seen and recorded above is pure show or terror business - choreographed for maximum exposure , maximum emotional effect , and maximum replay drama .
What could have been more dramatic than what the Americans saw - over and over and over again - on 911 ?
But physically and from a structural damage analysis point of view the structural destruction is not possible .
3 . The Björkman axiom explained
The Björkman axiom can be better understood by looking at what happens when two objects C and A collide inelastically , i.e. the objects are deformed / damaged in an isolated space ( in some simple , numerical examples ) :
We start with two objects C and A of same mass ( and other structural properties ) .
Note how the velocity of the moving part C changes ( is reduced ) at collision !
C has mass m = 1 kg and is moving at velocity v = 10 m/s and its kinetic energy ( mv² / 2 ) is 50 J and its momentum ( mv ) is 10 kgm /s .
A has mass 1 kg but is stationary ( 0 energy and momentum ) .
After inelastic collision C with A in a closed space we assume both objects move at velocity 5 m/s - momentum 10 kgm/s is conserved - and then we observe that the kinetic energy of A+C is only 25 J .
Note that moving part C slowed down from 10 to 5 m/s in this inelastic collision !
Where did the 25 J go ?
( In an elastic collision A gets velocity 10 m/s and C becomes stationary and no energy and momentum is lost ) .
If an inelastic collision really can take place in a closed , isolated space as suggested ; mass C 1 kg/10 m/s/ 50 J/ 10 kgm /s hits stationary mass A 1 kg /0/0/0 and both ( C+A ) proceeds at 5 m/s ( glued together ? ) after collision thus with constant momentum 10 kgm /s but only with 25 J kinetic energy , the missing 25 J energy evidently was transformed into , e.g. heat , deformations , failures and gluing of C and A at the inelastic collision .
12.5 J/kg can really locally transform / modify / glue C and / or A in many ways , but it depends on the structural and material properties of C and A .
The difference between an elastic and inelastic collision in closed space is that , in the latter , structure is modified and kinetic energy is transformed into heat .
Momentum is always conserved .
Now lets study an example of the axiom .
C is the smaller part and remains at 1 kg and A becomes the bigger part !
Let 's say that A is 9 times bigger - 9 kg - than C and that C+A ( 10 kg ) proceeds at only 1 m/s after collision / glued together in a closed space ( momentum 10 kgm /s is conserved ) and that you lose 45 J in the collision or only 4.5 J/kg on A+C together .
Note that moving part C now reduces speed from 10 to 1 m/s in order to transmit energy .
However , if the 45 J energy used to transform / glue the objects is split 50/50 between C and A , then 22.5 J/kg is applied on small part C and only 2.5 J/kg is applied on big part A. Reason for this is that the contact forces between C and A are equal at contact .
In this case and , if C and A , has same structure / material / properties and are subject to identical forces , actually pressures or stresses , C breaks up long before A in an inelastic collision , as small C must absorb 9 times more energy than big A .
The axiom suggests that similar things happens when two objects collide in an open space , where A may be fixed to , e.g. ground , e.g. like WTC 1 on 911 .
It means that you cannot crush an isotropic or composite 3 - D structure A by a part C of itself ( C = 1/9 A ) by dropping part C on A using gravity .
Part C either bounces ( elastic collision ) on A or gets damaged ( inelastic collision ) in contact with A and is stopped by A that is also damaged a little .
It is quite basic and all due to forces / pressures / energy applied and that the two parts have identical structure and material .
Actual materials , size and particulars of the elements of the structure A does n't matter the least .
Part C of A cannot destroy A , as C must absorb much more energy per mass unit than A in the inelastic collision .
Thus no structures , 1 , 2 or 5 meters tall , or 100 , 200 or 500 meters tall exist that will one - way crush down , when a small part C is dropped on the bigger part A below .
And everytime a small , upper part C collides with a stationary big , lower part A , small C loses most of its velocity and stops !
If C does not lose velocity at all , as seen on 911 , there is no collision !
( It is a controlled demolition of some sort - C is destroyed first followed by A - from top down - and impossible to show on video / photo ) .
However , various people , i.a.
Bazant and Seffen ( apart from Usama Bin Laden , Condoleezza Rice , GW Bush and similar clowns ) , which will be further described below in parts I , III and V of this paper propose otherwise .
They suggest that what they describe as one - way crushing or progressive collapse takes place as follows :
First , after impact , upper part C of a building A does not lose any velocity but increases it due gravity (! ) and during the collapse there is a transfer of mass (? ) from the stationary building , lower part A , to the moving top section , part C , due to deformation and local failures of structural elements in part A only - a layer of rubble , part B , attached to part C is formed , which is a function of displaced distance downwards .
Second , the stationary building , lower part A , lamely resists the motion of the top , upper section , part C , and its rubble layer , part B , but can not stop it .
C and B just increase (! ) their speed .
After a few seconds the building C+A is just rubble B from top down .
Or in other words ; just drop a little piece C of a structure A you want to destroy on A and C destroys A .
4 . After a few seconds the building parts C+A are just rubble B from top down !
The Bazant & Co crush - down theory applied to a structure consisting of five assemblies of structural elements - one upper part C and four lower parts A ; All parts consists 95 % of air .
Each part has height h .
Thus total structure has height 5 h .
(1) Lower parts A carries upper part C of the structure statically with a FoS > 1 ( actually > 3 so that part C will not collapse by itself before start ) .
Primary load bearing elements make up < 1 % of the structure volume .
Upper part C is then dropped on top part A and one way crush - down , suggested by Bazant & Co , starts .
The suggested reason is that upper part C can apply sufficient energy to destroy elements in part A and compress them into rubble part B without destroying itself .
It is of course crazy !
Part C can not apply energy to destroy part A without destroying itself !
(2) POUFF !!
Upper part C has crushed top part A into rubble part B A/4 ;
The density of part B rubble is 4 times the density of C and A according Bazant .
Part C has dropped 3/4 h . Part C remains intact according to Bazant & Co .
In reality it cannot happen but Bazant & Co suggest otherwise !
(3) POUFF !!
Upper part C has crushed two top parts A into rubble part B A/2 ; Part C has dropped 1.5 h!
The rubble B assists the crushing of part A .
(4) POUFF !!
Upper part C has crushed three top parts A into rubble part B 3A/4 ; Part C has dropped 2.25 h .
The rubble B assists the crushing of part A .
(5) POUFF !!
Upper part C has crushed all four parts A into rubble part B = one part A ; Part C has dropped 3 h .
The rubble B assists the crushing of part A .
(6) POUFF !!
Rubble part B (! ) has crushed up ( ? ) upper part C into rubble from below .
Parts A and C with density 0.25 have become 100 % rubble of height 1.25 h and ' rubble ' density 1 . ( 7 ) The rubble then spills out on the ground POUFF !! , according Bazant & Co ( and is more compressed to density > 1 ? ) .
Evidently no structure goes POUFF !!
POUFF !!
POUFF !!
POUFF !!
POUFF !!
from top down when you drop a small top piece on it .
The basic errors with these suggestions are simply that no transfer of mass can occur between parts A and C due to a rubble layer , part B , being formed and accelerated and that part A evidently can arrest the motion of C in various ways .
Bazant and Seffen are like the stalinist scientist (!) Lyssenko in the 1930's .
Their theories cannot be verified scientifically by laboratory and field experiments under controlled conditions ; they just make up fantasy theories ( to support terrorism ! ) .
Actually , you can fly in as many planes as you like in the tops of WTC 1 and 2 but the lower structure of WTC 1 and 2 will not be crushed down by the tops ever !
Structures like WTC 1 and 2 cannot collapse from top down !
To destroy a structure you have to do it from bottom up ( controlled / planned demolition ) removing elements at the bottom or step by step applying energy locally .
Fig. A7 - A building A with a top part C becomes rubble B due to progressive collapse and crush down of A by C according to false theories of Bazant and Seffen developed after 11 September 2001 .
Evidently a small top part cannot crush a bigger bottom part of same structure only due to gravity !

It is quite simple to learn what happens in collisions or impacts in open space or when different structures are really being crushed !
Rule one is not to crush yourself by anything even if gravity alone will not suffice to crush anything completely .
You have to check more !
And stay alive .
5 . Just drop anything on something Start with a solid rubber ball , mass m ( kg ) and drop it on the floor from height h = 3.7 meters height = the height that WTC 1 upper part is assumed to drop .
The ball free falls with acceleration g ( 9.81 m/s² ) due to gravity , makes contact with the floor and normally bounces .
The little ball was not rigid and deformed upon contact with the floor .
Why ?
The strong floor applied a force on the solid rubber ball , so that it deformed , absorbed some of the kinetic energy E involved ( E = m*h*g ) and then released it and bounced up .
Evidently the ball also applied a force on the floor that also deformed , absorbed the remainder of the energy involved ; maybe the floor vibrated a little .
This is Newton 's third law at work .
Note the change / direction of velocity of the ball !
Then do the same thing with a solid sphere of steel .
Drop it on the floor .
If the floor is strong enough , the same thing will happen as with a rubber ball !
The steel sphere bounces .
If the floor is not strong enough , i.e. it cannot produce a force big enough to deform the steel sphere , so that it bounces back , the floor will be damaged - a hole is formed in it , and the steel sphere drops through the hole at reduced speed and contacts something else below , or the floor is just partially damaged ... and catches the steel ball , i.e. arrests it .
Note the the change of velocity of the sphere of steel .
Finally drop anything weak ( an egg or a lemon ? ) on something strong !
PLAFSH !
The weak anything ( the egg or lemon ! ) is crushed against the strong something !
It 's velocity becomes zero !
Do n't forget that !
This is what happens when different structures collide .
Try to compress a lemon with another lemon .
What happens ?
Both lemons compress .
This happens when identical structures collide .
Drop rubble on a structure and the structure does n't collapse .
Rubble cannot crush down any structure .
Now you have learnt a little what can happen when you drop anything on something and try to compress something .
Contact forces develop temporarily and the velocity of the striking object changes !
This basic knowledge is used in this paper .
And then you have to work from there .
Do the analysis step by step !
In A ) a vertical drop , gravity is always at work and produces forces acting on the various parts in contact and you have to include that , in B ) a horizontal collision , the propulsion force of the ship may still be active and you have to consider that .
When two bodies C and A of similar steel or any 3 - D structure , isotropic or composite , but different size collide , both bodies C and A are evidently deformed due to contact forces at the common , contact , interface / damages area .
Sometimes the bodies only bounce , sometimes they damage locally one another .
Stronger structural elements in composite structures will affect weaker elements in both bodies , i.e. the weaker steel elements fail before the stronger ones .
No rubble of steel elements is generally produced , when failures occur , as all elements , even broken ones , are still connected to other elements .
Only rubble is damaged loose furniture and similar inside the steel structure and it is of no importance .
6 . What is a drop ?
If the upper , 53 meters tall , 13 - 15 storeys upper part of WTC 1 above floor 97 actually dropped on the structure below is a matter of semantics .
Drop suggests that it was not being held at all .
I prefer that it came into contact after local structural failures and downward displacement and that it was prevented from dropping by the connecting elements between the two parts .
Only the velocity at contact is of interest and it was not high in the WTC 1 case .
Assuming a ' drop ' of 3.7 metres , it does not produce a big velocity ; it is around 8 m/s .
If the ' drop ' is dampened by intermediate connections the velocity is much less .
Assuming in A ) above ( WTC 1 upper part drops on the lower structure with perfect alignment columns / columns ) that the two parts act as springs ( disregarding local failures ) , the upper part would just bounce as described in one of my other articles .
No global one - way collapse would ensue !
This article is a follow - up of this conclusion .
In B ) above ( ships colliding or running aground like M/ T Exxon Valdez ) the contact velocity may be up to 10 m/s and the masses up to 200 000 tons , so it should be clear that in B ) 8 times bigger momentums and 10 times more energies may be involved compared with A ) .
Fig. A7 - A structure consists of elements and , if you remove one element at bottom , the elements above are affected , one after the other ... from bottom up !
It means that the structure fails - collapses - from bottom up .
The reverse , from top down , is not possible !
More info is available in booklet Best Practices for Reducing the Potential for Progressive Collapse in Buildings .
In order for an upper part of WTC 1 above floor 97 to drop on the structure below you must evidently remove all the supports below ; in the WTC 1 case 47 core columns and four perimeter wall assemblies ( each abt. 60 columns ) .
What happens to the upper part of WTC 1 , if you remove only one column below is shown in figure left of a different but similar structure :
Evidently the structural elements in the upper part , relying on one column below for support , will sag down , if your remove the support below .
Reason is that the assembly of elements of the upper part above is not very strong .
Same will happen , if the sole column fails for any reason .
When the upper part of WTC 1 dropped on 911 , we are however told that all supporting columns suddenly failed (! ) and that all structural elements of the upper part above displaced downwards as one intact , rigid , solid unit !
And that this unit - the upper part - kept together !
It was rigid !
Solid !
It could not deform !
It acted as a hammer hitting a nail and produced one - way crushing of the structure ( nail ! ) below !
It has never happened before or after 911 .
No structure has ever been crushed down by a little , weak top part falling on the remainder structure before or after 911 .
7. Prof. Bazant and NIST explain something to support terrorism ;
One - way crushing !
According Prof Bazant & al . [ 2 ] the following happens - one way crushing - when an upper part C , with initial constant (! ) height z 0 , of WTC 1 , with total height H , above say floor # 97 , falls on the similar structure , bottom part A , below floor # 97 and crushes floors # # 97 - 0 , part A , into rubble , part B :
The gravity - driven progressive collapse of a tower consists of two phases the Crush - Down , followed by Crush - Up ( Fig. 2 bottom ) , each of which is governed by a different differential equation ( Bazant and Verdure 2007 , pp. 312-313 ) .
During the Crush - Down , the falling upper part C of tower ( C in Fig. 2 bottom ( fig. 1 right ) ) , having a compacted layer of debris at its bottom ( zone B ) , is crushing the lower part ( zone A ) with negligible damage to itself .
During the Crush - Up , the moving upper part C of tower is being crushed at bottom by the compacted debris B resting on the ground .
Fig. 1 - Figure 2 bottom from [ 2 ]
Or - first upper part C one - way Crushes - Down bottom part A top into a thin layer of debris B with thickness l s 0 and then the complete bottom part A into a thick layer of compacted debris B with thickness l ( H - z 0 ) and then the thick layer of compacted debris B Crushes - Up upper part C bottom into a thin layer of debris B ' with thickness r= l r 0 and then the complete upper part C into a thick layer of debris B ' with thickness l z 0 and then there is only a tick layer of debris B+B ' with thickness l H left of bottom part A and upper part C. l is the compaction ratio !
Very nasty Greek letter !
Apply it to any structure and l will compact it .
First down , then up .
And then there is nothing left but rubble !
It is very simple according Bazant [ 5} :
" When the upper floor crashes into the lower one , with a layer of rubble between them , the initial height h of the story ( below ) is reduced to l h , with l denoting the compaction ratio ( in finite - strain theory , l is called the stretch ) .
After that , the load can increase without bounds . "
Nothing happens to the upper floor element or any other structural elements in upper part C !
Its height z 0 is constant during the complete Crush - Down Phase !
This is evidently impossible as we know from above that when two parts of identical structures come into contact in an impact , both parts are affected .
One small part , e.g. weak upper part C cannot transform a bigger part , e.g. stronger bottom part A , into dust , smoke and rubble ... and remain intact !
Bottom part A is stronger than weak upper part C .
Fig. 1 - Figure 2 bottom from [ 2 ]
And :
Since the initial Crush - Up phase terminates at very small axial deformation , it must be concluded that the simplifying hypothesis of one - way crushing is perfectly justified and causes only an imperceptible difference in results .
This new phenomenon one - way crushing of a 3 - D structure has never taken place before and after 9/11 as it is physically impossible !
Note no mention of forces !
So how could one - way crushing of a 3 - D structure suddenly occur on 9/11 ?
Check again photos above !
Answer is that one - way crushing of any structure from top down is not possible under any circumstances .
What is seen on videos and photos of the 911 WTC destructions is all faked !
It is simulations type Hollywood , Dreamworks & Disney .
And Bazant &
Co fake it by assuming that big bottom part A is weaker than small top part C .
In reality A is 100 times stronger than C ( as A carries C before ) and C can never crush A . C will always bounce on and remain on top of A that remains intact !
NIST has slightly different description of the one - way crushing down of part A by upper part C! From NIST report - NIST NCSTAR 1 - 6D chapter 5.2 :
" The aircraft impacted the north wall of WTC 1 at 8:46 a.m. between Floor 93 and Floor 98 .
The subsequent fires weakened structural subsystems , including the core columns , floors and exterior walls .
The core displaced downward At 100 min ( at 10:28:18 ) , the north , east , and west walls at Floor 98 carried 7 percent , 35 percent and 30 percent more gravity load loads and the south wall and the core carried about 7 percent and 20 percent less loads , respectively . , At 10.28 a.m. , 102 min after the aircraft impact , WTC1 began to collapse .
The release of potential energy ( PE ) due to downward movement of the building mass above the buckled columns exceeded the strain energy ( SE ) that could be absorbed by the structure .
Global collapse ensued . "
However - repeat - when two bodies C and A of identical or similar steel or any 3 - D structure but different size collide , both bodies are evidently deformed due to forces and energy applied at the common contact , interface area .
Sometimes they only bounce , sometimes they damage locally one another .
Stronger structural elements will affect weaker structural elements in both bodies , i.e. the weaker steel elements fail before the stronger ones .
The upper part can only apply forces / energy limited to its own strength and then it will break up .
No one - way crushing can take place !
No rubble of steel elements is generally produced , when failures occur , as all elements , even broken ones , are still connected to other elements .
Only rubble is damaged furniture and similar inside the steel structure and it is of no importance .
A smaller upper part C of a structure cannot crush down a bigger part A of the same structure assisted only by gravity .
No global collapse can ensue for that reason !
8 . Just watch the videos ( they are all fakes ) of the destruction and the rubble on the ground
The global collapse ( sic ! ) or one - way crushing that ensued at WTC 1 can be seen here !
Or just the start of it , the collision of the upper part C with the lower structure here as also shown below on two snap shots - fig .
2 . All videos / pictures are fake animations !
You can slide the video fwd / aft and see how the upper part C is first turned into dust and smoke , while everything below remains intact as shown below - there is no impact or collision :
Fig. 2 - Upper part C is destroyed !
Note - the pictures are fakes !
The upper part C of WTC 1 is above the yellow lines applied on the photos ( from Internet - reliability not guaranteed ) of the WTC 1 tower at say floor 95 and the lower structure is below .
Snap shot left above ( fig. 2 ) is just before destruction of upper part C starts and snap shot right a few seconds later .
It should be clear to anybody that the upper part C above the yellow lines simply disappears in the smoke and dust , while nothing has happened to the lower structure of WTC 1 .
The aircraft impact point in the North Tower was between the 95th ( yellow lines ) and 96th floors with the aircraft nosed down at 10 degrees , but the North Tower collapse initiates 30 feet above at the 98th floor , where there was very little aircraft impact damage .
The first floors to collapse afterward are the 99th through the 102nd , which in addition to having no aircraft impact damage had little fire if any .
In other words intact structure above the aircraft impact zone and main fire affected areas is actually collapsing first .
These observations alone should make it clear that the building was demolished and that the aircraft impacts were a cover for the demolitions to allow the collapses to be blamed on outsiders .
Evidently gravity alone cannot destroy , shorten , the upper part C before it , the upper part C is supposed to impact and collide with and crush down WTC 1 below !
Why is there so much smoke , debris and vertical deformation of the upper part C only ?
It , the upper part C , is simply destroyed by some energetic material devices and there is no collision with the lower part .
Same devices are apparently used to destroy the lower structure of WTC 1 a few seconds later .
In the official accounts of the destruction of WTC 1 the upper part C is supposed to remain intact - its height z 0 is assumed constant - and produce one - way crushing until the end of destruction and be crushed against the ground .
9 . Rigid blocks , boxes or sponges
NIST speaks of the core of WTC 1 as consisting of three sections - NIST NCSTAR 1 , p. 79 :
" At this point , the core of WTC 1 could be imagined (! ) to be in three sections .
There was a bottom section below the impact floors ( i.e. below floor 93 ) that could be thought of as a strong , rigid box , structurally undamaged and at almost normal temperatures .
There was a top section ( the upper part C above floor 97 ) above the impact and fire floors that was also a heavy , rigid box .
In the middle was the third section , partially damaged by the aircraft and weakened by heat from the fires . "
The section of the building above the damage zone , the upper part C , NIST calls a " rigid box . "
This rigid box first manifests its independent movement , when it tilts to the south - NIST NCSTAR 1 , p. 201 : " The section of the building above the impact zone ( near the 96th floor ) , acting as a rigid block , tilted " .
Do you see that on photos above ?
NIST also refers to this rigid block or box with terms such as " upper section " , " building section above the impact zone " , " building mass " , " upper building section " and " structural block . "
- NIST NCSTAR 1 , pp. 83 , 195 , 196 , 201 .
However , you have to treat the upper part C structure / stiffness in 3 - D and then it becomes very springy - like a sponge ; light structure of elastic material full of holes .
It is quite difficult to destroy a sponge dropping another sponge on it .
The other sponge bounces .
NIST acknowledges that this rigid block or box , upper part C , then falls .
NIST says that " the building section began to fall downward " , " the building section began to fall vertically " .
Do you see that on photos above ?
It is suggested that this falling rigid block goes through all or part of the damaged area or initiation zone " essentially in free fall " :
" Since the stories below the level of collapse initiation provided little resistance (! ) to the tremendous (! ) energy released by the falling building mass , the building section above came down essentially in free fall , as seen in videos " - NIST NCSTAR 1 - 6 , pp. 416 , 238 ; NIST NCSTAR 1 , p. 196 .
Do you see that on photos above ?
And seen in videos ?
Where ?
None of above is seen anywhere !
After falling through all or part of the damaged area of WTC 1 , the rigid block or falling building mass - the upper part C - encounters " intact structure " .
And , no surprise : " The potential energy released by the downward movement of the large building mass far exceeded (! ) the capacity of the intact structure below to absorb that through energy of deformation . "
- NIST NCSTAR 1 , p. 196 .
This is very strange !
The intact structure was previously described as a rigid box !
And there is no evidence for the suggestion !
Energy of deformation is the same as strain energy !
10 .
What is strain energy and can you calculate it ?
Strain energy ( SE ) is simply speaking a measure of the strength of the elements of the structure that holds it together and can resist deformation and damage .
Apply outside energy ( force times displacement ) on the structure that exceeds the strain energy that can be absorbed and the structure deforms or an element fails locally .
If it fails , it fails in the highest stressed area only and the structure changes !
Evidently the strain energy of the structure at every floor above , the upper part C , and in the structure below the initiation zone was about the same .
However , in all official explanations of the collapses it is assumed that the upper part C is rigid with height z 0 is constant and infinite strain energy from start and therefore will not deform and will absorb no amounts of extra strain energy at all !
All free energy ( or forces ! ) at impact is therefore assumed being directed down (? ) into the lower non-rigid structure by NIST and its supporting experts .
No forces are directed upwards !
The upper part C is however not rigid and can only absorb very limited strain energy during a crush down prior it self - destructs to forces acting on it and the destruction is arrested .
To assume the opposite in various papers described below and indirectly by NIST is simply to mislead the public .
The upper part C has a very limited capability to absorb strain energy - it will get destroyed - and that is the main reason why it cannot crush down the structure below and produce rubble .
On the contrary - the upper part C structure should be subject to serious structural failures at impact and absorb the energy released and arrest further destruction .
Not so difficult to grasp .
That 's why steel buildings of any type are not crushed down one - way by gravity acting on a loose top part due to local failures of some elements .
Every time you break an element of a structure , strain energy is consumed .
The amount of strain energy built into a structure thus depends on how many times you break the elements .
The amount of potential energy , PE , due to downward movement of the WTC 1 upper part C mass was definitely too small to destroy the lower structure in 100.000's of pieces and dust .
There is 1 000 times more strain energy , SE , built into the structure below than any gravity PE applied from above !
Calculations are given below and here .
Prof Bazant ( further described below ) and NIST suggest that the energy initiating or released at the WTC 1 destruction was enormous but in a serious ship collision it can be up to 10 times bigger and still the local failures are limited !!
NIST should learn from ship collisions !
Bazant , like NIST , also assumes that the WTC 1 upper part C was rigid ( ! ) .
Its height z 0 is constant !
A rigid object is indestructible and will destroy anything non-rigid .
But ships and WTC 1 upper part C structures are not rigid and break up at impact or collisions ( unless they just bounce ) due to local forces developing .
The structural damage analysis are quite similar for A ) and B ) .
Very few mechanical , civil or building engineers have studied the subject ( 99.9 % concentrate on design of new , intact structures ) but there is nothing new about structural damage analysis [ 4 ] .
No need to write scientific papers about it , as it was a new event that had never happened before and needed explanation .
Structural damages ( ship collisions ) occur every day .
Steel structure tower collapses are much more rarer .
The Bazant papers described below are therefore very suspect .
Enjoy this article .
Comments are always welcome .
And thanks for comments already given .
Fig. 3 - North and West ( right ) walls of WTC 1 just prior destruction .
According basic structural analysis no failed parts of the upper part C can damage the solid columns below the initiation zone .
This is the beauty of steel structure design .
If a part fails and loads are displaced by gravity , only secondary , weaker parts may fail ( mostly floors ) as a consequence .
The intact primary structure below cannot fail !
11 . The official explanation(s ) - One - way crushing ( used by terrorists )
The official NIST explanation (s ) of the WTC 1 ( fig. 3 left ) global collapse ( sic - should be crushing ) is that the alleged release of potential energy ( PE ) , of the mass of an upper part C above all supporting columns after sudden , local deformation and buckling , due to downward , alleged near free fall movement in an initiation zone ( indicated by red ) and impact of a structure below , exceeds the strain energy ( SE ) that can be absorbed by the same columns below and above and that all this was due to gravity only .
It is suggested that the upper part C is rigid and remains intact during the complete one - way crush down of the WTC 1 structure below , i.e. the global collapse (! ) is not a collapse but a ' one way crush down ' .
The one - way crush down is suggested to take place as follows ( fig. 4 ) : WTC 1 is assumed to consist of three parts : Fig. 4 - Schematics of a crush down of WTC1 on 9/11 by rubble !
Part A - the lower structure ( yellow in the picture ) ( 97 stories before crush down ) ; it is a non -rigid structure !
Part C - the upper part ( 13 - 15 stories ) : it is assumed rigid during crush down - its height z 0 is constant - and is thus completely different from part A ( and that is the key to the NIST falsifications ! )
Part B - rubble that is formed of part A due to lack of strain energy , when rigid part C crushes the stories one after the other .
Part B consists of small pieces of what was upper part A - rubble !
Each storey is 3.6 meters tall with uniform density 0.255 and becomes a 0.9 meter thick layer of rubble with uniform density 1.025 , when crushed [ 2 ] .
At time t = 0 sec part C is alleged to drop on part A - one - way crush down or rubble production starts .
At , say , time t = 10 seconds about 60 stories have been crushed and there are still 37 stories remaining of part A . A 54 meters thick layer of rubble - part B - has been formed of what was 60 stories !
The upper part C remains intact on top .
At time t = 12 seconds part A is completely crushed and only a 87.3 meters thick - very tall !
- layer of rubble on the ground - part B - remains of part A .
The upper part C still remains on top .
At time t = 15 seconds nothing remains !
Part C has suddenly become non-rigid and has been destroyed in a one - way crush up and the rubble - part B - is spread out on the ground .
Fig. 5 - Schematics of local failures up top of WTC1 Evidently this crush down model and theory is complete nonsense , but it is the official explanation (s ) of the WTC 1 destruction on 9/11 !
A small , fairly weak upper part C , 95 % air , cannot possibly crush a big part A of similar structure only due to gravity and compress it into a 87.3 meters tall tower of rubble on the ground after 10 seconds !
If weak upper part C actually dropped , it would get locally damaged at its bottom and there would be some local damages to part A upper part .
The worst case is that weak upper part C is completely destroyed and part A is locally damaged at top .
Rubble part B would only be formed on top of part A and part C would be rubble .
And rubble cannot crush anything !
Fig. 5 . Anyone that has just dropped anything on something knows this .
Try then to crush this something !
You need a big force that displaces ( energy ) for that , which gravity alone cannot provide .
Only when NIST assumes that upper part C is rigid during one - way crush down and does not become rubble itself and suddenly becomes non-rigid during crush up , NIST can manage to get their fantasies together .
12 . What you would expect to happen
The following would happen , if the upper part C actually drops ; two of its thin but strong walls slide and drop outside and do not damage anything .
The other two thin but strong walls slide and fall inside the structure - part A - below and punch holes in or slices the thin , weak floors there locally .
No rubble is really formed .
The thin , weak floors of the
upper part
C are in turn locally punched or sliced by the part A strong walls / columns below and will soon be jammed inside the part A walls / columns below .
No walls or columns are dropping on other walls or columns producing an impact !
Do not believe that the
upper part
C is solid , rigid , strong or anything like that !
It is quite weak .
Local failures - weak floors punched and sliced - will be produced at contacts .
No crush down will ever start !
Local gravity failures above cannot destroy the steel columns of the intact structure below !
All the energy released by dropping upper part C and applying forces is absorbed by the deformations , failures and fractures of thin floors in the initiation zone and locally in the upper part C and top of lower structure part A and by friction between locally failed floor parts rubbing against each other after initiation and by any loose parts dropping down outside .
The crush down or local failures should be arrested inside the initiation zone !
13 . Controlled top - down demolition - big sheets of intact perimeter wall columns assemblies would be pushed out and drop to ground !
One way of demolishing a structure is to horizontally cut off vital connections of primary structure holding the structure together at the bottom , i.e. to reduce its strain energy in its strongest elements .
The structure above will then drop straight down due to gravity and be damaged .
It is called Controlled Demolition !
You can try the same thing starting from the top , cutting structure horizontally up top ! , but then you will create a fountain of rubble , when blowing broken structure sideways .
See figure 22 .
Gravity only failures without further assistance do not produce rubble .
Controlled demolition on the contrary produces plenty of rubble in the process of destruction .
To demolish WTC 1 with controlled demolition is very simple .
As 37.4 % of the total mass of the tower is carried by only 24 outer , albeit very strong , core columns of various thickness , it would appear that by cutting them at say 10 floors intervals , load transfers to the perimeter walls would break the walls and the tower would come down .
Big sheets of intact perimeter wall columns assemblies , 10 floors high , would then be pushed out and drop to ground !
You can see it on all videos of the destructions .
Access to these outer core columns appears very easy .
How to quickly cut a 25 mm plate at very low cost is explained here .
Similar devices can cut and burn steel columns .
14 . The major NIST Problem - Lack of evidence !
The major problems with the NIST cause - a one - way crush down from top to bottom - are that fires normally only cause visible , local structural failures , deformations , fractures and displacements of steel structure elements that are soon arrested , when any energy released is absorbed by intact structure above and below the contact points and local failures - no global collapse or rubble .
There is
(1 ) no evidence that the core structure displaced downward , as it could not be seen ,
( 2 ) no evidence of any simultaneously buckled visible , outside wall columns in the fire zone - no such damaged , buckled , columns have been retrieved from the rubble ;
( 3 ) no sign ( evidence ) of drop of the building mass above the buckled columns - the upper part C - at near free fall acceleration a certain height and time as a rigid , solid mass and associated release of potential energy , PE , and
( 4 ) no indication ( evidence ) of an impact ( the PE is now kinetic energy , KE ) between the rigid , upper part C and the non -rigid structure below at which perfect alignment is necessary , which would be seen as a bump / deceleration on any video .
These four conditions are according NIST required for the upper part C to commence destroying , crushing down , the structure below , but there is no evidence for them .
Evidence to the contrary will be produced below .
The upper part C is not really one part .
It is a steel structure and an assembly of elements ; columns and floors .
There is further
( 5 ) no calculations by NIST of the potential energy , PE , released and the strain energy , SE , or lack of it , of the structure below ( and above ! ) that could be absorbed proving it was less than the PE or KE transmitted to it by the upper part C permitting a gravity only driven global collapse / one - way crush down to progress or ensue ,
( 6 ) no mention or calculation of forces , deformations , fractures in and friction between locally and partly damaged floors and other elements that would absorb further energy after initiation ,
( 7 ) no explanation how the solid , intact columns below were overloaded by gravity only , what loads were actually applied on the columns after initiation and why the columns would rupture / fracture horizontally in 1 000's of pieces about 10 - 12 meters long ,
( 8 ) no explanation ( or evidence ) why the upper part C would remain intact at the ( 4 ) impact ( except that it is rigid , which it is not ) , and
( 9 ) no explanation why so much rubble ( broken , fractured elements ) , smoke and dust were produced .
Evidently the potential energy released is transmitted to both the upper part C structure and the structure below - always as walls / columns punching / slicing floors - a fact that NIST conveniently forgets or ignores or intentionally censors .
Actually 50 % of any energy released should be absorbed by the smaller upper part C floors at impact and following deformation and local structural failures .
15 . Evidence contradicting the NIST cause
All videos of the WTC 1 destruction show that the upper part C telescopes into or shortens itself or implodes for about 3 - 4 seconds ( like the bottom structure below floor 16 of WTC 7 10 hours later ) , while the steel columns of the structure below are still intact prior any invisible impact !
Gordon Ross has described this clearly 2007 .
The deformation of the upper part C can not be produced by gravity forces alone .
The upper part C is not very strong and you wonder how it can crush down anything - except itself - later ?
David Chandler explains clearly what happens in his video analysis 2009 .
It would appear ( fig. 6 ) that the WTC 1 roof line drops about 35 meters in 3.1 seconds at an average velocity of 11.3 m/s prior any destruction of structure below is initiated ( by an alleged impact ) .
The acceleration associated with such a drop of the upper part C is of the order 7.3 m/s² or 0.75 g , and this displacement of the roof line is not associated with any destruction of structure or floors below floor 93 !
The only conclusion is that the upper part C , undamaged by any real fire , is compressed / implodes vertically > 50 % during the 3.1 seconds ... and there is no impact !
This vertical compression is however not associated with any horizontal expansion of the structure of the upper part C , so how can it take place ?
At least 8 - 10 floors of the upper part C including the initiation zone seem to disappear prior any destruction of the structure below .
One explanation is that the columns between a fair number of floors inside the upper part C are locally destroyed or cut and displaced prior initiation of lower structure destruction .
The ejection of smoke from the upper part C prior any destruction of structure / floors below suggests that some form local destruction is taking place in the upper part C . Fig. 6 - from [ 2 ] by Bazant
It has been suggested that the local destruction of the
upper part C
starts on the 105th (! ) floor as seen on faked
videos
( reliability thus not guaranteed ) of the South wall of the North Tower / WTC1 - sudden fire , where there was no fire before , and some wall columns buckling .
Fig. 7 A - WTC 1 North wall just before upper part C roof line starts to drop .
Note intact steel columns below the upper part C bottom floor # 97 .
No collapse or crush down of structure below has yet started there due to lack of strain energy ... and it will not take place !
As soon as upper part C drops , rubble should be produced below it !
Fig. 7 B - WTC 1 when upper part C roof line has dropped abt 15 meters after about 2 seconds of roof line dropping .
Total 5 - 6 floors ( floors # 97-92/91 ) of Lower part A should have been crushed and replaced by a 5 meters thick rubble part B acording [ 2 ] .
But lower part A has not been crushed down 20 meters and no 5 meters rubble layer part B is visible .
Lower Part A still extends to the red line .
Fig. 7 C - WTC 1 when upper part C roof line has dropped abt 35 meters after about 3.1 seconds of roof line dropping .
Total almost 13 floors ( floors # 97 - 84 ) or 46.7 meters of Lower part A should have been crushed and replaced by an 11.7 meters thick rubble part B acording [ 2 ] .
Lower Part
A still however extends to the red line .
No collapse / crush down of lower part A below has started and there is no rubble part B !
Soon after the
upper part C
disappers completely in a cloud of smoke and
rubble
!
What a ridiculous animation .
A big , 7 floors tall
piece of the West wall
with 25 wall columns and seven spandrels between floors , say #99 - 106 , i.e. 25 x 25 meters , weight more than 100 tons , is seen to be ejected outwards at high speed in the fountain of
rubble
.
It leads the
rubble
, i.e. is the first part of the
upper part C
to be detached .
Evidently such destruction cannot take place by gravity and an intact (!)
upper part C
crushing down .
It is animation type Hollywood !
Fig. 1 - Figure 2 bottom from [ 2 ]
According Bazant [ 2 ] upper part C shall be 100 % intact during these 3.1 seconds ( and later of course ) and produce an 11.7 meters rubble layer and destruction shall only take place below it and the rubble part .
No destruction can take place above the rubble part , where upper part C shall remain intact !
What we are really seeing on above three pictures ( fig. 7 A , B and C ) is local destruction of both parts A and C and not a one - way crush down of part A by an intact part C producing rubble .
In above picture right ( fig. 7 C ) it is obvious that the upper part C is being destroyed just after initiation of destruction and that there is no rubble below .
No smoke and debris shall be expelled from an undamaged upper part C structure .
There are 1 000's of photos of the crush down that follows but unfortunately some are missing , e.g. those during the 0.8 - 0.9 seconds , when the alleged indestructible upper part C supposedly near free falls 3.7 meters - all columns fail there and disappear at one storey - and then collides / impacts with the structure below transmitting the total upper block KE .
Actually no such photos exist as no free fall or impact took place !
And no intact upper part C is seen during the crush down destruction of the structure below that follows .
The upper part C was simply destroyed prior to any impact .
The upper part C of WTC 1 is a problem for NIST .
Its weight was not massive , only about 33 000 tons and the uniform density was < 0.18 !
It consisted of 95 % air .
The load bearing columns - the primary structure carrying this weight - occupied only 0.13 % of the total foot print or floor area in the initiation zone - the rest was air , floors and furniture , which is an indication how strong the lower steel structure columns were !
The compressive static forces and associated stresses in the steel columns were low ; < 32 % of the yield stress , i.e. a Factor of Safety , FoS , of elements against yield more than 3 .
And the built in strain energy , strength , to keep the upper part C together was exactly the same as for the structure below .
16 .
What is a one - way crush down ?
Ever heard about one ?
The American professor Z P Bazant , already mentioned above , published ( 13 September 2001 ) soon ( 2 days only ! ) after the WTC destructions an early explanation of his ostensible and passionate theory [ 1 ] that was adopted by the authorities , FEMA and NIST , as true .
Bazant suggested that there were five stages until the doom / one - way total crush down of a structure as illustrated in Fig. 8 .
Stage 1 : The fire causes the steel of the columns to be exposed to sustained temperatures apparently exceeding 800° C in an initiation zone ( 500° C according NIST - and in only a few columns at a time ) .
Stage 2 : At such temperatures , structural steel suffers a decrease of yield strength and loses its load carrying capacity !
( Actually the load carrying capacity is reduced abt 20 % at 500 °C and with a Factor of Safety > 3 no serious decrease of load carrying capacity should happen ) .
Stage 3 ( One - way crush down starts ) :
Once more than half of the columns in the critical floor ( floors 94 - 95 of WTC1 ) that is heated most suffer buckling so the upper part starts falling down onto the structure below the critical floor ( floor 93 ) .
At that moment , the upper part has acquired an enormous kinetic energy , KE , ( only 1.2 GJ corresponding to 41 kgs of jet fuel - if it actually happened ) and a significant downward velocity ( less than 9 m/s ) !
Fig. 8 - Figure 1 from [ 1 ]
Stage 4 ( First one - way crush ) :
The vertical impact of the mass of the upper part onto the structure below applies enormous vertical dynamic load on the underlying structure below , far exceeding its load capacity , even though it is not heated .
( Actually 50 % of the energy ( the dynamic load ) is transmitted to the upper part , if an impact and visible deceleration of the upper part would have taken place , and the upper part would have been destroyed very quickly ; compare the rubber ball bouncing on a floor described above ) .
Stage 5 ( Compression and more one - way crushing ) :
This causes failure of an underlying multi-floor segment of the tower , in which the failure of the connections of the floor - carrying trusses to the columns is either accompanied or quickly followed by buckling of the core columns and overall buckling of the wall columns !
( Not proven , of course .
The upper part should simply bounce on the lower structure , while there are some local failures .
Just buckling one column requires ; first to deform it elastically vertically and sideways , then to produce three plastic hinges in the column , then to produce fractures in the hinges that must cut through the column ; as soon as one fracture cuts off the column , there is no longer any contact and the top part slides off the lower part , etc ) .
Stage 6 ( One - way crush down ) :
The part of building lying beneath , i.e. the structure below , is then impacted again by an even larger mass falling with a greater velocity and the series of impacts and failures then proceeds all the way down .
( This is impossible !
Each column has now been cut off by one fracture at one plastic hinge and the upper part of a column can no longer impact a lower column .
It will therefore contact something else - a floor ! - and cause local failure there or just slide against other structure .
Friction between loose parts absorbing energy should now start ) .
This Stage 6 is the famous ' one - way crush down ' of a 3 - D steel structure that nobody in serious structural engineering circles had ever heard of before 911 , when it was invented by Bazant .
Or after !
Compare with the global collapse ( sic ! ) that ensued that can be seen here !
In [ 5 ]
Bazant ( 2007 ) points out errors in his previous paper and develops some new ideas about Stage 6 :
" The kinetic energy of the top part of the tower impacting ( sic - highlight by AB ) the floor below was found to be about 8.4X larger than the plastic energy absorption capability of the underlying storey , and considerably higher than that if fracturing were taken into account .
This fact , along with the fact that during the progressive collapse of underlying stories the loss of gravitational potential per story is much greater than the energy dissipated per story , was sufficient for Bazant and Zhou to conclude , purely on energy grounds , that the tower was doomed once the top part of the tower dropped through the height of one story or even 0.5 m .
It was also observed that this conclusion made any calculations of the dynamics of progressive collapse after the first single - story drop of upper part superfluous . "
and
" When the upper floor crashes into the lower one , with a layer of rubble between them , the initial height h of the story is reduced to l h , with l denoting the compaction ratio ( in finite - strain theory , l is called the stretch ) .
After that , the load can increase without bounds . "
Does really the kinetic energy of the upper part C after a drop of only 0.5 m exceed the plastic energy absorption capability of the underlying storey and by a factor of 8.4 , if the drop is 3.6 m , and is it relevant ?
Well , the upper part C is 53 meters tall and an underlying storey is only 3.6 meters tall and if you assume that the upper part C is like a solid hammer head and the underlying storey is a nail , then the hammer head will deform the nail .
But no rubble will be produced .
The hammer head , the upper part C will then slip off .
Bazant assumes it hits again .
To produce rubble you must hammer several times , repeatedly .
If , one the other hand you assume that the nail consists of 97 storeys , i.e. consider the whole structure below , then the underlying structure can elastically absorb 97 times more energy than just one storey and then the upper part will just bounce on the lower structure .
The kinetic energy of the upper part C is just 0.086 of the plastic absorption capability of the total structure .
And let 's face it - the upper part C is not a solid like a hammer head !
It is as flexible as the lower structure and will absorb 50 % of the energy applied at alleged impact .
The kinetic energy of the upper part C was too small to do any real harm or initiate a crush down .
The only result will be lots of local failures up top .
The upper part C of the tower cannot really impact the floor below , because , before that would happen , the intermediate columns ends damage locally both the floor above in the upper part C and the floor below ( the underlying storey ) and the interface changes .
No rubble is really created except crushed furniture and lightweight walls ( gypsum boards ) as the space between the top part and the underlying floor is 95 % air - the columns occupying 0.13 % of the volume .
17 . Upper part C is destroyed by forces acting on it
It is furthermore not the total kinetic energy of the upper part C that is applied to the underlying storey - only the forces applied by upper part C columns are locally damaging , fracturing the underlying floor .
At the same time the columns below apply forces on and start to destroy the upper part C bottom floor in the same manner .
To fracture , punch through or slice a floor requires energy .
Locally damaged floors would then get entangled into one another , huge friction forces would develop and arrest further destruction .
No impact !
To suggest that the load can increase without bounds due to a layer of rubble is nonsense .
Bazant ignores local damages to the floors , all fractures that develop and the huge friction between these locally failed floors as the main factors arresting structural destruction .
The loads and forces are actually reduced , mostly by friction !
And collapse arrest should soon follow !
18 . Obvious contradictions
Regardless - Bazant 100 % contradicts what NIST says about the system that supports the upper part C ( repeat from above ) :
" The subsequent fires weakened structural subsystems , including the core columns , floors and exterior walls .
The core displaced downward At 100 min ( at 10:28:18 ) , the north , east , and west walls at Floor 98 carried 7 percent , 35 percent and 30 percent more gravity load loads and the south wall and the core carried about 7 percent and 20 percent less loads , respectively . , . " ( NIST report - NIST NCSTAR 1 - 6D chapter 5.2 ) .
Imagine an upper part C supported by a core and four walls and that the core below it ( not seen of course ) displaces downwards !
Then the core cannot support anything above , unless the upper part C starts to deform , but why should it ?
It is undamaged .
So , if the core displaced downwards as suggested by NIST , the core would then carry 100 % (! ) less load , i.e. nothing at all ; actually the core must have been disconnected from the upper part C and the load on the core should be transmitted to the walls .
Furthermore , Bazant assumes in [ 1 ] that the lower structure can be regarded as a spring ( while the upper part C is rigid and not a spring at all ! ) and wonders what its spring constant C can be :
" According to this hypothesis , one may estimate that C =71 GN / m ( due to unavailability of precise data , an approximate design of column cross sections had to be carried out for this purpose ) " .
This results in an extremely stiff spring that does not really compress at all as a spring ( more like a solid rod ) and is easily locally overloaded , i.e. breaks in one point ( at the top ) but does not globally collapse .
But if a big force , or 4 F in figure below , would suddenly be applied to the top of a lower tower structure with flexible vertical columns supported by horizontal floors pin joint to the columns by an upper part from above ( let 's forget that the core has already displaced downwards ) , you would expect the whole lower tower structure to deform as shown below in fig .
9 , i.e. bulge in / out between floors , before any failures occur !
Simple Finite Element Analysis , FEA , or rather beam analysis shows this .
The forces are evidently balanced by reaction forces at ground supports and the energy E applied to the structure , now stored as elastic compression d , is simply E = 4 F d .
Fig. 9 - Elastic , vertical deformation of of steel beam tower
19 .
The WTC # 1 and 2 towers were flexible
The WTC towers were in fact very flexible .
Apply a very strong wind load sideways and the roof may deflect transversely 2 - 3 meters relative the ground .
Assuming that a plane suddenly impacted horizontally at floors 95 - 96 , the whole WTC 1 tower must have been displaced sideways ( south ) at least 1 meter or more there and then have been swinging back to vertical and 1 meter or more in the opposite ( north ) direction in say 10 seconds and more at roof level ( not seen on any film of the collision ) .
The mast on top must have been swaying a lot .
People in the top floors should have been thrown into walls and furniture or on the floor due such a big , sudden impact from the side .
Wind loads are less sudden but must have been felt earlier in the history of the building .
Wave impacts on ships are described here .
WTC 2 was impacted lower down and would only displace sideways ( north ) 0.5 meter at floor 77 , then back to vertical and 0.5 meter backwards ( south ) but more higher up .
Total displacement between extremes is > 1 meter , which should be seen on any video , e.g. the Scott Meyers video of the west and east walls ( distance between wall columns is 1 meter and maybe you will see them swaying ?
The author could not ! )
The tower would be oscillating for one or two minutes after impact and NIST has apparently analysed that .
So much for transverse flexibility .
Regarding the lateral impact - e.g. an aluminium wing structure , the ax , chopping through a steel box wall column , the log - the pressure between aluminium and steel parts and energy applied at a very small contact area at high velocity ( >200 m /s ) must have been extreme causing high temperatures virtually melting the metal instead of fracturing it .
The chop must have taken < 0.002 seconds !
The wing is then destroyed and cannot chop , e.g. internal steel core columns !
However , the vertical impact later , upper part C dropping by gravity on part A , should have taken place at much lower velocity allowing the structures to deform .
A realistic value for WTC 1 as a vertical spring - vertical flexibility - being suddenly loaded from above is C = 0.5 - 1.0 GN / m at top and little more further down , the lower structure is also quite flexible , and then the upper part C should just bounce [ 6 ] on the lower structure at hypothetical impact disregarding local failures at contact points .
You should in fact be able to see a big compression of the lower part A , if the upper part C actually impacted and then local failures would follow .
You wonder why Bazant estimates spring constants 140 times bigger than a realistic one and that the upper part C remains intact and no elastic deformation of the lower part .
To prove global collapse ?
His whole theory seems to be based on this estimate .
However , David B. Benson , co-author of [ 2 ] with Bazant has 27 January 2009 explained to the this author :
" That result applies , strictly speaking , only to a one - dimensional homogenous crush down .
Since the top portion was tilted and the sturcture (! ) was not homogeneous , no damage to the top portion is only an approximation to reality . "
The WTC1 destruction is evidently not a one - dimensional homogeneous one - way crush down of a homogenous rod and approximations should be avoided .
David B. Benson has also informed he has seen no videos and pictures of WTC 1 !!
His PC is too slow !
If any column would fail and not produce a bounce before that - Stage 2 in the Bazant theory - you would expect the following to happen to it in 3 - D , when a compressive load is applied :
A. .............................................................. ;;; B. ;; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ;;;;; C. D. ............................... ;;;;;........................ E. Fig. 10 - Five steps of buckling of a column due to vertical , compressive load
First , A , a plastic hinge develops in the middle of the compressed column due to lack of strain energy there , then , B , two more plastic hinges develop above and below the first hinge , then , C and D , the column ' kneels ' and finally , E , a severely deformed part of the column may punch a hole in the floor below it .
The column will never fracture in any location and it will never rupture due to fractures at the hinges into several pieces , i.e. it will always be connected , albeit very deformed .
To suggest that ' buckling ' of a column will result in free fall of the load it carries is not correct !
The above deformation takes time and would be seen on any video , if it took place !
Thus , Stage 3 , of Bazant in not possible !
It is an invention !
20 . Strange explanations and real verifications
More strange explanations / inventions were given by Bazant ( 2008 ) in [ 2 ] with Frank Greening and David B. Benson joining .
In [ 2 ]
WTC 1 is split into three parts during destruction ; part A - lower structure to be crushed , part B - a layer of rubble being formed by a part C - the upper part - that remains intact and drives the destruction .
21 . Mass and density of upper part C
Near the top , the linear , 1 - D , specific mass ( of WTC 1 ) ( mass per unit height ) µ = 1 020 000 kg /m or 1 020 ton / m according [ 2 ] .
In [ 2 ] the problem is only in 1 - D ; one dimension !
A line with point masses that is being shortened !
With a storey height 3.6 m , the mass of a storey - or the line representing the storey - is 3 672 ton .
Assuming the upper part C is 53 m high ( 14.7 storeys ) , total mass of upper part C is 54 .
060 tons .
In article the author suggests 33 000 tons , but the difference is of no importance .
Using a floor area of 4 000 m² of the line - to make the model 3 - D - the volume of upper part C is 212 000 m3 , thus the uniform ( which it is not ) density of the upper part C is 0.255 ton/m3 or 255 kg/m3 according [ 2 ] .
It is not very much !
Reason is that there is plenty of air inside a storey 3 - D structure .
This clearly shows how Bazant &
Co confuse the issue : they treat the three parts A , B and C in 1 - D as lines !
22 . Density of rubble - part B
The known typical (! ) linear , 1 - D , density (! ) of rubble , µ c = 4 100 000 kg / m or 4 100 ton / m according [ 2 ] .
The density of this rubble is then exactly 1 025 kg/m3 ( as the floor area is 4 000 m² ) , which is the density of salt water ( that ships float in ) .
Imagine a line of salt water !
Fig. 4 - Schematics of a crush down of WTC1 on 9/11 by rubble !
Thus , when one storey is homogeneously crushed , it becomes 0.896 m high .
As it was originally 3.6 m high it has been compressed 75.1 % .
What type of line can be shorthened 75.1 % ?
In real collisions between similar structures no part B - rubble - is ever formed !
Only parts A and C are locally damaged at the contact area !
Bazant &
Co just invent part B to hide this fact !
23 . Initiation of collapse - the first crush - formation of rubble part B
Thus at initiation  upper part C  54 060 tons  crushes the uppermost floor - say it is floor no .
96 - of part A , the lower structure of WTC 1 , and compresses it into a 0.9 m thick layer of debris that becomes part B .
This layer is resting on the second uppermost floor of part A . This compression takes place at increasing velocity .
Only air / smoke is ejected sideways out between floors 96/95 .
The mass of the rubble - 3 670 tons - is uniformly distributed on the floor no .
95 below - 918 kg/ m² - and this floor no .
95 floor should be able to carry that load according NIST FAQ .
Note that part C only compresses the storey floors 96/95 into a rubble layer - part B .
It does not accelerate the rubble layer / part B .
No solid parts are ejected sideways .
The compression should be associated with a noticable deceleration of upper part C. Not seen of course .
What about the upper part C and its 54 060 tons ?
Is it acting on the rubble layer part B ?
Not really - upper part C is intact and only its bottom thin floor , floor no .
97 , is in contact with rubble part B .
The columns of upper part C are now not in contact with the columns of part A below due to this layer of rubble , but let 's assume that upper part C columns crushes the columns below as suggested in [ 2 ] , so that destruction can continue !
In a real collision upper part C should be damaged at the contact area !
Bazant &
Co just invent part B to hide this fact !
The roof line has then dropped 2.704 m!
Air / smoke should be ejected from floor no .
97 .
24 .
The second crush - rubble part B doubles in thickness - energy calculations
Then the upper part C + part B ( the layer of rubble ) crushes the second uppermost floor of part A .
This event can hardly be associated with a second impact by part C as it had just compressed floors 96/95 .
Regardless , now storey floors 95/94 is compressed into another 0.9 m thick layer of rubble that is added to part B . Part B rubble is thus 1.8 m high / thick after two floors of part A have been crushed .
If a typical storey of part A is 3.6 m tall , it then becomes a 0.9 m thick layer or rubble at crush down .
This layer has a mass of 3.67 × 106 kg ( or 3 670 tons ) and uniform density 1 025 kg /m3 .
It is suggested that the first crush down can be initiated by a 0.5 m drop of upper part C , thus the initial potential energy , PE 0 , applied is 0.5 x 54.06 × 106 x 9.82 = 265.44 × 106 J .
Then upper part C drops another 3.6 m and compresses one storey into 0.9 m of rubble , thus more potential energy , PE 1 , is applied ; 3.6 x 54.06 × 106 x 9.82 = 1 911.13 × 106 J .
Total energy E applied is PE 0 + PE 1 = 2 176.57 x 106 J or simply 2.18 GJ to crush down the top storey of part A .
Bazant & Co suggest [ 2 ] that
 the total energy dissipation per unit height , which represents the resisting force F c , consists not only of energy F b dissipated by the inelastic hinges formed during column buckling , but also of energy F s required for comminuting concrete floor slabs , energy F a required for expelling air from the tower , and energy F e required for ejecting particles and fragments  .
However , it seems Bazant & Co in their 1 - D model miss the friction force required to compress and accelerate the rubble .
Anyway  if total energy E = 2.18 GJ is used to buckle the columns , to comminute one floor , to expel air , eject particles and fragments and to compress the rubble into a 0.9 m layer , then  after this second crush and compression  part C and the rubble would have stopped .
2.18 GJ corresponds to about 606 kWh .
The total volume of rubble is after crushing one storey is 3 700 m3 with a mass of 3 760 tons .
The unit amount of energy to compress one ton of rubble is thus only 0.161 kWh / ton .
This may be compared with the amount of energy to shred a scrap steel stripped car that is about 36.8 kWh / ton in a very modern recycling factory , or 240 times more .
Crushing grapes into wine also requires a lot of energy , the author is being told .
It is realized that shredding a thin steel plate car cannot be compared with compressing a composite steel columns / concrete floor tower , but in the author 's the amount of energy to compress one storey into 3 670 tons of rubble seems very low .
The roof line has then dropped 5.4 m!
The velocity of the roof line apparently is increasing - but why ?
It should slow down by so much sudden compression .
More air / smoke should be ejected sideways from between floors 96/95 , i.e. only from the storey being crushed .
Can you see it on any video ?
Furthermore , [ 2 ] suggests that part C and the rubble do not stop after the first crushes .
On the contrary part C continues to accelerate and the rubble is also accelerated , while part A is being crushed again .
Thus we have to deduct the energy required to keep part C accelerating and to accelerate the static rubble to same speed as part C in above calculations to find the energy dissipated only to produce - part B - the rubble of crushing the first or second storey of part A .
To accelerate 3760 tons of rubble to 20 m/s requires about 209 kWh , to 30 m/s it is 470 kWh , etc .
If , say , upper part C is not stopped after crushing one storey but continues to accelerate at say 0.65 g and that part B - the rubble - should be brought up from speed 0 to the speed of upper part C , then maybe only 30 % of total energy E is available to buckle columns , comminute concrete , expel air , eject particles and fragments and compress the rubble , thus unit amount of energy to compress one ton of rubble becomes only 0.05 kWh / ton or 736 times less than shredding a car .
In the author 's opinion that is much too little to produce a crush down of any kind of 3 - D structure .
To crush one ton of grapes into wine requires more than 0.05 kWh .
Try !
It is a healthy exercise !
A more detailed energy balance is shown here when upper part C has dropped 31.38 meters .
The potential energy applied to ( lost in ) the process is upper part C moving down 31.38 meters and 41.84 meters of part A crushed down 15.69 meters ( 53 000 000 x 31.38 + 41 840 000 x 15.69 ) x 9.82 = 22.8 GJ , which means that only 22.8 - 20.4 = 2.4 GJ of energy is used to compress 41 840 000 kg of part A into rubble B or 2 400 000 000/41 840 000 = 57.4 J/kg or 57 kJ / ton or only 0.016 kWh / ton WTC 1 structure .
And so on !
25 .
The displacement of the roof line of part C during destruction of 13 storeys
According careful observations in [ 6 ] we know that the roof line of upper part C dropped 35 m in 3.17 seconds at increasing velocity .
We also know that upper part C roof line is accelerating at about 0.64 - 0.7g [ 6 ] !
This means that upper part C , or what remains of it , as it is shortened and disappears , can only apply a force of 0.3 g or 30 % of its own weight to crush floors of part A and build up the rubble layer - part B - ignoring the fact that it is upper part C that actually implodes .
Every time a storey is crushed , upper part C drops 2.70 m and an 0.9 m layer of rubble is formed according [ 2 ] and upper part C is remaining intact according Bazant & Co .
Thus , when the roof line has dropped 35 m , 12.94 storeys (!! ) , total height 46.6 m (! ) of part A should have been crushed , and should have been replaced by an 11.66 m thick layer of rubble  part B - with the upper part C still on top .
Writers of [ 6 ] believe that only 9 ( or 9.72 ) storeys have been crushed but according [ 2 ] it should be 12.94 storeys !
Writers of [ 6 ] forget that there should be an 11.66 m thick layer of rubble below the upper part C , when it has dropped 35 m after 3.17 seconds .
26 . Verification of parts A and B using video recordings of the destruction of 13 storeys
Fig. 11 - Upper Part C being destroyed - No rubble Part B being formed ( same as fig . 7 above )
Regardless  does anybody see ( fig. 11 ) an 11.56 m thick layer of compressed rubble  part B  on any ( fake ! ) video after a 35 m drop of the upper part of WTC 1 , part C according [ 2 ] ?
And that 46.6 m of part A - floors 96 - 85 - has been destroyed after 3.17 seconds ?
It would appear that at least floors 85 - 93 are still intact !
And does anybody believe that an upper part C with density 255 kgs / m3 can produce an 11.56 m thick layer of rubble during 3.17 seconds and at the same time accelerate at 0.64-0.7g ?
Only [ 2 ] suggests so , but it is just an invention to suit a false 1 - D mechanics model / theory of a one - way crush down .
This layer of rubble - part B - should then be moving at a velocity of > 20 m/s and increasing as acceleration seems to be rather constant 0.64-0.7g .
Only air should be ejected from the next storey below being crushed , where more rubble is formed .
But upper part C cannot possibly both compress and accelerate part B at the same time !
Ah , what funny model [ 2 ] invents !
Do n't they see that upper part C is destroyed ?
Fig .
12 - Debris being ejected > 100 meters in all directions .
Typical Hollywood style animation !
It can not take place in reality !
Fig. 12 left shows the upper part ( ?? ) of WTC 1 about 10 seconds after the roof line started to move .
Is it there ?
Is the upper part hidden by the fountain of debris ... if it is there ?
According [ 2 ] there should not be any debris 100 meters outside the tower at all - just a layer of compacted rubble - part B - on top of part A. Crush down !
With part C - the upper part riding on part B .
There should not be any debris 100 meters outside the bottom part A !
Video evidence - and this picture - on the other hand show that all parts A ( top ) , B ( does n't exist or is the rubble 100 meters outside the tower ! ) and C are exploding or have been destroyed and structural pieces of them are thrown out in all directions 100 meters .
You need 1 000 times more energy for that than gravity displacing the upper part downwards for that !
You really wonder if the authors of [ 2 ] have studied any ( fake ! ) videos or pictures of the WTC 1 destruction ?
27 . Situations when part C roof line has dropped 100 m , 200 m and when part B hits ground Now  when upper part C has dropped 100 m and 37 storeys have been crushed , the layer of rubble  part B  should be 33 m thick on top of which a 53 m high upper part C should still be visible ( forgetting the mast ) .
An when upper part C has dropped 200 m and 74 storeys have been crushed , the layer of rubble should be an impressive 66 m thick with part C still riding on top of it .
Imagine a layer of rubble - density 1.025 ton/m3 - 66 m high .
Over 4 000 m² floor area it is almost a big cube of 264 000 tons of rubble !!
On top of which upper part C - 54 060 tons float .
Part C is 53 m high !
Add the rubble - part B - and we have a moving mass of 318 060 tons that is 119 m high when the upper part C roof line has dropped 200 meters .
Below this 119 m high pile , a storey of part A - floor 23 - is just being crushed and air - not smoke - is ejected there .
How the columns of upper part C - 66 m above floor 23 can crush the columns 66 m below is not clear .
266 m of walls should also be gone .
There are another 23 storeys still to crush !
About 83 m of WTC1 remains to be crushed .
Fig. 4 - Schematics of a crush down of WTC1 on 9/11 by rubble !
Can it be seen on any video ?
83 m of part A + 66 m of part B (
rubble
) and 53 m of part C equal 202 m!
If the original tower was 402 m then the roof line should have dropped 200 m when 74 floors had been crushed .
Add the mast 40 m .
Seen on any video ?
Note also that
upper part
C is still accelerating at 0.7g at this time .
The speed is of the order 45 m/s !
It does n't make sense .
Reason is that parts B and C have disappeared at this time .
Part B never existed
.
And part A is being destroyed by something else !
When all 98 floors of WTC 1 - part A - have been crushed , there should be an 83 m thick layer of rubble on the ground + upper part C on top - 53 m .
This is also confirmed by [ 2 ] - see fig .
13 ( b ) right : just before the end of crush down the 53 m high part C rests on a 92 m thick layer of debris ( density 1.025 ton / m3 ) - the crush down has also penetrated the basement 22 m bel

It 's not exactly surprising that the Wii has had very little triple - A games released for it .
Three years ago , absolutely no - one in the industry expected the Wii to be a success , most predicting the exact opposite .
And seeing as it takes around three years to make a high end game , that 's a pretty good explanation why the Wii 's cupboard remains so bare .
Not that that makes it suck any less to be a Wii owner .

So what do I want ?
I mean , other than to bitch and complain that is .
Let 's start with : A decent first person shooter .
A racing game without blue shells .
A game where you can swing around a lightsaber and it is And what are the odds of getting those ?
Well , let me show you a couple charts .
The first one is for the sales across all systems for the latest Call of Duty game .

That thin wedge at the bottom represents the Wii's sales , a figure so small that I believe it 's dwarfed by the number of copies of the game eaten by raccoons during shipping .
If I was a third party developer I 'd look at this graph , and decide to never devote another cent to Wii development for anything that is n't a Dora the Explorer fishing game .
Hardcore gamers do n't buy games for the Wii .
Apparently I do n't exist .
On the other hand , the size of the Wii 's install base is well past the point where it can be safely ignored or disregarded .
Even if a sizable portion of the Wii's owners have no interest in playing anything besides the cow - riding game in Wii Play , that still leaves millions of Wii owners out there who do .
And that 's how crazy shit like this can happen :

Yes , that 's a Wii game outselling Halo 3 .
Sure Mario
Kart is a venerable franchise , and all games made by Nintendo sell well , but still .
A game on the Wii is outselling Halo .
So as for the likelihood of more " good " games coming out for the Wii in the future , I dunno - there 's factors either way .
I guess the reasonable thing to say is that " it ca n't get any worse than it is , " because currently the only thing my Wii is doing is keeping a couple DVD 's elevated an inch or so above whatever it is the Wii is resting on .
Enlarge SANTA CLARA , Calif .  Major U.S. banks sought government permission to bring thousands of foreign workers into the country for high - paying jobs even as the system was melting down last year and Americans were getting laid off , according to an Associated Press review of visa applications .
The dozen banks now receiving the biggest rescue packages , totaling more than $ 150 billion , requested visas for more than 21,800 foreign workers over the past six years for positions that included senior vice presidents , corporate lawyers , junior investment analysts and human resources specialists .
The average annual salary for those jobs was $ 90,721 , nearly twice the median income for all American households .
As the economic collapse worsened last year -- with huge numbers of bank employees laid off -- the numbers of visas sought by the dozen banks in AP 's analysis increased by nearly one - third , from 3,258 in the 2007 budget year to 4,163 in fiscal 2008 .
The AP reviewed visa applications the banks filed with the Labor Department under the H - 1B visa program , which allows temporary employment of foreign workers in specialized - skill and advanced - degree positions .
Such visas are most often associated with high - tech workers .
It is unclear how many foreign workers the banks actually hired ; the government does not release those details .
The actual number is likely a fraction of the 21,800 foreign workers the banks sought to hire because the government only grants 85,000 such visas each year among all U.S. employers .
During the last three months of 2008 , the largest banks that received taxpayer loans announced more than 100,000 layoffs .
The number of foreign workers included among those laid off is unknown .
Foreigners are attractive hires because companies have found ways to pay them less than American workers .
Companies are required to pay foreign workers a prevailing wage based on the job 's description .
But they can use the lower end of government wage scales even for highly skilled workers ; hire younger foreigners with lower salary demands ; and hire foreigners with higher levels of education or advanced degrees for jobs for which similarly educated American workers would be considered overqualified .
" The system provides you perfectly legal mechanisms to underpay the workers , " said John Miano of Summit , N.J. , a lawyer who has analyzed the wage data and started the Programmers Guild , an advocacy group that opposes the H - 1B system .
David Huber of Chicago is a computer networking engineer who has testified to Congress about losing out on a 2002 job with the former Bank One Corp .
He learned later the bank applied to hire dozens of foreign visa holders for work he said he was qualified to do .
" American citizenship is being undermined working in our own country , " Huber said in an AP interview .
Beyond seeking approval for visas from the government , banks that accepted federal bailout money also enlisted uncounted foreign workers , often in technology jobs , through intermediary companies known as " body shops . "
Such businesses are the top recipients of the H - 1B visas .
The use of visa workers by ailing banks angers Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa , the senior Republican on the Senate Finance Committee .
" In this time of very , very high unemployment ... and considering the help these banks are getting from the taxpayers , they 're playing the American taxpayer for a sucker , " Grassley said in a telephone interview with AP .
Grassley , with Sen. Richard Durbin , D - Ill. , is pushing for legislation to make employers recruit American workers first , along with other changes to the visa program .
Banks turned to foreign workers before the current economic crisis , said Diane Casey - Landry , chief operating officer for the American Bankers Association .
The group said a year ago that demand exceeded the pool of qualified workers in areas like sales , lending and bank administration .
Now with massive layoffs , the situation is different , Casey - Landry said .
The issue takes on a higher profile as the government injects billions of dollars into the economy and President Barack Obama pushes for massive government spending to create jobs nationwide , on top of the $ 700 billion already approved for the ailing banks .
" You 're using taxpayer dollars and there 's an expectation that there are benefits to the U.S. , " said Ron Hira , a national expert on foreign employment and assistant public policy professor at the Rochester Institute of Technology .
" What you 're really doing is leaking away those jobs and benefits that should accrue to the taxpayers . "
But New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg believes more access to " worldwide talent pools " will better position U.S. financial companies against global competitors , spokesman Andrew Brent said .
U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services declined to disclose details on foreign workers hired at the banks that have received federal bailouts .
The AP has requested the information under the U.S. Freedom of Information Act. Nearly all the banks the AP contacted also declined to comment on their foreign hiring practices .
Arlene C. Roberts , spokeswoman for State Street Corp. of Boston , which has received $ 2 billion in bailout money , said the company has reduced H - 1B hiring in recent years , and just hires for specialized positions .
Jennifer Scott of Yreka , Calif. , a retired technical systems manager at Bank of America in Concord , Calif. , said in 2004 she oversaw foreign employees from a contractor firm that also sent overnight work to employees in India .
" It had nothing to do with a shortage , but they did n't want to pay the U.S. rate , " she said , adding that the quality of the work was weak .
" It 's all about numbers crunching . " ___ Associated Press writer Frank Bass in East Dover , Vt. , contributed to this report .

The European Union is now the world 's biggest integrated economic area
The European Commission says the 27 - nation EU must not let the current economic crisis jeopardise the gains of eastward enlargement .
A commission report says the accession of 12 states since 2004 - mostly ex-Soviet bloc countries - boosted living standards and business opportunities .
It said enlargement served as an anchor for stability and driver of democracy .
But there are concerns that EU states may be tempted to prop up weak domestic firms at their neighbours ' expense .
The BBC's Chris Mason in Brussels says the impact of the economic crisis threatens to undermine the single market , a founding tenet of European integration .
' Peace and prosperity '
The European Union took in 10 mostly ex-communist countries in Central and Eastern Europe in 2004 and two more , Romania and Bulgaria , in 2007 .
It is now the world 's biggest integrated economic area , with half a billion people producing 30 % of global economic output and 17 % of world trade .
Enlargement has served as an anchor of stability , and driver of democracy and the rule of law in Europe
Olli Rehn
EU Enlargement Commissioner
EU enlargement :
The next seven
In the report on published on Friday , the commission said enlargement had brought about huge economic and political benefits for both sides .
Income per capita in new member states rose from 40 % of the old member states ' average in 1999 to 52 % in 2008 .
Economic growth averaged 5.5 % per year in 2004 - 2008 , compared to 3.5 % in 1999 - 2003 .
The old member states averaged annual growth of around 2.2 % in the last four years .
Enlargement also increased trade opportunities .
In 2007 , almost 80 % of exports of the new member states went to the rest of the EU .
Old member states also saw their sales to the new members increase to around 7.5 % of their total exports in 2007 , from 4.75 % a decade ago .
Unemployment in new member states declined to levels similar to those across the rest of the EU - around 7 % in 2007 .
" Enlargement has served as an anchor of stability , and driver of democracy and the rule of law in Europe , " Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said .
" Economically it has benefited both new and old member states , as well as the EU as a whole .
It has extended the area of peace and prosperity to almost 500 million people and increased our weight in the world , " he added .
Protectionism fears
But some of the poorer member states fear protectionism is on the rise in richer countries , our correspondent says .
Divided we will achieve nothing
Joaquin Almunia
EU Economic Affairs Commissioner
The old member states can afford to spend billions of dollars to shield their banks and industries from the crisis , he adds .
" We should not let the crisis overshadow this uncontested success .
United , we can shape the solution to global issues such as climate change or a new international financial governance , " Economic Affairs Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said .
" Divided we will achieve nothing . "
An emergency summit will take place in Brussels on 1 March partly to discuss protectionism .

I trust Google .
I use GMail as my primary email address and store stuff in my mailbox that is of crucial importance to my existence as a citizen of this modern world .
Over the past couple of months , Google ’s Orkut has dealt a deadly blow to that trust that is making me rethink my allegiance towards anything Google .
I am the owner of a midly popular community on Orkut with about 25 k users .
Since I was given the privilege of being a beta tester on Orkut , I had created a community called Calcutta many years ago and that community has since , taken on a life of its own .
It is run by moderators who report to me and I log in every so often to perform maintenance and help the moderators out .
My existence is not only a mystery to the members of the community , it is also the source of much speculation and conspiracy theories , which was fine and dandy .
The Orkut application itself is full of holes and though Google seems to respond to major public reports of vulnerabilities , they keep coming back .
Support for Orkut from Google is almost non-existent with what appears to be zero accountability .
If one plows through the Google help sections to try and solicit help , they are either faced with a page not found or convoluted help screens that barely ever actually lead to a form to request support .
Pleas for help and more often answered by the “ Orkut hackers ” than by actual Google employees .
The Orkut application is so dangerous that people do not click on any links that are not Orkut generated and even then accounts and communities are compromised all the time .
Hacking scripts and techniques are easily found via a simple Google search .
Now I am just as selfish of an individual as everyone else .
I barely cared about any of these issues until something bad happened to me that I needed help for .
I was the target of a phishing attack on Orkut and I fell for it hook line and sinker .
My Google login is associated with my Orkut login .
As soon as I realized that I had just sent my username and password to a phisher ( within a few seconds of me hitting enter ) , I changed my Google account password .
But alas , the damage had already been done .
This is where things get really weird .
Apparently , a group of “ hackers ” had taken over my Orkut profile and were making drastic changes to the Calcutta community .
Emails , IMs and phone calls started to roll in and I was in full panic .
I was immediately concerned that my Google account was still compromised and all my personal stuff in my email would be in jeopardy .
I went into damage control mode .
I changed all my authentication credentials for everything Google .
My Gmail account seemed to be untouched but my Orkut account , which uses the same login credentials ( I know that was my own fault ) , seemed to still be under rogue control .
In spite of changing my passwords multiple times , changing login names , changing email addresses and trying all authentication tricks to fix Orkut , the miscreants still regained control of my profile .
Instead of falling for the FUD about viruses and worms on my computer ( many well wishers who reported the problem to me suggested that I format my computer because i had a key logger that was sending my password to the hackers , completely untrue ) , I decided to do some research on the problem .
The more I learned , the less confidence I had in Orkut and Google ’s intention and / or ability to fix the problems .
Now the only reason I disclose this issue is because I have not only reported it to Orkut ( and received no answer ) , it appears to be the same an age old vulerability and one of many similar issues that were purportedly fixed .
You can recreate this at home if you please .
The Orkut application stores cookies in such a way that if your cookie is ever recreated by someone else or transmitted to someone else , they can use that cookie to log in to Orkut as you .
forever .
No matter how you change your credentials , you have no recourse of regaining control .
So if you ever get caught in a phishing scam that sends your password to someone else and they recreate your orkut_state cookie , they can login as you forever .
I will not go into the technical details but the link above discusses it .
If you log into your Orkut account using Firefox , using a cookie editing plugin , look for a cookie called orkut_state and copy the contents .
Then log out of Orkut .
After logging out , re-add the orkut_state cookie to Firefox with the cookie editing plugin and then visit www.orkut.com
You will find yourself logged back in .
Now I have tried changing my password , using a different browser , using a different machine from another location and other tricks with the same cookie and I have been granted access in all cases .
From my research , it appears that Orkut expires the state cookie after 1 day ( other reports talk about a 14 day expiration ) but that problem is easily circumvented .
So essentially , I am completely at the mercy of the people that have re-created my orkut_state cookie using my old password that I disclosed on the phishing site .
I have tried to contact Orkut help , posted messages in the help groups , emailed and complained to Google , emailed and complained via the Orkut complaint forms and even tried sending messages to places that are not meant to be Orkut related .
It has been over two weeks and I have yet to receive a single acknowledgment .
Nothing , nada , zip .
I do n’t mind telling you that it is despicable for a company like Google to run an extremely popular application with a complete lack of care for its netizens .
While I acknowledge that Orkut is not the most important product that Google offers , I think Google should still stand by their product .
I also acknowledge that the fact that I am in this mess is my own fault , but should n’t there be some recourse ?
Would Facebook or MySpace do the same thing ?
Are we all under the false hope that someone in these big companies actually cares about the people that use their products ?
Is the online world doomed to failure in circumstances or are we willing to make a stand only when it affects us ?
Who can I contact at Google that can even pretend to help ?
I am NOT “ negotiating ” with the hackers who have control over my profile , which has also been suggested and immidiately turned down by me .
Or is my community a complete loss because I made a mistake and fell for a phishing attack ?
I am not sure how I feel about trusting my life ’s contents to Google if this is how Google treats compromises in security .
Finding a microbicide is one of the thorniest problems in AIDS research .
Women in poor countries need a vaginal gel that blocks the AIDS virus but not sperm because many still want children .
They also need one that can be inserted secretly : for too many women , any action that implies that a partner is infected is likely to result in a beating .
And men who have sex with men may well need a microbicide that works rectally .
Previous trials of microbicides had to be stopped when they proved ineffective or even made women more likely to become infected .
New research presented in Montreal last week suggested that progress is being made , but slowly .
In a study supported by the National Institutes of Health , a new gel called Pro 2000 was tested in 3,099 women in Africa and the United States .
It appeared to protect them 30 percent better than a placebo , but researchers are awaiting results of a British study on 9,000 women .
Gels containing one or two antiretroviral drugs , tenofovir and FTC , were tested in monkeys .
They appeared to give 100 percent protection  but researchers cautioned that only six monkeys got each gel , that the gels had high doses of drugs , and that what works with simian virus in monkeys does not always work in humans .

BOSTON -- Tradition .
Timing .
Test run .
The Beanpot .
Mention the tournament in college hockey circles and it often elicits an eye roll if you 're not an alum or a fan of one of the four schools for the Garden party that takes place on the first two Mondays each February .
BU has dominated the Beanpot of late , but there 's plenty keeping the tournament going .
AP Photo / Winslow Townson
To Boston College , Boston University , Harvard and Northeastern , the Beanpot Tournament is sacred .
To the rest of the college hockey world , it 's overstated .
For the record , I did n't go to a Beanpot school and I did n't grow up in New England , so my experience with this tournament is limited to my years of covering it as a member of the media .
That said , here 's why the Beanpot is the most significant regular - season college hockey tournament .
( Notice I did n't say " best " because that 's a subjective thing . )
Tradition
The Rensselaer Holiday Tournament , which began in 1951 , is actually one year older than the Beanpot -- but tradition is not just about tenure .
The RPI tourney gets lost a bit over Thanksgiving weekend with the rest of college hockey in action .
Not to mention its rotating field can leave something to be desired .
( Remember when Merrimack beat Wayne State for the 2002 title ? )
The Great Lakes Invitational , another great tournament played each December in Detroit , has been around since 1965 .
And with an opportunity for a Michigan - Michigan State final each year at a packed Joe Louis Arena , who is going to argue about GLI 's place in the college hockey tournament universe ?
The Beanpot dates back to Dec. 27 , 1952 , when Harvard beat BU 7 - 4 at Boston Arena ( now called Matthews Arena and Northeastern 's home rink ) .
That makes it nearly as old as the NCAA tournament ( 1948 ) .
Timing
Starting in 1955 , the Beanpot was moved from its original December ( and then January ) dates to early February .
And now that it occupies the first two Mondays of the second month , there is n't any competition to speak of in college hockey .
All of which means having the stage to yourself creates extra ( although some would say undeserved ) exposure .
In some respects , it 's like " Monday Night Football . "
Regardless of the matchup , it 's the only game in any town and because of that , it usually delivers an audience .
So even the Beanpot haters end up tuning in because where else are they going to turn -- the Westminster Dog Show ?
Test run
Another added benefit to the February window is the proximity of the playoffs .
The postseason is still a month away , but coaches , players and fans alike already have an eye toward what the second season will bring .
And everyone would agree that there 's nothing like the intensity and passion of playoff hockey .
In that respect , the Beanpot helps set the stage for what lies just over the horizon .
Aside from the yearlong smack talk entitled to the winners in and around the Hub , the title game also creates a real tournament tone that can't quite be replicated in regular league play .
So think of the Beanpot final as a preview of what April 's Frozen Four in Washington , D.C. , could deliver in terms of atmosphere .
And given the quality of Monday 's matchup between No. 1 Boston University and No. 3 Northeastern ( look for Northeastern to move up to No. 2 in the national polls Monday afternoon thanks to Notre Dame 's loss at Ohio State on Sunday ) , either or both schools could realistically be playing on college hockey 's final weekend .
Brad Thiessen and Northeastern look for their first Beanpot title since 1988 .
Jim Pierce
Need another reason to watch the top two ranked teams in the country play at Boston 's sold out TDBanknorth Garden ?
The past six Beanpot title games were one - goal affairs and four of the past five have gone to overtime .
Then there are the 13 draft picks that should be on the ice Monday night .
Five of BU 's six defensemen have ties to an NHL club and the sixth , captain Matt Gilroy , turned down a reported 23 offers to sign as a free agent last spring so that he could return for his senior season .
The Beanpot is often referred to as the BU Invitational because the Terriers have won 28 of the 56 tournaments , including 14 of the past 20 .
In that time frame , the Huskies of Huntington Avenue have won , well , zero Beanpots .
Northeastern has just four titles to its credit with the last one coming in 1988 .
" The drought that Northeastern has experienced over these years , it does weigh on us , " Northeastern coach Greg Cronin said .
" They 're kids , you can't filter out the media attention . "
This will mark the 11th time BU and Northeastern have met in the Beanpot final with the Terriers holding a 7 - 3 edge and a four - game winning streak in those games .
When the Huskies last beat BU in a Beanpot final , on Feb. 8 , 1988 , four current Northeastern players had n't been born .
" Colleges like BC or BU , kids go there and put on the jersey and it's kind of expected that they have it in them that they 're going to win , " Northeastern goalie Brad Thiessen said .
" At Northeastern , what we 're trying to do is instill it in our program as well so we can go out there and believe that we 're going to win every night . "
In their only meeting so far this season , BU blanked Northeastern 3 - 0 on Nov. 16 .
After Monday night , the two play a home - and - home series on Feb. 20 - 21 which should play a big role in determining the Hockey East regular - season champion , but it 's a safe to say that weekend wo n't quite match the feel of a Beanpot final .
For Northeastern 's six seniors , it 's one final crack at trying to feed the Huskies ' Beanpot famine .
And it 's a second straight week of playing in the late game , something that was n't lost on Cronin 's players .
" The energy was amazing , " Northeastern 's Ryan Ginand said after scoring a goal in the 6 - 1 win over defending champ Boston College in the first round Feb .
2 . " I did n't know what it was like and now I know .
It was unbelievable .
Now I can't wait for [ Monday ] night . "
Me , too .

Paul Buchheit , the original lead developer of GMail , notes that the success of GMail was a long time in coming :
We starting working on Gmail in August 2001 .
For a long time , almost everyone disliked it .
Some people used it anyway because of the search , but they had endless complaints .
Quite a few people thought that we should kill the project , or perhaps " reboot " it as an enterprise product with native client software , not this crazy Javascript stuff .
Even when we got to the point of launching it on April 1 , 2004 -- two and a half years after starting work on it -- many people inside of Google were predicting doom .
The product was too weird , and nobody wants to change email services .
I was told that we would never get a million users .
Once we launched , the response was surprisingly positive , except from the people who hated it for a variety of reasons .
Nevertheless , it was frequently described as " niche " , and " not used by real people outside of silicon valley " .
Now , almost 7 1/2 years after we started working on Gmail , I see [ an article describing how Gmail grew 40 % last year , compared to 2 % for Yahoo and - 7 % for Hotmail ] .
Paul has since left Google and now works at his own startup , FriendFeed .
Many industry insiders have not been kind to FriendFeed .
Stowe Boyd even went so far as to call FriendFeed a failure .
Paul takes this criticism in stride :
Creating an important new product generally takes time .
FriendFeed needs to continue changing and improving , just as Gmail did six years ago .
FriendFeed shows a lot of promise , but it 's still a " work in progress " .
My expectation is that big success takes years , and there are n't many counter - examples ( other than YouTube , and they did n't actually get to the point of making piles of money just yet ) .
Facebook grew very fast , but it 's almost 5 years old at this point .
Larry and Sergey started working on Google in 1996 -- when I started there in 1999 , few people had heard of it yet .
This notion of overnight success is very misleading , and rather harmful .
If you 're starting something new , expect a long journey .
That 's no excuse to move slow though .
To the contrary , you must move very fast , otherwise you will never arrive , because it 's a long journey !
This is also why it 's important to be frugal -- you do n't want to starve to death halfway up the mountain .
Stowe Boyd illustrated his point about FriendFeed with a graph comparing Twitter and FriendFeed traffic .
Allow me to update Mr. Boyd 's graph with another data point of my own .
I find Paul 's attitude refreshing , because I take the same attitude toward our startup , Stack Overflow .
I have zero expectation or even desire for overnight success .
What I am planning is several years of grinding through constant , steady improvement .
This business plan is n't much different from my career development plan : success takes years .
And when I say years , I really mean it !
Not as some cliched regurgitation of " work smarter , not harder . "
I 'm talking actual calendar years .
You know , of the 12 months , 365 days variety .
You will literally have to spend multiple years of your life grinding away at this stuff , waking up every day and doing it over and over , practicing and gathering feedback each day to continually get better .
It might be unpleasant at times and even downright un - fun occasionally , but it 's necessary .
This is hardly unique or interesting advice .
Peter Norvig 's classic Teach Yourself Programming in Ten Years already covered this topic far better than I .
Researchers have shown it takes about ten years to develop expertise in any of a wide variety of areas , including chess playing , music composition , telegraph operation , painting , piano playing , swimming , tennis , and research in neuropsychology and topology .
The key is deliberative practice : not just doing it again and again , but challenging yourself with a task that is just beyond your current ability , trying it , analyzing your performance while and after doing it , and correcting any mistakes .
Then repeat .
And repeat again .
There appear to be no real shortcuts : even Mozart , who was a musical prodigy at age 4 , took 13 more years before he began to produce world - class music .
The Beatles seemed to burst onto the scene with a string of # 1 hits and an appearance on the Ed Sullivan show in 1964 .
But they had been playing small clubs in Liverpool and Hamburg since 1957 , and while they had mass appeal early on , their first great critical success , Sgt. Peppers , was released in 1967 .
Honestly , I look forward to waking up someday two or three years from now and doing the exact same thing I did today : working on the Stack Overflow code , eking out yet another tiny improvement or useful feature .
Obviously we want to succeed .
But on some level , success is irrelevant , because the process is inherently satisfying .
Waking up every day and doing something you love -- even better , surrounded by a community who loves it too -- is its own reward .
Despite being a metric ton of work .
The blog is no different .
I often give aspiring bloggers this key piece of advice : if you 're starting a blog , do n't expect anyone to read it for six months .
If you do , I can guarantee you will be sorely disappointed .
However , if you can stick to a posting schedule and produce one or two quality posts every week for an entire calendar year ... then , and only then , can you expect to see a trickle of readership .
I started this blog in 2004 , and it took a solid three years of writing 3 to 5 times per week before it achieved anything resembling popularity within the software development community .
I fully expect to be writing on this blog , in one form or another , for the rest of my life .
It is a part of who I am .
And with that bit of drama out of the way , I have no illusions : ultimately , I 'm just the guy on the internet who writes that blog .
That 's perfectly fine by me .
I never said I was clever .
Whether you ultimately achieve readers , or pageviews , or whatever high score table it is we 're measuring this week , try to remember it 's worth doing because , well -- it 's worth doing .
And if you keep doing it long enough , who knows ?
You might very well wake up one day and find out you 're an overnight success .

The mayor ’s preliminary budget released Friday proposes to amend state law to allow for traffic - light cameras at “ unlimited locations ” in the city and to raise the fine from $ 50 to $ 100 .
“ The program has been successful , and we want to expand it , ” Mayor Bloomberg spokesman Marc LaVorgna said .
The state Legislature has capped the number of cameras at 100 .
The cameras snap photos of cars passing through a red light – including the license plate .
The registered owner of the vehicle is automatically mailed a ticket .
The preliminary budget calls for adding 20 more cameras , which would bring in $ 6.2 million in fiscal year 2009 - 10 .
In his latest budget proposal , Gov. Paterson supported the removal of the cap on cameras .
The Legislature would also have to approve the measure .
“ If the state legislation becomes a reality , we would be free to continue to add cameras as needed , ” LaVorgna said of the city program .
Bloomberg unveiled a series of draconian proposals Friday in a spending plan that seeks to close a $ 4 billion deficit next fiscal year .
The budget would chop 23,000 city jobs , including 14,722 teacher positions .
Yesterday , Bloomberg urged educators to lobby Albany to restore $ 770 million in education aid or use federal stimulus money to make up the difference .
“ We need our fair share , and I ’m not asking for anything more than a fair share of revenue sharing and a fair share of education aid , ” Bloomberg said .
“ We send 50 percent of the state ’s revenue to Albany , we have 40 percent of the population .
The governor ’s budget cut our revenue sharing to zero .
It ’s hard to argue if that ’s fair . ”

Apparently , nobody writes tokenizers like this
Call me crazy , but I 've never really seen the point of so - called " parser generators " and " lexical analyzer generators " in real life .
Almost any file has syntax that 's so simple , it 's easy to just parse it yourself .
And languages that are more complicated or have tight parser performance requirements - like C++ compilers or Ruby interpreters - tend to have hand - rolled parsers because the automatic parser generators can't do it .
So who benefits from automatic parser generators ?
I do n't know .
I feel like I 'm missing something .
This feeling came up again the other day when I found I had to parse and produce some XML files at work - in Delphi .
Having seen lots of advice in lots of places that " the first thing a new programmer does with XML is to try , and fail , to write his own XML parser , " I was hesitant .
Okay , I thought .
Why not look into one of those well - known , fancy pants XML parsers that will surely solve my problem in two seconds flat ?
Well , I looked into them .
Much more than two seconds later , I emerged , horrified .
How can you guys possibly make parsing a text file so complicated ?
Why , after adding your tool , does my project now seem more difficult than it did when I started ?
I still do n't know .
Look guys , I really tried .
But I just do n't understand why I 'd want to use a DTD .
Or twelve layers of abstraction .
Or the " structured " way you completely reject ( with confusing error messages ) almost - but - not - quite valid XML files , in clear violation of Jon Postel 's robustness principle .
So I broke down and wrote an XML parser myself .
In Delphi .
In about 500 lines .
In an afternoon .
I 'm sure I left out major portions of the XML spec , but you know what ?
It parses the file the customer sent me , and the Big Fancy Professional XML Library did n't , because it said the file was invalid .
I guess that makes me a clueless newbie .
But back to tokenizers
As an odd coincidence , someone I know was doing some ( much less redundant ) work on parsing a different file format at around the same time .
As anyone who has done parsers should know , most parsers are divided into two main parts : lexical analysis ( which I 'll call " tokenizing " ) and parsing .
I agree with this distinction .
Unfortunately , that seems to be where my formal education ends , because I just can't figure out why lexical analysis is supposed to be so difficult .
Almost all the lexical analyzers I 've seen have been state machines driven by a single main loop , with a whole bunch of if statements and / or a switch / case statement and / or function pointers and / or giant object inheritance hierarchies .
Sure enough , the person I was talking to was writing just such a tokenizer in python - with lambdas and all the rest .
The problem is I just do n't understand why all that stuff should be necessary .
Traditional lexical analysis seems to be based on the theory that you need to have a single outer main loop , or you 'll be inefficient / redundant / impure .
But what I think is that loop constructs are generally only a single line of code ; it does n't cost you anything to put loops in twelve different places .
So that 's what I did .
I suppose that makes me a newbie .
But it works .
And my code is more readable than his .
In fact , when I showed him a copy , he was amazed at how simple it is .
He actually called it brilliant .
Seriously .
To be honest , I still feel like I must be missing something .
And yet here we are .
... so without further ado , my XML tokenizer , in 62 lines of Pascal .
For your convenience , I have highlighted the blasphemous parts .

Version History
What could be simpler than a glass of orange juice ?
The beverage holds a place in the pantheon of wholesome American breakfast foods , on equal footing with toast , cereal , and eggs .
It 's pure and natural , ads tell us , and we buy both the sentiment and the product .
More than 620 million gallons of orange juice are sold per year in the United States , according to market research from Nielsen .
Author Alissa Hamilton would have us take another look at the glass on the breakfast table .
That simplicity is actually the result of a complicated process - juice stored in tanks for long periods , then goosed with flavor packs to taste like fruit again .
Her book , " Squeezed : What You Don't Know About Orange Juice , " due out in May from Yale University Press , reveals that orange juice , with its image as a natural Florida product , bears the fingerprints of chemists and is often shipped from South America .
Hamilton traces the history of the drink , first processed in the United States in the early 1900s as a canned juice that was said to taste like " battery acid . "
World War II ushered in the age of palatable processed orange juice , with the military seeking a source of vitamin C that soldiers would readily consume .
In 1948 , frozen concentrate was born , too late for the war effort but in time to help revive an ailing citrus industry , which was struggling with a surplus of fruit .
A further boost from Bing Crosby , who crooned about Minute Maid in radio ads , and OJ was on its way to becoming America 's favorite breakfast drink .
Since then , the citrus industry and its technologies have changed .
The FDA tussled with manufacturers to set standards for orange juice .
What remains constant ?
Marketing - some of it deceptive , says Hamilton .
If orange juice is n't harmful , it also is n't what it 's portrayed to be .
Consumers have a right to know what they are consuming , Hamilton says , and that is at the heart of her story .
Ideas spoke with the author , a Woodcock Foundation - funded food and society policy fellow , by phone at her home in Toronto .
IDEAS : You write that the first question everyone asks when they hear about the book is whether orange juice is good for us .
So - is orange juice good for us ?
HAMILTON : I tell people if you like it , drink it , but not because you think it 's good for you .
You'd be better off with a whole orange than a glass of orange juice .
It has more fiber and more vitamin C . But I 'm not a dietitian .
The book is not about whether you should drink orange juice and whether it 's healthy .
It 's about how little consumers know about how popular and - in the case of orange juice - seemingly straightforward foods are produced and the repercussions for agriculture .
ORCHARD PARK , N.Y. , Nov. 5 ( UPI ) -- Security officers at Ralph Wilson Stadium in Orchard Park , N.Y. , said a reported disturbance in a ladies ' restroom turned out to be a couple having sex .
Police said Alicia Venneman , 29 , was charged with disorderly conduct and her boyfriend , Jeramy Kemper , 31 , was charged with trespassing and resisting arrest after they were caught having sex in the women 's bathroom across from Section 336 of the stadium during Sunday 's game between the Buffalo Bills and the New York Jets , The Buffalo ( N.Y . )
News reported Wednesday .

" This was inappropriate behavior in public , " Scott Berchtold , Bills vice president of communications , said .
" Our security staff reacted accordingly , and law enforcement officials were called in to handle the situation . "
Orchard Park police and Erie County sheriff 's deputies said 37 arrests were made before , during and after the game .
Law enforcement officials said it was well above the average number of arrests made surrounding a Bills home game .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- President Obama struck down a rule Friday that prohibits U.S. money from funding international family - planning clinics that promote abortion or provide counseling or referrals about abortion services .
President Obama says he does n't want family planning to be used as a " political wedge . "
Obama said in a statement that family planning aid has been used as a " political wedge issue , " adding that he had " no desire to continue this stale and fruitless debate . "
The policy says any organization receiving U.S. family - planning funds from the U.S. Agency for International Development cannot offer abortions or abortion counseling .
" It is time we end the politicization of this issue , " Obama said .
" In the coming weeks , my administration will initiate a fresh conversation on family planning , working to find areas of common ground to best meet the needs of women and families at home and around the world . "
Obama 's memorandum reversing the policy comes the day after the 36th anniversary of Roe v. Wade .
The landmark 1973 U.S. Supreme Court decision held that a woman 's right to an abortion fell within the right to privacy protected by the 14th Amendment .
The ruling gave a woman autonomy over her pregnancy during the first trimester .
Watch CNN 's Bill Schneider on how Obama is handling abortion issue »
The memorandum reverses the " Mexico City policy , " initiated by President Reagan in 1984 , canceled by President Clinton and reinstated by President George W. Bush in 2001 .
The policy , referred to by critics as " the global gag rule , " was initially announced at a population conference in Mexico City .
Reversing the previous administrations ' stance on the policy was one of Clinton 's first acts as president in January 1993 and the very first executive order issued by Bush on January 22 , 2001 , the 28th anniversary of Roe v. Wade .
Critics , including Planned Parenthood , called Bush 's move a " legislative ambush . "
He defended his action , saying , " It is my conviction that taxpayer funds should not be used to pay for abortion or actively promote abortion . "
The group Population Action International praised Obama 's move , saying in a statement that it will " save women 's lives around the world . "
" Family planning should not be a political issue ; it 's about basic health care and well - being for women and children , " the group said .
" Women 's health has been severely impacted by the cutoff of assistance .
President Obama 's actions will help reduce the number of unintended pregnancies , abortions and women dying from high - risk pregnancies because they do n't have access to family planning . "
Republican lawmakers were critical of the new president 's action .
" Not even waiting a week , the new administration has acted to funnel U.S. tax dollars to abortion providers overseas , " Rep .
Tom Price , R - Georgia , said in a written statement .
" This is a stunning reversal of course from the president 's campaign statements that he hoped to reduce the number of abortions .
Just a day after thousands of Americans came to Washington to celebrate the principle of life , President Obama has made it clear that reducing abortions is not one of his priorities . "
In his statement , however , Obama said he had directed his staff " to reach out to those on all sides of this issue to achieve the goal of reducing unintended pregnancies . "
" They will also work to promote safe motherhood , reduce maternal and infant mortality rates and increase educational and economic opportunities for women and girls . "
The president added that he looked forward to " working with Congress to restore U.S. financial support for the U.N. Population Fund . "
The Bush administration has repeatedly withheld funding authorized by Congress for the U.N. fund , saying the agency has funded a forced sterilization program in China .
The fund has repeatedly denied that accusation .
" By signaling his intention to restore U.S. funding for UNFPA , the UN Population Fund , President Barack Obama is signaling his re-engagement with the international community on the critical challenge of improving reproductive health around the world , " UN Foundation President Timothy Wirth said .
" For the past seven years , UNFPA funding has been a victim of false accusations and misinformation that had everything to do with politics and nothing to do with sound policy , " he said .
" Approximately 180 industrialized and developing countries , including all the countries in sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America , contribute to UNFPA .
The United States was the only country to withhold funding for political reasons . "

The Robotic Intelligence Lab from the University of Wales has been studying ant behavior .
They hope to put this behavior into 8 e-puck robots , the lab hopes to acquire 25 more robots soon , to form a society of robots .
Dr Torbjorn Dahl of the Robotic Intelligence Laboratory states :
Our aim is to create a mini-society of robots with built - in behavioural patterns that enable them to not only do tasks set them but also realize what else needs to be done , as worker ants do .
The key word here folks is realize , as in it can think for itself .
Mankind ’s doom will not come from Terminator style robots , but from many small robots forming a swarm like these .

Microsoft on Monday made its latest bid to stem share loses in the mobile sector with a new version of its Windows Mobile software that includes an online store for third - party applications and also ties into a new cloud service for syncing mobile data .
Presenting at the Mobile World Congress 2009 in Barcelona , the Redmond - based software giant said it 's signed deals with a number of top - tier mobile partners to deliver the next generation of Windows phones that will run Windows Mobile 6.5 , which features a new user interface and a richer browsing experience when it becomes available during the second half of the year .
The same phones will also debut two new services similar to those offered by rival Apple to users of its iPhone handsets :
My Phone , to sync text messages , photos , video , contacts — but not email — to the Web ; and Windows Marketplace for Mobile , a new online application shop that will provide direct - to - phone mobile applications and can be accessed from both the phone and the Web .
â Windows phones bring together the best of the Web , the PC and the phone so you can connect instantly to the experiences you care about , no matter where you are , â said Microsoft chief executive Steve Ballmer .
â Weâre working with partners across the industry to deliver a new generation of Windows phones that break down the barriers between people , information and applications and provide great end - to - end experiences that span your entire life , at work and at home .â 
Windows Mobile 6.5
One of the highlights of the new Windows Mobile software is a touch - screen interface with a honeycomb Start screen " designed for use with your fingers to accurately select the application , folder , game or setting quickly and easily . "
Users who password protect their handsets will also see a new Lock screen that will allow responses to interactive user interface elements â such as those for missed calls , voice mail , e-mail , text and calendar items â with a simple PIN without unlocking the entire device .
Windows Mobile 6.5 : Lock screen ( left ) , Start screen ( center ) , Internet Explorer mobile ( right ) .
Windows Mobile 6.5 phones will also ship with a new Internet Explorer Mobile browser that promises " desktop - quality rendering " similar to that provided by Apple 's version of mobile Safari .
The browser will also let users search in the address bar of the browser like the iPhone and support Adobe Flash Lite , which the Apple handset does not .
My Phone
Microsoft formally announced its answer to portions of Apple 's MobileMe service with a complimentary mobile data sync service conveniently called My Phone .
The My Phone service will let users view and manage photos on their phone from the Web ..
While both services offer to sync settings , contacts , and calendar data , as well as present a web interface for accessing and editing the same data , My Phone also serves as an online version of some of the features of iTunes , allowing it to backup the entire phone device to the cloud and then restore that image to a new phone .
The service , which is currently available in a limited invitation - only beta , also offers to sync photos and video taken by Windows Mobile phones to its online service , similar to how the iPhone can upload photos to a MobileMe gallery .
For more on My Phone and how it compares to MobileMe on the iPhone , please see the AppleInsider report titled , Microsoft plays catch up to MobileMe with My Phone .
Windows Mobile Marketplace
Perhaps the most significant of Microsoft 's announcements are plans to take on Apple 's App Store with a similar service dubbed Windows Marketplace for searching , browsing and purchasing mobile applications from Windows phones or from a PC by using a Windows Live ID .
The new marketplace will be included with all Windows phones based on Windows Mobile 6.5 and allow developers to offer applications to customers through a security and compatibility check facilitated by Microsoft .
New Windows Mobile Handsets
As part of its announcements Monday , Microsoft said it has inked a new deal with LG , the world 's third - leading handset vendor , to install Windows Mobile on the majority of its phones .
The LG - GM730 — making its debut with a custom version of Windows Mobile 6.1 — will reportedly be the first smartphone to use new version of Windows Mobile OS integrated with LG 's advanced 3D S - Class User Interface .
" The combination of Windows Mobile and our new 3D S - Class User Interface will make the LG - GM730 the most functional and easiest to use smartphone ever created , " said Dr. Skott Ahn , President and CEO of LG Mobile Communications Company .
" This phone is a springboard for us .
We will launch a number of smartphones this year ; most of them will follow this same winning formula . "
The LG - GM730 will make its debut in the coming months but is unlikely to be sold in North America .
LG 's S - Class UI skin sports a 3D cube layout , four customizable home screens , simplified email setup , and " flick of a finger " navigation , while the LG - GM730 itself supports 7.2Mbps HSDPA , 2 M bps HSUPA , and Quadband EDGE .
Additional specifications will be announced before the phone goes on sale in the first half of 2009 .
Similarly , HTCâs Touch Diamond 2 and Touch Pro 2 , also announced Monday , will be upgradeable to Windows Mobile 6.5 .
Currently based on a customized version of Windows Mobile 6.1 , the Touch Diamond 2 features TouchFLO 3D , a slim design with a large 3.2 - inch high - resolution wide - screen display , while HTC Touch Pro 2 introduces new Straight Talk technology , an integrated e-mail , voice and speakerphone experience .
HTC 's Touch Diamond 2 .
The Touch Diamond 2 is expected to hit major European and Asian markets early next quarter , with broader global availability coming later in the year .
Among the handset 's features are :
Larger 3.2 - inch high resolution wide - screen VGA display for a greater viewing area
13.7 mm thick
New touch sensitive zoom bar for even faster zooming of Web pages , emails , text messages , photos or documents
Optimized for one - hand use
50 % better battery life
5 MP auto focus camera
Expandable memory
Gravity sensor

Terry Moran at ABC News interviewed President Obama today ( airs tonight ) .
Here are some excerpts : ( hat tip Paul Kedrosky )
TERRY MORAN : There are a lot of economists who look at these banks and they say all that garbage that 's in them renders them essentially insolvent .
Why not just nationalize the banks ?
PRESIDENT OBAMA : Well , you know , it 's interesting .
There are two countries who have gone through some big financial crises over the last decade or two .
One was Japan , which never really acknowledged the scale and magnitude of the problems in their banking system and that resulted in what 's called " The Lost Decade . "
They kept on trying to paper over the problems .
The markets sort of stayed up because the Japanese government kept on pumping money in .
But , eventually , nothing happened and they did n't see any growth whatsoever .
Sweden , on the other hand , had a problem like this .
They took over the banks , nationalized them , got rid of the bad assets , resold the banks and , a couple years later , they were going again .
So you 'd think looking at it , Sweden looks like a good model .
Here 's the problem ; Sweden had like five banks .
[ LAUGHS ]
We 've got thousands of banks .
You know , the scale of the U.S. economy and the capital markets are so vast and the problems in terms of managing and overseeing anything of that scale , I think , would -- our assessment was that it would n't make sense .
And we also have different traditions in this country .
Obviously , Sweden has a different set of cultures in terms of how the government relates to markets and America 's different .
And we want to retain a strong sense of that private capital fulfilling the core -- core investment needs of this country .
And so , what we 've tried to do is to apply some of the tough love that 's going to be necessary , but do it in a way that 's also recognizing we 've got big private capital markets and ultimately that 's going to be the key to getting credit flowing again .
[ S] aying that Sweden had five banks and the U.S. has thousands , so nationalization can’t happen here , is misleading .
It ignores the relative GDPs of the two countries .
...[ and ] the problem is chiefly in the six largest U.S. banks ...
[ W ] hy is the US government temporizing and avoiding doing the right thing , i.e. take over the insolvent banks ?
There are two reasons .
First , there is still some small hope and a small probability that the economy will recover sooner than expected , that expected credit losses will be smaller than expected and that the current approach of recapping the banks and somehow working out the bad assets will work in due time .
Second , taking over the banks – call is nationalization or , in a more politically correct way , “ receivership ” – is a radical action that requires most banks be clearly beyond pale and insolvent to be undertaken .
Today Citi and Bank of America clearly look like near - insolvent and ready to be taken over but JPMorgan and Wells Fargo do not yet .
But with the sharp rise in delinquencies and charge - off rates that we are experiencing now on mortgages , commercial real estate and consumer credit in a matter of six to twelve months even JPMorgan and Wells will likely look as near - insolvent ( as suggested by Chris Whalen , one of the leading independent analysts of the banking system ) .
Thus , if the government were to take over only Citi and Bank of America today ( and wipe out common and preferred shareholders and also force unsecured creditors to take a haircut ) a panic may ensue ...
Instead if , as likely , the current fudging strategy - of temporizing and hoping that things will improve for the economy and the banks - does not work and in 6 - 12 months most banks ( the major four and the a good part of the remaining regional banks ) all look like clearly insolvent you can then take them all over , wipe out common shareholders and preferred shareholders and even force unsecured creditors to accept losses ( in the form of a conversion of debt into equity and / or haircut on the face value of their bond claims ) as the losses will be so large that not treating such unsecured creditors would be fiscally too expensive .
So , the current strategy – Plan A - may not work and the Plan B ( or better Plan N for nationalization ) may end up the way to go later this year .
Wasting another 6 - 12 months to do the right thing may be a mistake but the political constrains facing the new administration – and the remaining small probability that the current strategy may by some miracle or luck work – suggest that Plan A should be first exhausted before there is a move to Plan N. Wasting another 6 - 12 months may risk turning a U - shaped recession into an L - shaped near depression but currently Plan N is not yet politically feasible .
Kedrosky comments
On the issue of " cultural differences " between the U.S. and Sweden , I 've joked that we should call taking over the banks " preprivatization " to avoid the stigma of " nationalization " .
But stop and think about what Obama is saying .
We know the correct answer , but we are afraid to do it - because of our " culture " - so we are going to follow the Japanese plan .
We should definitely stress test the banks .
My suggestion : announce when this will be complete ( within 30 days ) , make the results public , and preprivatize the insolvent ones .

Two planes belonging to Sri Lanka 's Tamil Tiger rebels have attacked the capital Colombo , killing two people and injuring about 45 , officials say .
Both planes were downed , one of them hitting inland revenue offices , where the casualties occurred , officials said .
The building was badly damaged .
The other plane was shot down near the city 's airport , which was closed .
The raid comes as the army has driven the Tigers into a shrinking zone of jungle in the north of Sri Lanka .
We were right in the middle of an arc of gunfire and there were search lights into the sky trying to pick out aircraft
Barry Walker
British man in Colombo
Eyewitness : Air raid Rebels attack despite losses A pro-rebel website , TamilNet , said the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LTTE ) had claimed what it described as " successful air raids " .
They involved " diving into Sri Lanka Air Force ( SLAF ) Headquarters in Colombo and into the SLAF base at Katunayaka " , 35 km ( 21 miles ) north of the capital , the website said .
TamilNet named the two pilots as Col Roopan and Lt Col Siriththiran - describing them as decorated pilots from the " Black Air Tigers " squad - and showed a picture purportedly of the men with Tamil leader Velupillai Prabhakaran .
Correspondents say the attack amounts to a major embarrassment for Sri Lanka 's government , which had claimed to have destroyed all the rebels ' hidden runways and put its small air force out of action .
' Massive explosion '
The city was put on full alert at about 2130 ( 1600 GMT ) on Friday as electricity was cut and searchlights and tracer fire from anti-aircraft guns cut through the night sky .
One of the aircraft crashed in marshland near an airport Briton Barry Walker told the BBC that he was in a central Colombo hotel when the blackout hit .
" We were sitting by the swimming pool when we heard firing of heavy anti-aircraft guns .
Heavy shell fire .
This lasted 20 - 25 minutes ... then there was a massive explosion , " he said .
Mr Walker and other guests were ushered into the hotel 's basement for about two hours until the all - clear was given .
Another witness told the BBC he saw a low - flying aircraft and then heard a huge explosion by the city 's fort , where many government offices are located .
The air force headquarters , which is in the same area , may have been the target , correspondents say .
Jets scrambled
The ministry of defence said a tax office of the inland revenue department was in flames after one of the planes went down into the building .

Most of the windows in the high - rise office block were blown out and several floors were gutted by fire .
The other plane was shot down next to the international airport , just outside Colombo , and the body of its pilot had been found , defence spokesman Keheliya Rambukwella said .
Witnesses at the airport told Associated Press news agency that anti-aircraft guns had been firing followed by an explosion .
Military spokesman Brig Udaya Nanayakkara said the alert began when a suspected Tamil Tiger aircraft was spotted north - east of Colombo and the capital 's air defences were activated .
Air force jets were scrambled to engage the planes .

The attack comes as a major Sri Lankan army offensive has inflicted a series of defeats on the Tamil Tiger forces , pushing the rebels into a narrow area of jungle in the north of Sri Lanka .
The Tigers have used light planes in the past to attack Colombo and military targets in other areas of Sri Lanka .
The Tigers were believed to have a number of two - seater Czech - made Zlin - 143 aircraft fitted with homemade bombing equipment .
The propeller - driven planes were reportedly smuggled into the country in pieces before being reassembled and modified to carry bombs .
About 70,000 people have died in the last 25 years as the Tigers have been fighting for a separate homeland in the north and east of the country .

Ebola Reston in pigs and humans in the Philippines
3 February 2009 - On 23 January 2009 , the Government of the Philippines announced that a person thought to have come in contact with sick pigs had tested positive for Ebola Reston Virus ( ERV ) antibodies ( IgG ) .
On 30 January 2009 the Government announced that a further four individuals had been found positive for ERV antibodies : two farm workers in Bulacan and one farm worker in Pangasinan - the two farms currently under quarantine in northern Luzon because of ERV infection was found in pigs - and one butcher from a slaughterhouse in Pangasinan .
The person announced on 23 January to have tested positive for ERV antibodies is reported to be a backyard pig farmer from Valenzuela City - a neighbourhood within Metro Manila .
The Philippine Department of Health has said that the people who tested positive appear to be in good health and have not suffered from any significant illnesses in the past 12 months .
The investigation team reported that it was possible that all 5 individuals had been exposed to the virus as a result of direct contact with sick pigs .
The use of personal protective equipment ( PPE ) is not common practice among these animal handlers .
From these observations and previous studies of ERV , the virus has shown it can be transmitted to humans , without resulting in illness .
However , the evidence available relates only to healthy adults and it would be premature to conclude the health effects of the virus on all population groups .
The threat to human health is likely to be low for healthy adults but is unknown for all other population groups , such as immuno - compromised persons , persons with underlying medical conditions , pregnant women and children .
The Philippine Government is conducting contact tracing in relation to the five individuals who tested positive for antibodies .
In addition , testing is ongoing for other persons who could have come into contact with sick pigs on the two quarantined farms in the provinces of Bulacan and Pangasinan where pigs co-infected with the Porcine Respiratory and Reproductive Syndrome ( PRRS ) and ERV were reported in 2008 .
The two farms remain under quarantine and the Philippine Government is maintaining its voluntary hold of exports of live pigs and fresh and frozen pork meat .
The Philippine Government has announced a combined Department of Health and Department of Agriculture strategy to limit the animal and human health risks of the Ebola Reston Virus and emphasized that local governments , the pig farming industry and the public will play a critical role in the strategy .
Along with its international partners , the WHO will continue to support the Philippine Government in its efforts to gain a better understanding of the Ebola Reston virus , its effects on humans , and the measures that need to be taken to reduce any risks to human health .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
A federal anti-terror law that requires longshoremen , truckers and others to submit to criminal background checks has ensnared another class of transportation worker -- mule drivers .
Mule skinners must abide by federal law and apply for Transportation Worker Identification Credentials , TSA says .
Yes , so - called mule skinners -- in this case , seasonal workers who dress in colonial garb at a historical park in Easton , Pa. -- must apply for biometric Transportation Worker Identification Credentials ( TWIC ) , according to the Transportation Security Administration , which says it is bound by federal law .
The requirement has officials of the Hugh Moore Historical Park perplexed .
" We have one boat .
It 's pulled by two mules .
On a good day they might go 2 miles per hour , " said Sarah B . Hays , the park 's director of operations .
The park 's two - mile canal does not pass any military bases , nuclear power plants or other sensitive facilities .
And , park officials say , the mules could be considered weapons of mass destruction only if they were aimed at something resembling food .
In December , Hayes wrote to Rep. Charles Dent , R - Pennsylvania , about the requirement .
Dent , in turn , wrote to the TSA requesting a waiver , noting the mode of transportation involved was " mule - drawn canal boats . "
In January , the TSA responded , noting the Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002 applies to all mariners holding U.S. Coast Guard - issued credentials .
" We encourage the crew members ... who possess Coast Guard mariner credentials to obtain a TWIC at their earliest convenience to comply with these requirements and not risk suspension or revocation of their other credentials , " the TSA wrote .
Do n't Miss
New homeland security chief dives right in
On Wednesday , the mule skinner debate reached Capitol Hill , when Dent asked new Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano about the necessity of conducting background checks on mule drivers .
He displayed a photo of two mules , Hank and George , tugging a canal boat in the company of two park employee mule drivers in colonial working attire .
" Now Hank and George , while sometimes are ornery , they are not terrorists , " Dent said .
Napolitano said she would try to be flexible .
" Obviously this is a picture designed to say ' Hey , is n't it absurd that they be required to have TWIC cards . ' "
Napolitano said .
" Um , let 's work with you on this particular case , if we might . "
Park officials say four or five park employees typically have Coast Guard credentials to operate the canal boat , and the extra expense of a TWIC card , which is at least an extra $ 100 on top of fees for Coast Guard credentials , is unwelcome .
" I think the rule was written and the policy was set up for all the big shipping , and they never even considered something outside the normal bounds , " Hays said .
Dent said he will work on a " common sense " solution with Napolitano .

There ’s a real estate site called RedFin that allows you to quickly and effectively search for all of the available homes in a particular neighborhood .
According to the site ’s listings , there are roughly 100 homes for sale in what is an approximately . 15 - square mile area northeast of my apartment — and that ’s not even counting those that are currently under contract .
I ’m talking about an area that is only three blocks long and seven blocks wide , with over 100 homes just sitting on the market .
Only 274 Baltimore City homes were sold in the month of January .
That ’s a nearly 25 percent decrease from last year .
Area news outlets are reporting staggering foreclosure numbers : “ close to 800 in Baltimore County alone with nearly 700 more pursuing short sales to avoid what may be the inevitable . ”
Those numbers will likely go up , residential rehabilitation projects have stalled , and the area ’s market is expected to continue depreciating through at least mid-2010 .
All of this despite the fact that , according The Baltimore Sun , area home prices have taken “ the biggest year - to - year plunge in almost a decade [ . ] ”
In the last month alone , the average asking price per home in Baltimore City has decreased by 14 percent ; but the number of homes sold continues to fall as well .
Now is the time to buy , but not enough people are taking the bait .
My husband and I did , though , and are currently in the process of buying our first home .
It started when a place across the street from our apartment — a beautiful , red brick rowhouse that we never would ’ve dreamed of purchasing — slashed its asking price and fell into the top end of our range .
Our neighborhood is littered with “ For Sale ” signs .
Homes that would have sold for nearly half a million just a few years ago have been on the market for hundreds of days , some even more than a year , their prices dropping by another $ 20 - $ 50,000 every few months .
Smaller properties — starter homes that a young couple without children would naturally gravitate towards — have been falling as well .
Suddenly , a neighborhood that we could just barely afford to rent in has become a place where we could realistically purchase a house .
While market depreciation has opened the door to a wider range of potential buyers , it has also greatly limited purchasing options .
With house prices dropping further each month , the market should be a buyers ’ free - for - all .
Instead , the depreciation has led to a paradoxical situation from a buyer ’s standpoint : as the number of available houses in your price range expands , the number that you could realistically purchase does not .
There are a few reasons for this problem , the first being actual sales .
Homebuyers are waiting at the ready for prices to drop .
If the asking price for a home has been cut once , you can pretty much bet it will be cut again .
Buyers who are serious about taking advantage of the low market are going to know exactly what price range is most desirable for them and just how much they are willing to spend above that range .
You look at houses that are just above what you ’d like to pay , cross your fingers that the prices will fall once more , and when they do , you pounce .
The beautiful place across the street from our apartment spent a total of two weeks at a price we could manage .
The day we went to see it , there was already another offer .
One day later , it went under contract and was gone .
That house was on the market for 197 days before its third and final price cut .
There ’s also the issue of short sales , which are , to put it simply , not short at all .
A short sale occurs when a seller attempts to unload a house for less than he or she still owes on the mortgage .
It ’s a last ditch effort to make more money than you would in foreclosure .
As such , all short sales must receive third - party approval , meaning that any agreement reached between the buyer and the seller is analyzed by the bank to determine if the deal is more beneficial than simply seizing the property .
The process can take months and still not achieve bank approval .
The longer a property sits on the market , the more desperate the seller becomes .
The warning “ potential short sale ” is showing up in more and more listings as sellers drop their prices in an attempt to draw attention to their properties .
But from a buyer ’s perspective , entering into a short sale can feel like a risky prospect .
You might get a good deal out of it .
Or you might waste months that could have been spent looking for other houses only to learn that the bank did n’t approve the contract .
You could always try to renegotiate the offer , but the price might go up beyond your range , possibly exceeding your loan qualification .
Which brings us to home loans , the real crux of the housing problem .
At the peak of the housing bubble , with credit flowing free and easy , people were buying homes that they could n’t realistically afford thanks to mortgage gimmicks and no down payments .
Now that we ’re in the middle of a credit crunch , these low cost mortgages have all but disappeared and conventional loans are difficult to obtain .
It has become almost impossible to get a conventional mortgage without promising at least 10 percent of the sale price upfront , with many lenders requiring as much as 20 percent .
The average sale price for a Baltimore City home in January , 2009 was roughly $ 150,000 .
A conventional mortgage down payment would mean $ 30,000 in down payment .
If you have $ 30,000 , you can afford way more house than the one bedroom , one bath $ 150,000 can get you in Baltimore .
Conventional mortgages are simply not available to most homebuyers right now .
If you ca n’t guarantee that kind of money upfront , then your only likely option is an FHA loan .
FHA loans are great in that they only require a 3.5 percent down payment , but there are certain conditions that can become increasingly difficult to meet as more homes in your price range move into foreclosure .
To qualify for an FHA loan , the house you wish to purchase must be up to a certain standard of livable condition .
It has to have working , running water .
There ca n’t be any defective paint surfaces — significant peeling or damage to paint would lead to disqualification .
In a better market these smaller issues would n’t be such big problems ; a buyer could negotiate to have the seller make any necessary repairs before the contract was settled .
But with more homes being listed and sold “ as is , ” buyers have very little leverage in trying to bring properties up to code .
Most of the homes going into foreclosure have been empty and on the market for a long time .
Many were neglected by owners and simply fall into an increasing state of disrepair and the banks will do nothing to prevent or fix the damage .
I ’ve even heard stories about owners taking out their mortgage frustrations on their homes .
The properties go into foreclosure and instead of just leaving quietly , angry sellers rip down drywall , crack the pipes and take off with the kitchen sink .
Someone with renovation expertise could buy up these properties for very little and turn them into beautiful homes , but you ca n’t purchase this kind of place with an FHA loan , and who wants to put a ton of money down , plus a bunch toward renovation to turn it around and still have the property sit on the market for nearly a year ?
It ’s a pretty big risk to take at a time when it ’s least likely to pay off .
The housing market is simply not the buyers ’ playground that you might have imagined it to be .
Prices are falling but sales are n’t going up because the same conditions that are undesirable for sellers — foreclosures , short sales , empty homes depreciating the overall value of otherwise nice neighborhoods , frightened lenders — are n’t appealing for buyers either .
While it ’s true that most homebuyers in this market will be able to afford more house than they could have a few years ago ( or afford one at all , as is the case for my husband and me ) , it ’s not exactly a buffet of terrific options .
At least not for this young , first - time homebuyer .
There ’s some real potential in President Obama ’s new plan to shore up the housing market , and the $ 8000 homebuyer tax credit that just passed with the recent stimulus bill is definitely an added incentive to get out there and shop around .
I ’d like to tell sellers to be hopeful , that buyers are hungry and the market ca n’t get much worse than it is now .
But the truth is , it can and probably will .

Here is the growbox all put together .
I 've used Kleenex boxes duct taped to the side of the growbox to act as light traps .
The lighting heat is exhausted through dryer duct to the crack above the closet door .
Dryer duct is used to ventilate the box to the scrubber and then from the scrubber to above the closet door .
The ducting is just duct taped to the side to the box .
I leave a lot of slack in the dryer hose so I can take the top box off and set it aside .
This set up is very stealthy since the computer fans made virtually no noise and the fans are installed inside of the both the growbox and the filter .
The ventilation works all on negative pressure , so all the smelly air is filtered .
Technical Details :
Anyone can stick some lights in a box but it's up to the ventilation system to make it work right .
The basic rule for ventilation is that the intake area must be 2 x the exhaust area otherwise the air flow will be restricted .
The lighting chamber is cooled by a computer fan pushing about 38 CFM .
The exhaust air comes out at about 82 - 84 F , but there is little heat transferred to the grow chamber .
The lights run about 90 F inside the lighting chamber .
The grow area of the box is ventilated by the scrubber with about 10 - 15 CFM .
The air temperature exhausted is about 1 - 2 F above ambient .
The air exchange rate is optimal to provide fresh air to the plants while not stressing the plants out by drying from too much air flow .

Actor says that second film , if green - lit , " goes more in - depth " into legacy
Dragonball film actor Justin Chatwin ( Son Goku ) told SciFiNow , Imagine Publishing 's British science fiction , fantasy , and horror magazine , that his live - action project already has a script for a second film written .
Chatwin added that if the sequel is green - lit , " The second one goes more into the whole legacy and the genealogy of Dragonball .
It goes more in - depth into a real Dragonball series , the kind of intergalactic world of Dragonball . ”
This follows actress Jamie Chung 's recent statement that the actors had signed up for two sequels to the first movie .
James Wong and 20th Century Fox 's live - action film adaptation of Akira Toriyama 's Dragonball fighting manga will open in Japan on March 13 .
It will then open in the United Kingdom on April 3 and open in America on April 8 .
Unless you ’ve been living under a rock for the last several months , you ’re probably aware that there ’s this highly anticipated movie coming on March 6th called Watchmen .
However , unless you ’re a hardcore movie fan or comic fan , you might know nothing about the Watchmen .
It does n’t exactly have the widespread notoriety of Batman or Superman .
So here ’s a Cliff ’s Notes primer on the series and the movie .
To begin , you can watch a trailer here to familiarize yourself with the material .
From the mind of Zach Snyder , the man who directed 300 , comes this adaptation of a twelve - issue comic book created by Alan Moore .
Moore was also the creative force behind V for Vendetta and From Hell , both of which were later adapted into films .
Watchmen takes place in an alternate reality which closely mirrors the contemporary world of the 1980s .
For example , the United States is edging closer to a nuclear war with the Soviet Union , much like the real life Cold War .
The one major difference is the presence of superheroes .
Costumed vigilantes , think Batman or Spiderman but with different attire , roam the streets and fight crime .
Their impact is felt , but over time they grow unpopular among the public .
Eventually legislation is passed in 1977 to outlaw them altogether .
While many of the heroes retired , two of them , Doctor Manhattan and the Comedian , operate as government - sanctioned agents .
A third hero , Rorschach , continues to operate outside the law .
The plot kicks off with the murder of Edward Blake , the Comedian .
Police are unable to turn up any leads and Rorschach decides to probe further .
What he finds is a bit of a conspiracy theory , believing he has discovered a plot to eliminate the costumed adventurers .
In response , he sets about warning three of his retired comrades : the Nite Owl , the Silk Spectre , and Ozymandias , plus Doctor Manhattan .
Shortly thereafter many of them are set - up , which pulls them all out of retirement and eventually uncovers something much greater .
I wo n’t spoil anything more , you ’ll have to watch the movie or read the book to find out more .
The six principle characters are as follows :
The Comedian
Real Name : Edward Blake
Played in the Movie by : Jeffrey Dean Morgan
Skills and Equipment : Skilled in hand - to - hand combatant , proficient marksman , military veteran .
A long time vigilante , he had been active for over forty years , either on his own or through the aide of government - sponsored activities .
Basically , he is a cigar - chomping , gun-toting vigilante - turned - paramilitary agent .
He is known as a nihilist with little regard for morality or human life .
He sees the world as a sadistic joke only he understands .
You often see the Comedian wear a “ smiley - face ” button , hence its presence in movie advertisements .
At the beginning of the series , the button is smeared with a single drop of blood , which , if the button is viewed as a clock face , is at the position of the minute hand of the Doomsday Clock at the time of the series , five minutes to midnight .
Doctor Manhattan
Real Name : Dr. Jon Osterman
Played in the Movie by : Billy Crudup
Skills and Equipment : Superhuman strength , telekinesis , teleportation , control over matter at a subatomic level , clairvoyant .
The only character in Watchmen with actual superhuman powers after a nuclear physics experiment goes wrong .
Initially he is contracted by the United States government and marketed as a superhero .
However , he grows increasingly disinterested in human affairs and is unable to connect with others , especially his love interest , the Silk Spectre .
Eventually he rejects the validity of any notion of morality .
Something of a God - figure due to his near omniscient knowledge and almost omnipotent powers , he is also as flawed and human as the rest of the Watchmen .
Nite Owl
Real Name : Dan Dreiberg
Played in the Movie by : Patrick Wilson
Skills and Equipment : Technical wizardry along the lines of Batman .
Dan Dreiberg is actually the second Nite Owl .
The original Nite Owl , Hollis Mason , was his idol and when he retired , Dreiberg wrote to Mason , asking if he could carry on his name .
Mason accepted and the the two men became friends , meeting every Saturday .
Dreiberg is also friends with Rorschach , and partners with him from time to time .
Unlike many of the Watchmen , he is friendly , honest , and affable .
He was left a large inheritance , which he used to design and build his crime - fighting gear .
As you might guess , all of his gadgets and costumes are based on an owl theme .
Ozymandias
Real Name : Adrian Veidt
Played in the Movie by : Matthew Goode
Skills and Equipment :
One of the smartest men on the planet , intelligence leads to the exploitation of advanced technology and genetics , world - class athlete .
Adrian Veidt was formerly the superhero Ozymandias , who retired to devote his attention to the running of his own enterprises .
He draws inspiration from his hero Alexander the Great .
He is often accompanied by his genetically - engineered pet Bubastis .
A highly ambitious man , he is also a ruthless master strategist , swiftly eliminating anybody who dares to get in the way of his plans .
As a character , he is the polar opposite to Rorschach .
He is successful , good - looking , popular , and at the heart of society , not on the fringe .
Rorschach
Real Name : Walter Kovacs
Played in the Movie by : Jackie Earle Haley
Skills and Equipment : Blatantly ruthless , overwhelmingly strong , good at the use of improvised weapons , skilled at picking locks , a good detective , carries a grappling hook .
Rorschach is easily identified by the inkblot mask he wears to conceal his face .
It is also where he gets his name .
The mask contains two viscous liquids , one black and one white , which are held between two layers of latex .
The liquids continually shift in response to heat and pressure , forming symmetrical patterns like those of a Rorschach inkblot test .
He is the one man who continued to battle crime long after costumed vigilantes became both detested and illegal .
He does this because he has a moral absolutism , where good and evil are clearly defined and evil must be violently punished .
These beliefs and their pursuit have alienated him from the rest of society .
Politically , he is an extremely right - wing character .
He is an anti-communist , anti-liberal , reactionary , and a strong nationalist .
I guess he would n’t have voted for Obama .
Silk Spectre
Real Name : Laurie Juspeczyk
Played in the Movie by : Malin Akerman
Skills and Equipment : Athlete - level strength , gymnast - like skills , great fighting prowess .
Like the Nite Owl , Laurie Juspeczyk is not the original Silk Spectre .
She is the daughter of Sally Jupiter , the first Silk Spectre ( played by Carla Gugino in the movie ) .
Sally fought crime for years and wanted her daughter to follow in her footsteps .
Not enthusiastic to the idea , she followed anyway , which would lead to her becoming romantically involved with Dr. Manhattan .
That is something her mother did not approve of as she likened it to sleeping withan H - bomb .
Because of her relationship with the Doctor , she is kept on retainer by the government .
Never exactly happy being a vigilante , nor happy with the government taking advantage of her relationship , she was more than pleased to quit being a superhero when they were banned .
Eventually her relationship with Dr. Manhattan becomes strained as he grows distant with her .
So there ’s your brief rundown of the characters and the basic storyline .
If you are interested in finding our more , you can wait for the film or check out the books right now .
A few days ago I was reading a book called “ Empire ” by Orson Scott Card .
It was a frightening book — albiet unrealistic — of what happened if there was a civil war between left wing hi-tech lunatics and hardcore rightwing survivalists .
That premise , I felt , was n’t very realistic .
But a part of the book dealt with a series of lectures that I found the idea of both fascinating and appalling — the fall of America .
I will summarize the main salient points .
While an avid reader of history , I am not a historian and would appreciate corrections being made .
Rome was founded as an aristocratically lead nation in the hills of Italy .
At some point , they turned into a republic , where citizens were represented by their Senate .
This representation was not very absolute — the needs of the common people were often over looked — but there WAS attempts ( the plebian tribunes , the land reforms of the Grachii ) at making sure government was … well , representative .
Rome grew in power and size , and her bureaucacy swelled .
Increasingly , the republic was beset with internal problems and external issues .
Increasingly , the Senate became filled with corrupt senators in the pay and bidding of the Legions , or local businessmen , or corrupt smugglers — one senator was even paid by pirates !
As a result of the increasing corruption and wasting of money , taxes became ever more onerous , and elections were mob affairs — canidates murdered in the streets .
The upstanding were butchered , like Cicero , and the base and venal were hailed as heroes .
Eventually , there was very little left .
A long string of ineffective Senate leaders culminated in allowing a few powerful men — Caesar , Pompey , Crassius — to take most control of the Republic .
The three plotted to rule jointly , then turned on one another .
Caesar ?
won and began using his absolute power to try to derail the Republic .
He failed — a patriot named Brutus and the rest of the Senate saw to that — but that did not stop the fall .
Octavian , a strong man and a cunning one , played to the mob and the business leaders , and before long the proud history of the Republic was ashes , the Senate little more than a rubber stamp , the people ’s rights thrown to the ground and replaced with bread and circuses .
Compare .
America started as an aristocratically lead society , with the powerful and influential leading the people to revolt against tyranny .
These leaders , much like the ancient Roman founders of the Republic , tried to create a government that was fair .
They paid much more attention to givng power to the people , to stopping tyranny , and almost none to making themselves powerful — they were , without a doubt , great men and human beings .
But they were all too mortal , and they died , and much like Rome , less able men took their place , and as the country prospered , interests found reasons to chip away at the structure .
Just as the practice in Rome of allowing outlying regions to govern their own affairs lead to outlying corruption , so did in the early years the nation struggle with corruption on a state level , with Tammany Hall a symbol of everything wrong with government .
Much like Rome swelled and grew fat on the conquest and expansion , so did America expand , until we held islands in the Atlantic and Pacific , armies flung all over the world ( Legion style ) , and interfering with every nation within our reach .
Like Rome , our government has become more corrupt , more attuned to listening to big business than to the small man , the plebian , the everyday Joe .
Like Rome , the very offiicials elected to protect us from corruption are often found themselves to be corrupted , like Mr. Spitzer .
Like Rome , we are engaged in a seemingly unending series of small wars that serve mostly to antagonize those around us and drain our wealth and treasure — yet fatten the pockets of the military industrial complex .
( Roman arms manufacturers and the armorers who made segmenta lorica , the Legionary armor , had more sway in the Senate than entire segments of Rome ) .
Like Rome , the government defines new roles for itself on a regular basis — with no limits or checks .
Like Rome , the government panders to the mob , saying what they think they wish to hear and doing little .
It matters not if it ’s a mob in ancient Rome baying for free bread , taxes on big landowners , and to fling the Germans out , or if it ’s a mob in America baying for more welfare , taxes on big businesses , and to fling the illegal aliens out .
Like Rome , we have become paralyzed to fix anything .
Here ’s one that should please the Ron Paul supporters : he had an ancient predecessor , the Brothers Grachii , who advocated increased participation in the Senate by the people , more protections for the people ’s rights to own land and property , less restrictions on the people ’s travel , the right for redress against patricians , land reform ( the equivilent , really of money reform back then ) , and smaller government .
Rome , of course , was a lot more hardcore than America .
They murdered the elder , and then the younger brother , in shockingly gruesome fashion .
That was the end of the Brother Gratchi Revolution .
Not long after , a series of strongmen like Pompey and Sulla ( Bush , anyone ) ran the country , running over the rights of everyone , engaging in petty wars , running up debts .
( Some say that Sulla did good things .
Some people think Bush is a good president , too .
Your miliage may vary ) .
And then ?
The collapse , the fall , the Republic replaced with an Empire , starting so slowly that by the time it was done , everyone had already become complicit in it .
Is America showing parallels to Rome , in the last days of the Republic ?
If the economy goes to pieces , and terrorism becomes so rampant that we live in terror , if the population feels powerless and impotent , if the government is so steeped in corruption that it can accomplish nothing but spend more money than it can take in , and take in so much money it bankrupts businesses and drives them away … do you * really * think the average person of this country would not accept a strong , cunning leader ?
A leader that might suspend some “ rights ” in the name of security ?
Bush has only started .
A leader that might put a government stranglehold on the economy to “ save it ” ?
Enough people are in credit and financial trouble that they would n’t care .
A leader who would manipulate the press ?
Or create an educational system so inefficiently run that any change would seem positive , even if it ended up brainwashing children into adoration of the “ leader ” ?
If you think it cannot happen … maybe you should read your history some more .
Stem cells have been linked with cancer in animals A boy treated with foetal stem cells for a rare genetic disease has developed benign tumours , raising questions about the therapy 's safety .
The boy , now 17 , received the stem cells in 2001 at a Moscow hospital and four years later scans showed brain and spinal tumours , PLoS Medicine reports .
Israeli doctors removed the abnormal growth from his spine and tests suggest it sprouted from the stem cells .
Critics say the finding is evidence against the controversial therapy .
Apart from the ethics of using cells taken from embryos , opponents say there are big safety concerns .
As well as the possibility that stem cells may turn cancerous , some researchers fear that it is possible that stem cell therapy could unwittingly pass viruses and other disease causing agents to people who receive cell transplants .
Experimental therapy Experts are hopeful that stem cells , which have the ability to develop into other kinds of human cells , will eventually lead to treatments for some of the most intractable conditions .
Although this is just one case it does show that we need to be careful
Stem cell scientist Dr Stephen Minger
The boy in question was treated for a condition called Ataxia Telangiectasia - a genetic disease that attacks the brain region controlling movement and speech .
He received three courses of foetal stem cell injections to the brain and the fluid surrounding the spine .
Four years after his first injection he was investigated for recurrent headaches and his doctors at the Sheba Medical Centre in Tel Aviv found two tumours - one in the spine and one in the brain at the same sites the injections had been given .
A year later , when the boy was 14 , the doctors removed the non-cancerous tumour from his spine and it was found to contain cells that could not have arisen from the patient 's own tissue and had in all probability grown from the donated stem cells .
Although they were unable to sample the growth in the boy 's brain , the scientists believe this probably arose from the injected stem cells too .
Donor - derived cells might have been able to spark tumours in this patient because people with Ataxia Telangiectasia often have a weakened immune system , say the researchers .
It is not clear whether the stem cell therapy helped his genetic condition .
Safety fears
They say the findings " do not imply that the research in stem cell therapeutics should be abandoned . "
Nonetheless , they say more work should be done to assess the safety of this therapy .
Josephine Quintavalle of the public interest group Comment on Reproductive Ethics said : " The risks of tumour formation in association with embryonic stem cells are widely acknowledged and one reason why there are very serious concerns about the proposed use of such cells in treating spinal cord injury in the US .
" It would appear from this report that foetal stem cells are similarly unstable .
These are not areas of therapy we should be rushing into , whatever the ethical debates surrounding the use of embryo or foetal tissue per se . "
Stem cell scientist Dr Stephen Minger , of King 's College London , said it was clear that the tumours had arisen from the transplanted cells .
" This is worrying and we have to be cautious .
We need to have long term monitoring and follow up of the patients given stem cells and rigorous regulation of centres providing cell therapy .
" Although this is just one case it does show that we need to be careful about the cell populations we are using . "
He said not all clinics used good quality cells .

Some very smart , very serious people have been spending a lot of time lately working themselves into a tizzy trying to defend their ongoing romance with the Governor of Alaska .
“ Okay , ” they seem willing to admit , “ Palin might be a little weak on foreign policy , domestic policy , energy policy , financial policy , the economy in general , the fundamental workings of the state and federal government , geography , rhetoric , history and basic grammar , but these are just gaps in her knowledge , easily fixable by a spending a few hours in front of Wikipedia or flipping through flash cards .
They do n’t in any way cast doubt in some fundamental way on her intellect or character . ”
This is such a bizarre and indefensible thesis that one almost feels bad responding to it , as one would the taunts of children or the developmentally disabled .
I had hoped that as the election subsided the Governor ’s defenders would shrink away chagrined , the bitter morning light revealing the object of their affaire de coeur a false Aphrodite , her nails pasties and her luxurious hair a weave .
But the choruses of “ Palin 2012 ” have not abated and thus it becomes necessary to dispense with this whole “ Palin is smart but untutored ” meme once and for all .
First , Gov. Palin may be young for a politician but she is not in fact actually young .
Forty - four is a lot of years to have spent walking the earth without having learned all the countries involved in the North American Free Trade Agreement ( there are three , and she ’s a governor for one of them . )
The suggestion that she ’s some sort of prodigy who just has n’t been exposed to basic civic information is absurd .
If this woman were anywhere near sharp enough to be put in charge of any major undertaking she would have picked up this information solely by osmosis after nearly a half - century .
There is also the assumption that all of these nuanced policy - related questions are somehow out of her bailiwick , as if someone sprinted up to her and demanded in - depth information about how to caulk a faucet or snake a drain .
But Palin is n’t ignorant as compared with say , the head of the CIA or the Secretary of Education — she seems to lack fundamental knowledge about basic information .
Her inability to name a Supreme Court decision in the Couric interview , or obviously the whole is - Africa - a - continent thing — this is n’t like being unsure of the sub-chairmen of the Pakistani senate .
Any reasonably intelligent individual , interested in the workings of the society in which they operate and the world in which they reside would have been able to pick most of this stuff up .
To return to the previous analogy for a moment , this is the equivalent of expecting her to know that excrement goes in the toilet and not the sink — you do n’t exactly need to be Joe the Plumber to have hashed that one out .
All this , of course , is putting aside the obvious truth that she is not only a politician but also an elected official , and thus expected to be capable of coherent speech about politics in general and the government that she serves in particular .
The entire purpose of a representative democracy is that the people elect an individual of appropriate intellect and character who is ( or at least becomes ) an expert on the issues they face .
Her ignorance therefore of political issues represents not simply a disturbing lack of intellectual curiosity for the executive of a state but an actual failure on her part to faithfully discharge the duties of her office .
Against these varied and reasonable objections her defenders can offer little .
At best they mistake charisma for intellect , at worst they rant endlessly about elitism , as if only latte - sipping New York theater critics consider being able to present one ’s thoughts coherently a prerequisite of leadership .
If possible they prefer not to enter into the debate at all , fiating simply that by virtue of having obtained her post she must be an individual of substantive intellectual standing .
This is a cheap form of argumentum ad populum , and its introduction into the debate is sophistry .
I have no idea why the citizens of Alaska elected this woman governor — likely they intuited she was n’t exactly the reincarnation of Isaac Newton but felt her sufficiently equipped to cut them their oil money check .
Mass democracy is a poor method of assigning merit .
Hitler was elected chancellor .
The people of Washington , DC elected Marion Barry governor ( twice ) .
One does not accept consensus opinion over the reporting of one ’s senses and the judgments of objective reason .
It is understandable that people like Gov. Palin ; she 's quite likable .
I kind of like her .
But it 's unreasonable not to recognize that the qualities one finds attractive in Palin are not the qualities that would serve the country in good stead as a national politician .
Foremost amongst those traits not in the meaty section of the Venn Diagram between “ Successful Leaders ” and “ Sarah Palin ” is the ability to process and synthesize raw information .
While it is true in the abstract that intellect and knowledge are not identical , in practice they are two horses that generally pull in the same harness .
Ignorant people tend to be stupid , and stupid people tend to be ignorant .
In my mind , any reasonable observer watching Palin ’s performance since entering the national stage would have to conclude that she is both .

ExxonMobil continues to stand steadfast against including LGBT people in their non discrimination policy .
Mobil had such a policy which was reversed when Exxon Corp merged with them .
The shareholders refuse to acknowledge LGBT people and have consistently voted down a proposal for an inclusive non-discrimination policy .
This year shareholder support for adding LGBT protections to the non-discrimination policy went down by a whopping 18 percent .
In total 78 % of Exxonmobil shareholders are opposed to adding sexual orientation and gender identity / expression to their policy .
It is imperative that we continue to let them know of our concern as well as to ensure a community wide boycott .

MILWAUKEE —
For a few deeply unpleasant days , the Rev. David Cooper found himself in the crosshairs of the Roman Catholic hierarchy .
It was 2003 , and the priest had opined to a reporter that women should be ordained .
Faraway bishops rumbled about censure .
Then he picked up the telephone and heard the baritone of Milwaukee ’s archbishop , Timothy M. Dolan .
Father Cooper immediately offered to resign .
No , no , the archbishop replied , we just need to repair the damage .
“ He was very pastoral and caring , ” Father Cooper recalled .
And how was it resolved ?
“ Oh , I agreed to recant , ” he said .
“ He effectively silenced me . ”
Archbishop Dolan , whom Pope Benedict XVI named on Monday to lead the Archdiocese of New York , is a genial enforcer of Rome ’s ever more conservative writ , a Falstaffian fellow who talks of his love of the Brewers baseball team and Miller beer , and who takes obvious joy in donning his bishop ’s robes and pounding his bishop ’s staff as he tromps into church .
When talking with parishioners , he places his hand on their shoulders , sidles in close and , out of the corner of his mouth , cracks a joke .

The film , announced by Variety today , will begin as a traditional costume drama , only to alarmingly shift in tone when an alien crash lands and begins to kill the stuffy protagonists .
If the project was n't bizarre sounding enough , flamboyant pop icon Elton John will also be on both production duties ( through his Rocket Productions ) and will be writing the music .
First - timer Will Clark will direct , whilst John 's partner David Furnish will also produce .
He said : " It felt like a fresh and funny way to blow apart the done - to - death Jane Austen genre by literally dropping this alien into the middle of a costume drama , where he stalks and slashes to horrific effect . "

Twenty - three years after
On the Origin of Species was published , its author was given a de facto state funeral in Westminster Abbey .
Establishment opinion was no longer scandalised by his supposedly most scandalous of theories .
In his authoritative study of how in Darwinism was received in the US and UK in the 19th century , James Moore observes that " with but few exceptions the leading Christian thinkers in Great Britain and America came to terms quite readily with Darwinism and evolution . "
It was a different story at the popular level .
The general public never accepted the theory as readily as intellectuals did , in large part because it often encountered evolution as a social rather than scientific theory .
Social Darwinism argued that might was right , and that to protect the weak and vulnerable was to defy nature .
Only the fittest should survive .
Understandably , this doctrine had limited appeal for those deemed weak or unfit , and helped fuel anti-evolutionary sentiment in the early 20th century , particularly in America where Social Darwinism was more influential .
A similar thing seems to be happening today .
According to a Theos / ComRes research study , the initial findings of which are published today , over half of Britons are sceptical about Darwinian evolution .
Rather than slotting people into predetermined categories on the basis of a single question ( as previous research in UK has tended to do ) , this study asked over 2,000 respondents their opinions of evolution , intelligent design ( ID ) and creationism , in a number of different questions , comparing and scrutinising their answers to ascertain the level of people 's conviction and coherence .
The results revealed opinions that were rather more complex and confused than had been previously thought .
Roughly a quarter of people were consistent and convinced Darwinians , while slightly fewer were equally consistent and convinced opponents ( split between " young earth " creationism and ID ) .
The remaining 50 % were somewhere between , mixing different ideas and showing a distinct inclination to hedge their bets .
Darwinian evolution is probably true … but , then , so is ID .
Those who actively reject evolution do so for predictable reasons .
Some genuinely believe evolution is scientifically flawed , others think it contradicts their sacred text .
But most people do not actively reject evolution – they are simply sceptical about it .
And the reason for their scepticism appears to lie in the fact that too many encounter Darwinism not as an elegant , parsimonious and well - evidenced scientific theory , but as a quasi- metaphysical one , an outlook on life that has become inextricably linked , through the purple prose of its most eloquent modern proponents , with reductionism , nihilism , atheism , and amorality .
According to this understanding of Darwinism , morality ( in as far as we can still talk about it ) becomes calculating and fundamentally self - interested , ethical systems arbitrary , agency an illusion , human beings accidental and irrelevant , the human mind " a habitat for memes " , the universe no more than " blind forces and physical replication " , and God a nonsense .
This was not Darwin 's understanding of evolution and it need not be ours .
Evolution is perfectly compatible with belief in God , in human uniqueness , and with absolute morality .
Indeed , as our understanding of convergence – " the recurrent tendency of biological organisation to arrive at the same ' solution ' to a particular need " – deepens , it becomes clear that evolution is not even incompatible with ideas of design and purpose .
The bad news is that , just as a century ago when popular opinion met evolution in the guise of socio-political doctrine and often rejected it , today popular opinion is encountering it in a quasi- philosophical guise , and similarly turning away .
The good news is that the problem is entirely solvable .
Our modern vision of a bleak , pitiless metaphysical Darwinism is no more authentic than Herbert Spencer 's bleak , pitiless Social Darwinism .
Darwinism can be rescued from a philosophical quagmire that Darwin himself always sought to avoid .

U.S. Airways Flight 1549 : Cockpit Audio Tape
The cockpit conversation between U.S. Airways Flight 1549 pilotand the LaGuardia air traffic controllers was released today .
The ATC taped conversation leading up to the miraculous Hudson River landing was a decidedly calm exchange , as evidenced by the audio below .
The pilot calmly told the LaGuardia tower , " we 're going to be in the Hudson " , referring to the Airbus A320 that carried 155 passengers and crew .
Thus the water rescue began , an amazing story of survival that was made possible because of the quick thinking and actions of the pilot and crew of Flight 1549 .

Fail and You Kids these days .
Used to be , when you were mad at your parents or your professors , you 'd write an email worm in Visual Basic and spread it around via Outlook clients .
Hacks like that did n't take a lot of talent , but they had some comic value .
As a tech person , it 's entertaining to watch someone who 's not savvy work a machine that they think is " infected with a virus . "
The more industrious evildoers wrote self - propagating worms that exploited vulnerabilities in common services , like the SQL Slammer worm that slowed internet traffic to a crawl on a Friday night when I was in college .
Many of us nerds had to go outside and party instead of playing video games until 4AM .
I know of several pregnancies that were a direct result of this vulnerability in Microsoft SQL Server .
Hell , even Hacked by Chinese was funny because it was so prolific .
But this generation 's biggest accomplishment thus far is last week 's hack on Twitter .
After guessing the password to an administrative account with a dictionary attack , one hacker started handing out account credentials .
Barack Obama , Britney Spears , Fox News , and several others were compromised , and the evildoers went so far as to post some fake messages to these accounts .
Ph33r .
As a result , there 's been no shortage of criticism for Twitter .
Not having implemented any rate - limiting for login attempts , they kind of had this coming .
As a pundit , though , I can tell you that making fun of Twitter 's feeble attempt at engineering is pointless .
Yes , Twitter failed , but that joke is old .
What 's far better ?
The collateral failure of the hackers and the media .
The hero of our story , an anonymous leet haxor , figured out that you could use curl and a text file of words to launch a dictionary attack against a web login form .
This technique is far less advanced than the methods of yore : finding improper usage of strcpy and the like , coming up with executable shellcode , and figuring out the function return address memory offset .
Back in the day , that shit was hard , so good hacks were generally reserved for people who really knew what they were doing .
Incidentally , people who knew what they were doing usually had a plan for what to do after the hack was successful .
What happened to the next iteration of hackers ?
I blame generational pussification - things like the everybody - is - a - winner attitude and Coldplay are making our children soft .
As the Twitter invader proves , it does n't take much to be a " hacker " these days .
Great fuckin ' job , Mitnick .
Give a kid a good asskicking and make him listen to Frank Zappa .
He 'll be able to dissect a stack frame .
Perhaps there 's some leeway here : Twitter ai n't exactly fortified .
If you 're going to impersonate Twitter users , come up with some better shit than posting “ Breaking : Bill O Riley is gay ” to the Fox News stream , and at least learn how to spell .
You can impersonate the President - elect of the United States and the best you can do is " get a free gas card " ?
You can impersonate Britney Spears , and you tell us how her vagina has razor - sharp teeth ?
OK , that one was pretty inventive , but overall , fucking fail .

The police officer who was infamously caught on camera tackling a bicyclist in New York City was fired on February 10th , seven months after the original incident .
[ social_buttons ]
As we reported here on Planetsave , former officer Patrick Pogan , 23 , has been arraigned under charges of falsifying records .
We ’ve now learned that he has plead not guilty to the charges in Manhattan court and could face up to 4 years in prison if convicted .
The Manhattan District Attorney said that the YouTube video footage along with witness accounts clearly contradicted Pogan ’s claim that the cyclist was “ obstructing government administration ” and resisting arrest .
The cyclist had charges dropped soon after the video became available .
Pogan was a rookie officer and he has still not given a legitimate explanation as to why he tackled the cyclist .
We have learned that he was an offensive lineman on his high school football team — perhaps that could explain a bit ?
The power of YouTube footage also came in handy recently with the case of a teenage boy who decided to upload footage of himself torturing a cat .
Once the video spread , people from various message boards and social media websites traced the boy ’s name and location , eventually resulting in his arrest .
He and his brother , who filmed the abuse , have been charged with two counts of animal cruelty .
If you ’re not one of the 2 million people who have seen the footage of the cyclist tackle , check it out below .
[ youtube=http://www.youtube.com/v/oUkiyBVytRQ&hl=en&fs=1]
UPDATE : The New York Times is reporting that Pogan ’s lawyer claims that Pogan “ resigned ” from the force and was not fired , contrary to the statement released by the police department .
Also , I ’ve made a small correction — it has only been about 7 months since the incident , not over 18 months .
Silly me , I ’ll have to use a calculator next time I try such a tricky math problem late at night .

BBC Middle East Editor Jeremy Bowen 's diary of the conflict between Hamas and Israel .
Gaza 's schools suffered heavy damage during the conflict
24 JANUARY
The first day back at school is always a rush for children and parents .
Even if you 're organised there 's always an exercise book , or bag , or a pair of swimming goggles that has disappeared during the break .
Normally you can sort it out in a few minutes of frantic activity , and then the children get off to school , and peace descends again - for a few hours anyway .
So imagine what it was like to be a 10 - year - old girl called Mona in Gaza .
Her school reopened Saturday morning , after the break for the war .
She does n't have parents to get her off to school , as they were killed by Israeli soldiers .
Her brother took her back to their family house this morning , to find her school things .
Schoolbooks left behind The Israeli soldiers who occupied her house pulled everything out of her cupboard .
They smashed up the stone floor to get at the sand underneath to fill their sandbags .
Mona 's clothes and school books were in a tangle on the ground with the sand , discarded ration packs , and bits of tile .
Mona lost both her parents during the Israeli operation
She rummaged around , pulling out books for her English course , and her dark green school smock .
I asked her why she thought the Israelis had come into her life .
She said that it was because they wanted peace to be for them , not for Palestinians .
And I asked her what her mother would say if she saw her bedroom in such a state .
Mona said she'd be furious .
In the end she decided to leave the schoolbooks behind and she carried the green smock under her arm .
It was grubby and creased , so she did n't want to wear it .
Mona is a bright little girl , and she knows what has happened to her .
She carries a pad of paper , and draws constantly .
So do my children , but they draw pictures that show them playing in the garden , and having fun at parties , or on holiday .
Mona did two versions of the drawing that is most on her mind at the moment .
It shows an aircraft firing missiles , soldiers , tanks , bulldozers knocking down buildings , and in the middle of it all is a house full of tiny stick figures .
They are Mona and her family .
Another picture shows her trying to help her mother and her father .
But any feeling of normality here or anywhere else in Gaza at the moment is an illusion
Probably because she was with a TV crew , Mona was a little late for school .
Only a caretaker was there .
He said that classes had been transferred to another building about a mile away .
The reason was that the school was no place for children .
It had been badly shot up , and parts of it were burnt out .
Mona wanted to see her classroom .
It was a wreck .
The playground was bleak , and empty .
Judging by the marks they had left behind in the sandy soil , tanks had driven up to playground wall and crushed it .
The other school looked more normal .
I could not see any bullet holes , and it was full of noisy children .
But any feeling of normality here or anywhere else in Gaza at the moment is an illusion .
A psychologist was at the school to talk to the children about what they had seen and suffered .
She said she had to start with the teaching staff , because they were finding it difficult to function .
One of the teachers told me it was very hard to help the children through this terrible time when her own house had been destroyed .
' Punishment shootings '
The most shocking day of the war , the psychologist said , was the first .
It started on a Saturday , which is a school day .
The children she said were panicking .
Most of the younger ones wet themselves .
They had no idea how they were going to get home .
I ask all the Palestinian adults I meet here if they blame Hamas for their troubles .
Israeli spokespeople have said many times that Hamas has taken the people of Gaza hostage , and Israel hopes it can separate Hamas from the people .
Many people in Gaza do n't much like Hamas .
They are ruthless with their internal rivals .
Mona 's best friend was very pleased to see her , because she had heard that she was dead
The BBC is investigating well - founded reports that Hamas has been carrying out punishment shootings , mostly non-fatal but crippling , of several dozen people who support Fatah , the other main Palestinian faction .
Hamas does not promote free speech .
But one man I met summed up the mood of the people to whom I have been speaking .
He said that even if Hamas was attacking Israel , then the Israeli armed forces had no right to do what they have done to Palestinian civilians .
At the school Mona 's best friend was very pleased to see her , because she had heard that she was dead .
She held her hand and played with her fingers while Mona was talking to the teacher , whose eyes filled with tears when she saw her , because she also thought she had been killed .
She hurried away to the staff room afterwards .
I suppose she thought it would not be good for her class to see her break down .
Mona did not put on her green school smock .
I noticed how the other girls ' smocks were fresh and nicely ironed and their hair was tied back with new white ribbons .
I 'm sure her aunts in the extended family of which she is a much - loved part will make sure that Mona has what she needs the next time she goes to school .
She told me that she would still work hard , do her homework and live her life .
But without any of the self - pity an adult might be forgiven for showing , Mona told me that without her parents half the future was missing .

At first , when PETA offered Michael Vick a chance to star in a PSA against dog fighting , he jumped at the opportunity , probably hoping it would help clear his name .
[ social_buttons ]
But now , PETA is having second thoughts — saying they want him to take psychological tests and receive an MRI to show he ’s physically capable of having compassion for animals — party because of Vick ’s performance in a handwritten test on animal empathy .
Of course , they ’ve kindly released his answers to the public .

Some are downright hilarious ( “ Chickens have an uncanny ability to think and are very agile .
They are very athletic to me . ” ) while others actually make me feel bad for the guy ( “ Practice what you preech + do n’t condone in hyp . ” ) .
Based on the test alone , it ’s unclear whether Vick actually is “ reformed , ” so I do n’t blame PETA for holding off on the PSA deal .
His answers sound much like a 6th grade student rephrasing sentences from a text book for a take - home essay .
He ’s just saying what they wanted to hear .
Vick already has a universal bad rap — dog fighting is n’t a controversial topic , it ’s already been decided to be unethical by the vast majority of society .
There ’s really no reason for PETA to even try to help him as he ’s the only one who would benefit from this situation .
What do you think ?
Should PETA even bother fighting this battle ?

Mosquito Survives In Outer Space
by Alexander Peslyak
RIA Novosti commentator
Moscow ( RIA ) Feb 20 , 2009
Preparations are underway for a manned mission to Mars .
Cosmonauts who might fly to the Red Planet are learning how to survive in a forest outside Moscow .
Scientists from the Russian Academy of Sciences ' Institute of Medical and Biological Problems are assessing the impact of cosmic radiation on living organisms , one of which even managed to survive in outer space .
Anatoly Grigoryev , vice president of the Russian Academy of Sciences , told RIA Novosti that a mosquito had managed to survive in outer space .
First , it appeared that Grigoryev was talking about a spider running loose aboard the International Space Station .
Incredibly , a mosquito slept for 18 months on the outer ISS surface .
" We brought him back to Earth .
He is alive , and his feet are moving , " Grigoryev said .
The mosquito did not get any food and was subjected to extreme temperatures ranging from minus 150 degrees Celsius in the shade to plus 60 degrees in the sunlight .
Grigoryev said the insect had been taken outside the ISS on orders from the Institute 's scientists working on the Biorisk experiment .
" First , they studied bacteria and fungi till a Japanese scientist suggested studying mosquitoes , " Grigoryev told RIA Novosti .
Since 2005 , the Institute has been cooperating with two Japanese institutes under a grant and has been studying biological objects with preset properties , including barley and peas with high genetic resistance .
" Professor Takashi Okuda from the National Institute of Agro-Biological Science drew our attention to the unique , although short - lived , African mosquito ( bloodworm ) , whose larvae develop only in a humid environment , " Grigoryev said .
Rains are rare in Africa , where puddles dry up before one 's eyes .
However , this mosquito is well - adapted to adverse local conditions , existing in a state of suspended animation when vital bodily functions stop almost completely .
When suspended animation sets in , water molecules are replaced by tricallosa sugar , which leads to natural crystallization .
The larvae were then sprayed with acetone , boiled and cooled down to minus 210 degrees Celsius , the temperature of liquid nitrogen .
Amazingly , they survived all these hardships .
The Japanese also studied bloodworm DNA and found that it could be switched on and deactivated in 30 to 40 minutes .
" This is facilitated by the crystallization of biological matter , " Doctor of Biology Vladimir Sychev from the Institute of Medical and Biological Problems told RIA Novosti .
Dr. Sychev said scientists were interested in this mechanism , which makes it possible to assess the potential of living organisms subjected to multiple loads in outer space .
He said plant studies had made headway , but that living organisms were affected by gravitation , radiation and temperature fluctuations .
In the summer of 2007 , Russian cosmonauts Fyodor Yurchikhin and Oleg Kotov placed a gray cylinder with 24 cups containing barley seeds , bacteria , crustaceans ( Dafnia Magna ) , bloodworm larvae and other biological objects , on the outer ISS surface .
More than a year later , cosmonauts Sergei Volkov and Oleg Kononenko removed the cylinder and returned it to Earth .
The unique Biorisk experiment made it possible to study the impact of vacuum , subzero and hot temperatures and radiation on biological objects .
It is impossible to simulate these processes , Dr. Sychev stressed .
He said scientists were planning to send a number of microorganisms to Phobos , one of the Mars moons , under the Phobos - Grunt program , and to return them to Earth .
This will make it possible to assess their survival and reversible suspended - animation mechanisms .
Dr. Sychev also discussed various findings of the Biorisk project .
First , it appears that panspermia , the hypothesis that " seeds " of life already exist all over the Universe , that life on Earth may have originated through these " seeds , " and that they may deliver or have delivered life to other habitable bodies , is quite plausible .
Second , it is becoming possible to choose various methods and options for placing biological objects in a state of suspended animation and transporting them on long - duration space missions .
An interplanetary Noah's Ark would probably contain crystallized animals and other living organisms , thereby reducing feeding costs .
Although this is still in the realm of science fiction , researchers are currently preparing to sum up Russian and Japanese findings .

Favourite role : Patrick McGoohan in the 1959 BBC production of Ibsen 's Brand
The Prisoner star Patrick McGoohan , who has died aged 80 , was one of the leading British television stars of the 1950s and 1960s .
Born in New York , McGoohan was only a few months old when his immigrant parents returned to Ireland with him .
When he was eight , the family moved again , this time to Sheffield .
He left school with full intentions of fulfilling his mother 's ambition for him to become a priest .
But in 1948 , during a temporary stint working as a stage manager at the Sheffield Repertory , McGoohan realised he was destined to tread the boards .
He quickly became one of its leading actors , appearing in more than 200 plays over the following four years .
With more repertory work taking him to Coventry and Bristol , McGoohan eventually moved to London .
Controversial issues Danger Man was a big hit in the US under the title Secret Agent
It was here that he finally became a priest - on stage .
He starred in a 1955 West End production of the play Serious Charge , which stirred controversial issues when his character was accused of homosexuality .
Orson Welles was certainly impressed and subsequently cast him as Starbuck in his production of Moby Dick Rehearsed .
McGoohan then moved into films , and as a signed contract player for the Rank Organisation .
They cast him mostly playing heavies .
Through gritty films such as Hell Drivers , he perfected his bad boy persona on screen and began to make a name for himself .
McGoohan eventually fell out with Rank and turned to television .
Ibsen 's Brand became his favourite role and subsequently won him an award for best TV actor of the year .
It led him to the ITV series Danger Man , in which he played the lead role as spy John Drake .
No romantic scripts
By now , McGoohan had acquired the reputation of being a reclusive , sometimes difficult actor , and he stipulated that his scripts must not include any romantic involvements .
The Prisoner 's final episode baffled many viewers Drake also was not to carry a gun and throughout the first year of the series , he never killed anyone .
But the show still became highly successful in several countries , and after leaving to work on other projects , McGoohan later returned to do three more series .
Its successor , The Prisoner , produced by McGoohan himself and filmed in north Wales in 1967 and 1968 revolved around the efforts of a secret agent , who resigned early in his career , to clear his name .
His aim was to escape from a beautiful but psychologically brutal prison for people who know too much .
The series is remembered for the line : " I am not a number , I am a free man ! "
By the time the series ended , McGoohan was also contributing to the writing and directing of the series , which many critics found too philosophical and difficult for the average viewer to understand .
Nevertheless , like Danger Man it became a telelvision classic , and was still being shown around the world decades later .
Mysterious final episode
The series was as popular as it was surreal and the mysterious final episode - part of which featured no dialogue and was left deliberately ambiguous - was so controversial that McGoohan and his family left the UK for more than 20 years and seek relative anonymity in the USA .
His move to California led to appearances in a number of films , including Ice Station Zebra , and opposite Clint Eastwood in Escape from Alcatraz .
He also worked as an actor , director and writer on the hit 1970s TV series Columbo , which won him two Emmy awards .
McGoohan stayed out of the limelight in later years
To a later generation of fans , McGoohan became more recognised for his role as King Longshanks in Mel Gibson 's 1995 production of Braveheart and , over the years , McGoohan made infrequent return visits to Britain to make television films .
He was offered prestigious roles in both Harry Potter , as Dumbledore , and the Lord of the Rings trilogy , as Gandalf , but was forced to turn them down because of ill health .
McGoohan lived his last days in virtual retirement , living in Los Angeles with his wife of over 50 years , Joan Drummond McGoohan , whom he met and fell in love with back at the Sheffield Repertory .
Their marriage took place between a rehearsal and evening performance of The Taming of the Shrew , a production they were both cast in .
They had three daughters , Catherine , Anne and Frances .
Catherine and Anne both followed his footsteps into acting .

( CNN ) -- Top Republican lawmakers Sunday called on President Obama to change his political strategy , arguing that the passage of a massive stimulus bill on a party - line vote showed he has failed to deliver the " change " he promised .
Sen .
John McCain says the Obama administration is off to a " bad beginning . "
" If this is going to be bipartisanship , the country 's screwed , " Sen .
Lindsey Graham , R - South Carolina , told ABC's " This Week . "
" I know bipartisanship when I see it . "
Sen . John McCain , R - Arizona , said Obama was off to " a bad beginning , " out of step with the vow of bipartisanship both men made after Obama beat out the Republican presidential nominee for the White House in November .
" It was a bad beginning because it was n't what we promised the American people , what President Obama promised the American people , that we would sit down together , " McCain told CNN 's " State of the Union With John King . "
The $ 787 billion bill made it through Congress with the support of three Republicans -- Sens. Susan Collins and Olympia Snowe of Maine and Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania .
Obama is expected to sign the bill Tuesday in Denver , Colorado .
Watch Democratic and GOP analysts debate bipartisanship »
" This is not ' change we can believe in , ' " Graham , a member of the Senate Banking Committee , told ABC .
He said Democrats " rammed it through the House " after starting out " with the idea , ' We won -- we write the bill . ' "
But Obama 's spokesman insisted the stimulus is a bipartisan success .
Speaking to CBS ' " Face the Nation , " White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said , " We 're happy that Congress , in a bipartisan way , took steps to make whatever happens in this recession easier to take for the American people . "
iReport.com : Share your thoughts on the stimulus plan
And on CNN's " State of the Union , " Gibbs said , " I think what you saw from this president was an unprecedented effort to reach out to Republicans .
Not just in meetings at the White House , but you had the president drive up to Capitol Hill to meet with Republicans where they work . "
McCain fired back .
" Look , I appreciate the fact that the president came over and talked to Republicans , " he said .
" That 's not how you negotiate a result .
You sit down together in a room with competing proposals .
Almost all of our proposals went down on a party - line vote . "
When the next major piece of legislation aimed at helping the economy recover reaches Congress , McCain said that he hopes " we will sit down together and conduct truly bipartisan negotiations .
This was not a bipartisan bill . "
iReport.com : McCain 's actions " totally reprehensible "
McCain added , " Republicans were guilty of this kind of behavior .
I 'm not saying that we did things different .
But Americans want us to do things differently , and they want us to work together . "
Gibbs described things differently .
" This president has always worked in a bipartisan fashion , " he told King .
" He will continue to reach out to Republicans .
John , we hope that Republicans will decide they want to reach back . "

Have you settled for less in your life , when you used to dream that something bigger , something grander , was possible ?
Not only possible , but you knew for certain it would happen , did n’t you ?
Then something happened …
You got responsibilities .
You had to be practical .
But you do n’t have to follow the herd anymore .
You can make your heart and your mind work together .
You simply have to realize that this so - called “ collective wisdom ” is really a collective assumption .
Any of these old sayings ( sleep walking mantras ) sound familiar ?
Get a real job .
Welcome to adulthood !
Grow up .
Keep your head down .
It ’s called work for a reason !
These are all fine and dandy .
They may have been more applicable in say , your grandfather ’s time .
Labor was expected for the larger part of sunlight and there was n’t a lot of opportunity to follow your passions ( unless you liked mining coal ) .
Technology has completely changed that .
Social media , web 2.0 and blogging can help you establish yourself in any field with lightning speed .
The amount of free information online is staggering , and it doubles every few years .
There ’s no longer any excuse .
So what ’s stopping you ?
I ’ve asked hundreds of people what the biggest obstacle to living their dreams is .
The number one response is always uncertainty and doubt .
Not time , not money , but simply the inability to take a risk .
It comes in a few different guises , but under the mask they are all the same .
Here are a few examples of uncertainty and doubt getting in the way of pursuing your dreams :
Not knowing what will happen if you fail .
Being afraid of going for what you want .
Lack of belief in yourself .
Fear of being wrong .
And yes , sometimes even fear of success .
But the biggest deterrent , by far , is not knowing where to start .
You might know what your dreams are , but you just do n’t know how to get there .
You do n’t know how to make them a reality , instead of just a fantasy .
I ’ll tell you a secret …
No one knows how to make their desires real prior to taking the first step .
Knowing comes from doing .
Paths are made by walking .
So the trick to making your dreams happen , is not to have a perfect plan , but to stop caring about not knowing .
The number one secret to making your dreams a reality , is changing your auto - response .
Instead of letting “ I do n’t know ” keep you from moving forward , change your auto - response response to “ I ’ll figure it out . ”
We have a lot of auto - responses and ungrounded beliefs that hold us back from pursuing our dreams .
In my new ebook , Reclaim Your Dreams , I reveal what these obstacles toward living your dreams are , and show you the solutions to moving past them .
As a special gift to Pick the Brain readers , until February 28tht , I ’ll offer a discount of 25{ 54c12dad2cc2b53ae830e39915b1a3e70288dbcbbeb8bbf8395437c5dc3c512c} off the list price .
So instead of $ 24.95 , you ’ll get it for $ 18.70 .
That ’s less than dinner for two , for something that could change your life forever .

We 're just about done with the Scout pack , and our design and coding has already moved on to the next pack .
The weapons and achievements are all nailed down , and we just have to finish up the final artwork on them .
We like to do the final art as late as possible to ensure that we do n't waste any work , which turned out to be a good decision this time around due to the large number of unlockables we tried out as alternatives to the Scattergun .
Balancing his replacement weapon has been very tricky due to large threat difference of the Scout between skilled and non-skilled hands .
More on that soon .
In the meantime , here 's a few answers to some questions we get regularly :
" When 's the next update going to be out ? "
We 've got an update that should be out tomorrow with a bunch of bug & exploit fixes .
Later this week we hope to have another update out that changes the way we store your unlockable items .
You should n't notice much difference , other than if you play on multiple computers we 'll now propagate your item choices .
You can think of that update as the one that moves your inventory into the Steam Cloud .
Once that 's out of the way , we 'll be able to ship the Scout pack .
" Why did you change the minigun 's muzzle flash away from the original one shown in Meet the Heavy ? "
That muzzle flash was one of the earliest effects that we put in the game and it was done before our new particle system was in place .
As we moved forward with the effects we decided that such a cartoony hard - edged look to the effects did n't help the readability of the overall game .
If the muzzle flashes and all the effects had well defined edges , they would visually compete with the rest of the TF2 world and the players .
So it was decided that the effects should be much softer than the rest of the game so as to not overwhelm an already visually dense game .
" Why should I use Natascha ?
And does n't she only do 66 % damage , not 75 % ? "
You 're correct , there was a bug that caused her to lose 0.75 damage off each individual bullet she fired .
She spits out so many bullets that a tiny amount like that added up to a significant difference .
Tomorrow 's update will fix that , and also includes a slight boost to the amount of slowdown she delivers .
Our internal playtesters have been finding her much more useful , especially on the large number of Scouts running around with new toys .
" Why is the Sniper such a fake Australian ?
Are n't several members of the TF2 team Australian ? "
I know , I know … none of us creative types want anything to do with coding past the very basic HTML / CSS we need to know to get our designs to the developers .
Doing development is something for those programming grunts , those code jockeys , those geeks .
Why should we enter the trenches of development when it ’s so nice up here with the Photoshop brushes , afternoon tea , and MacPros ?
Because you ’ll be a better designer for it .
Skeptical ?
Read on and discover 6 reasons why designers should code …
1. Better XHTML
I ’ve worked with and known many designers who knew only the bare minimum needed to get their designs out of Photoshop and into a web format .
Oftentimes they would make use of a software program or plugin like SiteGrinder .
While these programs keep getting better and better at making compliant code , they still do n’t match the human - produced variety .
Knowing how to write your own standards - compliant XHTML will make you a valuable addition to any web team ( emphasis on the standards - compliant part ) .
With all the fuss about PHP , ASP .
NET , Ruby , and many other languages , people tend to forget that everything ends up being HTML in the end , because that ’s what your browser has to have in order to render a page .
The more you know about the medium you work in , the better you work in that medium .
2. Better SEO
And while we ’re talking about standards - compliant code , we should mention SEO .
This is a big buzzword , though not quite as much as it has been in the past .
However , what this means is that SEO is becoming a much more commonplace idea of what a website should strive for , instead of just an added special feature for big business sites .
If you can learn to write your own code , you ’re much closer to being able to list “ SEO Compliant Designs ” on your sheet of available services .
That means you can charge more , and it ’s another badge on your hat .
3. Better Accessibility
Better code and better SEO = better accessibility .
Part of of the job of any designer is to present information in a clear and coherent manner , and on the web that means not solely in a visual manner .
A shoddily - coded website can be a nightmare to navigate if you ’re blind , or even if you ’re using a mobile device .
Learning the ins and outs of developing code for accessibility not only allows you have that knowledge as part of your production skillset , but it will also help you to better understand the considerations you should take when designing for accessibility .
Accessibility is a mandate for all government websites , nearly all education sites , and businesses are starting to see the value in it as well .
The more people you can reach via your site , the more chance you have of accomplishing your goal , whatever it may be .
And that has to be reflected in any successful design .
4. Better Left Side
Being a right - brained creative is great , but giving your left side a workout can spur on creativity of a different nature .
The motto at the bottom of the WordPress website is “ Code Is Poetry ” , and this is because translating a written language to something that can be visually seen is truly an art form .
Learning to write your own code opens up whole new avenues of expression .
Developing your technical and analytical abilities can improve your information design , developing wireframes , and create a pathway to work with interaction design .
And who knows , it may even improve your math skills !
5. Better Communication
It ’s easy to get lost in the techno - jargon used by developers , simply because you may not have been exposed to the type of things they are discussing .
Digging in and working with code yourself will allow you to become familiar with the terminology that is used when conversing about the construction of a site .
Being able to speak the lingo will help when you need to communicate with a developer or project manager about how a design should be implemented .
6. Better Design
You can only do so much knowing the fundamentals of design .
Typography , color theory , composition , etc. are all fantastic and extremely important skills to know ( and know well ) … but eventually if you want to excel in your creativity , you must learn the tools of the trade .
Painters learn about canvas types , paint compositions , and bristle qualities .
Web design is no exception .
Learn to code : you ’ll be better for it .

I 'm not gonna shovel out the walk , so you might as well call me in now .
I work 12 - 14 hour days .
My wife left almost a year ago to go relive her college days ( she 's fucking the third or fourth in a line of grad students at the U of M , from what I hear ) and saddled me with the mortgage and car payment .
The dog now hates me because he 's cooped up in one room all day long when he used to be home with the wife ( too busy doing yoga to stay limber for the college studs to get a job when we were together ) and could go outside or at least have run of the house all day .
Thanks for the dirty look when I saw you out walking YOUR unleashed shit - machine - on - four - legs this morning .
Must be a bitch to be shins deep in the snow while your dog clamors into my yard to leave a steamer in the drift .
Noticed you did n't have a bag with you and kind of caught the way you just kept on walking without picking up Rover 's turds as I rolled up the hill towards another hourlong commute .
Hey , asshole .
Guess what ?
I 'm not an independent consultant or whatever the fuck it is you told me your job is when I was checking out your wife 's ass at the neighborhood picnic this Summer .
I 'm a sales manager .
I get up early , go to the office , slug it out listening to salespeople tell me that our customers wo n't buy our services in this economy ( or as I call it , ' whining about shit that 's really not my problem ' ) until well after you 've had your supper , and typically make it home about the time you 're settling in to watch Real Housewives of Orange County or whatever closet cocksucker show you watch after you put little Peyton and Jacinda to bed .
I 'm beat when I get home .
I eat a sandwich , pet the dog a little , sort the mail , and wish my wife was n't a cum guzzling whore for a Carlson School of Management 's Spring '09 MBA candidates , each of whom is gonna finish fucking my wife , defend a dissertation , get offered a job without having to make a meaningful search , and earn six times more money at age 22 with no experience than I am at age 40 with a BS in marketing and 18 years never once having missed quota for base - plus - ten - percent .
The LAST thing on my mind in these moments of lamentation is putting on the Carhartts and shoveling out the sidewalk when it's - 15 º .
I gotta get up in six hours and get back to the office .
I work for a living , and to tell you the truth , when you called the City to complain earlier this year about snow on the sidewalk and I got the $ 30 WSB invoice from the City for them to come by with their brush - blower , I happily paid it .
It was worth the $ 30 to not have to go out and stand in the wind for 30 minutes .
So this is your fair warning , oh neighbor of mine ... might as well call me in now , because it ain't getting any warmer the rest of this week , my job ai n't getting any less demanding , and as far as I know , my wife has every intention of continuing to let the next generation of useless MBAs keep screwing her spit - lubricated ass .
Which means I have the perfect combination of prohibitive temperatures , discretionary income , and anger at humanity in general to keep paying the city to clear the sidewalk in from of my house well into Spring .
More snow on the way !

Incominciamo dalla fine ( prima parte )
E' sempre molto difficile iniziare un articolo o introdurre un argomento : occorre contestualizzare ciò che si vuole trattare ed è per tale motivo che preferisco iniziare dalla fine .
Ma qual è o meglio che cos ’è questa fine ?
E' quella di un sistema finanziario che si è sviluppato a partire dalla seconda metà degli anni ‘ 90 e che ha visto la sua fine nell 'estate del 2007 con le prime avvisaglie di una crisi sistemica che ha dato origine a parole oramai di uso « comune » quali « credit crunch » e « subprime » .
Scrivo da Londra , l'epicentro del sistema finanziario mondiale e di conseguenza l'epicentro della crisi .
La capitale inglese rappresenta la maggiore piazza finanziaria al mondo essendosi lasciata alle spalle New York e Tokyo in termini di volumi scambiati .
Rappresenta inoltre la culla del sistema capitalistico , il posto in cui lo stesso ha visto i natali e dove i servizi fi-nanziari si sono concentrati .
Io facevo il « banchiere » .
L’ho fatto prima a Milano e successivamente mi sono trasferito nel Regno Unito , una tappa quasi obbligata per chi fa il mio mestiere .
Sono cosciente che la parola banchiere susciti attualmenteun senso di sfiducia e di colpa in un clima da caccia alle streghe e di ricerca di capri espiatori , ma non intendo soffermarmi su aspetti personali né utilizzare il mio spazio per tentare una difesa di una categoria sicuramente colpevole al pari di molte altre .
Ma torniamo alla fine ed all ' inizio del famigerato effetto domino ed immaginiamo di essere negli Stati Uniti .
Siamo in uno scenario di crescita economica forte e tassi di interesse molto favorevoli , non rappresentativi del rischio che stanno finanziando , ma di una forte liquidità nel sistema .
Si sta sviluppando una sorta di corsa nel prestare denaro nella convinzioneche il valore dell ' asset finanziato sia stabile o in crescita e , di converso , il debito garantito dal valore dell ' attivo stesso .
Prendiamo come riferimento una casa ( anche se il settore immobiliare è stato solo la goccia in un oceano di sbagli ) del valore di 100 su cui una banca eroga un mutuo di 70 a un determinato tasso .
Alcuni mesidopo il valore diventa 110 e un'altra banca per impiegare il proprio denaro rifinanzia il mutuo erogato dalla prima banca per 90 , sicura che il valore della casa aumenti ancora , il proprietario così si trova 20 in più con i quali effettuare ristrutturazioni o ancora acquistare altri beni .
Inizia in tale modo a crearsi un circolo virtuoso per banche e soggetti finanziati in cui l'accesso al credito diventa sempre più facile e le banche , per non perdere quote di mercato , e di conseguenza utili , sono disposte ad assumere rischi sempre più elevati .
Si giunge in questa maniera a finanziare oltre il 100 % del valore del bene acquisito e a concedere mutui anche a soggetti che non hanno reddito sufficiente ( e pertanto più rischiosi , definiti subprime ) erogando mutui variabili , molto convenienti sui primi anni ( solo quota interessi ) , i cosiddetti killer su quelli a venire .
D'altronde , se il soggetto finanziato non riuscirà a ripagare le rate , la banca entrerà in possesso del bene e ne trarrà comunque profitto .
I finanziatori non si limitano però a questo e decidono di vendere i rischi assunti , in maniera tale da contenerli , e i rendimenti ad essi collegati sul mercato sotto forma di prodotti finanziari ( cartolarizzazioni ) dividendoli in base alloro profilo , o più banalmente in base al tipo di attivo e soggetto finanziato in maniera da creare pacchettipiù o meno omogenei e certificati dalle agenzie di rating .
Questi prodotti permettono di ripartire il rischio su più entità ed offrono rendimenti interessanti , poi a loro volta vengono creati mix di questi prodotti con altri ecc ... e alla fine la catena , che collega finanziamento originale e finanziatore , diventa complessa e fatta di molti passaggi .
Non intendo scendere in complicazioni ulteriori come ad esempio la possibilità di comprare del debito , ossia uno di questi portafogli , con ulteriore debito ( specialità questa degli hedge funds ) .

It takes weeks or months for the effect of most antidepressants to kick in , time that can feel like an eternity to those who need the drugs the most .
But new research suggests that a protein called p11 , previously shown to play a role in a person ’s susceptibility to depression , activates a serotonin receptor in the brain known for producing a rapid antidepressant response .
If scientists could develop drugs to target this receptor , they might produce an effect in as little as two days .
The finding , reported by Rockefeller University ’s Paul Greengard , Jennifer L. Warner - Schmidt and colleagues in Sweden , solidifies p11 as a key determinant of vulnerability to depression and may lead investigators to new treatments .
Previous research by Greengard , who is Vincent Astor Professor and head of the Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Neuroscience , and coauthor Per Svenningsson established p11 as a key signaling molecule for a neurotransmitter known as serotonin , which has long been linked to mood .
They also showed that the interaction between p11 and serotonin influences an individual ’s susceptibility to depression and his or her response to antidepressant treatments .
( They later showed that p11 and serotonin also play a role in the symptoms of advanced Parkinson ’s disease . )
These earlier studies focused on the serotonin 1B receptor .
For the new study , Greengard , Svenningsson and their colleagues looked at p11 ’s interaction with another receptor known as serotonin 4 , which has been shown to produce a rapid antidepressant response in rodent models of depression .
Because serotonin 4 is expressed outside the brain , particularly in the gastrointestinal system , scientists have had difficulty homing in on it to evaluate its potential as an effective therapeutic target .
Using transgenic mice that express a green fluorescent protein when the serotonin 4 receptor is switched on , the researchers showed that p11 and serotonin 4 are expressed together in regions of the brain that are associated with depression .
Previous studies by Greengard ’s team showed that p11 is required for the antidepressant actions of a molecule called an agonist , which activates the serotonin 1B receptor .
To determine whether p11 is required for the action of a serotonin 4 agonist , the researchers injected two groups of mice with a compound called RS67333 , which has been shown to produce antidepressant - like effects .
They found that the antidepressant activity of RS67333 was normal in normal mice but absent in mice that were lacking p11 .
“ Together , these findings confirm the essential role played by p11 in modulating signaling through the serotonin 4 receptor and support the concept that this protein may be a key determinant of vulnerability to depression , ” says Greengard .
Currently available antidepressants require weeks or months to produce therapeutic effects in patients .
Studies in rodents have shown that behavioral responses that typically require two to three weeks of antidepressant treatment will occur after only one or two days of treatment with the serotonin 4 receptor agonist RS67333 .
The interaction of p11 with serotonin 4 , says Greengard , represents a promising avenue of investigation for improved antidepressants .
“ There is a pressing clinical need for faster - acting antidepressants , ” says Greengard .
“ An understanding of the cellular mechanisms underlying the therapeutic actions of these drugs may lead to better treatments with fewer side effects . ”
Karl Rove is still stiff - arming Congress by refusing to testify in the U.S. Attorneys firing scandal -- but he has suddenly changed his tune about cooperating with federal prosecutors , TPMMuckraker 's Murray Waas reports :
Rove will cooperate with a federal criminal inquiry underway into the firings of nine U.S. attorneys and has already spoken to investigators in a separate , internal DOJ investigation into the prosecution of former Alabama Gov. Don Siegelman , his attorney said in an interview .
Rove previously refused to cooperate with an earlier Justice Department inquiry into the firings .
The Justice Department 's Inspector General and its Office of Professional Responsibility ( OPR ) said in a report released last September detailing their earlier probe of the firings of the U.S. attorneys that their investigation was severely " hindered " by the refusal by Rove and other senior Bush administration officials to cooperate with the probe .
Rove 's attorney , Robert Luskin , said that Rove , however , will cooperate with a federal criminal probe of the firings being led by Nora Dannehy , the Acting U.S. Attorney for Connecticut who was selected by former Attorney General Michael Mukasey to lead the investigation .
Dannehy has recently empaneled a federal grand jury to hear evidence in the matter .

The Hidden History of Zionism
Chapter 1
The Four Myths
It is not accidental that when anyone attempts to examine the nature of Zionism – its origins , history and dynamics – they meet with people who terrorize or threaten them .
Quite recently , after mentioning a meeting on the plight of the Palestinian people during an interview on KPFK , a Los Angeles radio station , the organizers of the public meeting were deluged with bomb threats from anonymous callers .
Nor is it easy in the United States or Western Europe to disseminate information about the nature of Zionism or to analyze the specific events which denote Zionism as a political movement .
Even the announcement on university campuses of authorized forums or meetings on the subject invariably engenders a campaign designed to close off discussion .
Posters are torn down as fast as they are put up .
Meetings are packed by flying squads of Zionist youth who seek to break them up .
Literature tables are vandalized and leaflets and articles appear accusing the speaker of anti-Semitism or , in the case of those of Jewish origin , of self - hatred .
Vindictiveness and slander are so universally meted out to anti-Zionists because the disparity between the official fiction about Zionism and the Israeli state , on the one hand , and the barbarous practice of this colonial ideology and coercive apparatus , on the other , is so vast .
People are in shock when they have an opportunity to hear or read about the century of persecution suffered by the Palestinians , and , thus , the apologists for Zionism are relentless in seeking to prevent coherent , dispassionate examination of the virulent and chauvinist record of the Zionist movement and of the state which embodies its values .
The irony of this is that when we study what the Zionists have written and said – particularly when addressing themselves – no doubt remains about what they have done or of their place in the political spectrum , dating from the last quarter of the 19th century to the present day .
Four overriding myths have shaped the consciousness of most people in our society about Zionism .
The first is that of “ A land without a people for a people without a land . ”
This myth was sedulously cultivated by early Zionists to promote the fiction that Palestine was a remote , desolate place ready for the taking .
This claim was quickly followed by denial of Palestinian identity , nationhood or legitimate entitlement to the land in which the Palestinian people have lived throughout their recorded history .
The second is the myth of Israeli democracy .
Innumerable newspaper stories or television references to the Israeli state are followed by the assertion that it is the only “ real ” democracy in the Middle East .
In fact , Israel is as democratic as the apartheid state of South Africa .
Civil liberty , due process and the most basic human rights are by law denied those who do not meet racial , religious criteria .
The third myth is that of “ security ” as the motor force of Israeli foreign policy .
Zionists maintain that their state must be the fourth largest military power in the world because Israel has been forced to defend itself against imminent menace from primitive , hate - consumed Arab masses only recently dropped from the trees .
The fourth myth is that of Zionism as the moral legatee of the victims of the Holocaust .
This is at once the most pervasive and insidious of the myths about Zionism .
Ideologues for the Zionist movement have wrapped themselves in the collective shroud of the six million Jews who fell victim to Nazi mass murder .
The bitter and cruel irony of this false claim is that the Zionist movement itself actively colluded with Nazism from its inception .
To most people it appears anomalous that the Zionist movement , which forever invokes the horror of the Holocaust , should have collaborated actively with the most vicious enemy ever faced by the Jews .
The record , however , reveals not merely common interests but a deep ideological affinity rooted in the extreme chauvinism which they share .

NEW YORK , Feb 18 ( Reuters ) - Cutting taxes to try to stimulate the economy could do more harm than good in a zero interest rate environment as it can heighten the risk of deflation , according to a recent New York Federal Reserve study .
Policies that are aimed at increasing the supply of goods can be counterproductive when the main problem is insufficient demand , New York Fed economist Gauti Eggertsson said in a research paper entitled “ Can tax cuts deepen the recession ? ”
“ The emphasis should be on policies that stimulate spending , ” Eggertsson said , adding that his research found the impact of tax cuts is “ fundamentally different ” with interest rates near zero .
“ At zero short - term nominal interest rates , tax cuts reduce output in a standard New Keynesian ( economic ) model .
They do so because they increase deflationary pressure , ” he wrote .
Eggertsson ’s study focused primarily on labor taxes and some sales taxes .
Cutting payroll taxes , for example , would create an incentive for people to work more .
But if there are not enough jobs , this could have a negative effect : creating more demand for work and thus driving down wages .
And with interest rates near zero , the Fed can not cut rates further to fight deflation .
President Barack Obama on Tuesday signed into law a $ 787 billion package of measures to lift the recession - mired U.S. economy that included about $ 287 billion in tax cuts .
Eggertsson ’s findings counter the argument that cutting taxes to put an extra buck in consumers ’ pockets will boost their spending .
Instead , given the current economic backdrop , it is likely people would save money from temporary tax cuts , given the recession and expectations that tax increases are inevitable in the future .
He said that while a number of economists have argued that aggressive tax cuts are needed to revive the U.S. economy , policy - makers should “ view with a great deal of skepticism ” studies that use post World War Two data -- a period characterized by positive interest rates .
The best ways to stimulate spending , according to Eggertsson ’s study , is through traditional government spending and a credible commitment to boosting inflation , creating an incentive to spend now before prices rise .

Your 15 Minutes Are Up We 're So Over You , You 're So Over : A Compendium of Last Gasps
Every January , The Stranger 's news staff kicks off the New Year with a list of local people , ideas , businesses , and trends we think have run their course .
Last year , our predictions ranged from uncannily on target ( " serious layoffs at the Seattle Times " ) to woefully optimistic ( plummeting teen pregnancy rates in the wake of a new law requiring comprehensive sex education ) .
Here are the people , institutions , and ideas whose 15 minutes are up .
The Seattle Times
The 117 - year - old daily paper spent much of 2008 slicing away at the fat — and more — in an effort to deal with a difficult debt load and a terrible economic environment for newspapers .
Now the question is whether cutting nearly a quarter of the paper 's newsroom staff has produced enough savings to right the Blethen family 's favored ship .
The conventional wisdom : no .
These are tough times for newspapers everywhere — all the more for one with a strong competitor ( the Seattle Post - Intelligencer ) to which it 's financially handcuffed by a joint operating agreement , no wealthy parent company to bail it out ( like Hearst , which owns the P - I ) , and a leader with a track record of shortsightedness ( a good chunk of Frank Blethen 's current debt problems are related to a vanity purchase of a bunch of papers in Maine in 1998 , shortly before the bottom fell out of the newspaper industry ) .
The Seattle Times may not go under in 2009 , but it wo n't end the year in a very recognizable form .
Nick Licata
Lefties want Nick Licata to run for mayor .
City Hall gossips speculate that he 'll retire .
But whatever the city council 's most outspoken affordable - housing advocate , streetcar opponent , and civil - rights champion does next , it will probably have as much impact as his increasingly lonely votes against overwhelming council majorities — very little .
Licata has increasingly become a voice in the wilderness , as council allies have retired or been voted off the dais .
Licata may leave the council or stick around for one more term , but holding up the losing end of 8 – 1 votes is not a mayoral platform .
Obamamania
Aw , you 're a lefty who LOVES Barack Obama .
He 's your savior , you 're a cliché , and that does n't bother you a bit .
Well , get ready for a year of Obama heartbreak .
The guy is a politician , with 2012 to think about .
Starry - eyed idealists , be warned : Rick Warren is just the beginning .
Obama will bring big change in some areas , particularly foreign policy and the war in Iraq .
But he 's not going to win the culture wars .
Heck , he probably wo n't even spend much time fighting them .
Abortion , gay rights , separation of church and state — do n't expect a lot of progress on those fronts in 2009 , or you 're likely to end the New Year crying into your official Obama handkerchief .
Desegregated Schools
In response to a massive budget crisis , Seattle Public Schools is shuttering buildings , cutting transportation services , and ramping up plans for " neighborhood schools " — a warm and fuzzy term that translates , loosely , as " resegregation . "
South End families ( read : minorities ) will end up at South End schools , while students in Roosevelt , Lake City , and Ballard ( read : honkies ) will stay in their respective neighborhoods .
With plenty of evidence that the district has already failed to support schools in Seattle 's South End — the grossly underenrolled Rainier Beach is a perfect example — it 's likely things will get worse for kids in South Seattle before they get better .
Ron Sims's Local Relevance
We do n't agree with the glib assessment of some politicos that King County Executive Ron Sims is " checked out . "
We think he 's really , really , really checked in — to everything but being county executive .
Whether it 's managing his Twitter account , sending reporters messages on Facebook , opposing an incredibly popular light - rail expansion measure , or applying for a job in the Obama administration , Sims just does n't seem engaged in his job as county executive .
Whether he stays on for a fourth term , heads to the other Washington , or goes down in defeat to King County Council member Larry Phillips — a potential candidate for Sims 's position —
Sims 's days as a major player in local politics are over .
Darcy Burner
Darcy Burner , you are done .
Do n't even think about running for political office again next year , or the year after that , or ever .
You fought the good fight ( twice ) against Dave Reichert , the photogenic sheriff turned 8th Congressional District representative .
You came close .
Congratulations .
But your time running for office is over .
Get appointed to some partisan post somewhere if you want to stay in politics .
One of these days , a Democrat will win Reichert 's seat .
But it wo n't be you .
Kemper Freeman
The Bellevue developer , transit nemesis , and all - around roadblock to progress in the Seattle region got serious comeuppance last November when voters throughout the region — including in his home turf of Bellevue — overwhelmingly supported raising sales taxes to expand Sound Transit 's light - rail system .
Even before the election , two organizations he practically runs — the Bellevue Downtown Association and the Bellevue Chamber of Commerce — endorsed the measure , dealing a major blow to the notion that suburbanites do n't want alternatives to driving .
In debates , Kemper Freeman came across as doddering and confused — fitting attributes for a relic of the car - centric past .
His time in the region 's political spotlight is over .
Maple Valley
You are dead to us , Maple Valley .
It 's not just that we never wanted to visit you — after all , you 're merely a ballooning bedroom community with no economic engine or activities that make you worth visiting — but that you do n't want to come to the city anymore , either .
The math on exurbs like Maple Valley , more than 20 miles southeast of Seattle , just does n't add up anymore .
Gas prices in 2008 exceeded $ 4 a gallon , and they 're sure to spike again in 2009 .
And commutes to downtown jobs can exceed an hour .
It costs too much time and money to live in Maple Valley .
And public transit can't save you , with buses stopping less than once per hour on weekdays ( and with no service at all on weekends ) .
The light - rail line we approved in the general election — the one that reaches Bellevue and Redmond — does n't even come close to you , nor should it .
So long , Maple Valley .
You shall not be missed .
Cheap Bus Service
We 'd love bus service to be free — hell , we think transportation should be a human right — but the economics of tax - funded bus service just do n't work out that way .
As gas prices rise out of their current slump ( and union wages continue to rise ) , the cost of bus service is only going to keep heading higher — which means the two fare increases already approved for next year wo n't be the last .
LGBT Centers
Gay people in Seattle need a gathering place for poetry slams and book swaps the way black people need Jesse Jackson .
LGBT centers — nonprofits that have no specific agenda but to create a gay " place " — have become a supply without demand .
In big cities , gay people find dates in bars and on websites like gay.com .
And the organizing model that LGBT centers facilitated , collecting activists in a circle to pass around a talking feather , died with the advent of online social networks .
In the past year , Seattle 's LGBT Center collapsed after investing heavily in the previous year 's QueerFest — a Pride concert held on Capitol Hill to protest the Pride Parade moving downtown — i.e. , into the mainstream of the city life .
Gays no longer need to circle their wagons behind an LGBT center 's walls — nor should they put up with " gay rights " organizations that lack an agenda .
Meth
In 2008 , Washington attorney general Rob McKenna campaigned for reelection , in part , on his successful crackdown on meth .
Indeed , the state Department of Social and Health Services reported in December that meth labs and the number of people entering meth treatment are declining .
And the panhandlers on Broadway seem less twitchy than a couple years ago — praise Jesus .
But McKenna can stop slapping himself on the back .
Drug trends are like Whac - a - Mole :
When you smack down one rodent , another pops up somewhere else .
So while meth takes a breather , get used to more pharmaceutical opiates , like OxyContin , popping up .
According to a report on drug trends in King County , deaths from fatal overdoses of prescription - type opiates totaled 151 in 2007 , up almost 700 percent from a decade before .
So , meth , we bid you farewell .
For now .
Matt Hasselbeck
Matt Hasselbeck , the Seattle Seahawks ' 33 - year - old quarterback ( that 's ancient in football years ) missed nearly half the 2008 season due to injury and did n't do the team any favors when he did manage to make it on the field .
Next season , Hasselbeck will be in the last year of his contract .
With coach Jim Mora Jr. taking over for Mike Holmgren — who brought Hasselbeck along with him from Green Bay — in 2009 , the clock is ticking on Hasselbeck 's NFL career .
Fixed - Gear Bikes
It 's simple math :
Take the amount of money you save by buying a fixed - gear bike .
Add that to the extra cachet you acquire by riding it around .
Now subtract the cost of fixing your broken bones when you crash and do n't have health insurance .
The economics do n't compute .
Fixed - gear bikes , like Hummers , wo n't pencil out in the New Year 's new economy .
Richard McIver 's Heart
Seattle City Council member Richard McIver is retiring this year , but we want his heart to last for a long time to come .
Look , we love that McIver is a hard - drinkin ' , chain - smokin ' , red - meat - eatin ' sonofabitch .
But Christ , the man is a walking heart attack .
McIver 's had , like , 26 heart surgeries ; is known around City Hall for taking an elevator from the second floor when he goes out for a smoke ; and refuses to go to the gym because he can't smoke on the StairMaster .
We 'd like to see McIver finish out his term and go out in a blaze of glory , not on a stretcher .
Someone get that man some carrot sticks .

Zimbabwean Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai has said the cost of rebuilding his country 's economy could run as high as $ 5 bn ( £ 3.5 bn ) .
Mr Tsvangirai was speaking after meeting officials in neighbouring South Africa to discuss a recovery plan .
Zimbabwe 's political deadlock recently ended with a power - sharing deal , but the economy is in a state of collapse .
Also on Friday , the UN said more than 80,000 people had now been infected by Zimbabwe 's cholera outbreak .
At least 3,759 people had died from the disease , the World Health Organization said .
Mr Tsvangirai was in South Africa with Finance Minister Tendai Biti , where they met South African President Kgalema Motlanthe and Finance Minister Trevor Manuel .
Both Zimbabwean officials are members of the Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) , which recently agreed to form a unity government with President Robert Mugabe 's Zanu - PF .
Investment needed
The power - sharing deal was agreed after disputed elections and months of talks , during which the economy slid into a deepening crisis .
We are going to use a multi-currency approach
Morgan Tsvangirai
Zimbabwean prime minister
Harare diary : ' Motivated workers '
" As for the long - term economic recovery it has not been assessed , " Mr Tsvangirai was quoted as saying at a press briefing in Cape Town .
But he added : " I think it would run into billions of dollars , maybe as high as $ 5 bn . "
Inflation in Zimbabwe - estimated by some economists at 10 sextillion per cent - has left its currency almost worthless .
Mr Biti said earlier this week that soldiers and civil servants would be paid in US dollars .
But on Friday Mr Tsvangirai ruled out adopting the South African rand .
" Our currency is devalued almost to a point of non-use , so we are going to use a multi- currency approach , " he said .
" But at the moment there is no talk about the randification [ of the currency ] .
It is a multi-currency facility we are looking at . "
He also said foreign direct investment would be " one of the areas of focus " as Zimbabwe began to rebuild .
' Aid is aid '
He also appealed to countries which are wary of giving aid with Mr Mugabe still at the helm .
One person in Roy Bennett 's cell died yesterday and the body is still to be removed .
Prisoners are literally starving to death .
MDC statement " Aid is aid .
We do n't care where it comes from as long as it helps Zimbabweans , " AP news agency quotes him as saying .
Zimbabwean central bank governor Gideon Gono said international and regional financiers had offered the country $ 500 m in credit , but remain cautious over conflicting policy signals , Reuters news agency reported .
The leaders also discussed the detention of Roy Bennett - the MDC 's nominee for deputy agricultural minister - who was arrested last week on charges including terrorism .
The mayor of Mutare , the eastern city where he is in custody , visited Mr Bennett on Friday .
In a statement afterwards , the MDC said the conditions at the prison were " deplorable " .
" One person in Roy Bennett 's cell died yesterday and the body is still to be removed .
Prisoners are literally starving to death , " he said .
Mr Bennett 's lawyer says his bail hearing will take place at the High Court next Tuesday .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The Dow Jones industrial average and Standard & Poor 's 500 finished their worst January ever Friday as investors eyed abysmal reports on economic growth and quarterly earnings .
The Dow Jones industrial average ( INDU ) ended the day down 148 points , or 1.8 % .
The Standard & Poor 's 500 ( SPX ) index lost 19 points , or 2.3 % .
The Nasdaq composite ( COMP ) lost 31 points , or 2 % .
Stocks gained in the morning as investors breathed a sigh of relief that the abysmal fourth - quarter GDP report was not as bad as economists had expected .
Upbeat earnings from Amazon.com and a few other companies also helped Wall Street in the early going .
But any early goodwill soon petered out and stocks turned lower .
Weak readings on manufacturing and consumer sentiment added to the day 's declines , as did more layoff news .
Talk that Senate Republicans could shoot down the proposed $ 819 billion economic stimulus plan also weighed on the market , said Tom Schrader , managing director at Stifel Nicolaus .
" There 's just nothing good out there , " Schrader said .
Companies have announced more than 100,000 job cuts this week alone .
" What 's especially concerning is that we are seeing companies start to lay people off in anticipation of the slowness rather than in response to it , " he said .
Stocks tumbled Thursday following bleak reports on earnings , housing and employment .
That caused the Nasdaq and S&P 500 to break a four - session winning streak and the Dow to break a three - session advance .
Investors put money back into stock mutual funds over the past week , after withdrawing money in the previous week .
For the week ended Jan. 28 , investors poured $ 6.5 billion into stock funds , according to investment - research firm Trim Tabs .
In the previous week , investors pulled $ 138 million out of funds .
Wretched month :
It was the worst January ever for the Dow industrials and S&P 500 , according to Stock Trader 's Almanac data .
The Dow lost 8.8 % and the S&P 500 lost 8.6 % in the month .
The Nasdaq 's loss of 6.4 % was eclipsed by last January 's loss of 9.9 % .
That 2008 loss was the worst in the tech average 's history , going back to its inception in 1971 .
Among the sector decliners during January , it was a particularly ugly month for bank stocks .
Fans of the S&P's January barometer know that a weak January can spell doom for the rest of the year , as per the saying " As goes January , so goes the year . "
Standard & Poor 's market historian Sam Stovall has looked at the correlation going back to 1945 .
Since then , whenever the S&P 500 gained in January , the market continued to rise during the rest of the year 85 % of the time , posting an average gain of 11.6 % during those 11 months .
But the stats are less consistent when the market fell in January .
Since 1945 , a decline in that month yielded a decline in the next 11 months only 48 % of the time , for an average loss in that period of 2.2 % .
GDP : Gross domestic product growth , the broadest measure of the nation 's economy , plunged at a 3.8 % annual rate in the fourth quarter of last year .
It was the biggest drop in GDP since the first quarter of 1982 , when it declined 6.4 % .
Still , economists had forecast that GDP would decline 5.4 % , according to a Briefing .com survey .

No ordinary recession
Axel Leijonhufvud
This recession is different .
Balance sheets of consumers , firms , and banks are under strain .
The private sector is bent on reducing debt and this offsets Keynesian stimulus more than standard flow calculations would suggest .
Bank deleveraging is by far the most dangerous .
Fiscal stimulus will not have much effect as long as the financial system is deleveraging .
This is not an ordinary recession that differs from other recent episodes simply by being somewhat more severe .
It differs in kind .
The end of the Cold War brought a decline in military spending and a recession which impinged most heavily on the states , like California , where the military - industrial complex was an important part of the local economy .
The nationwide unemployment rate rose from 5.25 % in 1989 to 7.5 % in 1992 .
It then fell every year reaching just under 4 % in 2000 .
The “ free market ” took care of the recession of the early 1990’s .
Resources moved from the defence industries , trickling into other uses through innumerable channels .
The federal government did not need to take a hand .
Beginning in 1993 , the federal deficit in fact shrank every year turning into a modest surplus in 1998 .
That was a very ordinary recession .
If the current situation were at all similar we would expect a recession in residential construction with unemployment among construction workers and mortgage brokers .
Naturally , recent boom areas would be hard hit but we would expect resources gradually to trickle into alternative employment .
Instead , we are threatened by a veritable disaster .
Balance sheet recessions
What is the difference ?
It resides in the state of balance sheets .
The financial crisis has put much of the banking system on the edge – or beyond -- of insolvency .
Large segments of the business sector are saddled with much short - term debt that is difficult or impossible to roll over in the current market .
After years of near zero saving , American households are heavily indebted .
The holes that have opened up in the balance sheets of the private sector are very large and still growing .
A recent estimate by Jan Hatzius and Andrew Tilton of Goldman Sachs totes up capital losses of $ 2.1 trillion ; Nouriel Roubini thinks the total is likely to be $ 3 trillion .
About half of these losses belong to financial institutions which means that more banks are insolvent – or nearly so – than has been publicly recognised so far .
So the private sector as a whole is bent on reducing debt .
Businesses will use depreciation charges and sell off inventories to do so .
Households are trying once more to save .
Less investment and more saving spell declining incomes .
The cash flows supporting the servicing of debts are dwindling .
This is a destabilising process but one that works relatively slowly .
The efforts by financial firms to deleverage are the more dangerous because they can trigger a rapid avalanche of defaults ( Leijonhufvud 2009 ) .
Three examples
Richard Koo ( 2003 ) coined the term “ balance sheet recession ” to characterise the endless travail of Japan following the collapse of its real estate and stock market bubbles in 1990 .
The Japanese government did not act to repair the balance sheets of the private sector following the crash .
Instead , it chose a policy of keeping bank rate near zero so as to reduce deposit rates and let the banks earn their way back into solvency .
At the same time it supported the real sector by repeated large doses of Keynesian deficit spending .
It took a decade and a half for these policies to bring the Japanese economy back to reasonable health .
The US Great Depression saw no consistent policy of deficit spending on adequate scale in the 1930’s .
War spending not only brought the economy back to full resource utilisation but also crowded out private consumption to a degree ( Barro 2009 ) .
1
The deficits run during the war meant that :
At war ’s end , the federal government ’s balance sheet showed a debt of a size never before seen , but also
The balance sheets of the private sector were finally back in good shape .
At the time , a majority of forecasts predicted that the economy would slip back into depression once defence expenditures were terminated and the armed forces demobilised .
The forecasts were wrong .
This famous postwar “ forecasting debacle ” demonstrated how simple income - expenditure reasoning , ignoring the state of balance sheets , can lead one completely astray .
The lesson to be drawn from these two cases is that deficit spending will be absorbed into the financial sinkholes in private sector balance sheets and will not become effective until those holes have been filled .
During the years that national income fails to respond , tax receipts will be lower so that the national debt is likely to end up larger than if the banking sector ’s losses had been “ nationalised ” at the outset .
The Swedish policy following the 1992 crisis has been often referred to in recent months .
Sweden acted quickly and decisively to close insolvent banks , and to quarantine their bad assets into a special fund .
2
Eventually , all the assets , good and bad , ended up in the private banking sector again .
The stockholders in the failed banks lost all their equity while the loss to taxpayers of the bad assets was minimal in the end .
The operation was necessary to the recovery but what actually got the economy out of a very sharp and deep recession was the 25 - 30 % devaluation of the krona which produced a long period of strong export - led growth .
Needless to say , the US is in no position to emulate this aspect of the Swedish success story .
US predicaments
Strong contractionary forces are at work in the US emanating both from the capital and the income accounts .
Stabilisation requires major policy actions on both fronts .
First , the financial system must be recapitalised so as to remove the relentless pressure to deleverage from the banks .
Second , a spending stimulus sufficient to reverse the rapidly worsening decline in incomes must be administered .
When the entire private sector is bent on shortening its balance sheet and paying down debt , the public sector ’s balance sheet must move in the opposite , offsetting direction .
When the entire private sector is striving to save , the government must dis -save .
The political obstacles to doing these things on a sufficient scale are formidable .
If banking system losses are of the magnitude estimated by Goldman Sachs or Roubini , the banks need capital injections of at least another $ 200 - 300 billion .
Even if injections equal to all their losses could be effected , the banks might still want to contract , now that they know how dangerous their leverage of yesteryear was .
The American public understands clearly that the present disaster was fashioned on Wall Street ( albeit with some stimulus from Fed policy ) .
Outright bail - outs are a “ hard sell ” therefore .
But the American ideological taboo against “ nationalisation ” also stands in the way of dealing with the matter in the straightforward way that Sweden did .
The present administration , like the last , would like to recapitalise the banks at least partly by attracting private capital .
That can hardly be accomplished as long as the value of large chunks of the banks ’ assets remains anybody ’s guess .
Government guarantees against ( some part of ) losses that may be incurred might solve this problem .
But it would be a strangely contrived way out of a political impasse .
Fiscal stimulus will not have much effect as long as the financial system is deleveraging .
Even if that problem were to be more or less solved , the government deficit would have to offset both the decline in industry investment and the rise in household saving – a gap that is rising as the recession deepens .
Here , too , the public is sceptical and prone to conclude that a program that only slows or stops the decline but fails to “ jump start ” the economy must have been a waste of tax payers ’ money .
The most effective composition of such a program is also a problem .
Almost all American states now suffer under self - imposed constitutional balanced budget requirements and are consequently acting as powerful amplifiers of recession with respect to both income and employment .
The states will spend everything they get , as will a great many local governments .
The point of the stimulus package is to increase spending .
Income maintenance for unemployed and other low income households will also be effective .
3
Tax cuts will produce considerably less spending per dollar than these other programmes .
However , the political prospects seem to portend a less than ideal program mix .
Perils , present and future
If government programs end up not being large enough to turn the recession around , we have to look forward to a deflationary period of indeterminate length .
If they do succeed , however , severe inflationary pressures may surface quite quickly .
The US ratio of federal debt to GNP is not particularly high at this time .
But it does not take into account the very large off - balance liabilities of entitlement programs .
Since the present crisis began , moreover , the Federal Reserve System and other federal agencies have made bail - out , loan and credit guarantee commitments totalling many trillions of dollars with uncertain eventual implications for the consolidated federal balance sheet .
Much will depend on the willingness of the nation ’s foreign creditors to continue to accumulate or at least to hold dollars at low rates of interest .
Should this willingness falter , inflation will be hard to contain .
There is much to fear beyond fear itself .

The greatest motivation poster ever conceived ?
Millions of copies of the " Keep Calm and Carry On " poster were printed on the eve of World War II , but never displayed .
Now the message has taken on a new lease of life in our troubled peacetime .
The simple five - word message is the very model of British restraint and stiff upper lip .
Keep calm and carry on .
In 1939 , with war against Germany looming , the Government designed three posters to steady the public 's resolve and maintain morale .
These featured the crown of King George VI set against a bold red background , and three distinctive slogans - " Freedom is in Peril " , " Your Courage , Your Cheerfulness , Your Resolution Will Bring Us Victory " , and " Keep Calm and Carry On " .
Two - and - a - half million copies of " Keep Calm " were printed , to be distributed in the event of a national catastrophe , but remained in storage throughout the war .
The message was all but forgotten until 2000 , when a copy was discovered in a box of books bought at auction by Stuart Manley , a bookseller from Northumberland .
Many of the British home front slogans are well remembered

" I did n't know anything about it but I showed it to my wife .
We both liked it so we decided to frame it and put it in the shop , " explains Mr Manley .
" Lots of people saw it and wanted to buy it .
We refused all offers but eventually we decided we should get copies made for sale . "
Sales remained modest until 2005 , when it was featured as a Christmas gift idea in a national newspaper supplement .
" All hell broke loose , " says Mr Manley .
" Our website broke down under the strain , the phone never stopped ringing and virtually every member of staff had to be diverted into packing posters . "
Soothing words
The poster was just one of hundreds produced by the Ministry of Information during the war to influence public opinion .
" The poster was a major medium in a way that it is n't now , " says Professor Jim Aulich , an expert in propaganda art at Manchester Metropolitan University .
" It was n't competing with television .
It was one of the main ways of reaching people , through billboards and on public transport . "
Rescued from obscurity after 70 years , the Ministry of Information 's appeal for calm has risen to cult status .
Mr Manley 's store , Barter Books in Alnwick , receives an average of 1,000 orders a month from around the world .
Customers include 10 Downing Street and assorted embassies .
The design has been reproduced on T - shirts and coffee mugs , shopping bags and cufflinks .
It has also spawned imitators .
One company has given it a twist , replacing the original slogan with " Now Panic and Freak Out " .

To some , the world in 2009 seems as uncertain as it was in 1939 , even if modern - day anxieties focus on redundancy and recession rather than bombs and the Blitz .
Perhaps this is why the message still seems so relevant .
Of course , it might be difficult for the current government to come up with a poster with quite the same appeal during this time of economic stress .
Context is everything , says social psychologist Dr Lesley Prince .
" If the government is in tune with you , you will listen .
If you think the government is working on your behalf , you will listen . "
This was indisputably the case during WWII , but is less clear - cut even in the most troubled period of peacetime .
Stiff upper lip
And a message of such powerful simplicity might not be so forthcoming these days .
Today 's government posters attempt to convince the public of an unappreciated danger and get them to modify their behaviour .
The " Keep Calm " poster is merely an injunction to think another way and continue acting as you have always acted .
The propaganda was supposed to be rousing with a very British tone " It 's very good , almost zen , " says Dr Prince .
" It works as a personal mantra now .
If people are thinking ' I 'm about to lose the house ' , it 's good advice . "
People are drawn to the calming Britishness of the message , says Mr Manley .
" It 's interesting to look at the kind of places we often sell to ; doctors ' surgeries , hospitals , schools and government departments .
It seems to strike a chord anywhere that works at a hectic pace . "
Prof Aulich adds that the message has universal appeal .
" It speaks to peoples ' personal neuroses .
It 's not ideological , it 's not urging people to fight for freedom like some propaganda posters did . "
Following the end of WWII , most of the posters are believed to have been pulped , never having seen the light of day .
Only two original copies are known to have survived .
Thanks to a chance discovery in a dusty box of books , the soothing entreaty is finally having its intended effect , bringing comfort to a nation in turmoil .
Below is a selection of your comments .
Someone gave me this poster just before Christmas , when my husband was in hospital , very seriously ill with a disease which is causing fits and dementia .
He also broke his hip in a fall in hospital and picked up the noro- virus .
So did I and spent Christmas day in bed alone , having sent the family home .
It helped and continues to help as my husband 's illness continues .
Alison Dennison , Shipley , UK Nice , and better judged than Lance Corporal Jones ' " Do n't panic ! " .
By avoiding any use of the word panic , they avoid panic , in the same way that air traffic controllers do not say " do not take - off yet " lest it puts the though of take - off into pilots ' heads .

We have one of these posters framed in our hallway .
It looks good as our house is 1930s and for me it pretty much sums up the right approach to modern life so it 's still good advice after all this time .
Charlie , London
It 's messages like these that make me proud to be British .
So often I 'm on the cusp of renouncing my national identity and becoming a man without a country , free of all the stereotypes and nonsense that we define each other with - and then five words like this remind there 's something really great about the public mentality here .
Keep Calm and Carry On . Sums us up more than any other phrase I 'd say .
Robert Richardson , Norwich , UK
While I feel we love the slogan because it captures a historic Britishness , unfortunately it does n't articulate what it means to be British in a 21st Century .
With the government using fear of terrorism to push through draconian legislation and the media whipping us up into a constant state of anxiety and worry , maybe it should be changed to " Panic - stay at home " .
Dr Jimmy Blake , Ashford , Kent I love the poster , but I also love a recent remix that reads : LEAVE EVERYTHING AND GO BALLISTIC .
Personally , this other one suits me more .
Sol , Sterzing , South Tyrol , Italy I have this poster in my office - it says it all .
Steady on the drama and hysteria , and just get on with it .
Fab .
Rachel , Peterborough Someone should put out a cross stitch or embroidery pattern of Keep Calm and Carry On - just stitching it would be beneficial right about now .
Ann Zavala , Parma , Idaho , USA I saw it for the first time recently on a T - shirt that James May was wearing in his new TV series with Oz Clark .
Being stereotypically British , I thought it looked perfect on him .
Chris Oakley , Dagenham I would like a T - shirt to wear to my yoga class .
I love this message .
Carroll Macdonald , Bridgewater , CT , US I saw this poster in a gift catalogue last year .
It 's on my mobile phone as the background wallpaper because I love the simplicity of the message and the visual design .
I think it sums up the British spirit in a crisis although some elements of the British press seem hellbent on whipping up hysteria about every event .
They could learn a lot from this message .

" Thanks to a chance discovery in a dusty box of books , the soothing entreaty is finally having its intended effect , bringing comfort to a nation in turmoil . "
Rubbish , it 's just a poster .
It does n't hide the fact that wages are being cut and jobs lost .
Socialism would bring comfort to all people , not nationalistic posters .

Am in the process of moving house and also soon to start a post graduate course .
This is something I need .
Jane , Manchester
I 've had this up in my front room for about a year and a half now .
The message is brilliant as it's basically a massive hiker 's style Do n't Panic message from the king .
It 's even in large friendly letters .
Jim Downing , Salisbury I saw this on a wall in one of our classrooms and I had no idea where it had come from though it sounded typically British .
It 's a shame it did n't get used for its intended purpose but it still holds a message for people in different situations today .
Abz , north east England I saw this poster and fell in love with it last year - it is now hanging proudly in my hallway as a message to me and my family as we go about our daily life - it's so British and after a year which included a redundancy , a house move and a bereavement it just seems fitting .
Also think the design is wonderful and love the way the colour and the wording clash - bright red to calm us down .
Fantastic .
