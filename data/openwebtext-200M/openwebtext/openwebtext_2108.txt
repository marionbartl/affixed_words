2. Obama needs to get out there door - to - door again , talk to the working poor , engage Reagan Democrats , explain his positions on the war , and the economy and healthcare , reiterate why he can get stuff done in a way that the polarizing psycho- drama of the Clintons cannot .
Save the great speeches for later .
More round - tables ; get on a bus ; show you can work as hard as she can .
Stop looking so aloof .
3. Forget about the delegate math .
Stop claiming you 've won already or that the Clintons cannot win .
Remember that your job is to win the argument about the future of the US and the world .
Make this campaign about your kind of politics rather than the Clinton - Bush style of politics .
This race will not be decided by a delegate count .
It will be decided by a collective decision about the better candidate some time in the next few months .
Math is not an argument ; it 's an analysis .
4 . Make a speech about the Internet slurs .
Stop ducking them .
Confront them .
Talk about your Christian faith and your childhood exposure to Islam .
Tell people about your parents .
Debunk that idiotic pledge of allegiance meme .
Grab the flag pin issue by the lapels .
Do it all at once undefensively .
Yes , it will raise the profile of every single slur .
But if you rebut them candidly , gracefully , calmly , you will defuse them .
You can run but you can't hide from Internet crapola .
So confront it ; defeat it .
Right now , on these issues alone , the Obama camp is actually captive to the politics of fear .
Do n't be .

US claims Iran behind rocket attacks on Baghdad 's Green Zone RAW STORY
Published : Monday March 24 , 2008
|
Print This Email This The U.S. military blamed Iranian - backed Shiite militia factions on Monday for a spate of rocket attacks that struck the Green Zone and surrounding areas , a day after the overall U.S. death toll in the five - year conflict rose to 4,000 .
The White House called the grim milestone " a sober [ sic ] moment " and said President Bush spends time every day thinking about those who have lost their lives in battle .
" He bears the responsibility for the decisions that he made , " White House press secretary Dana Perino said Monday .
" He also bears the responsibility to continue to focus on succeeding . "
The American deaths came Sunday , the same day rockets pounded the U.S. - protected Green Zone in Baghdad and a wave of attacks left at least 61 Iraqis dead nationwide .
Gen. David Petraeus , the top US military commander in Iraq , " said he has evidence that Iran was behind Sunday 's bombardment of Baghdad 's heavily fortified Green Zone , " the BBC reports , adding that Petraeus told the British news network that " he thought Tehran had trained , equipped and funded insurgents who fired the barrage of mortars and rockets . "
Story continues below the following video featuring Gen. Petraeus ...
Rear Adm. Gregory Smith , a U.S. military spokesman in Baghdad , said the rockets fired into the Green Zone , also known as the International Zone , were Iranian - made and supplied by the Quds Force , an elite unit of Iran 's Revolutionary Guards .
The U.S. military has accused Iran of arming and funding Shiite extremists to fight American forces in Iraq .
Iran denies the allegation .
U.S. Embassy spokesman Philip Reeker said two government employees  an American and a Jordanian  were seriously wounded and six other people required medical attention after Sunday 's volley of rocket attacks .
Local hospital and police officials said at least 12 Iraqis were killed and 30 more were wounded in rocket or mortar blasts that apparently fell short after being aimed at the Green Zone from scattered areas of eastern Baghdad .
" We have assessed the rockets fired yesterday into the International Zone and those that struck neighborhoods nearby , were the responsibility of Iranian - backed special groups , " Smith told The Associated Press in an e-mail .
The military uses the term special groups to refer to Shiite extremists who continue attacks despite a cease - fire order by radical Shiite cleric Muqtada al - Sadr to his Mahdi Army militia .
" The attacks show the indiscriminate violence these groups carry out in Iraq as the major loss of life yesterday was to innocent Iraqi men , women and children , " Smith said .
The deaths of four U.S. soldiers in a roadside bombing about 10 p.m. Sunday in southern Baghdad pushed to 4,000 the number of American service members killed as the war enters its sixth year .
Another soldier was wounded in the attack , the military said .
The AP count of 4,000 deaths is based on U.S. military reports and includes eight civilians who worked for the Department of Defense .
" You regret every casualty , every loss , " Vice President Dick Cheney said .
" The president is the one that has to make that decision to send young men and women into harm 's way .
It never gets any easier . "
An American military official in Baghdad said each U.S. death is " equally tragic " and underscored the need to keep up the fight .
" There have been some significant gains .
However , this enemy is resilient and will not give up , nor will we , " military spokesman Navy Lt. Patrick Evans said .
" There 's still a lot of work to be done . "
Last year , U.S. military deaths spiked as U.S. troops sought to regain control of Baghdad and surrounding areas .
The death toll has seesawed since , with 2007 ending as the deadliest year for American troops at 901 deaths .
That was 51 more deaths than 2004 , the second deadliest year for U.S. soldiers .
Tens of thousands of Iraqi civilians also have been killed since the U.S. - led invasion on March 20 , 2003 , although estimates of a specific figure vary widely because of the difficulty in collecting accurate information .
One widely respected tally by Iraq Body Count , which collects figures based mostly on media reports , estimates that 82,349 to 89,867 Iraqi civilians have lost their lives in the conflict .
Overall attacks also have decreased against Iraqi civilians but recent weeks have seen several high - profile bombings , highlighting the fragile security situation and the resilience of both Sunni and Shiite extremist groups .
The heavily fortified Green Zone has frequently come under fire by Shiite and Sunni extremists , but the attacks have tapered off as violence declined over the past year .
Sunday 's attacks followed a series of clashes last week between U.S. and Iraqi forces and factions of the Mahdi Army .
The Mahdi Army has come under severe strains in recent weeks as the U.S. and Iraqi forces insist on detaining followers they accuse of belonging to breakaway groups .
Al - Sadr 's followers have accused the Shiite - dominated government of exploiting the cease - fire to target the cleric 's supporters in advance of provincial elections expected this fall .
They have demanded the release of supporters rounded up in recent weeks .
Leaders of the Sadrist movement called on supporters to protest the arrests by closing their shops and businesses .
The call was heeded Monday in at least two predominantly Shiite neighborhoods of Baghdad .
AP Television News video showed a deserted bus stop , shuttered shops and empty streets in normally bustling Amil and Baiyaa .
Police said Mahdi Army militiamen have also issued general strike orders in three other areas of southwestern Baghdad and in Mahmoudiya , some 20 miles south of Baghdad .
" This civil disobedience may be called for in the rest of Baghdad and maybe in southern provinces if the government does not free our detainees , " Sadrist lawmaker Ali al - Mayali said after attending a leadership meeting Monday in the holy city of Najaf .
Liwa Smeism , a senior political adviser at al - Sadr 's office in Najaf , said the strikes in west Baghdad would continue for up to 48 hours unless the government meets the movement 's demands for the release of detainees and a stop to raids against the Sadrists .
Also Monday , Iraqi authorities clamped an indefinite nighttime curfew on the Shiite oil port of Basra as Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki traveled to the volatile southern city and ordered a new security plan in a bid to clamp down on violence between rival militia factions .
The move is a sign of growing concern about security in the nation 's oil capital since British forces handed over control of the city last year .
Meanwhile , the FBI said it has recovered the remains of two kidnapped U.S. contractors in Iraq .
The agency identified the contractors as Ronald Withrow of Roaring Springs , Texas , and John Roy Young of Kansas City , Mo. Withrow worked for JPI Worldwide when he was kidnapped in January 2007 .
Young worked for Crescent Security Group when he was kidnapped in November 2006 .
The FBI said the investigation into the kidnappings is ongoing .

In his op - ed in the Wall Street Journal today , Karl Rove remembers something that was done to John McCain in Vietnam :
Another McCain story , somewhat better known , is about the Vietnamese practice of torturing him by tying his head between his ankles with his arms behind him , and then leaving him for hours .
The torture so badly busted up his shoulders that to this day Mr. McCain can't raise his arms over his head .
One night , a Vietnamese guard loosened his bonds , returning at the end of his watch to tighten them again so no one would notice .
This is what is called a " stress position . "
It was authorized , monitored and practised as a torture technique by this president , whose chief adviser at the time was Karl Rove .
Rove even planned to run the 2006 Congressional campaign on the message of being tough enough on prisoners in American custody .
In the same op - ed , Rove refers warmly to McCain 's Bangladeshi adopted daughter - the same daughter his surrogates demonized in the 2000 campaign , by spreading rumors that McCain had a black illegitimate daughter .
Every now and again , one is shocked by the Big Lies and chutzpah that come out of a man as utterly indifferent to the truth as Rove .
And then one realizes : this is what these people do for a living .
They say anything to retain and wield power .

New College of California , a private liberal arts school in San Francisco , is at risk of losing its accreditation for academic and ethical violations .
School administrators , under pressure from faculty , students and the Western Association of Schools & Colleges , announced that they will form a committee to search for a new president and will reconfigure the board of directors .
New College , which emphasizes activism and social change , was put on probation July 5 by the association for violations found by the association 's commission .
The commission 's investigators found that :
-- Students had enrolled in and attended classes long before they were admitted to the college ;
-- Grades of incomplete were changed to letter grades by persons not assigned to teach the courses ;
-- Independent study was used improperly .
--
The college had insufficient financial reserves , controls and budgeting .
The association , which accredits colleges and universities in California , Hawaii and the western U.S. territories , will conduct an inspection this fall .
Based on that inspection , the association could choose to pull the school 's accreditation as soon as May .
Without accreditation , the school could not give federal and state financial aid to its students .
Although the college could remain open , degrees earned by its students would lose value .
New College President Martin Hamilton admits some of the allegations have merit but says the report is exaggerated , unfair and disrespectful to the school .
" It 's not like we are perfect , but many things were taken out of context , " said Hamilton , 57 , who has been at the school since 1977 and president for seven years .
He plans to step down as president next year .
Problems at the school have been simmering for a long time , students and faculty say , but seem to have escalated during the past year .
Some faculty and staff have resigned , and some students say they will boycott this semester or leave for good .
Most blame Hamilton and the school 's other top administrators for the problems .
This summer , in response to the commission 's findings , the full - time faculty issued a vote of no-confidence in Hamilton , and adjunct instructors formed a council .
Several students began organizing a group that would serve as students ' official voice .
The commission began its investigation in May after receiving six letters alleging misconduct .
It found " clear and egregious violations , " according to a letter detailing the findings .
Hamilton said he is working hard to remedy the complaints and hopes to see the school through its probation .
In response to the investigation , the school 's board of trustees announced Friday that it will increase the number of board members , form a presidential search committee and name an interim chief financial officer .
Commission investigators also found inadequate records on admissions , questionable handling of financial aid and scholarships , and a general " culture of administrative sloppiness and arbitrariness . "
" Our team was only there for a day , but what they found during that day raised very serious concerns , " said Ralph Wolff , president of the Senior College Commission of the Western Association of Schools & Colleges .
" There is a lot the college needs to do to demonstrate its integrity . "
Wolff said a special investigation is extremely rare .
Of 156 colleges covered by the association , only two are currently on probation : New College and San Diego Christian College .
One of the key findings is that Hamilton and those close to him make " unilateral assertions of authority . "
Harry Britt , a former San Francisco supervisor who has been on the faculty since 1992 , said the school is run by " a small group of people who are very highly motivated by the white male experience of the 1960s . "
" There is rhetoric about love and community and trust , but in reality , it is an unhealthy situation because of the abusive and unwelcoming power situated at the top , " Britt said .
The commission also said the school does not have stable revenues , sufficient financial reserves , effective financial controls or effective financial budgeting and planning .
The schools money woes worsened after the purchase last year of the Roxie Theater , for the school 's media and film studies program , and the Casa Loma Hotel , for student housing .
Hamilton , who said he earns $ 75,000 a year as president , admits the school is struggling financially .
He also said that there has been a fair amount of staff turnover and that the school has money problems and clunky software , but he thinks he can clean it up .
" Our greatest concern right now is how to balance the budget , " he said .
Investigators said they have " serious doubts that the same board and executive leadership that have allowed the problems are now capable of remedying these serious and pervasive matters . "
Headquartered in a pink and green building at Valencia and 19th streets in the Mission District , the campus has both graduate and undergraduate degree programs .
It also has a law school and a teaching credential program , each of which has separate accreditations .
New College is known for its progressive faculty , one - on - one mentoring and the infusion of critical thinking , self - expression , activism and spirituality into the curriculum .
It bills itself as committed to education in support of a " just , sacred and sustainable world " and does a large amount of outreach in both local and global communities .
The threat of losing accreditation has some in a panic .
Jacob Ingersoll moved to San Francisco from Michigan last year for the master 's program in Activism and Social Change .
The 25 - year - old said he noticed from the beginning that things were loose - classes scheduled at the last minute , late financial aid and lax policies .
" I was willing to let it slide .
Those are little problems , " he said .
But then the directors of his department resigned , and he began to learn of deeper issues within the school .
" There was no faculty grievance policy , and none for students either , " said Ingersoll , who will enroll at City College of San Francisco while he figures out where to continue his graduate studies .
" I was not expecting this at all . "
Several students are starting a council they hope can help save the school .
Jeremy Zimmer , 26 , a commuter student from San Jose , said the Interim Independent Student Council is working on a charter .
" There is a long history of failed attempts at student organizing , and we saw the report as an opportunity to initiate a student council , " Zimmer said .
" The administration has been incredibly resistant and even hostile to such an idea . "
Zimmer started at the college in the fall of 2005 and is close to completing his degree .
But he said he will take a leave of absence in solidarity with the teachers who resigned and the students who quit his program .
" I do n't feel comfortable being there and giving them money until we see some serious progress , " he said .
" We are concerned they will not take this seriously and make superficial changes and shuffle people around while the power remains in a close - knit group . "
The student council reiterated a call by the Adjunct Council for new leadership and the replacement of the president , academic vice presidents and the 12 - member board of trustees .
Some students and faculty say those who are complaining lack perspective .
" A lot of times we are holding things together by a thread , but we are doing amazing work and have so many incredible teachers , " said Sudia Paloma McCaleb , who runs the teaching program .
" We have a challenge to keep progressive education alive and should n't focus our activism on destroying a college . "
Gregory Gajus , a part - time humanities teacher who is serving as spokesman for the newly formed , 30 - member Adjunct Council , said he sees hope in the commission 's letter .
" It mirrors the reality of the school , " he said .
" It is consistent with what we see .
We have been wanting to see change for a long time and felt powerless .
Now , we are excited because it validates so many things we have known . "

There is no other office on earth that can captivate us like the presidency of the United States .
The 2008 candidates have given us an entire season of debates so we know the fine points of the differences between them .
While the average civics teacher will tell you that Americans do not appreciate their national political heritage nearly enough , it is all too clear that the typical American is not only captivated with the presidency during election season , but has lifted the president to the stature of mythical hero .
It is this awe for the presidency that has allowed presidents from Washington to Bush to exercise powers never allowed to them under the Constitution .
Many of the abuses of the power of the presidency are derived from the president 's role as commander - in - chief , a position that was designed to accommodate Washington , a military general .
It is the combination of president and commander - chief that , in the minds of many Americans , lifts the holder of the office to archetypal or mythical status .
The president of the United States has far more power than any office in the history of humanity , powers reminiscent of those of the Greek superhero Hercules or the Sumerian king Gilgamesh .
The current president claims the right to detain , torture and kill anyone on earth and to initiate wars and occupations in any nation of his choice without approval from any people or country .
The president claims the right to levy taxes at will , seize anything , prohibit anything , mandate anything , spy on anyone , and require all jurisdictions to bend to his will .
Although his power to alter reality is limited by the economic realities of the country , the holocaustic power of the modern presidency extends to the nuclear weapons within his reach .
It does n't matter who the president is .
The end result of the presidency is almost always the loss of many lives through war .
Even the best presidents violated the Bill of Rights , instituted regressive taxation , engaged in detrimental foreign diplomacy , and increased intrusive police powers .
The worst presidents rank among the greatest political criminals in the annals of history .
Yet most Americans hold fast to their heroic image .
It 's just a matter of which would - be tyrant in swashbuckler 's clothing should get the job .
Could the power of the president be retrenched ?
Ron Paul 's failed presidential bid showed us that a politician can facilitate big steps toward liberty only to the extent that he is supported by public opinion .
As he has acknowledged , it is only a classical liberal culture , not great individuals standing alone , that makes a society free .
This classical liberal culture would be one composed of grown up individuals who have achieved freedom in the classical existential manner , by accepting total responsibility for themselves .
This kind of individual is his own superhero .
So , ironically , even the president does not have the power to bring down the modern presidency , whose powers are of epic proportion and greater than any single human who might occupy that office .
Presidential power is a reflection of the collective national political climate , as well as the collective national consciousness that worships presidential supremacy .
Even now , in a time when presidential approval ratings are close to all time lows , no one wants to give it up .
Consider the current lot of candidates , McCain , Obama , and Clinton .
All say they stand for change , yet all three want to uphold the infrastructure of the imperial presidency .
Each is tied to the Council on Foreign Relations , committed to the North American Union and the New World Order .
These are modern day epic characters whose agenda's are no different in proportion than the great Herculean feats .
Each candidate wants to greatly expand the presidency in one way or another .
Each represents an archetype .
All are master politicians adept at telling us what we want to hear .
And their campaigns give us what we long for most in a president  someone to make us feel warm and fuzzy about being Americans .
Modern politicians get votes not so much based on their political stances , but on how they make people feel about America .
When Americans like the president , they also tend to think more highly of the presidency .
They want more from their government , and are less bothered when it commits great wrongs .
But this all encompassing pride in the presidency is what has allowed it to become the nations ' master and a giant menace to the rest of the world .
It is unfortunate that Americans project onto the presidency the responsibility for providing them with cultural identity , patriotism , and self - respect .
These are characteristics the truly free individual is able to provide for himself .
In his article , Anthony Gregory views the presidency as too powerful , inherently corrupting , and inhumanely destructive .
In his view , " The presidency as it supposedly should be , under the Constitution , is a relatively humble office overseeing the executive branch , one of the three composing a radically restrained government with very limited enumerated powers .
Today , the presidency overshadows the other branches , the states , and all Constitutional and statutory limits on its power .
" How did it get to the point that 300 million people , and to a great extent the rest of the world , have to live under the rule of one all - powerful official ?
Is it our wish to remain in a childlike state relying on a figure endowed with epic powers to take care of us ?
Is it for this that we are willing to sacrifice our freedom as individuals ?
Ron Paul 's campaign was the closest in modern electoral history to being a campaign against the omnipotent presidency itself .
His message to us was to grow up and take responsibility for our own lives and freedom , healing ourselves of the need for the mighty superhero to take care of us .
But we have chosen instead , as Gregory puts it " to love and celebrate the presidency , looking to it as savior , moral guardian for the nation , stabilizer of the economy , provider of goods and necessities , protector against evil and liberator of the world . "
We have chosen to remain in the state of childhood , reveling in the adventures of our superheros .

Christopher Ratte , professor in the department of classics at the University of Michigan , was recently turned into a jailbird and had his son taken away from him , all in the name of protecting the child from the father .
He had taken his 7 - year - old son to a baseball game in Detroit and ordered him lemonade .
What was served up was a “ Mike ’s Hard Lemonade , ” which his son prepared to drink .
Suddenly security arrived .
“ You know this is an alcoholic beverage ? ” the security guard asked .
“ You have got to be kidding , ” responded the professor .
And before the professor could examine the bottle , the guard snatched it away , and the boy was taken to the hospital where no traces of alcohol were found in him .
The boy was then promptly put in foster care .
It was two days before the mother , a professor of architecture , was allowed to take him home , and a full week before the father was allowed to come back into the home again .
The case provides a remarkable look at the workings of bureaucracy .
The Detroit Free Press interviewed all the people involved .
It turns out that no one was happy about what happened , but the gears of the bureaucracy ground away , ruining peoples ’ lives for no good reason .
The cop on duty thought it was a mistake , but his supervisor was insisting that he act .
When Child Protective Services came to take the child away into their cruel foster care , the police objected .
But CPS was just doing its duty .
It had no choice but to take the child since the police had requested a court order — also triggered by events — to remove the child .
Observers who know the system say that the only surprising aspect to this case is that child was returned so quickly .
Had the couple been poor , uneducated , and unconnected , the case might still be tied up in the courts .
The lesson many people draw from this is that social workers are being given too much authority , that governments need to be reformed so that they do not take extreme measures too hastily , that cops need to use good sense before busting up families , etc .
The problem is that all of these reforms ultimately depend on the state to use its discretionary power judiciously .
The real issue concerns the locus of control .
Does it belong to the family or the state ?
When there is a dispute , to whom does the presumption of innocence belong ?
It is not enough to say : here is a bad family environment , so of course the state should control the outcome .
When it comes to the power of the state over the family , there is no such thing as a judicious use .
The state has every reason to invent reasons to destroy families — and all other independent centers of authority — and the families themselves have no choice but to crawl and beg .
State campaigns for the welfare of children have always been a major justification for the expansion of leviathan .
This is the primary basis for the war on drugs , which has robbed us of so many civil liberties .
It is the basis for the nationalization of education that is taking place , administration by administration , in the name of preventing any child from being left behind .
If the internet is ever regulated in the US the way it is in China and parts of Europe , it will be in the name of protecting the children .
Indeed , it is possible to erect a totalitarian state in the name of helping the children .
So it was in Texas , when the state swept in to remove 437 children from their mothers .
The police were responding to a call claiming abuse , but there was no other basis for this incredible action than the desire to crush a religion completely .
The state decided the dissident church should n’t exist , and so it claimed all power in the interest of the children .
The state could count on sympathy from mainstream American culture , which rightly disapproves of polygamy and underage marriages .
And that is precisely why the group separated themselves completely from the rest of the culture .
See if you can watch this video of mothers speaking out against the action and not conclude that the case for the invasion was at best ambiguous .
Should people be free to set up cults , to live undisturbed to practice their religion , to deviate from mainstream ethical codes ?
Certainly if we believe in freedom , people should be able to do this .
In fact , the group was already under a great deal of pressure to reform from the outside and inside , with former members of the group reporting despotic control by the leader and many men who had been excommunicated putting pressure on those inside to leave .
We do n’t know whether the entire matter — if indeed abuse was taking place — might have been handled in this way , because the state intervened to impose the cruelest possible solution : namely , taking children from their mothers ’ arms and putting them in the hands of government social workers .
In the name of protecting children , the state already runs a huge program with government officials posing as teenagers seeking sex and arresting those who fall for the scam .
By itself , this is very strange , with government becoming a source for the very problem that government is trying to correct .
Meanwhile , a Feb - March 2008 report from the American Psychologist reports that the fears about internet predation are wildly exaggerated and do not reflect the facts .
This is hardly a surprise , since the state has incentive to exaggerate the pathologies of society as a means of getting a clawhold over every independent sector .
The goal of the state is to find some practice that is universally reviled and pose as the one and only way of expunging it from society .
The best example today is child pornography , a grim and ghastly industry that every decent person would like to see eradicated from the earth .
But in the name of doing so , the state invades everyone ’s privacy , controls speech , interferes with families , and otherwise uses the issue as a wedge to undermine every freedom .
Thus do we see what is wrong with statements such as the following : “ We have an obligation to protect children from sexual exploitation and abuse , and we can do this by increasing communication between state and federal agencies to help combat this repulsive industry .
While privacy rights should always be respected in the pursuit of child pornographers , more needs to be done to track down and prosecute the twisted individuals who exploit innocent children . ”
Do we really want to unleash the state to solve this problem ?
Not if we understand the dynamics of statism .
The power will not be used to solve the problem , but rather to intimidate the population in ways to which people will find it difficult to object .
The trouble is that the above words were not written by the typically naïve do - gooder , social worker , or Justice Department bureaucrat .
They were penned by spokesmen for the Libertarian Party .

In addition to being a mild - mannered economist by day , I am an avid fan of gambling and all its devices .
( Though since I still am the property of student lender Sallie Mae , I have been a mere spectator of the gambling world for the last several years . )
I am here to inform Ron Paul fans that " the market " — the gambling website Intrade.com — says his chances of winning the GOP nomination are now 6.1 % .
In contrast , McCain ’s chances are 5.4 % , and Huckabee ’s a meager 3.2 % .
Beyond the fact that Ron Paul is now in 4th place — and being ahead of McCain , is now surely a " real " candidate — is his meteoric rise since late May .
Just look at this chart from Intrade :
To make sense of all this , let me briefly explain how Intrade works .
It is fashioned after a futures market ( such as in oil or pork bellies ) , where participants can buy or sell contracts contingent on future events .
Now in the case of the " 2008.GOP.NOM .PAUL " contract , the buyer ( as of October 2 ) pays $ 6.10 for a contract entitling him to a $ 100 payoff if Ron Paul gets the Republican nomination .
In contrast , the seller of this contract receives $ 6.10 , but might have to pay out the $ 100 if Paul gets the nomination .
Obviously , if Ron Paul does n’t get nominated , then the buyer of the contract gets nothing — he ’s out his $ 6.10 — and the seller gets to pocket the $ 6.10 .
There are imperfections due to transaction costs and other frictions , but the probabilities of all the possible outcomes should sum ( close to ) 100 % , because otherwise there would be pure arbitrage opportunities .
For example , if the sum of the contract prices totaled only $ 98 , then someone could buy one of each , and be guaranteed a profit of $ 2 ( since one of the contracts would " hit " ) .
On the other hand , if the contracts summed to $ 103 , then someone could sell one of each , earning $ 103 , and then only have to pay out $ 100 when one of them hit — thus netting a guaranteed profit of $ 3 .
So generally speaking , the contract prices should all sum to $ 100 .
Of course , people with inside information stand to profit by trading in this market .
If a technician at a health clinic comes across a very disturbing heart exam for McCain , that person could rush out and sell contracts on McCain ’s nomination — and thereby push down the price of a McCain contract .
On the other hand , if a Romney campaign staffer learned that Mitt was going to receive an honorary degree from a university , he could rush to buy contracts on his candidate , and thereby push up their price .
It ’s because of the arbitrage element , and the fact that people with inside information can trade on it , that leads economists to loosely say that " the market " assigns a probability of ( right now ) 6.1 % to a Ron Paul nomination .
Sure , there are all sorts of objections you could raise to that type of talk ; some purists reject the very idea of statistical language in the arena of politics .
But you get the idea .
Before closing , let me stress two final points .
First , this is n’t some Podunk contract that four hicks ( who like to spam Fox voting schemes ) are trading back and forth .
No , when last I checked , the volume was over 63,000 Ron Paul contracts being transacted .
( So if this is manipulation , it ’s very very expensive . )
Second , some readers might be thinking , " Big deal !
Ron ’s gotten much higher than 6.1 % in various straw polls and other surveys . "
But that ’s just the thing , folks , and why I ’m so excited about this .
The Intrade contract is n’t asking , " Which candidate do you want to be nominated ? "
It ’s asking , " Which candidate do you predict will be nominated ? "
And I think it ’s incredibly encouraging — for lovers of liberty , that is — that Ron Paul has broken through the 6 % mark , and is now in 4th place .
The great thing is , the three front - runners are only a gaffe away from forfeiting their position , just as McCain did with his immigration photo op with Ted Kennedy .
In contrast , everybody already knows what Ron Paul stands for ; he does n’t need to delicately protect his carefully scripted image .
The pundits are still dismissing Ron Paul as a fringe candidate who is n’t " serious . "
Well , there ’s a lot of actual money on the table saying that he is indeed a contender for the GOP nomination .

Hiring leaps in public sector
First - quarter gain most since 2002
Federal , state and local governments are hiring new workers at the fastest pace in six years , helping offset job losses in the private sector .
Governments added 76,800 jobs in the first three months of 2008 , the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports .
That 's the biggest jump in first - quarter hiring since a boom in 2002 that followed the 9/11 terrorist attacks .
By contrast , private companies collectively shed 286,000 workers in the first three months of 2008 .
That job loss has led many economists to declare the country is in a recession .
Job numbers for April , out Friday , will show if the trend is continuing .
Some economists say a government hiring binge could soften a recession in the short term .
" Government jobs are an important cushion for the economy when the private sector falters , " says North Carolina State University economist Michael Walden .
But the job expansion could later cause financial problems for governments that are spending too much .
" More hiring has nothing to do with good government or economic policy , " says economist Kenneth Brown , research director at the Rio Grande Foundation in Albuquerque .
" It has everything to do with government being slow to react to economic change . "
Government hiring began to boom last year around July 1 , when most state and local governments started new fiscal years .
Those budgets were based on forecasts established in a strong economy .
In each quarter since , the total government workforce has been the most in at least six years .
State and local governments have run deficits for the last nine months , the Commerce Department reports .
Tax collections went flat in the middle of 2007 , but spending has continued to rise .
The USA has nearly 88,000 units of government , mostly local , that employ 22 million .
Hiring has been strong at every level , from new CIA spies to preschool teachers .
Some of what 's happening :
• The federal government increased its workforce by 13,800 in the first three months of 2008 .
Local governments added 47,000 and states 16,000 .
• The Rochester , N.Y. , school system added 289 teachers while the school population shrank by 1,300 students .
It 's part of a state - funded effort to reduce class size .
New York City is adding 1,300 teachers .
Florida and Texas are also hiring to reduce class size .
• The Texas city of Weatherford ( pop. 25,000 ) added an assistant city manager , nine firefighters , three police officers and extra crews for roads and parks .
" We have serious infrastructure issues that we need to get a handle on , " City Manager Jennifer Fadden says .
Some states may cut hiring to save money .
Governors have announced hiring freezes in California , Delaware , Louisiana , Massachusetts , New Hampshire , New Jersey and New York , but the actions seldom trim total employment .
Louisiana has hired 4,100 workers , mostly replacements , since a freeze began in January .

“ In the old system — board elevator , press button — you have an illusion of control ; elevator manufacturers have sought to trick the passengers into thinking they ’re driving the conveyance .
In most elevators , at least in any built or installed since the early nineties , the door - close button does n’t work .
It is there mainly to make you think it works .
( It does work if , say , a fireman needs to take control .
But you need a key , and a fire , to do that . )
Once you know this , it can be illuminating to watch people compulsively press the door - close button .
That the door eventually closes reinforces their belief in the button ’s power .
It ’s a little like prayer .
Elevator design is rooted in deception — to disguise not only the bare fact of the box hanging by ropes but also the tethering of tenants to a system over which they have no command .
” Talk about fooling most of the people most of the time !
Of course , superstition is actually a well - known phenomenon in the animal world .
Experiments with rats have shown that if you give them a reward ( say , food ) , shortly after they accidentally bumped their shoulder against a wall of their cage , they will start purposely bumping against the wall , expecting a new reward .
This is no different from human beings associating a win by their favorite team to them wearing a “ lucky ” shirt or hat .
Both are examples of a widespread logical fallacy ( after that , therefore because of that ) , where a causal link between two events is inferred on the basis of an observed correlation .
The difference between rats and humans is that the former give up their illogical behavior much sooner than the latter , if no further reward is coming .
( Of course , what makes the elevator such a Machiavellian device is that the rewardkeep coming ! )
More generally , superstition ( and therefore religious belief , which is a form of superstition ) can likely be traced back to two factors , one of which seems to apply only to humans and perhaps other closely related primates .
The first factor is exemplified in the widespread use of observational correlations in the animal kingdom : it simply makes sense for natural selection to favor the ability to uncover potentially significant patterns in the environment , so that the organism can take advantage of them .
However , one would also expect selection to favor the quick abandonment of pattern - based behavior if the pattern turns out not to be a reliable clue for action -- exactly what happens with rats .
The second factor applies only to animals with a sufficient sense of self that they develop a need to be consciously in control of their lives : human beings first and foremost .
This need for control is in fact so strong that we project agency onto the natural world and invent gods so that we can then pray to elicit favors from them .
Or we keep pushing the elevator button even though it does n’t do anything , smiling with a satisfied smugness once the doors finally do close -- even if they would have done so regardless of our pointless actions .
Today ’s Rocky Mountain
News prints a very misleading letter from Tomi-Ann Roberts , Professor of Psychology and Director of the Program in Feminist and Gender Studies program at Colorado College .
The paper headlined her letter “ SPEAKOUT : Feminists at CC seek dialogue . ”
See below for my detailed responses to Roberts ’s letter and for the simultaneous response from Vincent Carroll , editor of the paper ’s editorial pages .
I thought I would join the dialogue rather than speak merely as an outsider , so I requested to join the Feminist and Gender Studies listserv .
Here ’s the response I got from Roberts :
You have requested to join the Colorado College Feminist and Gender Studies Listserv .
We ’d prefer not to have someone from an organization that has maligned , demonized , and belittled us join our group .
Please find another group of feminists to haunt .
Leave us alone , thank you .
For the record , I do not believe that I have maligned , demonized , or belittled the program at any time .
Other than the publication of “ The Monthly Rag ” by its interns , the porn star event , and the listserv itself , I do n’t know what the program does , and the program is free ( and should be free ) to engage in whatever activism and programming they like , including events with porn stars .
But certainly I have severely criticized and ridiculed ( but have not demonized or belittled , and “ maligned ” seems too strong ) Colorado College and individual administrators and others who have acted shamefully in the case of “ The Monthly Bag ” ( issue 2 is here ) , censoring the publication and subjecting the authors to a three - hour trial in a kangaroo court before finding them guilty of “ violence ” for putting up a parody .
( By the way , there is a recording of the trial , and should this case one day go to court , everyone would be able to hear what really happened . )
One of those administrators deserving criticism is Roberts herself .
Another is Ginger Morgan , Associate Dean of Students for Academic Support .
Here ’s what Morgan sent to the Feminist and Gender Studies student listserv :
Sent : Mon 3/3/2008 To : FGSSTUDENTS -L Mailing List Subject : Update Student conduct complaint Update : hearing now looks to be slated for Monday afternoon starting at 1 .
Statements will need to be received by Friday at noon via email to [ REDACTED ] .
Feel free to contact me with questions .
Ginger
As I trust many or most of you are aware , the responsible parties for the “ Monthly Bag ” came forward after the FLASH on Friday .
Jeff [ link added ] is hoping the Student Conduct hearing will convene this upcoming Friday ( likely starting at 1 until concluded ) prior to Spring Break .
Any person who would like to speak to the impact the Monthly Bag had on them is welcome to submit statements .
We are shooting for optimal number of four who would also be willing to appear before the Student Conduct Committee .
There are several students ( and maybe staff ) the respondents will bring who can be expected to say “ it was meant to be funny ” “ no harm done ” “ free speech / slippery slope ” “ the Monthly Rag is just as offensive ” …
I am willing to serve as a complainant and come to the hearing .
I also think it is important for the students involved to hear from peers as well as perhaps some faculty about why this was upsetting .
I would direct folks ’ attention to the Pathfinder ( also available online for those of you who did not keep the copies provided to you … ) pages 27 - 30 where our community values are explicitly spelled out .
That said , I think that the most impactful statements will be personal and not necessary in institution speak …
I am willing to serve to coordinate the complainants , though do not feel I must be at the center of this .
Any complainant may contact Jeff Cathey directly with a statement or questions .
I am also available to be useful in whatever way this evolving situation warrants .
Um , this was all about fear of violence , right ?
That ’s what President Celeste said in his blog ( contradicting what he said at first . )
Where ’s that ?
Now , for Dr. Roberts ’s letter :
I would like to address several errors in recent media coverage of the controversial publication of a satirical flier at Colorado College , and present some perspective from the college ’s Feminist and Gender Studies Program .
Our program ’s bathroom publication , the Monthly Rag , is itself something of a parody , if you note its title , which emphasizes the idea of women being “ on the rag . ”
It is meant as a playful , informational flier regarding “ taboo ” subjects related to women ’s bodies and sexuality .
It is one of several bathroom fliers sponsored by groups on campus .
In the issue that was taken down in many bathrooms
According to the authors of the Bag , they did not take any flyers down , and they preferred to see the Rag posted so that their parody of the Rag would be more powerful .
Actually , the Bag flyers were the ones immediately taken down .
[ A] nd replaced with the Monthly Bag , our flier has a point of historical fact with “ Did You Know ” as its heading .
In it the term vagina dentata is explained .
( The vagina dentata , or “ toothed vagina , ” appears in the myths of many cultures , representing castration fears . )
Contrast this to the Monthly Bag ’s own “ Did You Know . ”
There , the point of educational fact is : “ The Barrett .50 - caliber sniper rifle has an effective range of 2,000 meters . ”
These two “ Did You Know ” segments are decidedly not equivalent .
I daresay that speaking freely on these matters in public forums would get you different “ punishments ” indeed .
Say , for example , the Bag writers were in an airport , and they spoke out loud about the vagina dentata .
They might get some disgusted looks from other passengers .
Some might even tell them to shut up .
But let ’s say they spoke out loud in the airport about the range of a .50 - caliber sniper rifle .
They ’d be taken out by security .
This is , of course , a ludicrous and false analogy .
The context of speech makes a huge difference .
Roberts is a psychologist ; of course she knows that context matters .
The Supreme Court has held that an airport is not a public forum .
Having a gun magazine in an airport or even on board an airplane , and discussing details about guns while walking through the airport , is perfectly well protected .
( Just do n’t imply that you have a gun anyplace where guns are not allowed . )
Hunters and professional snipers ( such as those who protect heads of state from afar ) are free to discuss whatever weaponry they like , even in an airport .
Roberts even takes the information about a sniper rifle out of its context in the flyer itself .
The media claim the Bag authors , Chris Robinson and his unnamed associate , were subjected to a punishment .
Untrue .
Actually , it is quite true .
See here and here and the details here .
As I ’ve said before : “ The students were sanctioned and punished .
Take a look at their letter of sanction by Dean of Students Mike Edmonds .
Having a guilty finding on one ’s record is a punishment .
Having the letter put in each student ’s file is a punishment .
Being required to hold a “ forum ” is a punishment . ”
My understanding of the word punishment is that it ’s inflicted on someone , and it either hurts – physically or mentally – or it removes privileges .
The outcome of the Student Conduct Committee “ inquisition ” was that the authors of the Bag were not punished by the college .
Again , see here for some real definitions of what a sanction is and what a punishment is .
They were given a suggestion that they dialogue with the campus community about their strong feelings around masculinity , feminism and gender that led them to post the Bag in the first place .
Not a commandment to do so , but a suggestion , which they were free not to take .
False .
They were required to hold a forum on a specific topic by a specific date as punishment for being found guilty of “ violence . ”
If you post an anonymous , hostile parody of a publication intended to educate about the experiences of a historically marginalized group , then get ready for folks to fight back .
Here is a good place to excerpt Carroll ’s response in the Rocky Mountain News ( as advertised in my opening paragraph ) :
[ Roberts ] is too busy building her case that the satiric flier was a “ hostile ” voice - which it was not , and which you can verify by reviewing it and the publication it parodied … [ links added ]
Roberts makes two remarkable claims .
First , she denies that the students “ were subjected to a punishment ” for exercising their First Amendment rights .
She manages this feat by failing to note that the dean of students found the two young men guilty of “ violating the student code of conduct policy on violence under the college value of Respect . ”
This alarming but baseless finding goes into their files , I was told by an associate dean .
More to the point , the process itself was the punishment : being hauled before a “ conduct board ” to be grilled for more than three hours on the students ’ personal beliefs and attitudes , fearing that a wrong answer risked possible expulsion .
As political science professor David Hendrickson complained in the student newspaper , “ This entire procedure was in fact an atrocious invasion of the most elementary personal rights .
I do not know of any system of jurisprudence in the modern world that would give a formal sanction to this miscellany of unguided missiles directed at the supposed perpetrators . ” …
Why , perish the thought that this witch hunt had anything to do with the fact that the satire ’s targets were hypersensitive , radical activists determined , by Roberts ’ own admission , “ to fight back . ”
Of course not !
Roberts continues :
What we want is dialogue .
That ’s not what the Bag was .
Actually , the parody certainly was a contribution to campus dialogue , as its effects have endlessly proven .
In fact , Roberts herself has furthered the constructive part of the dialogue by circulating information in response to the Dudes ’ comment challenging the “ glass ceiling ” on women ’s salaries .
A community has the right to ask its members to take ownership of their opinions and to share them in a way that is respectful of others .
No idea at CC has been “ banned or forbidden , ” as Robinson claims .
False .
See what President Celeste originally wrote about why he deemed the content of the Bag unacceptable at Colorado College .
Any idea that is perceived as “ demeaning , ” Celeste said , “ is categorically unacceptable in this community . ”
All he and his friend have been asked to do is take responsibility for their ideas , and be brave enough to allow others to disagree with them .
False .
They also were required to go to a three - hour “ Star Chamber ” trial with a possible penalty of expulsion , and then , having been found guilty , were required to hold a campus forum about the issues raised by the Bag .
Why is the Feminist and Gender Studies Program being held responsible for this debacle ?
See the email above , for one reason among many , from Ginger Morgan .
The Rocky ’s Vincent Carroll writes that the problem with the Monthly Bag is “ who it offends .
It commits the mortal sin of poking fun at the work of activists associated with the Feminist and Gender Studies program ” ( “ CC ’s free - speech fears , ” On Point , April 8 ) . [ link added ]
Excuse me , Mr. Carroll , but did you ask any feminists if they were offended ?
No .
The response by CC President Richard Celeste and the decision to put the incident through the Student Conduct process were ones that were made entirely outside of our program .
In fact , many of us disagreed with the conduct process as the appropriate way to handle it .
This point is worth noting .
From the sentence it is unclear whether Roberts herself was one of those who disagreed .
But guilt by association is often a problem .
Just because so many of the critics ( if not also some of the judges ) came from the program , and just because the program ’s listservs were used to drum up outrage and support against the Bag , and just because Roberts ( the program ’s director ) has been so vociferous against the Bag , does not mean that everyone in the program feels the same as folks like Ginger Morgan .
If anyone associated with the Feminist and Gender Studies Program has left the group because of these incidents , I would like to know about it .
( Email me at adam@thefire.org . )
Most of us wanted to take the opportunity to open up a campuswide dialogue about why some white men feel silenced ; why our publication offends some ; or what gendered experience is about in a “ post - feminist ” world .
That ’s not how things went down .
But it is certainly not the fault of anyone in or associated with the Feminist and Gender Studies Program .
We still invite Robinson and anyone else who would like to talk openly about these matters , to do so with us .
False .
I again quote today ’s email from Roberts :
We ’d prefer not to have someone from an organization that has maligned , demonized , and belittled us join our group .
Please find another group of feminists to haunt .
Leave us alone , thank you .
Finally , here is Roberts ’s conclusion :
But please stop fabricating a story about humorless , offended feminists silencing men ’s free speech .
Stop using us as the scapegoat for a mean - spirited “ freedom - quest . ”
“ Mean - spirited ‘ freedom - quest ' ” ?
Indeed , who needs freedom after all ?
I close with these excerpts from Amanda Udis - Kessler , Colorado College ’s Director of Institutional Research and Planning , in her letter to the Colorado Springs Gazette :
Freedom , while important , is meaningless without respect for other people .
We do not have to agree with their ideas or even necessarily respect their ideas .
We must , however , treat them as we would wish to be treated ….
Name - calling and blackface are disrespectful because they are tied to a history of problematic treatment that includes violence and demeaning language , among other kinds of inequality .
For feminists , the Monthly Bag fits this pattern …
Social inequality is deeply grounded in a lack of respect - for women , people of color , lesbian and gay people , and others .
When we choose to curtail our freedom to disrespect others in order to build a meaningful society , we have made a mature and wise choice - and one that college should help us learn .
Wow !
The terribly low respect for free expression by Udis - Kessler is yet another reason for Colorado College to feel very , very ashamed .
Dialogue sometimes feels a bit disrespectful ; it ’s a hazard of vigorous debate .
Adults in college are strong enough to take it , but maybe that ’s not true at Colorado College .

It 's not being reported in the corporate media , which also refused to publish an opinion piece penned by six - term Rep. Robert Wexler ( D - FL ) , Rep. Luis Gutierrez ( D - IL ) , and Rep. Tammy Baldwin ( D - WI ) .
But a whopping 50,000 people responded in just one day to Rep .
Wexler 's call for people to sign his on - line petition supporting an immediate start to hearings on Rep. Dennis Kucinich 's Cheney Impeachment bill ( H Res 799 )
As of Sunday morning , 54,000 people had signed the petition at WexlerWantsHearings.com calling for action now .
And names are being added at a rate of one every one or two seconds !
Wexler has said he wanted at least 50,000 signatures .
But why stop there ?
If people get behind this , and if the impeachment movement spreads the word , he could easily get closer to 500,000 signatures over the next few days .
And if each of us were to send out a call to sign to ten of our friends , then we'd have half a million signatures , which would be hard for Conyers and the Democratic leadership , Speaker Nancy Pelosi included , to ignore .
So let 's do it !
Go to WexlerWantsHearings.com and sign the petition !
Kucinich 's impeachment bill was filed on April 24 and has been ignored now for almost eight shameful months .
On Nov. 7 , a bipartisan majority of 218 members of the House voted to send it from the floor of the House back to the Judiciary Committee for action .
Now it 's sat there for over four weeks .
We need to tell Congress , and particularly the Democrats who are stalling on this important defense of the Constitution and of democracy itself that time 's up .
We the American People want action .
We want impeachment hearings !
More than 100 motorists were arrested on suspicion of drink driving each day over the Easter weekend .
Assistant Garda Commissioner Eddie Rock said that between the St Patrick Day and Easter weekends some 1,100 people were stopped because of possible drink driving offences .
He said that the number of fatalities on the road had been reduced .
He also said there had been increased Garda enforcement which had a positive knock - on effect in clamping down on criminal gangs .
The i-Snake may sound like a cheap iPod peripheral , but it is actually the name of a revolutionary concept surgical robot , which hopes to advance keyhole surgery significantly .
A team at Imperial College , London , has been awarded a 2.1 million ( $ 4.2 million ) grant to work on the device , which will be an elongated tube with a series of motors , sensors and imaging tools .
Advertisement
The boffins are confident the robot will be able to aid in general laparoscopic surgery , but the researchers are intending its use to be specially designed for heart bypass operations .
The benefits of such procedures against traditional surgery are numerous ; patients have a reduced recovery time and incisions are rarely sizable .
Given the miniscule scale in which the i-Snake needs to function , it will be quite a feat to have a working model that packs in all the desired features , but if anyone can do it , a team of leading researchers with $ 4.2 million are probably the best chaps for the challenge .
[ BBC News ]
Since I began touring with my book The Shock Doctrine , I have had a number of exchanges like this , revolving around the same basic question : when hard - right political leaders and their advisers apply brutal economic shock therapy , do they honestly believe the trickle - down effects will build equitable societies - or are they just deliberately creating the conditions for yet another corporate feeding frenzy ?
Put bluntly : has the world been transformed over the past three decades by lofty ideology or by lowly greed ?
A definitive answer would require reading the minds of men such as Dick Cheney and Paul Bremer , so I tend to dodge .
The ideology in question holds that self - interest is the engine that drives society to its greatest heights .
Is n't pursuing their own self - interest ( and that of their campaign donors ) compatible with that philosophy ?
That 's the beauty : they do n't have to choose .
Unfortunately , this rarely satisfies graduate students looking for deeper meaning .
Thankfully , I now have a new escape hatch : quoting Alan Greenspan .
His autobiography , The Age of Turbulence , has been marketed as a mystery solved .
The man who bit his tongue for 18 years as head of the Federal Reserve was finally going to tell the world what he believed .
And Greenspan has delivered , using his book and the surrounding publicity as a platform for his " libertarian Republican " ideology , chiding George Bush for abandoning the crusade for small government and revealing that he became a policy - maker because he thought he could advance his radical ideology more effectively " as an insider , rather than as a critical pamphleteer " on the margins .
Yet the most interesting aspect of Greenspan 's story is what it reveals about the ambiguous role of ideas in the free - market crusade .
Given that Greenspan is perhaps the world 's most powerful living free - market ideologue , it is significant that his commitment to ideology seems rather thin and perfunctory - less zealous belief , more convenient cover story .
Much of the debate around Greenspan 's legacy has revolved around the matter of hypocrisy , of a man preaching laissez faire who repeatedly intervened in the market to save the wealthiest players .
The economy that is Greenspan 's legacy hardly fits the definition of a libertarian market , but looks very much like another phenomenon described in his book : " When a government 's leaders routinely seek out private - sector individuals or businesses and , in exchange for political support , bestow favours on them , the society is said to be in the grip of ' crony capitalism ' . "
He was talking about Indonesia under Suharto , but my mind went straight to Iraq under Halliburton .
Greenspan is currently warning the world about a dangerous looming backlash against capitalism .
Apparently , this has nothing at all to do with the policies of negligent deregulation that were his trademark .
Nothing to do with stagnant wages due to free trade and weakened unions , nor with pensions lost to Enron or the dotcom crash , nor homes seized in the subprime mortgage crisis .
According to Greenspan , rampant inequality is caused by lousy high schools ( which also have nothing to do with his ideology 's war on the public sphere ) .
I debated with Greenspan on the US radio show Democracy Now !
recently and was stunned that this man who preaches the doctrine of personal responsibility refuses to take any at all .
Yet ideological contradictions are only relevant if Greenspan really is a true believer .
I 'm not convinced .
Greenspan writes that as a student he had no interest in big ideas .
Unlike his classmates in thrall to Keynesianism , with its promise of building a better world , Greenspan was simply good at maths .
He started doing research for powerful corporations ; it was profitable , but Greenspan made no claims to a higher social contribution .
Then he discovered Ayn Rand .
" What she did ... was to make me think why capitalism is not only efficient and practical , but also moral , " he said in 1974 .
Rand 's ideas about the " utopia of greed " allowed Greenspan to keep doing what he was doing but infused his corporate service with a powerful new sense of mission : making money was n't just good for him , it was good for society as a whole .
Of course , the flip side of this is the cruel disregard for those left behind .
" Undeviating purpose and rationality achieve joy and fulfilment , " Greenspan wrote as a zealous new convert .
" Parasites who persistently avoid either purpose or reason perish as they should . "
Was it this mindset that served him well as he supported shock therapy in Russia ( 72 million impoverished ) and east Asia after the 1997 economic crisis ( 24 million pushed into unemployment ) ?
Rand has played this role of greed - enabler for countless disciples .
According to the New York Times , Atlas Shrugged - Rand 's novel that ends with the hero tracing a dollar sign in the air like a benediction - stands as " one of the most influential business books ever written " .
Since Rand is simply pulped - up Adam Smith , her influence on men such as Greenspan suggests an interesting possibility .
Perhaps the true purpose of the entire literature of trickle - down theory is to liberate entrepreneurs to pursue their narrowest advantage while claiming global altruistic motives - not so much an economic philosophy as an elaborate , retroactive rationale .
What Greenspan teaches us is that trickle - down is n't really an ideology after all .
It 's more like the friend we call after some embarrassing excess who will tell us , " Do n't beat yourself up : You deserve it . "

Why do girls on average lead boys for all their years in the classroom , only to fall behind in the workplace ?
Do girls grow up and lose their edge , while boys mature and gain theirs ?
Ten years ago , no one would have thought to ask .
The assumption that boys dominated at school as well as at work , while girls were silenced or ignored , seemed beyond dispute .
But in her new book , “ The Sexual Paradox , ” a ringing salvo in the sex - difference wars , Susan Pinker stacks up the evidence of boys ’ classroom woes and girls ’ triumphs .
“ In the United States , boys are three times as likely to be placed in special education classes , twice as likely to repeat a grade and a third more likely to drop out of high school , ” she writes .
Tests of 15 - year - olds in 30 European countries show girls far outstripping boys in reading and writing and holding their own in math .
Boys are overrepresented in the top 1 percent of math achievers , but there are also more of them at the bottom .
A 2006 economics study showed universities practicing affirmative action for men so that superior female applicants would n’t swamp them .
“ If you were to predict the future on the basis of school achievement alone , ” Pinker writes , “ the world would be a matriarchy . ”
And yet , of course , it is not .
Once they move from school to work , men on average earn more money and run more shows .
They particularly dominate in national government , the corporate boardroom and the science laboratory .
Meanwhile , women are more likely to leave the labor force and to end up with lower pay and less authority if they come back .
Pinker , a psychologist and a columnist at The Globe and Mail in Canada , is careful to remind her readers that statistics say nothing about the choices women and men make individually .
Nor does she entirely discount the effect of sex discrimination or culture in shaping women ’s choices .
But she thinks these forces play only a bit part .
To support this , Pinker quotes a female Ivy League law professor : “ I am very skeptical of the notion that society discourages talented women from becoming scientists , ” the professor writes .
“ My experience , at least from the educational phase of my life , is that the very opposite is true . ”
If women are n’t racing to the upper echelons of science , government and the corporate world despite decades of efforts to woo them , Pinker argues , then it must be because they are wired to resist the demands at the top of those fields .
The First Policeman . . .
The officer , who was nearing retirement , had seemed happy and showed no signs of depression .
But you probably did n't hear much about that
because ,
on Wednesday , the 12th of March , 2008 , it was announced in the media that :
The Second Policeman . . .
Manchester Chief Constable Michael Todd , 50 , was found dead in Snowdonia , about 240 miles northwest of London , . . . .
He had been missing since going out for a walk Monday during his day off .
obviously
That ’s two peelers immediately declared ‘ suicided ’ by the media , without any use of the word ‘ apparent ’ , in the space of a few days .
found dead next to a half - empty bottle of gin .
His coat had also come off and some of his clothes were discovered nearby .
The BBC News BBC 4 " PM " at 5.00 pm GMT made the odd announcement that Michael Todd sent texts to friends on Monday afternoon which gave rise to concern that suggested danger to his life and that of the recipients .
( This wording was slightly revised on the 6 o clock news )
fallen off a cliff
been found with a half - empty bottle of spirits nearby
A post -mortem examination carried out on the body of the police chief found on Snowdon found no signs of trauma from a jump or a fall .
and :
Todd was found to have 105 milligrams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood in his system , Caslin said .
The legal limit for driving is 80 milligrams per 100 millilitres .
Police chief had high blood - alcohol level , inquest confirms
Manchester police chief Michael Todd did not have a " huge " amount of alcohol in his blood when he died on Snowdon , the coroner said as his inquest began .
' high blood - alcohol level '
less than one and a half times the legal driving limit
the legal limit is purposely set at a very low level

" On behalf of ACPO , " Mr Todd wrote , " I agreed to look at the issues .
None of the airports involved are located within my own police area and , consequently , I was able to look at the issues with a degree of independence . "
Ho .
Ho .
Ho .
" UKIS and HMRC ’s respective interests in General Aviation Reports relate to identifying risk in relation to passengers declared on the form and on movement of prohibited and restricted smuggled goods .
Passengers who remain on board an aircraft that lands on UK soil , for example to refuel , are regarded as airside transit passengers and not normally subject to immigration or customs control unless they seek to enter the UK .
Both Services firmly point out that if their staff suspected that passengers were being transported illegally or in breach of their human rights , this would be passed to the relevant authority – most likely the Police in the first instance . "
" I am encouraged by the reassurances from my colleagues in HMRC and UKIS about the action their staff would take if they thought that these offences were being committed at a UK airport .
I can add that police officers would take such allegations made to them , whether from UKIS , HMRC or any other source seriously and take appropriate action including boarding aircraft , if necessary , to investigate . "
It appears that no aircraft were boarded , or if they were Chief Constable Todd had not discovered any evidence that they had .
Mind you , he did n't spend a lot of time or effort in looking .
Or did he ?
This was not , we must remind ourselves , in any way an official enquiry , he was not empowered to seek out evidence or witnesses , no crimes had been reported or recorded , no Minister had officially sanctioned such an enquiry , it had not been approved by anybody .
ACPO has no legal authority to sanction any such enquiry .
Indeed the letter he wrote to doe eyed media star Sami , was on Greater Manchester Police notepaper .
The Third Policeman . . .
A commended police inspector has died after apparently jumping off a cross -Channel ferry , it was revealed today .
Inspector Neil Munro , 43 , boarded the Brittany Ferries ship alone late last night in Poole , Dorset .
The married father - of - one - the third policeman thought to have killed himself in the space of four days - went overboard in Poole Harbour a short time after it set sail at 11.45 pm .
That ’s two three peelers immediately declared ‘ suicided ’ by the media in the space of a three days .

On Monday , the 10th of March 2008 , Police Sergeant Richard Fuller , 55 , head of security for the Duchess of Cornwall , Camilla Parker - Horseface , was found dead after apparently shooting himself at his home .. .
. andsince a Top Cop such as a Chief Constable of Manchester is far more important and therefore bigger news , than a mere Police Sergeant ( even if he is ' head of security ' for the Duchess of Horseface ) Sergeant Fuller 's death got scant notice in the rush to provide salacious details ' relating ' to the death of Chief Constable Todd .
Now for those of you that are counting :
What struck me most about the reporting on Chief Constable Tood 's death was how quickly the media was saturated with stories of how he had been : and also that he had been sending ' troubling ' SMS messages to friends and collegues :
Despite the media 's many stories telling us in no uncertain terms that Chief Copper Todd hadand that his body body hadthe inquest into his death announced :
In their headline on the subject the next day , The Guardian very forcefully told us that : while the BBC , more correctly , stated that : I mention the difference in reporting on the blood alcohol level because I find it hard to understand how someone with less than one and a half times the legal blood / alcohol limit for driving could be described as having aespecially when one considers the fact that he was on foot and in Britain a blood / alcohol level of 105 mil per 100 could not possibly be considered above average given the high level of alcohol consumption prevalent amongst the population at large .
Nor was he driving at the time , so how the level of alcohol in his blood has any relevance to the legal blood / alcohol limit whilst driving a motor vehicle is beyond me .
That said , the level of blood / alcohol in his blood was , as I said As many are no doubt aware , so as to ensure that any one driving a vehicle could not legally do so if their alcohol intake was sufficient to impair their driving ability .
Hence , to say that Mr Todd had a high blood - alcohol level , when the level was a mere 105 mil per 100 , is quite misleading .
Whysub - editor that wrote the headline wished to mislead us is a question open to debate ... There has been some speculation that Chief Constable Todd was the victim of some shadowyplot as a result of his ' investigation ' into CIA ' rendition ' flights reported to have passed through British airports carrying kidnapped Muslims on their way to be tortured in compliant 3rd world dictatorships / client - states .
The implication is that he stepped on some very sensitive toes in the course of his ' investigation ' .
I find such speculation to be fairly laughable in light of what our good friend Lord Patel wrote on the matter : Something that happened on the night of Wednesday , the 13th of March , 2008 , may also have escaped your notice .
It was announced that Inspector Neil Munro , 43 , of Dorset , apparently jumped off a cross-Channel ferry .
Now for those of you that are counting :
For some reason the words ' Bryn Estyn ' popped into my head as soon as I heard the news of the First Policeman .
With the addition of the Second Policeman , the word ' Jersey ' is also firmly lodged there .
Now that we have news of a Third Policeman , both of those words can now be joined by the word ' Portsmouth ' also .

Director of charity for homeless veterans demands apology from Bill O'Reilly
Carol Gardener , executive director of Fitzgerald House , which provides transitional housing and job placement assistance to homeless veterans , recently appeared at News Corporation headquarters to deliver a petition to FOX News mainstay and The O'Reilly Factor host Bill O'Reilly .
The petition , signed by 17,000 people , demands an apology from O'Reilly over a claim he made that there are no homeless veterans .
" The only thing sleeping under a bridge is that guy 's brain , " O'Reilly quipped during his January 4 broadcast , referring to part of a speech that former senator and presidential candidate John Edwards ( D - NC ) gave , dropping a figure of 200,000 veterans sleeping " under bridges and on grates . "
( The Department of Veterans Affairs estimates 195,000 . )
O'Reilly repeatedly joked about homeless veterans , insisting that , even if there was such a problem , there " are n't that many . "
" I 'd love to meet Bill O'Reilly , " says Gardener , who arrived flanked by actual homeless veterans , " to sit with him and talk about the homelessness among veterans in this country . "

Internet addiction appears to be a common disorder that merits inclusion in DSM -V .
Conceptually , the diagnosis is a compulsive - impulsive spectrum disorder that involves online and / or offline computer usage ( 1 , 2 ) and consists of at least three subtypes : excessive gaming , sexual preoccupations , and e-mail / text messaging ( 3 ) .
All of the variants share the following four components : 1 ) excessive use , often associated with a loss of sense of time or a neglect of basic drives , 2 ) withdrawal , including feelings of anger , tension , and / or depression when the computer is inaccessible , 3 ) tolerance , including the need for better computer equipment , more software , or more hours of use , and 4 ) negative repercussions , including arguments , lying , poor achievement , social isolation , and fatigue ( 3 , 4 ) .
Some of the most interesting research on Internet addiction has been published in South Korea .
After a series of 10 cardiopulmonary - related deaths in Internet cafés ( 5 ) and a game - related murder ( 6 ) , South Korea considers Internet addiction one of its most serious public health issues ( 7 ) .
Using data from 2006 , the South Korean government estimates that approximately 210,000 South Korean children ( 2.1 % ; ages 6 – 19 ) are afflicted and require treatment ( 5 ) .
About 80 % of those needing treatment may need psychotropic medications , and perhaps 20 % to 24 % require hospitalization ( 7 ) .
Since the average South Korean high school student spends about 23 hours each week gaming ( 8 ) , another 1.2 million are believed to be at risk for addiction and to require basic counseling .
In particular , therapists worry about the increasing number of individuals dropping out from school or work to spend time on computers ( 5 ) .
As of June 2007 , South Korea has trained 1,043 counselors in the treatment of Internet addiction and enlisted over 190 hospitals and treatment centers ( 7 ) .
Preventive measures are now being introduced into schools ( 9 ) .
China is also greatly concerned about the disorder .
At a recent conference , Tao Ran , Ph.D. , Director of Addiction Medicine at Beijing Military Region Central Hospital , reported 13.7 % of Chinese adolescent Internet users meet Internet addiction diagnostic criteria — about 10 million teenagers .
As a result , in 2007 China began restricting computer game use ; current laws now discourage more than 3 hours of daily game use ( 10 ) .
In the United States , accurate estimates of the prevalence of the disorder are lacking ( 11 , 12 ) .
Unlike in Asia , where Internet cafés are frequently used , in the United States games and virtual sex are accessed from the home .
Attempts to measure the phenomenon are clouded by shame , denial , and minimization ( 3 ) .
The issue is further complicated by comorbidity .
About 86 % of Internet addiction cases have some other DSM - IV diagnosis present .
In one study , the average patient had 1.5 other diagnoses ( 7 ) .
In the United States , patients generally present only for the comorbid condition (s ) .
Thus , unless the therapist is specifically looking for Internet addiction , it is unlikely to be detected ( 3 ) .
In Asia , however , therapists are taught to screen for it .
Despite the cultural differences , our case descriptions are remarkably similar to those of our Asian colleagues ( 8 , 13 – 15 ) , and we appear to be dealing with the same issue .
Unfortunately , Internet addiction is resistant to treatment , entails significant risks ( 16 ) , and has high relapse rates .
Moreover , it also makes comorbid disorders less responsive to therapy ( 3 ) .
While it looked like Mac users could n't wait to get their hands on the latest version of Apple 's operating system , their Windows counterparts seem to have been a little more reticent about picking up Microsoft 's oft - delayed Vista upgrade -- so much so that Redmond decided to both extend XP 's shelf life by six months as well as offer an unprecedented " downgrade " service on select SKUs .
Well with the June 30th cutoff fast approaching , PC World decided to take a look at your options for procuring an XP license after that date , but unfortunately , the picture is n't too pretty .
Basically , personal users looking to purchase less than 25 licenses but not a new machine have almost no recourse ; your only surefire move is to buy a new box pre-installed with Vista Business or Ultimate from an OEM opting to continue with that downgrade service .
Still , caveat emptor : support for consumer versions of XP ends on April 14 , 2009 , and with it , the end of your Patch Tuesday celebrations .

I write a lot about productivity .
But productivity only matters if you have a reason to be productive .
If you do n’t have the motivation , then waking up early , setting up to - do lists and changing habits seems silly .
When you feel apathetic , you might have a lot of extra time , and still end up procrastinating .
Recently , a reader asked me what to do about this problem .
He was n’t depressed , he was just bored .
There was no motivation to do anything more than the bare minimum .
Apathy is a common problem .
I ’ve had certainly had motivational dry spells .
While I do n’t think there is an instant cure to this problem , I ’ve noticed that apathy is usually caused by one of two problems :
You do n’t have any goals .
You ’re working on the wrong goals
Setting Goals to Combat Apathy
Apathy sets in when you forget what you want .
Finding motivation needs to start by focusing on your desires .
Not the goals other people have pushed on you .
Not the goals you think are reasonable or practical .
Not the goals you feel you should have .
But the goals that fill you with enthusiasm .
If I find myself starting to slip into apathy , I try to reconnect with what I want .
I get out a piece of paper and write out all the things I ’d like to do , be or accomplish .
These can be little goals or huge , unrealistic dreams that might never be finished .
The point of this exercise is n’t to be reasonable .
It ’s to focus you back on the things that drive you .
If you write down ideas on a piece of paper , but you do n’t feel inspired , you ’re doing it wrong .
Sometimes it takes a few minutes of writing out mild interests before you break into your true desires .
When you ’re finished the brainstorm , you might not have a lot of usable ideas .
Many of your dreams might seem completely out of reach or highly improbable .
That ’s okay .
But at least you have a starting point .
You now have a roadmap of the things that fill you with motivation .
Usually , at this point , it ’s a good idea to pick one or two of the idea you ’ve written down and set a goal around it .
The next step is to write it down , make a plan and set a deadline .
Those last steps are helpful , but they are n’t as important as having a goal that motivates you .
The motivation and working on a goal are far more valuable than actually reaching it .
When You ’ve Picked the Wrong Goals
A more common reason to feel apathetic is that you ’re focusing on the wrong goal .
You ’ve committed yourself to a goal that does n’t motivate you anymore .
Sometimes this happens because you ’ve changed since you made the initial commitment .
You were once inspired by the idea , but now you are n’t .
Other times you were never inspired by the goal , but felt like you needed to pursue it in any case .
I was in this exact situation when , fifteen months into a big project , I hit a wall .
The project had initially inspired me and I was extremely motivated .
But , over time , I gradually lost interest in seeing it completed .
I finally hit my breaking point when , in the middle of working , I stopped and never started again .
Economists call this a “ sunk cost ” .
You ’ve invested so much of your time and energy into a goal , you feel you need to finish in order to break even .
You ’re scared that if you quit now , all that energy and time will have been wasted .
So you keep driving away at a goal that has lost meaning to you .
This line of reasoning is wrong on two counts .
It ’s wrong because , even if you do n’t finish , your time and energy was n’t wasted .
It ’s also wrong because , even if that time was wasted , it ’s gone now , and should n’t be factored into the current decision .
The Purpose of a Goal is Motivation
The time spent working on a goal is n’t wasted , even if you never reach the goal .
This is because the whole point of setting a goal is to connect you with what you desire .
Actually finishing the marathon , earning a million dollars or starting your own business are less important .
I have goals that are n’t finished today .
I might achieve them in the future .
I might not .
That does n’t matter .
What really matters is that my goals fill me with enthusiasm right now .
Even if I never reach the end , thinking about my goals makes me enthusiastic about life .
That ’s the point .
So , if you give up on a goal midway , that is n’t a failure .
The goal still served it ’s purpose .
It made you enthusiastic at one time .
When it ca n’t do that anymore , you ’re probably better off finding a better goal .
Should You Persist Through Lost Motivation ?
Even on inspiring goals , it is still easy to lose motivation from time to time .
Temporary failures , a harsh critic or a new project idea can disrupt your motivation .
Sometimes it can be hard to decide whether your apathy is just a brief flicker or a sign you need to quit .
My rule of thumb , which works in most cases , is that if trying to motivate yourself results in feeling less motivated , you ’ve probably picked the wrong goal .
When you try to get enthusiastic but feel even more apathetic , the goal is broken .
But if thinking about your goal still makes you excited , you probably just need more patience .
Fighting apathy is n’t easy .
There are so many reasons to feel lost and so few reasons to get excited .
But if you focus on the few reasons that do get you excited , you might find that there are more than enough to be happy .

A teenager was left in agony and covered in weeping sores after suffering a severe allergic reaction to hair dye .
Lois Queen , 13 , was rushed to hospital after using L'Oreal Casting Crème Gloss in chocolate brown .
Her face is still swollen 10 days after using the product and she 's vowed never to dye her hair again .
Miss Queen bought the hair dye from a local shop near her home in Mottingham , south London , for £ 5.99 .

Lois wanted to change her hair colour before her 14th birthday party
She wanted to colour her hair for her forthcoming 14th birthday party , which takes place next month .
Miss Queen followed the instructions on the pack and , under the watchful eye of her mum Lorna , 40 , carried out the allergy patch test 48 hours before applying the dye .
After her face ballooned , she was rushed her to hospital where doctors diagnosed a severe allergic reaction and gave her steroids and antihistamines .
The hair dye used by Lois Queen
Miss Queen said : ' The pain was intense .
It was terrifying .
Within hours of using it my eye went red and itchy , then the swelling started .
The next morning I could barely open my eyes .
' It was so painful .
I thought I was going blind and dying .
My head was such a weird shape , I looked like an alien . '
Lois said : ' Doctors gave me medicine but it did n't get better , it got worse .
I had to go back three times .
' I 'd wanted to look better but ended up looking like a freak . '
Mrs Queen , a mum - of - four children and a trainee teacher , said : ' The doctor said she was lucky to avoid permanent eye damage .
' Lois missed a whole week of school and has been miserable .
She 's really down , wo n't eat and wo n't leave the house .
' The swelling has gone down a bit but she is still covered in weeping sores that are getting infected .
It 's miserable .
' She dyed her hair for her 14th birthday party – coming up in May .
She 's really gutted .
' I'm revolted and Lois will never dye her hair again .
L'Oreal obviously use very strong ingredients .'
One of Zimbabwe 's leading human rights campaigners has issued the world with a startling reminder of the horrific abuse and torture being suffered under Robert Mugabe 's regime ahead of the country 's elections in three weeks ' time .
Takavafira
Zhou , a trade union activist , was seized by government police two weeks ago and , while imprisoned , did not know if he would make it out of the torture chamber alive .
Beaten to within an inch of his life , Mr Zhou was told to repeat the slogan " Robert Mugabe is always right " , and now he has come to Britain to preach the reverse .
Still bearing the scars that are a testament to President Mugabe 's brutal rule , Mr Zhou is to defy his oppressors by telling protesters today at the Action for Southern Africa ( Actsa ) pro-democracy rally in Trafalgar Square of the human rights violations taking place in his country .
From there he and his trade union colleagues will go to Brussels to lobby the EU commissioner for Human Rights to take action against the dictator .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Mr Zhou says the time to act is now .
" The suffering in Zimbabwe cannot continue for another day , " he said , on arrival in London yesterday .
" International leaders are complicit in human rights abuses in Zimbabwe by their failure to provide a solution or to induce a solution in Zimbabwe .
We really wonder why Zimbabwe has taken so long to get international help .
In Kenya it did not take so long .
Why ? "
Three weeks from today , Zimbabweans will be going to the polls , but Mr Zhou is not hopeful that the elections on 29 March will be democratic .
" There will be no free and fair elections in Zimbabwe " , he said .
" And anyone who says there can be is daydreaming . "
At the end of the month , the 84 - year - old President will face two of his strongest opponents yet : his former finance minister Simba Makoni , 57 , backed by ruling party rebels , and Morgan Tsvangirai , 55 , the leader of the Movement for Democratic Change .
But many believe that even these strong candidates do not stand a chance against the closely guarded regime of Mr Mugabe and Zanu - PF .
Outside electoral observers are being brought in , but opposition party members say that these will be taken entirely from countries that Mr Mugabe perceives as " friendly " to the regime .
Russia is the only European country to have been invited to monitor the elections while the majority of remaining observers will be from the Southern African Development Community ( SADC ) – a body which has already been criticised for dealing too leniently with Mr Mugabe .
Zimbabwe 's Foreign Minister , Simbarashe Mumbengegwi , openly admitted yesterday that countries which had opposed Mr Mugabe would not be invited to monitor elections .
" Clearly , those who believe that the only free and fair election is where the opposition wins , have been excluded since the ruling party , Zanu - PF , is poised to score yet another triumph , " Mr Mumbengegwi said .
But another Mugabe win would be far from a triumph for the Zimbabwean people , according to Lucia Matibenga , the vice - president of the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions , and an electoral candidate for the MDC in Harare .
She has also seen the catastrophic effects of Mr Mugabe 's tight grip of power , and will stand alongside Mr Zhou in Trafalgar Square today .
" I do n't see that we are preparing for free and fair elections given that violence is now institutionalised , " said Ms Matibenga .
" I think particularly in the rural areas people will find it very difficult to vote against Zanu - PF because of the threats made against them .
Chiefs are paid by Robert Mugabe to use any means possible to ensure that their people vote for him . "

For Mr Zhou , the reasons for a democratic challenge to Mr Mugabe are compelling .
The 40 - year - old university lecturer and president of the Progressive Teachers Union has witnessed first - hand how the President 's clampdown on free speech has penalised innocent protesters .
Two weeks ago the human rights activist was leading a group of teachers handing out leaflets in Harare to campaign against the country 's crippled education system when he was taken by Zanu - PF militia .
The leafleting had taken place dangerously close to the party 's headquarters , and within minutes of being discovered all the teachers were dragged into an underground cellar .
Teams of 15 men used logs and iron bars to beat them .
Mr Zhou and his fellow campaigners were battered – and some of the women sexually abused – with the iron rods , until they were left motionless on the blood - stained floor .
" It was so terrible .
I 've never seen such thuggery ; I 've never seen such brutality , " said Mr Zhou .
When the beatings became so bad that three of his fellow - protesters passed out , the police became afraid and took them to hospital , where they remained under police guard for four days .
Now the police are trying to charge them with criminal nuisance , but Mr Zhou says such a charge would be a gross injustice .
" I do n't see what is criminal or what is a nuisance about trying to save the collapsing education system " , he said .
Last month , he lost his job as a history lecturer at Great Zimbabwe University after submitting an anti-government paper .
But Zimbabwe 's universities have been closed anyway for several weeks now , as a jittery Mr Mugabe tightens his control on anti-government sentiment ahead of the elections .
When Mr Mugabe – a former school teacher himself – first became leader , there was hope that he would usher in a new era for education in Zimbabwe .
But now , amid crippling inflation and government control , the schools lie empty and dilapidated ; 25,000 teachers abandoned their posts last year , and a further 8,000 have left in this year already .
The few teachers who remain have been on strike since January over poor pay and the introduction of untrained militia as teaching staff .
" This militarisation is what happened in Nazi Germany or with Mussolini 's youth militia " , warned Mr Zhou , who says that the teacher Mugabe of the 1960s would not have let such atrocities occur .
" The old Mugabe only wants his voice to be heard , but the young Mugabe wanted to hear the voices of the oppressed , " he said .
Teachers now have a salary of just four million Zimbabwean dollars , enough for little more than eight bottles of cooking oil .
Mr Mugabe 's soldiers , meanwhile are paid 2.3 bn Zimbabwean dollars .
" When Mugabe was 28 , he said : ' If the government touch a cent of my salary I 'll box them , ' " said Mr Zhou .
" We do n't want to box Robert Mugabe ; we 're saying teachers have legitimate demands that should be met by the government . "
It is unclear what horrors will await Mr Zhou on his return to Zimbabwe next week but he says he will not be gagged in his attempts to hold back the dictator 's lust for power .
" I am not afraid of going back , " he said .
" I take casualties as part of the struggle and part of leadership .
Zimbabweans must note that they can't afford to stand on the touchline to watch a game they should be playing .
Dictators do not willingly give up power , they need to be pushed . "
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The U.S. trade deficit widened unexpectedly in February as imports of consumer and other goods set a record and grew faster than exports , which hit a record for the 12th consecutive month , a U.S. government report showed on Thursday .
The monthly deficit widened 5.7 percent to $ 62.3 billion , from an upwardly revised estimate of $ 59.0 billion for January .
Wall Street analysts had expected the gap to narrow to $ 57.5 billion .
Despite slow U.S. economic growth that has spawned fears of a recession , imports of goods and services rose 3.1 percent to $ 213.7 billion , the Commerce Department report showed .
In a broad - based sign of renewed U.S. demand , records were also set in individual categories for consumer goods , capital goods , industrial supplies and materials and food , feed and beverages .
Meanwhile , U.S. petroleum imports declined in February to $ 37.7 billion after 11 consecutive monthly increases .
FBN ratings are even lower than I thought possible
Only 6,000 people are watching Rupert Murdoch 's new all business cable network during the work day , according to Nielsen ratings data obtained by the Daily News .
And , after eight weeks on the air , Fox Business Channel is averaging just 15,000 viewers in prime time .
If the average number of viewers at night all got together , they would n't even fill Madison Square Garden .
For comparison , 284,000 viewers tune in to CNBC during the day , with 238,000 in prime time .
Even though it 's just getting off the ground these rating make Tucker Carlson look good .
C&L draws that many readers in about 40 minutes .
Rupert does n't care if he loses millions of dollars for years to come because he has the cash to fund a media loser for eons .
To him --- it 's just another venue to extend his GOP / NEOCON / free market / NAFTA loving beliefs .
Media Bistro has more .
First , we can make the generalized hylomorphism from the other day more efficient by noting that once you inline the hylomorphism , you can see that you do 3 fmaps over the same structure , so we can fuse those together yielding :
g_hylo :: ( Comonad w , Functor f , Monad m ) => ( forall a . f ( w a ) -> w ( f a ) ) -> ( forall a. m ( f a ) -> f ( m a ) ) -> ( f ( w b ) -> b ) -> ( a -> f ( m a ) ) -> ( a -> b ) g_hylo w m f g = extract .
g_hylo ' w m f g .
return -- | the kernel of the generalized hylomorphism g_hylo ' :: ( Comonad w , Functor f , Monad m ) => ( forall a . f ( w a ) -> w ( f a ) ) -> ( forall a. m ( f a ) -> f ( m a ) ) -> ( f ( w b ) -> b ) -> ( a -> f ( m a ) ) -> ( m a -> w b ) g_hylo ' w m f g = liftW f . w . fmap ( duplicate .
g_hylo ' w m f g . join ) . m . liftM g
Also , the above made me realize that most of the generalized cata / ana , etc morphisms give you a little more interesting stuff to do if you separate out the recursive part .
Then you can pass it a monad built with something other than return to perform substitution on , or inspect the comonadic wrapper on the result .
Oh , and to support my earlier claim that g_hylo generalizes g_cata and g_ana here are derivations of each in terms of g_hylo .
g_cata :: ( Functor f , Comonad w ) => ( forall a . f ( w a ) -> w ( f a ) ) -> ( f ( w a ) -> a ) ->
Mu f -> a g_cata k f = g_hylo k ( fmap Id .
runId ) f ( fmap
Id . outF ) g_ana :: ( Functor f , Monad m ) => ( forall a. m ( f a ) -> f ( m a ) ) -> ( a -> f ( m a ) ) -> a ->
Nu f g_ana k g = g_hylo ( Id . fmap runId ) k ( InF . fmap runId ) g
As an aside , histomorphisms have a dual that seems to be elided from most lists of recursion schemes : Uustalu and Vene call it a futumorphism .
It basically lets you return a structure with seeds multiple levels deep rather than have to plumb ' one level at a time ' through the anamorphism .
While a histomorphism is a generalized catamorphism parameterized by the cofree comonad of your functor , a futumorphism is a generalized anamorphism parameterized by the free monad of your functor .
futu :: Functor f => ( a -> f ( Free f a ) ) -> a ->
Nu f futu f = ana ( ( f ||| id ) . runFree ) .
return
Now , g_hylo is painfully general , so lets look at a particularly interesting choice of comonad and monad for a given functor that always have a distributive law : the cofree comonad , and the free monad of that very same functor !
This gives rise to a particular form of morphism that I have n't seem talked about in literature , which after kicking a few names around on the haskell channel we chose to call a chronomorphism because it subsumes histo- and futu- morphisms .
chrono :: Functor f => ( f ( Cofree f b ) -> b ) -> ( a -> f ( Free f a ) ) -> a -> b
Unlike most of the types of these generalized recursion schemes , chrono 's type is quite readable !
A chronomorphism 's fold operation can ' look back ' at the results it has given , and its unfold operation can ' jump forward ' by returning seeds nested multiple levels deep .
It relies on the fact that you always have a distributive law for the cofree comonad of your functor over the functor itself and also one for the functor over its free monad and so it works for any Functor .
You can generalize it like you generalize histomorphisms and futumorphisms , and derive ana and catamorphisms from it by noting the fact that you can fmap extract or fmap return to deal with the cofree comonad or free monad parts of the term .
Alternately , since the ' identity comonad ' can be viewed as the cofree comonad of the Functor that maps everything to , you can also choose to rederive generalized futumorphisms from generalized chronomorphism using the distributive law of the identity comonad .
Below you 'll find source code for generalized hylo - cata - ana- histo- futu- chrono- etc ... morphisms and their separated kernels .

Clinton Drops Another Tale From Stump Speech Clinton backs off from another stump story after it is challenged .
April 5 , 2008  --
For the second time in recent days , Sen .
Hillary Clinton has had to drop a story from her stump speech after being challenged on its accuracy .
For the past month , the New York senator liked to tell the tale of a pregnant woman who was denied health care from an Ohio hospital because she did not have $ 100 the hospital demanded to treat her .
After being turned away , the woman was brought back to the hospital days later with severe complications .
She had to be rushed to another facility for advanced treatment , but it was too late .
Both the woman and the baby died , Clinton told her audiences .
For Clinton , the story was an example of how everyone should have universal healthcare .
It is a powerful tale and always drew gasps from the audience .
The hospital , which was never named in Clinton 's speeches , objected this weekend , saying it was n't true and demanded that Clinton stop telling it .
The O'Bleness Memorial Hospital in Athens , Ohio , told the New York Times that the woman was insured and was never denied treatment .
The Clinton campaign told ABC News today that the candidate heard the story from a deputy sheriff and had no reason to doubt the story .
" If the hospital claims it did n't happen that way , we certainly respect that and she wo n't repeat the story , " said Clinton spokeswoman Mo Elleithee .
" Candidates are told stories by people all the time , and it 's common for candidates to retell those stories , " Elleithee said .
" It 's not always possible to fully vet them , but we try .
For example , medical records are confidential .
In this case , we tried but were n't able to fully vet the story . "
Elleithee said the point of the story is that the country has a health care problem .
" That 's a point very few people will dispute , " she said .
The senator 's credibility came under fire last week when she tried to burnish her credentials as a veteran of international hot spots and described dodging sniper fire upon arrival in Bosnia in 1996 when she was traveling as a First Lady .
She admitted she " misspoke " when a video emerged showing her getting off the helicopter and being greeted by a girl with flowers .
Clinton later tried to make fun of the misstep by telling Jay Leno during an appearance earlier this week that she almost was late because she was pinned down by sniper fire at the Burbank airport .
SAN FRANCISCO ( MarketWatch ) -- Crude - oil futures jumped more than $ 3 in mid-morning trading Friday after news reports that U.S. military force fired at an Iranian boat .
A ship contracted by the U.S Military Sealift Command fired at least one shot toward an Iranian boat , Reuters reported , citing an unnamed U.S. defense official .
More details were not yet available .
Crude - oil for June delivery gained $ 3.04 , or 2.6 % , to $ 119.10 on the New York Mercantile Exchange after the news .
Crude was trading higher before the report but was up less than $ 3 .
Scientists working in Madagascar have found what may be the largest frog that ever lived .
The bad - tempered Beelzebufo , or " devil frog , " also poses a big mystery —
Why do its closest relatives live half a world away in South America ?
Paleontologist David Krause of Stony Brook University in New York and his colleagues began unearthing the specimen in bits and pieces more than a decade ago .
Over the years a 75 - piece puzzle emerged that was only recently put together by fossil - frog expert Susan Evans of University College London .
Evans , lead author of a new paper detailing the find , describes the 70 - million - year - old frog as a rather intimidating animal the size of a beach ball , 16 inches ( 41 centimeters ) high and weighing about 10 pounds ( 4.5 kilograms ) .
Attitude to Match
Like its closest modern - day relatives — a group of big- mouthed frogs in South America called ceratophyrines — the devil frog also probably had a very aggressive temperament .
" These ceratophyrines are really aggressive , ambush predators , " Evans said .
" They are round with big mouths , and they will sit there and grab onto anything that walks past . "
" They 're sometimes called Pac - Man frogs , " she added , " and even the little ones will go for you .
It 's a frog with attitude , even today .
" And at two or three times the size of the largest living ceratophyrines , Beelzebufo would have had quite a lot more attitude . "
The animal sported a protective shield and powerful jaws that may have enabled it to kill hatchling dinosaurs .
" When we found out that that some of its relatives even have little horns on their heads , the ' devil frog from hell ' seemed an even more appropriate name , " Krause said .
The study describing the newfound frog appears in this week 's issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
Strange Relations
Beelzebufo's relation to frogs in South America adds another chapter to an ongoing debate about where Madagascar 's unique flora and fauna originated .
Traditional models suggest that Madagascar separated from Africa some 160 million years ago during the breakup of the supercontinent Gondwana .
It 's believed to have broken free from India some 88 million years ago and been isolated ever since .
But some scientists are challenging that model .
They suggest that specimens like Beelzebufo provide proof of a later physical link between South America and Madagascar , most likely through a connection with Antarctica .
" The presence of a South American frog in Madagascar tends to support that theory , " Evans , the London fossil - frog expert , said .
" It 's not what you 'd predict should be on Madagascar in terms of frogs .
We have a frog that today is found only in South America and has never been recorded anywhere else in the world .
" Everybody thought they had evolved [ only in ] South America , and we 've got one on Madagascar 70 million years ago . "
Though Beelzebufo is a one - of - a - kind find , it may be just one of several recently uncovered fossils that lend plausibility to the theory .
" In dinosaurs , crocodiles , birds , and mammals we 've been seeing over and over again a close evolutionary relationship between animals in Madagascar and animals in South America , " said Kristi Curry Rogers , a paleontologist at Macalester College in Saint Paul .
" It 's not what you 'd expect given the huge distance between those places today , " added Curry Rogers , who was not involved in the Beelzebufo study .
" Many of the animals that we 've been able to find have their closest relatives in the Indian subcontinent , which is not a surprise because at that time [ about 70 million years ago ] , it was right next door , " Krause , of Stony Brook University , added .
" But other close relatives were in South America , and that was a surprise based on current reconstructions of what the world looked like at that time . "
Intriguing Mystery
Laurie Godfrey is an anthropologist at the University of Massachusetts , Amherst , who is unaffiliated with the research .
She believes that the existence of a land connection between South America , Antarctica , and Madagascar sometime before the Late Cretaceous period — about 65 to 70 million years ago — seems increasingly evident .
But exactly when that connection was severed and how animals in each location subsequently evolved remains uncertain , she said .
" [ It 's ] less clear whether that connection persisted through the Late Cretaceous , or whether Madagascar owes its South American affinities to a certain amount of evolutionary stasis within those groups , which certainly may have survived on both sides long after any land connection had been severed , " she said .
More fossil finds could someday clear these muddied theoretical waters .
Unfortunately , specimens from the Cretaceous period have been rare — especially in mainland Africa , which Krause described as a " black hole " for fossils from this period .
Without fossils from this critical piece of the continental puzzle , it 's hard for scientists to be certain about the distributions of ancient animals .
For now , Beelzebufo remains an intriguing mystery .
" Based on the modern and fossil distributions of this group of big frogs , it 's not a pan-Gondwanan group , " said Macalester 's Curry Rogers .

Fox News ’ Bill O’Reilly recently told his television audience recently that John Edwards was wrong to assert that there are 200,000 homeless U.S. military veterans .
He told his viewers “ there ’s not many of them out there , ” and said he would intervene to help veterans sleeping under bridges .
On the facts , not surprisingly , Edwards was right and O’Reilly was wrong .
The real entertainment came a day later , when O’Reilly insisted that Edwards apologize for using “ class warfare . ”
The story more or less faded from public view , but it appears poised to make a comeback .
Jason Linkins has the story .
This afternoon in New York City , some of that work will resolutely continue , as a group of homeless veterans - one of the segments of the population of forgotten Americans that Edwards spoke of so often on the stump - will swarm FOX News Channel ’s Studios to bring their fight to Bill O’Reilly , the millionaire celebrity host of The O’Reilly Factor . [ … ]
Now , a group from Fitzgerald House , an “ organization representing homeless veterans , ” plans to bring their fight for recognition to Fox ’s doorstep .
They plan on visiting the Fox News Channel Studios today at 3:00 pm , and will come carrying a petition signed by 17,000 people demanding an apology from O’Reilly for his ignorance and abuse .
In a press release , Brave New Films and Fitzgerald House say thay “ have found that it is very easy to locate homeless veterans and are willing to help O’Reilly find them if his desire to help homeless vets is sincere . ”
I have a hunch his stated intention to help was probably less than sincere , but I suppose we ’ll find out soon enough .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Pope Benedict on Sunday made an emotionally charged visit to Ground Zero , where he prayed at the site of the felled World Trade Center , and later wrapped up his American visit with a triumphant Mass at Yankee Stadium .
His final day in the United States started with an eerie and somber visit to the symbol of the September 11 attacks by al Qaeda and ended with a religious service at the pre-eminent shrine of baseball , “ the great American pastime . ”
At Ground Zero , now a gaping crater , he prayed for the victims , their families and an end to hate and violence .
In the most intense public part of his first papal visit to the United States , Benedict blessed the area -- considered hallowed ground by many -- and comforted each of 24 special guests as a cello played .
They were 16 relatives of people killed when the jets hit the towers and eight survivors -- four World Trade Center workers and four first responders who rushed to help .
Some were Catholics and kissed his ring as they told them their story .
Fog shrouded tops of towering skyscrapers as the 81 - year - old pope , dressed in a long white wool coat against the chill wind and damp , read a prayer for those who died at Ground Zero , the Pentagon and on United Flight 93 , which crashed in Pennsylvania when passengers overwhelmed the hijackers .
“ God of peace ... turn to your way of love those whose hearts and minds are consumed with hatred , ” he said , after blessing the site with holy water and lighting a large candle symbolizing sacrifice and resurrection .
“ Grant that those whose lives were spared may live so that the lives lost here may not have been lost in vain .
Comfort and console us , strengthen us in hope , and give us the wisdom and courage to work tirelessly for a world where true peace and love reign among nations and in the hearts of all . ”
It was eerily silent in the construction site 75 feet below street level at the geological bedrock that supports Manhattan ’s skyscrapers .
Some survivors cried .
One of those attending was John McLoughlin , a Port Authority of New York and New Jersey Police officer who was one of the last people pulled out and who was the focus of the Oliver Stone movie “ World Trade Center ” starring Nicolas Cage .
“ SERMON THE MOUND ”
After a chilly start to the day in lower Manhattan , the sun came out in the afternoon in the Bronx when some 60,000 cheering people welcomed him to Yankee Stadium , known as “ the House that Ruth built ” after legendary 1920s slugger Babe Ruth .
There , he became the third pope to deliver what has come to be known as “ the sermon on the mound , ” a term coined in 1965 when Pope Paul VI said Mass there because the papal altar is near the spot where the pitcher throws the ball .

Nearly 60,000 people , many shouting “ we want the pope ” got on their feet and gave Benedict an ecstatic welcome as he entered and rode around in a bullet - proof “ popemobile . ”
Benedict , saying Mass from a yellow , white and purple altar platform , said faith meant not being discouraged by difficulties , even when they enveloped the Church itself .
“ It means not losing heart in the face of resistance , adversity and scandal , ” he said in his sermon in an apparent reference to the sexual abuse scandal in the United States , which was a major theme of his trip .

The loudest applause came when the pope denounced abortion , calling for protection of the rights of “ the most defenseless of human beings , the unborn child in the mother ’s womb . ”
He also said Catholics should “ reject a false dichotomy between faith and political life , ” a reference to the Church ’s position that Catholic politicians cannot support abortion or gay marriage in the name of pluralism or democracy .
At Ground Zero , the passage in the German - born pontiff ’s prayer about those with “ minds consumed with hatred ” has stirred controversy because some people interpreted it as a prayer for hijackers who were killed in the attacks and their backers .
Asked about the prayer , New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg said he had no concerns about the content .
“ He ( the pope ) really does understand what happened here and how this was an attack on freedom - loving people around the world and people who want to be able to practice their religion , ” Bloomberg told Reuters at Ground Zero .

Programmer Testifies He Was Paid To Hack Florida Election Posted by Pile ( 32527 views ) [ E - Mail link ]
Video is now surfacing showcasing a computer programmer , Clint Curtis testifying that Tom Feeney ( Speaker of the House of Florida at the time ) tried to pay him to rig election vote counts in South Florida .
( too bad he was n't paid to hack this toupee ? ) ==>
8 min clip from David Earnhardt 's documentary Eternal Vigilance : The Fight to Save Our Election System .
This clip features Clint Curtis
Anyone wonder why the mainstream media wo n't run this story ?
Click on that link in the nav bar that says ' Fairness Doctrine ' and it might explain a few things .
Full Testimony :
Wiki on Tom Feeney :
Feeney 's 2006 congressional opponent , Clint Curtis has previously provided a sworn affidavit alleging that in October 2000 , Feeney asked Curtis , then a computer programmer at Yang Enterprises , to design a computer program to falsify touch - screen voting results in Palm Beach County .
Although a Wired News story noted that Curtis had no direct knowledge of the vote counting being falsified , Curtis subsequently passed a polygraph ( lie detector ) test commissioned by a Washington , D.C. private investigator .
Clint Curtis , 46 , claims that he built the software for Feeney in 2000 while working at a software design and engineering company in Oviedo , Florida ( Feeney 's home district ) .
Curtis , in his affidavit , says that as technical advisor and programmer at Yang Enterprises , Inc. ( YEI ) he was present at company meetings where Feeney was present " on at least a dozen occasions " .
Feeney , who had run in 1994 as Jeb Bush 's running - mate in his initial unsuccessful bid for Florida Governor , was serving as both corporate counsel and registered lobbyist for YEI during the period that Curtis worked at the company .
Feeney was also concurrently serving as a Florida state congressman while performing those services for YEI .
Feeney would eventually become Speaker of the Florida House before being elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 2002 .
He is now a member of the U.S. House Judiciary Committee .
At an October 2000 meeting with Feeney , according to the affidavit and interviews with Curtis over the past three days , Feeney inquired whether the company could build a " vote fraud software prototype " .
At least three YEI employees are said to have been present at that meeting ; Curtis , company owner , Mrs. Li Woan Yang , and her executive secretary , Mike Cohen .
Two other YEI employees may have come in and out at different points of the meeting according to Curtis .
Curtis says that Feeney " was very specific in the design and specifications required for this program . "
" He detailed , in his own words , that ; ( a ) the program needed to be touch - screen capable ( b ) the user should be able to trigger the program without any additional equipment ( c ) the programming to accomplish this needed to stay hidden even if the source code was inspected . "
Though there was no problem with the first two requirements , Curtis explained to the Congressman that it would be " virtually impossible to hide such code written to change the voting results if anyone is able to review the uncompiled source code "
Nonetheless , he was asked at the meeting by Mrs.
Yang to build the prototype anyway .
Curtis , " a life - long Republican " at the time , claims that it was his initial belief that Feeney 's interest was in trying to stop Democrats from using " such a program to steal an election " .
Curtis had assumed that Feeney , " wanted to be able to detect and prevent that if it occurred . "
Upon delivery of the software design and documentation on CD to Mrs.
Yang , Curtis again explained to her that it would be impossible to hide routines created to manipulate the vote if anybody would be able to inspect the precompiled source code .
Mrs .
Yang then told him , " You do n't understand , in order to get the contract we have to hide the manipulation in the source code .
This program is needed to control the vote in South Florida . " [ emphasis in affidavit ]
Mrs. Yang then took the CD containing the software from Curtis , reportedly for later delivery to Feeney .
In other meetings with Feeny prior to the 2000 elections , it became clear to Curtis that Feeney had plans to suppress the vote in strong Democratic precincts .
In the affidavit , Curtis claims that in those meetings Feeney had " bragged that he had already implemented ' exclusion lists ' to reduce the ' black vote ' . "
Feeney also mentioned that " proper placement of police patrols could further reduce the black vote by as much as 25 % . "
Curtis says that he submitted his resignation to YEI effective December 2000 , but stayed on until they had found someone to replace him in February of 2001 .
He eventually became employed by the Florida Dept. of Transportation ( FDOT ) after leaving YEI .
But the scandals did n't stop there .
In May of 2001 , while at FDOT , Curtis and another FDOT employee , Mavis Georgalis , discovered and then reported several allegations to the Inspector General at FDOT concerning over - billing by YEI -- who had been an FDOT contractor -- and software that was never delivered by the company .
Allegations also included the employment of a suspected illegal alien , Mr. Hai Lin Nee , who worked as YEI 's " quality control " manager .
Both Curtis and Georgalis were reportedly harassed after filing their complaints about malfeasance at YEI and pressure mounted on the FDOT -- purportedly from the powerful Feeney who was still working with YEI -- to have them both fired .
In November 2001 , after Curtis filed his complaints at FDOT , both he and Georgalis ' were subsequently sued by YEI " in retaliation " for their complaints against the company .
The charge was " theft of intellectual property " , which Curtis has categorized as " ridiculous " in interviews , because the " intellectual property " in question was , in fact , software that FDOT had long ago paid YEI to develop for them .
YEI was represented in the lawsuit by Congressman Feeney 's law firm .
When the two had sought help from FDOT in fighting YEI 's suit against them , they were told that FDOT could n't help them because FDOT had not been named in the suit .
After several rounds of court battles , Georgalis was finally successful in having FDOT added to the suit as a third co-defendant .
The suit was originally filed in Seminole County , but moved to Leon County upon the addition of FDOT .
In April of 2002 -- on the very same day -- Curtis and Georgalis were both fired by FDOT without explanation .
The Daytona Beach News - Journal reported extensively in 2002 on the case .
They reported at the time that Curtis had written to the Inspector General at FDOT to inquire why no investigation had yet been made into YEI .
As well , Curtis had contacted the Florida Bar , since Feeney was a member , to inform them that " Feeney has used his position to promote the profits of Yang Enterprises , from whom he received compensation under the guise of lobbyist and attorney . "
According to The Orlando Sentinel in 2001 , of 160 Florida congressmen , Feeney was the only known registered lobbyist .
He would later be cleared of all ethics violations brought against him in the Florida house on these matters by the Ethics Committee which included four Republicans appointed to the committee by Feeney .
Curtis was never interviewed by the Ethics Committee concerning his allegations .
After Curtis and Georgalis were fired by FDOT , each attempted to file " Whistleblower Suits " in the state of Florida .
Georgalis ' suit was successful and FDOT was eventually ordered , after lengthy court battles , to reinstate her with full back - pay by the circuit court .
Curtis ' suit was not successful due to having missed the filing deadline for the suit .
That suit , filed over three years ago , is still pending .
The reason , explained Curtis , is that YEI has since avoided all defendants attempts to depose company employees in the case .
By May of 2002 , the FDOT had finally taken up the investigation into malfeasance by YEI .
In one particularly chilling paragraph in the affidavit , Curtis explains what became of Raymond Lemme , the inspector at FDOT who was said to be pursing the allegations against YEI , Tom Feeney and the other reported matters :
" [ I ]n June of 2003 , he told me that he had tracked the corruption ' all the way to the top ' and that the story would break in the next few weeks and I would be satisfied with the results .
A few weeks later , on July 1st , Mr. Lemme was found dead with his arm slashed in a hotel room in Valdosta , Georgia . "
The death was ruled a suicide by the Valdosta Police .
Mr. Hai Lin Nee , " the ilegal alien " who had worked at YEI and was reported by Curtis , was arrested in March of 2004 on espionage charges which included " shipping radar guidance system chips for Hellfire Anti-Tank Missiles to a company in Communist China . "
Curtis discussed in detail , during our interviews , Mr. Nee having placed " wiretapping modules " into software code created by the company .
The secret " wiretapping modules " , Curtis claims , were to download information from programs built by YEI for contractors , and then either copy or send that information via Email back to YEI .
Such software , Curtis claims , was created for companies such as NASA with whom YEI held substantial contracts .
That information was sent to Curtis after he had attempted on several occasions to notify law enforcement authorities of his seemingly remarkable story of espionage , possible vote tampering and other ethical concerns .

Posted by EC on 2008-01-03 12:08:42 Broadcasters have not been afraid of the " Fairness Doctrine " sinde Ronald Reagan de-regulated big media .
They are just biased and will simply ignore a story they do n't like .
And big media would not like anything proving Bush stole the election .
For crying out loud ...

This nonsense has been out there for 4 years now ... it 's pure bull .
virtually everything this guy says has been totally debunked !!!
do n't discredit the otherwise good stuff you do with repeating the nonsense spewed by Curtis .. he 's running for Congress and just says anything that he knows can't be disproved .

I love liberals .
They rant and rant about voter fraud but when push comes to shove , they pussy out and do nothing .
So really , what does it matter if jackasses like this guy rig voting numbers ?
You will do absolutely nothing about it .

The couple 's friend spun the dog hair into wool for the jumpers
Beth and Brian Willis lost their white Samoyed , called Kara , 12 years ago and Swedish Lapphund , Penny , in 2002 .
After seeing a picture of Princess Diana wearing a dog fur stole at Crufts , they collected thousands of dog hairs from brushes and carpets .
The pair said the his and hers dog memorials were " warm and waterproof " .
Mr Willis , who worked for Pickfords Removals for 27 years , wears his doggy jumper into town every Saturday to do the weekly shop .
The 73 - year - old said : " They are extremely warm and pretty much waterproof .
I 've always got a sweat on by the time I get from the bus to the shops . "
Mother - of - three Mrs Willis first used the fur of Kara , to knit her husband 's sweater in 1990 .
Some think it 's disgusting and ask how we can do it , but it seems very normal to us
Beth Willis
Mrs Willis , 71 , said she had the idea after seeing a picture of Princess Diana wearing a dog fur stole at Crufts .
She said : " Kara was a pedigree Samoyed .
She was so posh , if she could have talked she'd not have spoken to the likes of us .
" We found out from the breeders we got the pups from that it was possible to use their coat for clothes .
" It is the most amazing stuff .
It 's like mohair but more lightweight and more soft , and the more you wash it , the more soft and fluffy it gets . "
Mrs Willis added : " People are surprised when they find out we 're wearing dog wool clothes .
Some think it 's disgusting and ask how we can do it , but it seems very normal to us . "
Even now , Mrs Willis has enough hair left over to make a new jumper , and it has been sent to a friend in Derby to be spun .
[ digg - reddit - me ] I managed to get through the heavy traffic at The New York Times to get some information on their apparent exclusive scoop on Governor Eliot Spitzer ’s “ involvement ” in a prostitution ring .
Some titillating details …
Emperors Club VIP apparently charged between $ 1,000 and $ 5,500 an hour for the services of it ’s ladies of the night .
It had offices in New York , Washington , London , Paris , and Miami .
The Web site [ of the Emperors Club ] , which was disabled shortly after the arrests were announced , ranked the prostitutes on a scale of one to seven “ diamonds . ”
A three - diamond woman , for example , could command a fee of $ 1,000 per hour .
A seven - diamond woman cost more than $ 3,000 an hour .
From the Criminal Complaint – with the Times article identifying Spitzer as Client # 9 – a record of a telephone conversation between “ Rachelle ” and “ Kristen ” , Kristen just having left Client # 9 ’s hotel room :
Client # 9 “ would ask you to do things that , like , you might not think were safe – you know ?
I mean that …very basic things . ”
No more details are given .
It is also suggested that Mr. Spitzer was a regular client .
Shortly before he is about to meet “ Kristen ” , Mr. Spitzer asks “ Rachelle ” to remind him what “ Kristen ” looked like .
“ Rachelle ” described “ Kristen ” as “ an America , petite , very pretty brunette , 5 feet 5 inches , and 105 poinds . ”
At the start of the incident described in the complaint February 11 , 2008 , Mr. Spitzer had an outstanding balance of $ 2,600 with the Emperor ’s Club .
This led to quite a number of phone calls and text messages back and forth trying to determine how he could pay appropriately .
Eventually , he paid “ Kristen ” $ 4,100 according to the complaint .
Additional suggestive information : Mr. Spitzer ’s liaison with “ Kristen ” was only revealed in the Complaint because he was soliciting across state lines – asking “ Kristen ” to travel from Manhattan down to Washington , where he was scheduled to appear before Congress the next day .
This was how the Federal government got involved with the “ interstate commerce ” .
Possibly relevant information : the Lieutenant Governor of New York is David Paterson .
Despite the fact that Mr. Spitzer did not choose to resign in his minute - and - a - half - long press conference – it ’s hard to see how he avoids it if the Times is right about Mr. Spitzer being “ Client # 9 ” .
Update : I ’m not that outraged by this .
As a matter of public policy , it ’s hard to see why high end prostitution should be illegal .
( I differentiate between high end and normal prostitution , because normal prostitutes – because they are valued less – are at increased risk of drug dependence , physical abuse , exploitation , and sexually transmitted diseases .
Normal prostitutes even suffer extremely high rates of post - traumatic stress disorder , comparable to soldiers in a war zone . )
It does seem typical that Mr. Spitzer prosecuted a number of prostitution rings as attorney general – and now finds himself labeled as the client of one .
Update II : I do n’t think there is anything wrong with going over the salacious details of the lives of public officials – especially if they come out in a criminal investigation .
There is a natural interest – at least for me – in the celebrity - style gossip .
I generally have little to no interest in news about celebrities .
But the same type of news about politicians does interest me , although I am almost and sometimes ashamed to admit it .
But some disturbing questions are beginning to be raised about how Mr. Spitzer came to be the target of this investigation – questions which my interest in the salacious details distracted me from .
Jane Hamsher at Firedoglake follows up the ABC New revelation that the operation to take down the prostitution ring apparently began when investigators noticed suspicious money transfers in Mr. Spitzer ’s private accounts .
Ms. Hamsher asks the logical question :
Why was the federal government snooping around in Mr. Spitzer ’s private financial records ?
How did this come to the government ’s attention ?
Ms. Hamsher concludes :
There are all kinds of things about this that just do n’t pass the smell test .
Scott Horton of Harper ’s points out that this prosecution was under the little - used White - Slave Traffic Act of 1910 .
Glenn Greenwald asks why it is only Mr. Spitzer ’s name that has been leaked , suggesting that this entire prosecution might have been politically motivated .
Such a thought would not have occurred to most reasonable people just a few years ago – but the numerous revelations about directives to U.S. Attorneys to investigate Democratic officials that came out of the U.S. Attorneys ’ scandal makes this seem plausible .
There are certainly unanswered questions about how this investigation got started – and why .
ka1igu1a of the Freedom Democrats points out the similarities of this incident to HBO ’s The Wire .
He shares a similar distaste for Mr. Spitzer that I have had .
I have always considered him to be somewhat of a bully – even if he shares a significant part of the agenda I espouse .
I am happy to have him as a governor – but the thought of him as president would concern me .
Emily Bazelton over at Slate gives probably the best public policy model and argument for making prostitution illegal , in contrast to my point above .

Decadence and Depravity in a small New England town .
It 's official .
Joe Lieberman and his 2006 campaign staff were either incompetent , dishonest , or both .
Atrios has the story .
On the day of the 2006 primary , Joe Lieberman 's website came crashing down .
Lieberman and his mouthpieces spent the day running around to all the media that would listen , claiming that their site had been hacked by Lamont supporters or other " extremist leftwing elements " .
Sadly , the media was all too eager to buy into the narrative and they relentlessly pushed the idea that " dirty campaign tactics " by bloggers simply had to be at the root of it .
The problem was , even at the time , it was crystal clear that this was sheer incompetence by the Lieberman camp .
Kos pointed to it that very same day :
But now I have the definitive answer as to why Lieberman 's site went down .
They are paying $ 15 / month for hosting at a place called MyHostCamp , with a bandwidth limit of 10 GB .
MyHostCamp is currently down , along with all their clients .
Here 's the deal -- you get what you pay for .
My hosting bill is now over $ 7 K per month .
A smaller site does n't need that much bandwidth , but if you 're paying $ 15 because your $ 12 million campaign is too freakin ' cheap to pay for quality hosting , then do n't go blaming your opponent when your shitty service goes out .
For their part , the Lamont campaign has offered its technical expertise to get Lieberman 's site back up ( which could be done in an hour by a competent sysadmin ) , and has added a link to the googlecached version of Lieberman 's site at the top of their blog .
Turns out that federal investigators came to the same conclusion in October 2006 after Lieberman 's camp demanded a full investigation .
From The Stamford Advocate :
A federal investigation has concluded that U.S. Sen .
Joseph Lieberman 's 2006 re-election campaign was to blame for the crash of its
Web site the day before Connecticut 's heated Aug. 8 Democratic primary .
The FBI office in New Haven found no evidence supporting the Lieberman campaign 's allegations that supporters of primary challenger Ned Lamont of Greenwich were to blame for the Web site crash .
Lieberman , who was fighting for his political life against the anti-Iraq war candidate Lamont , implied that joe2006.com was hacked by Lamont supporters .
" The server that hosted the joe2006.com Web site failed because it was overutilized and misconfigured .
There was no evidence of ( an ) attack , " according to the e-mail .
A program that could have detected a legitimate attack was improperly configured , the e-mail states .
" New Haven will be administratively closing this investigation , " it concluded .
The e-mail , dated Oct. 25 , 2006 , was included in a technical packet of information recently sent to The Advocate in response to requests under the Freedom of Information Act filed in late 2006 with the offices of state Attorney General Richard Blumenthal and U.S. Attorney Kevin O'Connor .
Yes , you read that right .
The investigation was closed on Oct. 25 , 2006 , but is just now being reported and only because of The Stamford Advocate 's persistence in demanding the investigation results .
Will Joe Lieberman publicly apologize to Ned Lamont ?
And when exactly is the investigation going to begin into Lieberman 's election tactics ?
I seem to recall that after he lost the Democratic primary to Ned Lamont , he decided to thumb his nose at Democratic voters in Connecticut and run on a third party ticket .
The problem was that there never was a 3rd party and he seemingly violated Connecticut election laws .
When does that investigation begin ?
On a final note , you may have noticed that Daily Kos was down for a little while this morning .
We are actively investigating whether Joe Lieberman or other extremist rightwing elements may have been responsible .
Stay tuned .
Update : Primary day video from the Lamont camp :
While Joe 's 3rd party status remains murky , there are a few other outstanding questions that were never addressed .
What about the suspicious $ 387,000 that Joe claimed as petty cash in the waning days of the campaign ?
And did the Lieberman campaign knowingly file a false report in an effort to influence the election ?
US Document Confirms Iraq Dungeon
A classified memo written by the top U.S. military officer in western Iraq reveals that a prison in downtown Fallujah is so overcrowded and dirty that it does not even meet basic “ minimal levels of hygiene for human beings . ”
Bookmark
Digg Email
Printer friendly “ The conditions in these jails are so bad that I think we need to do the right thing in terms of caring for the prisoners even with our own dollars , or release them , ” says the memo , written in late February by Maj .
Gen. John Kelly , commander of U.S forces in western Iraq .
The classified document , leaked to the Web site Wikileaks where whistleblowers can " reveal unethical behavior in their governments and corporations , " was authenticated by the organization and has not been challenged by the U.S. military when asked about it .
The memo contains other shocking revelations about conditions at the jail , including a massive shortage of food and water .
The prison is said to be run by Iraqi officials .
U.S. Marines oversee operation of the facility .
“ I found the conditions there to be exactly ( unbelivable [ sic ] over crowding , total lack of anything approaching even minimal levels of hygiene for human beings , no food , little water , no ventilation ) to those described in the recent ( 18 February ) FOX news artickle [ sic ] by Michael Totten entitled the ‘ Dungeon of Fallujah , ’ ” says Kelly ’s memo .
“ We need to go to general quarters on this issue right now ...
To state that the current system is broken would erroneously imply that there is a system in place to be broken . "
Totten , an independent journalist , said the prison can house a maximum of 110 prisoners but he discovered that there were more then 900 crammed into the facility .
U.S. contractors built the prison in 2005 which is located next to the U.S. Joint Communications Center .
It is unknown who received the memo from Kelly .
A Pentagon spokesman did not return calls for comment late Wednesday .
Kelly wrote that when he inspected the prison “ iraqis [ sic ] and marines present throughout my inspection as to why these conditions existed , three conditions were universaly [ sic ] cited as problems in Fallujah as well as the rest of Anbar , ” the commander ’s memo says .
“ First , there is zero support from the government for any of the jails in Anbar .
No funds , food or medical support has been provided from any ministry , ” Kelly said .
“ Second , the police that run Anbar 's jails are the same personnel responsable [ sic ] for investigating crimes .
These jailer / investigators are undermanned and more often than not spend most of their time out begging and scavenging for food than investigating crimes .
( It is unlikely the prisoners will eat today ) ...
“ I believe the Iraqi police are doing the best they can , and they literally begged me on humanitarian , moral and religious grounds to help them help the prisoners by somehow moving the government to action . ”
In a report published earlier Wednesday , Lt. Col.
Michael Callanan told United Press International that following an inspection of the prison by Kelly , U.S. forces decided to “ advise and assist ” Iraqis managing the jail and are providing food to the prisoners .
" They are being fed now , " Callanan told UPI .
In addition to the substandard conditions at the prison , Kelly ’s memo describes how the U.S. military , five years since invading the country , still cannot seem to find success training Iraq security forces .
“ The Iraqi police will ultimately be the ones whose shoulders the burden of winning or losing the fight will be carried , ” the classified memo says .
“ To date , little attention has been paid to the Iraqi corrections system in Anbar and its current discrepancies will prevent the [ Iraqi police ] from becoming a professional law enforcement force unless immediate and significant support is provided . ”

June 13 , 2007  -- ABC
News has learned that the FBI has targeted a small number of suspected hackers who allegedly took over thousands of personal computers secretly and used them to steal identities and send out massive amounts of spyware and spam .
The FBI said it has identified 1 million computer addresses that have been affected in a scheme called " botnetting " in which criminals turn other people 's computers into servers and then use them for illicit activity .
The FBI plans to use its victim assistance program to contact the many people who have had their computers hijacked in this botnetting scheme .
" The majority of victims are not even aware that their computer has been compromised or their personal information exploited , " said James Finch , assistant director of the FBI 's Cyber Division .
" An attacker gains control by infecting the computer with a virus or other malicious code , and the computer continues to operate normally .
Citizens can protect themselves from botnets and the associated schemes by practicing strong computer security habits . "
FBI spokesman Richard Kolko added , " The FBI has issued this release and public alert so that consumers will be aware of the threat of botnets and take appropriate security precaution .
" It is difficult without analyzing the individual computer or network to determine if you are a victim of a botnet .
In regards to the more than 1 million victim IP addresses uncovered in Operation Bot Roast , the FBI is working closely with industry and other law enforcement agencies to identify the owners of these IP addresses . "
To date , the federal government has charged or arrested the following individuals for similar computer fraud and abuse :
James C. Brewer of Arlington , Texas , is alleged to have operated a botnet that infected Chicago area hospitals .
This botnet infected tens of thousands of computers worldwide .
( FBI Chicago )
Jason Michael Downey of Covington , Ky. , is charged with using botnets to send a high volume of traffic to intended recipients , impairing the availability of those systems .
( FBI Detroit )
Robert Alan Soloway of Seattle is alleged to have used a large botnet network and spammed tens of millions of unsolicited e-mail messages to advertise his Web site from which he offered services and products .

Ms. Pelosi is hardly the only American politician taking China to task .
On Friday , Senator John McCain , the presumptive Republican presidential nominee , traveling in France , warned that China ’s behavior was “ not acceptable ” for a world power .
Earlier in the week , Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama , the two Democratic presidential contenders , issued strong criticisms of China .
Mr. Bush , too , has made a strong show of solidarity with the Dalai Lama .
In October , he met privately with the Tibetan leader at the White House and then attended a ceremony at the Capitol , where the Dalai Lama was awarded the Congressional Gold Medal .
It was the first time the two had appeared in public together , and the White House was well aware of the symbolism .
China analysts say the violence in Tibet demands that the president chart a careful course .
“ I think to the extent that he can work the issue privately , it ’s better , frankly , ” said Jeffrey A. Bader , an Asia specialist who worked at the National Security Council under President Clinton .
“ The public statements just make the Chinese dig in their heels all the more , make them more resolute in their repression . ”
American presidents have historically found relations with China to be a delicate dance .
But none more so than Mr. Bush , especially since September , when he met with China ’s president , Hu Jintao , in Sydney , Australia , and accepted Mr. Hu ’s invitation to attend the Beijing Olympics .
Mr. Bush has said that he wants to support American athletes and views the Games as a sporting event , but that he will use his attendance to put pressure on China to improve its human rights record .
But human rights advocates have linked the Olympics with violence in the Darfur region of Sudan and have accused Mr. Bush of giving his imprimatur to a country that , in their view , is not exerting enough influence as a major buyer of Sudanese oil to stop what the White House has termed a genocide .
On Capitol Hill , two representatives , Dana Rohrabacher , Republican of California , and Neil Abercrombie , Democrat of Hawaii , are leading a push for a boycott of the Beijing Games .
China analysts , though , say Mr. Bush has little choice but to attend , even if it means a political backlash at home .
“ This is China ’s coming out party , ” said Michael Green , an Asia expert and former Bush administration official .
“ If he were to cancel , it would be such a loss of face for China that it would make working with them on issues from North Korea to human rights much more difficult . ”

A person 's attitude to sex might be written all over their face , according to a study of attractiveness .
Psychologists also found that , when it comes to selecting relationships , heterosexual men and women are looking for entirely opposite things .
" What was interesting was the strength of the preference among men for women who were interested in short - term sex and the strength of the preference of the women for men not interested in short - term sex , " said Lynda Boothroyd of Durham University , who led the study .
Researchers surveyed 700 men and women in their early 20s , who were asked to look at photographs of the opposite sex and judge how attractive they were and what their attitudes to sex might be - such as whether they were interested in long or short - term relationships .
The answers were compared with the real - life behaviour and attitudes of the people in the images .
The results , published in the journal Evolution and Human Behaviour , showed that men and women could generally judge who would be more interested in a short - term fling just by looking at their expression and features .
In one study of 153 participants , 72 % of people correctly identified the attitudes from photographs more than half of the time .
" Men who said they were interested in short - term sex were seen as looking more masculine , " said Boothroyd .
The wit and wisdom of Ralph Nader 's dad comes to mind with the bailout of Bear Stearns with federal money , and with the future Wall Street bailouts sure to follow .
In his essay Faith - Based Economy , Tom Piatak takes on the revolting hypocrisy of " federal efforts to prop up a financial sector in trouble as a result of its own avarice . "
The first paragraph :
" It is fitting that one of the signal events of what will likely become the second Bush recession has been the Federal Reserve 's propping up of the Wall Street firm Bear Stearns .
For years , Wall Street has opposed any such bailouts of old - line manufacturing firms being swept away by the tsunami of free trade , and has applauded as employers have cut back their workforces , the benefits they provide , and even their presence in the United States .
The Wall Street mantra has been , layoffs good , outsourcing better .
But when the time comes for Wall Street speculators to experience the " magic of the marketplace , " the tune has been different , with Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson saying Sunday that " I really support the Fed 's work here . "
Of course , the Federal Reserve 's bailout of Bear Stearns , followed quickly by JP Morgan 's acquisition of the firm , comes hard on the heels of many other federal efforts to prop up a financial sector in trouble as a result of its own avarice , including the federal bailouts for foolish subprime mortgages contained in Bush 's stimulus package . "
In his essay Printing Money for Wall Street , Oskari Juurikkala equates lowering interest rates to counterfeiting :
" When a central bank lowers interest rates , it engages in an activity that is loaded with moral meaning .
The jargon of the macroeconomist can be misleading .
Lower interest rates are achieved by increasing the money supply , which is basically equivalent to " printing money out of thin air , " and selling it cheaply to the banking community ( although technically it is now achieved by creating fictitious accounting entries ) .
" The moral dimension becomes plainer if we consider a private person doing that .
It is called fraud .
Counterfeit money enriches the fraudster at the expense of the rest of the society .
Creating more paper slips does not bring about more economic resources ( production or consumption goods ) , but only serves to redistribute them .
The counterfeiter immediately acquires additional money at his disposal , whereas the purchasing power of the money balances of the rest is slowly eroded . "
This just in :
On March 25 , the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office issued its Non-Final Action on the re-examination of the Blackboard Patent .
We are studying the document , found here , but in short , the PTO has rejected all 44 of Blackboard ’s claims .
We caution that this is a NON - final action ; both Blackboard and Desire2 Learn will have an opportunity to comment before a final action will issue , and after that , the decision will be subject to appeals .
This decision actually should have come before the trial verdict but was held up because the USPTO had to decide what to do about the separate filings from D2L and SFLC .
Now , in addition to the fact that Blackboard will be able to argue against the ruling with the USPTO , there are a number of questions regarding how this affects the court case .
Will the damages finding still stand ?
Will the USPTO ruling render moot D2L ’s post - trial motion before the judge regarding invalidity ?
If not , will it imact that ruling ?
What happens to the issues of royalties and injunction going forward ?
I think that I know the answers to some of these questions but do n’t want to post anything until I have some more authoritative information .

Sony is one of the world 's most famous brands … but where did its name come from ?
When it comes to the world ’s biggest tech brands , most of us would be able to pick out Apple , Samsung , Sony and others as our favourites .
But would you buy a TV from Tokyo Tsushin Kokyo , or a DVD player from Tanaka Seizo - Sho ?
If the answer ’s no , then you should read on ...
We ’ve picked nine of the world ’s biggest brands so you can discover how they made their names
Samsung
This Korean colossus is a relative newcomer to consumer tech , starting the Samsung - Sanyo Electric Company as recently as 1969 .
Its roots go back to 1938 though , when founder Byung - Chull Lee started up a dried fruit , vegetable and fish export business .
By the late 1970s , Samsung ’s interests included petrochemical , construction , textile and ship - building industries , the company owned a string of hotels and was exporting colour TVs .
A decade later it was also making planes , dabbling in space technology and making the world ’s smallest video recorders .
Today Samsung is vying with Sony for title of world ’s biggest consumer electronics maker and spends £ 0.85 billion a year on R&D .
Samsung is the Korean name for ‘ three stars ’ - which is handy , as that ’s the review score many of the company ’s products get ;-)
Sony
Somewhat surprisingly
Sony is actually younger than its Korean arch-rival , appearing in 1946 as Tokyo Tshushin Kokyo ( aka Totsuko )
Its first product was a rice cooker .
The Sony brand - which is a conflation of Sonus , the Latin word for sound and Sonny ( as in ‘ young boy ’ ) - first appeared in 1955 .
Totsuko became Sony Corporation three years later .
Early successes were the TR - 55 transistor radio , TV5 - 303 portable TV and , of course , the TPS - L2 Walkman .
Sony ’s had something of a chequered past : it 's enjoyed notable successes with CD , DVD and the PS3 ; but it ’s just as famous for its flops - MiniDisc , DAT and Betamax .
It also likes to provoke the ire of its customers - firstly with 2005 ’s root - kit disaster and then a year later with 2006 ’s exploding laptop battery epidemic , which saw 8 million Sony - made Li-Ion batteries being recalled .
Apple
When Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak launched Apple Computer in 1976 , its choice of name was obvious - Jobs was a massive Beatles fan , and so he named the company after the Beatles - owned record label Apple Records .
That decision quickly backfired when The Beatles ’ holding company Apple Corps took Apple Computer to court over the use of the name - the beginning of a 30 - year battle that ended with Apple Computer buying the Apple brand from The Beatles in 2007 .
Mac OS 7 famously featured a system sound whose name arose as a result of a 1991 legal battle that forbade Apple Computer from having anything to do with music .
Apple ’s legal department decided that the name of one OS 7 sound ‘ chimes ’ was too musical - sounding .
Apple engineer Jim Reekes tried to change the name to Let It Beep , but eventually settled on Sosumi ( ‘ so sue me ’ ) , explaining to Apple ’s lawyers that it was a Japanese word and had nothing to do with music at all .
Sharp
The Japanese LCD TV giant took its name from one of its first ever products - the Ever- Ready Sharp propelling pencil ( later the Ever - Sharp pencil ) , which made its debut in 1916 .
The company was originally named Hayakawa Brothers Shokai , partly after Tokuji Hayakawa who had invented the pencil in 1915 .
Sharp first moved into consumer electronics in 1925 when the company began mass - producing crystal radios - the first Japanese manufacturer to do so .
LG
Famous for iPhone - baiting touchphones , as well as fridges , microwaves and TVs , LG is the abbreviated result of the merger between two different companies - Lucky , which made household products and GoldStar which fashioned cheap consumer electronics .
The GoldStar name eventually disappeared in 1995 , when the company was renamed LG Electronics , partly as the result of a push upmarket .
ATLANTA , Georgia ( CNN ) -- Christine King Farris was sewing an Easter dress for her daughter in their Atlanta home one rainy April evening when the nightly news was interrupted by a special report .
A lone survivor , Farris , 80 , is writing a memoir about life with her brother called " Through It All . "
The newscaster announced that Farris ' younger brother , the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. , had been shot in Memphis , Tennessee .
Another update came minutes later : King was in critical condition .
" It was a horrible moment , " Farris said of that night in 1968 .
" I tried to call my sister - in - law ; the lines were busy .
I tried to call my parents ; the lines were busy .
I could n't get anybody . "
While boarding a plane for Memphis , Farris learned that her brother was dead .
It was the beginning of a string of family tragedies .
Her only surviving sibling , younger brother A.D. , drowned the next summer .
Her mother , Alberta , was shot dead five years later while playing the " Lord 's Prayer " on an organ in church on Sunday morning .
Farris raises her hands in bewilderment when she contemplates the losses .
" I think of the things that I 've faced in my life , and sometimes I question how I 'm still here , " Farris , 80 , said in her office at Spelman College , surrounded by photographs of her famous brother and other civil rights leaders she once knew .
" I'm the lone survivor in my family , " Farris said .
This year , the civil rights community will gather in Memphis on April 4 to mark the 40th anniversary of King 's assassination , but Farris will not join them .
She is talking publicly about the death of her younger brother for the first time , but a return to Memphis is not part of her agenda .
" I can't go , " she said .
" I 've not been there since the time we went to gather my brother .
My memory of Memphis is not a pleasant one .
It 's one that I cannot erase . "
Farris is remembering her brother in another way .
She is writing a memoir about her life with him called " Through It All . "
A formal and reserved woman , Farris has spent the past year delving into her ugliest memories .
" It 's been a real challenge , " she said .
" I 've had to relive those moments .
Sometimes it affects me more than others .
I try to live with it . "
She says it 's important for her to push past those painful memories , because she wants to humanize her younger brother .
Everyone has heard about King , the civil rights icon .
She wants to strip away those platitudes to reveal the playful brother she knew .
" He was normal as a person could be , " she said .
" I really want people to understand that .
I want people not to think of him as some mythic character from out of space . "
The mythic nature of King 's ministry , though , is palpable in Farris ' roomy office at Spelman , the predominantly black women 's college where she has taught education for 49 years .
Farris stores photos of her brother on her desktop computer as screensavers .
As each image shifts to another , her computer plays highlights of her brother 's most famous public speeches .
Isaac N. Farris Jr. , her only son , says his mother still plays recordings of her brother 's speeches and reads his manuscripts at home .
They were n't just siblings .
They were friends .
" She was the first one to meet Mrs. Coretta [ King 's wife , Coretta Scott King ] .
She lent him money for his engagement rings , " he said .
" Over the years , she 's especially talked about missing the friendship they had . "
The resemblance to her brother is obvious up close .
She has the same square face and the same measured , Baptist preacher 's drawl .
She says she 's accustomed to people staring at her when they encounter her in Ebenezer Baptist Church , the Atlanta church her brother once led that she still attends .
" Sometimes people will point me out and say , ' That 's Dr. King 's sister , ' " she said .
" And , of course , I 'm immediately surrounded by people .
Sometimes , it 's a little uncomfortable .
I try to be as cordial as I can .
...
People come up and ask , ' Are you Dr. King 's sister ? '
I ca n't say no . "
Farris says she had no inkling that her brother would become such an iconic figure .
She remembers the little brother who loved playing pool , doing the jitterbug dance and telling jokes .
She also recalls his nickname as a young man :
Tweed .
" He had this tweed suit , and he loved it , " she said , smiling .
" He would wear it so much so the boys nicknamed him Tweed . "
Farris ' son says his mother still retains some of that playful side herself .
He occasionally catches her dancing around the house to contemporary R&B music .
" I 've seen her do the electric slide , " he said .
" She gets a kick out of it . "
When Farris ' brother was thrust to the forefront of the civil rights movement , both were aware of the danger to him .
But they never talked about it .
" When you are a part of it , you do n't really take the time to sit down and think , " she said .
" It did n't really bother us too much .
We were conscious that it could happen , but it did n't occupy front space , so to speak . "
When April 4 , 1968 , did come , Farris says , others stepped in to help her shoulder her grief .
Sen .
Robert Kennedy dispatched a plane to Atlanta to take her and King 's widow to Memphis .
Her voice remains level as she talks about the plane ride .
Then her eyes start to mist .
She says she never left the plane when it arrived .
She watched her brother A.D. come on the plane with the Rev. Andrew Young and the Rev. Ralph Abernathy , two of King 's closest aides .
" They were crying like babies , " she said .
She says she has tried to remember when she last talked to her brother , but it 's frustrating .
" I 've been trying to think about that .
He had a meeting with his staff the Saturday before he went to Memphis , but I did n't get to talk to him .
Then ... "
Farris halts herself in mid-sentence .
Then her voice trails off .
Her only son says his mom has been a " rock " for the family .
He says he 's never seen her cry about the loss of his famous uncle .
The only time he remembers seeing her cry is when her remaining brother , A.D. , drowned in 1969 .
" My mother let out a yell that still to this day brings tears to my eyes , " he said .
Farris has carved out her own life of distinction .
She married and has two children with Isaac N. Farris Sr. , an entrepreneur .
She 's written a children 's book on her brother titled " My Brother Martin : A Sister Remembers Growing Up with the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr . "
She 's also dabbled in public speaking and served as an executive at the King Center , the Atlanta - based center devoted to the teaching of King 's nonviolent philosophy .
Only recently , though , Farris experienced another series of losses .
Her brother 's widow , Coretta Scott King , died two years ago from cancer .
And Yolanda King , her brother 's oldest child , died from an apparent heart condition last year .
Yet she and her son shrug off any suggestion that her family , like the Kennedy clan , is somehow marked for tragedy .
" God never puts on us what we can't bear , " she said .
" We never embraced that ; others have , " added her son , who is CEO of the King Center .
" We have felt through it all , we 're still blessed .
That 's the way we were taught . "
Forty years after her brother 's untimely death , Farris will return to Memphis , but only through her memories .
As she sits in her office surrounded by those memories , she says it 's now more urgent than ever that she add her own chapter to his story .
She 's the only one left .
" I thought about all that I 've been through and all these memories and sometimes it gets tough , " she said .
" By being the lone survivor , if I do n't do this , a part of history will be left out . "
All About Civil Rights • Martin Luther King Jr .
President Bush got run off the track by the CIA analysts over at the Langley , who apparently , after being trampled by Vice President Dick Cheney and his Neo -Con and AIPAC - backed hordes into twisting intelligence into lies about Iraq 's non-existent nuclear and WMD programs in 2002 , decided that they would n't do the same thing this time on Iran for two lame - duck warmongers .
Instead of hyping Iran 's centrifuges , which are churning out low - level nuclear fuel - grade uranium , and warning darkly of Iran being in the midst of some clandestine campaign to build a nuclear weapons capability , the analysts this time told the truth : that the evidence , public and secret , openly available and clandestinely obtained -- shows that Iran ceased any nuclear weapons R&D efforts in 2003 , and has done nothing since to revive them .
They said that the available evidence shows that while Iran could always risk world opprobrium and sanctions and restart its nuclear weapons program , it is years and years away from making a working nuke , even if it started today -- and there is little likelihood that the country will start such a project .
The consensus opinion not just of the CIA , but also of 15 other US intelligence agencies , is that even if Iran were to decide tomorrow to start up its nuclear weapons program , it would take until 2015 for the country to produce enough plutonium or enriched U235 to make even one bomb .
To make their assessment clear , the authors of the latest National Intelligence Assessment on Iran resorted to boldfaced print to state : " This NIE does not [ italics in original ] assume that Iran intends to acquire nuclear weapons . "
This document , which was ordered up by Congress , has to be a serious blow to the plans of Bush and Cheney , who have been gunning for Iran for several years now , ever since Bush labeled the country part of his " Axis of Evil . "
Last fall , Bush and Cheney had appeared on the verge of launching an air assault on Iran 's nuclear research and development complex , ordering the USS Eisenhower aircraft carrier battle fleet to sea early following its refueling and refitting at Newport News , in time for it to join other Naval forces in the Persian Gulf and the Arabian Seas including the Enterprise carrier group and even a fleet of minesweepers on the eve of the 2006 elections .
That criminal plan , which I wrote about in the Nation at the time , appears to have been blocked by Republican elders and perhaps senior military brass ( who apparently prevailed on former Secretary of State James Baker , who with former Rep.
Lee Hamilton was heading up the Iraq Study Group , charged with coming up with a way out of the Iraq quagmire ) to pull Bush 's and Cheney 's leash .
Baker and Hamilton had all along vowed not to issue any preliminary hints of their study group 's conclusions , saying that it would all be released in January 2007 .
But suddenly and seemingly inexplicably , they announced in October that they were going to conclude that the only way out of Iraq was for the US to begin negotiations with Syria and Iran to broker a peace in Iraq .
That early report release pulled the rug out of any plan for an Iran attack .
Since then , Bush and Cheney have labored mightily to ratchet up public fears of Iran 's alleged nuclear ambitions , with Bush most recently warning of " World War III " if Iran so much as gained the " knowledge " of how to build nuclear weapons .
Naval forces have again been built up , tankers full of bunker oil and aircraft fuel were dispatched to the region , and the talk has increasingly been of a US pre-emptive attack ( with the corporate media for the most part playing willing cheerleader again .
Newsweek magazine even reported word that Cheney had gone behind the State Department 's back to importune Israel to attack Iran , so as to provoke retaliation and thus drag the US into a war ( talk about impeachable treasonout behavior , though Newsweek did n't label it as such ! ) .
Republican candidates for the presidential nomination , with the noted exception of fund - raising giant Rep. Ron Paul , have been trying to outdo each other in calling for an attack .
And on the Democratic side , Hillary Clinton , ever the tough guy , voted in the Senate to label the Iranian Revolutionary Guard a " global terrorist organization " - - a clear signal to Bush that it would be okay if he launched attacks on their bases .
Then came this NIE , like a knife in a hot - air balloon , deflating the whole project .
The embarrassment among the war - mongering would - be presidents of both parties is palpable .
But not so Bush .
While it is clear that he and Cheney have known for several months at least , and perhaps for years , that their intelligence agencies had concluded Iran had no nuclear program , and that there was no case for attacking Iran , Bush is pushing the big lie that he only just saw this NIE .
Bush is also trying to argue , incredibly , that the NIE is cause for alarm .
A day after release of the report -- which Cheney had tried to alter for the past year , and which the administration tried unsuccessfully to block from public view -- Bush insisted that Iran is " dangerous , " and claimed , against all logic , that the NIE should be seen as a " warning signal . "
Under questioning from reporters , he refused to renounce the possible use of force against Iran .
Trying to keep the pressure on , he said , " I think it is very important for the international community to recognize the fact that if Iran were to develop the knowledge that they could transfer to a clandestine program , it would create a danger for the world , "
As a number of scientists have hastened to point out however , that knowledge is as easy to obtain as the simple hiring of an unemployed Soviet nuclear physicist -- or a quick trip to the library .
It 's not the knowledge of nuclear weapons that is the danger - - it 's a program to build and test a nuclear device -- and as the NIE clearly states , there is no indication that Iran is planning to start one .
Happily , I do believe that this is checkmate for Bush 's and Cheney 's Iraq war plans .
They may still wreak havoc in Iraq .
They may try to provoke some kind of incident with Iran on the border or in the Persian Gulf .
They can still continue with their bankrupting of the US economy , and their gutting of health and safety and other regulations .
They can still continue their efforts to help their oil industry backers rape the arctic environment .
They can still obstruct efforts to attack climate change .
But they are unlikely to get their way with an air assault and a new war against Iran .
It may even be fun to watch this pathetic president and his mentor in Blair House try to re-inflate their war balloon .
Maybe , after seven years as the commander in chief of the world 's most powerful nuclear nation , and before he goes out to pasture , Bush will even try learning how to pronounce the word " nuclear " in an effort to get people to take him seriously .
If that 's even possible .

The Stock Market Surged Yesterday Because …
Why ?
I may be wrong , but it strikes me that the articles that appear in nearly every newspaper every day that describe a particular day ’s stock - market movements are pretty much worthless .
They try to pin a cause or two on the effect that ’s just been observed , when in fact the effect may have little relationship with the narrow causes being credited .
Consider , for instance , this A.P. headline and news brief that appeared on Yahoo !
News at about 2:30 p.m. yesterday :
“ Stocks Surge to Start Q2 ” Wall Street began the second quarter with a big rally Tuesday as investors rushed back into stocks amid optimism that the worst of the credit crisis has passed and that the economy is faring better than expected .
How does the A.P. really know that investors “ rushed back into stocks ” because they were optimistic that “ the worst of the credit crisis had passed ” and that the economy is “ faring better than expected ” ?
The A.P. folks sure did n’t learn this from reading their own business headlines .
Here are five A.P. headlines that appeared directly beneath the stock - surge news brief .
“ Celent : 200,000 US Banking Jobs at Risk ”
“ Manufacturing , Construction Weaken ”
“ Ford , Toyota U.S. Sales Down in March ”
“ Congress Has Big Questions for Big Oil ”

OCALA , Florida ( CNN ) -- Actor Wesley Snipes was sentenced Thursday to three years in prison for three misdemeanor counts of failing to file tax returns -- the maximum requested by federal prosecutors .
" Snipes ' long prison sentence should send a loud and crystal clear message to all tax defiers that if they engage in similar tax defier conduct , they face joining him , " said Assistant Attorney General Nathan J. Hochman of the Justice Department 's Tax Division .
Internal Revenue Service Commissioner Douglas Shulman said the law is clear on taxes .
" There is no secret formula that eliminates a person 's tax obligations , nor are there any special exceptions , " he said .
" The majority of Americans pay their taxes timely and accurately .
Those who willfully violate the law must be held accountable . "
In a civil suit , the IRS is seeking repayment of all taxes and interest from Snipes .
Federal prosecutors said the actor for nearly a decade escaped paying more than $ 15 million in income tax returns by sending money to overseas accounts , though they acknowledged in court that the amount is in dispute .
Before the sentencing , the actor asked the court to show mercy and offered three checks totaling $ 5 million as a gesture of good will .
Federal prosecutors diverted the checks to the U.S. Treasury -- which accepted the payment -- but it was n't enough .
" It 's essentially a down payment , but a fraction of what he owes , " said Assistant U.S. Attorney Scotland Morris .
Snipes ' attorneys -- who had argued he should get probation or house arrest -- said they will appeal the sentence .
The actor , who showed little reaction , gave a loud " wow " to the crowd as he exited the courtroom .
Watch Snipes leave the court »
A jury convicted Snipes on the misdemeanor charges February 1 , but he was acquitted of more serious felony charges of tax fraud and conspiracy .
Jurors accepted his argument that he was innocently duped by errant tax advisers .
Defense attorneys in court documents suggested that to sentence Snipes harshly would be to disregard the jury 's verdict .
But prosecutors , in their sentencing recommendation , said the jurors ' decision " has been portrayed in the mainstream media as a ' victory ' for Snipes .
The troubling implication of such coverage for the millions of average citizens who are aware of this case is that the rich and famous Wesley Snipes has ' gotten away with it . '
In the end the criminal conduct of Snipes must not be seen in such a light . "
Snipes , who has starred in dozens of movies , including the " Blade " trilogy , " Major League " and " Murder at 1600 " had received the support of many of Hollywood friends .
Defense attorneys filed 39 pages of testimonials , letters from a Hollywood " Who 's Who " list and also high school friends and his employees .
Actors Denzel Washington and Woody Harrelson , as well as television judges Joe Brown and Greg Mathis , submitted letters to the judge on Snipes ' behalf .
In his letter , Washington said Snipes was " like a tree -- a mighty oak ...
Many who know him have witnessed the fruit of his labors , have sat in his shade and even been protected by his presence .
I am proud of him , proud to call him a fellow thespian and most importantly , proud to call him a friend . "
Brown , who addressed the court on Thursday , likened Snipes to legendary actors , including Sidney Poitier , and said , " I have been something of a mentor to the young man . "
Another witness described how Snipes had helped train personnel from 33 airlines on safety techniques after the September 11 , 2001 , terror attacks , without seeking pay or media attention .
" This man is one of the most honorable men of character , " said Robert Wall , CEO and president of World Black Belt , a martial arts training firm .
" He 's made mistakes , but I 'm so impressed with the depth of his character . "

Reinstatement of the Draft : Canada Will
Not be an Option
The students on Colorado college campuses are taking the threat of a reinstatement of the draft seriously .
They should .
Many people think that if they or their kids get drafted , they will go to Canada .
But as of 2001 , Canada is not an option .
In 2001 , the U.S. and Canada signed the Smart Border Declaration .
A news article on the agreement is here .
Project Uncensored said at the time :
U.S. ( TGW ) – Presidential candidate and likely Republican nominee John McCain has scored a ‘ 0 ’ on the 2007 National Environmental Scorecard released today by the League of Conservation Voters .
McCain was the only member of Congress to skip every single environmental vote scored by the report .
The average member of Congress scored a 53 ; John McCain has a lifetime average of 24 .
Republican Minority Whip Trent Lott also received a score of 0 ; Barack Obama received a score of 67 ; Hillary Clinton received a score of 73 .
Bob Case of Pensylvania , Susan Collins of Maine and Bill Nelson of Florida were the only senators to receive a score of 100 .
" We were appalled two weeks ago when John McCain was the only Senator who chose to skip a crucial vote on the future of clean energy in America - dooming the measure to fail by just a single vote .
As it turns out , this was merely the most recent example of a clear pattern of missing the most important votes on energy and the environment -- as his abysmal LCV score clearly demonstrates , ” said Carl Pope , Sierra Club Executive Director .
League of Conservation Voters 2007 Scorecard Senate votes , all of which John McCain missed :
1. Cloture on H.R. 6 , the energy bill ( 6/21 , Vote 225 )
2. Passage of H.R. 6 , the energy bill ( 6/21 , Vote 226 )
3. Maintaining Renewable Electricity Standard ( RES ) in H.R. 6 ( 12/7 , Vote 416 )
4 . Taking away giveaways to Big Oil to subsidize clean energy ( 12/13 , Vote 425 )
5. Loosening public health and environmental regulations on refineries ( 6/13 , Vote 210 )
6 . Undermining the RES with coal and nuclear energy ( 6/14 , Vote 211 )
7. Offshore drilling in Virginia ( 6/14 , Vote 212 )
8. Liquid coal ( 6/19 , Vote 213 )
9. Environmental safeguards for biofuels ( 6/20 , 219 )

perfectstorm is a real time strategy game study written in common lisp using OpenGL for graphics display and cairo for texture generation .
It is in active development with many of the basic features still unimplemented , but i decided the effort put into it justifies some public documentation .
Why
I started perfectstorm because i was annoyed with the Artificial Intelligence offered in most commercial RTS games .
Although significant academic research is going on , it seldom finds its way into released games due to publishers ’ wishes for absolute stability of the “ gameplay experience ” and the notion of AI as just being responsible for pathfinding plus something .
Naturally , AI development can only begin late in the development cycle when the deadline is nearing .
The most pressing feature the single “ AI guy ” most teams employ has to do is implementing pathfinding , which is not even part of AI if you want to see it that way .
After that , only a poor makeshift enemy AI can be implemented before the product is shipped .
Aside from that , writing good AI is hard .
Or so i heard .
Most of the academic AI research going on seems to be tested on ORTS , which seems to be decent and alive .
Since i wanted to learn about general game coding and graphics development i decided not to use ORTS and write my own .
And of course , i wanted to use lisp since i had not done a serious project with lisp and wanted to test its capability ( and mine ) to cope with heavy library interaction and larger real - world projects .
The name “ perfect storm ” is a metaphor used to denote the interaction of several different parts to maximum overall effect , something i want both my RTS units and my code to perform :)
Details
For graphics , i first tested SDL , the 2D part of which turned out not to be hardware - acceleratable under X11 .
OpenGL was the only alternative and — thanks to the excellent cl- opengl bindings — is very easy and fun to use .
Now i needed textures and decided i wanted a defcon - like slick minimalist - but - pleasing look .
No complex models or realism was needed , so i figured drawing nice antialiased primitives and gradients would be enough and settled for cairo .
While cairo is certainly not fast enough for drawing life animations , it produces very nice output and is reasonably easy to use , although the cl - cairo bindings are a pain ( i hear that with cl - cairo2 and cl - cairo - cffi two alternatives have emerged ) .
After spending quite some time setting everything up and finally successfully extracting pixel data from cairo i started defining first units and implementing dummy game mechanics and graphics .
Status
Since then , the game has grown and , with the developer count rapidly soaring up to two , includes the following features :
User - definable units and weapons that can be plugged together
Object - oriented very open design
Some 20 different textures , with the possibility to add more very easily
Fragment shaders for nice glows and flickering laser beams
Pathfinding
In - game developer console ( aka REPL )
Future Plans
In the near future , i’d like to see the following things :
Steering behaviours for units ( currently work in progress )
A first easily replaceable resource scheme
Buildings
More verbose GUI
Dummy ai for first playtesting
You are welcome to try it and play around if you like , or even contribute something .
Currently , the svn version is not guaranteed to be in any usable state or even to compile .
Since we are more or less concentrating on one feature at the time , it is likely you will see some debug output concering the current development focus when just starting it .
Dependencies are listed in the README file .
You can check it out from svn://erleuchtet.org/perfectstorm .
You will need both the cairo and OpenGL bindings from the same svn repo since i added some features that are needed by perfectstorm .
But beware !
the current state is not that presentable : you ’ll just see pathfinding debug output at the moment .
When a first dummy is playable and the code is cleaned up a bit we ’ll make a project page .

The Ariane rocket will be rolled back for testing
The spacecraft 's Ariane rocket has developed an electronic problem in one of its solid fuel boosters and will be rolled back to an inspection shed .
The flight , originally timed for Friday night , is not now expected to take place until Monday at the earliest .
The £ 3.6 bn Skynet project is designed to give British commanders access to more information , much faster .
" We tried to understand what 's going on [ in the electronic equipment ] but unfortunately we did not succeed , " explained Jean - Yves Le Gall from Arianespace , the company which runs the Kourou spaceport in French Guiana .
" We are now taking the launch vehicle back to the Final Assembly Building where we will investigate the equipment and replace it . "
The countdown was stopped six hours , two minutes and 34 seconds before the scheduled lift - off .
Video demand
The Skynet 5B platform is set to join in orbit the 5A satellite , which was lofted successfully in March and is already handling secure traffic for UK forces in Iraq and Afghanistan .
The spacecraft , which have been developed by EADS Astrium in Stevenage and Portsmouth , provide - two - and - a - half times the bandwidth capacity of their predecessors , the Skynet 4 satellites .
Controllers take no risks with a launch
Only today , the Ministry of Defence announced it had started flying its new Reaper Unmanned Aerial Vehicles ( UAVs ) in Afghanistan .
The planes will gather intelligence on Taliban activities and their pictures can be fed back to the UK via Skynet 5A for further analysis , if necessary .
The problem with the Ariane rocket also delays the launch of Skynet 5B 's co-passenger - a Brazilian satellite called Star One C1 which will deliver broadband internet services to consumers in South America .
Delays to launches are not uncommon .
Officials constantly monitor the rocket and its payload and if there is the slightest doubt , the flight is stood down .
Skynet 5A was itself held on the ground for 24 hours when a fault developed in the launch table .
" This is the price for total quality ; we do not want to take any risks , and this is why we replace equipment anytime we could have a problem , " said Mr Le Gall .
The technical teams responsible for the satellites will continue to monitor their systems over the weekend .
Umbilical connections to the Ariane allow engineers to talk to the spacecraft even though they are closed inside the top of the rocket .
" At this stage , the thing we worry about is the battery [ in 5B ] , " explained Patrick Wood , the Skynet programme chief at Astrium .
" The team will be monitoring the charge on the lithium ion battery , and checking it is on external power .
Once we 've got a resumed launch time , we will go with our standard test sequence , " he told BBC News .
The World Cup of Bribery International Soccer Tarnished by Corruption Case
Top sports officials are alleged to have collected more than 18 million Swiss francs in bribes for TV and merchandising deals .
The soccer association FIFA is involved , and the case in Switzerland will expose a system of bribes -- and perhaps those who accepted them .
At some universities , administrators are taking a new approach to deciding where to put footpaths .
At first they do n't put footpaths anywhere ; they just let students walk across the grass to get where they need to go , wearing away the grass and creating rough tracks as they do so .
Then when it is clear where the popular tracks go the university can just tidy them up , put down some paving stones , and they have a path in the right place .
It 's called the Wisdom of Crowds .
The students decide where the paths go by just going about their everyday life , and the university taps into their preferences to design an environment that reflects exactly what the students would want to do .
That 's what we 've done here at Mr. Google 's Guidebook .
We track how people walk around , which signposts they follow , and that lets us put paths in the right place , just where you want them to be .
We can lead you just where you want to go ; lead you to interesting and even unexpected destinations that will provide you with just what you asked for , and more .
Mr. Google realized that most people do n't really want maps , they want guidebooks .
And he also realized how he could use those signposts to build a good guidebook .
When someone puts up a signpost it shows that they feel this destination is a place worth going to .
Mr. Google 's Guidebook is very well indexed , so when you look up something like " I would like to visit a peaceful country retreat " it takes you to a page of recommendations .
To generate these recommendations Mr. Google counted all the signposts that pointed to peaceful country retreats and pick those retreats that most signposts pointed to .
" Here " , he would say , " I recommend you go to Harburn House , or Green Mountain Bed and Breakfast " .
Mr. Google 's Guidebook became something of a sensation .
Once it was established , he put in a few advertisements alongside each question and made a pretty penny from it .
As I read further , a storm rose up in the west .
The candle flickered as the wind came in through the ill - fitting windows .
Maybe this forbidding atmosphere explains why the more I read the more I worried that there might be something a little sinister about our Mr. Google .
Mr. Google 's Guidebook has become very influential .
In fact , I understand he now has a cave somewhere in view of the mountains that is full of large and noisy engines , with powerful pistons cranking away to produce new versions every day .
That initial guide of his , so clean and tidy , has become a monstrous device like one of those machines designed by Mr. Goldberg or Mr. Robinson .
He claims that every edition of his guide " considers more than 500 million variables and 2 billion terms " .
It was late at night by the time I read this remarkable fact , and I 'd had several more glasses of sherry .
A particularly strong gust rattled the window and I stood up to close the shutters .
The wind blew the window open and I had to reach out to grab it .
It was then that I noticed in the distance a flash of flame and a column of thick black smoke rising in the distance from right near Mr. Google 's cave !
It looked positively diabolical .
I believe I actually cried out in shock .
After a tussle I got the shutters closed and , shaken , returned to my leatherbound armchair and took another sip to calm my nerves .
My mind was racing .
" Come on Whimsley " , I thought , " You 're just imagining things " .
How could there be anything sinister about the Guidebook ?
I opened a page of the biography at random and it set my mind somewhat at ease .
Here is what I read : Maybe that 's all it is then , I thought .
Maybe everyone wants to read about the Netflix Prize and no one wants to read 25 essays about the Long Tail .
Maybe I 've had one moment of startling insight amidst so much dross .
But somehow , as my mood plumbed new depths , my brain clung to a stubborn belief that the prettiest thing in Whimsley Hall is an ancient manuscript that sets out , with wit and panache , the problems with toilets .
This gem lies in a corner covered with grime and neglected by Mr. Google .
How could I possibly explain such gross inequity ?
Pondering this problem , I fell asleep in the chair and drifted into a strange dream ... I was standing with my mother in York ; one of many visits some years ago .
She was pointing to a Chinese take - away restaurant that occupied one narrow division of a long terrace of houses and shops on one of the old streets of that city . -
Look at that , she said , Why is that restaurant right where it is ?
Why does it go from here to here ( gesturing to the edges of the restaurant ) rather than some other place ?-
I have no idea .-
It 's because of the vikings .
Over a thousand years ago the land was divided , and then subdivided as it was passed down from father to sons .
Each son inherited a narrower strip , so that it had access to the road , and as a result property lines were narrow .
Over the years new buildings have been erected until the current use of land has nothing to do with the original , and yet the boundaries remain ; archaic , obsolete , and yet fixed .
Unless a new motorway comes through they may stay the same way for another thousand years . -
How strange , I commented .-
Not as strange as the egg rolls , she replied ... Then I was in a train , reading a newspaper article about Alfred Wainwright 's classic hand - written guides to the paths of the Lake District .
It explained that , while the routes of footpaths usually evolved over time rendering such guides as Wainwright 's obsolete , the very success of Mr. Wainwright 's magnificent effort had preserved their relevance .
People used the guides to follow the paths , cementing the routes in place for much longer than would have been the case without them .
I awoke with a start .
What an odd thing to remember .
Why now ?
My mother is in fine fettle - no worries there .
And Wainwright 's Guides ?
I had n't thought of them in years .
It must be something else that produced that dream .
And then I realized , it was all about Mr. Google 's Guidebook .
I struck my forehead , blinded by this insight , and rushed to the table .
Picking up the quill pen , I dipped it in the ink and began to write feverishly on the pad of paper lying there ... Mr. Google is lying !
( I wrote ) His Guidebook no longer reflects the paths set out by travellers as they navigate their lives .
It is no longer an outside observer of people 's wanderings .
Google 's success has changed the way people find their routes .
Here is the way it happens .
When a new cluster of destinations is built there may be a flurry of interest , with new signposts being erected pointing towards one or another of those competing locations .
And those signposts have their own dynamics , perhaps forming a power law as set out by Mr. Shirky or perhaps something different , as Mr. Shalizi has explained But that 's not the end of the story .
After some initial burst , no one makes new signposts to this cluster of destinations any more .
And no one uses the old signposts to select which particular destination to visit .
Instead everyone uses Mr. Google 's Guidebook .
It becomes the major determinant of the way people travel ; no longer a guide to an existing geography it now shapes the geography itself , becoming the most powerful force of all in many parts of the land .
So my Netflix Prize essay got selected by Mr. Google 's machines as one of the more interesting and insightful commentaries - the machines are perceptive , we must grant them that - and it soon appeared as number 3 on the list of recommended destinations for anyone looking for " Netflix Prize " , right after the official site itself .
And now no one is guided here by those few original links - the relevance of their effect is as vestigial as the effect of the Vikings ' property rules .
Mr. Google 's Guidebook has cemented the verdict in place long after the early discussion has lost its relevance , like the edges of the Chinese take - away and like Mr. Wainwright 's guides fixed the routes of the paths he charted .
With little new being written about the Netflix Prize the Guidebook is the major source of new journeys .
And so the Guidebook changes the pattern of the landscape from a rich , linked one with its power law shape ( or other shape ) .
Instead , there is a two stage process in the evolution of much of the landscape .
The first stage is a brief discussion , from which Mr. Google picks a few winners .
In the second stage , after that discussion has faded away , the continuing popularity of the winners is assured simply by their positioning in the Guidebook .
Mr. Google has singlehandedly changed the way people travel , changing the selection of destinations from an ongoing referendum to a brief discussion from which he anoints a few winners .
Mr. Google no longer gives you what you want , he selects a winner from the crowd and then tells you it 's what you wanted .
I was just about to put down the pen , exhausted now , when I heard a creak and the door to the library opened .
I lurched around to see coming through the door --- Mr. Google himself !
His face was no longer subservient as befits a butler .
Instead it was smirking .
And his teeth - surely they had not been so pointed before .
I shrank .
But Mr. Google did not attack me with a knife , or bite me in the neck .
Nothing so dramatic .
He simply looked over at my scribbled notes and sighed a world - weary sigh . -
You do n't understand do you sir ? -
What do you mean Google ?
I understand everything now . - Really ?
This document here ?
And what does that matter if no one reads it ?
And who decides whether anyone can come here to view it ?
Exactly how do you propose to publicize your absurd opinions if not through me ?
My shoulders sagged .
Defeat .
Of course , there was nothing I could do .
" So you 'll silence it then .
Keep people away .
My revelations will moulder , along with that masterpiece about the toilets " .- No ( said Google ) .
That 's what I mean - you really do n't understand .
You see , I do n't care if people come and look at these hen scratches or not .
Maybe they will , maybe they wo n't .
As long as I can sell a few advertisements on that page of my guidebook I really do n't care .
After all , what better praise for a Guidebook than to help people find out what 's wrong with it ?
Just leave your manuscript with me .
I 'll look after it .
He held out his hand , imperious now .
I felt disheveled after my long night .
My brain was spinning .
I could see no alternative .
In a vain attempt to maintain some self - respect I drew myself up to my full height and pulled back my shoulders , adopting a bearing appropriate for my class .
" All right Google .
Here you go .
Do n't lose it now . " " Thank you sir .
You can be sure I wo n't lose it .
I never do lose anything you know .
" I turned away from him and stumbled down the stairs .
I had ended up giving him an order , and he had accepted it .
Yet I could not shake the impression , even as he brought me a glass of sherry that evening in my sitting room , placing the silver tray beside me with deference , that Mr. Google - far from being a butler and travel guide - was more a master than a servant .
President Bush got hit with a curveball today as Martha Raddatz opted to ask about the deteriorating conditions in Afghanistan instead of the economy .
A visually agitated Bush went into an impassioned diatribe of how important it is to stick to our guns in Afghanistan and help secure the country .
I have to say that I agree fully with the President on this one .
It 's just too bad he 's virtually forgotten about the effort there , diverting vital resources to Iraq instead .

I 'm pleased with the Afghan army , that when they 're in the fight they 're good .
I wish we had completely eliminated the radicals who kill innocent people to achieve objectives , but that has n't happened yet .
And so I think it 's very much in our interests to continue helping the young democracy .
And we will .
Yes .
Obviously you 've got a follow - up .
Q But do you think we 're winning ?
Do you think we 're winning ?
THE PRESIDENT : I do , I think we 're making good progress .
I do , yes .
Q Can I just add to that , a couple weeks ago --
THE PRESIDENT : No , you can't .
This is the second follow - up .

You can't , no .
Q A couple weeks ago you said --

Q A couple weeks ago you said that in Iraq , in 2006 , you said we were winning and the strategy was working to keep up troop morale .
THE PRESIDENT : Yes .
Q How can we believe that you 're not doing the same thing here ?
THE PRESIDENT : You tried to ask me that question before .
It 's a repeat .
Look , I said --
Q No , I 'm talking --
THE PRESIDENT : Can I finish , please ?
The question you asked me before at the exclusive I gave you on the ranch was :
You said that we were winning in the past .
I also said that there was tough fighting .
Make sure you put the comments in place .
So what I 'm going to tell you now is , we 're making progress in Afghanistan , but there 's tough fighting .
I 'm under no illusions that this is n't tough .
I know full well we 're dealing with a determined enemy .
I believe it 's in our interest that we defeat that enemy .
And so , yes , we 're making progress .
But it 's also a tough battle .
We 're facing people who are willing to strap bombs on themselves and walk into places where the innocent dwell , or the innocent shop , and kill them .
Is it in our interest to confront these people now , whether it be in Afghanistan , or Iraq , or Europe , or anywhere else ?
And the answer is , absolutely , it 's in our interest .
And the notion that somehow we can let these people just kind of have their way or , you know , let 's do n't stir them up , is naive or disingenuous , and it 's not in our nation 's interests .
We are in a global struggle against thugs and killers .
And the United States of America has got to continue to take the lead .
And so in Afghanistan , yes , we 're making progress .
Does that mean that it 's over ?
No , it does n't mean it 's over .
We 're in a long struggle , as I 've told you many a time , against these jihadists .
You defeat them ultimately by the advance of democracy .
See , this is an ideological struggle .
These are n't isolated , law - enforcement moments .
We 're dealing with a group of ideologues who use asymmetrical warfare -- that means killing innocent people -- to try to achieve their objectives .
And one objective is to drive us out of Afghanistan , Iraq , the Middle East , or anywhere else where we try to confront them .
And so , yes , I mean , look -- is it tough ?
Yes , it 's tough .
Is it difficult ?
Absolutely .
Is it worth the fight ?
In my judgment , yes , it is .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- President Bush marked the fifth anniversary of the Iraq war on Wednesday by calling the debate over the conflict " understandable " but insisting that a continued U.S. presence there is crucial .
President Bush marks the fifth anniversary of the start of the Iraq war with a speech Wednesday at the Pentagon .
" The answers are clear to me , " Bush said in a speech at the Pentagon five years from the day the war began in 2003 .
" Removing Saddam Hussein from power was the right decision , and this is a fight America can and must win . "
Almost 4,000 American troops have died in the war , a painful toll that Bush acknowledged .
" No one would argue that this war has not come at a high cost in lives and treasure , but those costs are necessary when we consider the cost of a strategic victory for our enemies in Iraq , " the president said .
Watch Bush say how the war must be won »
Bush said victory in Iraq demonstrates American resolve and will prevent attacks on targets in the United States .
" Defeating this enemy in Iraq will make it less likely we will face this enemy here at home , " he said .
Bush contends the so - called troop surge he ordered in January 2007 has been a success and was necessary at a point when " the fight in Iraq was faltering . "
" The surge has done more than turn the situation in Iraq around ; it has opened the door to a major strategic victory in the broader war on terror , " he said .

Instead , Iraq has become the place where Arabs joined with Americans to drive al Qaeda out . "

He called Iraq the first place where Muslims have participated in a " large - scale uprising " against Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda .
" We will show that men and women who love liberty can defeat the terrorists , " Bush said .
" A free Iraq will fight terrorists rather than harbor them . "
Still , large - scale attacks by terrorists and insurgent groups continue in Iraq .
Bombings killed six Iraqis and wounded 51 in northeastern Baghdad and Mosul on Tuesday , and the death toll from a Monday suicide bombing in Karbala rose to 50 .
Bush said critics of the war -- such as Democratic presidential candidates Sens. Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton -- " can no longer credibly argue that we are losing in Iraq , so now they argue the war costs too much . "
Watch Obama blame war on Bush , Congress »
Earlier this month , two economists wrote a column suggesting that the war will wind up costing the United States more than $ 3 trillion .
The March 9 opinion piece in The Washington Post was authored by Joseph E. Stiglitz , a Nobel Prize - winning economist who was chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Clinton , and Linda J. Bilmes , a former chief financial officer at the U.S. Commerce Department .
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , D - Nevada , has cited the $ 3 trillion figure when criticizing the Bush administration 's position on the war .
In his speech , Bush called the projected cost " exaggerated . "
But he admitted more costs and tough fighting remain , pointing to recent battles against extremists in northern Iraq .
But he said any U.S. pullout would put peace at risk in the greater Mideast , emboldening al Qaeda and Iran .
Despite Bush 's arguments , the war remains unpopular with Americans .
In a CNN / Opinion Research Corp. poll conducted Friday through Sunday , fewer than one in three respondents -- 32 percent -- said they support the war , while 66 percent said they oppose it .
Sixty - one percent of those polled said the next president should remove most U.S. troops from Iraq " within a few months of taking office . "
Meanwhile , two of the world 's leading humanitarian groups said this week the situation in Iraq leaves little room for optimism .
" Despite claims that the security situation has improved in recent months , the human rights situation is disastrous , " Amnesty International says in a report titled " Carnage and Despair : Iraq Five Years On . "
And the International Committee of the Red Cross , in a report called " Iraq : No Let - up in the Humanitarian Crisis , " writes , " Despite limited improvements in security in some areas , armed violence is still having a disastrous impact . "

実は 「オブジェクト指向」というのは，あまり専門的な用語ではない．*4オブジェクト指向プログラミング( OOP )，オブジェクト指向設計( OOD ) ，オブジェクト指向分析( OOA ) などと，きちんと区別すべきだ．ただ口頭で話す時は「オブジェクト指向プログラミング」と言うのは冗長だしOOPと言っても理解してもらえない．しかたがないので省略して「オブジェクト指向」と言う時も少なくない．
ここで挙げるの は 「いわゆるオブジェクト指向」であって，そのほとんどはOODが基本となっていることが多いようだ．

Where Have All the Macroeconomists Gone ?
A reporter friend of mine recently asked me for a short list of academic economists he should call to better understand the current financial and economic mess .
I found it a more difficult question than it should be .
It really has been quite striking how silent most economists have been in this hour of need .
There are , of course , a few notable exceptions .
Paul Krugman ’s blog has been an interesting source of insight , and his recent column provides the clearest explanation of our current difficulties I have seen .
Doug Elmendorf at Brookings has provided some very insightful commentary on the mortgage mess , and Marty Feldstein has offered a very well - thought - out plan .
Economists like Karl Case and Robert Shiller can quite rightly tell us that they saw this coming years ago .
I ’m sure I ’ve missed others , but it remains striking that academic economists are barely visible during one of the most interesting economic disruptions in decades .
Yes , there is an enormous ocean of economic commentary out there , but a lot of it is either the self - interested blather of Wall Street economists , or political rhetoric parading as analysis .
( Yes : Republicans are worried that regulation may stifle innovation , while Democrats believe that regulation can help …
Oh , and what issue are we talking about ?
Does it matter ? )
Meanwhile our presidential candidates call for action , but ultimately only suggest that we should consider many proposals , and find some experts to ask about them .
Why have the best and the brightest barely dipped their toes in the water ?
1. Incentives : Krugman , citing Keynes , has argued that there is no incentive for a public intellectual to challenge the conventional wisdom .
Better to be conventionally wrong , than unconventionally right .
2. Career ladders :
Interestingly , some of the best analysis is coming from economic journalists , who are unencumbered by either the fight for tenure or post - tenure lethargy .
3. Crowding out :
The wisdom of crowds is at its heyday and experts have lost market share in the public square .
Everyone with a blog and ten minutes to spare is offering a view ( including yours truly ) , and this is crowding out thoughtful discussion .
4. Reputational market failure : Just as it is tough to identify a good mechanic , it is difficult to identify a good economist .
There are thousands of economics PhD’s , but perhaps only a few dozen with the penetrating insight the economy needs .
Unfortunately these folks are struggling to be heard .
5. Labor supply :
The success of economics over recent decades means that we simply have many more exciting ( and important ? ) issues to focus on .
6 . I ’m wrong : Academic economists have produced excellent policy - relevant analyses that are providing Bernanke with the ammunition he needs .
I would love to be convinced that this is true .
If you have written ( or read ) first - rate analyses — for a technical , policy , or popular audience — please add a link in the comments .
I suspect that # 4 may explain the absence of younger economists from the debate ; # 1 and # 5 seem too strong , but in the right direction ; and the problem with # 2 is that there is no clear alternative .

— Jay Leno
" It seems Monica Lewinsky is on the loose again , teaming up with HBO to do a documentary about her affair with Bill Clinton .
It 's not really a documentary .
It will be more of an oral history . "
— Jay Leno
SpritesMods .com Online whiteboard - Intro
Intro
While we all have our telephones , our PDAs , our laptops etc to jot down meetings , thoughts and scribbles , a decidedly low - tech device like a whiteboard has its place too .
It 's easy to use , it does n't use power , you can easily take a look at it without first turning it on and wrestling through an UI , and it 's intrinsically multi-user when hung in a room accessible to multiple people .
There 's a disadvantage common to such low - tech things as a whiteboard : it has no Ethernet - plug or anything so it is n't reachable online .
That 's a bit of a shame : especially when multiple people use the whiteboard , it can be useful to be able to go to a webbrowser and take a look at the whiteboard , and if needed , to leave a message for others to read .
How can we do that ?
Well , using the Internet to take a look at the whiteboard is n't that difficult : just take a webcam and point it at the board .
Writing it will be a bit more difficult : there 's something like a plotter needed for that .
I 'd like the solution to be lightweight : while a completely Borgified whiteboard has its charm too , I 'd like to alter mine as little as possible .
That 's why I decided to use an idea I saw first at the 24C3 : a way of hanging a pen using 2 rubber belts and two motors called a bipod .
Problem was that I had no info of that device ( I found the youtube - link while writing this article ) so I had to work from memory .

Members of Washington ’s military and defense establishment are expressing trepidation about Sen. Barack Obama , as the Illinois senator comes closer to winning the Democratic presidential nomination and leads in national polls to become commander in chief .
But his backers , including a former Air Force chief of staff , say the rookie senator believes in a strong military , and with it , a larger Army and Marine Corps .
“ Any military person who concludes he ’s a left - wing , hair - on - fire , Kumbaya child of the ‘ 60s has sadly misunderestimated him , to use George Bush ’s term , ” said retired Gen. Merrill McPeak .
Still , the mostly conservative retired officers , industry executives and current defense officials interviewed by The Washington Times cite Mr. Obama ’s lack of experience in national security .
They also point to his determination to pull American combat units from Iraq at a time when a troop surge has reduced violence , damaged al Qaeda and allowed the Iraqi government to progress toward Sunni - Shia - Kurd reconciliation .
“ We ’re very concerned about his apparent lack of understanding on the threat of radical Islam to the United States , ” said retired Air Force Lt. Gen .
Thomas McInerney , who is pro-Iraq war and a Fox News analyst .
“ A lot of retired senior officers feel the same way . ”
Mr. Obama also has stirred concern in national security circles by pledging to talk to the leaders of rogue nations , such as Iran and North Korea , without preconditions .
His urging of the Bush administration to conduct air strikes against terrorist targets in Pakistan without its approval is privately derided inside the Pentagon as the way to ruin relations with a good ally .
Pakistan will not allow U.S. combat troops to operate on its soil .
Questions about Mr. Obama ’s commander - in - chief qualifications have reached the campaign trail .
The Obama camp Wednesday sent out one of its advisers , former State Department official Susan Rice , to respond to charges from Sen. John McCain , the likely Republican nominee .
Meanwhile , Mark Penn , chief strategist for Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton , held a conference call with reporters to say the campaign will make the president ’s role as commander in chief a top issue leading up to March 4 primaries in Texas and Ohio .
Lawrence Korb , a military analyst at the Center for American Progress and one of a dozen or so national security advisers to the Obama campaign , rebutted the lack - of - experience complaint , saying neither President Bush nor John F. Kennedy could claim an extensive national security background before entering the White House .
Unlike Mr. Obama , though , both men served in the military .
“ I think Obama would be very good . ” Mr. Korb said .
“ I think the job of the commander in chief is to listen to all of the inputs he gets and then have a sense of world history and the way the world works , and to be able to apply the advice he gets from his military people .
Remember , Obama was one of the first ones to support a larger military , a larger Army and Marine Corps , well before the administration did . ”
Mr. Obama has visited Iraq and other nations as a Senate Foreign Relations Committee member .
No other Obama proposal brings more military criticism than his plan to bring home one to two combat brigades per month from Iraq — meaning all such units would be out by the end of 2009 , his first year in office .
A senior Pentagon official said an Obama swearing - in “ will give the Arab street the final victory , the best optics , and the ultimate in bragging rights .
They win .
We lose . ”
Retired Army Gen. John Keane , an architect of the Iraq troop surge , worries that talk of a U.S. pullout makes reconciliation more difficult .
Gen .
Keane has not endorsed any presidential candidate .
“ Anyone who is advocating a precipitous pullout of U.S. forces , believing this will be a catalyst for political progress , does not understand the realities of Iraq and the minds of the key political leaders , ” Gen. Keane told The Washington Times .
“ The U.S. military presence is the glue that is holding things together in Iraq and is the fundamental reason for the recent political progress .
If you remove this presence , the political leaders in Iraq will believe they are on their own and will fall prey to their own fears and paranoia . …
They will bunker down and the political progress will come to a dead stop . ”
Mr. Korb said Mr. Obama has a “ technically sound ” proposal for withdrawing troops .
He said that the candidate realized before the war , unlike many politicians in Washington , that things would go wrong in Iraq .
“ If you go back and you look at the speech he gave on Iraq before the war , I think that it was very well reasoned and well argued , ” the adviser said .
As a state senator in 2002 , Mr. Obama said , “ I know that even a successful war against Iraq will require a U.S. occupation of undetermined length , at undetermined cost , with undetermined consequences . ”
Gen. McPeak , who is an Obama campaign co-chairman , said the senator ’s intelligence will dazzle the Joint Chiefs of Staff .
“ I think Obama is going to be an outstanding commander in chief , not just an ordinary commander in chief , ” he told The Washington Times .
“ He has the potential to be one of the all - time greats .
I think the senior military will learn that about him starting from the first minute he occupies the Oval Office . …
There ’s no question that he is kind of scary smart .
I think just plain intelligence is a very good quality to have in a commander in chief . ”
Gen. McPeak said it is a “ fair comment ” that Mr. Obama is viewed skeptically by senior officers .
The general , who led the Air Force during the historic Desert Storm bombing of Iraq in 1991 , believes the second war was unnecessary .
He switched from Republican to Democrat in protest .
“ I think that ’s undoubtedly true that the surge has reduced the violence there , ” he said .
“ But at the strategic level they did not set the initial conditions properly and therefore we can never be a success . ”
Defense industry executives worry that Mr. Obama will end six years of defense budget increases and , as he has repeatedly said on the campaign trail and in debates , tap into war and military funds to support his plan for universal health care .
“ We ’ve got some trepidation .
There is no track record , ” said an industry executive of the first - term senator .
“ He ’s an unknown quantity and that scares us a little bit . ”
The National Journal ranked Mr. Obama as the Senate ’s most liberal member in 2007 , based partly on his string of votes in favor of amendments that mandated a combat troop pullout from Iraq .
Mr. Obama does , however , acknowledge that America is in a war against extremists .
“ The terrorists are at war with us , ” he said in “ The War We Need to Win , ” a major policy speech .
“ They seek to create a repressive caliphate .
To defeat this enemy , we must understand who we are fighting against , and what we are fighting for . ”
One of his five pillars for winning is , “ getting out of Iraq and on to the right battlefield in Afghanistan and Pakistan . ”
The Obama campaign has assembled a team of national security advisers , most of whom worked in the Clinton administration , including former national security adviser Anthony Lake .
To date , Mr. Obama has attracted few retired admirals and generals as supporters .
Mrs. Clinton has the backing of two dozen flag officers .
“ She knows and respects our armed forces , ” said Lee Feinstein , her campaign ’s national security director .
“ She is the person in this race who is most qualified to be commander in chief . ”
But Loren Thompson , who runs the Lexington Institute and stays in touch with defense industry executives , said Mr. Obama is difficult to categorize .
“ His views are all over the map depending on whether its nuclear proliferation , energy independence or the global war on terror , ” he said .
“ How many liberals say they are going to bomb al Qaeda in Pakistan no matter whether the Pakistanis like it or not ?
He ’s much harder to pin down . ”

The level of privacy offered by search engines is generally woeful .
Last year , the three big players ( Google , Yahoo ! and MSN ) made some improvements by limiting the duration for full retention of logs about who has searched and what they 've searched for .
That means that after a year or two , it would be harder — though probably not impossible — for the major search engines and their advertising partners to reconstruct a complete history of your searches .
Ask.com went further with their AskEraser feature , which allows users to have their logs deleted and to opt - out of being tracked ( Ask.com could have done better by finding a way for opt - out to be available without a cookie ) .
Despite these improvements , the average Internet user still has very little privacy for their search history .
We have documented the measures you can take to protect yourself , but they are n't all that simple .
So it 's exciting to report that one small search engine is experimenting with ways to be an aide , rather than a threat , to privacy .
PrivacyFinder is a research project at the CMU Usable Privacy and Security Laboratory ( full disclosure : Lorrie Cranor , who heads the lab , is also on the EFF Board ) .
It offers an interface to Yahoo ! and Google , but with two notable improvements : an excellent logging / data retention policy , and a feature that shows the user information about sites ' privacy policies along with the search results .
That way , if two sites offer the same service but one of them is better from a privacy point of view , the user will see that quickly .
The Privacy Finder researchers tell us they 've observed that people will , for instance , pay more for an item from an online store if they can see that it has an excellent privacy policy .
Privacy Finder seems to be making productive use of P3P , an old privacy standard that has , in many other respects , fallen short of expectations .
If you run a search on the site , you can quickly see when one result matches your standards and others do n't .
Privacyfinder 's logging policy is amongst the best in the industry ( Ixquick is also first - rate ) .
Privacyfinder only keeps search records for a week , unless the user explicitly opts in to being tracked .
Because the CMU Laboratory wants to do research on the use of search engines , it 's offering prizes for people who are willing to be tracked for research purposes .
That 's the way we like to see it done .
Meanwhile , several other developments are in the works .
New York State legislators have been talking about taking parts of the search privacy problem into their own hands .
There are rumors of new startups planning to enter the " privacy search " market .
And EFF is working on a scorecard for systematically evaluating the effectiveness of various privacy measures at search engines .
Stay tuned to Deeplinks for future developments !
Leander Paes , who has saved India from several Davis Cup disasters and a medal hope at the Beijing Olympic Games in August , is going to play a miracle man who helps school kids in cartoon television series called The Magic Racquet .
Not much has been disclosed about the story line .
Paes will play roughly his own age and will sport tennis gear .
The story will revolve around a school with three to five central characters between the age group of 6 to 10 .
There are also plans to include other sporting stars as guests in a few episodes since the objective is to promote sports in general .
The 26 half - hour episodes project will be a collaboration between Paes ’s company , Leander Sport Private Limited , and Mumbai - based Maya Entertainment Limited and is an endeavor in promoting values of an active outdoor lifestyle , healthy eating habits and physical fitness .
“ It pains me when I see kids today spending a lot of time in front of TV sets and on unhealthy diets .
As a father and national sports figure , I feel it is my duty to impart love for sports and an active lifestyle so the next generation can develop the mindset of champions , both on and off the field , ” says Paes , the comic superhero .
Jai Natarajan , executive vice - president and business head of MEL , says that there was never a doubt about defining Leander ’s role in the series .
“ We wanted him to be himself .
Paes ’ creative instincts , friendly screen presence and strong value system make him an ideal catalyst for promoting healthy attitude among kids . ”
The animated series will not be restricted to the Indian audience ; it will be thrown open to the world market through TV , DVD , mobisodes and other future technologies .
In the Indian market , it will to choose between the two Disney channels , Cartoon Network and Pogo , and Nick .
The first episode of the series is likely to go on air in the next six months .
Darwin = Hitler Expelled does n't get Darwin — or intelligent design .
Paley 's bull terrier .
The most bizarre thing about the new intelligent - design propaganda film Expelled : No Intelligence Allowed is n't that former Nixon speechwriter Ben Stein is being paid to extol a pseudoscience whose hypotheses can't be tested ( everyone has a price ) , or that the film compares science with Nazism and Stalinism ( though it does , repeatedly and remorselessly ) .
What 's truly weird is that the filmmakers do n't seem to understand the tenets of intelligent design .
Proponents of intelligent design — which is essentially a legal strategy , developed in the wake of a Supreme Court decision rejecting the teaching of creationism in public schools — try to discern traces of an intelligent designer in the universe and in living things .
Crucially , however , the " theory " remains agnostic as to the identity of that designer .
This was an important component of the legal underpinning of the movement :
If intelligent - design proponents ever hinted that the designer was God , the teaching of intelligent design in schools would , like the teaching of creationism , constitute an infringement on the First Amendment 's Establishment Clause .
At the same time , though , not naming the designer meant that intelligent - design proponents like Michael Behe had to allow the possibility that their designer is one of many gods , or even an intellectually superior alien .
( This problem was memorably satirized by followers of the almighty Flying Spaghetti Monster . )
So when Richard Dawkins , an evolutionary biologist and atheist who is a prominent critic of intelligent design , concedes to Stein in Expelled that he is open to the idea that aliens may have seeded our planet with life , intelligent design has actually scored a point ( even if Dawkins never argues that an alien visitation could be somehow inferred from the evidence , and even though the theory of natural selection is n't particularly preoccupied with how life first began ) .
But this modest victory means nothing to the movie 's target audience of evangelical Christians , so Stein takes the intellectually bankrupt way out and makes vicious fun of Dawkins for believing in aliens .
Intellectual bankruptcy is in fact the defining characteristic of Expelled .
Stein flits around the country collecting risibly anecdotal evidence of a conspiracy to choke academic freedom ( apparently tenure - track professors have an inalienable right to spend their time writing intelligent - design textbooks instead of peer - reviewed journal articles , and unpaid research associates at the Smithsonian have a right to ... well , I 'm not exactly sure what Richard von Sternberg was n't permitted to do ) , but he never bothers to define his terms .
You wo n't learn the definition of intelligent design from this movie , much less anything about the theory of evolution by means of natural selection .
Instead , you 'll be told that scientists are all vehement atheists .
Not a single agnostic or religious person who accepts the theory of natural selection appears in the film .
You 'll learn that the Discovery Institute 's headquarters in downtown Seattle are modestly sized , and that Ben Stein had a conspicuously difficult time locating them .
( The filmmakers go to great lengths to persuade you they received no funding from the think tank that normally holds a monopoly on efforts to publicize intelligent design .
By the way , 10 of the last 10 posts on the Discovery Institute 's blog Evolution News & Views are about Expelled — including " Discovery Salutes Expelled " and " Is There a Connection Between Hitler and Darwin ? " )
Clumsy montages of archival film clips will try to convince you that the science departments of research universities are like the Soviet Union , East Germany , and Communist China all rolled up in one ivory tower .
And , most memorably , you 'll be warned that accepting Darwin 's theory of natural selection is a slippery slope that will soon have you espousing eugenics , embracing racial purity and genocide , and sieg - heiling Hitler himself .
Comparing one 's opponent to Hitler is a debate technique so unsophisticated it would get you laughed off an internet message board .
( The Discovery Institute does n't allow comments on its blog . )
Expelled does n't resort to this evolution - leads - to - Hitlerism hysteria in passing .
It devotes a solid 20 minutes of its running time to a sequence in which Stein , who is Jewish , visits a German hospital where Nazis starved , murdered , and cremated the physically and mentally disabled .
Asked what inspired this cruelty , a random museum docent ( who does n't speak English very well ) softly replies , " Darwinism . "
Never mind that scientific theories do not stand or fall depending on whether homicidal dictators wantonly misinterpret them , or that Charles Darwin was never a proponent of social Darwinism , or that he contributed only a modest portion of modern evolutionary theory .
Just compare scientists to Nazis — that 'll , uh , really convince everyone that intelligent design should be welcomed as a legitimate scientific pursuit .
If Expelled is the best argument the intelligent - design crowd can muster , thinking people who hope that the next generation will be taught the scientific method — not lazy , religiously motivated shortcuts like intelligent design — can breathe a sigh of relief .

March 10 , 2008  -- Comedian and author Al Franken is one step closer to realizing his goal of becoming the next U.S. senator from the state of Minnesota .
Mike Ciresi , Franken 's chief competitor for the nomination of the Democratic Farmer Labor party ( DFL ) , announced Monday that he is withdrawing from the race , paving the way for Franken to do battle with incumbent Republican Sen.
Norm Coleman this fall .
" I am announcing today my withdrawal from the contest for the DFL endorsement and the conclusion of my candidacy for the U.S. Senate , " Ciresi said .
" In my judgment , continuing the endorsement race would only lead to an unnecessary floor fight .
It is time to step aside . "
Ciresi , a wealthy trial lawyer known for winning a large 1998 settlement against the tobacco industry , entered the race last spring , but was never able to match Franken 's fundraising successes .
The former " Saturday Night Live " comedian , radio talk show host , and author not only won the fundraising battle , but also earned the coveted support of major labor unions .
Upon leaving the race , Ciresi encouraged his supporters " to remain committed to changing the direction of our nation and to support candidates of their choice .
" I firmly believe that America 's best days are still ahead of us , " he said .
" As we return to private life , I will continue my efforts , as I have my entire life , to work with others in contributing to the common good of our state and nation . "
A spokesperson for Franken said that the candidate would not be commenting on Ciresi 's withdrawal until the two have had a chance to speak .
If Franken manages to defeat Coleman this fall , he would not be the first celebrity - turned - politician to win elected office in Minnesota .
In 1998 , the Land of 10,000 Lakes chose former professional wrestler Jesse " The Body " Ventura to serve as governor .
Dubner and Levitt have an article in the NYTimes with three examples of the law of unintended consequences , the Americans with Disabilities
Act made it more costly to hire people with disabilities and reduced their employment , ancient Jewish sabbatical law intended to help the poor has made them worse off , and the endangered species act has resulted in habitat destruction .
In light of this Andrew Gelman asks a deep question , What kind of law is the " law of unintended consequences ? "
The law of unintended consequences is what happens when a simple system tries to regulate a complex system .
The political system is simple , it operates with limited information ( rational ignorance ) , short time horizons , low feedback , and poor and misaligned incentives .
Society in contrast is a complex , evolving , high - feedback , incentive - driven system .
When a simple system tries to regulate a complex system you often get unintended consequences .
Unintended consequences are not restricted to government regulation of society but can also happen when government tries to regulate other complex systems such as the ecosystem ( e.g. fire prevention policy that reduces forest diversity and increases mass fires , dam building that destroys wet lands and makes floods more likely etc. )
Unintended consequences can even happen in the attempted regulation of complex physical systems ( here is a classic example involving turbulence ) .
The fact that unintended consequences of government regulation are usually ( but not always or necessarily ) negative is not an accident .
A regulation requiring apartments to have air - conditioning , for example , pushes the rental contract against the landlord and in favor of the tenant but the landlord can easily push back by raising the rent and in so doing will create a situation where both the landlord and tenant are worse off .
More generally , when regulation pushes against incentives , incentives tend to push back creating unintended consequences .
Not all regulation pushes against incentives , some regulations try to change incentives but incentives are complex and constraints change so even incentive - driven regulations can have unintended consequences .
Does the law of unintended consequences mean that the government should never try to regulate complex systems ?
No , of course not , but it does mean that regulators should be humble ( no trying to remake man and society ) and the hurdle for regulation should be high .
Microsoft to Yahoo : Two Days to Respond or Else !
Sources at Yahoo tell me that Microsoft made its most recent overtures right after Yahoo announced its earnings Tuesday and then told Yahoo execs they had two days to respond or Microsoft would go public with the offer .
When Yahoo balked at the heavy - handed tactic , guess what ?
Microsoft went public .
Now Yahoo is scrambling to figure out a response to the overture , but is looking for any other option but Microsoft .
A number of top executives I spoke to today were flabbergasted by what is essentially a hostile move by Microsoft .
Yahoo’s Jerry Yang has been rebuffing such advances , made both privately and in veiled references in public by Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer .
“ I woke up this morning and could n’t believe that they did it , ” said one exec .
“ They had made a lot of overtures , but this was astonishing .
I could not believe Microsoft would be so aggressive . ”
Believe it .

Glenn Beck :
The economic asteroid will first hit America when the Medicare trust fund becomes insolvent in 2019 .
NEW YORK ( CNN ) --
Let 's say a giant asteroid was headed toward Earth right now and experts say it has a good chance of ending civilization as we know it .
Let 's also say that we 've known about this asteroid for years but even as it gets closer and closer our leaders do nothing .
" Do n't worry , " they tell us , " The next administration will figure something out . "
With the future of our country at stake , would Americans really sit back and tolerate that kind of inaction ?
Of course not -- we'd be sharpening our pitchforks and demanding answers .
Well there may not be a space asteroid heading toward us , but there is an economic one -- and the threat to our future is just as severe .
You might think that I 'm talking about the recession ( sorry : potential recession ) or credit crisis , but I 'm thinking bigger .
Much , much bigger .
Let me give you three numbers that will put this economic asteroid into perspective : $ 200 billion , $ 14.1 trillion , and $ 53 trillion .
$ 200 billion is the approximate total amount of write - downs announced so far as a result of the current credit crisis .
$ 14.1 trillion is the size of the entire U.S. economy
And $ 53 trillion is ( drum roll please ) the approximate size of this country 's bill for the Social Security and Medicare promises we 've made .
While no one will ever mistake me for Alan Greenspan , it seems to me that the third number is quite a bit larger than the other two .
It also seems very few people care .
According to the latest Social Security and Medicare Trustees report ( and I use that term loosely since it has the word " trust " in it ) released earlier this week , the economic asteroid will first make impact in the year 2019 when the Medicaid trust fund becomes insolvent .
Only an immediate 122 percent increase in Medicare taxes and a 26 percent increase in Social Security taxes can prevent ( or more likely , delay ) its impact .
Realizing that Americans have become pretty much numb to these kinds of ridiculous sounding proposals , U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson tried to up the ante this week .
" Without change , " he said , " Rising costs will drive government spending to unprecedented levels , consume nearly all projected federal revenues , and threaten America 's future prosperity . "
Now , I know we 're all worried about important sounding things that none of us understand , like CDO's , SIV's , and Credit Default Swaps , but did you hear what our Treasury Secretary just said ?
" Rising costs will ... consume nearly all projected federal revenues ... "
Translation : Every single tax dollar that is sent to Washington will be used to pay for just these two programs .
That means no money is left for anything else .
Nothing .
No Department of Defense or Homeland Security , no Department of Energy , no Department of Justice , no Environmental Protection Agency , no Internal Revenue Service .
Actually , knowing our government , they 'd probably keep the IRS going somehow .
Of course , none of this is exactly breaking news .
Our leaders have known about this rapidly approaching asteroid for years now and they 've done nothing but debate it .
At the same time , I 'm a realist .
I understand that this stuff is " the third rail of politics , " but our leaders ' negligence on this issue is damn near criminal .
No , correction , it is criminal .
Americans are n't afraid of the truth .
In fact , we crave the truth only slightly more than we crave a leader who will actually give it to us .
But part of the problem with this issue is that numbers followed by 12 zeroes are n't very relatable to the average American .
Instead , try this on for size .
A million seconds is 12 days .
A billion seconds is 32 years .
A trillion seconds is 32,000 years .
And 53 trillion seconds ?
1.7 million years .
In an article that will appear in an upcoming issue of my magazine , Fusion , former Comptroller General of the United States David Walker tries a different tactic .
He writes that our unfunded promises translate into " an IOU of around $ 455,000 per American household . "
Wow .
Does the size of our debt hit home now ?
The America that I know does n't sit around waiting for someone to rescue it from disaster .
Besides , who do we expect to swoop in and save the day ?
Congress ?
The president ?
Please -- they 're not only the ones who put the asteroid into space , they 've also been making it bigger with irresponsible spending on everything from prescription drugs to billions in rebate checks and bailouts .
Bruce Willis and Tommy Lee Jones ?
They 're more likely to be on Social Security than to save it .
And that leaves only us : We the People .
Like every other crisis we face , it 's up to us to save ourselves .
But how ?
Be honest , no matter what side of the political aisle you 're on , it 's obvious that our financial deficit is dwarfed only by the deficit of trust we have in our leaders .
I 'm willing to do the right thing for our future , I 'm willing to sacrifice , but not when I believe that our leaders will do nothing but make the asteroid even larger .

PJoe Mahon rotesters staged an act of civil disobedience at Minnesota ’s largest military contractor Wednesday morning .
The action at Alliant Techsystems in Edina , Minn. , led to 28 arrests .
Approximately 250 people participated in the protest .
Not all protesters participated in civil disobedience , which consisted of trespassing on the grounds of Alliant ’s corporate headquarters .
“ We ’re sort of an inspection team looking for weapons of mass indiscriminate destruction , ” said Marv Davidov , a longtime activist and organizer of the action , during instructions to participants .
“ The officials at Alliant Tech were not very proactive in their response to our inspection , ” said Michael Brown , a University philosophy graduate student who participated in the action and was arrested .
Brown said his mother Katie , who currently teaches philosophy at the University , also took part in the incident .
The trespassers carried a letter to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Paul David Miller asking to examine records on production of depleted uranium weapons .
Upon entering , they were arrested .
Activists claim depleted uranium shells , frequently used as antitank weapons in the first gulf war , are a cause of health problems such as birth defects in Iraq and the much - disputed “ Gulf War Syndrome . ”
The U.S. military used more than 100,000 depleted uranium shells during the first war .
Upon impact , some material is vaporized and can be harmful if inhaled .
Wednesday ’s protest featured a speech by Carol Nauheimer , whose son served on cleanup operations in Kuwait after the war and later died of leukemia she believes was caused by exposure to depleted uranium .
When she visited her son in the military hospital , Nauheimer said , “ He told me , ‘ Remember , mom , I know this started in that desert . ’ “
Friends for a Nonviolent World member Phil Steger , who has visited Iraq several times and toured hospitals , claimed the incidence of leukemia in Iraq is up 600 percent to 1000 percent since 1991 .
“ Depleted uranium most clearly violates international law that we ’ve signed onto , ” Brown said .
A statement issued to the media by Alliant read , “ ( Alliant ) does not produce or process depleted uranium Ö material .
We do , however , produce one round that is ( depleted uranium ) capable .
The ( depleted uranium ) material Ö is provided by the government . ”
Alliant has produced more than 15 million such shells .
The company has also stated depleted uranium is not dangerous because of its radioactivity but rather because of its toxicity as a heavy metal .
Aside from the controversial depleted uranium shells , Alliant makes other weapons and products for the government .
Alliant is the Pentagon ’s largest ammunition producer and its sole provider of small - arms ammunition for rifles .
The company also produces half the medium - caliber rounds used in larger guns .
With the acquisition of Thiokol Propulsion in 2001 , Alliant became the major producer of solid fuel rockets , used in many varieties of missiles as well as for NASA .
The company also produces precision munitions such as global positioning system - guided bombs .
Along with its rocket business , this makes missile defense a major growth opportunity for the company , according to investor information on its Web site .
The company also produces cluster bombs , a target of peace groups since the Vietnam War because many go unexploded and can injure civilians .
Alliant also produced antipersonnel land mines in the past , though it no longer does so .
Overall , Alliant is the 25th - largest contractor for the U.S. Defense department , receiving $ 674 million in contracts for 2002 .
The company totaled $ 1.8 billion in sales in 2002 and expects to do $ 2.1 billion for fiscal year 2003 .
Alliant started in 1991 when Honeywell spun off its weapons business after the end of the Cold War .
Prior to that , Honeywell had been a target of protesters since the Vietnam War era .
Davidov began the “ Honeywell project ” in 1968 and has conducted weekly vigils at Alliant ’s headquarters since 1996 .
The vigils do not usually include civil disobedience , but Wednesday ’s action was organized in response to the new war and Nauheimer ’s wish to speak out .
Nauheimer ’s daughter Wendy was among those arrested Wednesday .
The actions were marked by restraint by both demonstrators and Edina police , who have become used to the protests at Alliant .
“ I want to stress that the police are not the issue here , ” Alliant action member Tom Bottolene said , addressing those preparing for the action .
“ When we focus on them , we lose focus on Alliant . ”
“ It was a lot more ho - dunk than I thought it would be , ” said Christine Gamm , who graduated last spring from the College of St. Benedict and St. John ’s University in peace studies .
“ It ’s always the hope that you would be able to act out in a democracy and hold your community and businesses responsible and not get arrested , but I did , and I ’m glad I did it , ” Gamm said .
Those arrested face up to three months in prison or a $ 700 fine .
Davidov said in all the years he ’s been protesting at Honeywell and Alliant there have been 2,700 arrests , but those arrested typically only receive community service or a small fine .
“ Civil disobedience is never pleasant , people do it as an act of conscience and the Minnesota Constitution protects acts of conscience , ” Brown said .

Reeling from defeats in New Hampshire and Iowa , Mitt Romney suspended TV advertising in South Carolina and Florida on Wednesday , a money - saving move that laid bare the dire condition of his run for the White House .
After a year of sparing virtually no expense in his quest for the Republican nomination , Romney ’s pullback amounted to an extraordinary retreat in two states that will hold crucial primaries this month -- even though he could resume advertising on short notice .
Romney ’s losses to Mike Huckabee in the Iowa caucuses and John McCain in the New Hampshire primary have wrecked his campaign strategy .
He was counting on victories in those contests to vault him to the nomination .
A day after the setback in New Hampshire , Romney turned Wednesday to another state to rescue his candidacy : Michigan .
He grew up there , and his father , George Romney , was its governor from 1963 to 1969 .
Advertisement
“ I care about Michigan , ” Romney told a crowd here at Grand Valley State University .
“ For me , it ’s personal . ”
Michigan ’s primary will take place Tuesday , followed four days later by South Carolina ’s .
Florida ’s primary is Jan. 29 .
But Romney , former governor of Massachusetts , faces a fiercely contested race in Michigan , a state that McCain won in his 2000 presidential bid .
Basking in his New Hampshire victory , McCain arrived in Grand Rapids hours before Romney on Wednesday .
Like Romney , he salted his remarks with plans to remedy Michigan ’s ailing economy .
The state ’s 7.4 % unemployment rate is the highest in the nation .

“ There are tough times here in the heartland of America , ” the Arizona senator told several hundred supporters in a Grand Rapids airport hangar .
Huckabee , too , poses a challenge to Romney in Michigan .
A former Southern Baptist minister , he has a natural kinship with many evangelicals in the state ’s rural areas .
On Wednesday , he started airing an ad in Michigan that draws a contrast between his folksy style and Romney ’s more staid corporate image .
“ I ’m Mike Huckabee , and I approved this message , because I believe most Americans want their next president to remind them of the guy they work with -- not the guy who laid them off , ” the former Arkansas governor says in the ad .
With the Iowa and New Hampshire disappointments threatening to undercut his fundraising , Romney tried to show that he remained competitive .
Romney met Wednesday morning in Boston with several hundred people who were soliciting donations by telephone at rows of tables in a vast convention center showroom .
Advertisement
“ Hit the phones today , ” Romney told the group .
“ Make all the promises you have to . ”
The event was a replay of the “ national call day ” that Romney held a year ago to demonstrate his viability as he launched his campaign .
Seeking to put the best spin on a bad situation , Romney told the group that he had won more votes in Iowa and New Hampshire combined than any of his rivals had -- even if he finished second in both contests .
He also mentioned his sweep of the Republican caucuses in Wyoming , a sparsely populated state where his opponents had not bothered to campaign .
Wandering among the tables of callers , Romney picked up a phone and told a supporter to keep faith .
Advertisement
“ It ’s not a perfect start , but it ’s a good start , ” he said .
Later , he told reporters the race remained fluid .
The party nomination , Romney said , would go to the candidate with “ the staying power to go the distance ” in all 50 states .
“ I think we ’re used to a political environment where everything ’s decided after one or two primaries , ” he said .
“ That ’s not the case .
This is going to be a much longer process . ”
In Boston and Grand Rapids , Romney amended his stump speech -- already retooled after his Iowa defeat -- with an exhaustive review of his Michigan ties .
He has visited every county in the state .
His wife , Ann , was born in Oak Park , and one of their sons , Josh , in Pontiac .

Romney recalled that his first job after high school was as a plant guard at Chrysler .
He described the automobile industry as “ part of my DNA . ”
At a voter forum in Grand Rapids , Romney reminisced about campaigning for his father , a onetime president of American Motors , at county fair booths when George Romney ran for governor in 1962 .
A local Romney supporter , Phil Vanden Berg , told Romney that his own father used to drive an AMC Rambler .
“ I ’ve got a ’ 62 Rambler in my garage , ” Romney told him with a chuckle .
As Romney , McCain and Huckabee kicked off their Michigan campaigns , another Republican candidate , former New York Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani , stuck to Florida , where he hopes to score his first victory .

In Melbourne , Fla. , a bomb threat led police to evacuate dozens of Giuliani supporters from a campaign event in a corporate office .
Giuliani ’s campaign moved the event to an airport hangar at a nearby flight school .

I live in a Latin American neo-populist petrocracy .
For the last decade , my government ’s economic officials have pledged themselves to the “ comprehensive , humanist , endogenous and socialist development of the nation ” , whatever that means .
Perhaps that gobbledygook just means that in Venezuela it is much easier to fetch a bottle of premium Scotch whisky at any low - income neighborhood ’s supermarket than a bottle of milk , a pound of sugar or a dozen of eggs .
Paradoxically , the local branch of Audi set an all - time Latin American sales record during 2007 by catching a 22 % share of the region ’s luxury cars market .
To the average Venezuelan citizen , “ petropolitics ” is not just another catchy word .
Despite the hard fact that our main customer is the U.S. , my oil - rich country ’s notoriously outspoken leader is the perfect embodiment of anti-Americanism in our continent .
To say that American motorists end up paying for Venezuela ’s Russian Sukhoi US 28 Soviet - era jet fighters and hundreds of thousands of Kalashnikovs assault rifles is not an overstatement .
The hard fact is that , no matter how “ humanist ” and “ endogenous ” a petrostate ’s welfare and social policies are conceived , oil just does not create jobs .
On the contrary , it destroys most other sectors of the economy .
Its most distorting effect is pushing up the real exchange rate , lessening incentives for almost any other industrial activity .
Why produce your own food , for example , if you can import it ?
How can any other kind of export industry be developed if the inflow of petrodollars hampers manufacturing ?
With all that oil wealth concentrated in the state , you can only witness how “ clientele politics ” , voracious bureaucracy and crony capitalism pervade every corner of our society .
As Tina Rosenberg wrote in “ The Perils of Petrocracy ” ( The New York Times , 11-04-2007 ) , “ those in power distribute oil money to stay in power .
Thus oil states tend to be highly corrupt ” .
“ Comprehensive , humanist and socialist ” stance notwithstanding , I would add .
Populism and petropolitics have lately drawn the interest of many scholars and commentators who have indisputably attained a keener understanding of both subjects than mine , hence I will not delve into all the consequences of those terms when they concur in a Latin American country with 27.7 million inhabitants , a GDP of $ 140 mm and , according to government sources , a 13.2 % level of unemployment .
I will rather follow Yogi Berra ’s word of advice , “ you can observe a lot by watching ” how daily life goes by in a populist petrocracy such as the one I live in .
In consequence , allow me to contribute to a better knowledge of Venezuela ’s current economic plight by pointing at an “ Orwellian ” innovation that I have designated “ populist newspeak . ”
When Mr. George Orwell coined the word “ newspeak ” he was obviously thinking of full - blown totalitarian regimes , not erratic Latin American populism .
To everyone ’s surprise , Mr. Chávez has plundered “ newspeak ” usages and twisted them into illiberal democracy ’s conventional rhetoric .
A remarkable achievement , let us be fair .
That said , I think it ’s high time for a digression directed at taking a better hold of my contention .
Consider breakfast .
My breakfast , to be exact .
It ’s been months since I have had an oatmeal breakfast or a nice cup of espresso with a drop of milk because coffee and milk has literally vanished from supermarkets ’ shelves since last November .
And that includes “ Mercal ” , the government ’s supermarket network where the poor are supposed to buy food at subsidized low prices
The reason ?
Stiff price controls , of course , and fixed currency rates that have been going on for 5 years , too .
Read more about the effects of Price Controls in an article by Hugh Rockoff in the Concise Encyclopedia of Economics .
See also the discussion of how fixed exchange rates work in the CEE article on the Gold Standard by Michael Bordo .
I must confess that the very mention of price controls makes me drool at the thought of black beans and precooked corn flour , two staples absolutely essential in our spicy and usually inexpensive cocina criolla ( Creole cuisine ) that , according to señora Luz , the Dominican immigrant lady married to my office building ’s Colombian janitor , I am not the only one to miss .
Early on February , an outburst of looting broke in Sabaneta , Mr. Chávez ’s small hometown in southwestern Venezuela .
Two hundred regular army troops had to be sent in to avoid further looting of the local “ Mercal ’s ” facilities .
The enraged looters accused corrupt supermarket officials of hoarding subsidized basic foods and then trying to sell them above controlled prices .
As isolated as it was , the whole episode was reminiscent of the bloody riots that erupted in Caracas in 1989 with a death toll of some 700 people .
But , please , do n’t take it from me , take it from the host of foreign left - leaning correspondents who now appear to be utterly surprised by the onslaught of criticism that Mr. Chávez is facing , even from his own supporters , about a list of “ petty ” domestic worries such as violent crime and shortages of basic foods .
An economic crisis is rapidly playing out when it should be the best of times for Venezuela , a country endowed with the largest conventional oil reserves outside the Middle East and with oil prices verging on global record highs .
Going back to price controls and “ newspeak ” , here is what Mr. Chávez said in his Sunday TV show back on January 20th :
In the same breath , Mr. Chávez both accepted that price controls lead to shortages and blamed shortages on producers ’ treachery .
Wry blogger “ Quico ” Toro , who holds a Political Sciences Master degree , reaching out to a large following among Venezuela ’s youth , writes that ,
In 1984 , George Orwell wrote :
That passage could have come straight out the “ Understanding Comprehensive , Humanist , Endogenous and Socialist Development Handbook ” .
Orwell ’s prescience is still scary , is n’t it ?
Officials at Rock Port , Missouri , christened a four - turbine wind farm this week , making Rock Port the first U.S. city to get 100 % of its electricity from wind power .
The $ 90 million Loess Hills Wind Farm , built by the Wind Capital Group generates five megawatts each day , more than enough for this town of 1,300 .
The wind farm consists of four Suzlon 1.25 - megawatt wind turbines .
In fact , the farm is producing enough energy to power a second town of Rock Port ’s size .
Missouri Joint Municipal Utilities will buy excess power from the farm , expected to eventually generate 16 million kilowatt hours of electricity per year .
To celebrate being America ’s first wind - powered community , Rock Port , which is located in the far northwest corner of Missouri , will host a “ Green Switch ” celebration on Friday .

On Thursday , Chairman John Conyers ' House Judiciary Committee held a hearing at which Attorney General Michael Mukasey said that he would not investigate torture ( video ) or warrantless spying ( video ) , he would not enforce contempt citations ( video ) , and he would treat Justice Department opinions as providing immunity for crimes ( report ) .
None of this was new , but perhaps it touched something in Conyers that had not been touched before .
Following the hearing , he and two staffers met for an hour and 15 minutes with two members of Code Pink to discuss impeachment .
Conyers expressed fear of what might happen following an impeachment , fear of installing a Bush replacement or losing an election .
The " corporate power structure " , he said , would not allow impeachment without unleashing " blowback . "
Conyers told Ellen Taylor and Manijeh Saba : " You need to be more than brave and courageous .
You need to be smart . "
Their response ?
They are asking people who care about justice to help them let Conyers know that the smart thing right now would be bravery and courage .
On Rosa Parks ' birthday last week , Leslie Angeline began a fast for impeachment .
Taylor and over 20 other activists have joined the fast .
Conyers has agreed to meet with Angeline to discuss impeachment on Tuesday .
The Chairman told Taylor and Saba that he is listening to several advocates for impeachment , including Liz Holtzman and this author , and asked " So how would it look if I allowed two women to push me over the edge ? "
Conyers leaned out of his chair for dramatic effect .
A number of organizations will be sending their members this alert Monday morning :
Let 's push Conyers over the edge by flooding his office with phone calls , faxes , and Emails on Monday and Tuesday .
Let him know that only impeachment hearings
1 - will make it on TV ,
2 - will force compliance with subpoenas by eliminating " executive privilege " ,
3 - will hold brazen criminals accountable , and
4 - will convince voters that Democrats care about the Constitution .

Angeline , whose father was on the original Freedom Riders bus that was firebombed in Anniston , Ala. , in 1961 began her fast and a sit- in in Conyers ' office on Rosa Parks ' birthday , and within a few minutes had been granted an appointment with Conyers for Thursday .
He postponed it until Tuesday because of the duration of the Mukasey hearing .
Taylor , Saba , and others attended the hearing and were told by Conyers ' staffer Therise
West that they would be removed by force if they did not cover up shirts and pins with messages including " No Torture , " " Arrest Bush , " " Not One More , " and even the text of Article II Section 4 of the U.S. Constitution .
Rather than comply , Taylor and Saba wore shirts displaying that section of the Constitution , were not removed , and were granted the meeting with Conyers to discuss it .
The meeting took place in the rooms attached to the committee room .
After an hour delay , Conyers came in with three beers , a bag of nuts , and two staffers .
Nobody drank the beers .
Conyers ate the nuts .
The staffers were Perry Appelbaum , who left early , and George Slover .
As Taylor recounted it to me , she and Saba pushed Conyers on the importance of the Constitution , on the crisis it faces , and on Congress 's lack of action .
Of course , Conyers wrote a book two years ago called " The Constitution in Crisis , " which details many of Bush and Cheney 's impeachable offenses .
Conyers ' initial reply was along the lines of " Did n't you see the hearing we just had ?
Do you know how many people saw that ? "
To their credit , the two Code Pink women replied " Not very many , since most people do n't get C - Span . "
Conyers said he would keep following up with Mukasey , but Taylor and Saba asked to what end he would do so and advised him to shift his focus to the executive .
Conyers , Taylor said , then began giving reasons why he was afraid of impeachment .
That was n't the word he used , but Taylor understood his concerns to all be expressions of an inchoate fear .
Conyers spoke of " potential ramifications that have n't been examined . "
Interestingly , among his concerns was not the one he has used a lot recently , namely that impeachment would not pass the House .
Instead he was concerned about what might happen after a successful impeachment and removal from office .
Of course , the inconsistency in the excuses Conyers uses could simply be a reflection of the lack of importance he places on the choice of excuse .
The two women argued for the wisdom , bravery , and courage of Congressman Robert Wexler 's proposal to simply begin impeachment hearings on Dick Cheney and see where they go .
The impeachment movement is urging people not only to contact Conyers but also to ask their own representatives to sign onto a letter Wexler has written to Conyers , and to themselves sign Wexler 's petition at http://wexlerwantshearings.com
Conyers said that he knew all about Wexler 's idea and that he was listening to various impeachment advocates .
The two names Taylor remembered him mentioning were mine and Holtzman's .
He 's certainly not listening closely to me , and I would love to meet with him at his convenience .
Holtzman , I know , has wanted to meet with Conyers on this topic for quite some time , but to my knowledge has never been able to do so .
I think the people Conyers is really listening to are too smart for their own good but lacking a bit in the bravery and courage area .
Their wise strategy places the outcome of elections ahead of preserving the democracy in which those elections are held or even the verifiability of those elections .
And , on their own terms , they are probably wrong .
Nothing ( except perhaps hand - counted paper ballots ) would benefit the Democrats in the next election more than a real fight to stand up for justice .
If Congress chooses to cede all power to the White House and move to the back of the bus , Conyers ' legacy will not be what it might have been .

LONDON ( Reuters ) – Presidential candidate John McCain shrugged off criticism from rival Barack Obama over a gaffe about Iraq , saying on Thursday that all politicians slip up and it was time to “ move on ” .
McCain , on a tour of Europe and the Middle East , mistakenly told reporters in Jordan on Tuesday that Iran had backed Sunni militant group al Qaeda in Iraq .
The United States accuses Iran of backing Shi’ite militias there , not Sunnis .
Obama , locked in a battle with New York Sen .
Hillary Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination , pounced on the mistake the following day , suggesting McCain ’s support for the Iraq war stemmed from misreading the situation .
“ We all misspeak from time to time and I immediately corrected it .
Just as Sen. Obama said he was looking forward to meeting the president of Canada , we all misspeak from time to time , ” McCain told reporters in London .

Clinton proposes ' poverty czar ' in speech honoring Martin Luther King Jr. David Edwards
Published : Friday April 4 , 2008
|
Print This Email This Sen. Hillary Clinton proposed creating a cabinet - level " Poverty Czar " during a speech Friday honoring the late civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. " I believe we should appoint a cabinet - level position that will be solely and fully devoted to ending poverty as we know it in America , a position that will focus the attention of our nation on this issue , " she said .
The president would ask the poverty czar , " What have you done today to end poverty in America ? "
The New York Times reports :
She is to make the announcement in her speech at the Mason Temple in Memphis , where officials have gathered to pay tribute to the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King , Jr. in remembrance of the 40th anniversary of his assassination .
The move comes in advance of the North Carolina primary on May 6 , where Mrs. Clinton is hoping to appeal to both black voters and supporters of John Edwards , the former candidate .
Mr. Edwards , a former Senator from North Carolina , had focused his campaign on reducing poverty , which he often called  the cause of my life . 
Both Mrs. Clinton and her rival , Senator Barack Obama , have made pilgrimages to Mr. Edwardss home in North Carolina and sought his endorsement , but so far , Mr. Edwards has remained mum .
He had been critical of both of them while he was still in the race .
Since then , he and his wife , Elizabeth , have suggested that they are more comfortable with Mrs. Clintons health - care plan , which , like the one he proposed first , provides for universal coverage .
The announcement of a poverty czar position could be an open invitation by Mrs. Clinton for Mr. Edwardss backing .
 There is a lot John and I have in common ,  she said in February .
 I will be a fighter , and I intend to ask John Edwards to be a part of anything I do in the White House . 

Transcript via closed captions it is hard to believe that it has been 40 years .
and it is also heartbreaking to know that dr.
king has been gone from this earth longer than he was here .
when one thinks of his life , such a short life , going by in just a moment of time , but having such a profound and lasting impact on all of us .
you know , as a young woman , i was privileged to be taken to hear dr.
king speak by a youth minister who opened my eyes and ears and my horizons .
dr. king 's call to action that evening in chicago led me to confront a world bigger and broader than the one i inhabited .
he had a way of doing that .
of pushing us outside our own comfort zone .
of making it clear that we had to be part of the revolution that was going on .
it was n't a revolution of guns .
it was a revolution of hearts and minds , of attitudes and actions .
when one heard dr. king speak , and i stood in line for a very long time that night , to shake his hand .
and he was gracious and he was kind .
to lean over to shake the hand of a 14 - year - old girl from the suburbs of chicago .
who went to an all - white church and an all - white school and lived in an all - white suburb .
but he did n't ask me , as i reached out my hand , where do you live ?
what 's your experience ?
he just took it .
and looked in my face and thanked me for coming .
that dr. king had such a profound and lasting impact on a young white girl , that he had that kind of impact on millions of people of all colors , faiths , ages and walks of life , tells us something about the reach and power of his vision .
it was a vision big enough and bold enough and grace - filled enough to emsbras every last one of us .
and when he came here to memphis to speak out on behalf of workers , he was n't only speaking for those sanitation workers who were denied their rights , who had seen two of their fellow workers die in a cascade of garbage a few weeks before .
he was speaking out for all workers everywhere who are exploited and abused and denied their basic rights .
when dr. king protested the vietnam war , he was n't just speaking on behalf of black soldiers but all soldiers and civilians .
vietnamese and americans alike .
when he worked on behalf of the poor here in america and around the world , he was n't just speaking for the poor he knew , that he could see with his own eyes .
but the poor who knew no boundaries of geography or color .
and when he stood against discrimination , he was n't just speaking to free african - americans from the shackles of slavery and the past that had been shaped by that abomination .
he was seeking to break the shackles of hatred on the hearts of us all .
he yearned for our country to fulfill the ideals that it had given lip service to .
that were embodied in our founding documents .
in his last speech here , he took us on a tour of his faith .
but he also rooted us in the unfinished business and the unrealized promises of america .
dr. king understood our constitution better than most of us .
and he knew that it was crafted to expand as our hearts expanded .
it was in the a constricted document from one place in time .
but an xansive prok lamation of what america could become if we had the courage to do so .
slavery was written into that document but so was the potential for equality .
he waged that revolution not just to change our laws , but to change our hearts and our behaviors .
he reminded us that those who signed our founding documents were signing a promissory note to which every american was to fall err .
the promise of life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness .
in the end , he asked nothing more than that we redeem that promise .
each in our own way , through faith - based institutions , through our businesses , our labor unions , through our political and public service .
and even though as originally drafted , we did not include dr. king , or me either , women and african - americans were left out of america 's founding promises .
but he never gave up and neither should we .
his faith in america animated and sustained his journey .
like with any faith , there were dark moments when one doubts , when one is on the brink of giving up and throwing in the towel .
but he would always come back from those dark places and so must we .
the tenacity of dr. king 's faith is all the more extraordinary when we think of the ways it was tested .
by all the critics in the media attacking his work .
by the death threats , the bombings , the beatings , the stabbings , the murders , the grinding hard work day after day of just getting up and moving on .
even the speech he gave here at this great complex was n't supposed to be delivered .
the crowd demanded it and he came .
he always answered the call .
and for those who are clergy , you know that it sometimes tests one 's constitution and one 's faith to constantly be asked to do more , to reach out , to keep going .
someone of lesser heart and lesser faith might have grown weary doing good .
might have given up .
but he persisted in the struggle .
and we know the results .
so much has changed .
i look at the young people standing in the back of this room .
and it may be hard for you to imagine what you read in the history books , what your parents and your grandparents tell you .
jim crow is now something you read about .
but people in this room lived under it .
because of dr. king , these young people , my daughter 's generation , grout up taking for granted that children of all colors could attend school together .
because of him , after 219 years and 43 presidents who have been white men , this next generation will grow up taking for granted that a woman or an african - american can be president of the united states of america .
but as far as we 've come , we know the journey is far from over .
some days when you open up the newspaper and you read the headlines , it feels like we 've tumbled right back down that mountain top , does n't it ?
some days it 's amazing how deep the valley can be .
at times like those , i think of what dr. king said in his last speech .
how he acknowledged we are living in a time of turmoil and upheaval .
but then admonished us to remember that only when it is dark enough can you see the stars .
dr. king saw the darkness of a nation torn apart by petty human differences .
but he imagined one knit back together by our shared humanity .
he saw so many going hungry in a land of plenty .
but he envisioned an america where our prosperity was shared .
he saw america embroiled in an endless war .
but imagined a principled peace .
while our problems were grave , he never stopped believing our promise was greater .
he saw us not as we were , but as we could and should be .
is n't it about time we started seeing ourselves as dr. king saw us ?
is n't it about time we came together as we have in memphis , to find the solutions to make america what it can and should be ?
when i say solutions , i mean good jobs .
jobs you can raise a family on .
jobs that give people a shot at the middle class .
to be able to stay there and live with dignity and respect .

NEW : 300 Whisper Forums !
After considerable frustration on my part , I have finally managed to get a new forum up and running .
The forum includes two areas , one for area for 300 Whisper rifles and pistols and a second for reloading and ammo issues .
I have a huge number of visitors that come to these pages each day so please drop in the forum and say " Hi " and share your projects !
Click HERE to go to SSK Industries Click HERE to go to SSK Industries The 300 Whisper® is a new concept in the development of small case capacity , highly efficient cartridges combined with bullets of extreme ballistic efficiency .
The 300 Whisper® was designed for the purpose of firing extremely heavy , accurate , ballistically efficient bullets at sub-sonic velocities and is now the state of the art long range cartridge in suppressed weapons .
It delivers more energy more accurately than any existing sub-sonic round at 200 yards {and a lot further} ( except other Whispers® ) .
In addition , it has interesting sonic capabilities - possessing greater versatility than any other cartridge capable of performing in these vastly differing arenas .
Powder charges are very small allowing the use of small suppressors .
The 240 grain Sierra Matchking launched at a muzzle velocity of 1040 FPS / 576 foot pounds energy arrives at 200 yards with a velocity of 976 FPS / 508 FPE while maintaining minute of angle accuracy from bolt action rifles and many autos .
Suppressed , most of the " noise " heard by the firer is that of the firing pin striking and action " tightening up " under the stress generated .
With suppressors there is some small amount of muzzle noise .
In this mode there is no audible sound made by the bullet as it is under the speed of sound and does not generate a sonic boom .
Unsuppressed , with heavy bullets , the sound of firing is less than that of a 9 MM pistol .
Sub-sonic as well as sonic accuracy is maintained with bullets weighing 125 , 150 , 168 , 180 , 190 , 200 , 220 and 240 grains from the same barrel .
200 , 220 and 240 - grain sub-sonic bullets usually tumble shortly after impact creating wounds far in excess of their " paper " ballistics .
Special purpose projectile ammunition is also available on special request .
A " helmet puncher " is now under development .
" Upper " receivers for the AR - 15 / M - 16 made by SSK utilize 100 % AR - 15 / M - 16 parts with the exception of the 30 - caliber barrel and gas system .
The gas system may be a fixed system which operates the weapon normally or an adjustable four position system which incorporates a cut off for very silent operation in the suppressed sub -sonic mode , a port which develops a rate of fire in full auto of about 750 RPM , another for operation under dirty conditions to assure reliability and another special purpose port .
Pulling the pins and replacing the original " upper " unit with the SSK Whisper® unit converts the AR - 15 / M - 16 to 30 caliber .
Standard M - 16 magazines are used .
Accuracy , power and control of the weapon in full auto sub-sonic mode is simply unmatched by any other weapon of this type .
In sub -sonic sub - machine gun mode , it far exceeds any other similar purpose sub- machine gun cartridge and weapon system .
Subsonic Loads Velocity / Energy ( Yards ) 125 168 220 240 0 1040/300 1040/403

In addition to its sub-sonic role , the 300 Whisper® has the ability to perform several sonic velocity roles .
Ammunition utilizing 125 grain Ballistic Tip Bullets at 2400 FPS / 1598 FPE and all other weights through 240 grain bullets at 1375 FPS / 1005 FPE operates through all of the guns without the need for modification .
Supersonic ammunition will create a ballistic " crack " even with a suppressed weapon .
However the ' " crack " of the bullet is non directional - you can't tell the origin of the shot .
Shorty , Standard and Match Grade AR - 15 / M-16 units are available .
Stainless match grade barrels are our " standard " for suppressed use .
SSK suppressers are also of stainless construction .
The Thompson Center Contender in both pistol and carbine versions are naturals for this caliber and are inexpensive .
Most guns originally chambered for the 223 ( 5.56 MM ) round can be converted to the 300 Whisper® .
The lnterarms Mini -Mark X and Sako actions make up into particularly nice small rifles suitable for both the counter sniper role and for hunting .
In super - sonic mode , the 300 Whisper® essentially ballistically duplicates the 7.62 .
x 39 Russian round with far better and more accurate bullets than usually found in the Russians .310-.311 bullet diameter .
It makes an excellent 200 - 250 yard deer cartridge in very lightweight rifles with very little recoil making it an excellent choice for any individual who may be sensitive to recoil .
As a recreational cartridge it is accurate , has a low noise level in any mode , and with the heavier bullets is capable of 100 % performance on Silhouette Ram targets .
The 300 Whisper® utilizes the 221 Fireball case opened to 30 caliber as its parent cartridge .
SSK is currently accepting orders for bolt action rifles in several varieties , AR - 15 / M - 16 complete guns or upper units , Contender barrels or complete guns .
Reloading dies are in stock .
Sound suppressors in a variety of configurations are available .
J. D. Jones is the inventor of the 300 Whisper® .
There are other Whisper® cartridges at every caliber step from 22 through 50 .
Data on them will be released as is found appropriate .
Serious inquiries regarding the 500 Whisper® ( sub - sonic 750/1040 FPS or sonic 750 / 2000 FPS ) from a lightweight repeating rifle will be answered on an individual basis .
COR - BON is producing loaded ammunition in a variety of weights and velocities ranging from 125/2400 through the 240/1040 velocity range .
Ammunition is available from SSK .
SIGHTS : Any iron , optical or electronic sight seems to work well .
Personally , I prefer modified Leupold scopes with multiple dots for each 50 - yard increment from 50 through 300 yards for subsonic usage .
Handloading the 300 Whisper® : Unfired 221 Fireball cases are first neck expanded to 30 caliber ; then full length resized in the 300 Whisper® die which corrects any neck misalignment due to neck expanding .
Case mouths should be chamfered although this is considered a superfluous optional procedure by some .
Normal priming with small rifle primers , ( I prefer the Remington 7 - 1/2 ) charging with powder and normal seating of the bullet completes the procedure .
There are no surprises in loading the 300 Whisper® .
However , you should note normal lot to lot variations in components can and do make substantial differences when loading sub-sonic ammunition .
The speed of sound here at the shop usually is around 1100 FPS .
I 've seen it as high as about 1115 and as low as about 1060 or 1070 FPS .
Normal shot to shot variations can change velocities substantially .
Leaving a loaded round in a hot chamber can easily transform a sub-sonic round to sonic .
In many loads , each one tenth of a grain of powder can change the velocity 30 - 40 FPS which is normally not a big deal .
If you want to load very uniform ammunition to just below the speed of sound , I strongly suggest an electronic powder measure and the weighing of 10 charges to obtain your average actual charge weight .
Many powder measures are not very accurate with these small charges .
We can furnish extremely accurate measures at minimal cost .
All of the above hand loading factors applying to all small cartridge case ammunition and are really nothing new .
The range of powders useful in the 300 Whisper® is very wide , ranging in burning speed from Accurate Arms # 2 through 11 -322 .
In general , powder in the burning range of AA # 9 , H-i 10 , WW 296 , AA 1680 give excellent accuracy and velocities with practically all bullet weights and velocity ranges .
In subsonic loads powders that burn faster than AA # 9 should not be used in AR - 15s .
The 300 Whisper® -VS - OVER-VS - UNDER penetration : Particularly in the urban role the 7.62 x 51( 308 ) has given excessive penetration in numerous instances where a 300 Whisper® would have accomplished the job silently , effortlessly and without endangering the lives of others by use of a needlessly powerful weapon .
The 5.56 x 45 ( 223 ) has given over penetration in some buildings while falling on glass , automobiles and other objects with the same ammunition .
The 300 Whisper® addresses many of these problems successfully .
Those with extensive experience in attempting to penetrate automobile bodies will recognize almost anything short of a 50 BMG will have the occasional failure to get through some automobile on some shots .
NEW DEVELOPMENTS
A 300 and 338 Whisper® sub -machine gun has been developed which renders obsolete any " pistol " caliber sub -gun .
Accuracy and control are simply unmatched by any other subgun .
A pistol has also been developed .
Both can be suppressed .
The 6.5 Whisper® ( 85 through 160 grain bullets ) and the 7MM Whisper® ( 100 through 185 - grain bullets ) are ready for sale .
Both work in AR - 15 / M - 16 as well as other type guns .
The 338 Whisper® ( 175-300 grain bullets ) is extremely accurate and may be had in Contenders or " 308 " bolt action rifles can be converted to it .
A switch barrel 338 Whisper® .308/7/08 can also be had .
The 458 Whisper® uses all normal 458 bullets plus 560 and 600 - grain low - drag bullets for tremendous downrange performance .
The 500 Whisper® is simply the most powerful subsonic round in existence .
Both of these can be had in bolt actions or Ruger # 1 rifles .
Numerous other very accurate sub-sonic rounds utilizing heavy ballistically efficient bullets have been developed .
Those with special needs are invited to inquire .
SSK also makes a wide array of custom rifles , handguns and suppressors ranging from 22 rimfire through 50 caliber which provide unequaled accuracy in subsonic usage .

Donald Knuth : “ I trust my family jewels only to Linux ”
Andrew Binstock interviewed Donald Knuth recently , and one of the more amusing tidbits was this :
I currently use Ubuntu Linux , on a standalone laptop — it has no Internet connection .
I occasionally carry flash memory drives between this machine and the Macs that I use for network surfing and graphics ; but I trust my family jewels only to Linux .
More seriously , I found his comments about about multi-core computers to be very interesting :
I might as well flame a bit about my personal unhappiness with the current trend toward multicore architecture .
To me , it looks more or less like the hardware designers have run out of ideas , and that they ’re trying to pass the blame for the future demise of Moore ’s Law to the software writers by giving us machines that work faster only on a few key benchmarks !
I wo n’t be surprised at all if the whole multithreading idea turns out to be a flop , worse than the “ Itanium ” approach that was supposed to be so terrific — until it turned out that the wished - for compilers were basically impossible to write .
Let me put it this way :
During the past 50 years , I ’ve written well over a thousand programs , many of which have substantial size .
I ca n’t think of even five of those programs that would have been enhanced noticeably by parallelism or multithreading .
Surely , for example , multiple processors are no help to TeX … .
I know that important applications for parallelism exist — rendering graphics , breaking codes , scanning images , simulating physical and biological processes , etc .
But all these applications require dedicated code and special - purpose techniques , which will need to be changed substantially every few years .
This is a very interesting issue , because it raises the question of what next - generation CPU ’s need to do in order to be successful .
Given that it is no longer possible to just double the clock frequency every 18 months , should CPU architects just start doubling the number of cores every 18 months instead ?
Or should they try to concentrate a lot more computing power into an individual core , and optimize for a fast and dense interconnect between the CPU’s ?
The latter is much more difficult , and the advantage of doing the first is that it ’s really easy for marketing types to use some cheesy benchmark such as SPECint to help sell the chip , but then people find out that it ’s not very useful in real life .
Why ?
Because programmers have proven that they have a huge amount of trouble writing programs that take advantage of these very large multicore computers .
Ultimately , I suspect that we will need a radically different way of programming in order to take advantage of these systems , and perhaps a totally new programming language before we will be able to use them .
Professor Knuth is highly dubious that the later approach will work , and while I hope he ’s wrong ( since I suspect the hardware designers are starting to run out of ideas , so it ’s time software engineers started doing some innovating ) , he ’s a pretty smart guy , and he may well be right .
Of course , another question is whether what would we do with all of that computing power ?
Whatever happened to the predictions that computers would be able to support voice or visual recognition ?
And of course , what about the power and cooling issues for these super - high - powered chips ?
All I can say is , the next couple of years is going to be interesting , as we try to sort out all of these issues .
You drive a beat up ’95 Honda Civic and your spouse drives a shiny new BMW .
You go to the mall and buy what you intended to buy , but your spouse comes home with a few of the latest gadgets and a new pair of shoes .
You are working hard to save your pennies , but your spouse is spending cash as if it grew on trees .
Does this sound familiar to you ?
Do you have an overspending spouse ?
So how do you deal with a spouse who seems to blow money at the slightest whim ?
Be as gentle and as loving as possible , but assertive in your mission .
Here are steps you can take to deal with an overspending spouse and improve your situation .
Pro tip :
Are you and your spouse struggling with debt due to overspending ?
Companies like Freedom Debt Relief can help you eliminate debt for good .
They ’ll customize a plan for you and negotiate with your creditors .
When it ’s all done , you ’ll be debt - free and on a better path to financial happiness .
How to Deal with an Overspending Spouse
Changing your spouse ’s spending habits may seem like jumping a giant hurdle , so it is best to take the process in baby steps .
Follow the procedure below in order to minimize the stress of taking on this large and often intimidating task .
1. Approach Your Spouse Lovingly
Do not begin by accusing your spouse of wrongdoing or by pointing out faults .
Deserved or not , this sort of treatment will only drive a wedge between the two of you and make it harder to communicate .
Instead , approach the subject in a loving manner .
For example , explain that you want to start monitoring spending habits as a couple , and then start a discussion from there .
Another tactic is to discuss ways to save up for something really important like retirement .
Drive home the point that you are a team in your financial efforts .
Otherwise , your spouse may resort to lying about spending money to you .
2. Set Up a Budget
If you have yet to make a budget , take this opportunity to set one up together .
Sign up for an account with Personal Capital .
The tools they have will make it really simple to start having productive conversations about where the money is being spent .
If you do have one , this may be a good time to revisit it and possibly revise it .
Work together with your overspending spouse to figure out what your total income is and what all of your expenses are .
If you can show your spouse that money spent on frivolous items is causing you to go into debt or preventing you from saving , you are on the right track .
However , it ’s ideal if through the creation ( or revision ) of your budget , your spouse can come to this conclusion without you having to point it out .
3. Decide on How to Control Spending
If you were able to get your spouse to see the error of his or her ways , that was at least half of the battle .
Now , you need to help control the spending .
One way to do this is by allowing the both of you to only spend a certain amount of money each pay period .
I recommend using the envelope budgeting system because it utilizes cash to hold you accountable to staying on budget .
Once you have spent your cash , you are out of money .
4. Set Realistic Goals
Once you have talked to your spouse , set up a budget , and decided on a method for controlling spending , it ’s time to look at your long - term financial goals .
You both need a reason for sticking to your budget and need something to work towards .
Do you need to get out of debt ?
Make that your first goal .
Do you need to save up an emergency fund or start working towards saving for retirement ?
Those are also very important goals .
Tip :
While you create financial goals , it ’s also a good idea to make goals to strengthen your marriage , such as planning frequent date nights .
5. Hold Regular Financial Meetings
Reaching your goals will be an ongoing process , and if your spouse has a habit of overspending , it may take some time to break .
Hold regular financial meetings to monitor and discuss your progress .
You may find that some months you regress , but most likely , you will see an emerging trend of improving finances .
Use this information and the meeting time as a chance to praise your spouse and encourage each other to keep working towards your collective goals .
What If You Need More Help ?
If you have gone through the steps above and have n’t seen much improvement , do n’t lose hope .
You and your spouse may need to take extra steps or get more help .
Here are five things to try first :
1. Cut Up Your Credit Cards
If you tried the envelope system for budgeting , but kept your credit cards just in case , the power of plastic may be too much to resist for compulsive shopaholics .
If you suspect this is the case , then get rid of them .
Spending money can be addictive , especially if you can’t actually see the money leaving your hands .
Cut up the credit cards , and if you must , close the accounts to take the temptation out of the picture altogether .
2. Use a Piggy Bank
Did you make a piggy bank when you were little ?
Well , I still have one and I use it to this day .
I regularly deposit change in my piggy bank and after a while , I am rewarded for my efforts .
It ’s a great way to practice patience and discipline , which may be exactly what your spouse needs to lose the overspending habit .
Do n’t use the piggy bank method alone , however .
Do it in conjunction with cutting up the credit cards and the process described above .
Reinforce to your spouse that this is not a punishment , but a way of rewarding hard work and self - control .
3. Motivational Reading
Like many people , I get really fired up and excited after reading a book .
If your spouse is this way too , try picking up some inspirational reading like Dave Ramsey ’s The Total Money Makeover or Thomas Stanley ’s The Millionaire Next Door for starters .
Once you ’ve read these , there are other great personal finance books out there as well .
Reading about how others managed their spending can inspire both of you to work towards the changes you need to make .
4. Seek Counseling
If all else fails , or perhaps you are feeling resistance from your spouse , you may need to seek help from an outside source .
Counseling can uncover deeper issues that your spouse is trying to cope with by overspending .
Consider joint sessions , at least to begin with , to make sure your spouse ’s overspending is n’t a response to underlying dynamics in your marriage .
5. Get Support
Organizations like Debtors Anonymous ( DA ) , can give you and your spouse the tools you need to handle your situation effectively .
Debtors Anonymous offers a 12 - step program to control overspending and provides support from others who have been in the same place you ’re in now .
Final Word
These suggestions will only work if you do not overspend yourself .
Make sure you set a good example and that you are working towards financial goals just as hard as you expect your spouse to .
Most importantly , support your spouse through the process and only use loving words so that the issue does n’t drive a wedge in your relationship .
Change and healing are most likely to occur if you demonstrate that you are in this together .
Are you in the process of dealing with an overspending spouse ?
What are some of the issues and biggest challenges that you needed to work through ?
Olbermann : Bush push for telco immunity ' textbook example of fascism ' David Edwards and Nick Juliano
Published : Friday February 1 , 2008

In a blistering condemnation of President Bush 's willingness to go to the wall for corporations he relies on to spy on Americans , MSNBC host Keith Olbermann says the president 's message in his State of the Union address calling for immunity of telecommunications companies is a " textbook example of fascism . "
Bush and Congressional Democrats are in a pitched fight over whether to free telecoms from legal liability as part of an overhaul of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act .
The president says the companies should be rewarded for their cooperation in the war on terror ; critics say legal immunity would preclude any oversight of Bush 's warrantless wiretapping program that ensnared US citizens .
Olbermann accused Bush 's threat to veto any bill without immunity of aiding the terrorists , when coupled with his threat that failing to act on a permanent FISA expansion would weaken US national security .
" You told Congress , if you do not act by Friday , our ability to track terrorist threats would be weakened , and our citizens would be in greater danger , " Olbermann said .
" Yet you you are willing to weaken that ability .
You will subject us , your citizens , to that greater danger .
This is simple enough for you to understand .
If Congress approves a new FISA act without telecom immunity , and sends it to your desk , and you veto it , you , by your own terms and your own definitions , you will have just sided with the terrorists . "
The host further excoriated Bush for refusing to even acknowledge corporate assistance , always couching his calls for immunity by describing companies " believed " or " alleged " to have assisted his still - classified program .
" If you , sir , are asking Congress and us to join you in this shameless , breathless , literal textbook example of fascism , the merged efforts of government and corporations who answer to no government , you still do n't have the guts to say the telecom companies did assist you in your efforts ? "
Olbermann asked .
" Will you and the equivocators who surround you like a cocoon never go on the record about anything ?
Even the stuff you claim to believe in ? "
Ironically , Olbermann notes , that Vice President Dick Cheney did go on the record about telecom involvement , when he spoke to conservative talker Rush Limbaugh Wednesday .
" The Vice President probably shouldnt have phoned in to the Rush Limbaugh Propaganda - Festival yesterday .
Sixth sentence out of Mr. Cheney s mouth :
The FISA bill is about , quote , ' retroactive liability protection for the companies that have worked with us and helped us prevent further attacks against the United States , ' " Olbermann said .
" Oops . Mr. Cheney is something of a loose cannon , of course .
But he kind of let the wrong cat out of the bag there . "
Some critics dismissed Olbermann as a hyberbolic ranter who relies on over - the - top rhetoric .
" The MSNBC host , who once scolded public figures who use Nazi references , made his own latest invocation of Nazi Germany , as he compared the telecoms to the Krupp family who were convicted of war crimes at Nuremberg , " wrote conservative media critic Brad Wilmouth .
" Olbermann : ' It begins to look like the bureaucrats of the Third Reich trying to protect the Krupp family industrial giants by literally rewriting the laws of Germany for their benefit .
And we know how that turned out .
Alfred Krupp and 11 of his directors were convicted of war crimes at Nuremburg . ' "
Unable to reach a final agreement on how to update FISA and whether to give immunity to the telecoms , Congress this week passed a 15 - day extension to the Protect America Act , a temporary FISA extension forced through Congress just before its August recess .
On Monday , the Senate will resume debate on the FISA expansion , after Republicans backed off their demands that all proposed amendments be subjected to a 60 - vote majority , according to Congressional Quarterly .
The subscription - only Capitol Hill journal reports :
Three amendments to be voted on next week will address retroactive immunity for companies being sued for allegedly assisting the National Security Agency in its warrantless surveillance program .
One , by Democrats Russ Feingold of Wisconsin and Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut , would simply remove the immunity provisions , which are a priority for the Bush administration .
Another , by Arlen Specter , R - Pa. , and Sheldon Whitehouse , D - R.I. , would substitute the federal government as the defendant in the lawsuits .
Both would only need a simple majority for adoption .
A third , by Dianne Feinstein , D - Calif. , would require the companies to justify their actions before the secret FISA court , which would then decide whether immunity was warranted .
It would require 60 votes to be adopted .
Some critics see the move as just another GOP gambit to block immunity from passing .
" It seems rather clear what happened here .
There are certain amendments that are not going to get even 50 votes -- including the Dodd / Feingold amendment to strip telecom immunity out of the bill -- and , for that reason , Republicans were more than willing to agree to a 50 - vote threshold , since they know those amendments wo n't pass even in a simple up - or - down vote , " writes Glenn Greenwald , a prominent blogger covering the FISA fight .
" But then , there are other amendments which might be able to get 50 votes , but can not get 60 votes -- such as Feinstein 's amendment to transfer the telecom cases to the FISA court and her other amendment providing that FISA is the " exclusive means " for eavesdropping -- and , thus , those are the amendments for which the GOP insisted upon a 60 - vote requirement .

During his comment , Olbermann reiterated the revelation from former AT&T technician Mark Klein , who blew the whistle on his former company 's collusion with the National Security Agency , that he connected a " Big Brother machine " to funnel every piece of communication crossing AT&T 's wires into an NSA database .
" This is n't about finding that kind of needle in a haystack , this is n't even about finding that haystack " Olbermann said .
" This is about scooping up every piece of hay there ever was . "

I find it ironic that so many conservatives who deplore extended dependence on government welfare ( because it destroys the soul ) embrace non-ending handouts “ from heaven . ”
In his 2005 article in The National Review , “ Welfare Reform Part II , ” Stephen Moore wrote that it was time to start chopping welfare programs again .
Moore was not content with the cuts made as part of the 1996 Welfare Reform .
It was time to make deeper cuts .
In Moore ’s opinion , there are deep psychological reasons for kicking people off welfare .
These have to do with the alleged fact that extended receipt of welfare assistance destroys human capacity for self initiative .
Here are Moore ’s own words :
Welfare Reform Part II , if properly implemented , will save money and for those in need restore the dignity of a purposeful life .
It will also be consistent with the original intention of aid to the poor , which was to be a temporary safety net for those out of work and out of luck .
Back in 1935 the founder of the modern welfare state warned : “ Continued dependence upon relief induces a spiritual and moral disintegration fundamentally destructive to the national fiber .
To dole out relief in this way is to administer a narcotic , a subtle destroyer of the human spirit . ”
The speaker was Franklin Roosevelt .
What a tragedy that seven decades later Uncle Sam is still undermining the human spirit with this destructive narcotic .
Moore ’s article reminded me of the relationship that many Christians claim to have with their God .
You can constantly hear it in their prayers .
They ask for new cars , houses , spouses and better jobs .
They do n’t stop at material things .
They ask for their God to give them courage , patience , wisdom and fortitude .
See here and here , for example .
The prayers often take the following tone ( warning : this is my own semi-cynical paraphrasing ) :
Oh God , I am nothing .
Please take pity on me and give me A , B and C .
And tomorrow , please give me D , E and F . I want you to do my thinking for me .
Please keep telling me what to do so that I do n’t have to do any of that work .
Give me strength , mercy , wisdom , patience .
Give me give me give me .
Someday .
please let me into heaven and let me sit on your lap and let me be forever dependent on the things that you will give to me up there .
In short , for many people , God has assumed the role of the Welfare State .
It ’s a one - way street , where those who pray repeatedly ask their God to satisfy their own needs and wants .
To the extent that Stephen Moore is correct in his analysis of welfare dependence , conservative Christians should be wary of the effect of their own conceptualization of God .
How about this as an alternative , a healthier approach to God ?
Assume that you were given a great gift by being allowed to be born .
This initial gift gave you “ dignity of a purposeful life . ”
Assume that God ’s gift of life to you was a “ temporary safety net , ” but it is now time for you to stop asking for help .
It is time for you to pick yourself up and fend for yourself materially , intellectually and emotionally .
It is time for you to wean yourself of God -The - Welfare - Administrator .
To do otherwise is to become dependent upon your God as “ a narcotic , a subtle destroyer of the human spirit . ”

ISLAMABAD ( Reuters ) - Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf issued a warning to opposition parties to accept the result of Monday ’s election and not resort to agitation if it goes against them , while guaranteeing it will be free and fair .

Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf issued a warning to opposition parties to accept the result of Monday 's election and not resort to agitation if it goes against them , while guaranteeing it will be free and fair .

“ They should not be under any illusion that they will bring people to the streets after the election .
Nothing of that sort will be allowed , ” Musharraf said in comments at a seminar telecast on Thursday by state - run Pakistan Television .
“ In this situation of extremism and terrorism , no agitation , anarchy or chaos can be acceptable . ”
Musharraf , who came to power as a general in a 1999 coup , quit as army chief in November after securing a second five - year term in circumstances his foes describe as unconstitutional .
Monday ’s vote is for a new National Assembly and provincial assemblies , and a hostile new parliament could seek his ouster .
Opposition parties have accused the government of trying to rig the polls to favor Musharraf ’s allies and have threatened to launch protests if they feel cheated .
“ Do n’t show arrogance , if you win , and show grace , if you lose , accept the results , ” Musharraf said , rejecting the opposition ’s allegations .
“ I am conscious of the fact that the elections should be free , fair and transparent and they have to be seen free , fair and transparent and also peaceful .
The entire world is watching us , ” he said .
“ I guarantee that these will be free and fair . ”
He said there could be lower - level tactical irregularities by candidates but the government would not be involved .
VIOLENCE
The United States and Pakistan ’s other Western allies fear instability in nuclear - armed Pakistan could play into the hands of militants linked to al Qaeda and the Taliban .
However , U.S. State Department spokesman Sean McCormack told reporters that “ people have the right to peacefully protest and to peacefully speak ... their opinions , regardless of whether those opinions are supportive of a government and its policies or not . ”
Violence has intensified in the country in the run-up to the vote that was delayed from January 8 after the assassination of opposition leader and former prime minister Benazir Bhutto .
Her Pakistan People ’s Party ( PPP ) , led by her widower Asif Ali Zardari , is expected to emerge as the largest party in the 342 - seat National Assembly partly due to sympathy .
Earlier this week Zardari met with Nawaz Sharif , the prime minister Musharraf overthrew , to discuss how to fight for democracy .
Zardari said the PPP would go to “ any extent ” to protest a rigged election , without elaborating .
Protected by bullet - proof glass Zardari told supporters in Faisalabad that Pakistan had been turned into “ a hell ” during the past eight years .

“ On February 18 , you will have to choose between those who have broken Pakistan or those who can save it , ” he told a crowd of around 6,000 in the industrial city in central Punjab province .
U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice on Wednesday said she was concerned about election violence in Pakistan .
At least 24 people have been killed and more than 30 wounded in bomb attacks on political workers in the last week alone .
Paramilitary troops , who stepped up patrols in the election run-up , said they had confiscated a haul of weapons parts including rifle scopes and rocket launcher sights during a check on southern Sindh province ’s main highway on Monday , and arrested a man from Swat , a militant - troubled region in the northwest .
Musharraf described Monday ’s vote as “ mother of all elections ” and urged international opinion poll firms not to “ incite trouble ” by pre-judging results .
A BBC World Service / Gallup Pakistan poll , conducted in late January , found that almost two - thirds of Pakistanis say the prompt resignation of Musharraf would improve security , while less than a third view his November re-election as valid .

The first law of thermodynamics , better known as Conservation of Energy , says that you can't create energy from nothing : it prohibits perpetual motion machines of the first type , which run and run indefinitely without consuming fuel or any other resource .
According to our modern view of physics , energy is conserved in each individual interaction of particles .
By mathematical induction , we see that no matter how large an assemblage of particles may be , it cannot produce energy from nothing - not without violating what we presently believe to be the laws of physics .
This is why the US Patent Office will summarily reject your amazingly clever proposal for an assemblage of wheels and gears that cause one spring to wind up another as the first runs down , and so continue to do work forever , according to your calculations .
There 's a fully general proof that at least one wheel must violate ( our standard model of ) the laws of physics for this to happen .
So unless you can explain how one wheel violates the laws of physics , the assembly of wheels can't do it either .
A similar argument applies to a " reactionless drive " , a propulsion system that violates Conservation of Momentum .
In standard physics , momentum is conserved for all individual particles and their interactions ; by mathematical induction , momentum is conserved for physical systems whatever their size .
If you can visualize two particles knocking into each other and always coming out with the same total momentum that they started with , then you can see how scaling it up from particles to a gigantic complicated collection of gears wo n't change anything .
Even if there 's a trillion quadrillion atoms involved , 0 + 0 + ... + 0 = 0 .
But Conservation of Energy , as such , cannot prohibit converting heat into work .
You can , in fact , build a sealed box that converts ice cubes and stored electricity into warm water .
It is n't even difficult .
Energy cannot be created or destroyed :
The net change in energy , from transforming ( ice cubes + electricity ) to ( warm water ) , must be 0 .
So it could n't violate Conservation of Energy , as such , if you did it the other way around ...
Perpetual motion machines of the second type , which convert warm water into electrical current and ice cubes , are prohibited by the Second Law of Thermodynamics .
The Second Law is a bit harder to understand , as it is essentially Bayesian in nature .
Yes , really .
The essential physical law underlying the Second Law of Thermodynamics is a theorem which can be proven within the standard model of physics :
In the development over time of any closed system , phase space volume is conserved .
Let 's say you 're holding a ball high above the ground .
We can describe this state of affairs as a point in a multidimensional space , at least one of whose dimensions is " height of ball above the ground " .
Then , when you drop the ball , it moves , and so does the dimensionless point in phase space that describes the entire system that includes you and the ball .
" Phase space " , in physics - speak , means that there are dimensions for the momentum of the particles , not just their position - i.e. , a system of 2 particles would have 12 dimensions , 3 dimensions for each particle 's position , and 3 dimensions for each particle 's momentum .
If you had a multidimensional space , each of whose dimensions described the position of a gear in a huge assemblage of gears , then as you turned the gears a single point would swoop and dart around in a rather high - dimensional phase space .
Which is to say , just as you can view a great big complex machine as a single point in a very - high - dimensional space , so too , you can view the laws of physics describing the behavior of this machine over time , as describing the trajectory of its point through the phase space .
The Second Law of Thermodynamics is a consequence of a theorem which can be proven in the standard model of physics :
If you take a volume of phase space , and develop it forward in time using standard physics , the total volume of the phase space is conserved .
For example :
Let there be two systems , X and Y : where X has 8 possible states , Y has 4 possible states , and the joint system ( X , Y ) has 32 possible states .
The development of the joint system over time can be described as a rule that maps initial points onto future points .
For example , the system could start out in X 7 Y 2 , then develop ( under some set of physical laws ) into the state X 3 Y 3 a minute later .
Which is to say : if X started in 7 , and Y started in 2 , and we watched it for 1 minute , we would see X go to 3 and Y go to 3 .
Such are the laws of physics .
Next , let 's carve out a subspace S of the joint system state .
S will be the subspace bounded by X being in state 1 and Y being in states 1 - 4 .
So the total volume of S is 4 states .
And let 's suppose that , under the laws of physics governing ( X , Y ) the states initially in S behave as follows :
X 1 Y 1 -> X 2 Y 1
X 1 Y 2 -> X 4 Y 1
X 1 Y 3 -> X 6 Y 1
X 1 Y 4 -> X 8 Y 1
That , in a nutshell , is how a refrigerator works .
The X subsystem began in a narrow region of state space - the single state 1 , in fact - and Y began distributed over a wider region of space , states 1 - 4 .
By interacting with each other , Y went into a narrow region , and X ended up in a wide region ; but the total phase space volume was conserved .
4 initial states mapped to 4 end states .
Clearly , so long as total phase space volume is conserved by physics over time , you can't squeeze Y harder than X expands , or vice versa - for every subsystem you squeeze into a narrower region of state space , some other subsystem has to expand into a wider region of state space .
Now let 's say that we 're uncertain about the joint system ( X , Y ) , and our uncertainty is described by an equiprobable distribution over S .
That is , we 're pretty sure X is in state 1 , but Y is equally likely to be in any of states 1 - 4 .
If we shut our eyes for a minute and then open them again , we will expect to see Y in state 1 , but X might be in any of states 2 - 8 .
Actually , X can only be in some of states 2 - 8 , but it would be too costly to think out exactly which states these might be , so we 'll just say 2 - 8 .
If you consider the Shannon entropy of our uncertainty about X and Y as individual systems , X began with 0 bits of entropy because it had a single definite state , and Y began with 2 bits of entropy because it was equally likely to be in any of 4 possible states .
( There 's no mutual information between X and Y. )
A bit of physics occurred , and lo , the entropy of Y went to 0 , but the entropy of X went to log 2 ( 7 ) = 2.8 bits .
So entropy was transferred from one system to another , and decreased within the Y subsystem ; but due to the cost of bookkeeping , we did n't bother to track some information , and hence ( from our perspective ) the overall entropy increased .
If there was a physical process that mapped past states onto future states like this :
X2,Y1 -> X2,Y1
X2,Y2 -> X2,Y1
X2,Y3 -> X2,Y1
X2,Y4 -> X2,Y1
Then you could have a physical process that would actually decrease entropy , because no matter where you started out , you would end up at the same place .
The laws of physics , developing over time , would compress the phase space .
But there is a theorem , Liouville 's Theorem , which can be proven true of our laws of physics , which says that this never happens : phase space is conserved .
The Second Law of Thermodynamics is a corollary of Liouville 's Theorem : no matter how clever your configuration of wheels and gears , you 'll never be able to decrease entropy in one subsystem without increasing it somewhere else .
When the phase space of one subsystem narrows , the phase space of another subsystem must widen , and the joint space keeps the same volume .
Except that what was initially a compact phase space , may develop squiggles and wiggles and convolutions ; so that to draw a simple boundary around the whole mess , you must draw a much larger boundary than before - this is what gives the appearance of entropy increasing .
( And in quantum systems , where different universes go different ways , entropy actually does increase in any local universe .
But omit this complication for now . )
The Second Law of Thermodynamics is actually probabilistic in nature - if you ask about the probability of hot water spontaneously entering the " cold water and electricity " state , the probability does exist , it 's just very small .
This does n't mean Liouville 's Theorem is violated with small probability ; a theorem 's a theorem , after all .
It means that if you 're in a great big phase space volume at the start , but you do n't know where , you may assess a tiny little probability of ending up in some particular phase space volume .
So far as you know , with infinitesimal probability , this particular glass of hot water may be the kind that spontaneously transforms itself to electrical current and ice cubes .
( Neglecting , as usual , quantum effects . )
So the Second Law really is inherently Bayesian .
When it comes to any real thermodynamic system , it 's a strictly lawful statement of your beliefs about the system , but only a probabilistic statement about the system itself .
" Hold on , " you say .
" That 's not what I learned in physics class , " you say .
" In the lectures I heard , thermodynamics is about , you know , temperatures .
Uncertainty is a subjective state of mind !
The temperature of a glass of water is an objective property of the water !
What does heat have to do with probability ? "
Oh ye of little trust .
In one direction , the connection between heat and probability is relatively straightforward :
If the only fact you know about a glass of water is its temperature , then you are much more uncertain about a hot glass of water than a cold glass of water .
Heat is the zipping around of lots of tiny molecules ; the hotter they are , the faster they can go .
Not all the molecules in hot water are travelling at the same speed - the " temperature " is n't a uniform speed of all the molecules , it 's an average speed of the molecules , which in turn corresponds to a predictable statistical distribution of speeds - anyway , the point is that , the hotter the water , the faster the water molecules could be going , and hence , the more uncertain you are about the velocity ( not just speed ) of any individual molecule .
When you multiply together your uncertainties about all the individual molecules , you will be exponentially more uncertain about the whole glass of water .
We take the logarithm of this exponential volume of uncertainty , and call that the entropy .
So it all works out , you see .
The connection in the other direction is less obvious .
Suppose there was a glass of water , about which , initially , you knew only that its temperature was 72 degrees .
Then , suddenly , Saint Laplace reveals to you the exact locations and velocities of all the atoms in the water .
You now know perfectly the state of the water , so , by the information - theoretic definition of entropy , its entropy is zero .
Does that make its thermodynamic entropy zero ?
Is the water colder , because we know more about it ?
Ignoring quantumness for the moment , the answer is : Yes !
Yes it is !
Maxwell once asked :
Why can't we take a uniformly hot gas , and partition it into two volumes A and B , and let only fast - moving molecules pass from B to A , while only slow - moving molecules are allowed to pass from A to B ?
If you could build a gate like this , soon you would have hot gas on the A side , and cold gas on the B side .
That would be a cheap way to refrigerate food , right ?
The agent who inspects each gas molecule , and decides whether to let it through , is known as " Maxwell 's Demon " .
And the reason you can't build an efficient refrigerator this way , is that Maxwell 's Demon generates entropy in the process of inspecting the gas molecules and deciding which ones to let through .
But suppose you already knew where all the gas molecules were ?
Then you actually could run Maxwell 's Demon and extract useful work .
So ( again ignoring quantum effects for the moment ) , if you know the states of all the molecules in a glass of hot water , it is cold in a genuinely thermodynamic sense : you can take electricity out of it and leave behind an ice cube .
This does n't violate Liouville 's Theorem , because if Y is the water , and you are Maxwell 's Demon ( denoted M ) , the physical process behaves as :
M1,Y1 -> M1,Y1
M2,Y2 -> M2,Y1
M3,Y3 -> M3,Y1
M4,Y4 -> M4,Y1
Because Maxwell 's demon knows the exact state of Y , this is mutual information between M and Y .
The mutual information decreases the joint entropy of ( M , Y ) : H( M , Y ) = H ( M ) + H(Y ) - I ( M ; Y ) .
M has 2 bits of entropy , Y has two bits of entropy , and their mutual information is 2 bits , so ( M , Y ) has a total of 2 + 2 - 2 = 2 bits of entropy .
The physical process just transforms the " coldness " ( negentropy ) of the mutual information to make the actual water cold - afterward , M has 2 bits of entropy , Y has 0 bits of entropy , and the mutual information is 0 .
Nothing wrong with that !
And do n't tell me that knowledge is " subjective " .
Knowledge has to be represented in a brain , and that makes it as physical as anything else .
For M to physically represent an accurate picture of the state of Y , M's physical state must correlate with the state of Y .
You can take thermodynamic advantage of that - it 's called a Szilard engine .
Or as E.T. Jaynes put it , " The old adage ' knowledge is power ' is a very cogent truth , both in human relations and in thermodynamics . "
And conversely , one subsystem cannot increase in mutual information with another subsystem , without ( a ) interacting with it and ( b ) doing thermodynamic work .
Otherwise you could build a Maxwell 's Demon and violate the Second Law of Thermodynamics - which in turn would violate Liouville 's Theorem - which is prohibited in the standard model of physics .
Which is to say :
To form accurate beliefs about something , you really do have to observe it .
It 's a very physical , very real process : any rational mind does " work " in the thermodynamic sense , not just the sense of mental effort .
( It is sometimes said that it is erasing bits in order to prepare for the next observation that takes the thermodynamic work - but that distinction is just a matter of words and perspective ; the math is unambiguous . )
( Discovering logical " truths " is a complication which I will not , for now , consider - at least in part because I am still thinking through the exact formalism myself .
In thermodynamics , knowledge of logical truths does not count as negentropy ; as would be expected , since a reversible computer can compute logical truths at arbitrarily low cost .
All this that I have said is true of the logically omniscient : any lesser mind will necessarily be less efficient . )
" Forming accurate beliefs requires a corresponding amount of evidence " is a very cogent truth both in human relations and in thermodynamics : if blind faith actually worked as a method of investigation , you could turn warm water into electricity and ice cubes .
Just build a Maxwell 's Demon that has blind faith in molecule velocities .
Engines of cognition are not so different from heat engines , though they manipulate entropy in a more subtle form than burning gasoline .
For example , to the extent that an engine of cognition is not perfectly efficient , it must radiate waste heat , just like a car engine or refrigerator .
" Cold rationality " is true in a sense that Hollywood scriptwriters never dreamed ( and false in the sense that they did dream ) .
So unless you can tell me which specific step in your argument violates the laws of physics by giving you true knowledge of the unseen , do n't expect me to believe that a big , elaborate clever argument can do it either .
ARG has had a pretty unreliable record this primary season .
But this is a pretty stark shift .
ARG ’s Pennsylvania poll taken on April 5 - 6 had a Clinton - Obama tie at 45 % .
Today they have a new poll out , taken April 11 - 13 , shows a 20 point spread .
Clinton 57 % , Obama 37 % .
As a control , the two national tracking polls seem to show no discernible shift .
Rasmussen ’s held steady since the 11th , with a small and statistically insignificant increase for Obama .
Gallup ’s has also been essentially static .
But their number for today has yet to be released .
But it ’s also true that coverage of this story in Pennsylvania has likely been as intense as anywhere in the country .
Prohibits persons under age 19 from smoking or carrying a lighted tobacco product in an outdoor public place .
An Act concerning the use of tobacco products by persons under 19 years of age and supplementing chapter 170 of Title 2A of the New Jersey Statutes .
Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey :
1 . The Legislature finds and declares that :
a. Since 1964 , the Surgeon General of the United States , the highest - ranking public health officer in the nation , has produced 28 reports by recognized medical experts on the use of tobacco ; and , in each report , leading scientists have found that using tobacco causes people to become sick , disabled , or die ;
b . These reports have determined that smoking is the single greatest avoidable cause of disease and death in the United States ;
c. Cigarette smoking harms nearly every organ of the body and has been directly linked to : various forms of cancer , including bladder , esophageal , laryngeal , lung , oral , and throat cancers ; arteriosclerosis and coronary heart disease ; congestive heart failure ; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ; reproductive health problems ; sudden infant death syndrome among babies whose mothers smoke during pregnancy ; and other diseases that adversely affect a person ’s general health ;
d. People who smoke are more likely to be absent from work , have longer illnesses , incur more medical costs , see physicians more often in outpatient settings , and be admitted to the hospital more often and for longer periods than nonsmokers ;
e. Exposure to secondhand smoke causes disease and premature death in children and adults who do not smoke ;
f . The smoking of tobacco is almost always initiated and established in adolescence , typically by 16 years of age ;
g. Because nicotine addiction occurs during adolescence , adolescent tobacco users are likely to become adult tobacco users ;
h. Tobacco use is associated with alcohol and illicit drug use ; and tobacco is generally the first drug used by young people who enter a sequence of drug use that can include alcohol , marijuana , and harder drugs , the purchase , possession , or use of which by minors is already prohibited by law ;
i . Active smoking by young people is associated with significant health problems during childhood and adolescence , and with increased risk for health problems in adulthood ;
j. The United States Department of Health and Human Services estimates that more than 3,000 children nationwide start smoking every day , and that more than three million American children under age 18 consume more than 947 million packs of cigarettes annually ;
k. Major manufacturers of cigarettes and other tobacco products have stated their belief that minors should not smoke or have access to cigarettes ;
l. The State of New Jersey statutorily prohibits the sale or distribution of tobacco in any form to persons under 19 years of age and the smoking of tobacco in indoor public places and workplaces , and municipalities throughout this State are authorized by law to adopt ordinances that restrict smoking in public places ; and
m . It must be the public policy of this State to deter children and adolescents from smoking tobacco and thereby seek to protect them from the scourge of tobacco - related disease , disability , and death .
2. a .
It shall be unlawful for a person under 19 years of age to smoke or carry a lighted cigarette , or other tobacco product that can be smoked , in an outdoor public place .
As used in this act , “ outdoor public place " means an outdoor place to which the public has access , including a public street , road , thoroughfare , sidewalk , bridge , alley , plaza , park , recreation or shopping area , parking lot , or any other outdoor public structure or area .
b. A person who violates the provisions of subsection a. of this section shall be liable to the following :
( 1 ) for a first offense : issuance of a written warning by a law enforcement officer , which may include parental notification of the violation by the law enforcement officer ;
( 2 ) for a second offense : assignment , by the municipal court having jurisdiction , to perform community service for a maximum of 25 hours ; and participation in an educational program on the dangers of smoking tobacco , as designated by the court ; and
( 3 ) for a third and each subsequent offense : assignment , by the municipal court having jurisdiction , to perform community service for a maximum of 50 hours ; and a civil penalty of $ 75 , to be collected pursuant to the " Penalty Enforcement Law of 1999 , " P.L.1999 , c.274 ( C.2A:58 - 10 et seq. ) , in a summary proceeding before the court .
c. A law enforcement officer having enforcement authority in that municipality may issue a summons for a violation of the provisions of this act , and may serve and execute all process with respect to the enforcement of this act consistent with the Rules of Court .
A penalty recovered under the provisions of this act shall be recovered by and in the name of the State by the local health agency and shall be paid into the treasury of the municipality in which the violation occurred for the general uses of the municipality .
3 . This act shall take effect on the 60th day after enactment .

Jon Stewart and company look at John McCain 's attempt to allow voters to get to know him better by stopping at important locales of his personal biography , like Annapolis , where he attended flight school .
Hmm ... do you think he mentioned graduating at the bottom of his class ?
Watch how the media -- if they pay any attention to him at all - - goes along with this nostalgia tour without picking up on the fact that so much of Grandpa McCain 's history happened so long ago , like Harry Smith conveniently coming out with McCain 's high school yearbook ( without pointing out that it 's been more than 50 years ) .
Anyway , this type of bus tour is bound to give McCain the kind of coverage he ’s craving .
He spoke at Annapolis this morning at 9:17 am .
Let ’s see how the cable news covered him : [ shows MSNBC ] oh , that ’s gotta hurt .
Obama giving a speech at the same time .
McCain got Barack - blocked .

OTTAWA — Federal Liberals are asking the RCMP to launch a criminal probe into allegations that the Conservatives tried to buy the support of an Independent MP in the days leading up to a crucial vote in 2005 .
In a letter to RCMP Commissioner William Elliott today , Liberals say a police probe is needed to examine " very serious allegations regarding potential criminal activity by representatives of the Conservative Party of Canada . "
According to a new book by Vancouver journalist Tom Zytaruk , two Conservative officials met with Chuck Cadman , then dying of cancer , and tried to lure him back to the Tory caucus with the promise of a $ 1 million life insurance policy just two days before the crucial May 19 , 2005 vote .
" The Tories actually walked in with a list of offers written down on a piece of paper .
Included in their proposal was a $ 1 million life insurance policy - no small carrot for a man with advanced cancer , " says the new book , titled Like A Rock : The Chuck Cadman Story .
Prime Minister Stephen Harper denied the allegations , saying nothing was offered to Cadman before the vote .
" This is completely false , completely irresponsible , " Harper said in question period .
But if true , the attempt would constitute a criminal offence .
" As I am sure you will agree , any allegations of financial inducements being offered to an elected public official in an attempt to influence that individual must be treated with the utmost seriousness , " Liberal MP Dominic LeBlanc ( Beauséjour ) wrote in his letter to the RCMP .
" There is an obvious and significant public interest in determining whether or not officials from the Conservative Party of Canada engaged in attempts to bribe an elected public official for their own political and material gain , " LeBlanc wrote .
Cadman sided with the minority Liberals , ensuring the survival of Paul Martin 's government .
Cadman died a few months later .
However , in an interview with CTV News this afternoon , Cadman 's widow Dona confirmed that Tory officials had met with her husband to woo his vote .
" Two gentlemen had visited him , offered him a million dollar life insurance policy and a few other things , " she said .

Asked whether she considered it a bribe , she responded , " Yes , in a way . "
Cadman rejected the overture and was quite upset by the suggestion that his support could be bought , said his wife , who is now the Conservative candidate in the Surrey North riding once represented by her husband .
The new CEO of Virgin Media is putting his cards on the table early , branding net neutrality " a load of bollocks " and claiming he 's already doing deals to deliver some people 's content faster than others .
If you are n't prepared to cough up the extra cash , he says he 'll put you in the Internet " bus lane " .
Net neutrality really is the hot topic at the moment .
Ignited by the Comcast fiasco , the concept of net neutrality has certainly been brought into the mainstream .
Most ISPs are never quite forthcoming about their throttling , capping and otherwise interfering behavior , but that crowd certainly does n’t include the CEO of Virgin Media , the UK ’s second largest ISP .
In an interview with the Royal Television Society ’s Television magazine , far from covering up their intentions , Virgin Media ’s new incoming CEO Neil Berkett – who joined the Virgin Media Board just a few days ago – has launched an attack on the ideas and principles behind net neutrality .
“ This net neutrality thing is a load of bollocks , ” he said , adding that Virgin is already in the process of doing deals to speed up the traffic of certain media providers .
With around 3.5 million customers in the UK , and already traffic shaping due to lack of capacity , it ’s a sobering thought that at the behest of “ content providers ” with deep pockets , Virgin is prepared to speed up their traffic , which would presumably have a negative impact on those at the bottom of the ISP ’s priority list , namely bandwidth hungry file - sharers .
Berkett then turned on the BBC and their iPlayer service , telling them – and other public broadcasters like them – that if they do n’t pay a premium to gain faster access to Virgin Media ’s customers , their service would be put into “ bus lanes ” .
It just shows that some ISPs are happy to throttle just about anyone in the name of profit , it ’s just that most are n’t as open about it as Mr Berkett .

The cabinet ’s promised ban on the sale of hallucinogenic mushrooms is set to come in before the summer , the Volkskrant reports on Monday .
Ministers agreed to the ban on the sale of fresh mushrooms , which is supported by a majority of MPs , on Friday evening .
The sale of dried mushrooms is already illegal .
The Netherlands has an estimated 350 so - called smart shops selling mushrooms and other legal substances that make people high .
The ban on the sale of hallucinogenic mushrooms follows several serious incidents involving tourists who had eaten mushrooms .
What age is the right age to have “ the talk , ” not just about where babies come from , but also about sex and AIDS ?
How about , oh , 4 ?
A new documentary , “ Please Talk to Kids About AIDS , ” raises this question in a cute but discomfiting way .
So far it has been seen only at film festivals and at schools of public health , including those at Harvard and Johns Hopkins .
But the film will soon be available at www.eztakes.com/Talk-to-Kids.
I saw it last month at a Gay Men ’s Health Crisis screening for AIDS counselors .
In it , two incredibly sweet and precocious sisters  Vineeta and Sevilla Hennessey , ages 6 and 4  accompany their parents , the filmmakers , to the 2006 International AIDS Conference in Toronto .
They interview top AIDS experts , gay activists , condom distributors , a sex toy saleswoman , a cross - dresser playing Queen Elizabeth II and an Indian transgender hijra in a sari .
The startling aspect is that , as one childish question leads to the next , they ask things like : “ How does AIDS get into your body ? ” and “ How come they want to have sex with each other ? ”
ICE CREAM is as much a part of Italian culture as a morning espresso .
But even the gelato - loving Italians do n't spend as much on the stuff as the Finns .
Expenditure on ice cream in cooler Finland averaged $ 109.90 per person in 2005 , licking Italy's $ 106.47 , according to Euromonitor , a market - research company .
Eastern European countries shell out least , with Romania spending only $ 4 per person .

In 1992 , construction workers retrofitting UCLA ’s undergraduate library discovered many dusty boxes hidden behind a bookshelf in the basement .
The boxes contained research materials and questionnaires from a pioneering 1965 study on Mexican Americans .
Sociology professors Vilma Ortiz and Edward Telles skimmed the surveys , which included names and addresses .
That ’s when they decided to embark on an ambitious project : re-interviewing the families and assessing the integration of Mexican Americans over time .
“ We stumbled onto something , ” Ortiz said .
“ That was the beginning . ”
The professors had a simple hypothesis : that there would be improvement over generations and time , much as with other immigrant groups that settled in the U.S .
Advertisement
The UCLA professors re-interviewed about 700 of the original participants and about 800 of their children , in Los Angeles and San Antonio .
Participants constituted about 60 % of the original families .
Some of the findings were encouraging .
For example , nearly all Mexican Americans spoke English proficiently by the second generation .
And many Mexican immigrants who came to the U.S. as children -- as well as the children of immigrants -- showed economic and educational progress , in part because of their belief in the American dream .
But some of the conclusions -- published last month in a book titled “ Generations of Exclusion : Mexican Americans , Assimilation and Race ” -- were disappointing .
For example , a disproportionately high percentage of third - and fourth - generation Mexican Americans did not graduate from high school or seek higher education .
And income levels in these later generations were not as high as the authors expected .

“ At the same time there are people clearly reaching middle class and having successful careers , there is also a high proportion who have low levels of education , ” Telles said .
“ The low education determines just about everything else , including integration into American society . ”
The authors offered several explanations for the lack of assimilation over time , including racial discrimination and continued immigration .
But most important , they cited an underfunded public education system that has placed low expectations on Mexican Americans and failed to effectively educate them .
“ Public education is the greatest source of Mexican American exclusion , in that low education impedes their economic prospects , ” they wrote .
Joe and Theresa Nevarez , who were interviewed for the original study and again for the follow - up , both said they faced the low expectations and discrimination that the UCLA professors described .

Joe Nevarez , 96 , came to the U.S. with his parents when he was a baby and later became a citizen .
Theresa , 85 , was born in the U.S. , as was her mother .
Both said they were funneled into trade programs during high school -- Joe into the print shop and Theresa into beautician classes .
While in school , Joe wrote about sports for the campus ’ daily newspaper .
Despite expectations otherwise , both graduated from high school .
But nobody suggested college to either one .
Joe became a copy boy and then a staff writer at the Los Angeles Times , where he worked for more than 50 years .
When he started , Nevarez said , he was one of “ few Hispanic names in the press . ”
He later joined the Chicano News Media Assn .
He also served briefly in the Army Air Forces , working as a clerk and an assistant to a chaplain .
In a photograph of his squadron of dozens of men , he said , “ I ’m the only dark face . ”

The couple married in 1944 at La Placita Church near Olvera Street and moved to East Los Angeles .
“ They would n’t sell us a house because we were Hispanic , ” Theresa said , even with her husband in uniform .
After agreeing to put up one - third of the price as a down payment , the couple were able to purchase a home .
They paid it off in 10 years and moved to Monterey Park because the schools had a good reputation .
At the time , all of their neighbors were white .
“ They did n’t look too kindly at us until it got around I was a newspaperman , ” he said .
“ Then it was all OK . ”
They raised three children , who all went to college .

“ I told them , ‘ You have to have an education , ’ ” Theresa Nevarez said .
“ Because of our color and our name , you have to struggle a little bit harder . ”
The couple also made it a point to expose their children to museums , beaches , libraries and amusement parks .
But the children , too , encountered difficulties because of their ethnicity .
One of their sons was beaten up while he was in grade school and denied entrance to the local Scout troop .
One of their daughters , Margaret Nevarez , 61 , is a high school counselor .
Her sister works as a vice principal in the Los Angeles Unified School District , and her brother has retired from the Internal Revenue Service .
Margaret said she was always aware of the challenges her parents faced because they were Mexican American .

“ I did n’t want that kind of circumstance for my life , ” she said .
“ I wanted my kids to have choices . ”
Harry Pachon , president of the Tomas Rivera Policy Institute , said that he had not read the UCLA study but that his own research has shown an economic mobility among Latinos , who are moving into the middle class in large numbers and penetrating every level of California ’s political culture .
Significant numbers of Latinos make more than $ 100,000 a year and they are buying homes in neighborhoods from San Marino to Bel - Air , he said .
“ Those are not nannies and housekeepers , ” he said .
“ There are Latinos who have made economic and sociopolitical progress . ”

Russia has a long history of scientific discovery and space exploration through the use of animals .
Beginning with space dog Laika in 1957 , the space program expanded to run tests on other dogs ( many returned safely to Earth ) and eventually monkeys .
Although the monkey testing program was stopped through lack of funding in the mid-1990 ’s , the nation has announced plans to send the closest relation to humans to a place where no man has gone before : Mars .
And here ’s us thinking it will be a human first stepping onto the Martian surface …
I must admit , I had to read the story twice before I believed it .
Russia wants to send monkeys not only into space , but to Mars .
I had an idea that monkeys ( or more specifically macaques ) were used in space missions in the past , but in my mind this was in the past and would be considered cruel in this day and age .
But hold on , are n’t macaques used in medical experiments the world over anyway ?
Why is it so shocking that macaques should be chosen to pioneer interplanetary travel before mankind ?
These questions are emotive ( and controversial ) and will cause much debate internationally .
Many will believe that the experimental testing on animals in the ultra - modern world of space travel will seem barbaric , but there are some serious problems we might definitively answer through the use of macaque space travel .
First and foremost , due to the interplanetary radiation we expect to be bathed in during a transit to Mars , by studying a macaque ’s physiology during the long journey we may be able to learn how the human body will react to larger than normal doses .
The fact remains , monkeys are genetically close to humans , its little wonder that we turn to them for answers .
To this end , monkeys at the Sochi Institute of Medical Primatology , at Vesyoloye near the Black Sea , have begun the selection process for the ultimate medical animal testing experiment .
The institute has a long history of involvement in the Russian and Soviet space program .
Sochi was the training facility for the first monkeys into space in 1983 .
Abrek and Bion had a five - day trip around Earth and were returned safely in Kazakhstan and rehabilitated to live “ normal lives ” .
Two years after this historic flight , monkeys Verny and Gordy spent seven days in space .
In 1987 , Dryoma and Yerosha spent a record breaking ( for a monkey - assisted flight ) two - weeks in space .
Interestingly , Dryoma was given to Cuban leader Fidel Castro as a gift .
Following this , in 1989 , 1992 and 1996 , three two - week flights were carried out until funding for the project ran out .
Now experiments have been continued on Earth to simulate weightlessness .
Now , to revitalize Sochi ’s history of macaque space flight , they are beginning a two - year program to select 40 monkeys to be sent to the Institute of Biomedical Problems in Moscow so tests can be continued into aerospace biomedicine .
This will culminate in a possible primate mission to Mars .
“ People and monkeys have approximately identical sensitivity to small and large radiation doses , so it is better to experiment on the macaques , but not on dogs or other animals . ”
Boris Lapin , Institute Director .
Critics of the program are frustrated by the use of animal testing in any capacity , but remain realistic about the situation .
“ Humanity sacrifices more than 100 million animals a year in the name of health and beauty .
It ’s time to think of an alternative to experiments with animals , ” says Andrei Zbarsky of the conservation group the World Wildlife Fund ( WWF ) .
“ … certainly , I feel sorry for the monkeys , they might die , but the experiments are necessary to preserve the lives of the cosmonauts who will fly to Mars in future ” – Anaida Shaginyan , Institute Researcher .
This will be a controversial measure by the Russian space program and they are expecting resistance from their European partners .
Although monkeys and other animals are used in medical science here on Earth , it might prove too distasteful and cruel for most , but possibly the only means to measure the physical impact on the human body after a long trip to Mars .

One of the more interesting sub-debates associated with Atheism vs. Religion is that of free will .
Quite simply , many Atheists do n’t believe in it at all , while the majority of traditional believers feel that God gave them the ability to shape their own lives by clearly making decisions for themselves .
I personally do n’t believe in it .
My reason for this stance is actually very simple : I believe in nature .
I believe that the world unfolds according to the dynamics of a nearly infinite number of variables interacting with each other .
Just because there are trillions and trillions of them does n’t make their interactions magical ( or even special ) .
These variables include our genetics , our experiences , what chemicals are in our bodies at a given time , our immediate environment , etc .
But ultimately , every action that a human takes when they ’re “ deciding ” what to do is simply the output from one particular variable - set interaction .
Our brains are nothing but a collection of chemicals sloshing back and forth .
These chemicals interact with each other in a finite , knowable way .
The only reason we are n’t able to predict human behavior today is because we do n’t have a solid grasp of the actors involved .
This is really no different from our inability to predict the weather 100 years ago .
And how did we come to be able to do so ?
We simply became more capable of gathering information about the variables .
By this point you either already agree with me or you do n’t .
If you do n’t then I doubt I ’m going to muster up the firepower while casually writing this post to convince you .
So for the purposes of the rest of this piece I ’ll assume that you do agree with my main premise .
The Implications
What I find far more interesting than the fact that we do n’t have free will are the implications thereof .
Think of what it means for society — for human civilization as a whole .
It turns out that just about everything in our society is based solidly in the notion that we do make decisions for ourselves .
What about our moral and legal systems ?
How do you punish someone for actions they took when no choices were really made ?
And what does this say about class and privilege ?
Does n’t it sort of naturally lead to the doctrines of eugenics and elitism ?
I think it clearly does .
And what does this say about the uniqueness of humans ?
We ’ve all heard about our ability to be logical and reason our way out of problems .
Is this all an illusion ?
Given our lack of free will , what is actually taking place when one sits down to ponder a philosophical question or write brilliant prose ?
Are we simply rocking back and forth in our little train car , trying to move a bit farther ahead on a biological track that we can never leave ?
It ’s as if what we see as “ discovery ” and “ growth ” are in reality no different than a growing snowflake .
It ’s beautiful to watch , and it definitely follows a form worth giving a name to , but ultimately the snowflake is doing precisely the only thing that it can do , given the conditions .
The Solution
In terms of human society , the answer is actually stunningly simple : we simply forget that we even had this discussion .
Free will is , for all intents and purposes , a necessary delusion .
To discuss the fact that it is n’t real truly serves no practical purpose other than that of an intellectual exercise .
Our civilization simply could not advance in any positive way if this way of thinking were used to create policy .
Normally I abhor the idea of rejecting truth in order to make life temporarily more pleasant , but in this case I make an exception . :
CARACAS , Venezuela 
The oil giant Exxon Mobil has won court orders freezing as much as $ 12 billion in petroleum assets controlled by Venezuela ’s government in an escalation of a dispute over efforts by President Hugo Chávez to assert greater control over the country ’s oil industry .
Venezuela ’s dollar - denominated bonds suffered their steepest drop in six months on Thursday on concerns that Mr. Chávez ’s government could face a protracted legal battle with Exxon , preventing the government from raising cash through the sale of refineries abroad if the economy here slows after years of torrid growth .
Investors are also increasingly concerned about the financial health of the national oil company , Petróleos de Venezuela , amid reports that its debt is ballooning as its output declines .
The oil company is the largest single source of revenue for Mr. Chávez ’s government , financing an array of social welfare projects and foreign aid to leftist allies .
The globalisation of football is a fact – once that genie got out of the bottle , there is no way on earth , heaven or hell that you could put it back in .
Football is now a universal game , and it will continue to grow as the # 1 sport around the world .
The commodification of football is also a fact ( for the more discerning amongst you , “ commodification of football ” is used in both Marxist and capitalist terms – read more about ‘ commodification ‘ ) – once money became a significant factor in determining the performances of a football club , there was no going back and now , we have a sport that walks , talks and breathes capitalism .
The combined effects of globalisation and the adoption of capitalism have transformed football – from a local , non-business sport it has turned into a worldwide money - spinning phenomenon .
The sheer surge of emotions attached to football brings with it an opportunity to make money – a LOT of money – and today we ’re seeing the after - effects , as power and money is consolidated at the top of the pile and everyone else who does n’t have the resources ( a majority , obviously ) is against this influx of money .
Of course , it has a lot more to do with not having as much money as someone else as opposed to a reaction against money in football ( although it is rationalised as the latter ) …
This is not about whether money in football is good or not ( ditto for football ’s globalisation ) .
One , that is a different debate and two , it is quite impossible to take money ( or the global factor ) out of the game without crashing the current system .
It ’s a bit like yanking the technology out of our societies because we do n’t want to pollute the environment – it ’s not going to happen .
The challenge is to go forward and forge a system that respects football ’s most importance asset ( the passion from fans and players for their teams ) and still allows the people involved to make money .
Do n’t tell me that it ca n’t happen – it can happen as long as we , as fans , have a positive attitude work towards solutions instead of shooting each other ’s ideas down .
So …in this environment where money has an increasing larger say in shaping football ’s future , the people without money ( or rather , people with less money ) overwhelmingly outnumber those that have a lot of it .
How Mobs Are Manipulated
And before anyone talks about how rising ticket prices are a symptom of how money is damaging football , allow me to draw your attention to amount of money Chelsea ( with a 42 k capacity ground ) and Arsenal ( with a 60 k capacity ground ) are making through their home games as compared to Manchester United ( with a 76 k capacity ground ) .
Matchday Earnings ( 2006/2007 )
Team Matchday
Earnings Home
Games Revenue
per Match Seating
Capacity Revenue
per Seat** Man Utd £ 92.5 m 29 £ 3.2 m 76,212 £ 41.85 Arsenal £ 90.6 m 29 £ 3.1 m 60,355 £ 51.76 Chelsea £ 74.5 m 31 * £ 2.4 m 42,055 £ 57.14
* estimate , please correct if wrong
** EACH matchday
And yet , all we hear is how Manchester United ’s ticket prices are hurting the fans .
It ’s an easy story to sell because the fans are already worried about the debt , whereas Chelsea and Arsenal fans are happier with their owners and thus it ’s not so easy to sell them on the idea that the owners of their clubs are out to screw them over for their money .
Even when you factor in the rise in costs because of being in London as opposed to Manchester , at the very least , the three clubs are equal in terms of what they charge for their seats .
And here we are , hearing about United ’s extortion and not about Arsenal ’s or Chelsea’s .
We expect the media to keep us informed of what ’s going on in the world and in football .
Unfortunately , the media is looking right back at us , trying to figure what will generate the strongest emotions ( and thus get more sales / more hits on their websites / higher tv audience ) and thus we are hardly ever told the truth – instead , we hear news designed to get a reaction out of us , narratives in black and white that are far away from the truth .
Hence the largely positive reaction for the Liverpool and Newcastle takeovers , even though in recent times owners from both sides have come under serious criticism – because once the initial euphoria died and results failed to materialise on the pitch , fans were more open to reacting to the truth .
Hicks and Gillett borrowed heavily and do n’t trust Rafa as much as the fans .
Mike Ashley ’s past business dealings got a lot more air recently with the attempt to paint him as a reckless , unreliable businessman – right after he brought Keegan onboard as manager .
In politics and advertising ( and any other public - dealing sector ) , this is known as having the pulse of the masses .
When this knowledge is used to misinform and manipulate , it can have serious consequences for the future .
In recent elections in Pakistan , we have experienced first - hand how the masses – the mob – can be manipulated to further harm the country .
Regardless of what you might think about Musharraf and indeed about democracy , there is no doubt that the masses in Pakistan were against him , whipped into a frenzy by his political opposition .
Now , after the elections , the two political parties everyone was happy to see the back of in 1999 are presumably back in power and more , are forming a coalition .
The very corrupt politicians that we wanted out as a nation are back in power 9 years later , and they have the mob ’s mandate .
Things will get a lot worse in Pakistan – in the blind rush to oust Musharraf completely from power , the people have been conned into electing worse individuals in his place .
So much for democracy , so much for respecting public opinion .
The mob rule in football is akin to the picture at the start of this article ( rss readers please clickthrough ) – emotional , angry and misguided .
I remember back in 2005 / 2006 , when the move to get President Bush impeached gained momentum in the aftermath of Katrina , many young bloggers banded together to sign petitions and raise awareness .
They were eloquent , driven and inspirational .
But when I asked them ( several times ) about what they had in mind post - impeachment – where they saw the US going after Bush was forced out – they had no answers .
They had n’t thought that far ahead , it was a case of Anyone But Bush , and reason and forward - thinking be damned .
Game 39 and the Mob
We ’ve had a similar reaction to the Game 39 proposal in football .
I ’m not for it , nor am I against it .
However , I think it ’s an idea worth exploring further and if Richard Scudamore , an extremely successful businessman , thinks that it is workable keeping Fifa and national FAs happy , then it ’s worth discussing .
Apparently , fans do n’t think so .
You want to know why ?
The Guardian , the Daily Mail , the Telegraph , the Sun , the Independent – heck , even the BBC had their correspondents go full - throttle against the proposal , ridiculing it , bashing Scudamore for being greedy .
So let ’s put things a bit in perspective :
Is Scudamore being greedy ?
No more than a consultant is being greedy when he accepts a speaking gig outside the country once a year .
No more than a local musician who goes on a tour abroad to cash in on his growing global appeal .
No more than athletes who participate in events globally in sports that leverage their own global popularity .
You might argue that the above examples do not apply to football – I beg to differ .
Football has a global audience and is a global commodity .
Fans around the world are going to want to watch their favourite teams , they want to buy products and get a chance to see the players they support and idolise .
Wherever you have talent , you have the opportunity to export that talent .
What the Premier League is doing makes perfect business sense , drives money back into English football and also helps improve local infrastructure .
There are problems , yes , but none of them are insurmountable and have been discussed , in detail , here and here .
Money , as I said at the start , is now an integral part of football .
We ’re not going to be able to take it out .
The challenge is not to reduce the size of the pie , but to increase it AND ensure that it is more evenly distributed .
If the Premier League can be convinced to give a greater share to the Football League , would this make the venture more palatable ?
If the Premier League apportioned a percentage of their earnings from Game 39 to local charities and football development , would that make the venture more palatable ?
Are we against the Premier League ( and therefore , others , NOT us ) making more money or are we against inequality in football ?
There ’s a difference there , ladies and gentlemen – one is a selfish , knee - jerk reaction to cover one ’s own inadequacies and the other is a principled stance to proactively improve football .
Which side are you on ?
In the rush to discredit the Game 39 proposal , the press went out and branded Roy Keane , one of the early supporters of the scheme , as a ‘ rent - a - quote ’ manager .
Easy to manipulate public opinion against someone who was hated by most opposition fans just a couple of years ago .
Not so easy to manipulate public opinion against Arsene Wenger , a man well - respected all around the footballing world .
Sepp Blatter The Bully
The most amusing outcome of this whole situation was how people used Sepp Blatter ’s opposition ( and schoolyard bullying techniques ) as proof that Game 39 was a bad idea .
Without going into details , here ’s a search on Google for ‘ Sepp Blatter idiot ‘ – go ahead , knock yourself out and read all the top 10 entries .
Blatter more or less called Italy cheats in order to get a favorable reaction in Australia .
He advocates that women ’s football should be more feminine – and that ’s the most politically correct way to convey his words .
He is the classic blundering fool that football fans dislike with a vengeance , and yet you believe his words only when he disagrees with what you disagree .
Relying on Blatter ’s judgment in this case makes you a moron , unless you too , agree with everything else he says .
Blatter ’s bullying of the English FA – threatening to sideline the bid for the 2018 World Cup – is what SHOULD worry English football fans .
How are the two things – Game 39 and 2018 World Cup – even related ?
We have a situation where the local game ( outside the Premier League ) could get a mind - bogglingly huge boost in terms of investment and exposure , where the local economy will flourish before and after the event ( see Germany 2006 ) , and yet when that is threatened , what do England - based fans – the people standing to benefit the most from the event – do in response ?
They applaud .
English fans should be taking a stand against this brand of bullying ( and the sickening way the FA have folded because of it ) – it is quite possible that if Blatter can use this strategy to get his way on one issue , he can use the same stick to beat upon on England on other issues .
How many concessions – to a man whose judgment is questionable at best – would these knowledgeable and in - the - right football fans be willing to give ?
A different Perspective on Game 39
The reaction from elsewhere in the world has stemmed from two things – the media coverage of the proposal ( which has been actively biased against it ) and the words of one Sepp Blatter .
Several associations around the world have opposed Game 39 – based on the common assumption that this would undermine the local leagues .
That is half the story .
If you were to export the whole Premier League season , then yes , it would seriously undermine the local leagues .
However , one weekend per year would amount to a financial bonanza and would do nothing to draw people away from the local game .
The global attention that the area will receive will in return boost the investment and exposure given to the local game .
In other words , Game 39 CAN be used to benefit local football development – if you play it that way .
Not surprisingly , the more enterprising and forwarding thinking football associations have realised the potential and the MLS , the UAE , the Hong Kong FA and Australia are more open to having the Premier League visit and play , as long as Fifa accepts it ( if you are wondering then yes , Blatter has effectively bullied all federations to oppose the proposal ) .
While Scudamore puts on a confident face ( he must have known that the reaction would be this vicious , so he seems to have a gameplan ) and knows that the FA is only worried about Fifa and the 2018 World Cup , not about the proposal itself , one wonders if the Game 39 proposal is dead in the water ( do you expect Blatter to go back on his word and allow the proposal , considering that he has openly said that it wo n’t go ahead as long as he is Fifa president ? ) – and that saddens me , because as football fans , we ’ve blown the first real opportunity in a long time to bring a positive change to football .
In our haste to deny the people at the top a chance to make money , we have effectively denied the chance for all of football to make more money and therefore denied football a chance to grow and prosper in areas where it desperately needs help .
Game 39 could have been used to improve matters – extract a greater share from the Premier League ( as the FA wanted ) and investing in football development around the world ( as some FAs around the world anticipated ) .
Instead , we ’re creating false obstacles – how the fans are being shortchanged being the most common one .
Broadcasting / Commercial Revenue ( 2006/2007 )
Man Utd : £ 61.5 m + £ 58.1 m = £ 119.6 m Arsenal : £ 44.3 m + £ 42.7 m = £ 87.0 m Chelsea : £ 59.6 m + £ 56.4 m = £ 116.0 m
I ’m going to hazard a guess that if you took out the non-England - based fans for these three clubs , the revenues here would be slashed by half ( as always , comment if you think the assumption is incorrect ) .
Therefore , considering that global fans have a significant financial contribution to make to their clubs , would you agree that domestic fans SHOULD share an EXTRA game with these global fans ?
Surely , it ’s just one weekend guys , the league is n’t getting up and moving abroad .
Or are we so blind that we fail to see our own greed , this time for perceived ownership of a club that is partially funded by its global audience ?
Game 39 ’s Future
I strongly hope that the Game 39 proposal gets a chance to be discussed properly and all the details – how the fixtures will be handled , how local football will benefit , how the Premier League will funnel that money back into the grassroots of football – are made public and put up for debate .
Let ’s look at the facts and the real issues , and not at our own greed and insecurities .

The Moon and the Magnetotail
Tony Phillips
NASA 's Goddard Space Flight Center
Behold the full moon .
Ancient craters and frozen lava seas lie motionless under an airless sky of profound quiet .
It ’s a serene , slow - motion world where even a human footprint may last millions of years .
Nothing ever seems to happen there , right ?
Wrong .
NASA - supported scientists have realized that something happens every month when the moon gets a lashing from Earth ’s magnetic tail .
“ Earth ’s magnetotail extends well beyond the orbit of the moon and , once a month , the moon orbits through it , ” says Tim Stubbs , a University of Maryland scientist working at the Goddard Space Flight Center .
“ This can have consequences ranging from lunar ‘ dust storms ’ to electrostatic discharges .
” Yes , Earth does have a magnetic tail .
It is an extension of the same familiar magnetic field we experience when using a Boy Scout compass to find our way around Earth ’s surface .
Our entire planet is enveloped in a bubble of magnetism , which springs from a molten dynamo in Earth ’s core .
Out in space , the solar wind presses against this bubble and stretches it , creating a long “ magnetotail ” in the downwind direction .
Anyone can tell when the moon is inside the magnetotail .
Just look : “ If the moon is full , it is inside the magnetotail , ” says Stubbs .
“ The moon enters the magnetotail three days before it is full and takes about six days to cross and exit on the other side .
” It is during those six days that strange things can happen .
During the crossing , the moon comes in contact with a gigantic “ plasma sheet ” of hot charged particles trapped in the tail .
The lightest and most mobile of these particles , electrons , pepper the moon ’s surface and give the moon a negative charge .
On the moon ’s dayside this effect is counteracted to a degree by sunlight : UV photons knock electrons back off the surface , keeping the build - up of charge at relatively low levels .
But on the nightside , in the cold lunar dark , electrons accumulate and surface voltages can climb to hundreds or thousands of volts .
Imagine what it feels like to be a sock pulled crackling from a dryer .
Astronauts on the moon during a magnetotail crossing might be able to tell you .
Walking across the dusty charged - up lunar terrain , the astronauts themselves would gather a load of excess charge .
Touching another astronaut , a doorknob , a piece of sensitive electronics -- any of these simple actions could produce an unwelcome discharge .
“ Proper grounding is strongly recommended , ” says Stubbs .
The ground , meanwhile , might leap into the sky .
There ’s growing evidence that fine particles of moondust might actually float , ejected from the lunar surface by electrostatic repulsion .
This could create a temporary nighttime atmosphere of dust ready to blacken spacesuits , clog machinery , scratch faceplates ( moondust is very abrasive ) and generally make life difficult for astronauts .
Stranger still , moondust might gather itself into a sort of diaphanous wind .
Drawn by differences in global charge accumulation , floating dust would naturally fly from the strongly - negative nightside to the weakly - negative dayside .
This “ dust storm ” effect would be strongest at the moon ’s terminator , the dividing line between day and night .
Much of this is pure speculation , Stubbs cautions .
No one can say for sure what happens on the moon when the magnetotail hits , because no one has been there at the crucial time .
“ Apollo astronauts never landed on a full moon and they never experienced the magnetotail .
” The best direct evidence comes from NASA ’s Lunar Prospector spacecraft , which orbited the moon in 1998 - 99 and monitored many magnetotail crossings .
During some crossings , the spacecraft sensed big changes in the lunar nightside voltage , jumping “ typically from - 200 V to - 1000 V , ” says Jasper Halekas of UC Berkeley who has been studying the decade - old data .
“ It is important to note , ” says Halekas , “ that the plasma sheet ( where all the electrons come from ) is a very dynamic structure .
The plasma sheet is in a constant state of motion , flapping up and down all the time .
So as the moon orbits through the magnetotail , the plasma sheet can sweep across it many times .
Depending on how dynamic things are , we can encounter the plasma sheet many times during a single pass through the magnetotail with encounters lasting anywhere from minutes to hours or even days .
” “ As a result , you can imagine how dynamic the charging environment on the moon is .
The moon can be just sitting there in a quiet region of the magnetotail and then suddenly all this hot plasma goes sweeping by causing the nightside potential to spike to a kilovolt .
Then it drops back again just as quickly .
” The roller coaster of charge would be at its most dizzying during solar and geomagnetic storms .
“ That is a very dynamic time for the plasma sheet and we need to study what happens then , ” he says .
What happens then ?
Next - generation astronauts are going to find out .
NASA is returning to the moon in the decades ahead and plans to establish an outpost for long - term lunar exploration .
It turns out they ’ll be exploring the magnetotail , too .
Earth ’s magnetotail is n’t the only source of plasma to charge the moon .
Solar wind can provide charged particles , too ; indeed , most of the time , the solar wind is the primary source .
But when the moon enters the magnetotail , the solar wind is pushed back and the plasma sheet takes over .
The plasma sheet is about 10 times hotter than the solar wind and that gives it more " punch " when it comes to altering the charge balance of the moon 's surface .
Two million degree electrons in the plasma sheet race around like crazy and many of them hit the moon 's surface .
Solar wind electrons are relatively cool at only 140 thousand degrees , and fewer of them zip all the way down to the shadowed surface of the moon 's nightside .
Could You Lose a Pound a Week to Save $ 500 ?
A Guest Post
It is devilishly hard to lose weight .
A randomized control year - long study looked at the impact of four different diets ( Atkins , Ornish , Weight Watchers , and Zone Diets ) on a group of overweight and obese subjects who were looking to lose weight .
The diets produced only “ modest ” average weight loss of about 6.4 lbs ( 2.3 percent of original body weight ) and found no statistically significant difference in weight loss for the four different diets .
People do a pretty good job of losing weight for about half a year , and then their weight tends to drift back toward their pre-diet number .
The difficulty of sustaining weight loss can be seen in this figure taken from a 2 - year randomized study of the Weight Watchers program :
The lower line ( marked “ Commercial ” ) shows the average weight loss of the Weight Watchers Diet group , while the upper line ( marked “ Self - Help ” ) shows the average weight loss for the control group dieters .
In this study , Weight Watchers does produce a statistically significant weight loss ( and a loss that is greater than the control group ) , but it is disappointingly small – the average loss after a year is less than 6.5 lbs .
Most overweight people who start a diet want to lose at least 10 percent of their body weight .
But only 16 percent of the Weight Watcher ’s group ( and only 6 percent of control group ) lost 10 percent or more of their body weight at the end of two years .
My personal experience with dieting has followed a similar pattern .
Like many others , I went from being a skinny twenty - something who could n’t gain weight to a forty - something who could n’t keep it off .
In the last decade , I ’ve yoyo - ed several times .
I ’d take off a bunch a weight , but by the end of the year I ’d put it all back on plus a little extra .
Until this last year , when I did something different .
As described in this L.A. Times op - ed , I put $ 500 each week on safely losing and keeping off my extra weight .
You can see what happened in this graph :
I originally had to lose a pound a week ( or else lose money ) .
Then I had to keep my weight below my contractual target of 185 pounds .
In contrast to Weight Watchers , which can cost about $ 500 a year and helps you lose on average 6 or 7 lbs ( about 3 percent of your initial weight ) , I put $ 500 at risk each week .
In equilibrium , I ’ve lost 25 pounds ( 12 percent of my pre-diet body weight ) and so far it has cost me nothing .
The rapid weight loss at the beginning of the graph is not remarkable ; I ’ve lost weight quickly several times before .
What ’s remarkable is that I kept it off for the second half of the year .
And I ’ve signed up again this year to do the same thing .
You can follow my progress here .
As Levitt has written , I also helped create a Web site called StickK.com , where you can enter into your own commitment contract to do all kinds of things .
For me , it ’s been surprisingly easy — five hundred bucks is a lot of money .
And while the prospect of losing 25 pounds is daunting , it ’s not that hard to lose a pound a week when the alternative is to lose $ 500 .
Indeed , StickK contracts invert the normal commitment problem .
Usually it ’s easy for people to make New Year ’s Resolutions , and much harder for them to live up to them .
With StickK , it ’s actually relatively easy to keep your commitments – especially if you put enough at risk , or if you designate an anti-charity to get your money if you fail .
The harder part is getting yourself to make the binding resolution .
Some people are reluctant to enter into a contract that commits them to real change .
Tyler Cowen at Marginal Revolution thinks it ’s so hard to get people to change that he has predicted that the site will not succeed :
I ’ve long predicted this wo n’t work ; one group of potential customers does n’t really want to change , the other group is unwilling to give up control .
It ’s not exaggerating to say that human nature is on the line here , and that if I am wrong this is probably the most important idea you will ever encounter .
But the good news is that the first returns are very positive .
In a little more than a month since launching , people have given us $ 80,000 to help stickK to their goals .
What ’s more , most people are keeping their commitments and getting their money back .
People who really want to change are willing to give up some of their ex-post freedom .
StickK not only helps you make credible commitments for yourself , it also lets you communicate that commitment to other people .
Commitment contracts are n’t just for people who have trouble keeping their commitments ; they are for anyone who is concerned about hearing some promise that just sounds like so much “ cheap talk . ”
We ’ve all been in the “ Lucy holding the football for Charlie Brown ” situation , where we ’ve heard people make promises that we suspect are insincere , or we think the promisor one way or another is n’t likely to follow through .
One of the coolest things about StickK is that it gives the rest of us a new way to respond to cheap talk .
At last , we can demand that the promisor put some money where his or her mouth is .

It ’s sad to reach the point where “ epic fail ” is the most apt term I can come up with to describe an article by Zeldman , but that ’s where I am today .
His article “ Version Targeting : Threat or Menace ? ” in today ’s ALA is so far off the mark that , honestly , I ca n’t come up with any other description .
No , Microsoft is not relevant anymore .
No , the default behavior is not correct .
No , the switch does not solve the problems the IE team claims to be fighting .
No , it is not and never will be my responsibility to help Microsoft maintain its market share .
Seven years ago this week , Zeldman kicked off the standards revolution when he said , “ To hell with bad browsers ” .
Today I say : amen to that , and to hell with “ standards ” advocates who wo n’t stand by that principle .
Several websites running pro-Tibet campaigns have been targeted by internet criminals , it has been claimed .
Experts at ScanSafe , an internet security firm , said that two popular websites - SaveTibet.org and FreeTibet.org - have been specifically targeted by hackers .
It is not clear who is behind the attacks , or what their motivation is , but the cyberstrikes are believed to emanate from computer servers in Taiwan and used a well - known vulnerability in some websites to link to invisible pages .
These then attempt to force computers with inadequate protection to download spying programs , which can be used to track their habits or take control of their machines .
" Our initial analysis suggests that it downloads monitoring software to your computer , which would allow the attack to have remote control of those PCs , " said Eldar Turvey , the head of ScanSafe .
" We 've contacted the sites affected and tried to give them an early warning . "
The affected sites have rocketed in popularity following protests against the Chinese government in Lhasa , and at various stages of the Olympic torch relay .
A FreeTibet.org spokeswoman said campaigners were not surprised to have been attacked : " We 've been targeted in many other ways in the past , and I 'm actually surprised it 's taken this long . "
She said the site had fixed the problem after being notified of it and that no users ' computers are thought to have been infected with the malicious software .
Globalization : the goal of the global plutocracy , so they can make money everywhere , exploit everyone , sell to everyone in the world .
Globalization :
One world ruled and exploited by a small class of people .
They try to convince us it ’s a good thing even for us and sometimes it is but globalization is predicated on an abundance of cheap oil and those days are ending .
As it does and globalization become less possible , the plutocracy ( a controlling class of the wealthy ) pushes for it even harder .
They are trying desperately to squeeze every last little bit of profit out of the world before the global collapse that will come with the end of the cheap energy that sustains the world ’s huge populations .
Let ’s talk a little more about globalization .
Dell , for instance , makes computers in China and sells them in the US .
The US computer industry is gone , killed off by foreign competition , killed off with government complicity .
If the US is cut off from the rest of the world , if it is no longer economically feasible to ship computers from Asia to the US , then we will no have computers ( or TVs ) because America no longer has the factories to make its own .
The grocery store is filled with celery and onions from Mexico , grapes from Chili , and other produce from even farther away .
Where once most food came from local farms , or at most , from California and Florida , now it does n’t .
The US is no longer a net exporter of food .
We no longer produce enough food to feed our own .
When there is no more cheap gas , how will we feed ourselves ?
So globalization makes us dependent on foreign sources of food and manufactured goods .
Soon we be unable to import these goods cheaply and our own industry is gone .
When we need American industry to make things that we can no longer get globally , it wo n’t be there .
The Bush Junta and the Clinton fools , pushed by the Rockefellers and the Council on Foreign Relations , have killed off our industry in their search for cheaper labor and higher profits abroad .
We will be sorry we ca n’t get our cheap computers and cell phones from China , but we will be very , very sorry that we ca n’t get the foreign food on which we have come to depend since the deliberate destruction of much of US food production .
Without oil , what ?
Back to the days of slow and stinking steamships , their smokestacks visibly belching pollution that makes the average car look like a clean alternative ?
Or maybe we ’ll have nuclear powered ships .
Instead of oil spills like the Exxon Valdez , we ’ll get Chernobyl / Titanic disasters till the oceans are poisoned with radioactivity .
They will try everything , but in the end , without oil , globalization is n’t possible .
You ca n’t depend on foreign imports without cheap transportation .
As globalization fails each region will be forced to fall back on its local resources , its locally grown food , and its locally manufactured goods .
Will American have anything to fall back on ?
With the disappearance of cheap oil , it will become more and more difficult to support our population .
Already we have to import food and half our oil .
With the collapse of oil as a significant energy source , any country whose population exceeds its carrying capacity , i.e. , its ability to feed its population , will have famines and massive population reductions .
With the luring of up to 66 million ( the illegal immigrants and their families ) additional people to the US we are assuring that we wo n’t be able to feed or provide for our population in the post - globalization world .
It ’s like adopting ten kids when you know that in six months you will only be able to feed two of them .
By allowing immigration , by encouraging it , legal or illegal , we are blighting our future and dooming our country and our children .
We should be working to reduce US population .
Instead the plutocracy works to increase it , first by trying to end abortion and birth control , then by massive immigration .
Their ideal is China , China with its surfeit of cheap labor , China with its 1.4 billion , China with its history of famine and overpopulation and environmental degradation and its millennia of political repression .
That is where they are trying to lead us .
Because they think it is good for them .
We need leaders who will prepare us for the coming oil crunch and not just by trying to steal the oil of Iraq and Iran .
We need leaders who will help the US to become self - sufficient , and not just for energy , but for food and manufactured goods .
I think we need Al Gore .
He ’s the only candidate I see that seems to recognize the finite nature of our planet and its resources .
But with or without him I think we are due for some hard times .
I am reminded of Joseph in the Bible counciling the Pharaoh to prepare in the fat years for the coming lean ones .
This seems common prudence .
Instead we have a leadership whose motto seems to be “ Eat , drink , and be merry because tomorrow we do n’t care if you die . ”

SAN DIEGO ( Reuters ) - A large U.S. study has linked alcohol consumption to an increased risk of the most common type of breast cancer in postmenopausal women .
The analysis of data from more than 184,000 women is the biggest of three major studies to conclude that drinking raises the risk of breast cancer for older women , Jasmine Lew , a researcher at the National Cancer Institute and the study ’s lead investigator said on Sunday .
The research found that women who had one to two small drinks a day were 32 percent more likely to develop a hormone - sensitive tumor .
Three or more drinks a day raised the risk by 51 per cent .
“ Regardless of the type of alcohol , the risk was evident , ” said Lew , presenting the findings here at a meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research .
About 70 percent of women who are diagnosed with breast cancer have tumors that are positive for both the estrogen and progesterone receptors .
Lew said results from the NCI study lend credence to the theory that alcohol ’s interference with the metabolism of estrogen raises the risk of cancer .
She said it was too early to make public health recommendations but said women should talk with their doctors to assess risk factors and consider lifestyle changes .
Other studies have linked light consumption of alcoholic drinks , especially red wine , to heart protection .
Breast cancer is the second most common cancer killer of women , after lung cancer .
It will be diagnosed in 1.2 million people globally this year and will kill 500,000 .

The bird was first spotted in a wetland area
The bird is a warbler with a very long tail and slender beak and has been named the Nepal Rufous - vented Prinia .
Scientists say the bird provides an important geographical link between previously - known varieties in Pakistan and India .
But they warn its tiny population means the sub - species is endangered .
The bird was first spotted in 2005 in a wetland area .
But it is only now that taxonomists have decided it is distinctive enough to be described as a separate sub -species .
' Exciting find '
It has different dimensions from the two other types of Rufous - vented Prinia , and in colour comes between the rich chestnut of its western neighbour and the grey of the one to the east .
Hem Sagar Baral of Bird Conservation Nepal said the find is exciting because while the other two types belong to Pakistan 's Indus river basin and the Brahmaputra of north - east India , this Nepalese sub - species fills the gap .
The latest find " appears to form the link " between the two pre-existing sub - species , he said .
The new find brings the number of bird species spotted in Nepal to an exceptionally high 862 .
But the conservationists are warning that with habitat loss and degradation , the newly - identified variety is highly threatened , with at most 500 birds currently alive .
They are however elated that it has been found in a reserve which is well monitored by bird - watchers , and are now speculating that there may be more species waiting to be found - new to Nepal , or even to the world .
While visiting the American Chamber of Commerce in Russia ( in Moscow ) yesterday , President Andrew Sommers told our group a wonderful story that really captures the old Soviet - era mentality towards customer service .
When McDonald 's opened its first restaurant in the Soviet Union in 1990 near Moscow 's Pushkin Square ( pictured above , still the largest McDonald 's in the world , with 27 cash registers and seating capacity of 700 ) , it went through an extensive training program for the new workers .
Of course , customer service , which was a brand new concept for the Soviets , was extensively emphasized for the new McDonald 's employees .
After several days of training about customer service at McDonald 's , a young Soviet teenager asked the McDonald 's trainer a very serious question : " Why do we have to be so nice to the customers ?
After all , WE have the hamburgers , and they do n't ! "

I have some issues with you right now that I would like to hash out .
And now is as good a time as any with you laying over my arms while I am trying to type on the computer .
You do n't even look comfortable and you can't breathe lying like that with your butt higher up than your head but your brain is the size of a walnut so I will forgive you .
First of all , the litterbox .
Is it your goal to poop on the rim of the box ?
Because if it is , bravo !
Mission accomplished , you can stop now .
You have proved your point .
It is not funny anymore , and I have run out of sticks in the yard to clean it off with .
The box is big enough , and you are still small , so do n't even go there .
Now ... making pointless , incessant noises .
If I take something away from you because I am tired of hearing it scoot across the floor for the last 2 hours , it does not mean to go find something else to mess with .
I mean really where do you find this stuff ?
A wad of paper ?
A bottle cap ?
Is that really that fun to play with ?
I put things on the coffee table because I want them there .
I do not want you to knock EVERYTHING off of the coffee table in one of your mindless " tearing ass through the house for no reason " adventures every single day .
Once in a while , it is amusing .
Every day , it 's not that funny .
Your ass stinks .
I mean REALLY stinks .
Like the worst poop you 've ever smelled .
Why do you smell soooo horrible ?
I thought cats were clean !
I have never experienced this smelly , stinky cat phenomena with any other cat on this Earth .
Why , God , did you give me the most stinky cat in this solar system ?
And Cat , why do you insist on showing me your ass ?
I know it stinks , but what am I supposed to do about it ?
Bathe you ???
LOL !
Remember the last time that happened ?
I still have the scars ...
Also , when you sit on my arm , please have the kindness to put your tail over your butthole so it does n't come into contact with my skin .
I might catch something .
Lastly , I am allergic to you .
I know this is n't your fault , but knowing this , why do you insist on rubbing the whole length of your body on my face ?
Okay ...
I just pulled a CATHAIR out of my eye .
No wonder my eyes are itchy if you are purposefully depositing your dander into my eyes !
What are you trying to prove here ?
That you know I 'm stuck with you ?
While you 're busy carrying things about the house in your mouth to deposit them into some area that I have n't discovered yet - would you mind bringing me a peice of sandpaper to me so that I can alleviate the itching you 've caused me ?
Oh - while we 're on this subject , I need my hair ties back - I know you have them .
Thanks .
Last month , a delegate from Galveston County , Texas presented a proposal to the Republican National Convention to revoke tax exempt status for the Church of Scientology .
Here is the Resolution :
The Resolution
Initiative for Texas Resolution Calling for the revocation of the Church of Scientology ’s status as a Legitimate religion in the sate of Texas .
Be it resolved that the Church of Scientology in the state of Texas no longer be recognized as an official religion , thus revoking its religious tax exempt status in the state of Texas .
In order to preserve Scientology ’s religious tax exempt status in the state of Texas an organization must meet objectives in order to qualify .
They are listed in the following statements :
1. ) The organization must have an official statement of Faith .
The church of Scientology has no such statement .
2. ) The organization must have some form of routine worship service .
The church of Scientology has no such routine .
3. ) Church services must be open and freely available to the public .
The church of Scientology requires its members to pay an amount equal to or greater than 15,000 U S dollars and to be subjugated to months of mind altering auditing sessions in order for a member to obtain the information regarding the teachings of Scientology .
Members who complete these courses are forced to sign agreements not to inform either unpaid / unaudited members or the general public of the teachings of Scientology .
Be it resolved that the church of Scientology in the state of Texas be officially regarded as a business and not as a religion .
Resolution adopted this twenty - ninth day of March , 2008 , at the Precinct Convention of Precinct Number 341 , and / or senatorial district 11 Convention , Galveston County , Texas of the Republican Party of Texas .
Hmm .
This is certainly an interesting development as the Church of Scientology has had its share of battles with the IRS over the years regarding tax exempt status .
In 1993 , the Church of Scientology paid the feds $ 12.5 million as part of a settlement to obtain tax - exempt status .
The details of the settlement have not been made public but reportedly included a special “ church tax - compliance committee ” and an agreement not to sue the IRS for pre-1993 claims .
The Church has been in existence since the 1950s and was established by author L. Ron Hubbard .
The Church claims membership of between 8 and 15 million people worldwide .
Famous Scientologists include Tom Cruise , Katie Holmes , Lisa Marie Presley , Kirstie Alley , Leah Remini , Beck and John Travolta – Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes actively promote the Church .
The IRS had previously denied status to the Church on the grounds that the Church was a “ for profit ” business – countries such as Germany have continued to deny tax - exempt status to the Church for similar reasons .
The church reacted with a barrage of lawsuits .
It will indeed be interesting to see if , in the event that Texas was to make this resolution the law , a similar end would happen in Texas .
What do you think will happen ?

President Bush , Cheney should be impeached
It ’s been five years since this corrupt and irresponsible administration has set its well - documented , years - old global domination plans into motion by attacking and occupying Iraq .
In doing so , it has lied to the American people , lied to Congress , lied to the United Nations and lied to the world .
It has displayed the most egregious degree of cronyism in history and lined the pockets of favored members of the military industrial complex with billions of dollars in blood money .
Meanwhile , it has played on the fears and the patriotism of ordinary Americans , blinding them with false information , intimidating truth tellers and dismantling the very basis of what defines this country “ “ our Constitution .
The administration is in league with countries that have terrorist sympathies , nuclear weapons and serious human rights violations .
There are more impeachable offenses to list than space permits .
We all know what they are .
What are we going to do about it ?
Our “ representatives ” have not acted on our behalf .
Government of , by and for the people has been erased by a flawed system that has allowed power and money to circumvent the checks and balances so brilliantly devised by our founding fathers .
I urge every reader of this letter to contact our elected representatives , Rep. Carol Shea - Porter ( 1-202-225-5456 ) and Rep. Paul Hodes ( 1-202-225-5206 ) , as well as Speaker of the House Nancy “ off the table ” Pelosi ( [ email protected ] ) , and ask them to do what they were elected to do , what they are bound to do by their oath of office : impeach President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney
More locally , impeachment resolution HR 24 is expected to go to the floor of the New Hampshire House of Representatives this month .
Show your support for this wakeup call to the U.S. House sponsored by Rep. Betty Hall , D - Brookline , by e-mailing your thoughts to [ email protected ]
Your tangible expression including name and city will be submitted to the Legislature for consideration .
The text of the bill can be found at www .
gencourt.state.nh.us/legislation/2008/ hr0024.html .
At the very least , read the bill .
Either there is a tremendous lack of awareness or a frightening level of apathy going on in this country due to shell shock , distraction or a feeling of powerlessness .
Despite the complicit press , we have all known more than enough to demand impeachment for a very long time .
If we do not act , the damage will be irreparable .
If we do , perhaps we can restore our national pride and global reputation by shouting loudly and clearly that we do not stand for these kinds of lies , crimes and aggression , but rather that we reconfirm our country ’s foundation and our commitment to the spirit of individual human rights and freedoms guaranteed by our founders through their intended prohibition of these abuses of power .
Are we a nation of sheep or of patriots ?
Do n’t be a lemming .
Make your voice heard .

Gordon Brown is preparing to override the views of his own expert advisers and tighten the law on cannabis .
Downing Street made it clear yesterday that the Prime Minister is determined to upgrade cannabis from a class C to a class B substance with a maximum jail sentence of five years for possession .
But opposition parties claimed the Government 's drugs policy was in chaos after it emerged that Mr Brown would ignore the conclusion of the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs that cannabis should remain a class C substance .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
It will be the first time for 30 years that a prime minister has disregarded the recommendations of the body set up to advise ministers on drugs legislation .
The advisory council was instructed in the summer to review the legislation on cannabis after alarm that super - strong varieties were becoming more popular and that cannabis was linked to schizophrenia .
Mr Brown signalled then that he wanted the controls toughened , but faces embarrassment after the drugs experts and scientists reached the opposite conclusion .
It is understood to have agreed that a link between heavy cannabis use and mental illness could not be proved and to have dismissed suggestions that the downgrading of the drug to a class C substance four years ago sent a confusing message to the public .
Only a handful of advisory council members backed restoring cannabis to class B .
Mr Brown 's spokesman attempted to play down the decision , insisting the advisory council would not submit its final report until the end of the month .
But he confirmed that the Prime Minister did not feel automatically bound by its recommendations : " [ Mr Brown ] did say he would take advice and look at what they say . "
Whitehall sources said Mr Brown was ready to overrule the council .
They pointed to his words at a press conference this week when he said he did not want to send any signal that would encourage drug use .
One said : " He has a strong view about it . "
Harriet Harman , the deputy Labour leader , told MPs : " There is new evidence of its dangerousness because a much stronger version of cannabis is being used , with much greater dangers .
And there is new evidence of the risk of psychosis caused by cannabis . "
The drug was downgraded from class B to class C by David Blunkett , when he was Home Secretary , in January 2004 in a move to enable police to concentrate on tackling hard drugs such as heroin and cocaine .

Although cannabis use remains a criminal offence , police have in practice tended to confiscate the drug and issue a caution rather than prosecute the users .
Use of the drug among young adults has fallen in the past five years , suggesting downgrading has not encouraged them to experiment .
However , " skunk " – said to be two - and - a - half times stronger than traditional cannabis resin – now accounts for about three - quarters of the British market for the drug , compared with 15 per cent in 2002 .
The advisory council was told at a recent public hearing that users were smoking less of the drug because of its increased potency .
David Cameron , the Conservative leader , who supports the reclassification of cannabis , said : " People have had enough of reviews and the Prime Minister should stop dithering and get on and make a decision . "
Chris Huhne , the Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman , said : " Ministers should stop playing politics with drugs judgments and listen to the advice of the medical experts . "
Roger Howard , chief executive of the independent UK Drug Policy Commission , said decisions on drugs legislation should be handed to an independent body that would examine the scientific evidence .
He said : " In recent years the process has become muddied by politics . "
The Association of Chief Police Officers has called for reclassification , despite having backed the original decision to downgrade .
* The number of drug users and alcoholics claiming incapacity benefits has more than doubled in the past 10 years .
More than 100,000 addicts are now claiming a maximum of £ 87.50 per week .
The number claiming the benefit while abusing drugs has risen from 21,900 in 1997 to 49,890 last year .
The Tories claimed the payments total about £ 400 m a year .

Simon Pegg , one of the brightest stars of British comedy , has denounced as ' a flagrant snub ' a decision to exclude him from an American version of his hit sitcom Spaced .
Pegg , who co-wrote and starred in the cult Channel 4 programme , says the fact that neither he , co-creator Jessica Hynes , nor director Edgar Wright were consulted was 'an effective vote of no confidence in the very people who created the show ' .
The comic actor is now well known in the United States for starring in the zombie romantic comedy Shaun of the Dead , which he also co-wrote , and is angry that the producers are using his name in publicity material to promote the pilot without his permission .
He says the behaviour of those involved in the deal for the remake - Granada , Wonderland and Warner Brothers - displays ' a sheer lack of respect ' in 'respectively selling out and appropriating our ideas without even letting us know ' .
As shooting starts on the new version of the show , first broadcast between 1999 and 2001 , he claimed that none of the original creators had been consulted .
The pilot for the new sitcom is being made for the Fox network and one of the executive producers is Joseph McGinty Nichol , known as McG , director of the Charlie 's Angels movies and of the forthcoming Terminator 4 .
Pegg has stressed that he does not object to US adaptations in principle .
Rights to the show were sold by Granada America to Wonderland Sound and Vision and Warner Bros TV and Pegg acknowledges he has no legal right to involvement in the project , but says he , Hynes and Wright are all annoyed to be left out .
His success in Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz , both directed by Wright , have won the actor wide recognition in America and he is about to star with Kirsten Dunst in an adaptation of Toby Young 's memoir How to Lose Friends and Alienate People .
Pegg is particularly annoyed that press releases for the new sitcom have used his name alongside Wright 's to boost its profile .
Fans of the original show , including a sizeable US contingent , have expressed dismay at the prospect of a bland new treatment , and both Wright and Hynes have criticised the planned sitcom .
On his website Wright says he does not want to be associated with it .
' That show was very personal to us .
It 's about Simon and Jessica , not just some format or high concept , ' he writes .
The director goes on to reveal he has ' a terrible recurring dream of being burgled in broad daylight ( no joke , and no dream analyst required ) ' .
Referring to Variety magazine 's summary of the show ' Single - cam half - hour revolves around a young man and woman who pose as a couple in order to rent a cheap apartment ' , he adds : ' It pains me to see it reduced to this . '
Hynes , known as Jessica Stevenson when Spaced was made , has used her blog to warn American viewers not to watch it .
She also makes the suggestion that there should be a British remake of McG's hit Charlie 's Angels called Charlie 's Angles ' about three female architects who love to design buildings , make biscuits and wear button - up cardigans ' .
When she first heard about the new sitcom , she claims she approached the American producers ' in a very English way , wondering if , you know , I 'd been in the garden when they called ' .
Josh Lawson , a young Australian described by Fox as ' Matthew Perry meets Robin Williams ' , has been cast in Pegg 's role of Tim , renamed Ben and , according to an early review of the pilot script on the website Collider.com , it closely follows the first British episode .
The pilot for NBC 's version of the BBC sitcom The Office was also close to its UK counterpart , but developed a distinct voice .
It remains a critical and ratings success .
The British show 's creators , Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant , were heavily involved in the development of the US version .
The central joke in Spaced was the use of overblown , American film clichés to tell the banal story of life in a north London flat share .
It now seems that Hollywood is to have the last laugh .
WEST SALEM , Ill . --
Residents across the Midwest were awakened Friday by a 5.2 magnitude earthquake that rattled skyscrapers in Chicago 's Loop and homes in Cincinnati but appeared to cause no major injuries or damage .
The quake just before 4:37 a.m. was centered six miles from West Salem , Ill. , and 45 miles from Evansville , Ind .
It was felt in such distant cities as Milwaukee , Des Moines , Iowa , and Atlanta , nearly 400 miles to the southeast .

There 's little doubt that anyone with the time and the inclination can overhaul at least a few Wikipedia entries to suit their personal ambitions .
All they need is the right friends .
Or a little pillow talk .
The question is , could someone overhaul the entire encyclopedia ?
Over the past two years , one man has donated or " lined up " donations totaling more than $ 1.35 m to the charitable organization that runs Wikipedia , dwarfing the contributions of any other donor .
And this man is among Silicon Valley 's most conspicuous venture capitalists .
His name is Roger McNamee , and he runs Elevation Partners , a San Francisco - based VC firm whose partners include Bono , the U2 frontman more famous for pop records than venture capital .
In fact , Bono played a significant role in the mysterious pas de deux between Elevation and the Wikimedia Foundation , making nice with Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy " Jimbo " Wales and his wife Christine before a U2 concert in Mexico City more than two years ago .
In the beginning , McNamee 's donations were made anonymously - at least on official records .
But the Elevation Partners connection has long been an open secret among Wikimedia insiders , and last week the secret spilled out onto the web when former Foundation executive Danny Wool posted a few details to his well - read blog .
After Jimmy
Wales dumped his lover on the " free encyclopedia anyone can edit " , and Danny Wool accused the site 's Spiritual Leader of mismanaging Foundation funds , many assumed that the The Great Wikipedia Soap Opera had reached its climax .
But there 's more to come .
At the very least , McNamee 's involvement with Wikimedia is a puzzle that needs solving .
Considering the Foundation 's status as a tax - exempt non-profit , a VC would need more than a little sleight of hand to turn it into a personal moneymaker .
And if he did , this would surely raise the ire of more than few Wikipedians .
Remember : Wikipedia was built almost entirely with free labor .
When Bono met Jimbo
According to Danny Wool , Elevation Partners - named for the U2 song - first approached the Wikimedia Foundation in late 2005 .
Wool took a phone call from a partner named Marc Bodnick .
" There was a period of time where everybody was trying to get in on the Wikipedia action , " Wool told us .
" Bodnick was really intriguing .
He gave me the whole Bono thing , and I thought that was really cool .
So I told Jimmy . "
Wales soon met with Bodnick at Wikimedia 's St Petersburg , Florida , headquarters , and later chatted with Roger McNamee in San Francisco .
Then , several weeks later , Wales and his wife Christine had dinner with Bodnick and his personal assistant at a steakhouse in nearby Tampa .
According to Wool , this was the $ 1,300 meal that Wales famously asked the Foundation to pay for .
In the end , the Foundation did not reimburse Wales for the steakhouse tab .
But a few weeks later , on February 15 , 2006 , Wales and his wife flew to Mexico for that U2 concert , together with Danny Wool and another Wikimedia staffer .
And this tab was on Elevation .
" They paid for all the expenses , " Wool told us .
" All of them . "
That night , the four of them joined Bono for drinks on the roof of their hotel , and at one point the pop icon suggested that Wales dump Wikipedia 's volunteer editors and hire professionals .
Bono also suggested the Wikimedia foursome meet him for lunch the next afternoon before attending the concert .
But in the end , that meeting included only Wales and his wife .
" I was all dressed for the lunch with Bono and I was told that Bono only wanted to meet with Jimmy and Christine , " Wool said .
BAGHDAD ( Reuters ) - A British journalist held for two months by kidnappers in the southern Iraqi city of Basra was rescued on Monday by Iraqi forces sweeping through the city in a crackdown on militants , the Iraqi military said .
Richard Butler , a photographer working for the U.S. network CBS , appeared in good health and high spirits after his release .
Unknown militants had seized him and his interpreter from their hotel in Basra , freeing the interpreter a few days later .
“ The Iraqi army stormed the house and overcame my guards and then burst through the door , ” said Butler , smiling broadly and surrounded by Iraqi officials on Iraqiya state television .
“ I had my hood on , which I had to have on all the time .
And they shouted something at me and I pulled my hood off . ”
In northern Iraq , a suicide attack and two car bombs killed 18 people .
Among the dead were 12 members of Iraq ’s Kurdish Peshmerga security force who were in a truck near the Syrian border when a car bomb exploded as they passed by , police said .
An explosion in central Baghdad ’s Tayaran Square killed five people and wounded nine , police said , while a roadside bomb attack on a U.S. patrol set a market ablaze .
CBS welcomed Butler ’s release .
“ We are incredibly grateful that our colleague , Richard Butler , has been released and is safe , ” the network said in a statement .
Lieutenant - General Mohan al - Furaiji , commander of Iraqi armed forces in Basra , said a special team had been set up to search for a policeman suspected of being behind the kidnapping .
Furaiji , who was shown smiling widely on television with his arm on the freed photographer ’s shoulder , told reporters Iraqi forces searching for weapons had stumbled upon Butler when they entered a house in Basra ’s central Jbela district .
“ We were suspicious about a house with a guard standing outside .
We arrested the guard , entered the house and found the British journalist handcuffed and hooded , ” Furaiji said .
Elements of Iraq ’s police force are often accused of cooperating with militants .
But the rescue was a triumph for Iraqi security forces , embarrassed last month by a hasty crackdown on gunmen in Basra that sparked fighting across the south and Baghdad while failing to dislodge masked Mehdi Army militiamen from the streets .

HOUSE AROUSED SUSPICION
The kidnapping of Butler , one of the few Westerners who dared venture out in Basra without a military convoy , was a symbol of the rampant lawlessness in a city that controls Iraq ’s only port and 80 percent of its oil revenue .
The Committee to Protect Journalists says 51 journalists have been kidnapped in Iraq since 2004 , with 12 of those killed .
It has called the war “ the deadliest conflict for journalists in recent history , ” with a total of 127 journalists and 50 media support workers killed since 2003 .

The news of Butler ’s release came after a night of renewed clashes in Baghdad ’s Sadr City slum , the scene of intense street battles over the past three weeks between security forces and the Mehdi Army of Shi’ite cleric Moqtada al - Sadr .
The fighting has been more intense than at any time since the first half of 2007 , thrusting the Iraq conflict back onto centre stage of the U.S. presidential contest .
In Baghdad , U.S. forces said they had killed six gunmen in an overnight battle in Sadr City , firing from M1 tanks and helicopters at fighters using rocket - propelled grenades .
“ We heard the sound of bombing and clashes after midnight .
It lasted for around an hour and then stopped .
American planes were hovering in the sky until morning , ” said grocer Ali Sittar .
A senior U.S. military official who requested anonymity said Apache helicopters and drone aircraft were “ loitering ” around the clock above Sadr City , hunting militants who have fired rockets at the Green Zone government and diplomatic compound .
In the slum , angry mourners carried a coffin containing the body of a man killed in clashes through the streets .
U.S. commanders have criticised the planning of the March crackdown in Basra , led personally by Shi’ite Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki .
The Iraqi government has sacked 1,300 soldiers and police involved in the operation for failing to fight .
In a statement , Sadr urged the government to reverse the decision , saying those who refused to fight had only been following orders from Shi’ite religious leaders .

Reading between the sheets , the world of “ Kristen ” and Eliot Spitzer may seem relatively benign .
She may have been abused as a child , and tangled with drugs and homelessness , but she was also a consenting adult who apparently kept half the cash that customers paid for her .
That ’s a dangerously unrepresentative glimpse of prostitution in America .
Those who work with street prostitutes say that what they see daily is pimps who control teenage girls with violence and threats  plus an emotional bond  and then keep every penny the girl is paid .
“ Sometimes I meet a girl who says , ‘ I have a really good pimp  he beats me only with an open hand , ’ ” said Rachel Lloyd , a former prostitute who runs a program for underage prostitutes in New York City .
“ Many of the girls see the pimps as boyfriends , but violence is integral to everything that happens in the sex industry .
That ’s how you get punished for not bringing in your quota for that evening , or for looking your pimp in the eye . ”
Bradley Myles , who works in Washington for an antitrafficking organization called Polaris Project , says it is astonishing how similar the business model is for pimping across the country .
Pimps crush runaway girls with a mix of violence and affection , degradation and gifts , and then require absolute obedience to a rigid code : the girl cannot look the pimp in the eye , call him by his name , or keep any cash .
The “ Success ” Mantra in Iraq
The other day , as we reached the first anniversary of the President ’s announcement of his “ surge ” strategy , his “ new way forward ” in Iraq , I found myself thinking about the earliest paid book - editing work I ever did .
An editor at a San Francisco textbook publisher hired me to “ doctor ” god-awful texts designed for audiences of captive kids .
Each of these “ books ” was not only in a woeful state of disrepair , but essentially D.O.A .
I was nonetheless supposed to do a lively rewrite of the mess and add seductive “ sidebars ” ; another technician then simplified the language to “ grade level ” and a designer provided a flashy layout and look .
Zap !
Pow !
Kebang !
During the years that I freelanced for that company in the early 1970s , an image of what I was doing formed in my mind — and it suddenly came back to me this week .
I used to describe it this way :
The little group of us — rewriter , grade - level reducer , designer — would be summoned to the publisher ’s office .
There , our brave band of technicians would be ushered into a room in which there would be nothing but a gurney with a corpse on it in a state of advanced decomposition .
The publisher ’s representative would then issue a simple request :
Make it look like it can get up and walk away .
And the truth was : that corpse of a book would be almost lifelike when we were done with it , but one thing was guaranteed — it would never actually get up and walk away .
That was in another century and a minor matter of bad books that no one wanted to call by their rightful name .
But that image came to mind again more than three decades later because it ’s hard not to think of America ’s Iraq in similar terms .
Only this week , Abdul Qadir , the Iraqi defense minister , announced that “ his nation would not be able to take full responsibility for its internal security until 2012 , nor be able on its own to defend Iraq ’s borders from external threat until at least 2018 . ”
Pentagon officials , reported Thom Shanker of the New York Times , expressed no surprise at these dismal post - surge projections , although they were “ even less optimistic than those [ Qadir ] made last year . ”
According to this guesstimate then , the U.S. military occupation of Iraq wo n’t end for , minimally , another ten years .
President Bush confirmed this on his recent Mideast jaunt when , in response to a journalist ’s question , he said that the U.S. stay in Iraq “ could easily be ” another decade or more .
Folks , our media may be filled with discussions about just how “ successful ” the President ’s surge plan has been , but really , Iraq is the corpse in the room .
“ Success ” as a Mantra Last January , after announcing his “ surge strategy , ” the President called in his technicians .
As it turned out , Gen. David Petraeus , surge commander in Iraq , has been quite impressive , as has new U.S. ambassador to that country , Ryan Crocker .
Think of them as “ the undertakers , ” since they ’ve been the ones who , applying their skills , have managed to give that Iraqi corpse the faint glow of life .
The President asked them to make Iraq look like it could get up and walk away — and the last year of “ success , ” widely trumpeted in the media , has been the result .
But just think about what the defense minister and President Bush are promising :
By 2018 , the country will — supposedly — be able to control its own borders , one of the more basic acts of a sovereign state .
That , by itself , tells you much of what you need to be know .
In order to achieve an image of lifelike quiescence in Iraq , involving a radical lowering of “ violence ” in that country , the general and ambassador did have to give up the ghost on a number of previous Bush administration passions .
Rebellious al - Anbar Province was , for instance , essentially turned over to members of the community ( many of whom had , even according to the Department of Defense , been fighting Americans until recently ) .
They were then armed and paid by the U.S. not to make too much trouble .
In the Iraqi capital , on the other hand , the surging American military looked the other way as , in the first half of 2007 , the Shiite “ cleansing ” of mixed Baghdad neighborhoods reached new heights , transforming it into a largely Shiite city .
This may have been the real “ surge ” in Iraq and , if you look at new maps of the ethnic make - up of the capital , you can see the startling results — from which a certain quiescence followed .
Powerful Shiite cleric Muqtada al - Sadr , a longtime opponent of the Bush administration , called a “ truce ” during the surge months and went about purging and reorganizing his powerful militia , the Mahdi Army .
In exchange , the U.S. has given up , at least temporarily , its goal of wresting control of some of those neighborhoods from the Sadrists .
Despite hailing the recent passage of what might be called a modest re-Baathification law in the Iraqi Parliament ( that may have little effect on actual government employment ) , the administration has also reportedly given up in large part on pushing its highly touted “ benchmarks ” for the Iraqis to accomplish .
This was to be a crucial part of Iraqi political “ reconciliation ” ( once described as the key to the success of the whole surge strategy ) .
It has now been dumped for so - called Iraqi solutions .
All of this , including the lack of U.S. patrolling in al - Anbar province , the heartland of the Sunni insurgency , plus the addition of almost 30,000 troops in Baghdad and environs , has indeed given Iraq a quieter look — especially in the United States , where Iraqi news has largely disappeared from front pages and slipped deep into prime - time TV news coverage just as the presidential campaign of 2008 heats up .
The surge was always , in a sense , a gamble for time , a pacification program directed at the “ home front ” in the President ’s Global War on Terror as well as at Iraq itself .
And if this is what you mean by “ success ” in Iraq , Bush has indeed succeeded admirably .
As in the Vietnam era , when President Richard Nixon began “ Vietnamizing ” that war , a reduction of American casualties has had the effect of turning media attention elsewhere .
So another year has now passed in a country that we plunged into an unimaginable charnel - house state .
Whether civilian dead between the invasion of 2003 and mid-2006 ( before the worst year of civil - war level violence even hit ) was in the range of 600,000 as a study in the British medical journal , The Lancet reported or 150,000 as a recent World Health Organization study suggests , whether two million or 2.5 million Iraqis have fled the country , whether 1.1 million or more than two million have been displaced internally , whether electricity blackouts and water shortages have marginally increased or decreased , whether the country ’s health - care system is beyond resuscitation or could still be revived , whether Iraqi oil production has nearly crept back to the low point of the Saddam Hussein - era or not , whether fields of opium poppies are , for the first time , spreading across the country ’s agricultural lands or still relatively localized , Iraq is a continuing disaster zone on a catastrophic scale hard to match in recent memory .
What Bush has done with his surge , however , is buy himself that year - plus of free time , while he negotiates with Iraq ’s inside - the - Green - Zone government to cement in place an endless American presence there .
In the process , he may create a sense of permanency that no future president will prove capable of tampering with — not without being known as the man ( or woman ) who “ lost ” Iraq .
Forget the Republican presidential candidates — Sen. John McCain , for instance , has said that he does n’t care if the U.S. is in Iraq for the next hundred years — and think about the leading Democratic candidates with their elongated ( and partial ) “ withdrawal ” plans .
Barack Obama , for instance , is for guaranteeing a 16 - month withdrawal schedule , and that ’s just for U.S. “ combat troops , ” which are only perhaps half of all American forces in the country .
Hillary Clinton ’s plan is no more promising .
The President ’s gamble , so far “ successful , ” has been that the look of returning life in Iraq will last at least long enough for him to turn a marginally “ successful ” war over to the next administration .
If the Democrats sweep to power , he hopes to stick them with that war .
As Michael Hirsh of Newsweek put the matter recently , while discussing the President ’s trip to the Middle East : “ Far away in the Persian Gulf , Bush is creating facts on the ground that the next president may not be able to ignore . ”
( Of course , this assumes that the Iraqis will comply . )
In that case , here would be another piece of potential Bush “ success ” :
Nine months into any new presidential term and the Iraq War is yours .
( Those of us old enough to remember have already lived through this scenario once with “ Lyndon Johnson ’s war ” in Vietnam , so how does “ Barack Obama ’s war ” sound ? )
Then , former Bush administration officials , Republicans of all stripes , neocons , and an array of pundits will turn on those uncelebratory Democrats who , they will claim , managed to snatch defeat from the jaws of “ success , ” if not victory .
Wait for it .
Victory Laps and Other Celebrations
But folks , let ’s face it , despite the cosmetic acts of the President and his undertakers , America ’s Iraq is still a corpse .
And yet , in this “ post - surge ” moment , everybody is arguing over just how “ successful ” the surge has been .
All agree it has “ lowered violence ” in Iraq .
The Democrats insist that the plan ’s “ success ” is limited indeed , because its main goal , “ political reconciliation , ” has not been reached .
On the other hand , Republicans , assorted neocons , and some in the administration are already doing modest victory dances .
The newest New York Times columnist , William Kristol , a man previously known for being endlessly wrong on his Iraqi war of choice , just last week chided the Democrats in his typical way : “ It ’s apparently impermissible for leading Democrats to acknowledge — let alone celebrate — progress in Iraq . ”
Let the celebrations begin !
In the White House , anyway .
After all , whatever Iraq news breaks out of the inside pages of the paper is now often framed by this ongoing dispute about the how much surge and post - surge success has happened , about how much to celebrate , and that is another sign of success for the President .
No wonder , as Michael Abramowitz of the Washington Post put it , Bush ’s recent meeting in Kuwait with Gen. Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker , as well as his comments to a rally of 3,000 hoo-ahing U.S. troops , “ had the air of a victory lap for a president whose decision to raise the troop levels in Iraq last year was questioned not only by Democrats but also by many Republicans and even generals at the Pentagon . ”
But folks , George W. Bush can lap the Middle East , the planet , the solar system and America ’s Iraq is still never going to get up and walk away .
Not even in 2018 or 2028 .
Do n’t forget , it ’s a corpse .
( In fact , unlike the politicians and the media , recent opinion polls show that the American people generally have not forgotten this . )
In the meantime , the military in Iraq is preparing for something other than a simple victory lap , just in case the President ’s surge luck does n’t quite extend to 2009 .
Former brigadier general and Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Middle Eastern Affairs Mark Kimmitt , for instance , recently suggested that there was “ only a mild chance ” that surge security gains would prove permanent : “ [ I ] f I had to put a number to it , maybe it ’s three in 10 , maybe it ’s 50 - 50 , if we play our cards right . ”
In fact , General Petraeus and the rest of the U.S. military are faced with a relatively simple calculus for their exhausted , overstretched , overused forces among whom the rate of post - traumatic stress syndrome has tripled .
Although the President recently insisted that he would be happy to slow down or halt an expected drawdown of 30,000 surge troops by July , the fact is that present military manpower levels there are literally unsustainable — especially since 3,200 Marines are now being committed to the ever less successful Afghan War .
Drawdowns are a must and “ successful ” Iraq , already experiencing signs of another uptick in violence and death ( including of American troops ) in the new year , is likely to need a dose of something else soon , if that faint glow of life is to be sustained .
One candidate for that , as American troop levels drop , is air power , a much underreported subject in both Iraq and Afghanistan .
In Iraq , according to a recent study by the Center for Strategic and International Studies , the use of air power took a striking leap forward in 2007 .
According to the study , the number of Close Air Support / Precision Strikes — sorties that used a major munition — in Iraq went up five - fold between 2006 and 2007 ( not including December of that year ) , from 229 to 1,119 or , on average , from 19 per month to 102 per month .
2008 started with a literal bang , 40,000 pounds of explosives were dropped in ten minutes on 38 targets in a Sunni farming area on “ the outskirts ” of Baghdad .
After 10 preceding days of intermittent air attacks , this was probably the largest display of air power since the 2003 invasion .
It was also undoubtedly a harbinger of things to come and , of course , guaranteed to drive up the number of civilian dead .
Similarly , between January and October 2007 , according to the Associated Press , the U.S. military more than doubled its use of armed and unarmed drone aircraft , which clocked 500,000 - plus hours in the air ( mainly in Iraq ) .
This is undoubtedly a taste of what “ success ” means in the year to come .
Dancing on a Corpse So , here ’s a simple reality check :
The whole discussion of , and argument about , “ success ” in Iraq is , in fact , obscene .
Given what has already happened to that country — and will continue to happen as long as the U.S. remains an occupying power there — the very category of “ success ” is an obscenity .
If violence actually does stay down there , that may be a modest godsend for Iraqis , but it can hardly be considered a sign of American “ success . ”
Every now and then , history comes in handy .
In a previous moment , when the neocons and their allied pundits were feeling particularly triumphant , they began touting Bush ’s America as the planet ’s new Rome ( only more so ) .
That talk evaporated once Iraq went into full - scale insurgency mode ( and Afghanistan followed ) .
But perhaps
Rome does remain a touchstone of a sort for administration Iraqi policies .
What comes to mind is the Roman historian Tacitus ’ description of the Roman way of war .
He put his version of it into the mouth of Calgacus , a British chieftain who opposed the Romans , and it went , in part , like this : “ They have plundered the world , stripping naked the land in their hunger , they loot even the ocean : they are driven by greed , if their enemy be rich ; by ambition , if poor ; neither the wealth of the east nor the west can satisfy them : they are the only people who behold wealth and indigence with equal passion to dominate .
They ravage , they slaughter , they seize by false pretenses , and all of this they hail as the construction of empire .

Bug tracking software ?
Who needs it !
I was confident in my ability to maintain several Outlook folders of bug reports , flagging completed ones ' orange ' — or was it ' green ' that meant done ?
No , wait , I think it was purple .
My system was perfect .
Then Alex came along and ruined it all .
I can't pinpoint exactly when I started regularly using the bug tracking software that he liked , but it may 've had something to do with being held at gunpoint .
You probably thought Alex was kidding in that article .
" You do n't have a choice in this .
Use the software , " Alex suggested .
After the threat encounter training session with Alex , I called my loved ones , then started copying the unresolved bugs ( yellow flags ) from my Outlook manual bug tracking system .
Wait , crap , blue flags .
I guess what I 'm trying to say is that change — such as introducing a bug tracking system — is gradual .
Byron 's team had reluctantly installed and began using Bugzilla , which ironically appeared to be full of bugs .
His team would report updating and resolving issues , but these updates were not appearing in the system .
" I do n't know what you 're talking about , I definitely , absolutely updated it , " a coworker insisted .
" I have no idea why you 're not seeing the updates .
Are you sure you 're looking in the right folder ? "
Byron stifled a scoff , thinking Folder ?
Bugzilla does n't sort issues by folders — it sorts by product , component , and other categories .
Worse , the issue seemed to affect everyone but Byron .
His issues would remain closed when he closed them , and issues he edited would always retain the updates .
In fact , Byron had yet to see even a single error screen in Bugzilla .
Eventually , Byron asked his colleague to walk him through the process of updating an issue .
" Great timing , I just did a checkin .
Let 's go . "
Let 's go ?
Byron thought .
Byron 's coworker led him to a storage room lined with file cabinets .
After flipping through a few folders , he found what he was after and started writing on it .
While Bugzilla has a pretty impressive feature list , sadly " reading and scanning physical sheets of paper in a file cabinet to update issues " is n't one of them .
A new and virulent wheat fungus , previously found in East Africa and Yemen , has moved to major wheat growing areas in Iran , reports the UN's Food and Agricultural Organization .
The fungus is capable of wreaking havoc to wheat production by destroying entire fields .
Countries east of Iran , like Afghanistan , India , Pakistan , Turkmenistan , Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan , all major wheat producers , are most threatened by the fungus and should be on high alert , FAO said .
It is estimated that as much as 80 percent of all wheat varieties planted in Asia and Africa are susceptible to the wheat stem rust ( Puccinia graminis ) .
The spores of wheat rust are mostly carried by wind over long distances and across continents .
“ The detection of the wheat rust fungus in Iran is very worrisome , ” said Shivaji Pandey , Director of FAO ’s Plant Production and Protection Division .
“ The fungus is spreading rapidly and could seriously lower wheat production in countries at direct risk .
Affected countries and the international community have to ensure that the spread of the disease gets under control in order to reduce the risk to countries that are already hit by high food prices . ”
The government of the Islamic Republic of Iran has informed FAO that the fungus has been detected in some localities in Broujerd and Hamedan in western Iran .
Laboratory tests have confirmed the presence of the fungus .
Iran said it will enhance its research capacity to face the new infection and develop new wheat varieties resistant to the disease .
Ug99
The wheat fungus first emerged in Uganda in 1999 and is therefore called Ug99 .
The wind - borne transboundary pest subsequently spread to Kenya and Ethiopia .
In 2007 , an FAO mission confirmed for the first time that Ug99 has affected wheat fields in Yemen .
The Ug99 strain found in Yemen was already more virulent than the one found in East Africa .
Ethiopia and Kenya had serious wheat rust epidemics in 2007 with considerable yield losses .
The Borlaug Global Rust Initiative ( BGRI ) , established to combat wheat rusts around the world , will support countries in developing resistant varieties , producing their clean quality seeds , upgrading national plant protection and plant breeding services and developing contingency plans .
The BGRI was founded by Norman Borlaug ( known as " the father of the Green Revolution " ) , Cornell University , the International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry areas ( ICARDA ) , the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center ( CIMMYT ) and FAO .
Disease surveillance and wheat breeding is already underway to monitor the fungus and to develop Ug99 resistant varieties .
However , more efforts are required to develop long term durable resistant varieties that can be made available to farmers in affected countries and countries at risk .
FAO urged countries to increase disease surveillance and intensify efforts to control the disease .
Given the comparative lack of dialogue , pornographers and triple - X movie stars of the San Fernando Valley have been unaffected by the screenwriters ' strike crippling Hollywood 's movie industry .
But that does not mean all is going smoothly .
America 's adult entertainment workers claim their $ 13bn industry is in trouble .
Sales are down by as much as half as customers learn that what they once paid for can now be free .
Pirated pornography is flooding the internet while thousands of ' amateurs ' post their activities on websites such as YouPorn .
Last week , Vivid Video , one of the largest porn studios , took legal action against Pornotube , a website the company claims is depriving the industry and its performers of legitimate revenue by allowing the streaming of copyrighted material .
According to surveys , sites such as YouPorn and Pornotube draw more internet traffic than CNN .
Like YouTube , the phenomenally popular , Google - owned website , X - rated sites depend on users streaming videos to the site - and YouPorn is adding 15 million new users a month .
' The adult entertainment industry is starting to get aggressive , ' says Farley Cahen , an editor at Adult Video News .
' The problem is that more and more people are finding out about these sites and that they can get this free content . '
After a decade of double - digit growth , the porn industry is seeing sales of DVDs - its biggest money - maker - slip .
Last year , total sales were down 15 per cent .
The industry says it is laying off workers .
' Some people say porn is porn is porn , but consumers have preferences , ' says Cahen .
' Some like amateur , with neighbours in their socks in a poorly - lit setting . '
But ' most consumers like a more polished product with high quality production and prettier girls doing fun things ' .
YouPorn is a mysterious entity .
There is no contact information , no hint of where it is based .
A man claiming to be the owner named ' Stephen Paul Jones ' told Portfolio magazine that he was 27 and worked at a California hedge fund , where he managed billions in assets .
He claimed the site was not intended to make money : ' If you wanted to be philosophical about it , it 's kind of an exploitative industry and this is sort of the opposite . '
It is more probable that YouPorn is owned by Zach Hong , a Malaysian businessman who lives in Australia and is thought to be looking to sell it .
Regina Lynn , Sex Drive columnist for magazine Wired , says the easier it becomes for people to make and distribute their own content , the more they will do it .
' Despite social and professional stigmas , a lot of people are putting themselves on the internet .
It fits into this era of people expressing themselves , ' she said .
FADE IN around a serious - looking group of uniformed military officers .
At the head of the table , a senior , heavy - set man , GENERAL FRED , speaks .
GENERAL FRED : The reports are confirmed .
New York has been overrun ... by zombies .
COLONEL TODD : Again ?
But we just had a zombie invasion 28 days ago !
GENERAL FRED : These zombies ... are different .
They 're ... philosophical zombies .
CAPTAIN MUDD :
Are they filled with rage , causing them to bite people ?
COLONEL TODD :
Do they lose all capacity for reason ?
GENERAL FRED : No .
They behave ... exactly like we do ... except that they 're not conscious .
( Silence grips the table . )
COLONEL TODD : Dear God .
GENERAL FRED moves over to a computerized display .
GENERAL FRED : This is New York City , two weeks ago .
The display shows crowds bustling through the streets , people eating in restaurants , a garbage truck hauling away trash .
GENERAL FRED : This ... is New York City ... now .
The display changes , showing a crowded subway train , a group of students laughing in a park , and a couple holding hands in the sunlight .
COLONEL TODD :
It 's worse than I imagined .
CAPTAIN MUDD : How can you tell , exactly ?
COLONEL TODD : I 've never seen anything so brutally ordinary .
A lab - coated SCIENTIST stands up at the foot of the table .
SCIENTIST :
The zombie disease eliminates consciousness without changing the brain in any way .
We 've been trying to understand how the disease is transmitted .
Our conclusion is that , since the disease attacks dual properties of ordinary matter , it must , itself , operate outside our universe .
We 're dealing with an epiphenomenal virus .
GENERAL FRED : Are you sure ?
SCIENTIST : As sure as we can be in the total absence of evidence .
GENERAL FRED : All right .
Compile a report on every epiphenomenon ever observed .
What , where , and who .
I want a list of everything that has n't happened in the last fifty years .
CAPTAIN MUDD :
If the virus is epiphenomenal , how do we know it exists ?
SCIENTIST : The same way we know we 're conscious .
CAPTAIN MUDD : Oh , okay .
GENERAL FRED : Have the doctors made any progress on finding an epiphenomenal cure ?
SCIENTIST :
They 've tried every placebo in the book .
No dice .
Everything they do has an effect .
GENERAL FRED : Have you brought in a homeopath ?
SCIENTIST : I tried , sir !
I could n't find any !
GENERAL FRED : Excellent .
And the Taoists ?
SCIENTIST : They refuse to do anything !
GENERAL FRED :
Then we may yet be saved .
COLONEL TODD : What about David Chalmers ?
Should n't he be here ?
GENERAL FRED : Chalmers ... was one of the first victims .
COLONEL TODD : Oh no .
( Cut to the INTERIOR of a cell , completely walled in by reinforced glass , where DAVID CHALMERS paces back and forth . )
DOCTOR : David !
David Chalmers !
Can you hear me ?
CHALMERS : Yes .
NURSE : It 's no use , doctor .
CHALMERS : I 'm perfectly fine .
I 've been introspecting on my consciousness , and I can't detect any difference .
I know I would be expected to say that , but —
The DOCTOR turns away from the glass screen in horror .
DOCTOR : His words , they ... they do n't mean anything .
CHALMERS : This is a grotesque distortion of my philosophical views .
This sort of thing can't actually happen !
DOCTOR : Why not ?
NURSE : Yes , why not ?
CHALMERS : Because —
( Cut to two POLICE OFFICERS , guarding a dirt road leading up to the imposing steel gate of a gigantic concrete complex .
On their uniforms , a badge reads " BRIDGING LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY " . )
OFFICER 1 : You 've got to watch out for those clever bastards .
They look like humans .
They can talk like humans .
They 're identical to humans on the atomic level .
But they 're not human .
OFFICER 2 : Scumbags .
The huge noise of a throbbing engine echoes over the hills .
Up rides the MAN on a white motorcycle .
The MAN is wearing black sunglasses and a black leather business suit with a black leather tie and silver metal boots .
His white beard flows in the wind .
He pulls to a halt in front of the gate .
The OFFICERS bustle up to the motorcycle .
OFFICER 1 : State your business here .
MAN : Is this where you 're keeping David Chalmers ?
OFFICER 2 : What 's it to you ?
You a friend of his ?
MAN : Ca n't say I am .
But even zombies have rights .
OFFICER 1 : All right , buddy , let 's see your qualia .
MAN : I do n't have any .
OFFICER 2 suddenly pulls a gun , keeping it trained on the MAN .
OFFICER 2 : Aha !
A zombie !
OFFICER 1 : No , zombies claim to have qualia .
OFFICER 2 : So he 's an ordinary human ?
OFFICER 1 : No , they also claim to have qualia .
The OFFICERS look at the MAN , who waits calmly .
OFFICER 2 : Um ...
OFFICER 1 : Who are you ?
MAN : I 'm Daniel Dennett , bitches .
Seemingly from nowhere , DENNETT pulls a sword and slices OFFICER 2's gun in half with a steely noise .
OFFICER 1 begins to reach for his own gun , but DENNETT is suddenly standing behind OFFICER 1 and chops with a fist , striking the junction of OFFICER 1's shoulder and neck .
OFFICER 1 drops to the ground .
OFFICER 2 steps back , horrified .
OFFICER 2 : That 's not possible !
How'd you do that ?
DENNETT : I am one with my body .
DENNETT drops OFFICER 2 with another blow , and strides toward the gate .
He looks up at the imposing concrete complex , and grips his sword tighter .
DENNETT ( quietly to himself ) :
There is a spoon .
( Cut back to GENERAL FRED and the other military officials . )
GENERAL FRED : I 've just received the reports .
We 've lost Detroit .
CAPTAIN MUDD : I do n't want to be the one to say " Good riddance " , but —
GENERAL FRED : Australia has been ... reduced to atoms .
COLONEL TODD :
The epiphenomenal virus is spreading faster .
Civilization itself threatens to dissolve into total normality .
We could be looking at the middle of humanity .
CAPTAIN MUDD : Can we negotiate with the zombies ?
GENERAL FRED : We 've sent them messages .
They sent only a single reply .
CAPTAIN MUDD : Which was ...?
GENERAL FRED : It 's on its way now .
An orderly brings in an envelope , and hands it to GENERAL FRED .
GENERAL FRED opens the envelope , takes out a single sheet of paper , and reads it .
Silence envelops the room .
CAPTAIN MUDD :
What 's it say ?
GENERAL FRED : It says ... that we 're the ones with the virus .
( A silence falls . )
COLONEL TODD raises his hands and stares at them .
COLONEL TODD : My God , it 's true .
It 's true .
I ...
( A tear rolls down COLONEL TODD 's cheek . )
COLONEL TODD : I do n't feel anything .
The screen goes black .
The sound goes silent .
The movie continues exactly as before .

Battlefield Heroes is designed to run on older PCs
The PC game , Battlefield Heroes , will be available only online later this year , and will not be sold in shops .
The move marks EA 's first major attempt to tap into new sources of ad - driven revenue in Western markets .
The firm has a free version of its Fifa game in South Korea , earning more than $ 1 m a month through in - game sales .
" Online gaming has a massive audience , " said EA 's Gerhard Florin , in a statement .
" People want to play games in new ways , with easier access that is quick to the fun .
With Battlefield Heroes , EA brings its first major franchise to North America and Europe with a new distribution model and pricing structure adapted to the evolving way that people play . "
Digital distribution
The video games industry is taking its first steps away from a retail - focused sales environment and towards digital distribution .
Battlefield is a highly - successful series for EA and Dice
EA hopes the model of a free game as download that is supported by adverts and micro-payments could be applied to other franchises it owns .
The new version of Battlefield is designed to have more mass market appeal than current titles in the series , which have sold about 10 million copies worldwide .
The game has a " cartoon - feel " and has been made simpler to play , with more emphasis on participation and fun than skill and strategy .
Ben Cousins , senior producer at Dice , told BBC News that no adverts would be appear in the game itself .
" They would n't work inside the fictional world .
Instead , adverts will appear on the website and the ' front - end ' of the game . "
Gamers will be able to buy items which customise their appearance in the world , but will not be able to seek an advantage through buying weapons .
Mr Cousins said Battlefield Heroes was about exploring new revenue models as well as making a game more accessible .
You will be able to play this game on grandma 's laptop
Ben Cousins , Dice
" I 've always felt there was some really good fun core gameplay which was locked away by several barriers to entry : the game is complex , it is full of skilled people , you need quite a high - end PC on which to play and you need to go to store to purchase a copy . "
" We 're removing all barriers to entry and we hope there is broader audience for the title .
You will be able to play this game on grandma 's laptop . "
Mr Cousins said EA expected 95 % of people who played the game never to spend any money .
" If you look at Korea and Asia this is a model that works .
Given the enormous explosion in web - based gaming products , this is going to be a real source of growth in the industry and Battlefield Heroes is the first step towards doing that in West . "

Al - CIAda sock puppet Ayman al - Zawahiri was quoted in an audiotape released today accusing Iran of behind behind 9/11 conspiracy theories , in another crude public relations stunt designed to generate hostile opinion towards the 9/11 Truth Movement .
The tape had been promised three weeks ago by monitoring group IntelCenter , who have been caught in the past putting out fake and misleading " Al - Qaeda " material via the alleged media arm of the terrorist organization As - Sahab , and was finally released today .
The set - up revolved around Al - Zawahiri ’s responding to questions submitted by the public via the Internet .
One of the questioners asked about the theory that has circulated in the Middle East and elsewhere that Israel was behind the 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon , " reports the Associated Press .
Al - Zawahiri accused Hezbollah ’s Al - Manar television of starting the rumor .
" The purpose of this lie is clear — ( to suggest ) that there are no heroes among the Sunnis who can hurt America as no else did in history .
Iranian media snapped up this lie and repeated it , " he said .
As anyone with even a superficial knowledge of the 9/11 truth movement can attest to , the sock puppet Zawahiri ’s claim that Iran were the first to question the official 9/11 story is completely ludicrous .
Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad ’s recent bumbling comments about 9/11 , the date of which he cannot even accurately remember , were music to the ears of Neo -Cons who seized upon the statements as fodder to debunk the 9/11 Truth Movement .
Zawahiri ’s single sentence retort , and the fact that it has been used to generate headlines that link alternative theories about 9/11 with ‘ those evil Iranians ’ in a clear smear effort , is highly suspicious considering the history of these " Al - Qaeda tapes " and Zawahiri ’s own background .
Is this Neo -Con friendly Al - Zawahiri a different person to the real Al - Zawahiri who was reported to have been captured in Tehran in February 2002 ?
Is this a different Al - Zawahiri to the one reportedly captured near the Pakistan - Afghanistan border in September 2004 ?
Or is this the same Al - Zawahiri who , as the head of the Egyptian Islamic Jihad , fought for the CIA in Bosnia ?
Is this the same Al - Zawahiri who , according to January 2000 U.S. Congressional testimony , was granted U.S. residence by the Immigration and Naturalization Service – something almost impossible for many legitimate immigrants to obtain ?
Is this the same Al - Zawahiri whose brother Zaiman is running terrorist camps under NATO protection in the U.S. zone in Kosovo ?
Previous tapes which featured Ayman al - Zawahiri were found to be cobbled together from old footage but that does n’t bother a lapdog media well versed in manufacturing consent and never offering retractions when said tapes turn out to be questionable frauds .
A 2006 Ayman al - Zawahiri tape was studied by a computer expert , who discovered that the As - Sahab logo ( the alleged media arm of Al - Qaeda ) and the IntelCenter logo ( a U.S. based private intelligence organization that " monitors terrorist activity " ) were both added to the video at the same time – meaning the Pentagon - affiliated group releasing the tapes were slapping on the Al - Qaeda brand right before they released them to the media .
The expert suspiciously reversed his stance a day later despite producing detailed technical analysis to justify his claim .
Any credibility that these so - called " Al - Qaeda tapes " had was devastated after our investigation revealed that the people putting them out had connections into the highest ranks of the military - industrial complex .
In our exposé , we unveiled the ties between IntelCenter , a group that regularly ‘ obtains ’ Al - Qaeda tapes and the Pentagon .
IntelCenter is an offshoot of IDEFENSE , which was staffed by a senior military psy - op intelligence officer , Jim Melnick , who has worked directly for Donald Rumsfeld .
IntelCenter were behind the October 2006 release of the " laughing hijackers " tape that showed Mohammad Atta and Ziad Jarrah allegedly attending a 2000 Al - Qaeda meeting and reading their last will and testament .
Segments of the video that were interspersed with footage of the " laughing hijackers , " Jarrah and Atta , showing Bin Laden giving a speech to an audience in Afghanistan on January 8 2000 , were culled from what terror experts described as surveillance footage taken by a " security agency . "
News reports at the time contained the admission that the U.S. government had been in possession of the footage since 2002 , while others said it was found when the United States invaded Afghanistan in 2001 , and yet it was still bizarrely reported that the tape , bearing all the hallmarks of having been filmed and edited by undercover US intelligence and having admittedly been in US possession for five years , was released over the weekend of September 31 / October 1 by " Al - Qaeda " .
The video also contained segments that were first broadcast in a British documentary called The Road to Guantanamo , which was originally aired in March 2006 .
The context of the corresponding scene in the dramatized documentary featured U.S. interrogators attempting to coerce Gitmo detainees into confessing Al - Qaeda membership by showing them fake videos where their likeness had been computer generated to appear as if they were in attendance during Bin Laden ’s January 8 2000 speech .
IntelCenter were also behind the release of the July 2007 " new " Bin Laden tape , which in actual fact was old footage filmed in 2001 and had been released , including by IntelCenter itself , on no less than two previous occasions spanning back five years .
Al - Zawahiri has a history of popping up at the most politically expedient times , most notably when he appeared right before State of the Union speeches two years running , to attack Bush ’s policy in Iraq and allow him to use Al - Zawahiri ’s words as a rallying call to prolong the occupation , following in the footsteps of Dick Cheney and former Press Secretary Tony Snow , who had compared troop surge skeptics to Al - Qaeda sympathizers .
His latest comments linking the questioning of the official 9/11 story with America ’s supposed enemy , Iran , are transparently part of a crude ploy to allow the media to embark on a fresh round of demonizing legitimate 9/11 truth activists .

I have tremendous respect for Paul Graham .
His essays – repackaged in the book Hackers and Painters – are among the best writing I 've found on software engineering .
Not all of them are so great , of course , but the majority are well worth your time .
That 's more than I can say for 99.9 - infinitely - repeating - percent of the content on the web .
He 's certainly a better and more authoritative writer than I .
But lately I 've begun to wonder whether Mr. Graham , like Joel Spolsky before him , has devolved into self - absorption and irrelevance .
Consider his latest essay , You Were n't Meant to Have a Boss , which opens with this distasteful anecdote :
A few days ago I was sitting in a cafe in Palo Alto and a group of programmers came in on some kind of scavenger hunt .
It was obviously one of those corporate " team - building " exercises .
They looked familiar .
I spend nearly all my time working with programmers in their twenties and early thirties .
But something seemed wrong about these .
There was something missing .
And yet the company they worked for is considered a good one , and from what I overheard of their conversation , they seemed smart enough .
In fact , they seemed to be from one of the more prestigious groups within the company .
So why did it seem there was something odd about them ?
The guys on the scavenger hunt looked like the programmers I was used to , but they were employees instead of founders .
And it was startling how different they seemed .
So what , you may say .
So I happen to know a subset of programmers who are especially ambitious .
Of course less ambitious people will seem different .
But the difference between the programmers I saw in the cafe and the ones I was used to was n't just a difference of degree .
Something seemed wrong .
I think it 's not so much that there 's something special about founders as that there 's something missing in the lives of employees .
I think startup founders , though statistically outliers , are actually living in a way that 's more natural for humans .
I was in Africa last year and saw a lot of animals in the wild that I 'd only seen in zoos before .
It was remarkable how different they seemed .
Particularly lions .
Lions in the wild seem about ten times more alive .
They 're like different animals .
And seeing those guys on their scavenger hunt was like seeing lions in a zoo after spending several years watching them in the wild .
I 'm not sure why Mr. Graham felt the need to draw this incredibly condescending parallel with company employees and caged animals in the zoo .
I 've actually taken Mr. Graham 's advice .
I recently quit my job to blog and participate in a micro startup .
Even though I 'm now one of the anointed founders in Mr. Graham 's book , I still found this comparison retroactively offensive to all those years I worked as an employee for various companies and had perfectly enriching , rewarding – dare I say even enjoyable – experiences .
Or at least as happy as a caged animal in a zoo can ever be , I suppose .
Mr. Graham 's essay does contain some fair points , if you can suppress your gag reflex long enough to get to them .
If you do n't have time to read it , lex99 posted this succinct summary that captured its flavor perfectly :
I work with young startup founders in their twenties .
They 're geniuses , and play by their own rules .
Oh ... you have n't founded a company ?
You suck .
Small businesses are the backbone of the American economy .
And Mr. Graham is absolutely right to encourage young people to take risks early in life , to join small business startups with potentially limitless upside while they have nothing to lose – no children , no mortgage , no significant other .
I believe in this so strongly I included it as a slide in my presentation to graduating Canadian computer science students .
Indeed , you should take insane career risks while you 're young .
And there are lots of large corporate soul - sucking programming jobs that are , quite literally , Dilbert cartoons brought to life .
The problem with this particular essay is the way Mr. Graham implies the only path to true happiness as a young programmer lies in founding a startup .
If you are n't a founder , or one of the first 10 employees , then , well .. enjoy your life at the zoo .
We 'll be sure to visit when we are n't busy loping free on the plains , working the way people were meant to .
I 'm not paraphrasing here ; he actually wrote that : working the way people were meant to .
The sense of disdain , the dismissiveness , is nearly palpable .
He acknowledges that his perspective is warped because " nearly all the programmers [ he knows ] are startup founders . "
Therein lies the problem .
These essays are no longer about software engineering ; they 're about Paul Graham .
They 've become participatory narcissism :
After a while , you begin to notice that all the essays are an elaborate set of mirrors set up to reflect different facets of the author , in a big distributed act of participatory narcissism .
Naturally , every young software programmer worth a damn forms a startup .
Because that 's what Mr. Graham 's company , Y Combinator , does .
They fund startups with young software programmers .
He projects his reality outward , reflecting it against the rest of us so brightly and so strongly that we 're temporarily blinded .
We stop seeing our own reality and trade it for his , in a form of participatory narcissism – we believe in the one true path to success , exactly the way Mr. Graham has laid it before us .
Traditional employment ?
That 's for suckers .
Real go - getters start their own companies .
On the whole , I think I preferred Paul Graham 's essays when they were more about software engineering and less about Paul Graham .
You may have heard some of the buzz about a new result concerning the direct detection of dark matter particles in an underground laboratory .
The buzz originates from a new paper by the DAMA / LIBRA collaboration ; David Harris links to powerpoint slides from Rita Bernabei , leader of the experiment , from her talk at a meeting in Venice .
The new experiment is an upgrade from a previous version of DAMA , which had already been on record as having recorded a statistically significant signal of the form you would expect from the collision of weakly interacting massive particles ( WIMP's ) with the detector .
The experiment uses a challenging technique , in which their focus is not on eliminating all possible backgrounds so as to isolate the dark - matter signal , but to look at the annual modulation in that signal that would presumably be caused by the Earth 's orbital motion through the cloud of dark matter in the Solar System : you expect more events when we are moving with a high velocity into the dark - matter wind .
Other workers in the field have not been shy about expressing skepticism , but the DAMA team has stood their ground ; as Jennifer notes in her report from the recent APS Meeting , the DAMA collaboration home page currently features a quote from Kipling : " If you can bear to hear the truth you 've spoken / twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools , / ............... you 'll be a Man my son ! "
To help provide some insight and context , we 've solicited the help of a true expert in the field -- Juan Collar of the University of Chicago .
I got to know Juan back in my days as a Midwesterner , and a trip to his bustling underground experimental empire was always a highlight of anyone 's visit to the UofC physics department .
You can hear him talk about his own work in this colloquium at Fermilab ; he 's agreed to post for us about his views on the new DAMA result , and more general thoughts on what it takes to search for 25 % of the universe .
I promise you wo n't be bored .

My dear friend Sean has me blogging : hey , I ’ll try anything once .
On the subject of the recent DAMA results no less , as per his request .
I am normally a bit of a curmudgeon but ...
Sean , you really want the worst of me out there permanently on the internets , do n’t you ?
I ’ll try to keep this to the point .
A bard I am not , nor the subject invites any poetry .
I have therefore chosen brief eruptions of flatulence as the metric and style for this piece .
The result of indigestion , you see .
I ’ll start with the most negative , so as to end up on a brighter note :
The modulation is undeniable by now .
I do n’t know of any colleagues who doubted these data were blatantly modulated already back in 2003 , when " the lady " ( DAMA ) decided to keep mum for a while .
However , to conclude from something this mundane that the experiment " confirms evidence of Dark Matter particles in the galactic halo with high confidence level " or that there is " an evidence for the presence of dark matter particles in the galactic halo at 8.2 sigma confidence level " is simply delusional .
There is evidence for a modulation in the data at 8.2 sigma , stop .
Compatible with what would be expected from some dark matter particles in some galactic halo models , full stop .
Anything beyond this is wanting to believe , and it smears on the rest of us in the field .
Of course , of course ... there is no other observed process in nature that peaks in the summer and goes through a low in winter , so this must be dark matter , right ?
( Occam is turning in his grave , rusty razor still in hand .
He is thinking a remake of that opening scene in " Un chien andalou " , with help from this little lady .
I am channeling him loud and clear ) .
Someone should take the DAMA folks aside for a beer , make them see the following .
If one day soon we are all convinced that this effect was DM - induced ( see below for what that will really take ) , they will be recognized for one of the greatest discoveries in the history of science , without them having to look desperate or foolish today .
Or making the rest of us in the field do , by association : thanks DAMA , for cheapening the level of our discourse to truly imbecilic levels .
( Sean , if you edit this I will scratch the paint off your car .
I may not write blogs , but I do read them : I know how to hurt you ) .
Deep breath .
Having cleared the air some ( or just made it toxic , whatever ) , it is not DAMA ’s fault that there is a penury of signatures in this field of ours , laboratory searches for particle dark matter .
The one possible exception to this is a detector with good recoil directionality and sufficient target mass to be truly competitive , but we do n’t know of a good enough way to do this as of today ( " good enough " folds in the price tag ) .
People are still trying .
The diurnal modulation in the DM signal that would be sensed by such a device is wickedly rich in features , extremely hard for nature to imitate with anything else .
The annual modulation resides on the other side of this spectrum of complexity .
It is the poor man ’s smoking - gun to DM " evidence " .
Inspected carefully , it is disappointingly feeble : different models of the halo can shift the phase of this modulation completely , turning expected maxima into minima and vice - versa , changing the expected amplitude as well .
Add to this the fact that essentially every possible systematic effect able to pass for a " signal " can be yearly - modulated , for one reason or another .
That ’s the ones we can presently think of , and the ones yet to be proposed .
To grow convinced that we have observed dark matter in the lab we ’ll require a number of entirely different techniques , using a variety of targets , all pointing at the same WIMP ( mass , cross sections ) , with additional back - up information from accelerator experiments and from gamma-ray satellite observations ( so - called indirect searches ) .
All of those lines crossing at one point , so to speak .
This I ( for one ) will call " evidence " .
I know of no single existing or planned DM experiment , including those I participate in , that would be able to make anything close to a bulletproof claim on its own .
My advice to any overambitious individuals looking for a quick kill is to look elsewhere in physics .
WIMP hunting is not it , no matter how important the discovery of these particles might be .
I try to teach my students that a good experimentalist does not need any critics : he or she is his / her own worst enemy .
If you do n’t feel a sincere drive to debunk , test and revise your own conclusions , you should be doing something else for a living .
This intent is seemingly absent from the DAMA collaboration .
Sure , some obvious environmental parameters are kept constant and logged .
But this is simply not enough .
Again we see , like the last time , that the subject of a modulation in the photomultiplier ( PMT ) noise contaminating the data , which is on everyone ’s mind , is treated in a quite unsatisfying , suspiciously ad hoc fashion .
What will it take for DAMA to release a plot like those displaying the modulation in the 2 - 6 keV regions , but instead in the 1 - 2 keV region or even lower ?
( wait , I can hear the excuses , again ) .
If this modulation is WIMP - induced , we can predict how much of it should be visible in those lower - energy noise - contaminated bins , for different WIMP scenarios .
If this is just modulated PMT noise , there is a good chance that a careful , dedicated look further down in energy would settle the issue once for all .
I personally would love to see a 20 - page report produced on this issue only .
Why ?
Because as a graduate student I saw all sorts of modulations close to ( or into ) the noise in dark matter Germanium detectors , until my graduate advisor slapped some sense into me .
Noise is man-devouring hydra .
I find their reluctance to be exhaustive on this subject fascinating .
The sad way a polar bear at the zoo , retracing its own steps in an endless loop , is fascinating .
A suggestion for anyone high up in the Italian INFN willing to listen : form a committee of experts and charge them with taking the hard throughout look at the stability of low - energy data that DAMA is not willing to deliver .
There is much to gain and much to lose .
This sort of " audit " could be perceived as a punishment or a reward , it is in the eye of the beholder .
The importance of the claim certainly justifies it .
Much time and effort by others could be wasted if this " DAMA effect " is totally bunkum .
If it is not , we may be wasting time as we speak : the emphasis of other experiments should be reoriented .
A five year wait to have a mere rehash of the same tepid analysis , one that brought DAMA an unprecedented level of international criticism and scrutiny , seems an unbearable thought .

John McCain 's presidential campaign has delayed disclosing the 71 - year - old cancer survivor 's health information .
But it has asked his doctors to comprehensively address lingering questions and concerns about his medical history , including the prominent scar on the left side of his face .
" One of the problems has been getting the doctors together and getting everybody ready to meet at the same time , " McCain said Thursday during an interview on the daytime television talk show The View .
" But there 's plenty of time . "
The public already has a sense of McCain 's general health but does n't know all the details , particularly from more recent years .
Over the past 15 years , McCain has had four episodes of melanoma , a sometimes deadly form of skin cancer , and other instances of non-melanoma skin cancer .
But he has n't faced melanoma since 2002 .
His campaign has provided glimpses of a few other issues , such as high cholesterol , though none is particularly unusual for a man his age .
" Just like in 2000 , we will be releasing his medical records to prove what the doctors have been saying for a while : that John McCain is in very good health , " said Jeff Sadosky , a McCain campaign spokesman .
McCain , the presumptive Republican nominee , previously was aiming for the middle of this month , but the tentative date is now May 23 .
Three local doctors from the Mayo Clinic 's medical practice are expected to participate :
 Dr. John Eckstein , a Mayo internist and McCain 's regular physician .
 Dr. Suzanne Connolly , a dermatologist who diagnosed and treated McCain 's past skin cancer and can address precautions and likelihood of another tumor .
 Dr. Michael Hinni , an ear , nose and throat specialist and surgeon who can address the cosmetic issues related to McCain 's face .
McCain 's significant scar and related swelling , which is plainly visible in person , comes from his high - profile August 2000 melanoma surgery in Arizona .
Surgeons removed a dime - size localized lesion from his left temple and dissected his lymph nodes to make sure the cancer had n't spread .
At the same time , they cut out another melanoma on his left upper arm .
One national melanoma expert who is not one of McCain 's doctors said such a scar is not unusual given the procedure McCain underwent .
" He had surgery on his lymph nodes that is sort of more extensive than might often be done , " said Lynn Schuchter , an oncologist and professor of medicine at the Abramson Cancer Center at the University of Pennsylvania and chairwoman of the Melanoma Research Foundation 's scientific - advisory board .
" None of them showed melanoma .
... I think he decided to take a very aggressive approach , and that 's what they did . "
According to a one - page medical summary provided by the McCain campaign , the more complicated operation was " utilized out of a high degree of caution . "
The campaign also reports two other cases of lower - risk melanomas , each of which has already been publicized .
The first came off his left shoulder in 1993 .
Another was scraped off his nose in 2002 .
McCain also has undergone treatment for , according to his campaign , " several " non-melanoma skin cancers and still gets three to four dermatological checkups a year .
The 2000 melanoma on his temple was considered Stage IIA , the second of four stages measuring how much the cancer has spread .
The higher the stage number , the more dangerous the cancer is and the harder it is to treat .
" Stage II melanoma patients can certainly be cured of their melanoma , " Schuchter said .
Politically , cancer no longer carries the stigma it once did .
This year , two of McCain 's GOP foes , Rudy Giuliani and Fred Thompson , also had bouts with forms of the disease .
" Thirty years ago , that word was a problem , " said John Geer , a political scientist at Vanderbilt University in Tennessee .
" It 's not such a problem now .
We 'll see how it 's handled . "
In late 1999 , as McCain geared up for his first presidential run , he allowed journalists to review about 1,500 pages of his medical history dating to 1973 , when he was released from a North Vietnamese prisoner - of - war camp after more than five years in custody .
The campaign likely will make the more recent health information available to the media in a similar setting at a hotel near the Mayo Clinic 's Scottsdale campus .
At McCain 's insistence , reporters will be allowed to study his medical documents for 90 minutes .
As many as 750 journalists could take part in a related teleconference .
According to the campaign , McCain takes the cholesterol medicine Vytorin , a multivitamin and , as a heart - attack preventative , low - dose aspirin .
His cholesterol level is 155 .
When allergy symptoms flare , he 'll pop a Claritin or spray some Flonase .
McCain enjoys exercising and in August 2006 hiked the Grand Canyon " from rim to rim " and experienced no cardiopulmonary problems , his campaign 's medical summary says .

This new building in Seattle by Weber +
Thompson requires no air conditioning .
To achieve this feat , the architects made use of numerous passive cooling elements throughout the building .
Passive cooling means no electricity or other fuel is needed — instead strategic shading and orientation is used , rather than high - tech gadgetry .
The building has green - tinted glass shades ( or sunglasses ) that shield windows from heat , while still allowing light into the building .
A heat - reflective coating on the windows will also reduce temperatures .
The 40,000 square foot structure has a central courtyard , which allows cross breezes to enter all parts of the building , and allows more natural light inside .
Adjustable windows will allow employees to actively manage their environment .
Kristin Dispenza on Green Building Elements says :
While in the design phase , thermal modeling was performed for the space .
It was determined that , for a structure located on this particular site ( and built without air conditioning ) , there could be 18 to 20 hours per year that the interior temperature will climb above 80 degrees .
Weber +
Thompson ’s headquarters will be , in many ways , a ‘ test case ’ for passive cooling design , although not one which can be easily copied in less temperate climates .
Weber +
Thompson has set up a blog to track the performance of the building , so it will be interesting to watch over the next couple of years and see whether the passive cooling strategies perform as planned , and what , if any , follow - up measures need to be taken .

Reverse - Engineering Exploits from Patches
This is interesting research : given a security patch , can you automatically reverse - engineer the security vulnerability that is being patched and create exploit code to exploit it ?
Turns out you can .
What does this mean ?
Attackers can simply wait for a patch to be released , use these techniques , and with reasonable chance , produce a working exploit within seconds .
Coupled with a worm , all vulnerable hosts could be compromised before most are even aware a patch is available , let alone download it .
Thus , Microsoft should redesign Windows Update .
We propose solutions which prevent several possible schemes , some of which could be done with existing technology .

Its designer , Alan Kaufman , came up with the idea while watching shoppers struggle with umbrellas on a windy day .
" We all know the problem with umbrellas is that they invert , that 's where I came up with the idea .
They are not great in the wind , " he said .
" I never planned on inventing a product , I just noticed a problem and came up with a solution . "
The former tennis pro , 45 , spent six years developing the Nubrella .

Al - Qaeda accuses Iran of 9/11 lie
BBC News
22/04/2008
Al - Qaeda 's deputy leader , Ayman al - Zawahiri , has blamed Iran for spreading the theory that Israel was behind the 11 September 2001 attacks .
In an audio tape posted on the internet , Zawahiri insisted al - Qaeda had carried out the attacks on the US .
He accused Iran , and its Hezbollah allies , of trying to discredit Osama Bin Laden 's network .
Correspondents say the comments underline al - Qaeda 's increasing public hostility towards Iran .
In a two - hour audiotape posted on an Islamist website , Osama Bin Laden 's chief deputy responded to questions posted by al - Qaeda sympathisers .
In response to a question about persistent rumours in the Middle East that Israel was involved in the 9/11 attacks , Zawahiri said the rumour had begun on the Hezbollah television station , Al - Manar .
" The purpose of this lie is clear - [ to suggest ] that there are no heroes among the Sunnis who can hurt America as no- one else did in history , he said .
" Iranian media snapped up this lie and repeated it . "
Sunni fears
Zawahiri went on to criticise Iran for co-operating with the US in its 2001 invasion of Afghanistan , that helped to oust the Taleban .
" Iran 's aim here is also clear - to cover up its involvement with America in invading the homes of Muslims in Afghanistan and Iraq , " he said .
This is the second verbal attack on Iran , a predominantly Shia Muslim country .
Earlier this month , in an audiotape marking the fifth anniversary of the fall of Iraq 's leader Saddam Hussein , the al - Qaeda deputy accused Iran of planning to annexe southern Iraq and the eastern part of the Arabian peninsula .
BBC security correspondent Rob Watson says such messages appear designed to play on Sunni fears throughout the region of growing Iranian influence , and to present al - Qaeda as the best bulwark against Tehran .
Ever since the 9/11 attacks , Sott.net , along with many others commentators ( including US government officials ) , have repeatedly stated that " al - qaeda " is a fabricated enemy .
That it is used to justify the Ziocon 's military rampage though the Middle East while simultaneously terrorising the folks back home .
In the past 7 years the world public has repeatedly been treated to bogus missives from " al - Qaeda leaders " that strangely echo the Islamophobic claims of the leaders of the Western world .
Every time a member of the US or Israeli government expounded on the " Muslim terror threat to freedom and democracy everywhere " , soon afterwards " al - Qaeda " obligingly popped up with a new video or statement in which they threatened freedom and democracy .
As the massive holes in the US government 's official story of the 9/11 attacks continue to widen , and sites like Sott. net continue to point to the real culprits in Tel Aviv and Washington DC , disembodied internet voices that US government officials " believe to be that of Osama bin laden " , set the record straight and claim responsibility .
In spite of such strenuous efforts to fool the entire world , fewer and fewer people are buying the terror hysteria , and recently the desperation on the part of the Ziocons has begun to show .
On April 22 , the CIA / Mossad chose to have Mr. Magoo stand - in and " al - Qaeda number 2 " " al - Zawahiri " , do something which , until now , was almost unthinkable .
Allow me to translate this into common parlance for you :
" Do n't believe those crazy conspiracy theorists who point to the massive inconsistencies in the official story !
Take it from me , arch - Muslim terror boogeyman al - Zawahiri , it was " al - Qaeda " WE DID IT !
It was NOT Israel !
You must support your glorious leaders in the White House and Israel in their continued murder and butchery of innocent Muslims of the Middle East !
You must support them in their attempts to find a justification for attacking Lebanon and Syria and Iran and murdering millions of Iranian and Lebanese and Syrian civilians !
Remember !
It was NOT Israel !!" Now , you may be wondering why a " worldwide Islamic terror group " is defending Israel against " 9/11 conspiracy theories " and threatening another Muslim nation .
You may also be thinking that al - Zawahiri 's words closely resemble the Bush government 's demand that we should " never entertain outlandish conspiracy theories about the 9/11 attacks " .
You will however remain in your state of bewilderment up until the point that you make the leap of logic to the obvious conclusion : that " al - Qaeda " is actually a fully controlled US / Israeli government asset and is dragged out every so often to provide the " reality " of " Islamic terrorism " .
Is it so hard to consider the idea that , since the 9/11 attacks were the casus belli for an expansion of empire that was planned many years beforehand , that those who are waging the war were most probably behind the 9/11 attacks ?
At this late stage in the war - on - terror farce , anything that comes from " al - Qaeda " can safely be taken , almost word for word , as the policy , intentions or desires of the Ziocons .
From its original role as an excuse to attack Muslim nations of the Middle East , today " al - Qaeda " is being used as an actual arm of the US / Israeli / British military - industrial complex .
With " al - Zawahiri's " recent verbal attacks on Iran , it is quite possible that the US , British and Israeli military and civilian intelligence agencies will begin to stage large - scale attacks within Iran ( or on Iranian assets in the Middle East ) and have " al - Zawahiri " , in the form of some disembodied voice on the internet , claim responsibility .
From a manufactured war on Islamic terrorism to an equally manufactured war between Islamic peoples of the Middle East , and all of it hinged upon a truly outrageous fantasy called " al - Qaeda " .

Huckabee : Amend Constitution to be in ' God 's standards ' David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Tuesday January 15 , 2008
del.icio.us |
Print This Email This The United States Constitution never uses the word " God " or makes mention of any religion , drawing its sole authority from " We the People . "
However , Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee thinks it 's time to put an end to that .
" I have opponents in this race who do not want to change the Constitution , " Huckabee told a Michigan audience on Monday .
" But I believe it 's a lot easier to change the Constitution than it would be to change the word of the living god .
And that 's what we need to do -- to amend the Constitution so it's in God 's standards rather than try to change God 's standards so it lines up with some contemporary view . "
When Willie Geist reported Huckabee 's opinion on MSNBC's Morning Joe , co-host Mika Brzezinski was almost speechless , and even Joe Scarborough could n't immediately find much to say beyond calling it " interesting , " Scarborough finally suggested that while he believes " evangelicals should be able to talk politics ... some might find that statement very troubling , that we 're going to change the Constitution to be in line with the Bible .
And that 's all I 'm going to say . "
Geist further noted of Huckabee that if " someone without his charm , " said that , " he'd be dismissed as a crackpot , but he 's Mike Huckabee and he 's bascially the front - runner . "
This video is from MSNBC's Morning Joe , broadcast January 15 , 2008 .
LONDON ( Reuters ) -
The government warned Israel on Friday over the expansion of Jewish settlements , saying any building on occupied Palestinian lands , including in East Jerusalem , was illegal under international law .
Foreign Secretary David Miliband arrives at NATO headquarters ahead of a NATO foreign ministers meeting at the Alliance 's headquarters in Brussels March 6 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Yves Herman
“ We are very concerned about recent reports of Israeli settlement activity , ” Foreign Minister David Miliband said in a written response to a query during a question - and - answer session on www.reuters.co.uk.
“ Britain considers that Israeli settlement building anywhere in the occupied Palestinian territories is illegal under international law .
This includes settlements in both East Jerusalem and the West Bank , ” he wrote .
The questions were asked last month and answered by Miliband on Thursday , before a Palestinian gunman shot dead at least eight students at a Jewish religious school in the western part of the city , the deadliest Palestinian attack on Israelis since April 2006 .
Israel announced in February it intended to build 1,100 new homes in East Jerusalem , which Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war and annexed unilaterally in a move that is not recognised internationally .
The Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of a future state and fear Israel ’s building of settlements in the there is an attempt to dilute their presence in the city and cut them off from the rest of the West Bank .
Miliband said he had raised his concerns with both Israel ’s foreign minister , Tzipi Livni , and the defence minister , Ehud Barak .
“ The Roadmap is clear , ” he said , referring to the 2002 peace plan drawn up by U.S. President George W. Bush .
“ Israel should freeze all settlement activity , including the natural growth of existing settlements . ”
Britain ’s criticism follows a more critical line adopted by the United States in recent weeks towards Israel ’s settlement policies and its 40 - year occupation of the West Bank , where around 2.5 million Palestinians live .
In a rare criticism of Israel , Bush in January described the country ’s settlement expansion as an “ impediment ” to peace , and during a visit to the region the same month said the occupation of the West Bank should end .

As Democratic voters in Pennsylvania cast their presidential ballots today , the latest nationwide Gallup Poll Daily tracking results show Barack Obama with a 10 percentage point lead over Hillary Clinton .
Obama has held a statistically significant lead the last two days after Clinton enjoyed a temporary increase in support following last Wednesday 's Philadelphia debate , which brought the race back into a statistical dead heat .
Prior to that , Obama led Clinton for 11 consecutive days , with margins ranging from seven to 11 points .
( To view the complete trend since Jan. 3 , 2008 , click here . )
Clinton is expected to prevail in Pennsylvania , according to the pre-election polls , but the pundits are focusing speculation on the size of the margin .
A big win could give her campaign a boost and make a comeback seem more possible .
A close win would probably not alter the dynamics of the race , and make her campaign 's arguments that she can overcome Obama 's delegate lead less persuasive .
An Obama win could lead to heavy pressure from Democratic Party leaders for Clinton to drop out of the race .
Gallup Poll Daily tracking data will begin to show any national impact of the Pennsylvania results on Thursday , since tonight 's polling will involve a mixture of interviewing conducted before and after the winner of that contest is known .
Neither Democrat can claim stronger positioning against John McCain at this point .
Among registered voters nationwide , McCain and Obama are even at 45 % , while McCain outpolls Clinton by a single point , 46 % to 45 % . -- Jeff Jones

Survey Methods
For the Gallup Poll Daily tracking survey , Gallup is interviewing no fewer than 1,000 U.S. adults nationwide each day during 2008 .
The Democratic nomination results are based on combined data from April 19 - 21 , 2008 .
For results based on this sample of 1,259 Democratic and Democratic - leaning voters , the maximum margin of sampling error is ±3 percentage points .
The general election results are based on combined data from April 17 - 21 , 2008 .
For results based on this sample of 4,367 registered voters , the maximum margin of sampling error is ±2 percentage points .
In addition to sampling error , question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls .

Good ol ’ Michael Arrington of TechCrunch had an interesting weekend in which he learned how to minimize the classic ISP runaround ( i.e. , the customer service you get when your Internet stops working ) .
He had 36 hours of downtime before , as he puts it , he lost his cool and posted to Twitter this message : “ I am going to expend significant energy over the next three weeks trashing comcast . ”
It only took 20 minutes after his Twitter message for a Comcast executive in Philadelphia to call him asking the “ how can I help ” question .
The executive explained that he monitors Twitter and blogs to get an understanding of what people are saying about Comcast .
Soon after the call , a team was dispatched to Arrington ’s place and the issue was resolved .
This sure beats what he experienced earlier with the automated phone system and misleading customer service .
The whole episode reminds me of the time last year when I had to go without Internet for two months .
Lots of factors were to blame , but Verizon did not handle the situation very well .
Next time anything like this happens , it seems that I should know exactly what to do .
I ’ll give them one chance to fix it and then start blogging / tweeting from a friend ’s house .
When you use the Internet more than practically anything else at home ( it ’s my phone book / maps / weather / driving directions / calendar / dictionary / encyclopedia / banking / movie show times / reviews / credit cards / bills / shopping / streaming movies / music downloads / pictures / email / news / order tracking ) , the lifestyle change even for a short period of time is a huge pain .
But before I get too excited with this new found ISP customer service solution , I wonder , will it work for those who are n’t big shots ?
And even if it does , how sustainable is that kind of model ?
If only the regular customer service were good enough in the first place so that this kind of work around would n’t be necessary …
The Government and Accountability Office ( GAO ) has concluded that the Federal Communications Commission does nothing with about four out of every five consumer complaints that it puts into a database and investigates .
Even worse , the GAO could not discern from its survey of the FCC 's complaint process why the FCC takes no enforcement action with 83 percent of the complaints it looked into from 2003 through 2006 .
" Without key management tools , FCC may have difficulty assuring Congress and other stakeholders that it is meeting its enforcement mission , " the GAO report warns .
That 's putting it mildly .
If the FCC does set up some serious net neutrality guidelines for ISPs like Comcast , how can P2P application users and other consumers know that the agency will take their comments seriously ?
Scope of the problem
Most complaints that the FCC receives go through the agency 's Consumer and Governmental Affairs Bureau ( CGB ) .
According to the GAO 's report , released on Thursday , from 2003 through 2006 the CGB received and logged 454,000 consumer grievances into its database .
Violations of the agency 's Do Not Call List and telemarketing during prohibited hours rules won first prize for gripes : 178,078 during the period studied .
This was followed by complaints for overbilling , bad cellphone service , and then false advertising .
Charges that some TV program contained obscene , indecent , or profane material ranked number six in a list of ten specific categories .
Slamming — switching a consumer 's service from one company to another without their permission , and cramming — padding a customer 's bill with bogus charges , came in eighth and ninth , with over 19,000 complaints .
To most of these missives the FCC sent the consumer a formal response and suggested that they contact the company about which they had complained .
But the agency 's Enforcement Bureau did conduct investigations of about 46,000 requests for help .
About 3,400 of these inquiries resulted in some enforcement action : a letter of admonishment or fine usually .
But the Bureau closed 83 percent with no response , and could not demonstrate to the GAO 's satisfaction why .
The GAO did , however , come to conclusions as to why Enforcement could not explain its own inaction in so many cases .
The Bureau uses five different databases and " tens of thousands of paper case files " to keep track of its work .
" Consequently , we could not use the Enforcement Bureau ’s databases to obtain bureau - wide information on the one - year statute of limitations for imposing monetary forfeitures , the speed with which the Enforcement Bureau closed an investigation , the reasons for closing investigations with no enforcement action , or the amount of the fines FCC assessed , " the GAO report disclosed .
" Our past work has shown that when data management systems are not integrated and compatible , excessive use of resources and inconsistent analysis of program results can occur . "
Implications and reactions
Net neutrality supporters should be concerned about these findings , because the Enforcement Bureau 's five divisions include its Telecommunications , Market Disputes Resolutions , and Spectrum Enforcement departments .
The first division " investigates and takes or recommends enforcement action for violations of consumer - related obligations of common carriers and other telecommunications entities . "
The second settles cases involving " consumer - related obligations of common carriers and other telecommunications entities . "
And Spectrum Enforcement deals with network reliability problems .
If Enforcement can't even explain at this point why it dropped a huge percentage of the complaints that it investigated , how will it manage the complexity of the P2P / Comcast problem if the FCC establishes rules against Comcast blocking or slowing down protocols like BitTorrent ?
Not surprisingly , the GAO report recommends that the FCC update its Enforcement database system .
The FCC has responded to the study , insisting that since 2006 it has implemented many of the GAO 's recommendations , and that the report used outdated data to come to its conclusions .
Strangely , the FCC criticizes the GAO survey for relying on information " that is more than four years old . "
But the point of the study was to survey the FCC 's activities over a broad period time , not just the last six months .
The GAO responds to the FCC 's critique by noting that the agency expects to modernize its CGB databases some time this year , but has disclosed no plans for upgrading its Enforcement Bureau databases .
The Parents Television Council has also issued a response to the GAO study .
Titled " GAO Needs a New Calculator , " the indecency watchdog group takes exception to what it suggests may be a deliberately lowered number of indecency complaints reported in the GAO survey .
Indeed , while the study reports 16,076 indecency related complaints from 2003 through 2006 , my own tracking of comments , based on the FCC 's CGB complaint page , indicates a far higher number .
" The GAO ’s math is obviously fuzzy , " the PTC declares .
" The Janet Jackson Super Bowl striptease produced over 65,000 complaints from PTC members alone , in addition to the hundreds of thousands of people who complained to the FCC directly about this .
According to data on the FCC web site today there have been 2.13 million indecency complaints during the time period studied in the GAO report .
It appears that the GAO is attempting to intentionally diminish public sentiment on broadcast decency . "
But if the PTC had looked a little more carefully at the GAO report 's source disclosures , they might have noticed that the survey does not count the number of complaints " filed at the FCC from 2003 - 2006 , " as the PTC 's press release states , but the number of complaints the GAO could find in the CGB 's database .
Inadvertently , the PTC has exposed not a plot to underestimate the number of consumers who complained based on the groups ' recommendations ( and possibly after watching the program themselves ) , but the sad fact that the CGB 's own database system may not keep up with the agency 's publicly disclosed data .
In any event , the PTC should be heartened by the FCC 's statement in its recent throttling of Fox TV's " Married by America " that even one indecency complaint can potentially trigger an investigation .
" " We have followed this course in the past and will continue to do so in the future , " the Commission promised .
For net neutrality advocates , however , the message is clear : the FCC needs to modernize its systems before it can take on additional oversight , especially oversight that may be as contentious and technically complex as net neutrality rules may generate .

HOLY crap !
Enough with “ normal ” beauty routines such as placenta and kitty litter – New Yorkers can now add nightingale No. 2 to their beauty regimens .
For just $ 216 , Shizuka Bernstein will slather your face in feces for a full 50 minutes – what she calls the “ Geisha Facial ” – at her Midtown spa , Shizuka New York .
The ancient Japanese cleanser – geishas and kabuki dancers have been using the bird poop to wash off their heavy white makeup since the 18th century – contains guanine , which supposedly removes pollutants and blackheads , and helps even out skin tone .
“ My English is not perfect , it ’s my second language .
And they [ her customers ] know I could be making mistake with what I was saying .
And they would ask me if I was sure , if I was really talking about bird poop , ” says the Japanese native , describing what her customers thought when she first introduced the fecal facial .
The exotic excrement comes in a powder form , directly from Japan , and is sterilized with UV light to kill bacteria .
And while there is an odor – Bernstein says it smells like “ hay ” or “ like outside ” – it ’s not the kind you would expect .
“ The Japanese women are obsessed to have white skin .
Always .
Porcelain - white skin , ” she says .
“ All Japanese mothers tell their daughters to become white .
I would have vitamin C tablet every day , and she told me not to go out in the sun .
She told me about nightingale droppings too , but I did n’t use it .
Then , many , many years later , I thought about what my mom said . ”
As always , mom ’s right .
While the treatment is technically full of crap , customers swear the claims are not .
“ I figure if poop was good for the soil , it ’s good for your face , ” says Marilyn Phillips , a 58 - yearold Upper West Sider who had a Geisha Facial late last week .
“ And it does n’t smell at all .
I ’d say hair coloring smells way worse . ”
Like Phillips , 32 - year - old massage therapist Andrea Nieto went in for the facial last week .
“ You would n’t even know it was nightingale droppings .
And after , my skin was softer than it had been in a really long time .
And it looked clearer to me , too , ” she says , admitting her friends did laugh at her when she announced what she was paying to have smeared on her face .
“ But you gotta wonder how they figured to use these things .
Who put 2 and 2 together like that ? ”

BEYOND THE CALL OF BEAUTY
Ever since ancient Egyptians mixed unguents of bile of steer , ostrich eggs and resin , people have slathered on everything from the odd to the oogy .
Plenty of other unusual ingredients – in addition to avian excrement – are thought to have beautifying properties .
Snake venom : From face creams to lip products , beauty companies swear the stuff reduces wrinkles and has a plumping effect .
Kitty litter :
The grainy texture works as an exfoliator .
Yeah , yeah – just put the idea away for when the recession really hits .
Placenta : Dogs eat it .
Hospitals save it .
And some women use it to soften their hair and skin .
24 K gold :
The shiny precious metal might help increase circulation and tighten skin .
* Illustration : Christian Montenegro * I 'm sitting in a second - floor classroom at Denver East High School , hunched over a desk , exerting a death grip on a No. 2 pencil .
My brain is overheating .
I have two difficult problems .
This is the first : z = x - y + 4.z = y - w - 3.z = w - x +

A ) 2 ; B ) 3 ; C ) 4 ; D ) 6 ; E ) 12 .
And here 's the second :
What object can I use to persuade the pimply 17 - year - old sitting next to me to stop with the frickin ' whistling ?
The first time I took the Scholastic Aptitude Test was in 1985 .
I scored 1,120 out of a possible 1,600 , thank you very much : 510 verbal , 610 math .
When I signed up to take the test last autumn , I had visions of sweating through a Wi-Fi-enabled , digitally administered , robotically proctored exam that would peer into my deepest soul .
But no .
Today 's SAT is the same endurance test it was back then : pencils and filled - in bubbles , bored proctors and stuffy study halls , anxiety and panic .
" With the SAT , it turns out paper and pencil are a pretty good way of doing it if you want it available everywhere , " says Laurence Bunin , a senior vice president at the College Board , the organization that administers and grades the test .
The biggest recent change is the writing portion , including a 25 - minute essay question , added after the University of California threatened to stop using the SAT because it failed to properly evaluate writing skills .
There 's debate about whether the section has addressed that concern .
MIT professor Les Perelman found that writing longer , with bigger words , is a more felicitous route to a quantitatively greater result .
More than half of the 1,000 or so four - year colleges in the US disregard the writing component entirely .
Me , I sort of liked the essay topic : " Can people ever be truly original ? "
I finished in 15 minutes , then smirked at Pimple Face , who chicken - scratched until the end .
Then came the math .
I am a 38 - year - old writer who uses Google to calculate percentages .
Suddenly I was looking at algebra .
Geometry .
Functions .
I stared at the booklet , trying mightily to recall Mr. Willis ' fifth - period class .
The SAT deducts a quarter point for wrong answers , so I left 10 of the 20 questions blank .
Pimple Face finished early .
That 's when he started whistling .
The worst part is , I even studied .
While the SAT itself remains drably low tech , study methods have made great leaps forward .
There are online practice exams , emailed questions of the day , SparkNotes ' iPod Vocabulary Builder , and an entire review course conducted in Second Life .
I 'd been lulled into overconfidence by some of these quick - hit , digitized study aids .
They certainly did n't hurt , but they are n't the hardcore training one needs .
Sadly , on test day I realized that one online practice exam and a few questions of the day are useless preparation for a nearly four - hour exam .
Still , I improved on my 1985 score by 130 points .
A 480 in math ?
Still humiliating .
But a 770 in critical reading ?
Not bad .
I notched a 680 in the new writing category , but my score on the essay question — the College Board breaks out a separate assessment — was shockingly low .
One grader gave me 4 out of 6 ( " adequate mastery " ) , the other 3 ( " displays developing facility in the use of language " ) .
That 's 7 out of 12 .
Overall score : 1,930 out of 2,400 .
Once again , I made the cut for the University of Michigan ... if they overlook the math .
When I was in high school I almost certainly would have known the answer to the above problem : A. Today , all I have going for me is wisdom and clear skin .
And , thank goodness , access to Google .

North Korea : VICE Guide on The Darkest of Countries
North Korea has had it ’s share of coverage on Weird Asia News for being so… well … weird .
We have reported on North Korea publicly executing people for using cell phones , eating dog meat to help deal with summer heat , and how their own leader is a better golfer than Tiger Woods .
North Korea has always been somewhat a place of mystery , due to strict rules against media and journalist entering , or reporting , about anything within their country .
Even when foreigners are allowed to enter the country , they must be escorted by secret police and government officials at all times .
Even North Koreans themselves are extremely controlled .
There is a cable radio system that is wired into almost all establishments and provides the news and commentary to most North Koreans .
There is a limited number of radio stations or television stations , all of which are controlled by the government .
So much is the control on media that most North Koreans do not even have cameras or internet access at all .
So when the opportunity came up for a small group of reporters to be allowed entrance into the country to cover the Arirang Mass Games in Pyongyang , VBS decided to step up and take the risk to hopefully bring back some insights on the infamous communist country of North Korea .
VBS , an online broadcast network from VICE magazine , had issues from day one .
“ Getting into North Korea was one of the hardest and weirdest processes … ” “ They finally said they were going to allow 16 journalists into the country .
Then , ten days before we were supposed to go , they said , â€ œNo , nobody can come.â€ 
Then they said , â€ œOK , OK , you can come .
But only as tourists.â€ 
They already knew we were journalists , and over there if you get caught being a journalist when you ’re supposed to be a tourist you go to jail .
We do n’t like jail .
And we ’re willing to bet we ’d hate jail in North Korea . ”
VBS finally got the “ go ahead ” to visit North Korea and brought back a series of 14 videos on North Korea , which they are releasing on their website – The VICE Guide to North Korea .
So risky was their endeavor that they were almost charged with a criminal offense for recording when they were not supposed to .
Here are a few of our favorites and make sure to head over and catch the whole series .

TORONTO ( Reuters ) --
There is little debate that obesity presents a public health issue in North America -- obesity rates have more than doubled over a generation in the United States , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
But the causes of obesity -- and therefore , the solutions -- are not as obvious , according to research presented this week at a media workshop run by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research .

The problem of obesity cannot be reduced simply to genetics , the researchers said , and it also cannot be blamed solely on our environments or learned behaviors .
Media coverage , they advised , should highlight that the obesity epidemic is the result of a variety of factors , and that change requires a comprehensive approach that tackles the problem from all sides .
“ Obesity ’s not rocket science , ” said Dr. Diane Finegood , director of CIHR ’s Institute for Nutrition , Metabolism and Diabetes .
“ It ’s a lot more complex . ”
Biological factors like genetics or diet play a key role .
Genetics help to determine where we gain weight , said Dr. Jean - Pierre Despres , a professor at Universite Laval in Quebec .
And where our genes tell our body to store fat -- whether we ’re an apple shape that stores it on our stomachs or a pear shape that stores it on our hips -- is an important factor for determining our cardiovascular risk , he said .
Research done by Despres and others has shown that excess fat around the stomach -- visceral fat -- carries a higher risk for both diabetes and cardiovascular disease , no matter what a person ’s body mass index is ; as a result , Despres advocates for the importance of waist circumference as a vital health measurement to be used in conjunction with more traditional indicators of cardiovascular risk like blood pressure and blood cholesterol measurement .
Despres described an international study he was involved with , where 6400 doctors in 63 countries were shown how to properly measure waist circumference in their patients .
In looking at the waist measurements and health status of 170,000 patients , the researchers found higher rates of diabetes in those with the highest waist measurements , whether or not their body mass index classified them as overweight or obese .
“ This is really making the point that private care physicians , when they are told and shown how to measure waist circumference , are not measuring noise , ” he said .
For someone who discovers that his or her waist is too large , and wants to lose weight to reduce the measurement , the solution would seem to be easy : eat less and move more .
“ Obesity is the outcome of a positive energy balance , ” said Dr. Angelo Trembley , a professor at Universite Laval .
But research done by Trembley and others has shown that it may not be that simple .
A variety of biological factors that would n’t automatically occur to us may also be contributing to the dramatic rise in obesity rates , he said .
There is evidence suggesting that micronutrients -- vitamins and minerals found in food -- may affect fat loss or gain , Trembley said .
For example , a study led by Trembley found that female subjects in a placebo group could n’t achieve significant weight loss , despite following a carefully restricted diet , while those who took a calcium supplement showed better weight loss results .
It ’s possible that as with glucose , the brain can recognize low levels of micronutrients like calcium , Trembley said , and regulates appetite control in order to correct them .
“ We cannot exclude the possibility at this time that some individuals might gain some weight due to deficiencies in some vitamins and minerals , ” he said .
Poor sleep is another factor that may affect the body ’s ability to control appetite , Trembley said .
A lack of sleep can increase ghrelin and decrease leptin , two hormones , which results in increased hunger and appetite .
The Quebec Family Study showed that short - sleepers were more likely to be heavier , he said , with more body fat and a larger waist circumference .
“ We are maybe not making optimal life choices , ” Trembley concluded .
“ Modernity is providing a new way of living that is providing a positive energy balance . ”
Data collected by Dr. Gillian Booth , and other researchers working with her at Toronto ’s St. Michael ’s Hospital , illustrated that it is not just our individual lifestyle choices that are contributing to obesity , but our environments , our cultures and our political landscapes as well .
North America is facing an epidemic of diabetes due to increases in obesity rates , Booth said , and her report on diabetes in Toronto for the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences showed that diabetes rates in the city of Toronto were highest in areas of the city found to be less friendly to healthy choices -- fewer sidewalks and bike paths , less access to fresh fruits and vegetables , fewer parks and recreational spaces , and fewer family physicians taking new patients .
Diabetes rates also showed strong correlations to ethnicity -- many non-white ethnic groups have higher diabetes rates than Caucasians -- and economics -- there were higher diabetes rates in areas with lower average incomes .
“ It may be that the availability of resources and where you live may be much more important for socially disadvantaged groups , ” Booth said , “ who are already at a higher risk for diabetes . ”
If we know that genetics play a role , and lifestyle plays a role , and environment plays a role , how do we fight the obesity epidemic ?
By attacking it from all sides , said Dr. Kim Raine , a researcher at the University of Alberta in Edmonton .
We know that toxic environments that promote obesity do n’t occur suddenly but develop over time , Raine said , and that there needs to be social action at multiple levels in order to promote healthy weight loss .
“ We do have power in collective efforts . ”
For changes to make a difference in people ’s behavior , and then in their health , they must be comprehensive , addressing the physical , economic , sociocultural and political environment people live in , Raine said -- comparable to the public health campaign against tobacco use .
For example , research done at the University of Alberta found that the city of Edmonton had 61 supermarkets , but 761 fast food outlets , many of which were concentrated in poorer neighborhoods .
There were 2.7 times the number of fast food restaurants in poorer neighborhoods than in middle - class or high - income neighborhoods , Raine said , and a similar ratio has been found in research done in the United States and Australia .
A promotional campaign encouraging people to eat fresh fruits and vegetables will have a limited effect if people cannot easily find those items near their homes .
Effective interventions do not have to be excessively expensive , Raine pointed out .
The Children ’s Lifestyle and School Performance Study , a project of Dalhousie University in Nova Scotia , found that children in schools with a nutrition program that included parents , teachers and their community -- at a cost of only $ 100 per child annually -- had obesity rates less than half those of children in schools without the program .
But children in schools with a more basic nutrition program did n’t show results much better than those in schools with no program at all .
The difference illustrates why single moves like removing pop machines from schools are a good first step , she said , but not a total solution .
“ It ’s the comprehensive nature of the intervention that seems to make the difference , ” Raine said , “ not just little one - offs . ”
Scientists hunting an invisible form of matter that pervades the universe and holds galaxies together claim to have found it underneath a mountain in Italy .
The discovery , at a laboratory built deep into the Gran Sasso mountain in Abruzzo , could end a 70 - year race to find the elusive " dark matter " that physicists believe accounts for 90 % of the mass of the universe .
Its existence was first postulated in 1933 by a Swiss astronomer who observed that distant galaxies must be held together by a huge gravitational pull caused by some apparently invisible form of matter .
It gained the name " dark matter " because it does not shine or reflect light .
Researchers led by Dr Rita Bernabei at the University of Rome claim that a giant detector inside the mountain laboratory has picked up signs of dark matter .
The signal suggests that it could be made of theoretical particles known as axions .
The discovery was announced at a physics conference in Venice .
The experiment was designed to detect dark matter in space as Earth flies through it .
Scientists are unlikely to take this single result as hard proof .
Many say the discovery will have to be replicated by groups around the world before they can be sure they have finally shed light on dark matter .
Earlier this year British researchers became the latest to join the hunt , using a laboratory deep inside an old salt mine in Yorkshire .
The labs are built underground to shield them from other particles that could smother dark matter signals .
" We are pretty sure now that this is not a statistical fluke , " said astrophysicist Frank Halzen , of the University of Wisconsin - Madison , who heard Bernabei 's talk at the conference .
" We should pay attention to this .
We should not just ignore it , " he told New Scientist .
newswire article reposts global government Chavez re-nationalises SIDOR  historic victory for the workers author : Jorge Martine At 1.22 am Venezuelan time on Wednesday , April 9th , Venezuelan vice - president Ramon Carrizalez announced the decision of president Chávez to renationalise the giant steel plant SIDOR located in the southern state of Bolivar .
The decision was taken as the Argentinean - Italian multinational group Techint ( the majority shareholder of SIDOR ) refused to make concessions to the workers in the collective bargaining agreement .
The workers of SIDOR have been struggling for more than 15 months fighting for improvements in wages , conditions and health and safety in the collective bargaining agreement .
The main points of contention were : 1 ) wage increase , where the company offered very little and wanted to spread any increase over a 30 - month period ; 2 ) the question of subcontracting , where the workers were demanding that all subcontracted workers ( 9,000 out of a total workforce of 15,000 ) should be incorporated into the main workforce , and 3 ) that there should be a substantial increase in the pensions of retired workers who were receiving less than the minimum wage .
SIDOR was privatised in 1997 under the government of Caldera , when the former guerrilla Teodoro Petkoff ( now a prominent opposition leader ) was in charge of privatisations .
SIDOR is now owned by Argentinean - Italian multinational Techint which has made multi-million profits on the back of massive overexploitation of the workers which has resulted in a marked increase in deaths and accidents at work .
José " Acarigua " Rodriguez , leader of the workers ' union SUTISS , described the ten years of privatisation as years of " humiliation and ill treatment on the part of the multinational , which has outraged the workers and the country " and blamed Techint for the 18 workers who have died in the plant in accidents .
When Chavez made a call to " nationalise all that was privatised " , in January 2007 , the workers responded with spontaneous walkouts and by raising the Venezuelan flag over the SIDOR installations .
They were demanding the nationalisation of SIDOR .
Finally , after many negotiations and pressure from the Argentinean government of Kirchner an agreement was reached between Techint and the Venezuelan government .
The company was to sell to the national market at preferential prices and in exchange there was not going to be any nationalisation .
But this was an agreement that could not last .
Throughout the 15 months of the collective bargaining negotiations the company has maintained a provocative attitude .
Finally , the workers ' patience run out and they started a series of stoppages in January , February and March .
What was the response of the Ministry of Labour ?
First of all they tried to impose binding arbitration on the workers .
Then the National Guard was sent to brutally repress the workers on March 14th during an 80 - hour strike .
Several workers were arrested , including union leader Acarigua , and many were injured during the attack .
The National Guard acted in a particularly vicious manner , damaging the workers ' cars and other property .
The workers , the masses and the whole region responded with a clear class instinct , organizing solidarity meetings and pickets , threatening strikes in other plants , etc .
This incident was the most serious clash between workers and the National Guard during the Chávez government , even worse than when the Aragua police blocked Sanitarios Maracay workers from attending a Freteco demonstration in Caracas .
The workers denounced the fact that the local commander of the National Guard was in close contact with the company management and basically was acting on their orders .
Here we see one of the most important challenges facing the Venezuelan revolution .
The old state apparatus , created and perfected over 200 hundred years to serve the interests of the ruling class , although weakened by the revolution , is still basically intact , and it is still attempting to serve the same interests .
As a Bolivarian MP for Guyana said : " I consider these abuses to be a long way from the revolutionary principles promoted by the President of the Republic . "
El Zabayar , who came out publicly for the nationalisation of SIDOR further explained that , " There are sectors within the state that play at wearing down the government , using governmental authorities to assume a pro-bosses attitude " .
This is precisely the problem : the state apparatus remains largely the same , and a capitalist state cannot be used to carry out a socialist revolution .
Even after this brutal repression , the Ministry of Labour ( which also played a dreadful role in the Sanitarios Maracay struggle ) , insisted on calling a referendum of the workers to make them accept the company 's proposal .
José Melendez , another leader of SUTISS , harshly criticised the role of the Ministry : " They accuse us of being troublemakers for rejecting their ballot .
More than once we have shown our support for the revolution , but this does not mean we are going to allow the Minister of Labour to follow a counter - revolutionary and anti-worker policy , which , at the end of the day , only benefits the right wing . "
And he added : " The Minister says that we are against the process that we are counter - revolutionary , but the truth is that the one who is damaging president Chávez 's reputation is the Minister , the one who is acting in favour of the right wing is the Minister , by acting as a spokesperson for the company " .
The workers remained united and correctly opposed this ballot and called their own on April 3rd , with two options : 1 ) to accept the company 's offer , 2 ) to mandate the union to continue talks .
The overwhelming majority of the workers rejected SIDOR 's offer , with 3338 voting against and only 65 in favour .
March to the Bolivarian University
March to the Bolivarian University
Then , on April 4th , the workers went on strike again and marched to the Bolivarian University in Bolivar , where president Chávez was attending a graduation ceremony and demanded to be heard .
As a result of this pressure , president Chávez intervened in a live TV programme on April 6th , to take a position ( full video here ) .
Among other things he recalled that the SIDOR workers and others from the basic industries in Guyana opposed the bosses ' lock - out in 2002 , " even when they received death threats , and even when they cut off gas supplies from Anaco , they marched to Anaco and clashed with the police " .
He added that the conditions of the workers were " horrible " and that the " revolutionary government has to demand from any company , national or multinational , Latin American , Russian or from any part of the world , to abide by Venezuelan laws " , referring to the law passed on May Day last year which outlaws subcontracting .
He also announced that he had instructed the Vice - president Ramon Carrizalez to meet with SUTISS leader Acarigua and then with the company to try to settle the issue .
He added that his government was one which , " respected Marxism , Marxist tendencies and the Marxist method " and that it was a " pro-workers ' government " which " would know how to take the necessary measures " .
He explained that he always tries to " look for agreement , negotiation and so on , but in relation to SIDOR , as of yesterday , I said enough is enough " .
Chávez also added that his intervention was the result of the workers going to the graduation meeting in Bolivar and getting the information directly to him .
He added that he had had harsh words with the regional governor over the repression of the National Guard against the workers , and that he had also talked to the commander of the National Guard to remind him of " old instructions to take care of the workers " .
This intervention by Chávez through the vice - president was in fact a slap in the face to the regional governor and above all to the Minister of Labour Rivero .
Their authority was superseded and the government sided clearly with the workers .
The company , which until that moment had said that they would not talk to the workers again , agreed to a new meeting .
A three party meeting between the company , the union and the vice - president took place on Tuesday 8th , in which the company made minor concessions .
Just after midnight , the vice - president Carrizalez , who had said that the meeting could not end without an agreement , asked the company one last time if they were not prepared to make a counter - offer to the union 's final offer on wages , and when the company refused he asked this to be recorded in the minutes .
He then stepped out , called president Chávez and came back to the meeting to announce the re-nationalisation of SIDOR .
Thousands of workers immediately started to celebrate a victory that they did not even believe was possible .
In fact the leadership of the union had declared a few hours before that after signing the collective bargaining agreement they would then continue the campaign for the nationalisation of SIDOR .
This is yet another turning point in the Venezuelan revolution and a clear indication of the direction it should take .
This is not a small bankrupt company that has been taken into public ownership , but the country 's only supplier of steel and Latin America 's fourth largest producer .
This decision is likely to provoke a backlash on the part of the multinational and also on the part of the Argentinean government which in the past has put a lot of pressure on Chávez in defence of Techint .
The Venezuelan revolution and its supporters abroad , particularly in Argentina , must be ready to withstand this pressure and launch a campaign in defence of this nationalisation .
The workers of SIDOR should take immediate steps to implement workers ' control in order to prevent the company from engaging in any kind of sabotage , seize the installations , control the stocks and above all they should proceed to open the account books of the company .
The issue of compensation will now arise .
The company will probably demand an outrageous sum of money .
The best way to settle this is precisely by opening the accounts of the company .
If you calculate the amount that was originally paid by the multinational ( very little ) , the investment they have made in the plant ( very little ) , and then you deduct the profits they have made in the last 10 years ( a lot ) , you will easily reach the conclusion that they are not actually entitled to any compensation at all .
More importantly , this nationalisation comes mainly as a result of the pressure of the workers in struggle , who were also encouraged by Chávez 's recent announcement of the nationalisation of the whole of cement production in the country .
This is a mobilised and aroused workforce which will now demand workers ' control .
In previous nationalisations , including the recent one of a dairy plant , Chávez has insisted that the workers must set up " Workers ' Councils " or " Socialist Councils " .
These must be used by the workers and the union SUTISS to exercise workers ' control and management .
As Venezuelan workers know only too well , nationalisation in itself does not guarantee the interests of the workers and the Venezuelan people .
After all , PDVSA was for more than 25 years a state - owned company and a massive bureaucracy developed which responded to the interests of the oligarchy and the oil multinationals .
Bolivar is one of the most important concentrations of the industrial working class in Venezuela , a decisive factor in the revolution .
The victory of the SIDOR workers will also encourage workers in other basic industries in the region to go forward and struggle for democratic workers ' control .
The re-nationalisation of SIDOR is another step forward in the right direction .
In the last few months , the oligarchy has stepped up its campaign of sabotage of the economy , particularly the food distribution sector .
At the same time imperialism has increased its provocations , threatening to put Venezuela on the list of countries that " harbour terrorism " .
It is now time to take decisive steps forward by nationalising the fundamental levers of the economy under the democratic control of the workers and finally completing the revolution .

Crude oil has surged for a fourth day as the feeble dollar and lacklustre stock markets increased the appeal of commodities for investors .
Oil and gold prices surged to record highs yesterday as the dollar fell to close to its lowest level ever against the euro .
Gold hit a new high near $ 980 an ounce , and crude oil set an all - time high of above $ 103 a barrel – both beating the real - terms peaks reached in 1979 - 80 .
Many traders believe that gold at $ 1,000 an ounce is now well within reach .

Corn and soya beans have also tested new records .
New York silver futures , meanwhile , broke the much - anticipated $ 20 - an - ounce level .
Commodities that are traded and denominated in dollars usually move for technical reasons in the opposite direction to the US currency .
A falling greenback makes dollar - denominated commodities cheaper for holders of other currencies , though the scale of recent movements has few parallels .
Gold is also a traditional hedge against inflation , especially in Asia .
It was a question of dollar weakness rather than commodity strength per se .
The dollar fell to the lowest for almost three years against the yen and endured its biggest drop against the euro since September as the markets bet that the Federal Reserve will continue its policy of aggressively cutting rates , making the returns from dollar investments look less attractive .
Fed vice - chairman Donald Kohn in effect said last week that economic weakness was a bigger concern than inflation .
During yesterday , oil prices eased from their earlier record highs as supply concerns linked to particular production problems in Ecuador , Nigeria and the UK were partly allayed .
A fire at the Shell Bacton natural gas terminal in Norfolk , for example , will not affect energy supplies overall , as was at one point feared .
There is also doubt as to what Opec ministers will decide on production levels at their summit in Vienna next week .
The group of 11 nations including Saudi Arabia , Kuwait and Venezuela account for about 40 per cent of world oil production , and about two thirds of the world 's proven oil reserves .
They are widely expected to roll over their current quotas .
" Opec will probably not cut output as the market is too sensitive , but I do not think they are seeing much demand for oil , " said Olivier Jakob of Petromatrix .
" Not many refiners are saying Opec should increase production ...
Prices are being driven by the currency markets .
The central banks have more control over the oil price than Opec , so I do n't see them [ Opec ] taking any action at this meeting . "
Some analysts are sceptical about the extent to which non-Opec producers such as Norway , Russia and Kazakhstan can increase production .
Geopolitical tensions in the Middle East , Iraq and Iran are destabilising the market .
Analysts at Deutsche Bank added : " The five largest Opec members are Saudi , Iran , Venezuela , Nigeria and Iraq .
With the exception of Saudi , none is investing sufficiently aggressively to meet their future role in world oil supply . "
The breakneck pace of economic growth in China and other emerging nations also underpins commodity prices .
Poor economic data from the US did n't help sentiment , with the confirmation that the American economy expanded by an annualised rate of 0.6 per cent in the last quarter of 2007 .
That compares with the annualised 4.9 per cent growth rate in the third quarter .
Without export growth on the back of a weakening dollar , GDP growth would have turned negative .
Such a sharp deceleration has few precedents in US economic history .
Contrary to our previous beliefs , identical twins are not genetically identical .
This surprising finding may be of great significance for research on hereditary diseases and for the development of new diagnostic methods .
How can it be that one identical twin might develop Parkinson 's disease , for instance , but not the other ?
Until now , the reasons have been sought in environmental factors .
The current study complicates the picture .
The researchers studied 19 pairs of monozygotic , or identical , twins and found differences in copy number variation in DNA .
Copy number variation ( CNV ) occurs when a set of coding letters in DNA are missing , or when extra copies of segments of DNA are produced .
Humans receive one chromosome from their mother and one from their father , providing for two copies of the genome .
In some cases , bits of DNA are missing from a chromosome , leaving the offspring with just one copy of that bit of DNA .
In other instances , mutations may produce three , four or more copies of a particular bit of DNA .
In most cases , variation in the number of copies likely has no impact on health or development .
But in others , it may be one factor in the likelihood of developing a disease .
Researchers at UAB ( University of Alabama ) , Leiden University Medical Center and VU University , The Netherlands ; and Uppsala University and Karolinska Institutet , Sweden recently published their findings . *
“ The presumption has always been that identical twins are identical down to their DNA , ” said Carl Bruder , Ph.D. and Jan Dumanski , Ph.D. , of UAB ’s Department of Genetics and the study ’s lead authors .
“ That ’s mostly true , but our findings suggest that there are small , subtle differences due to CNV .
Those differences may point the way to better understanding of genetic diseases when we study so - called discordant monozygotic twins …. a pair of twins where one twin has a disorder and the other does not . ”
Bruder points out that one twin might develop a particular disease … Parkinson ’s , for example … while the other does not .
Previously , it was thought that environmental factors were the likely culprits , not genetics .
Bruder and Dumanski think their findings indicate that CNV may play a critical role and this can be efficiently studied in identical twins .
“ More importantly , changes in CNV may tell us if a missing gene , or multiple copies of a gene , are implicated in the onset of disease , ” Bruder said .
“ If twin A develops Parkinson ’s and twin B does not , the region of their genome where they show differences is a target for further investigation to discover the basic genetic underpinnings of the disease . ”
The UAB lab is one of the few worldwide that can make the full genome BAC ( bacterial artificial chromosome ) arrays that are used to find the changed DNA regions .
The findings were published Feb. 14 online in the American Journal of Human Genetics .

Do students have rights to the material they hand in as class assignments ?
Is plagiarism detection a form of fair use ?
These and a number of other intriguing questions were answered in a decision ( PDF ) handed down by a US District Court in Virginia recently , which threw out a lawsuit filed by students whose school compelled them to use an automated plagiarism detection system .
The combination of the Internet and copy - and - paste has made plagiarism easier than it has ever been .
iParadigms , the company named in the suit , runs a service called turnitin that allows teachers and professors to automate the process of plagiarism detection .
Students can submit their work online to turnitin , which will then produce an " originality report " based on comparisons with known material .
Over 7,000 schools have signed contracts with the service , which now handles over 100,000 documents daily .
In addition to comparing submissions with material on the Internet , turnitin manages an internal database of materials .
The contract agreements many schools sign allow the company to populate this database with materials submitted by their students .
The students involved in this case went to one such school , and they claimed that this agreement infringed the copyrights to their own work , given that parts of their essays could resurface whenever similar text appeared in future reports generated by turnitin .
Judge Claude M. Hilton went through the students ' arguments methodically and found them all wanting .
To use the service at all , the students had to agree to a clickthrough statement that absolved iParadigms from legal liability , and the decision notes that , " many courts have found clickwrap agreements to be enforceable . "
The students had tried to get around this by attaching a disclaimer to the material they submitted , but Hilton noted that the agreement had no provisions for disclaimers .
The suit also tried to argue that the agreement was invalid on a couple of grounds .
It suggested that it was unenforceable due to their status as minors , but the court noted that minors can't legally renege on a contract that has been fulfilled ; in this case , the students got their originality report , and it was used by their school .
Their lawyers claimed that the agreement was entered under duress — the school requires the report before grades are issued — but the law does n't appear to recognize duress applied by third parties .
In any case , the duress that was applied fell far short of the standard of " an unlawful or wrongful act . "
Even if the contract had n't been binding , the decision concluded that the use of student submissions for plagiarism detection fell well within the bounds of fair use .
Citing the Perfect 10 vs. Google case , Hilton found that iParadigm 's use of the students ' essays was transformative and valuable .
In contrast , student essays in their normal form were viewed as having no market , and their reuse by turnitin did not in any way diminish the students ' " incentive for creativity " — namely , their grades .
i Paradigms tried to play hardball and filed a countersuit based on the fact that one of the students submitted a report under false pretenses , using the account information of a UCSD student .
Hilton decided that iParadigms was n't harmed by the deception , and threw those claims out , too .
With everything handled by summary judgement , the case is over unless any party decides to appeal .

" My own years as a teenager were marred by a sinister regime that thought it had all the answers , " he told the crowd at St. Joseph 's Seminary in Yonkers .
" Its influence grew , infiltrating schools and civic bodies as well as politics and even religion before it was fully recognized for the monster it was , " the pope said .
" Many of your grandparents and great - grandparents will have recounted the horror of the destruction that ensued .
Indeed , some of them came to America precisely to escape such terror . "
As he praised the spread of democracy and respect for human rights , the pope cautioned about the dangers people face in the modern world .
" I am thinking of those affected by drug and substance abuse , homelessness and poverty , racism , violence and degradation -- especially of girls and women , " the pope said .
And he decried " new injustices , " including environmental problems .
The Earth " groans under the weight of consumerist greed and irresponsible exploitation , " he said .
The pope received a rousing welcome at the rally , with about 25,000 young Catholics from throughout the United States cheering , chanting " We love you " and waving white and yellow scarves as he arrived .
The crowd also sang " Happy Birthday " in German , applauding when the pontiff said he gave them an " A - plus " for their German pronunciation .
Benedict turned 81 on Wednesday .
Before Saturday 's rally , he blessed a group of children with disabilities and told them it was a special joy to spend time with them .

" Sometimes , it is challenging to find a reason for what appears only as a difficulty to be overcome or even pain to be endured , " the pope told the children and their caregivers .
" God has blessed you with life and with differing talents and gifts .
Through these , you are able to serve him and society in various ways . "
He shook hands with and touched the faces of the children , many of whom were in wheelchairs .
Earlier , Pope Benedict XVI again addressed the Catholic Church 's sexual abuse scandal , assuring priests , nuns and other religious of his " spiritual closeness " as they recover from the scandal 's damage .
" I have already had occasion to speak of this and of the resulting damage to the community of the faithful , " he said during Mass at St. Patrick 's Cathedral in New York .
" I join you in praying that this will be a time of purification for each and every particular church and religious community and a time for healing .
I also encourage you to cooperate with your bishops who continue to work effectively to resolve this issue . "
At a prayer service with U.S. bishops Wednesday in Washington , Benedict said the sexual abuse of children by priests has caused a " deep shame " and called it " gravely immoral behavior . "
A day later , Benedict spoke and prayed with a small group of people who say they were sexually abused by members of the clergy .
Saturday 's Mass for members of the religious community marked the third anniversary of Benedict 's election to the papacy .
The pope entered the sanctuary in a grand procession , wearing gold - trimmed white vestments and a white papal miter embroidered with a gold cross .
The congregation greeted him with prolonged , enthusiastic applause after he was welcomed by Cardinal Edward Egan , archbishop of New York .
Watch the pope celebrate Mass at St. Patrick 's »
St. Patrick's , on Fifth Avenue , has been considered the center of Catholic life in the United States .
It draws millions of visitors each year .
" I am particularly happy that we have gathered in St. Patrick 's Cathedral , " the pope told the thousands assembled beneath its vaulted roof .
" Perhaps more than any other church in the United States , this place is known and loved as ' a house of prayer for all peoples , ' " he said , alluding to a verse from the Bible .
Earlier in the Mass , Mayor Michael Bloomberg addressed the clergy .
" Since its beginning , New York has stood as a beacon of religious tolerance and celebration , " he said .
On Friday , Benedict visited Park East Synagogue , becoming the first pope to visit a Jewish house of worship in the United States .
" I find it moving to recall that Jesus , as a young boy , heard the words of Scripture and prayed in a place such as this , " the pope said .
Congregation members presented the pope with a Passover Seder plate , placed at the center of the dinner table during the holiday marking the occasion when Jews were led out of slavery in Egypt .
He was also given a box of matzo and a Haggadah , the prayer book used during Passover .
In turn , the pope presented Rabbi Arthur Schneier , leader of the Park East Synagogue , with a Jewish manuscript .
In his welcoming remarks , Schneier called the visit historic .
Benedict 's three - day visit to New York is the second leg of the pope 's six - day trip to the United States , his first since he was elected to the papacy .
On Sunday , the last day of his trip , he will visit Ground Zero and celebrate Mass at Yankee Stadium .

( CBS ) A Republican operative in Alabama says Karl Rove asked her to try to prove the state ’s Democratic governor was unfaithful to his wife in an effort to thwart the highly successful politician ’s re-election .
Rove ’s attempt to smear Don Siegelman was part of a Republican campaign to ruin him that finally succeeded in imprisoning him , says the operative , Jill Simpson .
Simpson spoke to Pelley because , she says , Siegelman ’s seven - year sentence for bribery bothers her .
She recalls what Rove , then President Bush ’s senior political adviser , asked her to do at a 2001 meeting in this exchange from Sunday ’s report .
“ Karl Rove asked you to take pictures of Siegelman ? ” asks Pelley .
“ Yes , ” replies Simpson .
“ In a compromising , sexual position with one of his aides , ” clarifies Pelley .
“ Yes , if I could , ” says Simpson .
Simpson says she found no evidence of infidelity despite months of observation .
Rove would not speak to “ 60 MINUTES ” , but elsewhere has denied being involved in efforts to discredit Siegelman .
Siegelman was convicted of bribery in a case that has drawn criticism from Democrats and Republicans .
In fact , 52 former states ’ attorneys general from both political parties petitioned Congress to investigate Siegelman ’s case , resulting in hearings held last fall .
“ I have n’t seen a case with this many red flags on it that pointed towards a real injustice being done . ”

I 'd like to propose that the Scheme language as defined by the current standards ( R4RS and IEEE ) be declared the - final - version of Scheme .
I see that yet another what - does - scheme - need - to - make - it - a - real - world - language thread is starting up on the Scheme mailing list and everybody is going to waste their time arguing about whether records are more important than exceptions , or about how utterly bogus the R4RS macro appendix is , or how a C language interface is what Scheme needs ( I - refuse - to call it a " foreign function interface " ) , or about which of a zillion little utilities it needs ( my personal favorite is `sort ' -- why can't I have `sort '? ) , or what kind of support for object - oriented programming Scheme should have , or about modules , or about binary I/O , or about window systems , or ...
Let people continue to invent languages with lexical closures and first - class continuations .
Let them use S - expressions and support bignums .
If they want , let them even use the names `lambda ' , `car ' , and `cond ' .
Just do n't let them call the result " Scheme " .
Let the history books say : " Scheme evolved for about 20 years , starting in 1975 and petering out in the early 1990s .
It 's designers declared that their work was finished and moved on to better things . "
I suggest declaring the current state of Scheme to be as close to an optimal point in programming language design space as humanly achievable , planting the Scheme flag firmly on that spot , and then everybody marching resolutely away in different directions .
Selling botnets for particular attacks , black markets for stolen identities , and malware construction kits are all now par for the course for the increasingly commercial malware industry .
Discovering that malware authors have actually turned to End - User License Agreements ( EULAs ) in an attempt to protect their own intellectual property , however , most definitely qualifies as something new , different , and beautifully ironic .
Symantec security researcher Liam OMurchu has details on this latest development .
The help section of the latest version of the Zeus malware states that the client has no right to distribute Zeus in any business or commercial purpose not connected to the initial sale , cannot examine the source code of the product , has no right to use the product to control other botnets , and cannot send the product to anti-virus companies .
The client does agree to " give the seller a fee for any update to the product that is not connected with errors in the work , as well as for adding additional functionality . "
Modern license agreements take a great deal of ( deserved ) fire for being absurdly draconian , but even the likes of Adobe and Microsoft do n't claim that purchasing a version of their respective products locks the user into buying future editions .
It 's obviously difficult for the manufacturers of an illegal product to threaten legal sanctions against an infringer , but the Zeus authors give it their best shot .
According to the EULA , " In cases of violations of the agreement and being detected , the client loses any technical support .
Moreover , the binary code of your bot will be immediately sent to antivirus companies . "
Frankly , " We 'll blow your kneecaps off and feed them to you , " might be a bit more effective as a threat , but I suppose it 's a bit hard to carry out that threat over the Internet .
If the folks behind Zeus are serious — and they seem to be — they 've obviously got a rather warped sense of reality .
Data thieves and malware authors are n't going to win any " Most Likely to Respect Intellectual Property " competitions , and they may not be particularly intimidated by a promise to turn their work into anti-virus companies , seeing as they can do the same thing to the original author of the malware in question .
The prospect of a fully commercialized malware distribution system is n't an idea anyone in security IT relishes , but watching illegal businesses attacking each other over illegal modifications to illegal products could be downright hilarious .

ARCHIVES | SEARCH Mass SQL Injection Posted by Patrik @ 03:59 GMT
There 's another round of mass SQL injections going on which has infected hundreds of thousands of websites .
Performing a Google search results in over 510,000 modified pages .
As more and more websites are using database back - ends to make them faster and more dynamic , it also means that it 's crucial to verify what information gets stored in or requested from those databases — especially if you allow users to upload content themselves which happens all the time in discussion forums , blogs , feedback forms , et cetera .
Unless that data is sanitized before it gets saved you can't control what the website will show to the users .
This is what SQL injection is all about , exploiting weaknesses in these controls .
In this case the injection code starts off like this ( note , this is not the complete code ) :
DECLARE%20@S%20NVARCHAR( 4000 ) ; SET%20@S=CAST( 0x440045004300

or b…
What happens as a result ?
It finds all text fields in the database and adds a link to malicious javascript to each and every one of them which will make your website display them automatically .
So essentially what happened was that the attackers looked for ASP or ASPX pages containing any type of querystring ( a dynamic value such as an article ID , product ID , et cetera ) parameter and tried to use that to upload their SQL injection code .
So far three different domains have been used to host the malicious content — nmidahena.com , aspder.com and nihaorr1.com .
There 's a set of files that gets loaded from these sites that attempts to use different exploits to install an online gaming trojan .
Right now the initial exploit page on all domains are unaccessible but that could change .
So if you 're a firewall administrator we recommend you to block access to them .
So what should you do ?
First of all , search your website logs for the code above and see if you 've been hit .
If so , clean up your database to prevent your website visitors from becoming infected .
Second , make sure that all the data you pass to your database is sanitized and that no code elements can be stored there .
Third , block access to the sites above .
Fourth , make sure the software you use is patched , F - Secure Health Check is an easy way to do this .
Fifth , keep your antivirus solution up - to - date .
UPDATE : We 've received some questions on the platform and operating systems affected by this attack .
So far we 've only seen websites using Microsoft IIS Web Server and Microsoft SQL Server being hit .
Do note that this attack does n't use vulnerabilities in any of those two applications .
What makes this attack possible is poorly written ASP and ASPX ( . net ) code .
A case of smallpox
The following is a compilation of facts I extracted from a psychology thesis I wrote several years ago entitled " A STUDY FOCUSING ON THE FORMATION OF OPINION , AND THE KNOWLEDGE ASSOCIATED WITH ITS DEVELOPMENT . "
The study itself is long and boring but there are some facts I 'd like to bring to light about the United States government and the history of biological weapons and warfare , especially as it relates to the aforementioned government .
I want to make this absolutely clear , this particular article should not frighten the reader , the truth is that biological agents are very unpredictable and can harm those that unleash them just as it can those targeted .
To sum it up neatly , after decades of research the United States government 's conclusion concerning defense against biological agents is that there is no defense against them , a virus can be quickly and inexpensively " tweaked " so that all known vaccines are rendered ineffective , meaning that vaccine manufacturers would have to start all over from the beginning , which is quite time consuming and expensive , thus there really is no point if you get my meaning .
I wrote the above thesis back in 2002 when I still believed the government 's " official version " of what happened on 9 - 11 .
When I still believed the government 's " official version " of the anthrax letters .
Needless to say , I no longer believe these lies .
What the United States government and for that matter , most western governments have more than proven of late , is that they cannot be trusted and are not representing their national populations .
Just today I read where an entire Italian University was shut down to prevent Dr. Robert Faurisson from speaking there .
For those of you unfamiliar with Dr. Faurisson , he 's a notable " historical revisionist , " that doubts the " official version " of the holocaust narrative .
I ask you the reader , what is the University so frightened of ?
Have you ever heard of such a thing ?
In any case , below I have included a number of facts the Zionist media and Zio-American government will never tell you about .
All of them are cited / sourced in the bibliography of my thesis , so please , do not hesitate to investigate further .
1 . Mathew Meselson a professor of molecular biology at Harvard , and American notable in the area of chemical and biological warfare , reinforces the fact that the United States government has extensively researched and developed biological weapons in the past .
Meselson described an American facility , north of Terre Haute , Indiana , built in 1944 that would have produced 500,000 four pound anthrax bombs monthly once in full operation .
Professor Meselson 's notable achievements in the field of biological weapons research include being part of teams that proved the accidental release of anthrax at a Soviet facility in 1979 , disproved charges of biological warfare in Laos and Cambodia in the late 1970s , and Meselson was a driving force behind popularizing the Chemical Weapons Convention in 1994 ( Academy of Arts and Sciences , 1999 ) .
The United States Government also concurs with the scientists , politicians and authors thus far noted , albeit in a more subdued , but equally certain stance .
A Congressional Office of Technology Assessment ( OTA ) study conducted in 1993 ascertained that one hundred kilograms , or a mere two hundred and twenty pounds of anthrax could under optimal conditions , kill as many as three million residents of Washington D.C ( Office of Technology Assessment , United States Congress .
1993 ) In academic circles , the word " optimal " might stand out as a word reducing the true significance of the potential anthrax represents to Americans , but if one considers a reduction in the efficacy of said biological agent , and perhaps investigates a sub- optimal release with only a three or four percent total potential , then one must still grasp the fact that 90,000 to 120,000 people would still die .
2 . In contrast to the killing capacity to weight ratio of anthrax , Peter Burgasov , former Chief Sanitary Physician of the Soviet Union , admitted to the Courier , a Russian newspaper in November 2001 , that the Soviet Union had been testing smallpox as a weapon since at least the 1970's and described one particularly disturbing test conducted on an island in the Aral Sea " A research ship of the Aral fleet came within 15 kilometers away from the island ( it was forbidden to come any closer than 40 kilometers )
The lab technician of this ship took samples of plankton twice a day from the top deck .
The smallpox formulation - 400 grams of which was exploded on the island - " got her " - and she became infected . "
( House International Relations Committee , on Bioterrorism , 2001 ) .
The aforementioned OTA study focuses on what is to be expected immediately after an attack , and does not take into account the fact that anthrax spores will continue to represent a viable threat for decades as it would thoroughly contaminate the soil , and leave the entire area under quarantine for generations .
An example of anthrax 's longevity can be seen even today , from afar , on the Island of Gruinard off the coast of Scotland .
The British conducted experiments with anthrax there during World War Two , and the entire area has been closed to the public since , and more than five decades later still represents a threat to human life despite the fact that the British government has attempted in every scientific way to make the area safe ( Hersh , 1968 ; Alibek , 1999 ) .
3 . A former top - level Soviet scientist involved at the highest echelons with research on biological agents named Ken Alibek discloses in detail an incident that occurred in Sverdlovsk Russia in the late 1970s .
Much of the incident was known about already through an investigation conducted by U.S. analysts , but the full details were not known until Alibek defected to the United States and told the entire story .
In March 1979 , a Soviet technician accidentally forgot to replace a vital filter in the anthrax production facilities ventilation system resulting in a release of anthrax into the surrounding community .
Dozens of people died , a local communist party chief immediately ordered a cleanup , which disturbed the already settled anthrax spores , and re-infected people through secondary aerosols ( Alibek , 1999 ) .
Predictably , the Soviet government initiated a cover- up , and all the facts were n't known until 1993 .
The American Defense Intelligence Agency published a report in 1986 outlining what it knew about the accident at Sverdlovsk , and pointed out some significant facts about the attempts on the part of the Soviet government to decontaminate the area after the exposure .
Incidentally , the Defense Intelligence Agency also emphasizes the fact that only twenty - two pounds , approximately ten kilograms was accidentally dispersed into the atmosphere .
The following observations were noted in the report , demonstrating the fact that decontaminating an area contaminated by anthrax spores is difficult at best , and impossible overall ( Defense Intelligence Agency report : 1986 , Pp , 4 - 7 ) . · Initial disinfection and decontamination procedures were largely ineffective . ·
The extraordinary efforts to clean up were inconsistent with the Soviet explanation . ·
The reported aerial spraying activity and disinfection with steam and hypochlorite , a bleach solution around the military installation are clear attempts to decontaminate areas affected by infectious aerosol .
4 . Expert opinion on the need for a large infrastructure and bio-agent production Osterholm and Schwartz ( 2000 ) argues that a fairly remedial background in biology is all that is necessary to produce significant quantities of anthrax in one 's basement , completely countering the Federal Bureau of Investigations contention , as emphasized by the media , that a massive infrastructure , knowledge , scientific , and economic resources are necessary .
An example of this belief can be found in the following article , alongside a most erroneous statement suggestive of the fact that the authors had n't done their homework .
" Militarized anthrax spores are so difficult to manufacture that only a handful of countries with large military - industrial establishments have ever developed the capacity " ( Department of Health and Human Services , 2000 ) .
" There has never been a confirmed use of anthrax spores , anywhere , by anyone , in a military or terrorist attack " ( Department of Health and Human Services , 2000 ) .
This report was indeed written prior to the anthrax letters to Daschle and various media representatives , but it was written more than fifty - years after known Japanese military use of anthrax in Manchuria during World War Two ( Eitzen & Takafuji , 1997 ) .
The Japanese use of biological agents in warfare was cited by Osterholm and Schwartz ( 2000 , p. 70 ) , Alibek ( 1999 , p. 36-37 ) , and Hersh ( 1968 , p. 12-18 ) .
In short , it was a fairly well known fact , and should not have been missed by the Department of Health and Human Services .
The idea that bacterial growth and dissemination requires advanced technology and / or weapon systems is equally nonsensical , and is dismissed by Osterholm and Schwartz as well as other experts within the pages of their book on the topic ( 2000 , p.112-117 ) .
" One government analyst some years ago determined that $ 1,500 of nuclear killing power would set an anthrax assailant back by only a penny " ( Osterholm & Schwartz , 2000 , p. 8 ) .
Leonard Cole ( 1988 ) supports this by citing expert information provided to the United Nations in 1969 stating that a square kilometer of ground costs approx $ 2000 to take with conventional weapons , $ 800 with nuclear , $ 600 with nerve agent , and a single dollar with Biological agents .
This would seem to cast some doubt on the governments position that a large economic base is essential , thus effectively ruling out a rogue individual , or loose knit terrorist organization .
In fact , one encounters the experts differing from this line of thinking all together .
Kenneth Alibek stated clearly on October 24th , 2001 , in response to the question , " is anthrax really that hard to get your hands on , " " In my opinion , it 's not very hard " ( The Money Gang , October 24th ) .
In another televised interview Alibek detailed the fact that there is an island in the Aral Sea completely contaminated with anthrax spores , and that if anyone wanted to acquire them , there were no guards , and that " it would n't be a big problem . "
The former Soviet scientist added the fact that the anthrax spores that could be found on this island were also genetically engineered , making them antibiotic resistant ( 48 Hours , 2001 , October 19th ) .
5 . Where would one acquire anthrax if so inspired ?
Prior to the recent terrorist attack associated with the anthrax letters sent to Daschle and various media figures , one could actually order it from labs across the country .
It was in this manner that a gentleman named Larry Wayne Harris , associated with fringe elements in the political arena , acquired both plague samples and anthrax samples .
He was dismissed as a threat by the government when this fact was exposed , because it was said that the strains he obtained were n't exceedingly virulent ( Osterholm & Schwartz , 2000 ) .
Perhaps the government wished to get the case out of the public 's mind as quickly as possible because Harris obtained the plague samples through the mail simply by writing to the American Type Culture Collection ( ATCC ) and requesting it .
Essentially , luck played a role in his capture , and law enforcement officials were able to confiscate the bubonic plague sample from his glove compartment .
According to congressional testimony provided by Representative John R , Kasich " what he ( Larry Harris ) did was not a crime , " and at least in 1996 , " the law currently treats the improper disposal of motor oil by a service station more severely than what Harris did " ( Senate Committee on the Judiciary , 1996 , March 6 ) .
Harris is not the only example of someone acquiring lethal biological agents through the ATCC .
Iraq also acquired their anthrax by mailing requests to the ATCC , as did a religious cult in Oregon who used their easily acquired bacteria to infect the town of The Dalles , in Oregon with a strain of salmonella in the 1980s ( Miller , Engelberg , & Broad , 2001 ) .
When one considers these disturbing facts , one might conclude that perhaps the government , its analysts and experts have forgotten that bacteria 's primary mission is to grow , and in anthrax 's case encapsulate itself indefinitely when the environment proves too hostile to proliferate .
Another unique quality , perhaps forgotten by the government , is bacteria 's ability to mutate , and in many cases this mutation can be easily manipulated by using animals as incubators .
Progress on the phenomena associated with mutations and bacteria was well developed by 1968 , allowing for an increase in virulence , longevity , resistance , and a variety of other adaptations ( Hersh , 1968 ) .
By the early 1980s , mutation and DNA recombinant techniques had reached a point where at least one ( Harris , 1982 ) author felt that " ethnic germs " or ethnically selective bacteria might be a possibility .
Additionally , genetically engineered viruses affecting the way an immune system responds to infection were thought to also be under research .
The author also asserts that such a germ may already have been developed by 1982 ( Harris , 1982 ) .
Joshua Lederberg , a Nobel Laureate , Professor , and pioneer in the fields of genetic exchanges in bacteria , and microbial genetics also acknowledges the theoretical likelihood that " ethnic germs " are on the horizon ( Miller , et all , 2001 ) .
Alibek ( 1999 ) details the fact that an accidental release of anthrax into a city sewer system in the Soviet Union exposed rats to anthrax , killing them .
However , before they died some of the rats unwittingly participated in an incubation process that increased the virulence of the original strain .
Soviet scientists proceeded to weaponize the new deadlier strain , calling it anthrax 836 .
6 . The Federal Government admitted in a study conducted in the 1960s , that biological warfare scientists concluded that an , " Attack with disease was possible , indeed terrifyingly simple " .
They further concluded that the United States was , " Highly Vulnerable , " to a germ warfare attack ( Harris , 1982 ) .
Nearly forty years later , little has changed .
The government is still unprepared to meet the challenges associated with a biological attack .
In 1960 " the head of the Army Chemical Corp warned congress that a potential enemy could perhaps kill or perhaps seriously disable 30 percent of the American population by mounting a biological warfare attack with ten aircraft " ( Hersh , 1968 , Pp. 68 ) .
The author Richard McCarthy also emphasized the fact that the American government had " no defense " against biological warfare in 1969 ( McCarthy , 1967 ) .
In a Center For Civilian Biodefense Strategies ( CCBS ) report , the center revealed , " there are currently no atmospheric warning systems to detect an aerosol cloud of anthrax spores .
The first sign of a bioterrorist attack would most likely be patients presenting with symptoms of inhalation anthrax " ( CCBS , 2000 ) .
According to the same CCBS report , those presenting with symptoms of inhalation anthrax are most likely to die , reinforcing the fact that those who have developed symptoms will in ninety percent of cases expire .
Additionally , the report then acknowledges a little known fact , " U.S. vaccine supplies are limited and U.S. production capacity is modest .
There is no vaccine available for civilian use " ( CCBS , 2000 ) .
7 . In fact , the United States Government should be exceedingly familiar with many scenarios involving biological agents , and possible consequences , perhaps more so than any other nation in the world .
The U.S. government has sanctioned the exposure of its own population to various , allegedly benign , bacterial agents including serratia marcens , and bacillus subtilus .
In the end these agents were n't entirely benign , and caused the deaths of American citizens submitted involuntarily to experiments conducted without their consent or knowledge ( Cole , 1988 ) .
As recently as 1996 the integrity and honesty of the United States government was called into question concerning American soldiers that had developed symptoms during the Gulf War that could not be explained .
Patrick Eddington , a one - time CIA analyst , allegedly was fired by the agency for claiming it was covering up the fact that the Iraqis had actually used chemical weapons on U.S. soldiers during the war .
David Martin , a CBS reporter , interviewed Eddington asking him , " Would you call it a cover up ? "
Eddington responds by saying , " yes , I would describe that as a cover up . "
Eddington then concludes the interview by stating , " the culture of the CIA is one that does not really welcome those who rock the boat , who question prevailing assessments , who question prevailing views " ( CBS Evening News , 1996 , October 30 ) .
Two days later , the CIA came out with its official response to Eddington 's accusations , stating in effect that the agency " continued to conclude that Iraq did not use chemical or biological agents during the Gulf War " ( Slatkin , 1996 , November 1 ) .
8 . The U.S. Army did subject the New York City population to an experiment in the 1960s concerned with measuring " saturation rates , " or the amount of bacteria one would inhale at certain times , and in specific locations after the initial release .
Light bulbs containing eighty - seven trillion bacilli each were dropped onto ventilation grates above the New York City subway system .
It was deduced that within minutes exposed individuals were inhaling a million bacilli per minute , and were entirely unaware of it .
Additionally , the subway trains created a vacuum of sorts that conveniently spread the bacilli throughout the system with little effort ( Cole , 1988 ) .
The implications of the New York subway system experiments are truly horrific .
People breathing in a million bacilli per minute were not aware of it in any way .
If government reports are accurate concerning the lethal dose of anthrax being in the neighborhood of eight thousand spores in total , which incidentally is in dispute in some scientific circles , then one might conclude that anthrax represents a serious threat today .
Bacillus subtilus is similar to anthrax in that it is a sporalating gram - positive rod bacterium , and aerosolizes , as would anthrax .
If a light bulb can contain eighty - seven trillion bacilli , if filled with anthrax it would represent enough to kill the entire human population on terra firma more than twice over , with approximately 10,875,000,000 individual lethal doses , with eight thousand spores representing a lethal dose .
This fact becomes especially frightening when one considers the Soviet Union always maintained a stockpile of hundreds of tons of anthrax at all times .
In fact , according to Ken Alibek ( 1999 ) anthrax production at one facility alone could be as much as 500 - 600 kilograms daily .
9 . One of the more frightening scenarios encountered in the research of this thesis was whether or not anthrax could be passed through currency .
Certainly everyone is now familiar with the fact that it traveled rather nicely inside envelopes .
On the issue of whether or not anthrax can be carried on currency , there is a great deal of contention among different sources .
Ted Koppel admitted on Nightline , " the possibility is scaring me to death .
Please tell me it 's not possible . "
In response to Koppel 's concerns the Department of Health and Human Services replied , " highly unlikely , " " highly improbable , " " almost impossible . "
The Treasury Department , in their apparent expertise , stated that , " there is no way to embed anthrax in the currency " ( Nightline , 2001 , October 17 ) .
Oddly enough a study conducted in 1972 and reported in a Discover magazine article determined that staphylococci , micrococci , diptheroids , and propriobacteria , were present and viable on randomly tested bills of various denominations ( Discover , 1998 ) .
A second study conducted in 1997 found that 3 % of coins , and 11 % of all bills tested were positive for bacteria .
In 1998 , another study conducted by the University of California at San Francisco found in 113 examples of currency samples that most of the bills grew " harmless bacteria " but 18 % of coins , and 7 % of bills manifested pathogenic bacteria , including E - Coli , and Staphylococcus Aureus ( Discover , 1998 ) .
Shirley Lowe , a microbiologist credited with conducting the study on behalf of the University stated that " half the money , " she obtained from a doughnut shop grew Staphylococcus Aureus ( Discover , 1998 ) .
I think the gist of this article , Filthy Lucre , is that money , especially currency with its 75 % cotton , 25 % linen composition is a more than suitable vector for bacteria .
Also mentioned in the same article was the fact that bacteria can't live on the dry acidic surface of money forever , as it requires a moist warm environment to grow .
This is very true with most bacteria , but untrue in respect to anthrax spores , as the spores themselves are nearly impervious to the environment , and when introduced into a receptive environment , will then proliferate .
Possibly the most significant aspect of this entire article devoted to money is not the revelation that bacteria can survive on currency , but that cocaine hydrochloride was known to cross -contaminate currency at the counting - sorting machines used in banks and at the Federal Reserve as early as 1997 .
The article Filthy Lucre proceeds to mention that a study conducted at the Houston Advanced Research Center in Texas found that 70 - 80 % of all currency had trace amounts of cocaine hydrochloride on them .
In older bills that had been in circulation for some time , 90 % had cocaine traces ( p.82 ) .
The Journal of Forensic Sciences conducted a study in May 1998 that concluded that more than 93 % of all bills tested had trace amounts of cocaine hydrochloride present .
In 1997 Tom Jourdan , chief of the Materials and Devices unit at the FBI lab in Washington D.C. found that 90 % of bills tested were positive for cocaine .
Tom Jourdan stated that it is his belief that " mechanical currency counters are homogenizing money . "
According to Jourdan , " one contaminated bill brushed through the counting machine at the bank can contaminate the entire stack " ( p.84 ) .
The last paragraph in the article Filthy Lucre states exactly , " So money is n't exactly squeaky clean .
But it is n't exactly going to do us in either .
If there 's a lesson here , it is that money reflects whatever activity , and mischief , that human hands get up to - and the activity and occasional mischief of all the microscopic organisms along for the ride on our skin " ( pg 84 ) .
This last statement could prove to be more prophetic than the author ever intended , with the exception of the " is n't exactly going to do us in " part , which may prove one day to be overly optimistic .
It would certainly seem feasible that if cocaine hydrochloride could " homogenize " money , then anthrax ought to be able to as well .
Perhaps the greater concern here is not the possibility that anthrax can cross - contaminate money , but that the FBI was apparently unable to deduce the commonalities between currency , and envelopes .
On very short notice I was called today by KTVU ( Fox TV Bay Area )
for an interview about state voter registration database " fatal pending " errors and implications for the Feb. 6 primary election .
KTVU is pooling their coverage of this topic sister station ( and Fox affiliate ) KTTV Channel 11 in Los Angeles , and the story airs in both metro areas this evening .
In the Bay Area , KTVU ( Ch. 2 ) will air a brief , initial version of the story at 6:00 pm tonight , followed by a more detailed version on the 10:00 pm edition .
The same is likely on the LA station .
The story arose because the KTVU reporter Roland De Wolk discovered by accident that his own name is on the " fatal pending " list -- even though he knows for a fact he is ( or ought to be ) registered .
" Fatal pending " is the term of art for a voter registration record that has been tagged by a county or state - - rightly or wrongly -- as invalid , meaning that any voter so labeled will be regarded as ineligible to cast a vote .
Voters whose records are tagged as " fatal pending " will not be mailed a sample ballot or any poll location directions , and their name will not appear in the voter registration book in the precinct on election day .
De Wolk 's initial investigations show that there are 26,500 fatal pendings in LA County , 1,700 in Alameda Co. , 2,300 in Solano Co. -- and although De Wolk has not completed a survey of all 58 counties , it appears there are at least 30,000 fatal pendings with three business days remaining to election day .
It will be interesting to see how the 26,500 fatal pendings are glossed in LA , where the news source interviewed for this story by KTTV was none other than Acting Registrar of Voters Dean Logan , former registrar Conny McCormack 's handpicked successor .
( You can read more about Mr. Logan 's job qualifications here : http://www.protectcaliforniaballots.org/Documents/DeanLogan01.htm ) .
It appears that some counties are doing much better at checking the rolls and notifying voters .
Contra Costa reports they are down to just 3 fatal pendings , and Sonoma County reports zero .
Guidelines for implementing the state voter database say that election officials are supposed to attempt to notify voters identified for purging by phone or mail in sufficient time to enable voters to correct possible errors .
The most recent statement of voter database implementation procedures that reporter De Wolk could locate were labeled as interm woking papers dated May , 2007 .
It 's unclear at this writing whether a fatal pending error on the part of the state is a recoverable error for a victimized voter .
The deadline to register to vote in the California February 5th primary was midnight on January 22 .
" If a voter 's name does not appear on the election roster at his or her polling place location , the person will be required to show proof of current residence in order to receive a provisional ballot .
Ballots for such voters are placed in provisional ballot envelopes .
Each provisional ballot is researched by election officials .
A provisional ballot is not counted unless the Elections Official establishes from the records in their office the claimants ' right to vote prior to the completion of the official canvass , or by order of the Superior Court in the county of the voter 's residence . "
It would seem that the onus is on the voter to prove they 've been wrongly purged from the voter rolls , but it 's not clear whether there 's enough time to effect this correction before the close of the election canvas period .
The status , standards , and procedures of the statewide central voter databases mandated by HAVA are probably the least known aspect of the voting process .
Even in California , which provides generally excellent public voting information compared to most states , the most current information the reporter was able to obtain about voter database correction procedure , was an interim report in progress dated May 2007 .
The most comprehensive study to date on the subject of the centralized state voter database requirements imposed by HAVA ( the " Help America Vote Act " of 2002 ) was issued more than a year ago and based on 2005 survey data .
That study , called " Making the List " was produced by the Brennan Center of New York University .
The Brennan summary report is available for download at the EDA website : http://www.electiondefensealliance.org/centralized_voter_registration_databases
Individual state reports from the Brennan study can be found in the individual state folders grouped in the 50 States Directory at

The best advice for voters ?
Take nothing for granted .
Phone your county elections department and demand to know whether you are listed on the voting rolls for the primary election .
Election day is too late to find out that you 're not .
Oh -- and take photo ID with you to the polls , if you have it -- or a current utility bill or bank statement with your name and address printed , or some form of government - issued ID .
Thanks to technological advances , your right to vote is more in question than ever .

Barack Obama is to mount the biggest advertising blitz of the presidential campaign this weekend ahead of Tuesday 's Pennsylvania primary in an attempt to force Hillary Clinton out of the race .
With pressure mounting among senior Democratic figures to bring the contest to an early close , Clinton needs a large margin of victory in Tuesday 's primary just to stay in the race .
Obama is hoping to deliver a knock - out blow by outspending her in advertising .
Obama , with tens of millions at his disposal from fundraising , is planning to spend well over $ 2 m in ads in the run-up to the primary , at least twice as much as the cash - strapped Clinton campaign .
In Philadelphia , which could determine the outcome , he reserved for the final days $ 465,000 worth of television and radio spots while Clinton reserved only $ 91,000 .
Obama 's strategy – which he has deployed time and again during his political career – is that the more money spent on advertising , the higher the odds of winning an election .
Clinton , who , like Obama , is criss - crossing the state tomorrow , Sunday and Monday , needs to beat Obama by more than 10 % of the vote to head off calls from senior Democrats to withdraw .
The latest poll , by Zogby , puts Clinton on 47 % to Obama 's 43 % .
While the polls throughout the primary season have been notoriously unreliable , the pattern of the polls over the last few weeks have consistently shown a shrinking of Clinton 's once formidable double - digit lead .
The Democratic chairman , Howard Dean , reflecting concern within the party that the bickering between Clinton and Obama could damage the party 's chances in the November general election , signalled again that he would like to see an early end to the contest .
He told CNN yesterday he needed the superdelegates - members of Congress and other senior Democrats who hold the balance of power - to declare as a matter of urgency which of the two they support .
" I need them to say who they 're for starting now , " he said .
" We can not give up two or three months of active campaigning and healing time .
We 've got to know who our nominee is . "
Obama is so far ahead that it is near impossible for Clinton to catch him in the remaining eight contests after Pennsylvania , beginning with North Carolina and Indiana on May 6 and ending with Montana and South Dakota on June 3 .
Obama leads Clinton in the overall delegate count , 1,645 to 1,504 .
Clinton has a slight edge in superdelegates , with 248 backing her compared with 226 for Obama , but since March 3 , he has gained 80 and she has added only five .
Obama has lost some momentum in recent weeks , forced on the defensive by an aggressive Clinton team and his dismissive ' bitter ' comment about small - town residents that has hurt his campaign .
He emerged battered from a debate with her in Philadelphia on Wednesday night and today hinted he may not , after all , take part in the next debate with her , planned for Raleigh , North Carolina , on April 27 .
" I 'll be honest with you , we 've now had 21 ( debates ) , " he said .
" It 's not as if we do n't know how to do these things .
I could deliver Senator Clinton 's lines ; she could , I 'm sure , deliver mine . "
Clinton had formally agreed to participate in the North Carolina debate but Obama has still to accept .
Obama complained that the first 45 minutes of the Philadelphia debate was devoted to negative questions and comments directed against him from Clinton and the television moderators .
Clinton , interviewed by a Fox television affiliate in Philadelphia today , accused him of running away .
" We need a president who is going to be up there fighting everyday for the American people and not complain about how much pressure there is , and how hard the questions are , " she said .
LOS ANGELES - Ana Puente was an infant with a liver disorder when her aunt brought her illegally to the United States to seek medical care .
She underwent two liver transplants at the University of California , Los Angeles Medical Center as a child in 1989 and a third in 1998 , each paid for by the state .
But when Puente turned 21 in June , she aged out of her state - funded health insurance and the ability to continue treatment at UCLA .
This year , her liver began failing again and she was hospitalized at County - USC Medical Center , affiliated with the University of Southern California .
In her Medi-Cal application , a USC doctor wrote , " Her current clinical course is irreversible , progressive and will lead to death without another liver transplant . "
The application was denied .
The county gave her medication but does not have the resources to perform transplants .
Late last month Puente learned of another , little - known option for patients with certain healthcare needs .
If she notified US Citizenship and Immigration Services that she was in the country illegally , state health officials might grant her full coverage through Medi-Cal , the state health services assistance program for the poor .
Puente did so , her benefits were restored , and she is awaiting a fourth transplant at UCLA .
Puente 's case highlights two controversial issues :
Should illegal immigrants receive liver transplants in the United States and should taxpayers pick up the cost ?
The average cost of a liver transplant and first - year follow - up is nearly $ 490,000 , according to the United Network for Organ Sharing .
Donor livers are in scarce supply .
In California , nearly 3,700 people are on a waiting list for livers , according to the network .
Last year , more than 90 percent were given to US citizens .
Donor livers generally are allocated through a geographic - based distribution system on the basis of how sick the patients are and how long they have been on the transplant waiting list .
Immigration status does not play a role in allocating organs .
But some people say that it should .
" All transplants are about rationing , " said Roy Beck , executive director of NumbersUSA , which favors stricter controls on immigration .
" I just do n't think the public ought to be funding any kind of benefits for people who are breaking the law . "
Larry Gonzalez , a US citizen who has hepatitis C , has known for a decade that he needs a new liver but was placed on the transplant waiting list only last week .
" Why do we have to get in line behind immigrants , foreigners , when we have enough people here to fill the hospitals ? " said Gonzalez , 54 , who lives in Ventura .
But Dr. Michael Shapiro , vice chairman of the ethics committee for the organ sharing network , said illegal immigrants have just as much right to receive organ transplants as US citizens .
He said it is likely that more illegal immigrants donate organs than receive them .
" People are people , and when you make an incision in an organ donor , you do n't find little American flags planted on their organs , " Shapiro said .
Illegal immigrant children with certain severe , chronic illnesses are eligible for funding under a state program .
But the coverage ends when they turn 21 .
State health officials said California law is designed so there is no gap in coverage , so children move seamlessly from state - funded treatment to county care .
But that does n't always happen .
When they become adults , patients like Puente often must switch doctors and hospitals and might lose access to necessary medical care .
That break can be life - threatening .
" It does n't matter if I 'm undocumented , " Puente said .
" They should take care of me at UCLA for the rest of my life because I 've been there since I was a baby . "

O.K. , here it comes :
The unthinkable is about to become the inevitable .
Last week , Robert Rubin , the former Treasury secretary , and John Lipsky , a top official at the International Monetary Fund , both suggested that public funds might be needed to rescue the U.S. financial system .
Mr. Lipsky insisted that he was n’t talking about a bailout .
But he was .
It ’s true that Henry Paulson , the current Treasury secretary , still says that any proposal to use taxpayers ’ money to help resolve the crisis is a “ non-starter . ”
But that ’s about as credible as all of his previous pronouncements on the financial situation .
So here ’s the question we really should be asking :
When the feds do bail out the financial system , what will they do to ensure that they are n’t also bailing out the people who got us into this mess ?
Let ’s talk about why a bailout is inevitable .
Between 2002 and 2007 , false beliefs in the private sector  the belief that home prices only go up , that financial innovation had made risk go away , that a triple - A rating really meant that an investment was safe  led to an epidemic of bad lending .
Meanwhile , false beliefs in the political arena  the belief of Alan Greenspan and his friends in the Bush administration that the market is always right and regulation always a bad thing  led Washington to ignore the warning signs .

Iraqis hold a banner of radical cleric Moqtada Sadr during a massive protest in Baghdad
Amateur footage A curfew has been imposed on Baghdad amid continuing clashes between Shia militias and Iraqi security forces .
The curfew will last from 2300 ( 2000 GMT ) on Thursday until 0500 on Sunday to " protect civilians " , officials say .
More than 130 people have died since a clampdown on Shia militias in the southern city of Basra started on Tuesday .
Unrest has spread to Baghdad .
Earlier US President George W Bush praised Iraqi PM Nouri Maliki 's decision to order the crackdown .
Heavy fighting between the Shia Mehdi Army , led by radical Shia cleric Moqtada Sadr , has continued in Basra for a third day , with violence in other parts of southern Iraq .
Late on Thursday , Sadr called for a political solution to the crisis .
In a statement relayed by his aide Hazem al - Aaraji , he said he wants " everyone to pursue political solutions and peaceful protests and a stop to the shedding of Iraqi blood " .
Mr Maliki earlier vowed that he would continue the fight against the militias for as long as was necessary .
" We have made up our minds to enter this battle and we will continue until the end .
No retreat , " Mr Maliki said in a speech broadcast on Iraqi state television .
Thousands in Baghdad demanded the Iraqi PM quit
Enlarge Image
The prime minister has personally overseen the operation in Basra , which involves some 30,000 troops and police .
But Mehdi Army fighters remain in control of some densely - populated areas .
Speaking at a US Air Force museum in Dayton , Ohio , Mr Bush said " normalcy " was returning to Iraq .
" As we speak Iraqis are waging a tough battle against militia fighters and criminals in Basra , many of whom have received arms and training and funding from Iran , " he said .
Mr Maliki 's move against Basra 's militias underlined " his leadership and his commitment to enforce the law in an even - handed manner " , the US president added .
Rising violence
He spoke as one of several Americans injured this week in rocket attacks on Baghdad 's Green Zone died , amid fresh missiles attacks on the fortified area .
US embassy staff in Baghdad have been told not to leave reinforced structures , following the attacks .
The state department has instructed embassy personnel to wear helmets and other protective gear if they leave the building , even if they stay within the Green Zone .
Meanwhile , one of Iraq 's two main oil export pipelines from Basra was blown up in a bomb attack , sending oil prices above $ 107 a barrel .
And Basra 's police chief survived a bomb attack that killed three of his bodyguards .
BASRA KEY FACTS
Third largest city , population 2.6 million approx Located on the Shatt al - Arab waterway leading to the Gulf Region around city has substantial oil resources 4,000 UK troops based at international airport
Battles threaten fragile Iraq Clashes in pictures Oil soars above $ 107 Invasion right , says Bush With many shops and markets shut , residents in the city said they were beginning to run out of food and water .
In Baghdad , thousands of Sadr supporters marched to demand Mr Maliki quit over the Basra operation and there was sporadic fighting in Shia areas of the capital .
In other developments :
The FBI said it had recovered the bodies of two US security contractors kidnapped in Iraq in 2006
A prominent Sunni civilian spokesman for the Baghdad security plan , Tahseen Sheikhly , was kidnapped by gunmen
Dozens died in clashes between the security forces and militias in the southern city of Kut
Clashes have also been reported in the towns of Hilla and Diwaniya , as well as the Shia holy city of Kerbala
The number of gunfights in southern Iraq appears to be growing , says the BBC's Crispin Thorold in Baghdad .
The fighting still seems to be mainly with members of the Mehdi Army , our correspondent says .
The militia had held to a ceasefire since last August , contributing to the general fall in violence across Iraq .
The government says it aims to re-impose law and order in Basra , which the British military handed over to Iraqi forces in December .
However , Moqtada Sadr 's supporters say the government wants to weaken the militias before local elections in October .
At stake , analysts say , is control of Iraq 's only port city and the region 's oil fields .

If you took a psychology class in college , you may have run across the so - called “ Hawthorne Effect , ” which is discussed in many college textbooks ( see page 31 of this extensive survey from 2004 ) and is still cited in various studies .
But the original studies that gave the “ Hawthorne Effect ” its name have long been discredited , and textbooks do n’t always give you the full details .
First , a quick definition of the “ Hawthorne Effect ” from Wikipedia :
The term gets its name from a factory called the Hawthorne Works , where a series of experiments on factory workers were carried out between 1924 and 1932 .
There were many types of experiments conducted on the employees , but the purpose of the original ones was to study the effect of lighting on workers ’ productivity .
Researchers found that productivity almost always increased after a change in illumination but later returned to normal levels .
This effect was observed for minute increases in illumination .
. . .
A second set of experiments began and were supervised by Harvard University professors Elton Mayo , Fritz Roethlisberger and William J. Dickson .
They experimented on other types of changes in the working environment , using a study group of five young women .
Again , no matter the change in conditions , the women nearly always produced more .
The researchers reported that they had accidentally found a way to increase productivity .
But is the original research valid ?
Does it really prove that workers improve their productivity no matter what changes are made to their environment , or — more broadly — that people tend to improve their performance with any change that is being studied ?
No .
As a 1998 New York Times article pointed out , “ only five workers took part in the study , . . . and two were replaced partway through for gross insubordination and low output . ”
In addition to the extremely small sample size and attrition , there are two additional problems : 1 ) the group ’s performance did n’t even always increase , and 2 ) there were many confounding variables , such as the use of incentive pay (! ) and rest breaks .
In short , as this 1992 article from the American Journal of Sociology pointed out , the original data show “ slender or no evidence of a Hawthorne effect . ”
Even so , psychology textbooks still seem to get many of these details wrong .
For example , many textbooks suggest incorrectly that the workers ’ performance consistently improved in the Hawthorne studies .
As the textbook survey notes , “ Contrary to the assertions of the authors of 76 % of the textbooks in our sample ( f = 16 ) , performance did not always increase in the illumination studies . ”
Many textbooks also fail to discuss attrition or confounding variables :
Excessive focus upon lighting manipulations can obfuscate other relevant independent variable manipulations made by Hawthorne researchers , including duration of rest and lunch breaks , length of work day , and the type of incentive pay .
Rest breaks were a primary independent variable in the [ first ] experiment but were only discussed in 13 of the 21 books in our sample .
Incentive pay was rarely discussed in our sample of textbooks ( f = 5 ) as an intentionally manipulated independent variable at Hawthorne .
. . .
Many students would be surprised to learn these facts and that participants ’ in the [ first ] experiment ranked “ earnings ” among the top three reasons why they preferred the test room over regular working conditions .
* * * [ I ]t was discouraging that references to other confounding variables within the environmental type were comparatively rare .
As previously mentioned , changes in incentive pay during the [ first ] experiment were mentioned in only five textbooks .
The fact that 2 of the 5 participants in the [ first ] study were replaced several months into the [ first ] experiment was mentioned only once .
Changes in the quality and quantity of performance feedback during the same experiment were also mentioned only once in the sample .
The phrase “ too good to check ” seems to apply to more than journalism .
A few thoughts that come to mind :
First , out of the three following categories of studies , which do you suppose would be most susceptible to this sort of propagation ?
1. Studies purporting to prove something that is totally obvious ;
2. Studies purporting to prove something that is surprising at first but that has a plausible explanation ; or
3. Studies purporting to prove something that is both surprising and implausible .
Second , I ’m not denying that there may be a real “ Hawthorne Effect ” of a more limited sort , in the sense that when people know they ’re being watched and studied , they may alter their behavior in any number of ways .
See , e.g. , here or here .
Still , that ’s not the same as saying that “ any change can cause an improvement , ” which is how the “ Hawthorne ” experiments are sometimes misinterpreted .
Third , to the extent that people do alter their behavior just in response to being studied , what then ?
Do we think that such behavioral alterations will be random and thus wash out ?
Or will they be tilted in a particular direction ( depending on the field and on what question is being studied ) , thus affecting the overall results of a given study ?
And what does this tell us about Institutional Review Boards and their insistence that subjects should provide informed consent for anything and everything ?

This week , while Ross is in the mountains of Mexico training for his new role as a Cracked columnist , we 're counting down our favorite Nooners from five to one .
Coming in at number four is a post that probably marks the closest the Cracked Blog has ever come to starting an international incident .
The comic shown fondling a child in the clip issued this poorly translated statement a day after Ross 's post went popular on Digg .

Either way , this video is creepy .
I 've traveled extensively through Eastern Europe , and I 've noticed that the people there are really eager to share their customs with outsiders .
Whether it 's the proper way to take a shot of the local liquor without going blind , the etiquette of bribing a local police officer to get your wallet back , or the cheapest way to transport your new and lovely bride back to America ( cargo ship ) , the charming local people of Eastern Europe are only too happy to help .
But this kindness extends to more than just basics like alcohol , police corruption and the flesh trade .
If there 's one thing I 've learned , it 's that Eastern Europeans will go out of their way to explain a joke to complete strangers - even , as luck would have it , if that stranger is wearing a fanny pack and a " These Colors Don't Run " t- shirt .
Eastern Europeans have a strange sense of humor , but they 're usually more than willing to let you in on the joke .
For example , one time I was in Estonia and decided to go see some live theater .
During the play , a small boy walked out onto the stage , and all the other thespians ( full - grown men ) crowded around him and started poking him with long staffs while giggling like little schoolchildren .
Baffled , I turned to a woman next to me and asked her what it was all about .
As luck would have it , she spoke English .
" The boy , " she explained , " represents Estonia , and the men around him represent the encroaching influence of Russian culture . "
That made sense so I left it at that .
Then I left during intermission and vowed to never go see theater in Estonia again .
Another time I was in a small town in the Prekmurje region of Slovenia , and there was a crowd gathered around a man performing in the town square .
Draped in chainmail and furs , he sang an upbeat song and danced around a bit .
Then he asked for a volunteer from the crowd , and a young boy stepped forward to applause .
The man went on singing his song and dancing about , and then he put his hand down the boy 's pants and the entire crowd burst into laughter .
Horrified , I turned to an older woman next to me and asked , " What 's the joke there ? "
As luck would have it , the woman spoke English ( what are the odds in Prekmurje ? ! ) .
" The man represents the Ostrogoths who once pillaged our land . "
" And the boy ? ! " I asked .
" What does he represent ? " " The land , " she said .
I guess the moral of the story is " Eastern Europeans like political humor . "
THE RACE FOR DELEGATES THE RACE FOR DELEGATES USA TODAY 's interactive delegate tracker shows where the presidential candidates stand as they seek their party 's nomination .
AUSTIN ( AP ) 
The Texas Democratic Party said Monday it wo n't grant a request from Hillary Rodham Clinton 's campaign that it take extra steps to verify the signatures of election night caucus - goers before party conventions are held March 29 .
State chairman Boyd Richie said Texas Democrats will not " set up an unnecessary , ad hoc ' verification ' process that could effectively disqualify delegates selected at their precinct conventions after the fact . "
An estimated 1 million people attended Democratic caucuses after the party 's primary concluded March 4 .
Those caucuses began the selection of 67 pledged presidential delegates .
Clinton 's campaign said in a letter to the state party Friday it wanted the signatures of those attending caucuses double - checked before county and senate district conventions convene later this month .
But Richie said the party conventions already have credentials rules in place to address complaints and problems .
The Clinton campaign said it received more than 2,000 complaints of violations following the historic Texas turnout and that it is the party 's responsibility to ensure the integrity of the caucus process .
Among the problems cited were caucuses starting before precinct polling places closed and results being taken from head or hand counts instead of a written roll .
In an unofficial and incomplete caucus tally , the state Democratic Party reported Barack Obama was ahead of Clinton with 56 % to her 44 % after 41 % of precinct caucuses reported .
Clinton narrowly won the primary stage of the contest earlier in the day , which allocated 126 delegates .
Clinton 's campaign did not immediately comment on Monday 's decision by the party .
Obama spokesman Josh Earnest said : " Our campaign agrees that the best way to capitalize on the incredible enthusiasm and hundreds of thousands of new voters who participated in the precinct conventions on March 4th is to count their votes promptly and accurately .
We look forward to continuing to work with the Texas Democratic Party to ensure that happens . "
Richie said state and local party officials are trying to build on the huge primary and caucus turnout to help Democrats in the fall general election and in 2010 .
" We are proud of both our presidential candidates who helped create that turnout .
We ask now that the campaigns work with us rather than become an impediment to this extraordinary opportunity to build our party , " Richie said .
Texas Democrats are trying to regain power after losing all statewide offices to Republicans in 1998 and complete control of the Legislature in 2002 .
Caucus attendance represented a tenfold increase over the previous high attendance mark for the party , Richie said .
" As expected in any record turnout involving hundreds of thousands of people , there were reports of problems caused by long lines and crowded facilities .
These problems are not unique to Texas .
Similar problems , in proportionately similar numbers , occurred in pure caucus states like Iowa and Nevada , " Richie said .
He said most of the problems do n't affect the legitimacy of delegate allocation .
Caucus delegates are awarded as a result of three stages : the precinct conventions , or caucuses , held election night ; county and senate district conventions planned for March 29 ; and the state Democratic convention on June 6 - 7 .
The candidate with the most supporters showing up at each convention level will benefit in the awarding of delegates .
State party spokesman Hector Nieto said Monday party officials are continuing to meet with the Clinton and Obama campaigns about the March 29 conventions .
There is no plan at this time for the party to provide a statewide count of those regional convention results , he said .

Splitting Apart the Split Screen The Journey to Find , Analyze , and Fix Pac Man ’s Split Screen
By Don Hodges
Started 10/28/2007
Posted : 12/8/2007
Last Update : 2/19/2017 4/21/2008 :
This article is featured on Kotaku 's home page http://kotaku.com/

In the previous article on Donkey Kong , we saw that the game designers built in a mechanism to prevent the player from ever passing level 99 .
After level 99 is reached , it repeats forever , never advancing to 100 .
However , this is not widely known because a timer bug prevents anyone from ever passing level 22 .
If only the designers of Pac - Man had done something similar .
But they did n’t , and Pac - Man suffers from the well known split screen when level 256 is reached .
We will examine how and why this occurs , and create a patch to fix the program ’s bug .
The Problem
The first step is to search the Internet to see if this answer has already been found .
We find a lot of good work has been done at Mark Longridge 's web site [ http://cubeman.org/arcade-source/pacman.asm ] where Pac Man ’s code is disassembled and some comments are added .
There is also a more complete disassembly of Ms. Pac Man at Scott Lawrence ’s web site http://umlautllama.com/projects/pacdocs/mspac/mspac.asm.
Ms. Pac Man shares a great deal of code with the original Pac Man , so some of these comments are useful as well .
Now we need to understand the nature of the split screen bug .
It occurs on board 256 , presumably because the game is trying to draw 256 fruits .
Immediately we see from the source code on Mark Longridge 's site a comment which mentions drawing the fruit .
2C03 CD8F2B CALL # 2B8 F ; Draw fruit
Using this we discover the subroutine which draws the fruit .
It follows here with my comments .
You will probably need some knowledge of assembly language to follow this .

If the level is 7 or less , set the pointer to the starting fruit to the cherry
If the level is 8 or more , set the fruit pointer to the starting fruit for the current level .
If the level is 19 or above , set the fruit pointer to the 1st key .
Set up two counters .
One is for drawing fruit , the other is for possibly drawing blank spaces in cases where there are less than 7 fruit to draw .
Draw the fruit , color the fruit .
Increase the pointers to the next fruit in the table and the next location on screen .
Loop back up to 7 times to draw the rest of the fruit .
Check to see if any blank spaces are needed .
If so , then draw the proper number of blank spaces and color them all black .
Return to the program .
We need to know that levels on Pac Man are stored with a starting value of zero .
In other words , the first level that we play ( cherry ) is treated as level zero by the game .
The second level ( strawberry ) is counted as level 1 by the game , and so on .
The programmers know this and so when the subroutine is called to draw the fruit , it loads the level counter and then increases it by one .
Then it figures out how many and which fruit to draw .
When level 256 is reached , it is counted by the game as level 255 ( this number is # FF in hexadecimal ) .
The subroutine is called to draw the fruit and the value for the level wraps around to zero when it is incremented .
No check is done to see if the Carry flag is set , which would have been one way for the programmers to realize the game has reached this point .
So with the counter at zero , this causes the subroutine which draws fruit to think that it is a level less than 7 with only 1 to 7 fruit to draw , in addition to some possible blank spaces .
The program starts drawing fruit with the counter in register B set to zero , instead of the expected number from 1 to 7 .
At the end of the loop , B is decreased by one and checked for zero .
If it is not zero then the loop runs again , if it is zero then the subroutine ends .
On level 256 , B is zero to begin with .
It is decremented at the end of the loop , which makes it roll back down to 255 , causing the loop to run a total of 256 times , which is why the split screen gets drawn on this level .
The result is that memory locations which are up to 512 bytes past the start of the fruit table , which are used for some other totally different part of the program , are drawn on the screen at increasing locations in video memory .
The subroutine which draws the fruit is expecting only eight distinct values for the various fruit , and is expecting only seven memory locations where the fruit are drawn at the bottom of the screen .
The memories which end up getting fed into this subroutine have different values than the ones the subroutine is expecting .
There are two main parts to drawing a fruit .
The first part draws the fruit , and the second part draws the color .
It turns out that each fruit is actually made up of four separate pieces of graphics , all painted with a single color code .
Let ’s examine the subroutines which draw the fruit and the colors .
The following subroutine draws the four parts of a fruit onscreen .
It requires that A is loaded with the code for the first part of the fruit and HL is loaded with the memory address of the first position on screen where it is to be drawn .
2B8F E5 PUSH HL ; Save HL 2B90 D5 PUSH DE ; Save DE 2B91 111F00 LD DE , #001F ; this offset is added later for third part of fruit 2B94 77 LD ( HL ) , A ; Draw first part of fruit code into screen memory 2B95 3C INC A ; Point to second part of fruit 2B96 23 INC HL ; Increment screen memory for second part of fruit 2B97 77 LD ( HL ) , A ; Draw second part of fruit code into screen memory 2B98 3C INC A ; Point to third part of fruit 2B99 19 ADD HL , DE ; Add offset for third part of fruit 2B9A 77 LD ( HL ) , A ; Draw third part of fruit code into screen memory 2B9B 3C INC A ; Point to fourth part of fruit 2B9C 23 INC HL ; Increment screen memory for fourth part of fruit 2B9D 77 LD ( HL ) , A ; Draw fourth part of fruit code into screen memory 2B9E D1 POP DE ; Restore DE 2B9F E1 POP HL ; Restore HL 2BA0 C9 RET ; Return
The following subroutine draws colors onscreen for a 2x2 grid .
It requires that A is loaded with the code for the color and HL is loaded with the memory address of the position on screen where the first color is to be drawn .
If a clear value is to be drawn , the first address is called ( # 2B7E ) .
If A is preloaded with a color , then the second address is called ( # 2B80 ) .

The next part of understanding the split screen is to examine the memory locations of the screen elements .
Luckily this has already been done by Bart Grantham .
http://www.bartgrantham.com/projects/mspacman/sprite-RAM.html
The memory grid has been overlayed with the screen to show this :
The color memory map is the same except all address are # 0400 higher .
The extreme four corners exist in memory but are not visible on the screen .
This is important because some of the fruits end up getting drawn into these invisible memories .
The screen memory starts in the lower right corner , and goes right - to - left for the bottom two rows .
After the bottom two rows , the screen memory continues near the upper right corner in location # 4040 and then goes top - to - bottom down each strip of the playing field , after each strip the next one starts one column to the left of the previous .
After the last position on the playing field , near the bottom left corner , the memories then jump to the top right corner and two rows run across the top , right - to - left , much like the bottom two rows .
Using the cherry as an example , observe how the fruit drawing program works .
The subroutine draws the first part of the fruit , then increments both pointers which indicate which graphic to draw and where to draw it .
The graphic pointer is incremented but in order to draw the third part of the fruit , the location pointer needs to go down one row and then back one , which is accomplished in the subroutine by adding # 1 F hexadecimal .
Then the third part of the fruit is drawn .
The fourth part of the fruit is drawn after incrementing both pointers by one .
Examine for the example of drawing a cherry :
Location 4004 .
Code drawn is # 90 = top right of cherry
Location 4004+1 = 4005 .
Code drawn is # 91 = top left of cherry
Location 4004+1+1E = 4024 .
Code drawn is # 92 = bottom right of cherry
Location 4004+1+1E+1 = 4025 .
Code drawn is # 93 = bottom left of cherry
After the cherry is drawn , the program calls the subroutine which draws in the color , which is basically the same except it writes to the color memory instead of character memory , and it writes the same color to all four positions instead of increasing the value each time .
That ’s it .
Now the process is repeated as necessary , and depending on the level , up to seven fruit are drawn at the bottom of the screen .
The Bug in Action
On level 256 , due to the bug in the algorithm , the program attempts to draw 256 fruit instead of a regular amount .
The routine continues on and starts grabbing data that is past the fruit table in memory and starts drawing the characters in those memories as if they were fruit , into increasing locations in memory with starting values incremented by two each time .
The routine keeps incrementing the location to draw by two .
The first thirteen fruit are drawn along the bottom .
The thirteenth fruit , ( the first key ) is the last drawn on the screen without any corruption .
The fourteenth fruit , ( the 2nd key ) , is drawn into the very bottom - left corner of video memory which is not visible on the screen ( starting with address # 401E ) .
Then the next fruit drawn , ( the third key ) , starts at address # 4020 which is the bottom right corner , not visible on screen .
But the fruit - drawing routine draws four locations : # 4020 , # 4021 , # 4040 and # 4041 .
So , the top half of this fruit is not seen onscreen .
The bottom half is drawn into the top - right location of the playing field , going top - to - bottom instead of going right - to - left .
The next fruit that is drawn , ( the fourth key ) , is visible onscreen , split between the bottom right corner for its top half , and the top right side of the playing field for the bottom half .
This is repeated for the entire bottom row , including into the very bottom left corner where the top half memories are not visible onscreen ( #403E and # 403 F ) , but the bottom half is drawn to the bottom two places in the first column of the playfield ( #405E and # 045 F ) .
Also during this bottom row , after the 8th key is drawn , ( the 5th visible being split at the bottom ) , the fruit table ends and the program starts drawing fruit using values from the memories that come after the fruit table .
These values cause the subroutine to draw seemingly random fruit and colors .
For example , the values of the two memory locations which follow final key in the fruit table are # 73 and # 20 .
So the program tries to draw fruit # 73 with color # 20 into the next memory locations .
The subroutine draws character values # 73-#77 , which are not visible characters , so it just draws blanks on the screen .
The next two values in memory are #00 and # 0C .
The subroutine draws a “ fruit ” with these values by drawing the numbers 0 , 1 , 2 , and 3 into these memories onscreen .
However , the color subroutine draws color # 0C which is black , so these values are erased from view almost instantly after they are drawn .
Looking at the last fruit to be split between the bottom of the screen and the right side , we observe the behavior of the 9th fruit after the end of the fruit table .
The first value that is drawn is # 06 which draws the number 6 , 7 , 8 , and 9 into memory , as seen .
Then the color subroutine blanks them all out with a black color .
Looking at the next fruit , we see it is split between invisible memories in the bottom left of the screen and the right side .
The memory contains # 04 which makes the subroutine draws the number 4 , 5 , 6 , and 7 into memory , as seen .
After they are drawn , the color subroutine blanks them all out with a black color .
After the end of the bottom row , the starting addresses of the fruit shift from # 403E , to # 4040 which is the top right corner of the playfield .
The 11th location after the fruit table is drawn into the top right corner of the playfield , and we can see that since the memories here are arranged differently than at the bottom , the fruits are drawn going down 2 columns instead of across 2 rows .
Then the program draws the corrupted fruit values down each column of memory , overwriting the values that it had written on the previous pass for the bottom half of the fruit , with new values for the top half of each fruit as well as its own bottom half in the next column over .
These bottom half values keep getting replaced by the next column of fruits , except in the final column when the subroutine ends .
It turns out that some of the memories contain codes that will draw dots onto the screen that Pac Man can eat .
If the memory location has a value of # 0 F or # 10 , an edible dot will be drawn to the screen .
There are several locations in this range that meet this condition , and so several of the characters that are drawn in the split screen are edible dots .
If # 13 or # 14 had existed in any of these memories , an energizer would have been drawn , but these values do not appear in this memory range .
The last memory location drawn is at location # 4202 , which is # 200 more than the location of the first cherry ( #4002 ) .
It is # 200 because the program loops # 100 ( 256 decimal ) times , incremented by two each time .
In addition , after the all of these corrupted fruit values are drawn , the program thinks that it has drawn no fruit and proceeds to draw seven blank spaces .
This is because the counter that starts at seven and is counted down each time a fruit is drawn , wraps around itself and returns to seven after the 256th fruit is drawn .
So after the last fruit , the program draws seven blank spaces and colors them black .
This occurs for memory locations # 4204 through # 4210 , the last of which clear off the left side of the center portion of the ghost ’s home box .
We can see more clearly the data written to the screen by taking a screen shot of the level being cleared by the rack skip dip switch setting .
This un-hides most of the data written to the screen that might otherwise be hidden by being colored black .
Finally the subroutine ends and the program continues “ normally ” .
The game then draws the player ’s remaining Pac Men in the lower left of the screen .
This process overwrites the top half of the bells , galaxians , and one of the limes that were drawn in those locations , as well as any graphics that were drawn into their bottom halves .
Then the game returns , and Pac Man is doomed because this level is un-finishable .
There are not enough dots on the screen to eat to finish the level , even though the game re-draws the split screen each time the player dies , which means the dots in the right hand side reappear and can be eaten again .
If the memories contained enough values of # 0 F or # 10 , which draw dots to the screen , it is conceivable that this level could have been passable .
THE FIX
The next step is to fix the code so that this behavior does not occur on level 256 .
A close look at the disassembly of Ms. Pac Man at Scott Lawrence ’s web site ( http://umlautllama.com/projects/pacdocs/mspac/mspac.asm ) shows a “ fix ” that has been written by Mark Spaeth : HACK8 : Mark Spaeth 's " 20 byte " level 255 Pac - Man rom fix ; level 255 pac fix ; HACK8 ;0A90 C3800F JP # 0F88 ;0A93 00 NOP … ; 0F88 3A134E LD A , ( # 4E13 ) ; board number ;0F8B 3C INC A ;0F8C FEFF CP #FF ;0F8E 2803 JR Z, #0F93 ; do n't store level if == 255 ;0F90 32134E LD ( # 4E13 ) , A ; store new board number ; 0F93 C3940A JP # 0A94 ; jump back
What does this fix do ?
It overwrites the program that increases the game ’s level with a jump command ( called a ‘ hook ’ ) that takes it out to a new subroutine that has been written and placed in some unused memory .
This subroutine really has nothing directly to do with the fruit drawing .
It checks the value of the level right after it has been increased after a level is completed .
If an overflow occurs , the result is not written back to memory .
Then it jumps back to the original program .
The result is the game stays forever on game level # FE ( the 255th screen ) and never goes any higher .
Another hack which bypasses the self - test must also be employed with this one , or else the checksum routines that are run when the game powers on will detect a problem and refuse to run the game .
Not being satisfied with Mark Spaeth ’s “ fix ” , we devise one that actually corrects the flawed logic in the fruit drawing subroutine .
To be elegant , we will fix the code within the confines of the original code space .
Here is the fix .
There may also be other ways to implement this .
Here are the first few lines of the original fruit drawing subroutine 2BF0 3A134E LD A , ( # 4E13 ) ; Load A with level number 2BF3 3C INC A ; Increase by one 2BF4 FE08 CP # 08 ; Is this level < 8 ?
2BF6 D22E2C JP NC , #2C2E ; No , jump to compute different start for fruit table Part of the fix will change the code to read this way : 2BF0 3A134E LD A , ( # 4E13 ) ; Load A with level number 2BF3 FE07 CP # 07 ;
Is this level < 7 ?
2BF5 D22E2C JP NC , #2C2E ; No , jump to compute different start for fruit table 2BF8 3C INC A ; Increase by one So instead of increasing the value by 1 and then checking against 8 , we check against 7 and increase only if the original value is less than 7 .
Now we have to modify the code that starts at # 2C2E if the level is greater than 7 .
The original code reads 2C2E FE13 CP # 13 ; Is the level > # 13 ( 19 decimal , 7th key ) ?
2C30 3802 JR C , #2C34 ; No , skip next step 2C32 3E13 LD A , # 13 ; Yes , load A with # 13 2C34 D607 SUB # 07 ; Subtract 7 to point to first value to be drawn
We modify this to read : 2C2E FE12 CP # 12 ;
Is the level > # 12 ( 18 decimal , 7th key ) ?
2C30 3802 JR C , #2C34 ; No , skip next step 2C32 3E12 LD A , # 12 ; Yes , load A with # 12 2C34 D606 SUB # 06 ; Subtract 6 to point to first value to be drawn
We arrive at this location with A being one less than the program was expecting , because we did not increment it before coming here .
So we check against # 12 instead of # 13 , force to # 12 instead of # 13 , and subtract 6 instead of 7 to make up for it .
Everything else can remain the same and the bug is fixed .
The last thing that needs to be done is to fix the power - on checksum routine so that this change can be made without causing a memory error .
Instead of creating or using another hack to bypass the self - tests , we will add offsets to the end of this memory bank to make the checksums add up properly .
The checksum routines in this game first add up all the even bytes in a memory bank and check against # 00 , and then repeat this for the odd numbered bytes in the memory bank .
We do some quick math and discover that the new program ’s even bytes add up to # 18B less checksum bytes than the program it replaces , and the new program ’s odd bytes add up to # 187 more checksum bytes than the program it replaces .
To fool the program ’s checksum we therefore add # 8B to an unused even memory location and # 79 to an unused odd memory location .
Before : 2FFC : 00 2FFD : 00 After : 2FFC : 8B 2FFD : 79
The total patch is made by changing just nine bytes of the original code , plus two bytes for the checksum fix .
This patch can be written into Puckman romset file named [ namcopac.6h ] into three areas .
For continuity , this is padded with four bytes of the original code , making it 15 bytes instead of the expected 11 bytes .
0BF3 : FE 07 D2 2E 2C 3C 0C2F : 12 38 02 3E 12 D6 06 0FFC : 8B 79 MAME will complain that the ROM set is bad , because it uses more complicated hashing algorithms to detect errors , but it will still work .
Alternately we can use a MAME cheat code and run it when needed : : puckman: 20700001:2BF3:FE07D22E:FFFFFFFF: No Split Screen : puckman:20510001:2BF7:00002C3C:0000 FFFF : No Split Screen ( 2/5 ) : puckman:20010001:2C2F:00000012:000000 FF: No Split Screen ( 3/5 ) : puckman:20610001:2C33:0012D606:00 FFFFFF: No Split Screen ( 4/5 ) : puckman:20510001:2FFC:00008B79:0000 FFFF : No Split Screen ( 5/5 ) Learn more about cheat codes in MAME at http://cheat.retrogames.com
This cheat will also work for all of the Pac Man ROM sets in MAME , as they all suffer from the split - screen bug .
The exception is the bootleg that runs on Galaxian hardware ( pacmanbl ) which does not suffer from this bug to begin with .
After being patched , the game no longer tries to draw 256 fruit when reaching level 256 .
It draws seven keys and the level can be finished , at which point the game wraps around back to level 0 ( cherry ) , and will show its intermissions again at the same places .
However , the game does not become easy again but stays on the same difficulty level where the energizers have no effect .
The player may continue to use the previous 9th key patterns for the rest of the game .
Thoughts & Comments
It is probably a good thing that Pac Man has this bug in its program .
If it did n’t , expert players could conceivably be able to play the game indefinitely , because whenever they get tired they can just park Pac Man in the hiding places and leave the game to go eat , sleep , or whatever , and then return to the game and continue playing .
The only limiting factor would have been the length of time that the game could run without a power outage or suffering from some other hardware failure .
Experts would have been able to play the game for weeks , months , even years , or more .
Welcome to the story about Tollund Man
On May 8 , 1950 the police in Silkeborg received an alarming message .
During a peat digging 2 days earlier a body had been discovered in a bog close to Bjældskovdal , an area located approximately 10 kilometers west of Silkeborg .
The finders believed they had found a murder victim and consequently notified the police .
Once the police learned that the body had been discovered 2 1/2 meters into the peat and that there were no signs of recent digging they were almost certain that it was more a case for the people at Museum Silkeborg than the police .
In this part of Museum Silkeborg ’s website you can read more about Tollund Man , how he was discovered , how he died and why he is so well preserved .
He was found in the Bjældskovdal bog in 1950 , and has been at Silkeborg Manor since 1952 where thousands of people from around the world flock to see him .
A meeting with Tollund Man is a meeting with the past – face to face .
Like many of his other views and policies , Sen .
John McCain 's approach to science , technology and environmental issues does n't always fall within party lines .
But critics say they are n't always consistent , either .
Science - policy wonks have generally regarded the Arizona senator as the best option among the Republican presidential candidates .
But as McCain fights to solidify his status as a front - runner in the Republican race , at least one environmental group accuses McCain of changing positions to appease the GOP base – the very charge McCain 's been trying to pin on rival Mitt Romney .
" It appears that he 's made a significant change in his position , which we find quite troubling , " says Tony Massaro , political director with the League of Conservation Voters .
Massaro points to a bill McCain co-sponsored with Sen. Joe Lieberman ( D - Connecticut ) , which they 've been trying to enact for several years .
The Climate Stewardship and Innovation Act of 2007 would reduce the emission of greenhouse gases 65 percent by 2050 .
The targets are mandatory , achieved through a market - based cap - and - trade system , wherein polluters buy and sell a limited number of emissions permits .
When Lieberman reintroduced the bill last year , McCain reiterated his support , arguing for " rational , mandatory emission - reduction targets and timetables . "
He lauded a similar measure under consideration in California .
But when MSNBC anchor Tim Russert asked McCain last week whether he favors " mandatory caps , " he denied it .
" No. I 'm in favor of cap - and - trade . "
" He 's been by far the best Republican on this issue until he made that statement last week , " Massaro says .
In other technology - related legislative efforts , McCain – like colleagues in both parties – has also sponsored feel - good online child - safety legislation of questionable effectiveness .
On McCain 's campaign website , he touts his sponsorship of legislation that would require the establishment of a national online registry of sex offenders convicted of crimes against children .
The legislation would require those sex offenders to register all their e-mail addresses , instant - messenger screen names and other online identities with the authorities .
Failure to do so would land them back in prison for 10 years .
Groups such as the Center for Democracy and Technology have said the legislation is harmless , but useless .
" Like a lot of these other proposals to protect kids on Capitol Hill , this e-mail registration proposal is something that superficially sounds like a good idea , and a politician can claim to have sponsored legislation to protect kids , " says John Morris , senior counsel at the Center for Democracy and Technology .
" In fact , it almost does nothing to protect them . "
A more sensible bill in the House , Morris says , jettisons the online identifier concept , and instead requires convicted sex offenders on probation or parole to install filtering software on their computers that would block access to sites where children congregate .
The offender 's computer use and the settings on that software would be monitored by his probation or parole officer .
" Although they started off in the same place , Congressman Pomeroy ( the sponsor of the House bill ) shifted gears , and they now have a bill that actually targets the sex offenders who are problems instead of this general blunderbuss approach which will not be effective and is in fact window dressing , " Morris says .
McCain scores higher points with business technologists .
Michael Arrington , the editor of the influential blog TechCruch , recently endorsed McCain for supporting H1 - B temporary work visas for programmers , among other pro-business moves .
( Arrington endorses Democratic Sen. Barack Obama as well ) .
And Gigi Sohn , co-founder of the public interest lobbying group Public Knowledge , says McCain has proven willing to take stances against the well - funded incumbent telecommunications companies in legislative battles .
Sohn also gives McCain points for joining with Public Knowledge to kill a section of the 2005 Family Home Movie
Act that could have made it illegal for consumers to fast forward through commercials while watching their DVRs .
" He likes being considered a friend of the consumer , " Sohn says .
" If you 're a pro-balanced copyright person , you 're for the ability to make personal uses of the works that you buy . "
Since early 2007 , when food prices began marching noticeably upward , there have been violent riots in more than a dozen countries , growing malaise in developed areas , including the United States , and a fluid debate about the origins of the spike .
On the last point , a consensus has emerged .
A slew of factors — record fuel prices , ethanol production , unprecedented demand , the effects of climate change — have been blamed , creating a sort of perfect storm for the world 's food supply .
Although each merits attention , another culprit must now be added : the human reaction to the crisis .
Since the first of the year , additional jumps in food prices have bred not only uneasiness and widespread fear but also , in recent weeks , extreme responses .
Countries in Asia and South America are clamping down on exports or banning them , often at the behest of panic - stricken leaders worried about inflation .
Further down the supply chain , savvy farmers and producers are hoarding food to delay its sale .
In a sense , the unfolding scene is a sort of " prisoner 's dilemma " known in game theory : Individuals ( and individual countries ) are moving to protect their own interests — " defecting " rather than cooperating — as supplies become more precious .
The effect , some analysts say , has been to drive the market cost of food — rice and wheat , in particular — even higher and to further destabilize countries at risk of violence and hunger .
" A lot of these countries [ with bans ] have poor populations , and they 're worried about inflation , and they know that if they keep supplies high , they can lower costs , " said U.S. Department of Agriculture economist Andy Aaronson .
" That 's just supply - and - demand economics , but it 's a psychology that 's going to have to break . "
Restricting trade is an old and powerful tactic , and countries use it liberally , to protect farmers and consumers , to keep unwanted products out , or to keep internal stockpiles up .
In fact , even before the current food crisis became apparent , many countries had begun blocking exports of products that have become expensive or scarce only recently ; Argentina , in 2006 , banned certain cuts of meat and later extended the ban to wheat .
But since the first of the year , a critical mass has taken hold .
Rice , which is the staple food for roughly half of the world 's population , or more than 3 billion people , has been particularly affected .
China , Vietnam , and Egypt have imposed limits on the amount of rice they will export .
India , at the end of March , banned " non-basmati " rice shipments outright and has continued to ratchet up the minimum price of basmati exports , which are known for their higher quality .
Thailand , the world 's largest rice exporter , is reportedly flirting with the idea of doing the same , even as its farmers toil to plant a third crop of rice this year , one more than usual .
Wheat , too , has seen the scythe of political maneuvering : Last week , Russia extended for 60 days a ban on wheat exports .
China and Argentina have adopted restrictions ; in Pakistan , where farmers have just begun to harvest the annual wheat crop , officials yesterday said the country most likely will fall millions of acres below the expected goal , prompting the government to dispatch soldiers to guard grain elevators .
" Now that the market is so nervous , governments get more nervous , " said Joachim von Braun , director general at the International Food Policy Research Institute .
" In addition to export bans , they try to build up storage to be on the safe side , and governments become part of the speculators . "
The motivation for such bold measures is not hard to discern .
Since the first of the year , rice prices in some areas have doubled ; wheat , on average , is up 115 percent in a year .
( In 2008 , rice prices could jump another 50 percent , according to estimates . )
Because the forces that kindled the rise in prices in the first place , such as increased consumption internationally and competition with biofuel production , are unlikely to subside anytime soon , countries rightfully see high prices as a pervasive threat .
Unrest could mount ; governments could fall .
Egypt , with an increasingly politically restive population , represents a case in point .
In recent weeks , clashes in bread lines have reportedly become routine and sometimes violent .
The state - owned daily newspaper reports that 12,000 people have been arrested for selling flour on the black market .
Rice prices , meanwhile , rocketed from just over $ 200 per ton last October to $ 430 per ton at the end of March .
The government responded on April 1 by suspending rice exports for six months .
The response had an immediate pull :
This week , prices have fallen by more than $ 100 — still high but nonetheless an improvement .
At the same time , individuals further down the totem pole are implementing their own safeguards .
From Egypt to India , reports of hoarding and speculation have become commonplace .
Farmers , expecting higher prices in the near future , are keeping their crops under lock and taking them out of the supply chain .
Distributors are doing the same , hoping to benefit from inflated retail prices .
In the Philippines , which imports much of its rice , the country 's president , Gloria Arroyo , has dispatched an Anti Rice Hoarding Task Force to arrest suspected hoarders .
( Fast - food restaurants there , including McDonald 's and KFC , have been asked to halve the amount of rice they serve with a usual meal . )
Fear of shortages has even found its way to Hong Kong :
In recent weeks , the price of rice in most supermarkets has climbed 30 percent , prompting a spree of panic - buying before Hong Kong officials on Monday were able to guarantee supplies from Thailand , which already provides 90 percent of its rice .
The panics in Hong Kong and the Philippines illustrate an important point :
As exporting countries stop exporting and shore up supplies internally , countries that rely on imports are increasingly vulnerable .
One result , apart from alarm , is that an international game of hot potato has ensued , shifting the squeeze to other countries .
In the case of rice , the demand has been shifted to the United States , among others .
" We 're seeing a lot of nontraditional markets coming to us , " said Thomas Wynn , director of market development for the U.S. Rice Producers Association , noting that the United States is now shipping rice to Cuba , Africa , and the European Union .
The United States should meet the demand , Wynn said , but the extra trade will bring side effects : stockpiles going down , prices , once again , going up .
Meanwhile , humanitarian agencies , which provide much - needed food to volatile countries like Iraq and Afghanistan , are getting lashed from all sides : higher prices , locked supplies , millions of people newly priced out of the market .
To a certain extent , analysts say , these protective measures can't be avoided .
" If you asked every ambassador in the world to come to a meeting , " said Bobby Coats , a professor at the University of Arkansas Cooperative Extension Service , " and everyone showed up and you asked the question , ' Does your country have a policy of protecting your agricultural sector ? ' everyone is going to raise their hands .
Nothing will breed chaos faster than the nonavailability of food to people who are used to having it . "
The flip side , it seems , is that a bunch of protective measures , taken together , can breed chaos for everyone else .
" It 's understandable that leaders will take refuge in export bans when they see no other options , " von Braun said .
" But this policy collectively is a massive policy failure .
At a time of scarcity , when more trade is needed , less is permitted . "
With two polls showing Hillary Rodham Clinton ’s lead shrinking in the critical Ohio primary , her campaign escalated attacks on her opponent , Barack Obama , on Monday , accusing him of distorting his record -- and hers -- on the regionally important issue of trade .
Clinton communications director Howard Wolfson accused Obama of presenting himself as an opponent of the North American Free Trade Agreement , though he had made positive remarks about the treaty when running for the Senate in 2004 .
“ Once again , he is saying one thing in one state and saying something else in another state , ” Wolfson said in a conference call with reporters .
And the two campaigns also traded barbs over a photo of Obama in tribal dress during a visit to Africa two years ago , with his campaign accusing Clinton supporters of circulating the picture in e-mails .

“ Her campaign has engaged in the most shameful , offensive fear - mongering we ’ve seen from either party in this election , ” complained Obama spokesman David Plouffe .
Ohio and Texas hold primaries on March 4 , along with Rhode Island and Vermont .
Clinton and her advisors have acknowledged that she must win Ohio or Texas , if not both , if her bid for the Democratic presidential nomination is to remain viable .
She and Obama debate tonight in Ohio at Cleveland State University .
In Texas , polls suggest that the two are in a dead heat .
In Ohio , Clinton continues to lead Obama , but her margin has narrowed , according to a poll released Monday by Quinnipiac University .
Although Clinton was ahead 55 % to 34 % on Feb. 14 , she now leads 51 % to 40 % .
The biggest shift came from college - educated voters , who supported Clinton 46 % to 41 % on Feb. 14 but now prefer Obama , 58 % to 33 % .
A second poll , the Ohio Poll , sponsored by the University of Cincinnati , showed Clinton with an even narrower lead of 8 points -- 47 % to 39 % -- among likely Democratic voters .

“ Sen . Clinton ’s lead remains substantial , but the trend line should be worrisome for her in a state that even her husband , former President Bill Clinton , has said she must win , ” said Peter A. Brown , assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute .
In a written statement , he said that Obama ’s national momentum -- he has won the last 11 nominating contests -- appeared to be eroding Clinton ’s support among her core constituency : “ women , older voters and those lower on the social - economic and education scale . ”
The two candidates ’ positions on free - trade agreements in general , and NAFTA in particular , have become a key point of contention in Ohio , a state where many blame globalization for its heavy loss of manufacturing jobs .
Both have supported trade agreements in the past but are now emphasizing their criticism of NAFTA .
“ Certainly in certain parts of the country , our trade agreements have cost jobs and have resulted in dislocation , ” said Clinton spokesman Wolfson .
“ This is obviously not true in other parts of the country .
I think people in Texas . . . would have a different view of NAFTA than folks in Ohio would . ”

At a debate last week in Austin , Texas , the two candidates were largely cordial to each other .
But Clinton ’s attacks on the Illinois senator have intensified in recent days as her position in the polls has appeared to be slipping .
Over the weekend , she accused Obama of misrepresenting her positions on trade and healthcare in fliers mailed to voters .
“ Shame on you , Barack Obama , ” she said .
“ It is time you ran a campaign consistent with your messages in public .
That ’s what I expect from you .
Meet me in Ohio .
Let ’s have a debate about your tactics . ”
For its part , the Obama campaign accused the New York senator of dirty tactics on Monday after a photograph of Obama wearing a white turban and a robe was posted on the Drudge Report .
The 2006 photo showed Obama dressed in Somali tribal clothing while visiting the western part of Kenya , his late father ’s native country .
The website said the photograph was “ circulated ” by Clinton campaign staffers .
The original e-mail was not posted .

Obama , a member of a United Church of Christ congregation in Chicago , has repeatedly fended off insinuations that he is Muslim -- rumors apparently promoted by opponents who hope to suggest that a Muslim is not acceptable as a presidential candidate .
The Clinton campaign said it did not authorize distribution of the photo , although campaign officials stopped short of a categorical denial .
“ I just want to make very clear that we were not aware of it , ” Wolfson said in a conference call .
“ The campaign did not sanction it . ”
However , in an unusual statement , Clinton campaign manager Maggie Williams attempted to suggest that the controversy related to race or Obama ’s African heritage , not religion .
“ If Barack Obama ’s campaign wants to suggest that a photo of him wearing traditional Somali clothing is divisive , they should be ashamed , ” Williams said .
“ Hillary Clinton has worn the traditional clothing of countries she has visited and had those photos published widely . ”

Williams did not deny that the photo might have been circulated by campaign workers .
The accusations traded by the campaign staffers overshadowed the candidates ’ own appearances on Monday .
Clinton delivered what aides described as a major foreign - policy speech at George Washington University in Washington before attending an evening fundraiser .
She did not announce any new positions , although she warned pointedly about the dangers of electing a president with limited foreign - policy credentials .
Addressing a packed rally at the University of Cincinnati , Obama avoided all mention of Clinton in his nearly 50 minutes of remarks .
But he did talk about her during an evening rally at Wright State University in Dayton , Ohio , citing her as someone who has criticized his repeated use of the word “ hope ” in his campaign .

Yesterday I was fortunate enough to be posted on reddit ’s front page and consequently had more than 110,000 visitors , which of course gave me a bit of a thrill .
I did n’t get around to replying to a pile of comments , so just wanted to say thanks to everyone who took the time to write .
I really appreciate the positive comments and suggestions , and to those few who left totally bizarre comments , all I can say is just stick with your medication and I ’m sure the voices will stop .
An international team of scientists has presented its list of those regions of the planet most at risk from global warming , which are in danger of " sudden and catastrophic collapse " should they pass " tipping point " thresholds beyond which they will never recover .
The researchers , comprising experts from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany , the University of East Anglia and Oxford University 's Environmental Change Institute , quizzed " 52 environmental experts and combined their responses with discussions among 36 leading climate researchers at a workshop at the British embassy in Berlin " , the Guardian explains .
UN predictions suggest that global temperatures will rise by up to 6.4 °C by the end of the century , with 4 °C being a likely figure .
This represents very bad news indeed for Arctic sea ice and the Greenland ice sheet , which the team identfied as being top of the chop list .
Specifically , if temperatures rise between 0.5 °C to 2 °C " above those at the beginning of the century " , Arctic sea ice will go into " irreversible decline " - a process which may already have begun .
The Greenland ice sheet , meanwhile , is currently threatened by a 50 per cent possibility that it has already begun terminal meltdown .
Although the process could last centuries , the end result would be a seven - metre rise in sea levels globally .
Next up of the environmental apocalypse list is the Amazon rainforest , where " reduced rainfall threatens to claim large areas of trees that will not re-establish themselves " .
A temperature rise of 3 °C to 5 °C might reduce rainfall in the Amazon by 30 per cent , extending the dry season , and provoking a vicious circle of decline .
Other threatened ecosystems include northern Boreal forests , " with large swathes dying off over the next 50 years " , and the western Antarctic ice sheet , where evidence demonstrates " the balance of snowfall and melting has shifted and it is now shrinking " .
A local rise in temperature of over 5 °C could trigger " uncontrollable melting , adding five metres to sea levels within 300 years " .
And just to really cheer us all up , the scientists also predict the collapse of the west African monsoon , increasingly erratic Indian summer monsoons and an intensification of the El Niño climate system which has " a profound impact on weather from Africa to North America " .
In summary , the Guardian notes that the predicted 4 °C rise in temperatures would cause " droughts and floods , as rainfall increases at high latitudes and drops in the tropics " .
Africa would be worst affected by drought , suffering a 15 to 35 per cent drop in harvest yields , compared to a global average fall of ten per cent .
Twenty to 50 per cent of land species would meanwhile be driven to extinction , while humanity tackled an estimated 59 cm rise in sea levels , threatening low - lying coastal cities .
The team 's cheerful findings are published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
Lead author Tim Lenton , an environmental scientist of the University of East Anglia , concluded : " There 's a perception that global warming is something that will happen smoothly into the future , but some of these ecosystems go into an abrupt decline when warming reaches a certain threshold .
" If we know when the different tipping points are , we can use them to inform targets to limit global warming .
It gives us something to aim for . " ®
And the good news ?
Our own team of experts has calculated that a 4 °C rise in temperatures would reduce the need for UK pub patio heaters - deployed in winter to allow nicotine addicts to light up without risking frostbite - by around 46 per cent .
This would result in a 0.0001 per cent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions , and a saving of around 1.4 m tonnes of the paper which would otherwise be required by the EU to draft reports on why patio heaters should be banned .
You see , it 's not all doom and gloom after all ...

Seven years in the credit - counseling business did n't prepare Ann Estes for the alarming trend she began noticing last fall :
As her clients ' mortgage bills became unaffordable , a growing number of them began paying their credit card bills before — and sometimes instead of — their mortgages .
" We 've never seen anything like this , " says Estes , who counsels clients by phone from her office in Richmond , Va .
" Their homes are at risk , and they know it .
But people say , ' I do n't want to let my credit cards go because that 's my cash flow . ' " STORY : Credit cards go after college students CHART : Changes in spending habits Across the nation , credit counselors are reporting the same trend .
Credit bureau analyses of consumer payment data show that financially squeezed borrowers have begun paying their credit card and car bills before their mortgages .
That 's a striking reversal from the norm , one that reflects rising desperation .
It suggests that some people essentially have given up trying to stay current with their mortgages and instead are focused on using credit cards to squeak by .
If the trend persists , many economists say , it could accelerate mortgage losses and further drag down the economy .
Rising living costs , along with cheap and plentiful credit , have led consumers to rely more on plastic to pay for necessities they can't live without — and luxuries they do n't want to do without .
But as the economy weakens , consumers are starting to spend less on discretionary items , such as furniture and electronics , and more on such necessities as groceries and gas , according to government data .
Such items increasingly are showing up on credit card bills .
" Everything 's going up — dairy , gas , home taxes , " says Christie Carlson , 34 , a single mother of five children , ages 5 to 14 , in Tomah , Wis. , who enrolled in a debt - management program after racking up $ 20,000 in card debt .
" I 'm trying to pay more for everything in cash , but it 's just impossible .
It 's not feasible right now to stop spending on the credit card . "
During the past year , credit card debt has ballooned most rapidly in parts of the nation where the economy is particularly weak , including California , Florida , Arizona and Nevada , says Mark Zandi , chief economist for Moody's Economy.com .
" That suggests that people are turning to their cards in times of financial need , " Zandi says .
" They 're losing jobs and overtime hours and other income and trying to supplement their lower incomes with more spending on credit cards . "
Magnifying the problem has been the shrinking availability of a major alternative to credit cards : home equity loans .
As home values have sunk , homeowners have found it tougher to qualify for such loans .
So they 've turned elsewhere , especially to credit cards , to cover daily expenses .
Even as mortgage growth slowed from April 2006 through December 2007 , card debt accelerated , according to an analysis by the Center for American Progress , a liberal think tank in Washington , D.C. " As people get squeezed , they still have the credit demand , " says Christian Weller , a senior fellow at the center .
" For a few years , mortgages and home equity lines replaced credit card debt .
Now , we 're swinging back to the credit cards . "
Like ' broke college students '
Allen Lisowe and his wife , Jennifer , both 33 , say they 're living like " broke college students , " relying on their credit cards to buy the " stuff we need every day , " such as groceries and gas .
The Lisowes , of New Holstein , Wis. , racked up about $ 20,000 in credit card debt in recent years , most of it from daily expenses such as gas and food .
Two years ago , the couple used a home equity loan to pay credit card and auto loan bills .
They say they 'd consider borrowing from their home equity again , but there 's little equity left to tap .
The growing reliance on plastic may explain why revolving debt — most of which is on credit cards — rose at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 7.8 % , to a record $ 943.5 billion , in 2007 compared with a 6.1 % adjusted rate the year before , according to the Federal Reserve .
Eventually , a worsening economy could limit the rise in card debt .
If the current slowdown turns into a full - fledged recession , many analysts say , lenders could clamp down further on credit .
And consumers would cut back so much on discretionary purchases that , despite their increasing use of credit cards for daily necessities , the rise in overall card debt would likely slow .
There 's some sign this may be occurring already :
After two months of rapid increases , the growth of revolving debt slowed in December , preliminary data from the Federal Reserve indicate .
Credit card figures , though , normally are volatile from month to month .
It 'll be three to six months before it 's clear whether consumers are indeed cutting back on plastic .
The danger is that " The economy has relied on the consumer to keep it afloat for the last seven years , and there 's no more gas in the tank of the consumer , " says Howard Dvorkin of Consolidated Credit Counseling Services in Fort Lauderdale .
" They 've got nothing to give . "
James Chessen , chief economist at the American Bankers Association , a trade group , predicts that " credit card debt is going to slow , but not as much " as in previous economic downturns .
During the housing boom , too many people took out mortgages they could n't afford .
Many now owe more on their houses than they 're worth .
Some are defaulting on their mortgages — figuring they 'll lose their homes anyway — even as they keep paying credit card and auto bills , credit counselors say .
" A lot of people are exhibiting a kind of fatalistic behavior to their mortgages , " says Douglas Hammond , outreach programs director at Alliance Credit Counseling .
" They can't make their mortgage payment , so why ( try to ) make it at all ?
' Let 's keep my car , make my payment on my credit card , so I have some way of feeding my family . ' "
When consumers are " pushed to the wall " and forced to choose between paying the mortgage or credit card bill , Chessen says , those who are likely to lose their homes may choose their credit cards , because " They still need to heat their homes , put food on their tables and fill their cars with gas . "
Allowing your house to be foreclosed on is " not a smart strategy , " Hammond says , " because foreclosure does horrible things to your credit score , and you 'll pay high interest rates " on future loans .
Because it takes months to foreclose on a home , some consumers likely are hoping to stave off foreclosure if their finances improve , says Linda Haran , senior director of Experian Decision Analytics .
A study by Experian found that consumers with weak credit scores — but not necessarily those with strong ones — are paying their credit card bills before their mortgage payments .
The study did n't examine car loans .
But an Equifax analysis shows that 38 % of delinquent mortgage borrowers had kept all their credit card bills current , and 62 % had kept all their auto loans current in the two - year period ending in July 2007 .
In the past , most people would pay late on their credit cards and auto loans before doing so on their mortgages .
This reversal in payment priorities helps explain why the rise in credit card and auto loan defaults — which occur when lenders give up trying to recover a debt — has n't matched the pace of mortgage defaults .
Credit card defaults , while rising fast , are still in line with historic averages .
As the economy has worsened , card issuers have become more selective about offering credit to new customers , and in a growing number of cases , are shrinking card holders ' credit limits .
Yet they 're still sending more solicitations to existing credit card customers .
In 2007 , issuers increased their solicitations to existing customers by 15.6 % , advertising rewards and other perks to promote spending , according to Mintel , a firm that tracks such mailings .
Subprime customers — among the most profitable for banks because of the high rates and fees on their cards — saw a 41 % jump in direct - mail credit card offers in the first half of 2007 , the latest period for which figures were available , compared with the same period the year before , Mintel found .
It 's a matter of time , some analysts say , before financially squeezed consumers max out their credit cards and start defaulting in larger numbers .
" My guess is that you 'll see increasing numbers of people walking away from credit card debt the same way that they 're walking away from the mortgages , " says Ken McEldowney , an executive director at Consumer Action , a consumer advocacy group .
When Phyllis Coleman 's mortgage payment jumped 26 % last year , she began withdrawing cash from her credit cards to pay the mortgage .
That worked for a few months , until Coleman , 50 , of Fairfield , Calif. , maxed out on the cards ' credit limit .
She defaulted on her mortgage and now faces foreclosure on her home .
Eventually , she also had to stop paying her credit cards , which she 'd been relying on to cover daily expenses .
" It became too much , " Coleman says , " when gas started going up .
I just got deeper and deeper " in debt .
Using credit cards for gas Consumers with the least financial resources are pressured the most by a deteriorating economy and rising living costs .
For this group , credit cards are simply a way to delay the financial pain .
In recent years , banks have ramped up card rewards , enticing more people to charge their purchases .
As gas costs rise to levels many people can't afford — the national average for regular gas this week was $ 3.16 a gallon , up 32 % from the same time last year — the number of consumers buying gas with credit cards instead of cash is accelerating , says Sonja Hubbard , CEO of E - Z Mart Stores , which has 307 locations in five states .
" People have less cash in their pocket , and if you have a $ 10 bill , that does n't get you a lot of gas anymore , " says Hubbard , who notes that most of her customers now charge gas to credit cards .
The move toward using credit cards for daily needs is occurring among blue - collar and white - collar professionals , credit counselors say .
" I put three doctors on debt - management plans and thought , ' Wow , it 's getting tough , ' " says Anissa Lipscomb , a credit counselor in Gaston , N.C .
The doctors had sought counseling , Lipscomb says , because of surging insurance rates , high credit card debt and patients who had defaulted on medical bills .
For years , rising health care costs have cut into families ' discretionary income .
But if the economy worsens , employers are likely to pass along higher health care costs to workers .
That , in turn , could force more people of all income levels to boost their use of credit cards .
" Your typical American household is very vulnerable , and they 've been vulnerable for a long time , " says Tamara Draut of Demos , a think tank in New York .
" Now that energy costs are going up , health care ( costs ) are going up , people are turning to credit cards . "
Annie Edwards , a credit counselor in Rapid City , S.D. , says a growing number of clients are charging health care expenses .
Financial firms are encouraging them to do so with the rollout of cards and lines of credit designed specifically for health care , she notes .
In October , Republic Bank ( RBCAA ) and Humana ( HUM ) introduced the HumanaAdvance health care credit card , which can be used at hospitals and doctors ' and dentists ' offices .
The card , says Steve Trager , CEO of Republic Bank , assures users that they " will have a means to pay for unexpected health care expenses . "
Citigroup ( C ) , Capital One ( COF ) and General Electric 's ( GE ) CareCredit division also offer loans for medical costs .
Diane Drew , a credit counselor in Menasha , Wis. , says people " want to make sure they can get the health care they need for them and their families , " even if it means going into debt .
Maria Fernandez , a real estate agent in Rodeo , Calif. , says the weak housing market has cut deeply into her commissions and made it harder to pay her own mortgage .
Worse , the payment on her adjustable - rate mortgage jumped 17 % in October .
Fernandez , 40 , asked her lender to modify the loan to reduce her monthly payment .
She was rejected .
So she 's resigned to losing her house in foreclosure this year .
Meanwhile , she says she 's committed to paying her credit card debts — which she 's consolidated with a debt - management agency — while she has the money .
" It 's really stressful .
I can only afford to pay my credit cards . "

Microsoft's Chris Satchell says that mods on a console , such as those for Unreal Tournament 3 on the PlayStation 3 , " could be really dangerous " because " there 's a lot of people out there that just want to prove they can screw things up . "
Satchell , group general manager for Microsoft 's game development tool XNA , says he 's " a little disturbed " by the idea of anyone allowing script mods running on top of native code without the right security measures .
XNA games run in a " sandbox " layer that keeps them separate from the console , so " there are no unintended consequences from running a game , " Satchell told Eurogamer .
He stops just short of specifically calling out Unreal Tournament 3 or the PS3 , instead simply saying that modding is a security threat to any platform because certain people just can't resist the temptation to cause trouble .
" Any platform that lets you do that , and does n't have the right security measures in place – whether it 's Sony , whether it 's Nintendo , whether it 's Apple , whether it 's anyone – you 're inviting trouble , because sooner or later someone will want to prove they can do it , " he said .
While Microsoft 's desire to protect the Xbox 360's integrity is understandable , you have to wonder how it might affect the XNA
Creator 's Club .
If designers feel stifled or restricted by Microsoft 's security measures , it 's possible that the Club will never achieve any kind of significant momentum .

JOHANNESBURG ( Reuters ) - Zimbabwe ’s President Robert Mugabe has admitted to his family and advisers that he has lost the most important election of his 28 - year rule , South African financial daily Business Day reported on Thursday .
Mugabe lost control of parliament for the first time since independence in 1980 and the opposition Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) said he had also been defeated in a presidential election last Saturday and should concede defeat .
Business Day said Mugabe had privately conceded defeat and was deciding if he should contest a run-off vote needed because MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai failed to secure a clear majority .
“ Mugabe has conceded to his closest advisers , the army , police and intelligence chiefs .
He has also told his family and personal advisers that he has lost the election , ” Business Day quoted an unidentified source as saying .
The newspaper said hardliners in Mugabe ’s government wanted him to see the contest through to the bitter end , but that personal advisers and his family want Mugabe to quit .
The ruling ZANU - PF and Mugabe ’s spokesman were not immediately available for comment .
Mugabe , known for his fierce and defiant rhetoric , has not been seen in public since the vote .
In final results of the election for parliament ’s lower house , the Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) won 99 seats , while Mugabe ’s ZANU - PF won 97 seats and a breakaway MDC faction won 10 .
One independent candidate won a seat .
Results for parliament ’s upper house , the senate , will be issued next .

No official results have emerged in the presidential vote .
Widely blamed for economic collapse of his once prosperous nation , Mugabe has faced growing discontent with the world ’s highest inflation rate of more than 100,000 percent , a virtually worthless currency and severe food and fuel shortages .
The opposition and international observers said Mugabe rigged the last presidential election in 2002 .
But some analysts say discontent over daily hardships is too great for him to fix the result this time without risking major unrest .
The mainstream MDC faction said its Tsvangirai had won 50.3 percent of the presidential vote and Mugabe 43.8 percent according to its own tallies .
It seemed like any other job : " Java / J2 EE contractors needed for a one - to - three month contract to maintain proprietary supply - chain management software . "
Sure , James C could have waited around to find something more interesting , but the pay was fantastic and , being such a short term contract , he figured he had little to lose .
That is , until he came face to face with Codethulhu .
It all started back in 2001 , when a fairly - large manufacturing company decided to develop its own supply - chain management system .
Being that they had no in - house development expertise , they sought help from the Great Old Consultants to build their software .
And build it they did .
The Great Old Consultants worked day and night to create the great system that would come to be known as Codethulhu .
They used only the most diabolical of materials : a Dell SatanicEdge sever , J2EE ( Java 2 Evil Edition , not to be confused with Java 2 Enterprise Edition ) , and the souls of a thousand orphans .
Once their work was complete , the Great Old Consultants vanished , never to be seen again .
Tried as they might , the company was unable to summon back the Great Old Consultants .
This was particularly problematic because the Great Old Consultants took with them , the source code .
With no source code available , there was simply no way to fix bugs and make changes to their custom , multi-million dollar software .
That is , until one engineer had an idea : they could decompile the Java bytecode .
Decompiled code is not a very pretty thing .
Many of the " niceties " of Java code -- comments , variable names , differentiation between FOR and WHILE loops -- are simply non-existent .
And when the original code is developed by the Great Old Consultants , it becomes much worse than " not very pretty . "
It becomes pure evil .
The company decided against using source control to store their decompiled code .
Instead , modules were decompiled on a " need - to - alter " basis , and then re-compiled and deployed once the code changes had been made .
Over the years , the " code base " grew in size , in complexity , and in overall evilness .
One contractor , then on the brink of insanity , said that he had decompiled / changed / recompiled the same module seven different times .
No one can be certain exactly when it happened , but at some point during this cycle , Codethulhu was awoken .
For every moment spent working with -- or even thinking about -- Codethulhu , one offers that much of his sanity to it .
Eventually , one 's mind will become permanently intertwined with the very code base of Codethulhu , joining countless others , and will be forever tormented by its endless diabolic cycle of decompilation / recompilation .
Sadly , James is now one with Codethulhu and Codethulhu is one with James .
By the time that James had figured all of this out , it was too late for him .
His last act of sanity was to send in a partially coherent submission that warned everyone else of his fate and to be wary of that J2EE contract that looks " just like any other job . "
And on that note , Happy Holidays and Happy New Year , All !
Today 's article will be the last new one of 2006 ; the next week and a half will be " Best of 2006 . "

Ive just finished Ron Pauls The Revolution : A Manifesto , and am once again floored by Dr. Pauls ability to identify the most important issues facing this country and explain their libertarian solutions in honest , direct language ,  as George Carlin would say .
In seven concise chapters , heavy with notable quotes from the founders , American historical figures , social researchers and Austrian economists , Dr. Paul destroys the myths of governmental benevolence and benefit on nearly every issue of importance for the present and future of this country .
He begins , of course , with foundational explanations of natural rights and the limits placed on the general government by the constitution which allows its existence .
Paul then excoriates the government and explains the solution to its problems of empire , war , terrorism , conscription , violations of the Bill of Rights , spying , torture , the drug wars , health care , the welfare state , regulatory state , managed trade and the destruction of the American economy at the hands of the Federal Reserve system .
He points out that the differences in the positions of the major parties and politicians are nearly meaningless as our country becomes a de facto one - party state under the centrist Democrats and neoconservative - controlled Republicans .
They fight all day about meaningless details while we descend into tyranny .
Dr. Paul , whose steadfast opposition to warfare in the U.S. Congress extends back to his first terms in office in the 1970s , makes his standard case that rather than leading to some abstract national greatness ,  empire , in fact , weakens America .
He says the cost of maintaining our empire is nearly a trillion dollars a year and that we just cant afford it .
Paul maintains that rather than protecting our freedom , war is nearly as destructive to our society as those of the people we wage them against .
War leads to unchecked executive power and the destruction of our most highly valued liberty .
Paul denounces our governments policy of preemptive aggressive war as always morally and consequentially wrong and never justified .
He also explains the anti-imperialist legacy of the Old Right and the antiwar sentiments of the more thoughtful leaders of the middle - to - New Right such as Russell Kirk , Richard Weaver , and Robert Nisbet .
Paul explains that there is nothing conservative about waging war ; it undermines every principle that conservatives claim to cherish ( i.e. , the Constitution , the rule of law , family values , free markets , fiscal restraint . )
Paul thrashes the War Party over the subject of the next aggressive war on the horizon : Iran .
He reminds us that hes been correct for years in saying there was no evidence of a secret nuclear weapons program in Iran as all 16 U.S. intelligence agencies confirmed in their National Intelligence Estimate last fall and shows clearly that to this administration , as with their invasion of Iraq , the agenda is war and any excuse or varied combination of excuses will do .
Terrorism , the current excuse for our world empire , he explains , is not an enemy , but a strategy employed by enemies .
People in occupied countries , Muslim or otherwise , have used this tactic to try to force the democratic societies which occupy them to withdraw their combat forces due to the expense of the predictable overreaction .
He quotes intelligence beat journalist James Bamfords reporting of Ayman al Zawahiris stated goal of trapping us in the Middle East to give us a desert Vietnam  to bleed us dry and force us out as the Reagan administration helped them do to the Russians in the 1980s .
This being the case , Paul concludes further invasions and occupations of their countries is exactly the wrong policy to follow .
It is the founders  foreign policy of peace , commerce and honest friendship which best protects Americans from terrorism .
( In this section , Paul quotes former CIA counter - terrorism agents Michael Scheuer and Philip Giraldi from my interviews of them for Antiwar Radio . )
Paul says we should demand the immediate repeal of the Military Commissions
Act of 2006 and insist on the protection of habeas corpus for all detainees unless the most immediate circumstances on the battlefield prevent it and that no American should ever be held by the military and subjected to torture as was Jos Padilla .
He has introduced legislation in Congress to ensure those very things , among others , in the American Freedom Agenda Act of 2007 .
Paul says that torture is always wrong and should never be tolerated for one second by the proud residents of a free society no matter what excuse those with power can conjure .
Paul also makes an eloquent case against conscription , calling it slavery  and quoting Daniel Webster and Ronald Reagan to make the case that the draft contradicts the very premise of a free society , the constitution forbids it and that it should never be allowed in this country ever again .
He explains in detail how the administration has told lie after lie in order to justify their blatantly unconstitutional , unnecessary and illegal spying on Americans .
Economist Paul also explains his moral and practical opposition to managed trade organizations like NAFTA and the WTO , since they are unconstitutional transfers of Congress  delegated powers and they actually sanction trade wars , require our Congress to raise taxes when they feel like it and otherwise interrupt peaceful trade .
He points out that nothing new needs to be done to have free trade with other countries ; all the government has to do is stop interfering .
Presto , no tariffs , no subsidies .
It should be no surprise that a free market fundamentalist like Paul opposes all foreign aid and restructuring  of other countries  economies though the IMF and the World Bank , whose proclaimed purpose is to help the poor , when all they do is prop up governments that the locals oppose , distort and disrupt local markets and generally impoverish those who are supposedly being helped .
In The Revolution , as on the House floor , Paul takes a heroic stand against the federal governments war on drugs and the entire policy in general .
It is the creation of the black market by the congress and state legislatures which creates the environment in which murder , extortion and gang wars prevail , he explains .
He gives special attention to the long history of frauds perpetrated by government in order to criminalize marijuana possession and sale .
It was simply racist bigotry against Mexicans and a desire to persecute them which motivated the early American drug warriors .
Their legacy is one of lives destroyed not by drugs , but by the state in its post - constitutional , we own you and will decide whats good for you role it now plays in our society .
In the book Paul brings up the issue of race in terms of a limited national government , the unfair prosecution and sentencing of minorities in the drug wars and in terms of the impossibly burdensome regulatory state .
The solution , he maintains , is a belief in individualism and a willingness of people to enforce their rights from the bottom up rather than looking to Washington DC .
He explains how government serves only to divide us more even when attempting to ameliorate the problems of the past .
Paul also explains how government drives up the cost of health care for everyone and how the current welfare state is simply unaffordable and unsustainable by any measure .
He explains how government interventions have led us to our current crisis and how real laissez - faire  not corporatist or socialist  reforms would fix the problems .
Another example of government failure cited is the current state of public education in this country .
While not calling for abolition of all public schools , Paul does demand we get rid of the federal Department of Education and also explains how incredible amounts of resources are wasted into oblivion by the bureaucrats in ways that would never happen at private schools , making a strong case that parents could afford many more choices in education without the oppressive tax burdens they carry and that they would be well served to seek education outside the strictures of the state .
Always tying political questions back to individual liberty , Paul also asks a basic question almost unheard of in polite company : why should anyone be forced to pay for the education of another and particularly when that person disagrees with the slant of the instruction ?
As just one example of the direction DC is leading us , Paul points out a little noticed but obviously dangerous move by the pharmaceutical companies and the national government to give mandatory mental health exams to all school children in order to force many millions more of them to take psychotropic drugs at the threat of removal from their parents .
He rightly complains that even 20 years ago the people of this country would have been absolutely outraged .
Maybe its the Prozac .
Dr. Paul also excoriates the modern regulatory state and explains how it makes us all poorer in order to benefit those who are already rich .
Paul sticks up for the individual and his property rights against all , the rich , the poor or anyone elses attempts to separate him from it with force  personally or through the state .
It is our free economy , not government intervention which has made us so prosperous .
Pauls argument is nowhere close to an apologia for big business .
It is they who have pushed all along for the governmental cartelization and regulation of business .
The state is the mechanism by which those connected to its power can stifle competition and socialize their costs onto the rest of society .
Questions of environmental pollution are one of Pauls favorite examples of the failures of regulation , and for good reason .
Really , no EPA is necessary  to protect the victims of the crime .
Pollution can be handled simply by protecting peoples basic property rights with local courts .
In fact , the purpose of the EPA is to protect the polluters from competition first and the consequences of polluting the environment second by claiming public ownership of the affected area ( the air , bodies of water , etc. ) and then providing immunity to those politically connected corporations who are within the guidelines they set for themselves .
The right of the average guy to seek redress in a local court is then circumvented by the regulation of the executive branch .
The explanation of why this is so , contained in The Revolution , should be enough to educate even the most pointy - headed of your liberal and leftist friends .
Paul , a supposed student , but really an Austrian school economist in his own right , also gives a concise explanation of the criminal Federal Reserve System which robs the poor to benefit the bankers and merchants of death .
Inflation , Paul explains , is a hidden tax , one that hurts the poor , working and retired people most for the benefit of these war - mongering plutocrats .
They try to make the system seem too mysterious for the average guy to understand but its not .
Stealing is stealing .
The central bank causes the booms and busts they claim to smooth out with their process of artificially inflating the supply of money , causing bubbles of malinvestment in the market and setting us up for recessions .
The popular line that we the people ,  through our  Congress , use the states regulation to protect us from the excesses of capitalism must be the greatest line of bull fed to a population since the Aztec Flower Wars .
Again , the light shed by Paul provides clarity to a subject extremely important and yet opaque to the people most affected .
Dr. Paul ends the book with a celebration of the wide and varied millions whove rallied around his campaign and a call for those of us who love liberty to stand up for ourselves and put our out - of - control empire back in its place .
The joy I feel knowing that millions will eventually read this concise libertarian primer just makes me want to celebrate .
The heroic Ron Paul has done it again .

The Best of Scott Horton
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- Bear Stearns CEO
James Cayne fired back Thursday at criticism of his leadership and allegations of inappropriate behavior published in the Wall Street Journal .
The Journal reported that Cayne was playing bridge and golf and was often out of touch from his embattled Wall Street firm this past summer while its hedge funds collapsed and helped to spark a credit crisis in global financial markets .
Cayne said the Journal 's allegations are ' absolutely untrue . '
The Journal said that during what it described as 10 critical days of the crisis in July , Cayne was playing in a bridge tournament in Nashville , Tenn. , without a cell phone or an email device .
Cayne shot back in a memo to Bear Stearns employees that he " stands by " his 14 - year record at the firm and that allegations of " inappropriate conduct " are " absolutely untrue . "
The paper also reported that Cayne has sometimes smoked marijuana after bridge tournaments , citing attendees at the tournaments , although the paper did not say whether he did so in Nashville in July .
Cayne denied one specific alleged incident in 2004 that the paper asked about , but it reported that when it asked more generally whether he smoked pot during bridge tournaments or on other occasions , he said he would respond only " to a specific allegation . "
In addition for much of the summer the paper reports he typically left the office on Thursday afternoon and played golf at his New Jersey club on Friday , once again out of touch for stretches .
The paper cites unnamed associates and golf club records .
Cayne was not using the golf rounds to conduct business , as many executives do , according to what those who played with him told the paper .
" The golf course for him was an escape , " John Angelo , a hedge - fund client and frequent golf partner , told the Journal .
Another playing partner , talk - show host Maury Povich , told the paper : " Believe it or not , many words are not exchanged about business . "
During the Nashville bridge tournament , the paper reports that Cayne spoke with Bear Stearns ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) executives by phone , then played bridge throughout the afternoon .
The paper reports that Cayne 's activities contrasted with intense efforts by other Wall Street CEOs during the credit crisis of the summer , including James Dimon of JP Morgan Chase ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) , Richard Fuld Jr. of Lehman Brothers ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) and Lloyd Blankfein of Goldman Sachs Group ( Charts , Fortune 500 )
Cayne , 73 , would n't comment on his activities away from the office when asked by the paper .
Other executives defended his involvement in the firm to the paper .
" Anyone who thinks that Jimmy Cayne is n't fired up every day and ready to get to work has n't been living in my world , " Bear Stearns President Alan Schwartz told the paper .
Samuel Molinaro Jr. , Bear 's chief operating and financial officer , also told the paper , " I 've never had a problem reaching him . "
But Angelo told the paper that Cayne follows his club 's policy which prohibits carrying a cell phone or email device while golfing .
Filings with the SEC show that in 2006 Cayne received $ 33.9 million , and as of Jan. 31 held 6.4 million shares in the firm , equal to 5.3 percent of shares outstanding .
That gave him more than a $ 1 billion stake in the company at that time , although shares have plunged more than 30 percent since that time .
Bear Stearns shares fell another 4 percent in morning trading Thursday following the Journal report , although a broad sell - off in the market was hitting the shares of other brokerage firms as well .
Warren Spector , who at the time was co-president of Bear Stearns , also was at the Nashville bridge tournament with Cayne in July , the paper reported .
He oversaw Bear Stearns Asset Management , the division that included the two hedge funds that lost billions during the crisis by making bad bets on securities backed by subprime mortgages .
The paper said that after Cayne returned to New York from the tournament , he called Spector on Aug. 1 and said that he had lost confidence in him and that he should resign .
The paper , citing people familiar with his thinking , said that Cayne was annoyed that Spector had been away from the office during the fund crisis .
Spector 's resignation was announced Aug . 5 .
Alon Halevy and Jayant Madhavan have a post on Google 's Webmaster blog disclosing that Google is now harvesting data that is hidden behind HTML forms .
I 'm very satisfied about this , because it 's something that I had a hand in making happen .
I 've known Alon since 1995 , when he was a researcher and I was his summer intern at Bell Labs in New Jersey ( those were the days when Bell Labs was still relevant to Computer Science research ) .
Until that summer , Alon and I had been working independently of each other on the topic of integrating information from across different data sources ( such as websites ) -- Alon at Bell Labs and I at Stanford , for my PhD dissertation .
We put together our ideas and created the Information Manifold , an information integration system that introduced a key idea : you could describe each data source ( declaratively ) by a local data schema ; map that schema to a global schema that unified all the sources ; and process queries across the global schema .
This task is complicated by the fact that each data source exposes different query processing capabilities , by virtue of the different HTML forms it uses .
We came up with some simple solutions to this problem , but several difficulties remained .
In the meantime , Alon and I went our ways with our careers ;
Alon joined the CS faculty the University of Washington , while I started a company , Junglee , that applied information integration ideas to build the first comparison shopping engine and online job bank .
Junglee was acquired by Amazon.com in 1998 ; in 2000 , I started a Venture Capital firm called Cambrian Ventures and in late 2004 a startup , Kosmix .
Alon and I kept in touch through all this , and in 2004 , he and his student Jayant Madhavan had made great progress on " schema matching " , a research area that has application to the HTML forms problem we had first encountered in the Information Manifold .
I was very happy to egg them on to commercialize their breakthrough , and to provide the funding for the resulting company , Transformic , through Cambrian Ventures .
Between 1995 and 2005 , Web search had become the dominant mechanism for finding information .
Search engines , however , had a blind spot : the data behind HTML forms .
Called the Invisible Web , this data is often estimated to be even larger in size and usefulness than the " visible web " that web crawlers usually index .
The key problems in indexing the Invisible Web are :
Determining which web forms are worth penetrating .
If we decide to crawl behind a form , how do we fill in values in the form to get at the data behind it ?
In the case of fields with checkboxes , radiobuttons , and drop - down menus , the solution is fairly straightforward .
In the case of free - text inputs , the problem is quite challenging -- we need to understand the semantics of the input box to guess possible valid inputs .
Transformic 's technology addressed both problems ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) .
It was always clear to us that Google would be a great home for Transformic , and in 2005 Google acquired Transformic -- a nice return for Cambrian , but also a great place for the Transformic team to make a real difference with their ideas .
The Transformic team have been been working hard for the past two years perfecting the technology and integrating it into the Google crawler .
I 'm very happy to have played a small role in their success story .
An aside on the world of academic research .
Alon and I had some difficulty getting our Information Manifold research published : it was rejected the first time we submitted it to a leading academic conference ; we had to address a lot of criticism and skepticism from the establishment , and it was finally published at the VLDB conference in 1996 .
Remarkably , this paper has since become one of the most cited and influential papers in its field ( see this survey , page 52 ) .
In 2006 , the paper received the 10 - year Best Paper Award at VLDB , given retrospectively to the publication from 10 years ago that made the most impact .
The moral of the story is , sometimes it pays to swim against the current in academic research ; what is fashionable today is rarely what will ultimately make the most impact .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Stocks cut losses Monday morning , with the Dow briefly turning higher , as shares of JP Morgan Chase rallied on bets that its bargain basement purchase of Bear Stearns was a good move for the company .
Bond prices surged , lowering corresponding yields , as investors sought the comparative safety of government debt .
The dollar plunged to a 12 - 1 / 2 year low versus the yen and hit another all - time low versus the euro .
The Dow Jones industrial average ( INDU ) was down about 0.2 % 90 minutes into the session .
The broader Standard & Poor 's 500 ( SPX ) index tumbled 0.8 % , and the Nasdaq composite ( COMP ) shed 1.2 % .
Stocks tumbled at the open after the sale of Bear Stearns and emergency moves by the Federal Reserve exacerbated fears about the fallout in financial markets .
But the declines were not as aggressive as analysts had been expecting , and select financial shares managed to bounce back as the morning continued .
Bear Stearns .
Stocks tumbled Friday on news that Bear Stearns needed emergency funding to avoid a collapse , and fears about the financial sector deepened over the weekend .
On Sunday , JP Morgan Chase agreed to buy Bear for just $ 2 a share , or $ 236 million .
That 's less than 4 % of Bear Stearns ' value at the close of trading on Thursday .
On Friday , Bear shares plunged 47 % to close at $ 30 a share .
One year ago , the stock was worth nearly $ 160 .
( Full story ) .
Bear Stearns ( BSC , Fortune 500 ) shares tumbled 84 % to less than $ 5 a share on Monday .
But JPMorgan Chase ( JPM , Fortune 500 ) , a Dow component , rallied 10.2 % .
Federal regulators accelerated the deal - approval process and the Federal Reserve provided $ 30 billion in funding , the latest in the central bank 's series of drastic steps to protect the financial markets amid the housing and credit crises .
Also on Sunday , the Fed cut the discount rate , a short - term bank lending rate , to 3.25 % from 3.5 % , as a means of making more cash available to strapped banks .
The move occurred just two days ahead of the Fed 's regularly scheduled policy meeting .
The central bank could cut the fed funds rate , a consumer lending rate , by as much as a full percentage point at that meeting , traders estimate .
The fed funds rate currently stands at 3 % .
The Fed also announced Sunday it had created another lending facility that allows big Wall Street firms access to short - term funding .
( Full story ) .
A variety of financial stocks initially tumbled as investors wondered which company would be next to face a fate similar to that of Bear Stearns , with current speculation turning to Lehman Brothers .
( Full story ) .
However , by mid-morning , select financials had turned higher , helping the broader market trim losses .
In global trade , Asian markets plunged and European markets fell in afternoon trading .
Other markets .
U.S. light crude oil for April delivery fell $ 3.31 to $ 106.90 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange after touching an all - time high near $ 112 in electronic trading .
COMEX gold for April delivery added $ 13 to $ 1,012.50 an ounce after hitting an all - time high of $ 1,017.50 an ounce earlier .
Treasury prices rallied , lowering the yield on the benchmark 10 - year note to 3.39 % from 3.44 % late Friday .
Bond prices and yields move in opposite directions .
In currency trading , the dollar fell to a fresh all - time low versus the euro and again touched a more than 12 - year low against the yen .
Years ago , H.L. Mencken noted that 'every election is a sort of advance auction of stolen goods . '
Since then , the tendency for electoral politics to undermine property rights has grown exponentially .
For example , current presidential candidates treat it as a bragging point to claim that the shower of benefits they promise is ' paid for , ' even though that payment steals other people 's property , backed by government 's coercive power .
This widespread violation of America as ' the land of the free ' requires returning to first principles .
A good place to rediscover them is a book by one of America 's most famous authors : James Fenimore Cooper 's The American Democrat .
Cooper 's focus was defending private property rights against abuse by political majorities as necessary to defend our ' right of self - government , ' long before democratic violations took the Brobdingnagian proportions they have now .
His understanding , echoing our founding fathers , that ' vigilance in the protection of principles is even more necessary in a democracy , ' is equally important today .
The rights of property [ are ] an indispensable condition of civilization …
If we would have civilization and the exertion indispensable to success , we must have property ; if we have property , we must have its rights ; if we have the rights of property , we must take those consequences of the rights of property inseparable from the rights themselves .
[ I]t is a great mistake …to take sides with the public , in doubtful cases affecting the rights of individuals , as this is the precise form in which oppression is the most likely to exhibit itself in a popular government .
So long as there is civilization there must be rights of property , and so long as there are rights of property , their obvious consequences must follow .
All that democracies legitimately attempt is …that it shall have no factious political aids .
[ T ] here is the safe and just governing rule … permitting every one to be the undisturbed judge of his own habits and associations , so long as they are innocent , and do not impair the rights of others to be equally judges for themselves .
As property is the base of all civilization , its existence and security are indispensable to social improvement …
The principle of individuality … lies at the root of all voluntary human exertion … because we know that the fruits of our labors will belong to ourselves , or to those who are most dear to us .
It follows that all which society enjoys beyond the mere supply of its first necessities is dependant on the rights of property .
The first great principle connected with the rights of property is its inviolability …
[ A]ll who love equal justice , and , indeed , the safety of free institutions , should understand that property has its rights , and the necessity of rigidly respecting them .
[ M ] an …is privileged to use his own means … in the pursuit of his own happiness , and they who would interfere with him , so far from appreciating liberty , are ignorant of its vital principles .
[ P] roperty is an instrument of working most of the good that society enjoys … it encourages and sustains laudable and useful efforts in individuals .
Property is desirable as the groundwork of moral independence , as a means of improving the faculties , and of doing good to others , and as the agent in all that distinguishes the civilized man from the savage .
As between the public and individuals , therefore , the true bias of a democrat …is to take sides with the latter .
This is opposed to the popular notion , which is to fancy the man who maintains his rights against the popular will an aristocrat …
The habit of seeing the public rule is gradually accustoming the American mind to an interference with private rights that is slowly undermining the individuality of the national character .
With the decline of respect for property rights since Cooper wrote , The American Democrat does n't read like current civics books .
But Americans today would benefit from renewed attention to that ' old school ' approach , rather than the dominant view today , which is to use government power to give majority coalitions whatever they want by blatantly violating the property rights of others .

Washington correspondent
The Pentagon is toying with the idea of black propaganda .
As part of George Bush 's war on terrorism , the military is thinking of planting propaganda and misleading stories in the international media .
A new department has been set up inside the Pentagon with the Orwellian title of the Office of Strategic Influence .
It is well funded , is being run by a general and its aim is to influence public opinion abroad .
Black and white
It has been canvassing opinion within the Pentagon on what it should do .
The options range from the standard public relations stuff - doing more to explain the Pentagon 's role - to more underhand tactics such as e-mailing journalists and community leaders abroad with information that undermines governments hostile to the United States .
These e-mails would come from a .com return address rather than .mil to hide the Pentagon 's role .
The most controversial suggestion is the covert planting of disinformation in foreign media , a process known as black propaganda .
All this has sparked off a fierce debate within the Pentagon .
The options range from " the blackest of black programmes to the whitest of white , " one official told the New York Times .
Some generals are worried that even a suggestion of disinformation would undermine the Pentagon 's credibility and America 's attempts to portray herself as the beacon of liberty and democratic values .
Under review
Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld has asked a team of lawyers to check the proposals ' legality .
The Pentagon is forbidden from spreading black propaganda in the American media , but there is nothing to stop an American newspaper picking up a story carried abroad .
The Pentagon is well versed in what it calls " psyops " , dropping leaflets and using radio broadcasts to undermine enemy morale .
But these kind of activities have always been confined to the battlefield , such as Afghanistan .
Using covert tactics on media outlets of friendly countries is much more controversial .

To make human stem cells , the Newcastle team say they must use the same technique that developed Dolly the sheep
Scientists have created the first part - human , part- animal embryo .
A team at Newcastle upon Tyne University inserted human skin cells into the hollowed - out egg cells of a cow - and jolted the egg into life .
The resulting embryo , which will eventually be used to investigate and treat diseases , survived for three days .
The scientists were only given permission to carry out the controversial experiment in January and the speed of their success has astonished scientists .
It comes a month before MPs vote on a Bill to explicitly make hybrid experiments legal .
Currently , the law is ambiguous .
The Bill is highly controversial and last week Gordon Brown gave in to demands for a free vote on the issue .
The experiments have angered the Catholic Church and other religious leaders , who argue that the research is unnecessary and unethical .
But the Newcastle researchers say it could revolutionise medicine and provide cures for diseases such as Alzheimer 's , Parkinson's , cystic fibrosis and Huntington's .
The team , led by Dr Lyle Armstrong , is trying to find a fast , cheap and reliable way of creating human stem cells .
These are the " parents " of every type of tissue in the human body and , in the right chemical conditions , can be turned into an almost limitless supply brain cells , muscle , skin or bone
To make stem cells , the researchers say they must first create human embryos using the same cloning technique developed for Dolly the sheep .
A single cell is taken from a human donor and its nucleus - containing a complete set of human genes - is removed .
This human DNA is then inserted into an donor egg cell whose own DNA has been sucked out .
The egg is then sparked with electricity and starts to divide and grow .
The resulting embryo is a clone - genetically identical to the donor .
The Newcastle team say they would prefer to use human eggs for the experiments , but they are in too short a supply .
Instead they are using cows ' egg cells .
That means the embryos contain some cow DNA , although they look and behave like normal human embryos .
By law , the embryos have to be destroyed within 14 days of creation - when they are still smaller than a pinhead .
Professor John Burn from Newcastle University said : " This is licensed work which has been carefully evaluated .
" This is a process in a dish , and we are dealing with a clump of cells which would never go on to develop .
" It 's a laboratory process and these embryos would never be implanted into anyone . "
Critics say the Bill legalising creation of hybrids is immoral .
" It is difficult to imagine a single piece of legislation which more comprehensively attacks the sanctity and dignity of human life , " Cardinal Keith O'Brien , archbishop of St Andrews and Edinburgh said last week .
Laptop theft can affect users in more than one way .
Not only do you lose your ( undoubtedly not cheap ) portable computer , you also lose all of the data on it .
Of course , backing up ensures that it 's not actually lost to you , but what about the person who has the laptop ?
Your electronic tax returns , embarrassing videos of yourself singing and dancing to N'Sync songs , and salacious e-mails are all somewhere out there , out of your control .
( I once came into the possession of a laptop that was lost at O'Hare and never claimed , and found all sorts of e-mails on it from the owner who apparently cheated on his wife whenever he traveled .
True story . )
Intel hopes to reduce that level of embarrassment ( and more importantly , identity theft ) by introducing Intel Anti-Theft Technology ( ATT ) later this year .
The technology would involve placing a chip in the machine that would prevent it from booting without the owner 's permission , Intel Mobility Group chief Dadi Perlmutter told The Register , although he declined to go into much more detail .
He also indicated that ATT might one day incorporate tracking technology so that users might eventually be able to get their hardware back .
Intel is n't working on this initiative alone , though .
In fact , a number of third parties announced today that they were partnering up with Intel to support ATT , such as Absolute Software Corporation ( creators of firmware - based data protection / tracking solutions ) , BIOS maker Phoenix , and Utimaco ( a data security company ) , to name a few .
Intel also says that McAfee is on board , as well as manufacturers like Lenovo and Fujitsu .
ATT differs from current disk encryption technology because it would render the laptop useless , even if the hard drive is replaced .
While this may not help the victim get the laptop back ( unless it involves the aforementioned tracking technology ) , if widely adopted , ATT could deter thieves from stealing laptops in the first place if all they would end up with is an inoperable chunk of plastic and metal .
Of course , if users want their data to be secure and for the laptop to be unbootable , it 's probably wise to employ both ATT and some sort of disk encryption technology , in case the hard drive is removed and placed in another machine .
We ( and the Register ) do n't expect to see ATT available to consumers soon , though .
Perlmutter apparently said that it wo n't be available until at least the fourth quarter of the year , and it will take longer than that for manufacturers to incorporate it into their products .
Still , as laptop sales increase , laptop theft is likely to as well .
If the technology works well , then hopefully thieves will eventually learn to look for other , more attractive targets .
DHS chief Michael Chertoff is a keynote speaker at the RSA Conference .
File photo : AP / J. David AkeSAN FRANCISCO –
The federal government has launched a cyber security " Manhattan Project , " U.S. homeland security secretary Michael Chertoff said Tuesday , because online attacks can be a form of " devastating warfare " , and equivalent in damage to " physical destruction of the worst kind . "
Speaking to hundreds of security professionals at the RSA security conference , Chertoff cited last year 's denial - of - service attacks against Estonia , and hypothetical hack attacks on financial networks and air traffic control systems , as proof that a federal strategy was needed .
" Imagine , if you will , a sophisticated attack on our financial systems that caused them to be paralyzed , " Chertoff said .
" It would shake the foundation of trust on which our financial system works . "
That digital mushroom cloud scenario means the government 's role in computer security must extend beyond federal networks , and reach to shared responsibility for financial , telecommunication and transportation infrastructure , Chertoff said .
" The failure of any single system has cascading effects across our country , " Chertoff said .
But Chertoff's talk shed precious little light on the details of the Bush administration 's cyber security plans .
In January , President Bush signed a presidential order expanding the role of DHS and the NSA in government computer security .
Its contents are classified , but the U.S. Director of National Intelligence has said he wants the NSA to monitor America 's internet traffic and Google searches for signs of cyber attack .
Computer security experts ' reaction to the talk was mixed , some happy with the new federal attention and dollars , while others ridiculed it as empty rhetoric .
Chertoff said he did not foresee the government becoming the net 's protector or censor .
" We do n't have to sit on the internet and prevent things from coming in or going out , " Chertoff said , referring obliquely to countries like China that censor the net .
" That 's not what we are going to do . "
Chertoff emphasized that the first order of business was for the feds to get " our own house in order , " , by , among other things , shrinking the number of access points for government computer systems and websites so that intrusion detection software can scan them more quickly .
The Bush administration 's Cyber Initiative has gotten $ 150 million in funding for this year , and the administration is requesting $ 192
million for 2009 .
Chertoff hopes that the government 's new cyber security efforts will lead to technology breakthroughs that it can share with the private sector .
Silicon Valley entrepreneur Rod
Beckstrom was recently named to head that effort .
In fact , Chertoff imagines the government 's cyber security center will transform its current intrusion detection system , named Einstein , into a pre-computer crime detector .
" We might have the ability to understand the signature of an attack before it is launched , " Chertoff said .
" I think it could become an early warning system that might be able to detect an attack before it is coming .
Giving an adversary one bite at the apple before we understand the attack 's meta data , or the code , is one bite too many . "
One side - benefit of better cyber security is less identity and intellectual property theft .
" This is one case where security and privacy are not at odds , " Chertoff said .
They are complementary . "
One prominent security expert declined to speak on the record but ridiculed the notion that the government would develop technology to find attacks before they happen , calling it the " clairvoyance machine . "
More important , he said , was that there was only one DHS employee dedicated to keeping electrical systems safe from attack .
But Ray Kaplan , one of the founders of the RSA conference , said there 's much Chertoff cannot say and that the government does have a role to play , especially in terms of grants for research .
" There is an undercurrent underneath what Chertoff was talking about of people giving the government recommendations , " Kaplan said .
" It is n't just a one - way street . "
One key thing the government could do is get the security industry to release real threat metrics , so that industries can know how prone their industry is to different kinds of attacks .
That information , according to Kaplan , just is n't currently shared and there 's not even a common language for it .

Sgt Peppers revolutionised music on its release in 1967
The seminal record , released in 1967 , topped the poll to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the UK album chart .
" It revolutionised music and what we expect from an album , " said Radio 2's Simon Mayo , which broadcast the full run-down of the top 100 albums .
Just 201 votes separated Sgt Pepper and Michael Jackson 's Thriller , in second .
The Beatles had a total of four albums in the top 10 , with Revolver at six , Abbey Road at eight and The Beatles - also known as The White Album - at 10 .
Best of the rest
Only one album from the last 20 years featured in the top 10 - and that was U2's The Joshua Tree , from 1987 , which came third .
The rest of the places were taken by a string of mid-70s records .
Fourth was Fleetwood Mac's Rumours and fifth was Pink Floyd 's Wish You Were Here .
TOP 10 NUMBER ONE ALBUMS 1 : Sgt Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band - The Beatles 2 : Thriller - Michael Jackson 3 : The Joshua Tree - U2 ( above ) 4 : Rumours - Fleetwood Mac 5 : Wish You Were Here - Pink Floyd 6 : Revolver - The Beatles 7 : Bridge Over Troubled Water - Simon and Garfunkel 8 : Abbey Road - The Beatles 9 : A Night At The Opera - Queen 10 : The Beatles - The Beatles
Over 220,000 people voted in the poll , through websites for both the official charts and Radio 2 .
In all , there have been 787 Number One albums , from Frank Sinatra 's Songs For Swingin ' Lovers - which headed the first ever chart in 1956 - to Christina Aguilera 's Back To Basics , the most recent new best seller .
The most recent release to make it into the top 100 was Madonna 's Confessions On A Dancefloor , at Number 37 , which charted in November last year .
Coldplay 's X&Y and Gorillaz ' Demon Days , both which topped the chart last June , were also included .
" With over 220,000 votes received from the great British public , this is the most definitive record of the nation 's favourite albums to date , " said Darren Haynes of the Official UK Charts Company .
Because several iconic albums never made it to Number
One in the album chart , a " best of the rest " category was also included in the poll .
This was topped by the Pink Floyd album Dark Side Of The Moon - which only made it to Number Two on its release in 1973 .
" The list of Number One albums is instantly interesting because it highlights the fact that such classics as Dark Side Of The Moon , Bat Out Of Hell , Ziggy Stardust and Hotel California failed to reach the Number One slot , " said Mr Haynes .
Who Built the Pyramids ?
The question of who built the pyramids , and how , has long been debated by Egyptologists and historians .
Standing at the base of the pyramids at Giza it is hard to believe that any of these enormous monuments could have been built in one pharaoh 's lifetime .
Herodotus , the Greek historian who wrote in the 5th century B.C. , 500 years before Christ , is the earliest known chronicler and historian of the Egyptian Pyramid Age .
By his accounts , the labor force that built Khufu totalled more than 100,000 people .
But Herodotus visited the pyramids 2,700 years after they were built and his impressive figure was an educated guess , based on hearsay .
Modern Egyptologists believe the real number is closer to 20,000 .
Mark Lehner and Zahi Hawass have been trying to solve the puzzle of where the 20,000 - 30,000 laborers who built the pyramids lived .
Once they find the workers ' living area , they can learn more about the workforce , their daily lives , and perhaps where they came from .
Mark has been excavating the bakeries that presumably fed this army of workers , and Zahi has been excavating the cemetery for this grand labor force .
It is believed that Giza housed a skeleton crew of workers who labored on the pyramids year round .
But during the late summer and early autumn months , during the annual flooding of the fields with water from the annual innundation of the Nile flooded the fields , a large labor force would appear at Giza to put in time on the pyramids .
These farmers and local villagers gathered at Giza to work for their god kings , to build their monuments to the hereafter .
This would ensure their own afterlife and would also benefit the future and prosperity of Egypt as a whole .
They may well have been willing workers , a labor force working for ample rations , for the benefit of man , king , and country .
The following interviews with Mark Lehner and Zahi Hawass address the controversial question of who actually built the pyramids at Giza :
MARK LEHNER , Archaeologist , Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago , and Harvard Semitic Museum
NOVA : In your extensive work and research at Giza have you ever once questioned whether humans built the pyramids ?
LEHNER : No .
But have I ever questioned whether they had divine or super intelligent inspiration ?
I first went to Egypt in 1972 and ended up living there 13 years .
I was imbued with ideas of Atlantis and Edgar Cayce and so on .
So I went over , starting from that point of view , but everything I saw told me , day by day , year by year , that they were very human and the marks of humanity are everywhere on them .
And you see there 's this curious reversal where sometimes New Age theorists say that Egyptologists and archaeologists are denigrating the ancient culture .
They sometimes put up a scarecrow argument that we say they were primitive .
And the New Agers sometimes want to say these were very sophisticated , technologically sophisticated people who built these things , they were not primitive .
Well , actually there 's a certain irony here , because they say they were very sophisticated technological civilizations and societies that built the pyramids and the Sphinx , and yet they were n't the ones that we find .
So to me , it 's these suggestions that are really denigrating the people whose names , bodies , family relationships , tools , bakeries that we actually find .
Everything that I have found convinces me more and more that indeed it is this society that built the Sphinx and the pyramids .
Everytime I go back to Giza my respect increases for those people and that society , that they could do it .
You see , to me it 's even more fascinating that they did this .
And that by doing this they contributed something to the human career and its overall development actually .
Rather than just saying , you know copping out and saying , there 's no way they could have done this .
I think that denigrates the people whose evidence we actually find .
NOVA : Herodotus , the Greek historian , wrote that 100,000 workers built the pyramids and modern Egyptologists come up with a figure more like 20,000 workers .
Can you explain that for us ?
LEHNER : Yeah , well , first of all Herodotus just claims he was told that .
He said , 100,000 men working in three shifts , which raises some doubt , I guess if you read it in the original Greek as to whether it's three shifts of 100,000 men each or whether you subdivide , you know , the 100,000 men .
But my own approach to this stems to some extent from " This Old Pyramid . "
You know , the popular film that was done by NOVA [ where we attempted to build a small pyramid at Giza ] .
And certainly we did n't replicate ancient technology 100 percent because there 's no way we could replicate the entire ancient society that surrounded this technology .
So our stones were delivered by a flatbed truck as opposed to barges .
You know , we did n't reconstruct the barges that brought the 60 - ton granite blocks from Aswan .
So basically what we were doing is , as we say in the film and in the accompanying book , that we 're setting up the ability to test particular tools , techniques and operations , without testing the entire building project .
One of the things that most impressed me , though , was the fact that in 21 days , 12 men in bare feet , living out in the eastern desert , opened a new quarry in about the time we needed stone for our NOVA Pyramid , and in 21 days they quarried 186 stones .
Now they did it with an iron winch , you know , an iron cable and a winch that pulled the stone away from the quarry wall , and all their tools were iron .
But other than that they did it by hand .
So I said , taking just a raw figure , if 12 men in bare feet — they lived in a lean - to shelter , day and night out there — if they can quarry 186 stones in 21 days , let 's do the simple math and see , just in a very raw simplistic calculation , how many men were required to deliver 340 stones a day , which is what you would have to deliver to the Khufu Pyramid to build it in 20 years .
And it comes out somewhere between — I 've got this all written down — but it comes out in the hundreds of men .
Now I was bothered by the iron tools , like 400 men , 4 to 500 men .
I was bothered by the iron tools , especially the iron winch that pulled the stone away from the quarry walls , so I said , let 's put in a team of men , of about say 20 men , so that 12 men become 32 .
And now let 's run the equation .
Well , it turns out that even if you give great leeway for the iron tools , all 340 stones could have been quarried in a day by something like 1,200 men .
And that 's quarried locally at Giza .
You see most of the stone is local stone .
So then because of our mapping and because of our approach where we looked at , what is the shape of the ground here , where 's the quarry , where is the pyramid , let 's see , where would the ramp have run , we could come up with a figure of how many men it would take to schlep the stones up to the pyramid .
Now it 's often said that the stones were delivered at a rate of one every two minutes or so .
And New Agers sometimes point that out as an impossibility for the Egyptians of Khufu 's day .
But the stones did n't go in one after another , you see .
And you can actually work out the coefficient of friction or glide on a slick surface , how much an average stone weighed , how many men it would take to pull that .
And in a NOVA experiment we found that 12 men could pull a 1.5 ton block over a slick surface with great ease .
And then you could come up with very conservative estimates as to the number of men it would take to pull an average size block the distance from the quarry , which we know , to the pyramid .
And you could even factor in different configurations of the ramp which would give you a different length .
Well , working in such ways , and I challenge anybody to join in the challenge , it comes out that you can actually get the delivery that you need .
You need 340 stones delivered you see , every day , and that 's 34 stones every hour in a ten hour day , right .
Thirty - four stones can get delivered by x number of gangs of 20 men , and it comes out to something like 2,000 , somewhere in that area .
We can go over the exact figures .
So now we 've got 1200 men in the quarry which is a very generous estimate , 2,000 men delivering .
And so that 's 3,200 .
OK , how about men cutting the stones and setting them ?
Well , it 's different between the core stones which were set with great slop factor , and the casing stones which were custom cut and set , one to another , with so much accuracy that you can't get a knife blade in between the joints , so there 's a difference there .
But let 's gloss over that for a moment .
One of the things the NOVA experiment showed me that no book could , is just what is it like to have a 2 or 3 - ton block — how many men can get their hands on it ?
Well , you can't have 50 men working on one block , you see .
And you can only get about four or five , six guys at most working on a block , say two on levers , you know , cutters and so on .
And you know , you put pivots under it and as few as two or three guys can pivot it around if you put a hard cobble under it .
There are all these tricks they know .
But it 's just impossible to get too many men on a block .
But you figure out how many stones have to be set to keep up with this rate , to get in with 20 years .
And it actually comes up 5,000 or less men , including the stone setters .
Now the stone setting gets a bit complicated because of the casing , and you have one team working from each corner , and another team working in the middle of each face for the casing and then the core .
And I 'm going to gloss over that .
But the challenge is out there : 5,000 men to actually do the building and the quarrying and the schlepping from the local quarry .
This does n't count the men cutting the granite and shipping it from Aswan or the men over in Tura .
OK , so that increases the numbers somewhat ....
And that 's what things like the ancient technologies series done by NOVA really bring home , I think .
No , we 're not recreating ancient society , and ancient pyramid building 100 percent .
And probably not even 60 percent .
But we are showing some nuts and bolts that are very useful and insightful , far more than all the armchair theorizing .
Now just recently I was contacted by the construction firm DMJM — the initials stand for Daniel , Mann , Johnson & Mendenhall — it 's one of the largest construction firms , they 're working right now on the Pentagon .
And one of the senior vice presidents decided to take on for a formal address for fellow engineers , a program management study of the Great Pyramid .
So these are not guys lifting boilers in Manhattan , these are senior civil engineers with one of the largest construction corporations in the United States .
And I 'm sure they'd be happy to go on record with their study which looked at what they call critical path analysis .
What do you need to get the job done ?
What tools did they have ?
And they contacted me and other Egyptologists and we gave them some references .
Here 's what we know about their tools , the inclined plane , the lever and so on .
And without any secret sophistication or hidden technology , just basically what archaeologists say , this is what these folks had .
DIM JIM came up with 5,000 , 4 to 5,000 men could build the Great Pyramid within a 20 to 40 year period .
And they have very specific calculations on every single aspect , from the gravel , for the ramps , to baking the bread .
So I throw that out there , not because that 's gospel truth , but because reasoned construction engineers , who plan great projects like bridges and buildings today and earthworks and so on , look at the Great Pyramid and do n't opt out for lost civilizations , extraterrestrials , or hidden technologies .
No , they say it 's a very impressive job , extraordinary for the people who lived then and there , but it could be done .
They are human monuments .
NOVA : You 've made reference to inscriptions at Giza that indicate who built the pyramids .
What do the inscriptions say ?
LEHNER : One of the most compelling pieces of evidence we have is graffiti on ancient stone monuments in places that they did n't mean to be shown .
Like on foundations when we dig down below the floor level , up in the relieving chambers above the King 's chamber , and in many monuments of the Old Kingdom , temples , the Sun temples , other pyramids .
Well , the graffiti gives us a picture of organization where crews , where a gang of workmen was organized into two crews .
And the crews were subdivided into five phyles .
The word phyles is spelled p - h - y - l - e -s .
It 's the Greek word for tribe .
The Egyptian word is za .
They were divided into five za's .
In later times when the Greeks came and in bilingual inscriptions , when somebody was translating za into Greek they used the word phyles , the word for tribe , which is extremely interesting actually .
Were these militaristic kinds of conscripts ?
Certainly they were n't slaves .
Could they actually have been natural communities of the Nile Valley kind of contributing like the way the Inca build their bridges and so on ?
..... So the phyles then are subdivided into divisions .
And the divisions are identified by single hieroglyphs with names that mean things like endurance , perfection , strong .
OK , so how do we know this — you come to a block of stone in the relieving chambers above the Great Pyramid .
And first of all you see this cartouche of a King and then some scrawls all in red paint after it .
That 's the gang name .
And in the Old Kingdom in the time of the Pyramids of Giza , the gangs were named after kings .
So for example , we have a name , compounded with the name of Menkaure , and it seems to translate ' the drunks or the drunkards of Menkaure . '
There 's one that 's well attested , actually in the relieving chambers above the Great Pyramid , the Friends of Khufu gang , the Drunks of Menkaura gang , and then you have the green phyles and then the powerful ones .
None of this sounds like slavery , does it ?
And in fact it gets more intriguing .
Because in certain monuments you find the name of one gang on one side of the monument and another gang , we assume competing on the other side of the monument .
You find that to some extent in the temple , the Pyramid temple of Menkaure .
It 's as though these gangs are competing .
So from this evidence we deduce that there was a labor force that was assigned to respective crew gang phyles and divisions .
NOVA : Where did the gangs come from ?
Were they local people or did they travel from afar ?
LEHNER : There 's some evidence to suggest that people were rotated in and out of the raw labor force .
So that you could be a young man in a village say in middle Egypt , and you had never seen more than a few hundred people in your village , maybe at market day or something .
And the King 's men come and it may not have been entirely coercion , but it seems that everybody owed a labor tax .
We do n't know if it was entirely coercive , or if in fact , part of it was a natural community donation as in the Incan Empire for example , to building projects where they had a great party and so on .
But anyway they started keeping track of people and their time on the royal labor project .
And if you were brought from a distance you were brought by boat .
So can you imagine floating down the Nile and say you 're working on Khafre 's Pyramid , and you float past the great pyramid of Meidum and the Pyramids of Dashur , and my God , you 've never seen anything like this .
These are the hugest things .
We 're talking about a society where they did n't have cameras , you did n't see yourself age .
You did n't see great images .
And so here are these stupendous , gigantic things thrusted up to the sky , polished white limestone , blazing in the sunshine .
And then they go on down to Giza and they come around this corner , actually the corner of the Wall of the Crow right into the harbor , and there 's Khufu , the biggest thing on the planet actually in the way of a building until the turn of the century — our century .
And you see , for the first time in your life , not a few hundred , but thousands , probably , of workers and people and industries of all kinds .
And you 're rotated into this experience and you serve in your respective crew , gang , phyles and division , and then you 're rotated out and you go back because you have your own large household to whom you are assigned on a kind of an estate organized society .
You have your own village , maybe you even have your own land that you 're responsible for .
So you 're rotated back but you 're not the same .
You have seen the central principle of the first nation state in our planet 's history , the pyramids , the centralization , this organization .
And so they must have been powerful socializing forces .
Anyway , we think that that was the experience of the raw recruits .
But there must have been a cadre of very seasoned laborers who really knew how to cut stone so fine that you could join them without getting a razor blade in between .
And perhaps they were the stone cutters and setters , and the experienced quarry men at the quarry wall .
And the people who rotated in and out were those doing all the different raw labor , not only the schlepping of the stone but preparing gypsum and we do n't know to what extent the other industries were also organized in the phyles system .
But it 's quite an amazing picture .
And one of the things that really is motivating me now is the question of what vision of society is suggested by a pyramid like Khufu's ?
Was it in fact coercive ?
Was it a militaristic kind of state WPA project ?
Or is it possible that we could find evidence that would bring Egypt into line with what we know of other traditional ancient societies .
Like when the Inca build a bridge , and every household winds its twine together , and the twine of all the households in the village are wound into the villages ' contribution to the rope .
And the rope on the great day of bridge building is wound into a great cable .
And all the villages ' cables are wound into this virtual bridge .
Or in Mesopotamia we know that they built city walls , great mud brick city walls , by the clans turning out and giving their contribution , a kind of organic , natural community involvement in the building project .
I wonder if that was n't the case with the Great Pyramid of Khufu .
You know , it 's almost like an Amish barnraising .
But you know , the Great Pyramid of Khufu is one hell of a barn .
NOVA : Some of the theories of who built the pyramids suggest that the builders may not have been from Egypt .
Can you respond to that ?
LEHNER : One thing that strikes me when I read about these ideas — that it could n't have been the Egyptians who built the pyramids , it could n't have been the Egyptians who built the Sphinx , of the 4th Dynasty , it had to have been an older civilization .
And I think about those claims and then I look at the marvelous statue of Khafre with the Horus falcon at the back of his head .
I look at the sublime ship of Khufu that was found buried south of the pyramid .
And we know that these objects date from the time of Khafre and Khufu , and I think , my God , this was a great civilization .
This was as great as it comes in terms of art and sculpture and building ships from any place in the planet , in the whole repertoire of ancient cultures .
Why is there such a need to look for yet another culture , to say ' No , it was n't these people , it was some civilization that 's lost , even older . '
And to some extent I think we feel the need to look for a lost civilization on time 's other horizon because we feel lost in our civilization and somehow we do n't want to face the little man behind the curtain as you had in " The Wizard of Oz . "
We want the great and powerful wizard with all the sound and fury .
You know , go get me the broomstick of the wicked witch of the west .
We want that sound and fury .
We always want more out of the past than it really is .
ZAHI HAWASS , Director General of Giza
NOVA : Let 's address the question of who built the pyramids .
HAWASS : We are lucky because we found this whole evidence of the workmen who built the pyramids and we found the artisans and Mark found the bakery and we found this settlement of the camp , and all the evidence , the hieroglyphical inscriptions of the overseer of the site of the Pyramid , the overseer of the west side of the Pyramid , the craftsman we found , the man who makes the statue of the overseer of the craftsman , the inspector of building tombs , director of building tombs — I 'm telling you all the titles .
We found 25 unique new titles connected with these people .
Then who built the pyramids ?
It was the Egyptians who built the pyramids .
The Great Pyramid is dated with all the evidence , I 'm telling you now to 4,600 years , the reign of Khufu .
The Great Pyramid of Khufu is one of 104 pyramids in Egypt with superstructure .
And there are 54 pyramids with substructure .
There is support ( that ) the builders of the pyramids were Egyptians .
They are not the Jews as has been said , they are not people from a lost civilization .
They are not out of space .
They are Egyptian and their skeletons are here , and were examined by scholars , doctors and the race of all the people we found are completely supporting that they are Egyptians .
NOVA : The Greek historian Herodotus claimed in 500 B.C. that 100,000 people built the pyramids , and yet modern Egyptologists believe the figure to be more like 20,000 to 30,000 .
HAWASS : Herodotus , when he came here , met guides who tell stories and things like that .
But I really personally believe that based on the size of the settlement and the whole work of an area that we found , I believe that permanent and temporary workmen who worked at building the pyramid were 36,000 .
NOVA : And how do you come to that number ?
HAWASS : I came to that number based on the size of the pyramid project , a government project , the size of the tombs , the cemetery .
We know we can excavate the cemetery for hundreds of years — generations after generation can work in the cemetery — and the second is the settlement area .
I really believe there were permanent workmen who were working for the king .
They were paid by the king and these are the technicians who cut the stones , and there are workmen who move the stones and they come and work in rotation .
You have this group and another group .
In the same time there are the people who live around the pyramids that do n't need to live in the pyramids .
They come by early in the morning and they work fourteen hours from sunrise to sunset .
NOVA : From your excavations of the workers ' cemetery you say you found skeletons .
Did you analyze the bones , and if so , what did you learn about the workmen ?
HAWASS : We found 600 skeletons .
And we found that those people , number one , they were Egyptians , the same like you see in every cemetery in Egypt .
Number two , we found evidence that those people had emergency treatment .
They had accidents during building the pyramids .
And we found 12 skeletons who had accidents with their hands .
And they supported the two sides of the hand with wood .
And we have another one , a stone fell down on his leg , and they made a kind of operation , and they cut his leg and he lived 14 years after that .
NOVA : How do you know that ?
HAWASS : Because we have a team here from the National Research Center who are doctors and they use the x-ray and they can find all the evidence about age .
They found that the age of death for those workmen were from 30 to 35 .
Those are the people who really built the pyramids , the poor Egyptians .
It 's very important to prove how the pyramid was built .
The pyramid you know , has magic , it has mystery .
It 's a structure that was built , you know , 4,600 years ago .
There is no accurate book until now that really explained all of that .
All the theorists , in other books they say that the stones were taken from Tura , about five miles to the east of the pyramid .
This is not true .
All the stones have been taken from the plateau , except the casing stones that came from Tura , and the granite in the burial chamber that came from Aswan .
But the magic of the pyramid makes people think about it .
An amateur comes by and looks at this structure and does n't know the mechanics .
The cult of the Egyptians , the religion , the pyramid , is a part of a whole civilization .
NOVA : There is an inscription above Khufu 's burial chamber that identifies the pyramid as that of Khufu .
Some people claim that is a fake inscription .
Can you comment on that ?
HAWASS : They say that the inscriptions inside the five relieving chambers are fake .
Fine .
I went last week and we lighted all of them .
It has been never lighted before .
We did beautiful lighting .
Then we can read each single inscription .
NOVA : And what do they say ?
HAWASS : The workmen who were involved in building the Great Pyramid were divided into gangs , groups , four groups , and each group had a name , and each group had an overseer .
They wrote the names of the gangs .
And you have the names of the gangs of Khufu as ' Friends of Khufu . '
Because they were the friends of Khufu proves that building the pyramid was not really something that the Egyptians would push .
You know , it 's like today .
If you go to any village you will understand the system of ancient Egyptians .
When you build , I mean a dam , or you build a big house , people would come to help you .
They would work free for you , the households will send food to feed the workmen .
And when they build the houses you will do the same for them .
And that 's why the pyramid was the national project of Egypt because everyone had to participate in building this pyramid .
By food , by workmen , this way the building of the pyramid was something that everyone felt to participate , and really it was love .
They are not really pushed to do it .
When the king takes the throne , the people have to be ready in participating in building the pyramid .
And then when they finish it , they celebrate .
That 's why even now in modern Egypt we still really do celebrations when we finish any project because that 's exactly what happened in ancient Egypt .
NOVA : But what about the incriptions in the relieving chambers in Khufu and the claim that they were not written in the time of Khufu ?
HAWASS : They say that these inscriptions have been written by people who entered inside .
And if you go and see them they are typical graffiti that can be seen around every pyramid in Egypt , because the workmen around the pyramid left this .
I would like those people who talked about this to come with me .
And I will take them personally to the rooms .
First of all they say that only inscribed is the second room — it 's not true .
All the five relieving chambers are inscribed .
Number two , there are some inscriptions there that cannot be written by anyone except the workmen who put them there .
You can not go and reach there .
It has to be the man who put the block above the other one to do that .
I think that maybe the only few Egyptologists , the only two Egyptologists in the world that will really have an open mind , it 's me and Mark Lehner , because we believe the public has the right for us to tell them the truth .
We are really working excavating around the pyramids to tell the world the truth .

The fears over the municipal - bond market in America look overdone .
For the moment , the government should resist the urge to intervene
“ WE WERE not designed or structured to be the most important company in the entire financial system , ” said Jay Brown on February 19th as he returned to MBIA , charged with steadying the company he had run from 1999 to 2004 .
You may think otherwise , given the markets ' fevered concern over the “ monoline ” bond insurers .
Thanks to unwise forays into mortgage - backed securities , an industry that a year ago was basking in profitable obscurity now stands accused of endangering large chunks of the financial system , including Wall Street banks and the huge market for municipal bonds .
With rating agencies preparing to downgrade them to levels that could destroy their business , and regulators pushing for bail - outs or break - ups , the monolines ' moment of truth has arrived .
For anyone linked to the $ 2.4 trillion of securities they have guaranteed , it is nail - biting stuff .
The sense of urgency has increased since Eric Dinallo , the insurance regulator for New York state , stepped up pressure on banks to offer help .
At a congressional hearing on February 14th , Eliot Spitzer , New York 's governor , gave the insurers a few days to strike rescue deals or face government intervention — meaning , probably , forced break - up into good books ( the original “ monoline ” business of backing municipal bonds ) and bad ones ( collateralised - debt obligations and the like ) .
Though no agreement had been reached as The Economist went to press , the industry had begun to embrace radical change .
FGIC , the fourth - largest monoline , filed an application to split itself in two .
Ambac , the second - largest , began work on plans to raise $ 2 billion in capital as a possible prelude to a break - up .
And the rehiring of Mr Brown was seen as a sign that MBIA , too , is thinking the unthinkable .
Some see this as a negotiating ploy .
The monolines know that , by threatening to break apart , they may force Wall Street banks to stump up the cash to keep them whole .
The banks fear that stand - alone structured - product insurers , cut off from the municipal bit , could not pay all of their claims .
This would drag down the value of securities the monolines have guaranteed and increase the banks ' write - downs .
Some also worry that these weakened monolines would be less able to honour credit - default swaps ( CDS ) they had sold to the banks .
Meanwhile , those using CDS to bet on defaults of the monolines themselves are not sure which part of the insurer would be covered in the contract .
Years of litigation could follow a break - up .
Calculating the banks ' potential monoline - related losses is more art than science , and estimates range from $ 7 billion to ten times that .
A new report by Moody 's puts the CDS exposure alone at $ 120 billion for a group of 20 large banks .
In the event of monoline downgrades , the banks may have to raise their counterparty reserves by a combined $ 7 billion - 10 billion , reckons the rating agency , rising to $ 20 billion - 30 billion if the value of hedged securities falls far .
Spread around perhaps two dozen lenders , that number , though big , does not look terrifying .
The regulator and governor are shedding no tears over lenders ' losses .
Their primary concern is the $ 2.6 trillion , tax - exempt municipal - bond market , used by cities , universities and the like to raise long - term funds , much of it from individuals .
Were the monolines to lose their top - notch ratings , they fear , many issuers could struggle to meet higher funding costs .
Municipal borrowers are already being affected by the lack of confidence in the insurers .
Overall issuance was 38 % lower in January than the year before — though other factors , such as the economic slowdown , were also to blame .
Worse , two little - noticed but important bits of the market have imploded this month , and there are fears for a third , known as closed - end municipal - bond funds .
In the first , vehicles sponsored by banks raise short - term money by issuing “ tender option bonds ” ( TOBs ) , then use it to invest in longer - term municipal bonds and the like .
Buyers have fled these programmes , in part because of worries over muni-bond insurance .
The banks behind TOBs are having to buy up the unsold bonds , further straining their balance sheets — though losses should be manageable as the bonds are high - quality .
Problems in “ auction - rate ” securities are causing even more alarm .
In this $ 330 billion market , long - term bonds are , in effect , transformed into short - term ones by having the interest rate reset in auctions every week or month .
The allure for issuers , including hundreds of municipal bodies , is lower interest rates than typical long - term bonds , and the ease of paying down debt if they build up a surplus , by simply taking part in the auction themselves .
This month , however , dozens of auctions have failed as investors have questioned the quality of the assets on offer .
Tens of billions of dollars of bonds went unsold last week .
Dealers , such as Citigroup and Goldman Sachs , have backed away from soaking up unwanted paper .
This has come as a shock to corporate treasurers at firms like Bristol Myers Squibb and US Airways , who piled into auction - rate debt assuming it to be safe .
Because the interest rate automatically clicks up if the auction is a dud , hospitals , museums , universities and ports have suddenly found their debt - service bills rising sharply .
New York state entities ' weekly borrowing costs have climbed by more than $ 2 m , for instance .
Some rates soared to 20 % — though later they fell back to a still high 8 % .
Issuers are scrambling to refinance into proper long - term bonds , or asking banks for letters of credit .
The Treasury has even offered to make it easier for issuers to convert to other types of debt .
Auction - rate bonds may never recover .
That would not be catastrophic .
They are extra gears , engineered by over - achieving bankers , rather than essential market cogs .
May the same be true of bond insurance ?
The crisis shows it is only as good as its underwriters , and they have proved inept .
Moreover , muni bonds are rated using tougher criteria than corporate bonds .
If they were not , most would be almost AAA , reducing the need for insurance .
The more pressing question is whether the government should intervene in any other way than encouraging talks .
There are grounds for scepticism .
As painful as the disruption in municipal markets is , it looks temporary .
Rates fell this week , and high - quality issuers were able to raise finance in municipal - bond markets .
Moreover , there is no supply crisis in the monoline business : Warren Buffett has entered the market ( even offering to take on rivals ' municipal businesses ) and some less - troubled monolines , such as FSA , are grabbing market share .
The monolines ' woes are already largely priced in .
There is scant evidence that leaving their fate to market forces , though it may be painful , would bring down Wall Street banks .
If the banks see the danger growing , they will have even more incentive to find the money to help .
On top of which , a state - mandated break - up could trigger a wave of lawsuits , further eroding trust in the system .
Eager as they are to be seen doing the right thing , Messrs Dinallo and Spitzer should wait to see graver danger than this before they meddle in private contracts .

Reviewing code is a thankless , but very important , task for any software project .
For free software projects , the " many eyes make all bugs shallow " aphorism only works if the eyes actually focus on the code in question .
Review Board is a web - based application that helps reviewers examine the code , while making it easier for a developer to track those reviews .
Borne out of frustration with the process of code reviews at VMware , Review Board has made a great deal of progress since being released last May .
The idea behind it is to centralize all of the pieces that need to come together for a review : code diffs , screenshots of UI functionality , comments by other developers , etc .
On many projects , reviews are handled by email , but that can be difficult to use ; various pieces of the puzzle are spread around in multiple messages and locations .
Often a reviewer needs to see more context than a simple email diff provides or wants to comment on a related section of code that is not contained in the diff ; each requires a reviewer to do more work .
In a complicated set of changes , ensuring that the developer and any other reviewers can follow what code the comments pertain to can also be difficult .
It is these kinds of problems that Review Board is meant to solve .
Review Board presents a side - by - side diff view , shown at right , with lots of extras , many of which will be familiar to users of other graphical diff tools .
Changed lines are highlighted in different colors based on whether they are additions , deletions , or changes .
Changes on a particular line are highlighted in a slightly darker color so that they can be distinguished more easily as well .
The numbered tabs along the left edge provide a link to a reviewer 's comments about that section of the code .
This is where Review Board shows that it is much more than just a diff viewer .
Using AJAX techniques , Review Board allows a reviewer to interact very naturally with the code .
They can highlight a certain section , which will pop up a text widget that records comments associated with that section of code .
When other reviewers or the developer read those comments , the code snippet is included , with a link back to the code in the diff view .
Each of these comments can then be commented upon which allows for a conversation about the code to develop .
It is not just code that can be annotated ; screenshots of application functionality or bugs can be attached to reviews , as well .
Sections of the screenshot can be highlighted and commented upon , as shown at left .
This feature is an excellent example of where a web - based tool can shine ; doing the same task in text - based email would be painful .
Not all projects need it , but those that do will find it quite useful as anyone who has spent time trying to describe a UI problem in email will attest .
Inter - diffs is another useful feature that Review Board provides .
Often in the code review process , several revisions of the original patch are made .
It can be tedious to wade through a large diff , most of which has been uncontroversial ( or resolved earlier ) to get to the changes in the area of interest .
Review Board has the ability to see changes between any two revisions of the patch , which should reduce much of the hassle .
Another thing that Review Board does is to assist in managing code reviews .
When a developer posts something for review , various reviewers can be notified via email .
Review Board keeps track of that information , presenting users with a " dashboard " view of their pending reviews , both those they submitted and those that others have asked them to do .
This high - level overview is the first screen the user sees when they log on to the system , shown at right .
This makes keeping track of work that needs to be done – or who to prod to get a review moving again – much easier .
Currently , Review Board best supports the Subversion and Perforce version control systems ( VCS ) , but support for others , including distributed VCS Mercurial and git , are being actively developed and are usable in their current states .
Released under an MIT license , Review Board is written in Python , using the Django web framework .
Development is hosted at Google Code ; the developers , unsurprisingly , uses the software for internal code reviews .
Other systems to assist in the code review process do exist .
Codestriker is a Perl based web application that has similar aspirations to Review Board .
Also of interest is Python founder Guido van Rossum 's first project at Google : a code review system he calls " Mondrian " .
It is closely tied to Google proprietary code , though , so it seems unlikely to be released as free software – though it might make an appearance as a tool for Google Code projects to use .
Code reviews are very powerful , but generally painful to perform ; any tool that claims that " Code reviews are fun again ! ... almost . " , as Review Board does , will be welcomed by many .
It will be interesting to see whether a code review tracker becomes a standard part of newer free software projects .
Over the last few years , we have seen the rise of distributed VCS , bug trackers , and wikis to assist in distributed development .
Will Review Board – or something like it – be the next tool to be added ?
Promising New Nanotechnology for Spinal Cord Injury |
A spinal cord injury often leads to permanent paralysis and loss of sensation below the site of the injury because the damaged nerve fibers can't regenerate .
The nerve fibers or axons have the capacity to grow again , but do n't because they 're blocked by scar tissue that develops around the injury .
Northwestern University researchers have shown that a nano - engineered gel inhibits the formation of scar tissue at the injury site and enables the severed spinal cord fibers to regenerate and grow .
The gel is injected as a liquid into the spinal cord and self - assembles into a scaffold that supports the new nerve fibers as they grow up and down the spinal cord , penetrating the site of the injury .
When the gel was injected into mice with a spinal cord injury , after six weeks the animals had a greatly enhanced ability to use their hind legs and walk .
The research is published today in the April 2 issue of the Journal of Neuroscience .
" We are very excited about this , " said lead author John Kessler , M.D. , Davee Professor of Stem Cell Biology at Northwestern University 's Feinberg School of Medicine .
" We can inject this without damaging the tissue .
It has great potential for treating human beings . "
Kessler stressed caution , however , in interpreting the results .
" It 's important to understand that something that works in mice will not necessarily work in human beings .
At this point in time we have no information about whether this would work in human beings . "
" There is no magic bullet or one single thing that solves the spinal cord injury , but this gives us a brand new technology to be able to think about treating this disorder , " said Kessler , also the chair of the Davee Department of Neurology at the Feinberg School .
" It could be used in combination with other technologies including stem cells , drugs or other kinds of interventions . "
" We designed our self - assembling nanostructures -- the building blocks of the gel -- to promote neuron growth , " said co-author Samuel I. Stupp , Board of Trustees Professor of Materials Science and Engineering , Chemistry , and Medicine and director of Northwestern 's Institute for BioNanotechnology in Medicine .
" To actually see the regeneration of axons in the spinal cord after injury is a fascinating outcome . "
The nano - engineered gel works in several ways to support the regeneration of spinal cord nerve fibers .
In addition to reducing the formation of scar tissue , it also instructs the stem cells -- which would normally form scar tissue -- to instead to produce a helpful new cell that makes myelin .
Myelin is a substance that sheaths the axons of the spinal cord to permit the rapid transmission of nerve impulses .
The gel 's scaffolding also supports the growth of the axons in two critical directions -- up the spinal cord to the brain ( the sensory axons ) and down to the legs ( the motor axons . )
" Not everybody realizes you have to grow the fibers up the spinal cord so you can feel where the floor is .
If you can't feel where the floor is with your feet , you can't walk , " Kessler said .
Now Northwestern researchers are working on developing the nano - engineered gel to be acceptable as a pharmaceutical for the Food and Drug Administration .
If the gel is approved for humans , a clinical trial could begin in several years .
" It 's a long way from helping a rodent to walk again and helping a human being walk again , " Kessler stressed again .
" People should never lose sight of that .
But this is still exciting because it gives us a new technology for treating spinal cord injury . "

WASHINGTON – For a few feel - good moments on the floor of the U.S. House today , Jackie Speier basked in bipartisan applause as she was sworn in as its newest member .
Her family , supporters and kids cheered as she embraced her new colleagues .
Then , in her first speech in Congress , Speier spoke out about Iraq , and the boos and hoots began from the Republican side of the aisle .
“ When will we get out of Iraq ? ” was the most frequent question she heard , she told the House , while campaigning in the special election she won Tuesday to succeed the late Rep.
Tom Lantos .
“ The process to bring the troops home must begin immediately , ” she said , as several Republicans loudly booed .
Rep. Darrell Issa , a Vista Republican , bolted from his seat and left the floor .
The hoots grew in volume as Speier , a Hillsborough Democrat , continued .
“ The president wants to stay the course and a man who wants to replace him suggests we could be in Iraq for 100 years , ” she said , a reference to Republican John McCain ’s assertion that U.S. forces could be there decades , if they are not under attack .
“ The House is not in order , ” shouted Rep. John Lewis , D - Ga .
Some Democrats applauded .
Speaker Nancy Pelosi banged her gavel .
“ Why are they booing my mother ? ” Speier ’s middle - school daughter Stephanie asked , according to a staffer .
Speier ’s first day in Congress had begun – 29 years after she first ran for the seat .
“ I did n’t expect that sort of reaction , but I ’m not a newbie here , ” Speier , a congressional staffer in the 1970s , said in an interview after the swearing - in .
“ There ’s a lot of polarization .
I heard the boos .
I think it ’s counter - productive to getting things done . ”
A veteran of the state legislature , Speier , 57 , said she would not be a quiet junior member and intended to follow three lessons she learned from her late boss , Rep. Leo Ryan : question the status quo , always listen to the people you represent and always stand up for what you believe in .
Speier was badly wounded in the gunfire that killed Ryan as the Jonestown massacre in Guyana began in 1978 .
She ran but lost in a special election to succeed Ryan in 1979 , launched a long career in San Mateo and Sacramento , and came full circle by winning Tuesday ’s election to Congress .

In work that may one day narrow the gap between speedy , voracious readers and slower , disinterested ones , researchers at New York University ( N.Y.U. ) have determined that three different mechanisms are used to decode the words in a particular sentence .
The three processes : phonics ( a letter by letter sounding out of words ) ; contextual clues ( earlier parts of sentences that help readers anticipate upcoming words ) ; and holistic word recognition , or the physical shape of words .
" It 's obvious that people must use all three kinds of information to read , " says Denis Pelli , an N.Y.U. professor of psychology and neuroscience and senior author of the study published this week in PLoS ONE .
" It was far from obvious that you can turn on and off each of the three kinds of information and that you can attribute a percentage of the reading rate to each . "
Using passages from author Mary Higgins Clark 's murder mystery Loves Music , Loves to Dance , Pelli and study co-author , undergraduate Katharine Tillman , manipulated passages to block readers from using each of the word - deciphering processes .
To muffle context clues , they shuffled words in a sentence ( " contribute others .
The of Reading measured " ) ; discrimination via word shape was covered up by inserting random capital letters ( " ThIS tExT AlTeRnAtEs iN CaSe . " ) ; and to eliminate letter by letter decoding , they substituted similar - looking letters into a word , thereby retaining the ability to use word shape and context , once a reader figured out a previous word ( " Tbis sartcrec bes lctfan suhsfitufas " ) .
In an effort to determine the impact of the absence of each aid , researchers directed 11 subjects to read passages that were either pure text , had one alteration or two of these manipulations combined .
Their findings : that phonics , not surprisingly , the largest component of reading speed , determined 62 percent of the rate .
The stunner was that the other two processes consistently contributed the same amounts to reading speed .
( Context clues controlled 22 percent of reading speed and word shape governed 16 percent , according to the study . )
Pelli says this research paves the way toward better understanding and addressing the deficiencies of young students who fall behind early in reading .
" It 's possible that doing the phonics intervention is the ideal intervention , " he says of the most common type of reading training .
But " it would be interesting to know how phonics is affecting the other two processes rather than just overall reading speed .
We think that it would be very interesting to break down reading rate into these three components in the evaluations of [ possible ] interventions . "
Modules and the next version of Windows
There is a growing consensus of opinion forming that Windows " Seven " will be " modular , " the concept being that you buy the core OS first and then add to it individual " modules " with logically distinct units of functionality .
There are two ways the OS could be modularized in such a fashion , the first being that it could be split into functional " roles , " such as " music " or " movies " or " mail & chat . "
The other option , which is a bit more radical , would be to build on the " Windows Live " software that updates / replaces some of the OS components .
For example , Vista 's Windows Photo Gallery is replaceable with Windows Live Photo Gallery .
The Live version is similar in concept , but includes greater online integration and features .
With both Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008 , we can see the first few steps in this modular direction , albeit in different ways .
Windows Server 2008 has as one of its major features the idea of " roles " .
Rather than installing everything and the kitchen sink , with 2008 , you install the base OS and then choose one or more roles , such as Active Directory domain controller , Web Server , or Print Server , and the software components to support those tasks are installed accordingly .
This " roles " tack has resulted in the now infamous multiplicity of versions of Windows Vista .
If you want Media Center , you need to get Home Premium ; if you want hard drive encryption , you need to get Enterprise ; if you want Aero Glass , you must n't get Home Basic ; if you want everything , you have go get Ultimate .
The differences in capabilities among Vista 's versions are fairly arbitrary ; there is n't actually anything particularly business -y about the full - system image - based backup , for example , but it 's not found in either of the Home versions .
This annoyance is mitigated somewhat by the fact that Vista also made it easy to change between versions .
Unlike the days of XP Home and XP Professional , where reinstalling from scratch was the only way to switch between variants , Vista has Anytime Upgrade , which allows someone with , say , Home Basic to upgrade to Ultimate relatively seamlessly .
Why go modular ?
There are a few motivations behind the modular approach that appears to be Windows ' future .
With Server 2008 , the rationale is that by not installing unwanted services , there is less ( potentially exploitable ) code running on the server , and so the server is more secure .
Similarly , by offering components as " Live " tools , there are fewer antitrust concerns ( they 're no longer bundled with the OS , so Microsoft can't be exploiting its desktop monopoly ) .
But the most compelling reason — for Microsoft , at least — is an economic one .
For a corporation with business - critical Windows - only custom applications , Windows is worth more than it is to a home user who just does a bit of e-mail and web surfing .
The home user is n't really depending on Windows .
It may be what he 's used to , but if push comes to shove , he could always try one of those fruity computers with the funny TV ads that seem to be so trendy .
Many businesses , on the other hand , need to run custom applications ; if they can't , they 're not doing business , and the cost of redeveloping the applications is huge .
The upshot of this is that a business would pay more for its copies of Windows than the home user would because the Windows licenses are more important to the business than to the home user .
With only a single version of Windows , however , everyone has to pay the same price .
This means that the price has to be relatively low , because Microsoft does n't want to scare off the home users to whom Windows is worth relatively little .
Unfortunately for Microsoft , this means that business users can get away paying less for Windows than it 's actually worth to them .
They need to pay only the cheap home user - friendly price , even though they'd be willing to pay more than that if they had to .
To Microsoft , this represents lost revenue ; " lost revenue " that arises from people buying things for less than the highest price they would be willing to pay is called by economists the " consumer surplus . "
If each customer could be charged what they were willing to pay rather than an amount that 's identical for every user then Microsoft would get more revenue .
Normally , though , it 's quite difficult for companies selling commodity products to adjust pricing in this manner .
Companies do n't negotiate a price with each customer ; they ( or " the market " ) set a single price that everyone pays , and they just have to hope that it 's the price that will give them the best trade - off between units sold and revenue per unit .
Spencer Ackerman : " Since he began running for president , Sen. John McCain ( R - Ariz . ) has embraced President George W. Bush 's foreign policy .
He has done so for a simple and understandable reason : it was McCain 's policy first . "
You 'll be reading more on this from me coming soon to a magazine near you , but yes -- Bush 's worst moments have come when he 's embraced an approach to foreign policy that McCain 's been pushing for over ten years now .

U.S. occupation forces have killed more than 800 people , most of them innocent civilians , in their three - week long military campaign to subdue the Mahdi Army in Sadr City , the leader of Sadr movement in Baghdad said .
Sheikh Salaman al - fariji said the troops have also injured more than 1,800 people and caused large - scale destruction of private property and the city ’s rickety infrastructure .
Fariji made the remarks as he accompanied a delegation of 20 members of parliament on a tour of the impoverished city home to more than 2 million people .
U.S. troops have imposed a tight embargo on the city and bombing by war planes and helicopter gun ships in the densely populated Baghdad neighborhood continued even during the MPs ’ tour .
Falah Shanshal , an MP , said the group would write to the parliament to lift the siege of Sadr City and reach a peaceful solution to the standoff with Mahdi Army .
Mahdi Army is the military wing of Sadr movement which has 30 deputies in parliament .
“ The MPs were shocked by the scale of damage , ” said Fariji .
Shanshal said : “ The people of Sadr City undergo horrific humanitarian conditions as a result of U.S. military operations and embargo . ”

A promising new cancer treatment that may one day replace radiation and chemotherapy is edging closer to human trials .
Kanzius RF therapy attaches microscopic nanoparticles to cancer cells and then " cooks " tumors inside the body with harmless radio waves .
Based on technology developed by Pennsylvania inventor John Kanzius , a retired radio and TV engineer , the treatment has proven 100 percent effective at killing cancer cells while leaving neighboring healthy cells unharmed .
It is currently being tested at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston .
“ I do n’t want to give people false hope , ” said Dr. Steve Curley , the professor leading the tests , “ but this has the potential to treat a wide variety of cancers . ”
Modern cancer treatments like radiation and chemotherapy have proven remarkably effective at treating many cancers , especially in combination , but are plagued with toxic side effects .
These treatments kill healthy cells as well as cancerous ones .
Kanzius RF therapy is noninvasive , and uses nontoxic radio waves combined with gold or carbon nanoparticles , which have a long history of medical use .
Since the mid-1980s , scientists have been trying to create new medical therapies to take advantage of their tiny size .
Nanoparticles made of gold , carbon and other materials can move through the bloodstream and through cell walls , allowing for efficient drug delivery , or to act like a homing devices for research purposes .
However , questions about the safety of nanoparticles are largely unanswered .
Nonetheless , the potential of nanoparticles to create novel treatments has become a central thrust of many fields of medicine , including oncology .
At M.D. Anderson , Curley 's research team is working on coating microscopic gold nanoparticles with cancer - seeking molecules .
The proteins act as a filter that ensures nanoparticles attach only to cancerous cells in the body .
“ We ’re looking into gold because it is FDA - approved and has a track record of being tolerated in humans , ” said Dr. Christopher Gannon , assistant professor at the Cancer Institute of New Jersey , who collaborated with M.D. Anderson .
When the gold nanoparticles are inside the malignancy , a blast from a radio - frequency generator causes them to heat and cook the cancer cells .
In trials with animal and human cells , the RF treatment destroyed 100 percent of malignant cells injected with nanoparticles , without harming surrounding healthy tissue .
A study in the November 2007 issue of the journal Cancer showed that tumor cells infused with nanoparticles and exposed to the electromagnetic field of the RF generator died within 48 hours of treatment , with no noted side effects .
A study in the Journal of Nanobiotechnology in January 2008 showed that destruction of human pancreatic cancer cells was 100 percent effective — again producing no noticeable side effects .
“ We know it has the potential to work well , ” said Gannon .
" It ’s just a matter of making the details work . "
The problem is finding cancer - seeking molecules that are attracted to cancer cells but leave healthy cells alone .
Curley 's team has identified a targeting molecule , c225 , which is FDA - approved .
While c225 is present in many cancer cells , it also occurs in healthy cells .
“ It will depend on the type of cancer and the targeting molecules attached to the nanoparticles , ” Curley said .
The radio - frequency generator was invented by Kanzius , who underwent chemotherapy in 2003 and 2004 for leukemia .
Kanzius declined to be interviewed for this story , citing an exclusive agreement with CBS News .
60 Minutes has scheduled a segment about Kanzius RF therapy for Sunday .
“ His device helped inspire us to create the targeted nanoparticles to make it a fully functional clinical device , ” said Gannon .
Kanzius is now working on a larger CT - scanner - sized device that will help scientists test larger subjects by this summer — and pave the way for human trials .
Curley , who described himself as the " ultimate skeptic , " thinks the treatment is only a few years away .
" The best - case scenario is that we would be able to [ start ] clinical trials within three years , ” he said .
When Nanopants Attack
Are Nanobacteria Making Us Ill ?
KARACHI , Pakistan ( CNN ) --
Some of the toughest criticism of Pakistan 's pro-democracy movement comes from an unlikely source : the 25 - year - old niece of Benazir Bhutto , who says Pakistani party politics do nothing but support military rule .
It 's an environment , she said , her late aunt is partly responsible for .
Fatima Bhutto says she 's not interested in " perpetuating a really ineffectual form of politics ... because of my name . "
" At this stage , we are in a state in Pakistan where so - called democratic forces are only interested in coming into office .
So ultimately , they only prop up dictatorships , " she told CNN from her home in Karachi .
She raised her voice as she described what she feels is the core of Pakistan 's political problems : the lack of a true democratic culture .
Instead , she said , the country is run by power grabbers .
" Ultimately to them , it 's a game of revolving chairs .
As long as they get to be in one , they do n't care who 's in the other one . "
Fatima Bhutto said her aunt played this " game of revolving chairs " at huge costs to the Bhutto family , shattering the clan 's unity .
In 1996 , Fatima Bhutto's father , Murtaza Bhutto , was gunned down by Pakistani security forces in front of the family compound .
His sister , Benazir , was prime minister at the time .
His widow blames her sister - in - law for the killing , because Murtaza had become a political rival .
Watch Fatima Bhutto say she 's not " interested in being a symbol " »
" We have to seriously look at her political legacy , which is deeply flawed , " Fatima Bhutto said .
" Both her governments were known for widespread corruption , for an abuse of human rights , and for an excess of police violence . "
Fatima Bhutto was estranged from her aunt and had not spoken to her since Benazir Bhutto returned to the nation for Pakistani elections .
Benazir Bhutto was killed in a bloody December 27 attack .
Her niece says now that Benazir Bhutto has herself been killed , she does not look back in anger .
Watch a struggle over the Bhutto legacy »
" We also have to take into account that Benazir Bhutto died bravely and that the attack on her is ultimately an attack on her country , " she said .
She added that she did attend her aunt 's funeral .
Some here in Pakistan believe Fatima Bhutto -- and not Benazir Bhutto's 19 - year - old son , Bilawal -- is the true heir to the Bhutto political dynasty .
Fatima Bhutto said she 's a political person and does campaign for a splinter group of the Pakistan Peoples Party .
That group is now run by her mother following the death of her father .
She said her main political goal is to empower Pakistan 's largely disenfranchised masses and end what she calls the perpetual cycle of " dynastic " cronyism .
What her role would be in making that happen remains the great unknown .
" What I think we need to do is open the field , " said Fatima Bhutto , who went to college in the United States and graduate school in England .
" It has to stop being this autocratic , dynastic environment .
...
When that day comes and this happens -- that we have an open field -- if there 's a way for me to serve this country , then I would be proud to . "
Until then , she said , she exerts her power from her writing .
Fatima Bhutto is a successful columnist , author and poet ; a staunch critic of Pervez Musharraf 's government .
And though her name would probably propel her to the highest levels of Pakistani politics almost instantly , she said that wo n't happen anytime soon .
" I 'm not interested in being a symbol for anyone , " she said emphatically .
" And I 'm not interested in perpetuating a really ineffectual form of politics simply because of my name . "
She added , " I have never believed in dynastic politics , or the politics of birthright .
... I think that 's dangerous to the cause of democracy in Pakistan , and ultimately does n't serve the people . "

Those who are delighted to try jailbreaking on their Apple devices have been going through quite a rough year .
And this happens because the last good quality jailbreak was released back in July 2016 and it addressed iOS 9.2 up to iOs 9.3.3 .
It was really appreciated , and it represented a great effort from the Pangu team .
However , up until now there ’s been no other jailbreak release , neither from Pangu , nor from TaiG .
The only one who made some efforts in this direction is Luca Todesco , which you can find on Twitter under the name of @qwertyoruiopz .
A Dangerous Jailbreak
It ’s not easy to design a jailbreak suitable for the iOS 10 , and the process is not lacking faults either .
The current beta version of this product made by Luca does n’t work for iPhone 7 and 7 Plus models .
In fact , many devices have been damaged after attempts of installation made on them .
Even more so , the jailbreak is semi-untethered , which means that every time you restart your phone , you have to redo the process all over again .
It may not seem a hard task , but the catch here is that if you redo the process twice in less than a week , you have to re-sign the app , besides re-jailbreaking .
It is indeed quite annoying to do so , and not many people would like to go through all that fuss , especially for a jailbreak that is damaging and unstable .
So What ’s There to Be Done ?
As Todesco tweeted , the only solution for this seems to be waiting for the release of the iOS 10.3 .
He might be expecting to see whether there are new things that can be exploited in the new version in a better manner than in the 10.2 iOS .
Even though the chances that this might be happening are small , there is still hope for jailbreak fans .
There are only a certain number of ways to go crazy , and you can find most of them listed in the psychologist 's bible , the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , currently in its fourth edition and commonly referred to as DSM - IV .
But along with psych - ward greatest hits like schizophrenia and depression , the DSM lists some less - than - common conditions .
1. Trichotillomania
Trichotillomania is a compulsion to pluck one 's hair and often starts around age 12 .
A triichotillomaniac in Michigan says that she first started plucking her eyelashes in first grade .
By fifth grade she had started pulling hair in earnest .
She still does it today , although she over the years she has learned to manage the illness .
" I now am a sales manager managing ten account executives and 30 of the largest accounts in the state of Michigan , "  she writes .
" I have not made less then six figures since I was 24 .
Oh [ yeah ] .
I also suffer from trich [ otillomania ] and have bald spots and no eyelashes ! " 
In rare cases , trichotillomaniacs accumulate hairballs in the intestinal tract by chewing and swallowing the hair they pluck .
You can see an extreme example at the National Museum of Health and Medicine in Washington , D.C. — a huge hairball molded to the shape of a girl 's stomach .
It took six years to form .

2. Othello Syndrome
Othello syndrome is also known as delusional or morbid jealousy — a conviction that your husband / wife / partner is cheating on you .
It often leads sufferers to threaten to attack their spouses or to stalk the imagined lovers of their spouses .
In one case , a woman accused her husband of fathering 10,000 children with a 70 - year - old mistress .
3. Pyromania
Def Leppard 's breakthrough album is named after this rare fixation with fire .
Pyromaniacs do n't set fires to destroy property , collect insurance , or draw attention ; they are attracted to fire itself and may feel tense , aggressive , or piqued before lighting up .
They may even hang out at fire departments or become firefighters so they can focus on fire all the time .
Pyros tend to be men and tend to drink .
Some experts argue that pyromania is a myth , a sexy label attached to mentally ill people who happen to set a fire .
One infamous arsonist who had many characteristics of a pyromaniac was Paul Keller of Seattle , now serving a 99 - year prison sentence .
Keller started setting fires as a child and later tried join the fire department .
An alcoholic , he set over 70 fires in his career , including one at a nursing home .
4. Folie a deux
Folie a deux is a delusion or psychosis shared by several people .
One individual has a genuine mental illness , often schizophrenia , and their otherwise healthy friends or family members take on some of their neuroses .
Psychologists have described families that believe they are infested with invisible parasites , includes Matrix - style robotic bugs .
In one case , a French woman and her husband tried to kill her doctor , presumably for giving her the parasites .
In a similar case , a woman began to see insects crawling her husband .
Then the husband began to see them , too — but when doctors told the two to collect the bugs , they brought in a jar containing hair , thread , and bread crumbs .
Once the husband was separated from his wife , he stopped seeing the bugs .
5. Caffeine Intoxication
The DSM contains a diagnosis for caffeine intoxication , which occurs when you ingest more than 250 milligrams of the stuff , about the amount in two cups of coffee .
Not surprisingly , caffeine intoxication can contribute to panic and anxiety disorders .
6. Internet Addiction
Researchers in Israel have proposed a new diagnosis : internet addition .
" The Internet provides inexpensive , interesting and comfortable recreation , but sometimes users get hooked .
Thus , the computer - internet addiction concept has been proposed as an explanation for uncontrollable and damaging use . "
Sound familiar ?
The DSM also lists several mental syndromes unique to certain cultures and circumstances .
7. Brain fag
Brain fag is a common complaint among West African students .
It 's sort of like " Teacher , my brain hurts , "  accompanied by blurred vision and actual pain in the head or neck .
8. Koro
Koro , says the DSM , is a " sudden and intense anxiety that the penis ( or , in females , the vulva and nipples ) will recede into the body and possibly cause death . " 
Koro does n't just strike one unlucky person ; it hits southeast Asia in waves of a mass hysteria in which everybody becomes terrified of death via genital retraction .

In this article we introduce modern constructive mathematics based on the BHK - interpretation of the logical connectives and quantifiers .
We discuss four major varieties of constructive mathematics , with particular emphasis on the two varieties associated with Errett Bishop and Per Martin - Löf , which can be regarded as minimal constructive systems .
We then outline progress in ( informal ) constructive reverse mathematics , a research programme seeking to identify principles , such as Brouwer ’s fan theorem , that , added to the minimal constructive varieties , facilitate proofs of important analytic theorems .
After a brief discussion of constructive algebra , economics , and finance , the entry ends with two appendices : one on certain logical principles that hold in classical , intuitionistic , and recursive mathematics and which , added to Bishop 's constructive mathematics , facilitate the proof of certain useful theorems of analysis ; and one discussing approaches to a constructive development of general topology .
Constructive mathematics is distinguished from its traditional counterpart , classical mathematics , by the strict interpretation of the phrase “ there exists ” as “ we can construct ” .
In order to work constructively , we need to re-interpret not only the existential quantifier but all the logical connectives and quantifiers as instructions on how to construct a proof of the statement involving these logical expressions .
1. Introduction
Before mathematicians assert something ( other than an axiom ) they are supposed to have proved it true .
What , then , do mathematicians mean when they assert a disjunction \( P \vee Q\ ) , where \ ( P\ ) and \ ( Q\ ) are syntactically correct statements in some ( formal or informal ) mathematical language ?
A natural — although , as we shall see , not the unique — interpretation of this disjunction is that not only does ( at least ) one of the statements \ ( P , Q\ ) hold , but also we can decide which one holds .
Thus just as mathematicians will assert \ ( P\ ) only when they have decided that \ ( P\ ) holds by proving it , they may assert \( P \vee Q\ ) only when they either can produce a proof of \ ( P\ ) or else produce one of \ ( Q\ ) .
With this interpretation , however , we run into a serious problem in the special case where \ ( Q\ ) is the negation , \(
eg P\ ) , of \ ( P\ ) .
To assert \(
eg P\ ) is to show that \ ( P\ ) implies a contradiction ( such as \ ( 0 = 1 ) \ ) .
But it will often be that mathematicians have neither a proof of \ ( P\ ) nor one of \(
eg P\ ) .
To see this , we need only reflect on the following Goldbach conjecture ( GC ) :
Every even integer \ ( \gt 2\ ) can be written as a sum of two primes ,
which remains neither proved nor disproved despite the best efforts of many of the leading mathematicians since it was first raised in a letter from Goldbach to Euler in 1742 .
We are forced to conclude that , under the very natural decidability interpretation of P \( \vee Q\ ) , only a stubborn optimist can retain a belief in the law of excluded middle ( LEM ) :
For every statement \ ( P\ ) , either \ ( P\ ) or \(
eg P\ ) holds .
Classical logic gets round this by widening the interpretation of disjunction : it interprets \( P \vee Q\ ) as \(
eg (
eg P\wedge
eg Q ) \ ) , or in other words , “ it is contradictory that both \ ( P\ ) and \ ( Q\ ) be false ” .
In turn , this leads to the idealistic interpretation of existence , in which \( \exists xP ( x ) \ ) means \(
eg \forall x
eg P( x ) \ ) ( “ it is contradictory that \ ( P( x ) \ ) be false for every \ ( x \ ) ” ) .
It is on these interpretations of disjunction and existence that mathematicians have built the grand , and apparently impregnable , edifice of classical mathematics which serves a foundation for the physical , the social , and ( increasingly ) the biological sciences .
However , the wider interpretations come at a cost : for example , when we pass from our initial , natural interpretation of \( P \vee Q\ ) to the unrestricted use of the idealistic one , \(
eg (
eg P\wedge
eg Q ) \ ) , the resulting mathematics cannot generally be interpreted within computational models such as recursive function theory .
This point is illustrated by a well - worn example , the proposition :
There exist irrational numbers \ ( a , b\ ) such that \ ( a^b\ ) is rational .
A slick classical proof goes as follows .
Either \( \sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}\ ) is rational , in which case we take \( a = b = \ sqrt {2}\ ) ; or else \( \sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}\ ) is irrational , in which case we take \( a = \ sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}\ ) and \( b = \ sqrt {2}\ ) ( see Dummett 1977 [ 2000 ] , 6 ) .
But as it stands , this proof does not enable us to pinpoint which of the two choices of the pair \ ( ( a , b ) \ ) has the required property .
In order to determine the correct choice of \ ( ( a , b ) \ ) , we would need to decide whether \( \sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}\ ) is rational or irrational , which is precisely to employ our initial interpretation of disjunction with \ ( P\ ) the statement “ \( \sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}\ ) is rational ” .
Here is another illustration of the difference between interpretations .
Consider the following simple statement about the set \ ( \bR\ ) of real numbers :
\ [ \tag{*} \ forall x \in \bR ( x = 0 \vee x
e 0 ) , \ ]
where , for reasons that we divulge shortly , \(x
e 0\ ) means that we can find a rational number \ ( r\ ) with \ ( 0 \lt r \lt \abs{x}\ ) .
A natural computational interpretation of ( * ) is that we have a procedure which , applied to any real number \ ( x\ ) , either tells us that \(x = 0 \ ) or else tells us that \(x
e 0\ ) .
( For example , such a procedure might output 0 if \( x = 0\ ) , and 1 if \(x
e 0\ ) . )
However , because the computer can handle real numbers only by means of finite rational approximations , we have the problem of underflow , in which a sufficiently small positive number can be misread as 0 by the computer ; so there cannot be a decision procedure that justifies the statement ( * ) .
In other words , we can not expect ( * ) to hold under our natural computational interpretation of the quantifier \( \forall\ ) and the connective \( \vee\ ) .
Let ’s examine this from another angle .
Let \ ( G( n ) \ ) act as shorthand for the statement “ \( 2n + 2 \ ) is a sum of two primes ” , where \( n\ ) ranges over the positive integers , and define an infinite binary sequence \( \ba = ( a_1 , a_2 , \ldots ) \ ) as follows :
\ [ a_n = \begin{cases} 0 &\text {if } G( n ) \text { holds for all } k \le n \\ 1 &\text {if }
eg G( n ) \text{ holds for some } k \le n \\ \end {cases} \]
There is no question that \ ( \ba\ ) is a computationally well - defined sequence , in the sense that we have an algorithm for computing \( a_n\ ) for each \ ( n\ ) : check the even numbers \ ( 4,6,8 , \ldots , 2n+2\ ) to determine whether each of them is a sum of two primes ; in that case , set \( a_n = 0\ ) , and in the contrary case , set \( a_n = 1 \ ) .
Now consider the real number whose \( n\ ) th binary digit is \( a_n\ ) :
\ [ \begin{align*} x &= ( 0 \cdot a_1 a_2 \cdots ) _{ 2 } \\ &= 2 ^{ - 1}a_1 + 2 ^{- 2}a_2 + \cdots \\ &=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} 2^{-n}a_n. \end{align*}\ ]
If (* ) holds under our computational interpretation , then we can decide between the following two alternatives :
\( 2^{ - 1}a_1 + 2 ^{ - 2}a_2 + \ cdots = 0\ ) , which implies that \( a_n = 0\ ) for every \ ( n\ ) ;
we can find a positive integer \ ( N\ ) such that \( 2 ^ { - 1}a_1 + 2 ^{- 2}a_2 + \cdots \gt 2 ^ {- N}\ ) .
In the latter case , by testing \( a_1 , \ldots , a_N\ ) , we can find \ ( n \le N\ ) such that \( a_n = 1 \ ) .
Thus the computational interpretation of ( * ) enables us to decide whether there exists \ ( n\ ) such that \( a_n = 1 \ ) ; in other words , it enables us to decide the status of the Goldbach Conjecture .
An example of this type , showing that a constructive proof of some classical result \ ( P\ ) would enable us to solve the Goldbach conjecture ( and , by similar arguments , many other hitherto open problems , such as the Riemann hypothesis ) , is called a Brouwerian example for , or even a Brouwerian counterexample to , the statement \( P\ ) ( though it is not a counterexample in the normal sense of that word ) .
The use of the Goldbach Conjecture here is purely dramatic .
For , the argument of the preceding paragraph can be modified to show that , under our computational interpretation , ( * ) implies the limited principle of omniscience ( LPO ) :
For each binary sequence \( ( a_1 , a_2 , \ldots ) \ ) either \( a_n = 0\ ) for all \ ( n\ ) or else there exists \ ( n\ ) such that \( a_n = 1 \ ) ,
which is generally regarded as an essentially nonconstructive principle for several reasons .
First , its recursive interpretation ,
There is a recursive algorithm which , applied to any recursively defined binary sequence \( ( a_1 , a_2 , \ldots ) \ ) , outputs 0 if \( a_n = 0\ ) for all \ ( n\ ) , and outputs 1 if \( a_n = 1\ ) for some \ ( n\ ) ,
is provably false within recursive function theory , even with classical logic ( see Bridges & Richman [ 1987 ] , Chapter 3 ) ; so if we want to allow a recursive interpretation of all our mathematics , then we can not use LPO .
Secondly , there is a model theory ( Kripke models ) in which it can be shown that LPO is not constructively derivable ( Bridges & Richman [ 1987 ] , Chapter 7 ) .
2. The Constructive Interpretation of Logic
It should , by now , be clear that a full - blooded computational development of mathematics disallows the idealistic interpretations of disjunction and existence upon which most classical mathematics depends .
In order to work constructively , we need to return from the classical interpretations to the natural constructive ones :
\( \vee\ ) ( or ) : to prove \( P \vee Q\ ) we must either have a proof of \ ( P\ ) or have a proof of \ ( Q\ ) .
\( \wedge\ ) ( and ) : to prove \( P \wedge Q\ ) we must have both a proof of \ ( P\ ) and a proof of \ ( Q\ ) . \( \Rightarrow\ ) ( implies ) : a proof of \( P \rightarrow Q\ ) is an algorithm that converts any proof of \ ( P\ ) into a proof of \ ( Q\ ) . \(
eg\ ) ( not ) : to prove \(
eg P\ ) we must show that \ ( P\ ) implies \ ( 0 = 1 \ ) .
\( \exists\ ) ( there exists ) : to prove \( \exists xP ( x ) \ ) we must construct an object \ ( x\ ) and prove that \ ( P( x ) \ ) holds .
\( \forall\ ) ( for each / all ) : a proof of \( \forall x\in S P( x ) \ ) is an algorithm that , applied to any object \ ( x\ ) and to the data proving that \( x\in S\ ) , proves that \ ( P( x ) \ ) holds .
These BHK - interpretations ( the name reflects their origin in the work of Brouwer , Heyting , and Kolmogorov ) can be made more precise using Kleene ’s notion of realizability ; see ( Dummett [ 1977/2000 ] , 222–234 ; Beeson [ 1985 ] , Chapter VII ) .
What sort of things are we looking for if we are serious about developing mathematics in such a way that when a theorem asserts the existence of an object \ ( x\ ) with a property \ ( P\ ) , then the proof of the theorem embodies algorithms for constructing \ ( x\ ) and for demonstrating , by whatever calculations are necessary , that \ ( x\ ) has the property \ ( P\ ) .
Here are some examples of theorems , each followed by an informal description of the requirements for its constructive proof .
For each real number \ ( x\ ) , either \( x = 0 \ ) or \(x
e 0\ ) .
Proof requirement :
An algorithm which , applied to a given real number \ ( x\ ) , decides whether \(x = 0 \ ) or \(x
e 0\ ) .
Note that , in order to make this decision , the algorithm might use not only the data describing \ ( x\ ) but also the data showing that \ ( x\ ) is actually a real number .
Each nonempty subset \ ( S\ ) of \( \bR\ ) that is bounded above has a least upper bound .
Proof requirement :
An algorithm which , applied to a set \ ( S\ ) of real numbers , a member \( s\ ) of \ ( S\ ) , and an upper bound for \ ( S\ ) , computes an object \ ( b\ ) and shows that \ ( b\ ) is a real number ; shows that \(x \le b\ ) for each \(x \ in S\ ) ; and given a real number \ ( b ' \lt b\ ) , computes an element \ ( x\ ) of \ ( S\ ) such that \(x \gt b'\ ) .
If \( f\ ) is a continuous real - valued mapping on the closed interval \ ( [ 0,1 ] \ ) such that \ ( f ( 0 ) \cdot f( 1 ) \lt 0\ ) , then there exists \ ( x\ ) such that \ ( 0 \lt x \lt 1\ ) and \ ( f( x ) = 0 \ ) .
Proof requirement :
An algorithm which , applied to the function \ ( f\ ) , a modulus of continuity for \ ( f\ ) , and the values \ ( f( 0 ) \ ) and \ ( f ( 1 ) \ ) , computes an object \ ( x\ ) and shows that \ ( x\ ) is a real number between 0 and 1 ; and shows that \ ( f ( x ) = 0 \ ) .
If \( f\ ) is a continuous real - valued mapping on the closed interval \ ( [ 0,1 ] \ ) such that \ ( f ( 0 ) \cdot f( 1 ) \lt 0\ ) , then for each \( \varepsilon \gt 0\ ) there exists \ ( x\ ) such that \ ( 0 \lt x \lt 1\ ) and \ ( \abs{f ( x ) } \lt \varepsilon\ ) .
Proof requirement :
An algorithm which , applied to the function \ ( f\ ) , a modulus of continuity for \ ( f\ ) , the values \ ( f( 0 ) \ ) and \ ( f ( 1 ) \ ) , and a positive number \( \varepsilon\ ) , computes an object \ ( x\ ) and shows that \ ( x\ ) is a real number between 0 and 1 ; and shows that \ ( \abs{f ( x ) } \lt \varepsilon\ ) .
We already have reasons for doubting that ( A ) has a constructive proof .
If the proof requirements for ( B ) can be fulfilled , then , given any mathematical statement \ ( P\ ) , we can apply our proof of ( B ) to compute a rational approximation \ ( z\ ) to the supremum \( \sigma\ ) of the set
\[ S = \{0\} \cup \{x \in \bR : P \wedge x = 1\} \]
with error \ ( \lt \bfrac { 1} { 4}\ ) .
We can then determine whether \ ( z \gt \bfrac { 1 } { 4}\ ) , in which case \( \sigma \gt 0\ ) , or \(z \lt \bfrac { 3 } { 4}\ ) , when \( \sigma \lt 1 \ ) .
In the first case , there exists \(x \in S\ ) with \ (x \gt 0\ ) , so we must have \(x = 1 \ ) and therefore \ ( P\ ) .
In the case \( \sigma \lt 1\ ) , we have \(
eg P\ ) .
Thus ( B ) implies the law of excluded middle .
However , in Bishop ’s constructive theory of the real numbers , based on Cauchy sequences with a preassigned convergence rate , we can prove the following constructive least - upper - bound principle :
Let \ ( S\ ) be a nonempty subset of \ ( \bR\ ) that is bounded above .
Then \ ( S\ ) has a least upper bound if and only if it is upper - order located , in the sense that for all real numbers \( \alpha , \ beta\ ) with \ ( \alpha \lt \ beta\ ) , either \( \beta\ ) is an upper bound for \ ( S\ ) or else there exists \( x \in S\ ) with \(x \gt \alpha\ ) ( Bishop & Bridges [ 1985 ] , p. 37 , Proposition ( 4.3 ) ) .
In passing , we mention an alternative development of the constructive theory of \ ( \bR\ ) based on interval arithmetic ; see Chapter 2 of Bridges & Vîță [ 2006 ] .
Each of statements ( C ) and ( D ) , which are classically equivalent , is a version of the Intermediate Value Theorem .
In these statements , a modulus of continuity for \ ( f\ ) is a set \( \Omega\ ) of ordered pairs \(( \varepsilon , \delta ) \ ) of positive real numbers with the following two properties :
for each \( \varepsilon \gt 0\ ) there exists \ ( \delta \gt 0\ ) such that \(( \varepsilon , \delta ) \ in \ Omega\ )
for each \(( \varepsilon , \ delta ) \ in \ Omega\ ) , and for all \(x , y \in [ 0,1 ] \ ) with \ ( \abs{x - y} \lt \delta\ ) , we have \( \abs{f ( x ) - f(y ) } \lt \varepsilon\ ) .
Statement ( C ) entails another essentially nonconstructive principle , the lesser limited principle of omniscience ( LLPO ) :
For each binary sequence \( ( a_1 , a_2 , \ldots ) \ ) with at most one term equal to 1 , either \( a_n = 0\ ) for all even \ ( n\ ) or else \( a_n = 0\ ) for all odd \ ( n\ ) .
Statement ( D ) , a weak form of ( C ) , can be proved constructively , using an interval - halving argument of a standard type .
The following stronger constructive intermediate value theorem , which suffices for most practical purposes , is proved using an approximate - interval - halving argument :
Let \( f\ ) be a continuous real - valued mapping on the closed interval \ ( [ 0,1 ] \ ) such that \ ( f ( 0 ) \cdot f( 1 ) \lt 0\ ) .
Suppose also that \ ( f\ ) is locally nonzero , in the sense that for each \(x \in [ 0,1 ] \ ) and each \(r \gt 0\ ) , there exists \ ( y\ ) such that \( \abs{x - y} \lt r\ ) and \ ( f(y )
e 0\ ) .
Then there exists \ ( x\ ) such that \ ( 0 \lt x \lt 1\ ) and \ ( f( x ) = 0 \ ) .
The situation of the intermediate value theorem is typical of many in constructive analysis , where we find one classical theorem with several constructive versions , some or all of which may be equivalent under classical logic .
There is one omniscience principle whose constructive status is less clear than that of LPO and LLPO — namely , Markov ’s principle ( MP ) :
For each binary sequence \ ( ( a_n ) \ ) , if it is contradictory that all the terms \ ( a_n\ ) equal 0 , then there exists a term equal to 1 .
This principle is equivalent to a number of simple classical propositions , including the following :
For each real number \ ( x\ ) , if it is contradictory that \ ( x\ ) equal 0 , then \(x
e 0\ ) ( in the sense we mentioned earlier ) .
For each real number \ ( x\ ) , if it is contradictory that \ ( x\ ) equal 0 , then there exists \(y \ in \bR\ ) such that \( xy = 1 \ ) .
For each one - one continuous mapping \(f : [ 0,1 ] \rightarrow \bR\ ) , if \(x
e y\ ) , then \( f ( x )
e f(y ) \ ) .
Markov ’s principle represents an unbounded search : if you have a proof that all terms \( a_n\ ) being 0 leads to a contradiction , then , by testing the terms \( a_1 , a_2 , a_3 , \ldots \ ) in turn , you are guaranteed to come across a term equal to 1 ; but this guarantee does not extend to an assurance that you will find the desired term before the end of the universe .
Most practitioners of constructive mathematics view Markov ’s principle with at least suspicion , if not downright disbelief .
Such views are reinforced by the observation that there is a Kripke Model showing that MP is not constructively derivable ( Bridges & Richman [ 1987 ] , 137–138 . )
3. Varieties of Constructive Mathematics
The desire to retain the possibility of a computational interpretation is one motivation for using the constructive reinterpretations of the logical connectives and quantifiers that we gave above ; but it is not exactly the motivation of the pioneers of constructivism in mathematics .
In this section we look at some of the different approaches to constructivism in mathematics over the past 130 years .
3.1 Intuitionistic Mathematics
In the late nineteenth century , certain individuals — most notably Kronecker and Poincaré — had expressed doubts about , or even disapproval of , the idealistic , nonconstructive methods used by some of their contemporaries ; but it is in the polemical writings of L.E.J. Brouwer ( 1881 –1966 ) , beginning with his Amsterdam doctoral thesis , Brouwer [ 1907 ] , and continuing over the next forty - seven years , that the foundations of a precise , systematic approach to constructive mathematics were laid .
In Brouwer ’s philosophy , known as intuitionism , mathematics is a free creation of the human mind , and an object exists if and only if it can be ( mentally ) constructed .
If one takes that philosophical stance , then one is inexorably drawn to the foregoing constructive interpretation of the logical connectives and quantifiers : for how could a proof of the impossibility of the non-existence of a certain object \ ( x\ ) describe a mental construction of \ ( x \ ) ?
Brouwer was not the clearest expositor of his ideas , as is shown by the following quotation :
Mathematics arises when the subject of two - ness , which results from the passage of time , is abstracted from all special occurrences .
The remaining empty form [ the relation of \ ( n\ ) to \ ( n+1\ ) ] of the common content of all these two - nesses becomes the original intuition of mathematics and repeated unlimitedly creates new mathematical subjects .
( quoted in Kline [ 1972 ] , 1199 –2000 )
A modern version of Brouwer ’s view was given by Errett Bishop ( Bishop [ 1967 ] , p. 2 ) :
The primary concern of mathematics is number , and this means the positive integers .
We feel about number the way Kant felt about space .
The positive integers and their arithmetic are presupposed by the very nature of our intelligence and , we are tempted to believe , by the very nature of intelligence in general .
The development of the positive integers from the primitive concept of the unit , the concept of adjoining a unit , and the process of mathematical induction carries complete conviction .
In the words of Kronecker , the positive integers were created by God .
However obscure Brouwer ’s writings could be , one thing was always clear : for him , mathematics took precedence over logic .
One might say , as Hermann Weyl did in the following passage , that Brouwer saw classical mathematics as flawed precisely in its use of classical logic without reference to the underlying mathematics :
According to [ Brouwer ’s ] view and reading of history , classical logic was abstracted from the mathematics of finite sets and their subsets .
…
Forgetful of this limited origin , one afterwards mistook that logic for something above and prior to all mathematics , and finally applied it , without justification , to the mathematics of infinite sets .
This is the Fall and original sin of set theory , for which it is justly punished by the antinomies .
It is not that such contradictions showed up that is surprising , but that they showed up at such a late stage of the game .
( Weyl [ 1946 ] )
In particular , this misuse of logic led to nonconstructive existence proofs which , in Weyl ’s words , “ inform the world that a treasure exists without disclosing its location ” .
In order to describe the logic used by the intuitionist mathematician , it was necessary first to analyse the mathematical processes of the mind , from which analysis the logic could be extracted .
In 1930 , Brouwer ’s most famous pupil , Arend Heyting , published a set of formal axioms which so clearly characterise the logic used by the intuitionist that they have become universally known as the axioms for intuitionistic logic ( Heyting [ 1930 ] ) .
These axioms captured the informal BHK - interpretation of the connectives and quantifiers that we gave earlier .
Intuitionistic mathematics diverges from other types of constructive mathematics in its interpretation of the term “ sequence ” .
Normally , a sequence in constructive mathematics is given by a rule which determines , in advance , how to construct each of its terms ; such a sequence may be said to be lawlike or predeterminate .
Brouwer generalised this notion of a sequence to include the possibility of constructing the terms one - by - one , the choice of each term being made freely , or subject only to certain restrictions stipulated in advance .
Most manipulations of sequences do not require that they be predeterminate , and can be performed on these more general free choice sequences .
Thus , for the intuitionist , a real number \( \bx = ( x_1 , x_2 , \ldots ) \ ) — essentially , a Cauchy sequence of rational numbers — need not be given by a rule : its terms \ ( x_1 , x_2 , \ldots \ ) , are simply rational numbers , successively constructed , subject only to some kind of Cauchy restriction such as the following one used by Bishop [ 1967 ] :
\ [ \forall m\forall n \left [ \abs{x_m - x_n} \le \left ( \frac { 1}{m} + \ frac{1}{n}\right ) \right ] \]
Once free choice sequences are admitted into mathematics , so , perhaps to one ’s initial surprise , are certain strong choice principles .
Let \( P\ ) be a subset of \( \bN^{\bN} \times \bN\ ) ( where \( \bN\ ) denotes the set of natural numbers and , for sets \ ( A\ ) and \ ( B , B^A\ ) denotes the set of mappings from \ ( A\ ) into \ ( B ) \ ) , and suppose that for each \( \ba \in \bN^{\bN}\ ) there exists \( n \in \bN\ ) such that \( ( \ba , n ) \ in P\ ) .
From a constructive point of view , this means that we have a procedure , applicable to sequences , that computes \ ( n\ ) for any given \( \ba\ ) .
According to Brouwer , the construction of an element of \ ( \bN^{\bN}\ ) is forever incomplete : a generic sequence \( \ba\ ) is purely extensional , in the sense that at any given moment we can know nothing about \ ( \ba\ ) other than a finite set of its terms .
It follows that our procedure must be able to calculate , from some finite initial sequence \(( a_0 , \ldots , a_N ) \ ) of terms of \ ( \ba\ ) , a natural number \ ( n\ ) such that \ ( P( \ba , n ) \ ) .
If \( \bb \in \bN^{\bN}\ ) is any sequence such that \( b_{k} = a_{k}\ ) for \ ( 0 \le k \le N\ ) , then our procedure must return the same \ ( n\ ) for \ ( \bb\ ) as it does for \( \ba\ ) .
This means that \ ( n\ ) is a continuous function of \ ( \ba\ ) with respect to the topology on \ ( \bN^{\bN}\ ) given by the metric
\ [ \varrho : ( \ba , \bb ) \rightsquigarrow \inf \ { 2 ^{ - n} : a_k = b_k \text{ for } 0 \le k \le n\} . \]
We are therefore led to the following principle of continuous choice , which we divide into a continuity part and a choice part .
CC1 : Any function from \ ( \bN^{\bN}\ ) to \ ( \bN\ ) is continuous .
CC2 : If \( P \subseteq \bN^{\bN} \times \bN\ ) , and for each \( \ba \in \bN^{\bN}\ ) there exists \( n \in \bN\ ) such that \( ( \ba , n ) \ in P\ ) , then there is a function \(f : \bN^{\bN} \rightarrow \bN\ ) such that \( ( \ba , f( \ba ) ) \ in P\ ) for all \( \ba \ in \bN^{\bN}\ ) .
If \( P\ ) and \ ( f\ ) are as in CC2 , then we say that \( f\ ) is a choice function for \ ( P\ ) .
The omniscience principles LPO and LLPO are demonstrably false under the hypotheses CC1 – 2 ; but MP is consistent with it .
Among the remarkable consequences of CC1 –2 are the following .
Any function from \ ( \bN^{\bN}\ ) or \ ( 2 ^{\bN}\ ) to a metric space is pointwise continuous .
Every mapping from a nonempty complete separable metric space to a metric space is pointwise continuous .
Every map from the real line \ ( \bR\ ) to itself is pointwise continuous .
Let \ ( X\ ) be a complete separable normed space , \( Y\ ) a normed space , and \(( u_n ) \ ) a sequence of linear mappings from \ ( X\ ) to \( Y\ ) such that for each unit vector \ ( x\ ) of \ ( X\ ) , \[ \ phi(x ) = \sup\ { \ Vert u_n ( x ) \rVert : n \in \ bN \} \ ] exists .
Then there exists \( c \gt 0\ ) such that \( \lVert u_n ( x ) \rVert \le c\ ) for all \ ( n\in \bN\ ) and all unit vectors \ ( x\ ) of \( X\ ) ( Uniform boundedness principle ) .
Each of these statements appears to contradict known classical theorems .
However , the comparison with classical mathematics should not be made superficially : in order to understand that there is no real contradiction here , we must appreciate that the meaning of such terms as “ function ” and even “ real number ” in intuitionistic mathematics is quite different from that in the classical setting .
( In practice , intuitionistic mathematics cannot be compared , readily and directly , with classical mathematics . )
Brouwer ’s introspection over the nature of functions and the continuum led him to a second principle , which , unlike that of continuous choice , is classically valid .
This principle requires a little more background for its explanation .
For any set \ ( S\ ) we denote by \ ( S^*\ ) the set of all finite sequences of elements of \ ( S\ ) , including the empty sequence \( (\ ) \ ) .
If \( \alpha = ( a_1 , \ldots , a_n ) \ ) is in \ ( S^*\ ) , then \( n\ ) is called the length of \ ( \alpha\ ) and is denoted by \( \abs{\alpha}\ ) .
If \(m \in \bN\ ) , and \( \alpha\ ) is a finite or infinite sequence in \ ( S\ ) of length at least \ ( m\ ) , then we denote by \( \bar{\alpha} ( m ) \ ) the finite sequence consisting of the first \ ( m\ ) terms of \( \alpha\ ) .
Note that \( \bar{\alpha} ( 0 ) = ( \ ) \ ) and \( \abs{\bar{\alpha} ( 0 ) }\ ) = 0 . If \( \alpha \ in S^*\ ) and \( \beta = \ bar{\alpha} ( m ) \ ) for some \ ( m\ ) , we say that \( \alpha\ ) is an extension of \ ( \beta\ ) , and that \( \beta\ ) is a restriction of \( \alpha\ ) .
A subset \( \sigma\ ) of \ ( S\ ) is said to be detachable ( from \( S ) \ ) if
\ [ \forall x\in S ( x \in \sigma \vee x
ot \in \ sigma ) . \]
A detachable subset \( \sigma\ ) of \ ( \bN^*\ ) is called a fan if
it is closed under restriction : for each \( \alpha \in \bN^ *\ ) and each \ ( n\ ) , if \( \bar{\alpha} ( n ) \ in S\ ) , then \( \bar{\alpha} ( k ) \ in S\ ) whenever \ ( 0 \le k \le n\ ) ; and
for each \ ( \alpha \ in \ sigma\ ) , the set \[ \{ \alpha^ * n \in S : n \in \ bN \} \ ] is finite or empty , where \( \alpha^ * n\ ) denotes the finite sequence obtained by adjoining the natural number \ ( n\ ) to the terms of \( \alpha\ ) .
A path in a fan \( \sigma\ ) is a sequence \ ( \alpha\ ) , finite or infinite , such that \( \bar{\alpha} ( n ) \ in \ sigma\ ) for each applicable \ ( n\ ) .
We say that a path \ ( \alpha\ ) is blocked by a subset \ ( B\ ) if some restriction of \ ( \alpha\ ) is in \ ( B\ ) ; if no restriction of \ ( \alpha\ ) is in \ ( B\ ) , we say that \( \alpha\ ) misses \ ( B\ ) .
A subset \ ( B\ ) of a fan \( \sigma\ ) is called a bar for \( \sigma\ ) if each infinite path of \( \sigma\ ) is blocked by \ ( B\ ) ; a bar \ ( B\ ) for \( \sigma\ ) is uniform if there exists \( n \in \bN\ ) such that each path of length \ ( n\ ) is blocked by \ ( B\ ) .
At last we can state Brouwer ’s next principle of intuitionism , the fan theorem for detachable bars ( FT \( _D\ ) ) :
Every detachable bar of a fan is uniform .
In its classical contrapositive form , FT \( _D\ ) is known as König ’s Lemma : if for every \ ( n\ ) there exists a path of length \ ( n\ ) that misses \ ( B\ ) , then there exists an infinite path that misses \( B\ ) ( see Dummett 1977 [ 2000 ] , 49 –53 ) .
( Of course , classically the condition of detachability is superfluous . )
It is simple to construct a Brouwerian counterexample to König ’s Lemma .
Brouwer actually posited the fan theorem without the restriction of detachability of the bar .
Attempts to prove that more general fan theorem constructively rely on an analysis of how we could know that a subset is a bar , and led Brouwer to a notion of bar induction ; this is discussed in Section 3.6 of the entry on intuitionism in the philosophy of mathematics ; another good reference for bar induction is van Atten ( 2004 ) .
We shall return to fan theorems in Section 4 .
Of the many applications of Brouwer ’s principles , the most famous is his uniform continuity theorem ( which follows from the pointwise continuity consequences of CC1 - 2 together a form of fan theorem more general than FT \( _D ) \ ) :
Every mapping from a compact ( that is , complete , totally bounded ) metric space into a metric space is uniformly continuous .
The reader is warned once again to interpret this carefully within Brouwer ’s intuitionistic framework , and not to jump to the erroneous conclusion that intuitionism contradicts classical mathematics .
It is more sensible to regard the two types of mathematics as incomparable .
For further discussion , see the entry on intuitionistic logic .
Unfortunately — and perhaps inevitably , in the face of opposition from mathematicians of such stature as Hilbert — Brouwer ’s intuitionist school of mathematics and philosophy became more and more involved in what , at least to classical mathematicians , appeared to be quasi-mystical speculation about the nature of constructive thought , to the detriment of the practice of constructive mathematics itself .
This unfortunate polarisation between the Brouwerians and the Hilbertians culminated in the notorious Grundlagenstreit of the 1920s , details of which can be found in the Brouwer biographies by van Dalen [ 1999 , 2005 ] and van Stigt [ 1990 ] .
3.2 Recursive Constructive Mathematics
In the late 1940s , the Russian mathematician A.A. Markov began the development of an alternative form of constructive mathematics ( RUSS ) , which is , essentially , recursive function theory with intuitionistic logic ( Markov [ 1954 ] , Kushner [ 1985 ] ) .
In this variety the objects are defined by means of Gödel - numberings , and the procedures are all recursive ; the main distinction between RUSS and the classical recursive analysis developed after the work of Turing , Church , and others in 1936 clarified the nature of computable processes is that the logic used in RUSS is intuitionistic .
One obstacle faced by the mathematician attempting to come to grips with RUSS is that , being expressed in the language of recursion theory , it is not easily readable ; indeed , on opening a page of Kushner ’s excellent lectures [ 1985 ] , one might be forgiven for wondering whether this is analysis or logic .
( This remark should be tempered with reference to the two relatively readable books on classical recursive analysis by Aberth [ 1980 , 2001 ] . )
Fortunately , one can get to the heart of RUSS by an axiomatic approach due to Richman [ 1983 ] ( see also Chapter 3 of Bridges & Richman [ 1987 ] ) .
First , we define a set \ ( S\ ) to be countable if there is a mapping from a detachable subset of \ ( \bN\ ) onto \ ( S\ ) .
With intuitionistic logic we cannot prove that every subset of \ ( \bN\ ) is detachable ( the reader is invited to provide a Brouwerian example to demonstrate this ) .
Countable subsets of \ ( \bN\ ) in Richman ’s axiomatic approach are the counterparts of recursively enumerable sets in the normal development of RUSS .
By a partial function on \ ( \bN\ ) we mean a mapping whose domain is a subset of \ ( \bN\ ) ; if the domain is \ ( \bN\ ) itself , then we call the function a total partial function on \ ( \bN\ ) .
Richman ’s approach to RUSS is based on intuitionistic logic and a single axiom of computable partial functions ( CPF ) :
There is an enumeration \( \phi_0 , \phi_1 , \ldots\ ) of the set of all partial functions from \ ( \bN\ ) to \ ( \bN\ ) with countable domains .
It is remarkable what can be deduced cleanly and quickly using this principle .
For example , we can prove the following result , which almost immediately shows that LLPO , and hence LPO , are false in the recursive setting .
There is a total partial function \(f : \ bN \times \ bN \rightarrow \ {0 ,1\}\ ) such that for each \ ( m\ ) there exists at most one \ ( n\ ) such that \ ( f ( m , n ) = 1 \ ) ; and
for each total partial function \(f : \ bN \rightarrow \ {0,1\}\ ) , there exist \ ( m , k\ ) in \ ( \bN\ ) such that \ ( f ( m, 2 k + f ( m ) ) = 1 \ ) .
Of more interest , however , are results such as the following within RUSS .
Specker ’s Theorem ( Specker [ 1949 ] ) :
There exists a strictly increasing sequence \ ( ( r_1 , r_2 , \ldots ) \ ) of rational numbers in the closed interval \ ( [ 0,1 ] \ ) such that for each \(x \ in \bR\ ) there exist \ ( N \in \bN\ ) and \( \delta \gt 0\ ) such that \( \abs{x - r_n} \ge \ delta\ ) for all \ ( n \ge N\ ) .
For each \( \varepsilon \gt 0\ ) , there exists a sequence \ ( ( I_1 , I_2 , \ldots ) \ ) , of bounded open intervals in \ ( \bR\ ) such that \[ \begin{align} \tag{i} \bR &\subseteq \ bigcup_{n=1} ^{\infty} I_n , \text { and} \\ \tag{ii} \ sum_{n=1} ^N \abs {I_n} &\lt \varepsilon \ text{ for each } N. \end{align}\ ]
( Such a sequence of intervals is called an \( \varepsilon\ ) - singular cover of \ ( \bR\ ) . )
There exists a pointwise continuous function \ (f : [ 0,1 ] \rightarrow \bR\ ) that is not uniformly continuous .
There exists a positive - valued uniformly continuous function \ (f : [ 0,1 ] \rightarrow \bR\ ) whose infimum is 0 .
From a classical viewpoint , these results fit into place when one realises that words such as “ function ” and “ real number ” should be interpreted as “ recursive function ” and “ recursive real number ” respectively .
Note that the second of the above four recursive theorems is a strong recursive counterexample to the open - cover compactness property of the ( recursive ) real line ; and the fourth is a recursive counterexample to the classical theorem that every uniformly continuous mapping of a compact set into \ ( \bR\ ) attains its infimum .
3.3 Bishop ’s Constructive Mathematics
Progress in all varieties of constructive mathematics was relatively slow throughout the next decade and a half .
What was needed to raise the profile of constructivism in mathematics was a top- ranking classical mathematician to show that a thoroughgoing constructive development of deep analysis was possible without a commitment to Brouwer ’s non-classical principles or to the machinery of recursive function theory .
This need was fulfilled in 1967 , with the appearance of Errett Bishop ’s monograph Foundations of Constructive Analysis [ 1967 ] , the product of an astonishing couple of years in which , working in the informal but rigorous style used by normal analysts , Bishop provided a constructive development of a large part of twentieth - century analysis , including the Stone - Weierstrass Theorem , the Hahn - Banach and separation theorems , the spectral theorem for self - adjoint operators on a Hilbert space , the Lebesgue convergence theorems for abstract integrals , Haar measure and the abstract Fourier transform , ergodic theorems , and the elements of Banach algebra theory .
( See also Bishop & Bridges [ 1985 ] . )
Thus , at a stroke , he gave the lie to the commonly - held view expressed so forcefully by Hilbert :
Taking the principle of excluded middle from the mathematician would be the same , say , as proscribing the telescope to the astronomer or to the boxer the use of his fists .
( Hilbert [ 1928 ] )
Not only did Bishop ’s mathematics BISH have the advantage of readability — if you open Bishop ’s book at any page , what you see is clearly recognisable as analysis , even if , from time to time , his moves in the course of a proof may appear strange to one schooled in the use of the law of excluded middle — but , unlike intuitionistic or recursive mathematics , it admits many different interpretations .
Intuitionistic mathematics , recursive constructive mathematics , and even classical mathematics all provide models of BISH .
In fact , the results and proofs in BISH can be interpreted , with at most minor amendments , in any reasonable model of computable mathematics , such as , for example , Weihrauch ’s Type Two Effectivity Theory ( Weihrauch [ 2000 ] ; Bauer [ 2005 ] ) .
How is this multiple interpretability achieved ?
At least in part by Bishop ’s refusal to pin down his primitive notion of “ algorithm ” or , in his words , “ finite routine ” .
This refusal has led to the criticism that his approach lacks the precision that a logician would normally expect of a foundational system .
However , this criticism can be overcome by looking more closely at what practitioners of BISH actually do when they prove theorems : in practice , they are doing mathematics with intuitionistic logic .
Experience shows that the restriction to intuitionistic logic always forces mathematicians to work in a manner that , at least informally , can be described as algorithmic ; so algorithmic mathematics appears to be equivalent to mathematics that uses only intuitionistic logic .
If that is the case , then we can practice constructive mathematics using intuitionistic logic on any reasonably defined mathematical objects , not just some class of “ constructive objects ” .
This view , more or less , appears to have first been put forward by Richman [ 1990 , 1996 ] .
Taking the logic as the primary characteristic of constructive mathematics , it does not reflect the primacy of mathematics over logic that was part of the belief of Brouwer , Heyting , Markov , Bishop , and other pioneers of constructivism .
On the other hand , it does capture the essence of constructive mathematics in practice .
Thus one might distinguish between the ontological constructivism of Brouwer and others who are led to constructive mathematics through a belief that mathematical objects are mental creations , and the epistemological constructivism of Richman and those who see constructive mathematics as characterised by its methodology , based on the use of intuitionistic logic .
Of course , the former approach to constructivism inevitably leads to the latter ; and the latter is certainly not inconsistent with a Brouwerian ontology .
To do actual mathematics we need more than just intutionistic logic .
For Bishop , the building blocks of mathematics were the positive integers ( see the quote from Bishop [ 1967 ] in Section 3.1 above ) .
Among the early formal systems for BISH were Myhill ’s [ 1975 ] axiomatic foundation based on primitive notions of number , set , and function ; Feferman ’s [ 1975 ] system for explicit mathematics ; and Friedman ’s [ 1977 ] intuitionistic ZF set theory .
The two most favoured formal underpinnings of BISH at this stage are the CZF set theory of Aczel and Rathjen [ 2000 ] , and the intuitionistic type theory of Martin - Löf [ 1975 , 1984 ] .
3.4 Martin - Löf ’s Constructive Type Theory
Before ending our tour of varieties of modern constructive mathematics , we visit a fourth variety , based on Per Martin - Löf ’s intuitionistic type theory ( ML ) .
Martin - Löf published his Notes on Constructive Mathematics [ 1968 ] , based on lectures he had given in Europe in 1966 – 68 ; so his involvement with constructivism in mathematics goes back at least to the period of Bishop ’s writing of Foundations of Constructive Analysis .
Martin - Löf ’s book is in the spirit of RUSS , rather than BISH ; indeed , its author did not have access to Bishop ’s book until his own manuscript was finished .
Martin - Löf later turned his attention to his theory of types as a foundation for Bishop - style constructive mathematics .
Here , in his own words , is an informal explanation of the ideas underlying ML :
We shall think of mathematical objects or constructions .
Every mathematical object is of a certain kind or type [… and ] is always given together with its type . …
A type is defined by describing what we have to do in order to construct an object of that type .
…
Put differently , a type is well - defined if we understand … what it means to be an object of that type .
Thus , for instance \( \bN \rightarrow \bN\ ) [ functions from \ ( \bN\ ) to \ ( \bN\ ) ] is a type , not because we know particular number theoretic functions like the primitive recursive ones , but because we think we understand the notion of number theoretic function in general .
( Martin - Löf [ 975 ] )
In particular , in this system every proposition can be represented as a type : namely , the type of proofs of the proposition .
Conversely , each type determines a proposition : namely , the proposition that the type in question is inhabited .
So when we think of a certain type \ ( T\ ) as a proposition , we interpret the formula
\[ x \in T \]
as “ \( x\ ) is a proof of the proposition \ ( T\ ) ” .
Martin - Löf goes on to construct new types , such as Cartesian products and disjoint unions , from old .
For example , the Cartesian product
\[ ( \ Pi x \in A ) B( x ) \]
is the type of functions that take an arbitrary object \ ( x\ ) of type \ ( A\ ) into an object of type \ ( B ( x ) \ ) .
In the propositions - as - proofs interpretation , where \ ( B( x ) \ ) represents a proposition , the above Cartesian product corresponds to the universal proposition
\[ ( \forall x \in A ) B( x ) . \]
Martin - Löf distinguishes carefully between proofs and derivations : a proof object is a witness to the fact that some proposition has been proved ; whereas a derivation is the record of the construction of a proof object .
Also , he exercises two basic forms ( one dare not say “ types ” here ) of judgement .
The first is a relation between proof objects and propositions , the second a property of some propositions .
In the first case , the judgement is either one that a proof object \ ( a\ ) is a witness to a proposition \ ( A\ ) , or else one that two proof objects \ ( a\ ) and \ ( b\ ) are equal and both witness that \ ( A\ ) has been proved .
The first case of the second form of judgement states that a proposition \ ( A\ ) is well - formed , and the second records that two propositions \ ( A\ ) and \ ( B\ ) are equal .
There is a careful , and highly detailed , set of rules for formalising ML .
We will not go into those here , but refer the reader to other sources such as Sambin & Smith [ 1998 ] .
When actually doing constructive mathematics in type theory , one often needs to equip completely presented sets ( types ) with an equivalence relation , the combination being known as a setoid .
Mappings are then functions that respect those equivalence relations .
This is in close agreement with the way Bishop presented his informal theory of sets .
The dependent types of Martin - Löf are useful for constructing subsets .
For instance , the real numbers can be constructed using the \( \Sigma\ ) - type ( see Martin - Löf [ 1984 ] ) :
\[ ( \ Sigma x \in \bN_+\rightarrow \ bQ ) ( \ Pi m \in \bN_ + ) ( \ Pi n \in \bN_+) \left[\abs{x_{m} - x_{n}} \le \left ( \frac{1}{m} + \ frac{1}{n}\right ) \right ] , \]
An element of this type \ ( B\ ) is thereby a pair consisting of a convergent sequence \( \bx\ ) of rationals and a proof \ ( p\ ) that it is convergent .
A suitable equivalence relation \ ( {\sim}\ ) on \ ( R\ ) is defined by taking \ ( ( x , p ) \sim (y , q ) \ ) to mean
\ [ \forall m \in \bN_+ \ left ( \abs{x_{m} - y_{m}} \le \ frac{2}{m}\right ) . \]
The resulting setoid of real numbers is \( \bR = ( R , {\sim} ) \ ) .
We can readily prove that
\ [ \forall x \in \bR\ , \exists n \in Z ( n \lt x \lt n+2 ) \]
and then , using the type - theoretic axiom of choice ( see Section 4 below ) , find a function \(f : \ bR\rightarrow \bZ\ ) such that \ ( f ( x ) \lt x \lt f( x ) + 2 \ ) .
However , there is no reason to believe that the function \ ( f\ ) respects the equivalence relations — that is , that \ ( f ( x ) = f(y ) \ ) holds if \(x \ sim y\ ) .
Every constructive proof embodies an algorithm that , in principle , can be extracted and recast as a computer program ; moreover , the constructive proof is itself a verification that the algorithm is correct — that is , meets its specification .
One major advantage of Martin - Löf ’s formal approach to constructive mathematics is that it greatly facilitates the extraction of programs from proofs .
This has led to serious work on the implementation of constructive mathematics in various locations ( see Martin - Löf [ 1980 ] , Constable [ 1986 ] , Hayashi & Nakano [ 1988 ] , Schwichtenberg [ 2009 ] ) .
Some recent implementations of type theory for proof extraction are Coq and Agda ( see the links in Other Internet Resources ) .
4. The Axiom of Choice
The full axiom of choice can be stated as follows :
If \( A , B\ ) are inhabited sets , and \ ( S\ ) a subset of \( A \times B\ ) such that \[ \ forall x\in A\ , \exists y\in B ( ( x , y ) \ in S ) , \ ] \[ \ forall x\in A\ , \exists y\in B ( ( x , y ) \ in S ) , \ ] then there exists a choice function \(f : A \rightarrow B\ ) such that \[ \ forall x\in A ( ( x , f( x ) ) \ in S ) . \] \[ \ forall x\in A ( ( x , f( x ) ) \in S ) . \]
Now , if this is to hold under a constructive interpretation , then for a given \(x \in A\ ) , the value \ ( f ( x ) \ ) of the choice function will depend not only on \ ( x\ ) but also on the data proving that \ ( x\ ) belongs to \( A.\)
In general , we cannot expect to produce a choice function of this sort .
However , the BHK interpretation of the hypotheses in the axiom is that there is an algorithm \( \mathcal {A}\ ) which , applied to any given \( x \in A\ ) , produces an element \(y \in B\ ) such that \( ( x , y ) \ in S\ ) .
If \( A\ ) is a completely presented set , one for which no work beyond the construction of each element in the set is required to prove that the element does indeed belong to \ ( A\ ) , then we might reasonably expect the algorithm \( \mathcal {A}\ ) to be a choice function .
In Martin - Löf ’s type theory , every set is completely presented and , in keeping with the BHK interpretation , the axiom of choice is derivable .
On the other hand , in Bishop - style mathematics , completely presented –––or , in his terminology , basic–––sets are rare , one example being \ ( \bN\ ) ; so we might expect that the axiom of choice would not be derivable .
In fact , as was shown by Diaconescu [ 1975 ] and Goodman & Myhill [ 1978 ] , and prefigured by Bishop himself in Problem 2 on page 58 of Bishop 1967 , the axiom of choice implies the law of excluded middle .
Clearly , the Diaconescu - Goodman - Myhill theorem applies only under the assumption that not every set is completely presented .
Constructive mathematicians not working in ML typically reject the full axiom of choice but embrace the axiom of countable choice , in which the domain of choice is \ ( \bN\ ) , and dependent choice .
But some prefer to work without even countable choice , on the grounds that to speak of an infinity of choices without giving a rule presents a difficulty that is just as great whether or not the infinity is denumerable .
Interestingly , Lebesgue made precisely this point in a letter to Borel ( see Moore [ 2013 ] , page 316 ) :
I agree completely with Hadamard when he states that to speak of an infinity of choices without giving a rule presents a difficulty that is just as great whether or not the infinity is denumerable .
The effect of abandoning even countable choice is the exclusion of many theorems that , as they stand , are proved using sequential , choice - based arguments .
But those who advocate avoiding choice would argue that avoiding choice forces you to formulate things better .
A particular case of interest is the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra : every complex polynomial has at least one root in the complex plane .
Richman [ 2000 ] has shown that without countable choice , although we can construct only isolated ( possibly multiple ) roots , we can construct arbitrarily close approximations to the multiset of roots .
Such an approach focusses on finding an approximate linear factorization of the polynomial , rather than on finding separate approximations to each of its roots .
For further analysis of the axiom of choice in set theory and type theory see Martin - Löf [ 2006 ] , and the SEP entries on category theory , type theory , and intuitionistic type theory .
5. Constructive Reverse Mathematics
In the 1970s , Harvey Friedman initiated a research programme of reverse mathematics , aiming to classify mathematical theorems according to their equivalence to one of a small number of set - theoretic principles ( Friedman 1975 ) .
This classification reveals interesting , sometimes remarkable , differences in proof - theoretic complexity .
For example , although the Ascoli - Arzelà theorem is used in the standard proof of Peano ’s existence theorem for solutions of ordinary differential equations ( Hurewicz [ 1958 ] , page 10 ) , a reverse - mathematical analysis shows that the former is equivalent to a strictly stronger set - theoretic principle than the one equivalent to Peano ’s theorem ( Simpson [ 1984 ] , Theorems 3.9 and 4.2 ) .
The standard treatise on classical reverse mathematics is ( Simpson [ 1999/2009 ] ) .
Around the turn of this century , Veldman ( see Other Internet Resources ) , in the Netherlands , and Ishihara [ 2005 , 2006 ] , in Japan , independently initiated a programme of constructive reverse mathematics ( CRM ) , based on intuitionistic , rather than classical , logic .
( Note , though , that the first published work in the modern era of CRM is probably that of Julian and Richman [ 1984 ] , which was twenty years ahead of its time . )
In this section of the article , we describe a less formal approach to CRM , in the style and framework of BISH .
The aim of that CRM program is to classify the theorems in the three standard models — CLASS , INT , and RUSS — according to which principles we must , and need only , add to BISH in order to prove them .
We stress that we restrict ourselves here to informal CRM , in which we take for granted the principles of function - and set - construction described in the first chapters of Bishop [ 1967 ] or Bishop & Bridges [ 1985 ] , and we work in the informal , though rigorous , style of the practising analyst , algebraist , topologist , … .
In practice , CRM splits naturally into two parts .
In the first of these , we consider a theorem \ ( T\ ) of INT or RUSS , and try to find some principle , valid in that model and other than \ ( T\ ) itself , whose addition to BISH is necessary and sufficient for a constructive proof of \( T\ ) .
In the second part of CRM we deal with a theorem \ ( T\ ) of CLASS that we suspect is nonconstructive , and we try to prove that \ ( T\ ) is equivalent , over BISH , to one of a number of known essentially - nonconstructive principles , such as MP , LLPO , LPO , or LEM .
For an example of this part of CRM , we mention our earlier proof that the classical least - upper - bound principle implies , and hence is equivalent to , LEM .
Incidentally , there is a strong argument for Brouwer [ 1921 ] being the first to deal with reverse - mathematical ideas : his Brouwerian counterexamples ( see the one using the Goldbach conjecture , in Section 1 above ) lie squarely in the second part of CRM .
Even if Brouwer did not state those examples as logical equivalences , but as implications of the type
\[ P \ Rightarrow \text { some nonconstructive principle} , \]
it is hard to believe that he was unaware that the right - hand - side implied the left in such cases .
5.1 Fan theorems in CRM
To illustrate the first part of CRM , we now concentrate on theorems of the type
\ [ \text {BISH } \vdash \text {
FT}_ ?
\ Leftrightarrow T , \ ]
where FT \( _?\ ) is some form of Brouwer ’s fan theorem , and \( T\ ) is a theorem of INT .
To do so , we need to distinguish between certain types of bar for the complete binary fan \ ( 2 ^ *\ ) ( the set of all finite sequences in \ ( \ { 0,1\} ) \ ) .
Let \( \alpha \equiv ( \alpha_1 , \alpha_2 , \ldots ) \ ) be a finite or infinite binary sequence .
The concatenation of \ ( \alpha\ ) with another string \( \beta\ ) is
\ [ \alpha^{ \frown} \beta \equiv ( \alpha_1 , \alpha_2 , \ldots , \alpha_n , \beta_1 , \ldots , \beta_m ) . \]
For \( b\ ) in \ ( \{ 0,1\}\ ) we write \( \alpha^{ \frown}b\ ) rather than \ ( \alpha^{ \frown} ( b ) \ ) .
By a \ ( \mathsf{c}\ ) - subset of \ ( 2 ^*\ ) we mean a subset \ ( B\ ) of \ ( 2 ^ *\ ) such that
\ [ \tag{1} B = \{u \in 2^* : \ forall v\in 2 ^ * ( u^{\frown}v \in D ) \} \]
for some detachable subset \ ( D\ ) of \ ( 2 ^ *\ ) .
Every detachable subset of \ ( 2 ^*\ ) is a \ ( \mathsf{c} \ ) - subset .
On the other hand , by a \ ( \ Pi^{0}_1 \ ) - subset of \ ( 2 ^ *\ ) we mean a subset \ ( B\ ) of \ ( 2 ^ *\ ) with the following property : there exists a detachable subset \ ( S\ ) of \( 2 ^ * \ times \bN\ ) such that
\ [ \forall u\in 2 ^*\ , \forall n\in \bN\ , ( ( u , n ) \in S \ Rightarrow ( u^{\frown}0 , n ) \in S \wedge ( u^{\frown}1 , n ) \ in S ) \]
and
\[ B = \{u \in 2 ^* :\ forall n\in \ bN ( ( u , n ) \ in S ) \}. \]
Every \( \mathsf{c}\ ) - subset \ ( B\ ) of \ ( 2 ^ *\ ) is a \ ( \ Pi^{0}_1 \ ) - subset : simply take \( S = D \times \ bN\ ) , where \( D\ ) is a detachable subset of \ ( 2 ^ *\ ) such that ( 1 ) holds .
If \(?\ ) denotes a property of subsets of \ ( 2 ^*\ ) , then Brouwer ’s fan theorem for \( ?\ ) - bars tells us that every bar with the property \( ?\ ) is a uniform bar .
We are particularly interested in the fan theorem for detachable bars ( already discussed in Section 3.1 ) :
FT \( _D\ ) : Every detachable bar of the complete binary fan is uniform ;
the fan theorem for \( \mathsf{c}\ ) - bars ( that is , bars that are \( \mathsf{c}\ ) - subsets ) :
FT \( _{\mathsf{c}}\ ) :
Every c-bar of the complete binary fan is uniform ;
the fan theorem for \( \ Pi^{0}_1 \ ) - bars ( that is , bars that are \( \ Pi^{0}_1\ ) - subsets ) :
FT \( _{ \Pi^{0}_1}\ ) : Every \( \Pi^{0}_1\ ) - bar of the complete binary fan is uniform ;
and the full fan theorem :
FT : Every bar of the complete binary fan is uniform .
Note that , relative to BISH ,
FT \( \ Rightarrow\ ) FT \( _{ \Pi^{0}_1} \ Rightarrow\ ) FT \( _c \ Rightarrow\ ) FT \( _D\ ) .
Lubarsky and Diener [ 2014 ] have shown that these implications are strict .
Typically , we want to prove that FT \ ( _?\ ) is equivalent , over BISH , to the proposition that , for every set \ ( S\ ) of an appropriate sort , some pointwise property of the form
\ [ \tag {2} \ forall x \in S \exists t \ in T P(s , t ) \]
actually holds uniformly in the form
\ [ \tag{3} \exists t \in T \ forall s \in S P(s , t ) . \]
Our strategy for attacking this problem is two - fold .
First , given a set \ ( S\ ) of the appropriate sort , we construct a ?- subset \ ( N\ ) of \ ( 2 ^ *\ ) such that
if ( 2 ) holds , then \ ( B\ ) is a bar , and
if \( B\ ) is a uniform bar , then ( 3 ) holds .
This , though , is only half of the solution .
To prove that the implication from ( 3 ) to ( 2 ) implies FT \( _?\ ) , we consider a ?- subset \ ( B\ ) of \ ( 2 ^ *\ ) and construct a corresponding set \ ( S\ ) such that
if \( B\ ) is a bar , then ( 2 ) holds , and
if ( 3 ) holds , then \ ( B\ ) is a uniform bar .
The canonical example of such results is that of Julian and Richman [ 1984 ] , in which \ ( S\ ) is the set of values of a given uniformly continuous mapping \(f : [ 0,1 ] \rightarrow \ bR , T\ ) is the set of positive real numbers , and
\[ P( s , t ) \equiv ( s \ge t ) . \]
The pointwise property we consider is
\ [ \forall x \in [ 0,1 ] \exists t \gt 0 ( f ( x ) \ge t ) , \ ]
its uniform version being
\ [ \exists t \gt 0 \ forall x \in [ 0,1 ] ( f( x ) \ge t ) . \]
The Julian - Richman results are as follows .
Theorem 1 : Let \(f : [ 0,1 ] \rightarrow \bR\ ) be uniformly continuous .
Then there exists a detachable subset \ ( B\ ) of \ ( 2 ^ *\ ) such that if \ ( f ( x ) \gt 0\ ) for each \(x \in [ 0,1 ] \ ) , then \ ( B\ ) is a bar , and
if \( B\ ) is a uniform bar , then \( \inf f \gt 0\ ) .
Theorem 2 : Let \ ( B\ ) be a detachable subset of \ ( 2 ^ *\ ) .
Then there exists a uniformly continuous \ (f : [ 0,1 ] \rightarrow \bR\ ) such that if \ ( B\ ) is a bar , then \( f ( x ) \gt 0\ ) for each \(x \in [ 0,1 ] \ ) , and
if inf \ (f \gt 0\ ) , then \ ( B\ ) is a uniform bar .
The proofs of these two theorems are subtle and tricky ; see Julian & Richman [ 1984 ] .
The two Julian - Richman theorems together reveal that , relative to BISH , the fan theorem FT \( _D\ ) is equivalent to the positivity principle , POS :
Each positive - valued , uniformly continuous function on \ ( [ 0,1 ] \ ) has a positive infimum .
It follows that POS is derivable in INT , in which the full fan theorem , not just FT \( _D\ ) , is a standard principle .
The situation is quiet the opposite in RUSS , where there exist both a detachable bar of \ ( 2 ^ *\ ) that is not uniform and a positive - valued , uniformly continuous function on \ ( [ 0,1 ] \ ) that has infimum equal to 0 ; see Chapters 5 and 6 of Bridges & Richman [ 1987 ] .
Berger and Ishihara [ 2005 ] have taken a different , indirect route to establishing the equivalence of POS and FT \ ( _c\ ) .
They establish a chain of equivalences between POS , FT \( _c\ ) , and four principles of the type “ if there is at most one object with property \ ( P\ ) , then there is one such object ” .
The four unique - existence principles are :
CIN !:
Each descending sequence of inhabited closed located subsets of a compact metric space with at most one common point has inhabited intersection ( Cantor ’s intersection theorem with uniqueness . )
Note that a subset \ ( S\ ) of a metric space \ ( ( X , \rho ) \ ) is located if for each \ ( x\ ) in \ ( X\ ) the infimum distance from \ ( x\ ) to \ ( S\ ) exists .
MIN !:
Each uniformly continuous , real - valued function on a compact metric space with at most one minimum point has a minimum point .
WKL !
Each infinite tree with at most one infinite branch has an infinite branch ( the weak König lemma with uniqueness ) .
FIX !:
Each uniformly continuous function from a compact metric space into itself with at most one fixed point and with approximate fixed points has a fixed point .
In , for example , the last of these , we say that a map \ ( f\ ) of a metric space \ ( ( X , \varrho ) \ ) into itself
has at most one fixed point if \ ( \varrh o ( f ( x ) , x ) + \ varrho ( f ( y ) , y ) \gt 0\ ) whenever \ ( \varrho ( x , y ) \gt 0 \ ) ;
has approximate fixed points if for each \( \varepsilon \gt 0\ ) there exists \(x \ in X\ ) such that \ ( \varrho ( f ( x ) , x ) \lt \varepsilon\ ) .
A major open problem in CRM is that of finding a form of the fan theorem that is equivalent , over BISH , to the uniform continuity theorem for \ ( [ 0,1 ] \ ) ,
UCT \( _{ [ 0,1 ] }\ ) :
Every pointwise continuous mapping of \ ( [ 0,1 ] \ ) into \ ( \bR\ ) is uniformly continuous ,
the proposition for which Brouwer originally developed his proof of the fan theorem .
( Note that UCT \( _{ [ 0,1 ] }\ ) is equivalent , relative to BISH , to the general uniform continuity theorem for metric spaces :
Every pointwise continuous mapping of a complete , totally bounded metric space into a metric space is uniformly continuous .
See , for example , Loeb [ 2005 ] . )
It follows from results of Berger [ 2006 ] that
BISH \( \vdash\ ) UCT \( _{ [ 0,1] } \Rightarrow\ ) FT \( _c\ ) .
Also , Diener and Loeb ( 2008 ) have proved that
BISH \( \vdash\ ) FT \( _{ \Pi^{0}_1} \ Rightarrow\ ) UCT \( _{ [ 0,1 ]}\ ) .
However , we do not know if either of these implications can be replaced by a bi-implication .
Perhaps UCT \( _{ [ 0,1 ] }\ ) , and hence the full uniform continuity theorem for compact metric spaces , is equivalent , relative to BISH , to some natural , but as yet unidentified , version of the fan theorem .
For additional material on the fan theorem in constructive reverse mathematics , see , for example , Berger & Bridges [ 2007 ] ; Diener [ 2008 , 2012 ] ; Diener & Loeb [ 2009 ] ; and Diener & Lubarsky [ 2014 ] .
In Dent [ 2013 ] , there is a clear , though complex , diagram illustrating the interconnections between fan theorems , continuity , and omniscience principles ( see Other Internet Resources ) .

6. Constructive Algebra and Topology
Constructive mathematicians have tended to concentrate their efforts on the field of analysis , with considerable success — witness the wealth of functional analysis developed in Bishop [ 1967 ] .
This does not mean that , for example , algebra has been sidelined from the constructive enterprise : the material in the monograph by Mines et al [ 1986 ] can be regarded as a substantial algebraic counterpart to the constructive analysis carried out by Bishop .
Much more recently , Lombardi and Quitté [ 2011 ] have published the first large volume of a proposed two - volume work on constructive algebra .
However , not being expert in algebra , and being aware of the danger of making this article too long to hold the reader ’s attention , we choose not to discuss constructive analysis or algebra in any detail ; rather , in the following supplementary document , we turn to constructive topology , describing some rather different approaches to that subject :
7. Constructive Mathematical Economics and Finance
Investigations in constructive mathematical economics date back to a series of papers on preference , utility , and demand from 1982 onwards ; see Bridges [ 1999 ] .
In his doctoral thesis , Hendtlass [ 2013 ] substantially weakened the conditions for the existence of a demand function ; he also produced a wealth of results in fixed - point theory and its applications , in particular to constructivisations of two classical proofs of the existence of an economic equilibrium .
In 2015 , Berger and Svindland began a research project on constructive mathematical finance , at Ludwig - Maximilians - Universität in Munich .
They first showed that the fundamental theorem on asset pricing , the separating hyperplane theorem , and Markov ’s Principle are constructively equivalent ( Berger & Svindland [ 2016 ] ) .
Their more recent work has concentrated on how to circumvent the nonconstructivity of the classical extreme value theorem in order to prove the existence of extreme points for functions in the presence of even relatively weak convexity properties ( Berger & Svindland [ 2016a ] ) .
Their project suggests that mathematical finance , like mathematical economics , may be a rich source of elegant , practical constructive theorems .
8. Concluding Remarks
The traditional route taken by mathematicians wanting to analyse the constructive content of mathematics is the one that follows classical logic ; in order to avoid decisions , such as whether or not a real number equals 0 , that cannot be made by a real computer , the mathematician then has to keep within strict algorithmic boundaries such as those formed by recursive function theory .
In contrast , the route taken by the constructive mathematician follows intuitionistic logic , which automatically takes care of computationally inadmissible decisions .
This logic ( together with an appropriate set - or type - theoretic framework ) suffices to keep the mathematics within constructive boundaries .
Thus the mathematician is free to work in the natural style of an analyst , algebraist ( e.g. , Mines et al. [ 1988 ] ) , geometer , topologist ( e.g. , Bridges & Vîță [ 2011 ] , Sambin forthcoming ) , or other normal mathematician , the only constraints being those imposed by intuitionistic logic .
As Bishop and others have shown , the traditional belief promulgated by Hilbert and still widely held today , that intuitionistic logic imposes such restrictions as to render the development of serious mathematics impossible , is patently false : large parts of deep modern mathematics can be , and have been , produced by purely constructive methods .
Moreover , the link between constructive mathematics and programming holds great promise for the future implementation and development of abstract mathematics on the computer .

SAN ANTONIO
Channeling her inner Cheney , Hillary Clinton dropped a fear bomb , as Michelle Obama might call it , implying in a new ad that if her opponent is elected , your angelic , innocent , sleeping children could die in a terrorist attack .
Only she has the wise head to go nuclear , should that Strangelovian phone call from a power - mad Putin come into the White House at 3 a.m .
Her ad shows how composed she would be at the dread moment when she picks up the phone .
Her nuke look is feminine , in a tailored camel - colored jacket and gold necklace , yet serious , in Tina Fey black reading glasses .
It ’s hard to discern the message of the ad .
The scariest thing is not the persistently ringing phone but an Andrea Yates - looking mother who ’s creeping up on the sleeping babes in the dark .
The point ca n’t be that Hillary is superior to Obama in international crisis management , because she ’s done no more of it than he has .
She ’s only done domestic crisis management , cleaning up after Frisky Bill .
Is the message that Hillary is Ready on Night One ?
That she wo n’t have to waste any time if she ’s rousted out of bed in the wee hours , because she ’s wearing a pantsuit under her pantsuit ?
( Or is it just , as Wesley Clark said during an appearance with her in Waco on Friday , that Hillary ’s “ been in the White House when the tough decisions were made .
I guess you ’ve been at the bedside when that phone rang at 3 a.m . ” )

Luke 's reef : Reared larvae will come here once they are ready to settle
The coral reefs in the tropical western Pacific are at the brink of one of the most spectacular and significant nights in their annual life cycle .
By the light of April 's full moon on Sunday or , quite likely a night or two after , corals will be mating en masse .
Along the length of the island archipelago that makes up the Republic of Palau , millions of coral colonies will simultaneously release billion upon billion of eggs and sperm into the dark waters .
An hour or so after sunset , each spawning coral will discharge showers of sex cells , packaged in orange and pink blobs .
They will rise to the surface in such huge numbers that they may form oily slicks metres long .
If the sea conditions are right , spawn slicks can coalesce to be large enough to be visible from space .
Depressing need
Once on the surface , the packages burst open , liberating eggs and sperm for fertilisation .
Countless free - swimming coral larvae then develop and three or four days later , a few will have survived long enough to make it to the sea bed .
There they attach to a suitable hard surface and develop into single baby coral polyps .
The next generation of corals on the reefs will be launched .
A team of marine biologists from Australia , Britain and the Philippines has come to Palau to take advantage of this wonder of nature in the cause of coral reef restoration .
The scientists are here to investigate the potential of an experimental technique known as coral seeding - in other words , collecting some of the spawn from mass mating events and using it to promote the growth of new corals on reefs in need of rescue .
The reefs around Palau are in good shape but elsewhere throughout the tropical world , many coral ecosystems are in a parlous state .
Plenty spare Pollution , over - fishing and coral bleaching events , which are caused by marine heat waves , have reduced the amount of coral to the point where these naturally bio - diverse habitats are at varying degrees of degradation .
Many are nearing ecological collapse - some have gone forever , already .
Acropora is an important reef - builder and is common here However , many reefs might be salvageable if they are first protected from pollution and overexploitation , and then are seeded with some surplus spawn from more vibrant reefs .
Most of the eggs and larvae from a mass spawning event are eaten or die before they get an anchor hold on the sea bed , so there is plenty of spawn to share around .
In the coming experiment on Palau , the scientists will not be using coral spawn produced on the open reefs .
Partly for practical reasons , they will harvest their spawn under more controllable conditions at the laboratory of the Palau International Coral Reef Center .
In the lab On Saturday , I joined them on a trip to collect 10 dinner - plate - sized coral colonies from Luke 's reef about 20 minutes speed - boat - ride from the Reef Center .
James Guest , from the University of Newcastle , UK , and Maria Vanessa Baria from the University of the Philippines dived to the sea bed , armed with hammers and chisels .
They were after a particular species of branching coral which forms large tables or shelves as it grows .
It is this type which is one of the most abundant and most important reef builders .
It takes a few taps at the stony stalk base of each colony to break them free .
Waiting on the boat to receive the corals was Andrew Heyward of the Australian Institute for Marine Science - one of the first biologists to describe the phenomenon of coral mass spawning in the 1980s .
The colonies were put straight into tubs of sea water , and once the tenth was on board , we headed back at a high rate of knots to the Reef Center .
Back at the Center , the coral were transferred with speed to larger tanks , filled with constantly refreshed seawater .
Setting up home
Now there 's a lull before the spawn .
The main event could happen Sunday or Monday or Tuesday night ( Palau time ) .
And some species will synchronously spawn the day after others .
When the captive corals in the lab release their eggs and sperm , the contained spawn will be transferred to children 's paddling pools floating in the sea next to the lab .
The spawning for these corals will occur in laboratory tanks
Over the following few days , the researchers will check the developing larvae to see how many are mature enough to settle down and become fixed baby coral polyps .
When sufficient numbers are good to go , the team will take the batch of larvae back to the reef and pump them over areas of potential colonisation .
The new homes for the larvae are artificial reef balls placed there specially for the purpose .
They are domes of limestone concrete about a one metre wide and high .
Before the larva can be introduced , the reef balls will have to be covered so the larvae do n't just float away .
Big question
So the team will dive the five metres to the sea bed and erect two - man camping tents made of fine mesh over each artificial reef structure .
The baby corals will travel from the boat through the zipped door of the tent via a hose pipe .
Andrew Heyward says the aim of this experiment is to be " low tech or no tech " .
He feels this approach is vital if the technique of coral seeding is ever to be used on any scale in developing countries .
The approach has to be low - tech to succeed , the scientists believe Twenty - four - hours later , the team will check to see how many of their " seeds " have settled by removing small tiles they 've placed on the reef balls .
They will do that again in a few months and after a year .
Each time they will compare the number of young corals with those on tiles from control balls which would have been settled by larvae born in the mass spawning on the reef .
Andrew Heyward points out that loading the dice in the larvae 's favour before they settle is only part of the issue over whether coral seeding will work to restore reefs .
" If you boost the number of larval corals settling on a coral reef , so what ?
Does it make any difference to the longer term compared to an area where you did nothing ? "
The answer will emerge in the next 12 months following this week 's frenzy of mass reproduction on the reefs of Palau .

What are these ?
In a session at the Gartner Emerging Trends conference today , analysts Neil MacDonald and Michael Silver identified many reasons that Windows ( and thus Microsoft ) are in trouble .

Should Microsoft Throw Away Vista ?
Getting Ready for Windows Vista Deployment
Microsoft 's operating system ( OS ) development times are too long and they deliver limited innovation ; their OSs provide an inconsistent experience between platforms , with significant compatibility issues ; and other vendors are out - innovating Microsoft .
That gives enterprises unpredictable releases with limited value , management costs that are too high , and new releases that break too many apps and take too long to test and adopt .
With end users bringing their own software solutions into the office ... well , it 's just a heck of a sad story for Microsoft .
Those arguments probably do n't surprise you .
( See Should Microsoft Throw Away Vista ? and Vista Never Had Its Moment in 2007 . )
But the Gartner analysts offered several more points to show how Windows is in a whole new world of hurt .
High on the list is Windows ' complexity , its lack of modularity , its hardware footprint ( particularly on low - end PCs ) and the increasing movement to Web - based and other OS - agnostic applications .
A few of their arguments :
Mature markets have limited growth in terms of PC hardware .
The computer hardware business is expected to grow only 2 percent to 8 percent between 2005 and 2011 .
The opportunities for PCs are higher in emerging markets , where the growth rate is 16 percent to 24 percent for PC hardware — but they 're more price - sensitive so vendors and enterprises have to keep the price down .
That means less memory and storage , for example — and Vista is not appropriate for that sort of memory model .
Linux is the preferred OS on low - end PCs including " one laptop per child " and certainly Microsoft does n't want to see that happen .
" All these things are in opposition to what we 've seen with people expanding PC use year after year , " MacDonald said .
Version compatibility is relevant in more than software development terms .
For example , they said , iPhone 's version of OS X is closer to the desktop version of the Mac OS than Windows Mobile is to Vista .
Servers are evolving in multiple and sometimes conflicting directions .
Some industry trends imply that we need to scale up computing , such as single instance data stores and partitioning .
Others are driving it down , such as grid and cloud computing , server farms and cluster computing .
The result , they believe , is that enterprises will want to customize the OS based on the need .
Microsoft has taken some first steps in this regard , they pointed out ; for example , Windows Server 2008 can be preconfigured based on roles .
" That 's a step in the right direction , but it 's still fairly superficial , " said Silver .
What 's needed is a radical change in architecture that goes beyond packaging DLLs , he added .
The move to server - agnostic applications is still in its infancy but will soon have a major effect on enterprise computing .
The legacy applications wo n't go away , even if the exciting stuff is being done on Internet - based apps , they said .
But it wo n't stay that way .
Today , 70 percent to 80 percent of corporate applications require Windows to run , but the Gartner analysts expect a tipping point in 2011 , when the majority of these applications will be OS - agnostic , such as Web applications .
" Sometime in the middle of the next decade , Windows will be playing a much less important role on the desktop , " MacDonald said .
Virtualization changes our view of what operating systems are .
Virtualization starts offering levels of abstraction between the OS and the hardware , pointed out the analysts .
The hypervisor is taking on some of the role of what the OS did .
" Is this the time to redraw some of these lines ? " asked Silver .
" For us in IT , the interjection of these new layers helps introduce fluidity , and lets us better manage IT . "
And Yet , Gartner Says : Do n’t Skip Vista
All of these points do n’t necessarily mean that your enterprise should skip Windows Vista entirely .
Although half the Gartner clients they surveyed do n't plan to begin Vista migration until the second half of 2008 ( the same clients who represent 2.5 million PCs and , in 2006 , confidently said they 'd get going with Vista in the second half of 2007 or the beginning of 2008 ) .
" We do n't recommend skipping Vista , " said MacDonald .
They do , however , suggest that enterprises adopt Vista by attrition ( such as when buying new computers that have it preloaded ) .
That 's not because of Vista 's virtues but , said MacDonald , because Windows 7 is scheduled to be released in 2009 or 2010 , and you do n't want to wait until 2012 for deployment .
The analysts recommended that in the short term , enterprises assess the range of Windows OS types and instances in their infrastructure and determine their company 's own tipping point for OS - agnostic applications .
In the next year , they said , IT managers should evaluate where various virtualization technologies and OS - agnostic apps can provide early advantages .
Should you consider other operating systems ?
( It 's not an unusual idea . )
MacDonald and Silver believe you should at least calculate the cost of switching to another environment .
Microsoft wo n't change its message unless enterprises make it clear they 'll adopt technologies and strategies that serve its users best , they said .
Do proceed with Windows Vista deployments as you 've planned , though , as the earliest Microsoft could deliver against the analysts ' vision ( if they wanted to ) would be 2010 .
What does Microsoft think of all this ?
MacDonald and Silver said they 've talked with Steve Ballmer about their analysis , but 95 % of Microsoft revenue comes from OEM shipments .
Ballmer " has billions at risk , " Silver said .
" I believe Microsoft will pursue a path of slow , incremental change because that 's safest for their stockholders — unless you vote with your dollars . "
Research from ancient sediment cores indicates that a warming climate could make the world 's arctic tundra far more susceptible to fires than previously thought .
The findings are important given the potential for tundra fires to release organic carbon -- which could add significantly to the amount of greenhouse gases already blamed for global warming .
Montana State University post - doctoral researcher Philip Higuera is the lead author on the paper , which summarizes a portion of a four - year study funded by the National Science Foundation .
Higuera and his co-authors examined ancient sediments from four lakes in a remote region of Alaska in and around Gates of the Arctic National Park to determine what kind of vegetation existed in the area after the last ice age , 14,000 to 9,000 years ago .
By looking at fossilized pollen grains in the sediment cores , Higuera and his co-authors determined that after the last ice age , the arctic tundra was very different from what it is now .
Instead of being covered with grasses , herbs , and short shrubs , it was covered with vast expanses of tall birch shrubs .
Charcoal preserved in the sediment cores also showed evidence that those shrub expanses burned -- frequently .
" This was a surprise , " Higuera said .
" Modern tundra burns so infrequently that we do n't really have a good idea of how often tundra can burn .
Best estimates for the most flammable tundra regions are that it burns once every 250 - plus years . "
The ancient sediment cores showed the shrub tundra burned as frequently as modern boreal forests in Alaska -- every 140 years on average , but with some fires spaced only 30 years apart .
advertisement
Higuera 's research is important because other evidence indicates that as the climate has warmed in the past 50 to 100 years , shrubs have expanded across the world 's tundra regions .
" There is evidence of increasing shrub biomass in modern tundra ecosystems , and we expect temperatures to continue to increase and overall moisture levels to decrease .
Combine these two factors and it suggests a greater potential for fires , " Higuera said .
" The sediment cores indicate that it 's happened before . "
The world 's high latitude tundra and boreal forest ecosystems contain roughly 30 percent of the planet 's total soil carbon .
Currently , much of the carbon is locked in permafrost .
But a warming climate could cause the permafrost to melt and release its carbon stores into the atmosphere where it would contribute to the greenhouse effect .
" Vegetation change through an increase in shrub biomass and more frequent burning will change a great deal of the carbon cycle in these high latitudes , " Higuera said .
" We do n't fully understand the implications , except that it 's reasonable to expect that carbon that was previously locked up could enter the atmosphere . "
The paper is the first in a series Higuera expects to publish from his field work .
Future papers will examine how climate , vegetation , and fire regimes have interacted over the past 15,000 years in the region .
Higuera was assisted in his research by MSU undergraduate Alison Kennedy , who graduated in from Earth Sciences in 2007 and co-authors Linda Brubaker and Patricia Anderson from the University of Washington , Thomas Brown from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory , and Feng Sheng Hu from the University of Illinois .

Americans cannot avoid the soaring price of oil .
They pay for it at the pump , with gasoline at a record $ 3.42 a gallon .
They get hit by fuel surcharges when they book airline flights .
Higher fuel prices are a major reason for rocketing food prices – in part , because corn is being diverted from the food supply to make ethanol , in part because of higher fuel costs to produce and transport food .
Now , rising energy prices – oil hit records above $ 115 a barrel this week – are causing concern about the potential damage to the economy .
Americans are spending a larger share of their income on energy than at any time since 1986 .
That has crimped pocketbooks and helped dampen consumer sentiment .
Purchases of everything from cars to clothing are falling .
" We are all worth less and earning less than a year ago , " says economist Mark Zandi of Moody's Economy.com .
" That is why consumers are pulling back , and judging from the confidence numbers they are in a panic mode . "
Many energy analysts believe the bad news is just beginning – the price of gasoline is expected to continue rising through Memorial Day .
Since the beginning of April , the price of gasoline has risen by 13 cents per gallon , according to AAA , a drivers ' organization in Heathrow , Fla .
AAA is predicting gasoline prices on a national basis will hit $ 3.50 a gallon by Memorial Day .
" It 's well within the range of possibilities , but we think $ 4 a gallon is still premature , " says Geoff Sundstrom , a spokesman .
One indicator of the effect of the steady rise in oil prices came on Wednesday when the Labor Department reported that the March consumer price index , a measure of the rate of inflation , rose by 0.3 percent – or close to a 4 percent annual rate after no change in February .
Energy prices alone rose 1.9 percent in March , with gasoline climbing 1.3 percent .
If it were not for a large drop in clothing prices – due to retailers trying to unload inventory – the overall inflation rise would have been much higher .
If you did n't eat and did n't drive , the inflation rate was only 0.2 percent , barely within the Federal Reserve 's comfort level .
In the past three months , average consumer spending on energy came to $ 663 billion , or 6.5 percent of total consumer spending , according to Moody's Economy.com .
A year ago , it represented 5.8 percent and in 2002 , it was 4.1 percent of their spending .
" If gasoline breaks through $ 4 a gallon by Memorial Day , that would mean spending on gasoline would have risen by $ 100 billion since the beginning of the year , or roughly the size of the tax rebate checks going out , " says Mr. Zandi .
" The rebate checks are going to pay for filling up our tank . "
Energy prices , particularly at the pump , are now part of the presidential campaign .
On Tuesday , Sen. John McCain ( R ) of Arizona , as part of a broad economic plan , proposed removing the federal tax on fuels , 18.4 cents a gallon for gasoline and 24.4 cents on diesel from Memorial Day to Labor Day .
" The effect will be an immediate economic stimulus – taking a few dollars off the price of a tank of gas every time a family , a farmer , or trucker stops to fill up , " said Senator McCain said in his speech at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh .
Opponents of the proposal quickly pointed out that the tax goes to fund highway and transit programs .
Without the tax , the government would lose $ 9 billion in revenue .
" We have looked at it in terms of jobs and estimate 312,000 jobs would be in jeopardy , so it 's a little puzzling for us why you would do something to depress a major sector of the economy – construction , " says Matt Jeanneret , a spokesman for the American Road & Transportation Builders Association in Washington .
The construction industry is also feeling the pinch of rising energy prices , says Ken Simonson , chief economist for the Associated General Contractors of America in Arlington , Va .
" It 's brutal , " he says .
" Contractors use a great deal of fuel ... for digging equipment and moving earth and now they are paying whopping fuel surcharges . "
On Tuesday , a government report showed how energy prices are eating into the corporate bottom line .
The March producer price index ( PPI ) , a measure of changes in wholesale prices , rose 1.1 percent over the prior month .
So far this year , the PPI is up 6.9 percent .
" This is really going very badly for retailers , " says Scott Krugman of the National Retail Federation in Washington .
" Basically , the high gasoline prices are like an extra tax on the industry . "
Mr. Krugman says the federation 's past studies have found consumers react to rising gasoline prices by making small sacrifices .
" We have found the first way they cut back is by eating out less , " he says .
That would be the case for Nancy Owens in Rochester , N.Y .
This winter she cut off her cable TV to pay for heat .
Ms. Owens , a former hospital worker now on disability , only goes to restaurants for special occasions .
" It really cuts off your social life , " she says , " but right now , I only use the car for groceries and doctors ' appointments . "
The government yesterday released details of its £ 170 m plan to train 3,600 more psychological therapists in the wake of a study showing that antidepressant drugs such as Prozac are no more effective than a placebo .
About 900,000 more people will be treated for depression and anxiety under the plan , according to the Department of Health , which predicts that 450,000 of them will be completely cured .
The department also believes that 25,000 fewer people will claim sick pay and benefits because of mental health problems .
" The Improving Access to Psychological Therapies programme has already captured the imagination of primary care trusts up and down the country and is transforming the lives of thousands of people with depression and anxiety disorders in the areas that have been involved so far , " said Alan Johnson , the health secretary .
A study published in the open access journal PLoS ( Public Library of Science ) Medicine on Tuesday revealed that Prozac , Seroxat and other antidepressants of the same class had performed no better than dummy pills in the earliest trials in the 1980s .
No such analysis has been done before because of the reluctance of the pharmaceutical companies to hand over the full trial results .
Professor Irving Kirsch from the department of psychology at Hull University and colleagues in the US and Canada obtained complete data for all the trials submitted to the licensing authority in the United States under freedom of information rules .
When all the data was amalgamated - some of it is unpublished - it became clear that most of the effect of the drugs was a placebo effect .
Mental health groups say doctors have had no choice but to prescribe drugs because of the shortage of therapists , even though the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence ( Nice ) recommends that talking therapies should be tried before drugs are prescribed .
" Nine out of 10 GPs say they 've been forced to dish out drugs because they do n't have proper access to ' talking treatments ' such as cognitive behavioural therapy , " said Alison Cobb , policy officer at Mind .
In 2006 , more than 31 m prescriptions for antidepressants were written in the UK , the charity says , of which 16.2 m were for SSRIs ( selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ) , which include Prozac and Seroxat .
" The doctors , the patients and campaigners like us have been telling government for years : spend NHS money on talking therapies and do n't just pour it into drugs .
Some people do benefit from anti-depressants , but they want talking therapies too , " said Paul Corry , of Rethink .
Phillip Hodson , a fellow of the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy , said 60 % of GP practices had offered some sort of counselling for several years , but there were time limits and restrictions .
Patients on antidepressants were urged yesterday not to stop taking them without seeing a doctor .
Sheila Hollins , president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists , said : " We must stress that anyone currently taking antidepressants should first contact their own doctor before considering stopping their medication , as is the case with any form of prescribed medication . "
Tim Kendall , joint director of the National Collaborating Centre for Mental Health , which put together the guidelines for Nice , said that if they had been asked to approve Prozac , Seroxat and other antidepressants of that class at the time of licensing , on the basis of the information gathered from the Kirsch study , they would have turned them down because of their ineffectiveness .
Nice is currently reviewing its advice on the drugs .

' These drugs worked for me '
Lisa Tanner is a mother of four from Worcestershire
Shortly after my second daughter was born in 2003 , I developed severe postnatal depression .
I began to worry about the baby dying , started seeing ghosts and developed severe anxiety about leaving the house .
I was really very unwell .
When I saw my GP at six weeks he prescribed a drug , Amytryptaline , that made my symptoms much worse , so shortly afterwards I was given Prozac .
Within four to six weeks everything felt brighter .
I felt like me again .
When I discovered I was pregnant less than a year later I was taken off the drug very abruptly , and I plummeted - the hallucinations started again and I had suicidal tendencies .
I was very , very scared .
After the birth I saw another GP who prescribed Sertraline , another SSRI that is safe to use while breast - feeding .
I felt better within two weeks .
I continued to take it very happily all the way through my fourth pregnancy .
I think there is probably always a placebo effect , but I do n't accept that these drugs do n't work .
Not everyone who has suffered depression is the same , but for me SSRIs have definitely helped .
The GP
' The SSRIs definitely help '
Rob Barnett is a GP from Liverpool
I see a handful of people every week who are either feeling down , or have long - standing anxiety , or have symptoms suggestive of depression .
It is true that there are some patients for whom , if I was able to get them some cognitive behaviour therapy or counselling , that is all that would be needed .
But I have others who I have no doubt require medication , and for whom the SSRIs have definitely been helpful .
I genuinely do not think that the placebo effect can account for everything .
The truth is that counselling is exceptionally difficult to come by on the NHS .
We are still talking of waiting lists that can be up to a year , and it is completely impractical to expect most patients to wait that long .
You learn that banging your head against a brick wall just causes you a headache .
I am very careful to assess my patients with a standardised questionnaire and I would like to think my first port of call is n't always the prescription pad .
It might just mean seeing the patient fairly regularly - that in itself can be therapeutic .
Interviewed by Esther Addley
( CNN ) -- New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson sharply disputed that he made any promises to Bill Clinton about presidential endorsements , as Clinton reportedly has claimed .
" I never did , " Richardson said Wednesday on CNN's " The Situation Room . "
" I never saw [ President Clinton ] five times .
I saw him when he watched the Super Bowl with me .
We made it very clear to him that he should n't expect an endorsement after that meeting . "
Bill Clinton made the remarks in a gathering with some California superdelegates , the San Francisco Chronicle reported .
Clinton became " red- faced " when the subject of Richardson 's endorsement of Sen.
Barack Obama came up and said , " Five times to my face he said that he would never do that , " the newspaper reported .
Shortly after Richardson 's endorsement , former Clinton White House aide and political strategist James Carville , who is also a CNN political analyst , told The New York Times that Richardson 's decision was an " act of betrayal . "
The endorsement " came right around the anniversary of the day when Judas sold out for 30 pieces of silver , so I think the timing is appropriate , if ironic , " Carville said , referring to Easter weekend .
Clinton aides distanced themselves from those remarks , and Richardson said he was n't going to " get in the gutter like that . "
Richardson on Wednesday said he was " very close to endorsing " Sen.
Hillary Clinton , but decided not to after the campaign became negative .
Watch Richardson defend his endorsement »
" I held back .
I waited .
I felt the campaign got nasty .
I heard Sen. Obama ; he would talk to me continuously , " Richardson said .
" The Clintons should get over this , " he said .
Richardson endorsed Obama two weeks ago , saying his " affection for Hillary Clinton and President Bill Clinton will never waver " but that " it is now time for a new generation of leadership . "
Richardson was secretary of energy under the Clinton administration , a post that helped bring him to national prominence and win the governorship of New Mexico in 2002 .
He said he called Clinton to tell her of his decision to endorse Obama and said while it was a " tough conversation , " he thinks he 's been " totally up front . "
Richardson on Wednesday said he has not talked to Bill Clinton since the endorsement .
" He 's probably upset , and I understand that , because this is a tough game .
But we 've got to get over it .
We 've got to get positive .
We 've got to start talking about the issues , " he said .
Richardson said he thinks the party needs to decide on a nominee .
" I 'm not suggesting Sen. Clinton get out of the race .
She 's run a good , strong race , " he said .
" We should finish these primaries .
There are 10 left .
June 3 is the last one .
But shortly thereafter , I think the party superdelegates , party leaders should come together and say ... this gulf between the top two candidates that have run two great races needs to end . "
Former President Jimmy Carter on Wednesday implied that he 's also backing Obama , but did not make an official endorsement .
Speaking with a Nigerian newspaper journalist while in Abuja , Carter cited reasons he might be leaning toward the Illinois senator .
" Do n't forget that Obama won in my state of Georgia , " Carter said .
" My town , which is home to 625 people , is for Obama , my children and their spouses are pro-Obama .
My grandchildren are also pro-Obama . "
" As a superdelegate , I would not disclose who I am rooting for , but I leave you to make that guess , " Carter added .
The Carter Center in Atlanta , Georgia , confirmed to CNN the newspaper quoted Carter accurately .
Responding to the comments , Clinton campaign spokesman Howard Wolfson said Thursday , " Both Sen . Clinton and President Clinton have a great deal of respect for President Carter and have enjoyed their relationship with him over the years , and obviously he is free to make whatever decision he thinks is appropriate with regard to presidential choice . "
Meanwhile , both Clinton and Obama are campaigning hard in Pennsylvania , their next battleground .
There are 158 delegates at stake in the state 's April 22 primary .
The Obama camp on Thursday announced it hauled in more than $ 40 million from more than 442,000 donors in March .
There were more than 218,000 first - time donors , and the average contribution level was $ 96 .
The figure is not official until the campaign submits paperwork with the Federal Election Commission .
Clinton raised $ 20 million dollars in March , Clinton campaign sources tell CNN .
The official deadline for March paperwork to be filed is April 20 .
Wolfson said he expected Clinton 's tax returns to be released soon .
Clinton pledged on March 25 that she would release her returns within a week .

All About Bill Richardson ( Politician ) • Bill Clinton
On March 11 , this documentary was aired on French television ( ARTE – French - German cultural tv channel ) by French journalist and film maker Marie - Monique Robin .
The in - depth film depicts how Monsanto , a gigantic biotech / agriculture corporation based in St. Louis , is destroying plant biodiversity around the world with genetically engineered seeds and , basically , endangering our future as a human race …
I know that statement may seem a bit dramatic and paranoid , but the amount of control this corporation has gained over global food production should be illegal – oh , I forgot , why would the government make laws against itself ?
Monsanto is the government :
Former Monsanto employees currently hold positions in US government agencies such as the Food and Drug Adminstration and Environmental Protection Agency and even the Supreme Court .
These include Clarence Thomas , Michael Taylor , Ann Veneman and Linda Fisher .
Fisher has been back and forth between positions at Monsanto and the EPA .
Also note that Donald Rumsfeld earned $ 12 million from increased stock value when G.D. Searle & Company was sold to Monsanto in 1985 .
If you feel as disgusted as I did after watching this movie do not hesitate to take action :

An Israeli scientist , Dr. Siegal Sadetzki , has found a link between cell phone usage and the development of tumors .
Dr. Sadetzki , a physician , epidemiologist and lecturer at Tel Aviv University , published the results of a study recently in the American Journal of Epidemiology , in which she and her colleagues found that heavy cell phone users were subject to a higher risk of benign and malignant tumors of the salivary gland .
Those who used a cell phone heavily on the side of the head where the tumor developed were found to have an increased risk of about 50 % for developing a tumor of the main salivary gland ( parotid ) , compared to those who did not use cell phones .
The fact that the study was done on an Israeli population is significant .
Says Sadetzki , " Unlike people in other countries , Israelis were quick to adopt cell phone technology and have continued to be exceptionally heavy users .
Therefore , the amount of exposure to radiofrequency radiation found in this study has been higher than in previous cell phone studies .
" This unique population has given us an indication that cell phone use is associated with cancer , " adds Sadetzki , whose study investigated nearly 500 people who had been diagnosed with benign and malignant tumors of the salivary gland .
Controlled Study Reveals Link
The study 's subjects were asked to detail their cell phone use patterns in terms of how frequently they used one , and the average length of calls .
They were compared to a sample of about 1,300 healthy control subjects .
advertisement
The study also found an increased risk of cancer for heavy users who lived in rural areas .
Due to fewer antennas , cell phones in rural areas need to emit more radiation to communicate effectively .
Sadetzki predicts that , over time , the greatest effects will be found in heavy users and children .
While anecdotal evidence has been substantial , the consistency of the results of this study support an association between cell phone use and these tumors .
The risks have been hard to prove , mainly due to the long latency period involved in cancer development , explains Sadetzki .
Keep Calling but Call Smarter
Today it is estimated that more than 90 % percent of the Western world uses cell phones .
As the technology becomes cheaper and more accessible , its usage by a greater number of people , including children , is bound to increase .
advertisement
" While I think this technology is here to stay , " Sadetzki says , " I believe precautions should be taken in order to diminish the exposure and lower the risk for health hazards . "
She recommends that people use hands - free devices at all times , and when talking , hold the phone away from one 's body .
Less frequent calls , shorter in duration , should also have some preventative effect .
While she appreciates the ease of communication that cell phones allow between parents and their children , Sadetzki says that parents need to consider at what age their children start using them .
Parents should be vigilant about their children 's using speakers or hands - free devices , and about limiting the number of calls and amount of time their children spend on the phone .
" Some technology that we use today carries a risk .
The question is not if we use it , but how we use it , " concludes Sadetzki .
Sadetzki's main research on this new study was carried out at the Gertner Institute for Epidemiology and Health Policy Research at the Sheba Medical Center .
Her research is part of the international Interphone Study , which attempts to determine an association between cell phones and several types of brain and parotid gland tumors .
For the past few days , I ’ve been brooding about Ed Bott ’s recent rant about Techmeme being a “ template for a gazillion me - too bloggers who manage to write down a dozen posts each day without ever expressing an ingenious thought ” .
Given Techmeme ’s well - deserved reputation as being the place to quickly discover what ’s happening within the tech world , Bott ’s assessment is blunt , critical , perhaps unfair but not entirely without merit .
He ’s right ; there ’s an awful lot of blog posts offering little or no insight aside from pertaining to another blog .
Instead of adding to the conversation , many of those posts encounter simple noise and bandwagon jumping .
The question that begs to be asked is why does there seem to be so much me - too blogging as against people contributing to different perspectives ?
Here ’s what I think :
1. Writing original thought - provoking blog content may be a challenge .
It takes time , thought and energy .
The matter , however , is that many bloggers are often in need of time , which suggests it ’s difficult to return up with insightful thoughts .
As Louis Gray talked about during a recent post , many bloggers are time - strapped with blogging and being on other social / content vehicles like Twitter , Facebook , FriendFeed , RSS readers , etc .
If you ’re doing all that , when does one have time to think Big Thoughts ?
2 . Many bloggers just want to be a part of the conversation before it moves on .
Here ’s what happens in many cases .
You see a hot story and you ’re keen to leap in but not willing to easily leave a discussion someone else ’s blog .
Solution : Pound out a fast , no - frills post that creates you are feeling good about being on top of the recent story albeit it ’s piling on .
I ’m willing to guess that fifty of the posts a few red - hot stories on Techmeme were posts that just parroted the news reports .
3 . Writing original content often provides a coffee return on investment .
Let ’s face it , traffic is what drives many bloggers , which explains why checking your stats on a daily basis may be a key part of blogging .
Once you write original content that falls outside the recent news of the day , there ’s an honest chance it ’s not getting to get much love or traffic .
How come ?
The most important reason is most are spending such a lot of time reading or writing about the large news of the day , your original , thought - provoking post gets buried .
As a result , it ’s easy to think “ Why to put such a lot of effort into writing quality content when there ’s instant gratification ( and traffic ) by jumping on the bandwagon ” .
4 . Unless your blogging to survive is like Mike Arrington or Erick Schonfeld , or you ’re a tech reporter like Mathew Ingram or a conference junkie like Robert Scoble , you do n’t have steady access to people and new ideas that always spawn original blog posts .
5. Vanity and Envy .
If you actually want to ascertain your name on Techmeme , write on the highest news on Techmeme .
If you would like to speak about whatever TechCrunch is covering , a blog on what Arrington cares about .
As much as writing original , insightful posts are every blogger ’s goal , the truth is it ’s difficult .
Sometimes , the ideas are n’t flowing but you continue to get to feed the blog a day .
Sometimes , jumping into the conversation of the day just feels good .
At an equivalent time , however , writing original content is so much more satisfying because there ’s a way of accomplishment that you ’ve been inspired by something you ’ve read or talked about with someone about .
The things that make blogging so rewarding are those nuggets of original content gold .
Just by coincidence , I stumbled across a blog widget tool called Skribit , which provides how for people that read your blog to form suggestions for brand spanking new posts .
one among the guarantees is it ’ll “ Cure writer ’s block overnight ” .
I just installed it – let ’s see if there ’s any devour .

Homeland Security Checkpoint
I originally created the threat chart as part of our Homeland Security Checkpoint at Burning Man 2006 :
Officer Bob and Officer Roberta
Our team of highly - trained , meticulously - screened officers was placed strategically across the mouth of a major intersection during the more - than - 40,000 - person event .
We intercepted suspicious - looking persons and , using the latest in American security technology , determined if these subjects were with us — or against us :
Officer Bob and Officer Roberta performing a Body Cavity Check
In the image above , we see a subject willingly submitting himself to the Homeland Security Body Cavity Check :
The Body Cavity Check is a minor inconvenience to which we must occasionally place our American citizens .
It 's just a small price to pay for enduring freedom .
At the checkpoint , we would also confiscate any liquids that subjects were attempting to carry through .
Our program also included thorough , random Security Wand scans which — strangely enough — would frequently reveal illegal contraband that the terrorists were hiding in this location :

Recent advances in Total Information Awareness and terrorist psycho-profiling have allowed our Department to greatly reduce inconvenience and waiting time for our loyal citizens .
For example , at our checkpoint , we were able to immediately wave through any low - risk subjects ( e.g. those wearing turbans , those with long scraggly beards , those carrying swords , maces , or other homemade electro - chemical devices ) and focus on the real terrorists .
Here , Chief Officer

Former Stripper & Teachers Aide Abbiejane Swogger : 33 New Underage Sex Charges
, 34 , of Natrona , Pennsylvania was a special - education aide at Highlands Senior High School .
She resigned under pressure in February and was charged at that time with possession of crack cocaine and corruption of minors for an underage party involving high school teenagers at New Kensington ’s Clarion Hotel .
The former teacher 's aide is now charged with stripping for teens and having sex with at least two boys .
The former exotic dancer picked up 33 additional counts this week , including indecent assault and corruption of minors , for incidents in January .
That was weeks before police raided a hotel room party in February .
In court documents , police say a 17 - year - old Harrison boy acknowledged having a sexual relationship with Swogger for several weeks starting in January .
Swogger is also accused of performing a sex act on a 16 - year - old boy at his house about three weeks earlier and stripping for three boys on January 18 .
The teachers aide resigned her job in the wake of the February allegations and hotel raid .
Swogger , unable to post $ 50,000 bail , remains behind bars .
Police in neighboring counties have consolidated the charges against Abbiejane Swogger , 34 , who faces a preliminary hearing May 1 .
Additional photos of Swogger below .
Election of 1828
The Election of 1824 had left supporters of Andrew Jackson bitterly disappointed .
He had garnered the most electoral votes , but had been denied the presidency by the House of Representatives .
The Election of 1828 was unique in that nominations were no longer made by Congressional caucuses , but by conventions and the state legislatures .
John Quincy Adams was re-nominated by forces then calling themselves the National Republicans ; his running mate was Secretary of the Treasury Richard Rush .
The Democratic Republican ( soon to be simply Democratic ) opposition was posed by Jackson and his vice - presidential candidate , John C. Calhoun ( who had previously been vice president under Adams ) .
The campaign was the first true mud-slinging contest .
Adams was accused of misusing public funds — he had supposedly purchased gambling devices for the presidential residence ; actually he had simply bought a chessboard and a pool table .
The charges against Jackson were much more malicious .
He was accused of murder for executing militia deserters and dueling .
In addition , he and his wife were accused of adultery .
Rachel was a divorcee ' ; she and Jackson believed her divorce was finalized before their marriage .
The papers were incomplete , however , and she was publicly branded an adulteress by Jackson 's political opponents .
Mrs. Jackson was humiliated , became ill and died before the inauguration .
Jackson believed these attacks caused his wife 's death and said , " May God Almighty forgive her murderers as I know she forgave them .
I never can . "
The election results were a clear victory for Jackson , but were highly sectional in nature .
The South , West , and the states of Pennsylvania and New York went for Jackson ; New England voted for Adams .
The final tally showed :
Writing Python / C extensions by hand
Writing a ctypes interface is quick but has some overhead .
I 'll compare calling cos through Python 's math library vs. calling it though ctypes bindings to libc .
import math , time , ctypes R = range ( 100000 ) libc = ctypes.CDLL ( " libc.dylib " , ctypes.RTLD_GLOBAL ) libc.cos.argtypes = [ ctypes.c_double ] libc.cos.restype = ctypes.c_double def do_timings ( cos ) : t1 = time . time ( ) for x in R : cos( 0.0 ) return time .
time ( ) - t1 def do_math_cos ( ) : return do_timings ( math.cos ) def do_libc_cos ( ) : return do_timings ( libc.cos ) print " math.cos " , do_math_cos ( ) print " libc.cos " , do_libc_cos ( )
math.cos 0.179316997528 libc.cos 0.487237215042
Drawing a Mandelbrot set
The result isshowing that the overhead of using ctypes is about three times that of calling a normal Python / C extension .
Read the wikipedia article if you do n't know about the Mandelbrot set .
From that article I took the following code , which tests the number of iterations needed for a given initial point to diverge .
The algorithm never finishes for points in the set so when it reaches the maximum iteration limit it returns that count instead .
int iterate_point ( double x0 , double y0 , int max_iterations ) { int iteration = 0 ; double x=x0 , y=y0 , x2=x * x , y2=y*y ; while ( x2+ y2<4 && iteration < max_iterations ) { y = 2*x*y + y0 ; x = x2 - y2 + x0 ; x2 = x*x ; y2 = y*y ; iteration ++ ; } return iteration ; }
This is the sort of calculation that Python is slow at doing .
( Well , except through the Numeric library . )
Rather than rewriting the above in Python and taking the performance hit , I 'll call it through Python extension .
Python 's C APIs are pretty reasonable .
It 's been around for 16 years and some of the history shows through , which makes some things confusing .
For example , the preferred way to initialize a module has changed over time .
( Python is good with backwards compatibility and these changes do n't break existing code . )
The big problems come because the programming is C .
There is no automatic garbage collection so you need to do the reference counting manually .
Getting that correct in the face of error handling is hard , as is getting the order of adding and removing references to an object .
Luckily , this example does n't need any explicit reference counting calls .
It 's pretty straight - forward so I 'll embed some comments in the code and leave it at that .
The following file is named " mandelbrot.c " :

Note
Even as creatures become complex , evolution does n't get any harder .
The findings , published yesterday in Nature , shed doubt on a creationist criticism of evolution : that adaptation must rapidly slow as creatures grow more complicated , making them less able to adapt to changing conditions .
Led by Yale University evolutionary biologist Gunter Wagner , researchers measured the cumulative effects of genetic mutations in mice .
Would tweaking a gene affect many different unrelated traits , thus imposing a " cost of complexity " ?
Or would the genetic ripple be constrained ?
The latter , found the researchers : the effects of mutations were indeed multiple , but largely limited to related characteristics .
The researchers also found no relationship between effect strength and the number of affected traits .
Some scientists have wondered whether these would vary inversely , further slowing the pace of adaptation in complex organisms .
" I think the main broader impact of this work is on the evolution - creationism debate , " wrote Wagner in an email .
" I would say the only intellectually interesting argument that the creationists are using , at least the scientifically more sophisticated ones , is that random mutation can not lead to the evolution of complex organisms .
And there are interesting mathematical arguments that have been made to support that .
But our results show that organisms found a way around that problem by restricting mutational effects on very narrowly confined parts of the organisms . "
Pleiotropic scaling of gene effects and the ' cost of complexity ' [ Nature ]
Image : Detail from a mural by Blu . *
Note : Several months ago , I wrote about a study of Scottish sheep that found a genetic relationship between hair color and reproductive fitness – two seemingly unrelated traits .
Did n't that contradict
Wagner 's findings ? *
Wrote Wagner , " Not really , these surprising pleiotropies have been know ever since Genetics was established as a discipline .
The real question is how frequent are those broad effects among a sample of gene mutations " – and these , he said , are not frequent at all , as shown in both his study and another published recently inEvolution .

HOME renovation would seem to be as exciting a spectacle as , well , watching paint dry .
But as Britain neared the peak of a decade - long housing boom , it became prime - time television as producers rushed to make shows like “ Property Ladder ” .
Those happy days in which acquiring a house seemed a sure bet have now ended and even the boost of a quarter - point rate cut from the Bank of England on April 10th is unlikely to bring them back .
Prices , which had been drifting slowly lower over the winter , have started falling more rapidly and dropped 2.5 % in March , according to Halifax , part of HBOS and the country 's biggest mortgage lender .
The biggest monthly drop since September 1992 prompted widespread concerns in a country that still remembers its previous big bust , which started in late 1989 and from which prices did not fully recover for almost a decade .
Mortgage lenders and Labour politicians ( see article ) have talked down the significance of the drop , arguing correctly that monthly data is volatile and that other indices show a very different picture for the month .
The Nationwide Building Society , another large mortgage lender , thinks that prices fell just 0.6 % in March .
What really matters is the annual rate of growth , which has slowed to 1.1 % , the lowest since 1996 , according to both lenders .
Worryingly , both estimates may already be out of date .
Their data , which show that house prices have fallen about 4 % from their peaks , are based on mortgages that are approved by lenders .
Yet mortgage approvals capture only a portion of purchases — about a quarter of properties bought each year are paid for in cash — and take place only some weeks after a price is agreed .
“ The Halifax is behind where we are in the market , ” says Marc Goldberg of Hamptons , an estate agent .
“ The prices we 're getting now are about 10 % down from the peak last summer . ”
The drop should be set in the context of Britain 's long boom in house prices ; between the first quarters of 1997 and 2007 the price of an average home increased by 215 % according to the Nationwide 's index .
Most homeowners are sitting on large gains , and have enough equity to shield both themselves and their mortgage lenders from quite a severe downturn .
Experian , a credit - scoring firm , reckons that if house prices fell by 20 % , only 78,000 households would have mortgages worth more than their homes , a tiny figure set against the almost 12 m mortgages .
On the other hand , the big increases may mean that prices have much further to fall .
The housing market has , in recent years , sustained much higher valuations than was previously thought possible .
Compared with average earnings , homes are more overvalued than at the peak of the previous boom in the late 1980s ( see chart below ) .
They are also high compared with rents , which undermines the argument that the increase in property prices has been driven by low homebuilding rates .
The International Monetary Fund reckons that Britain 's house prices are almost 30 % higher than can be explained by fundamental factors such as disposable income , interest rates and the size of the working - age population .
A crucial reason is that credit has been artificially cheap in recent years because investors have demanded too little return for the risks they have taken on .
This has driven down the cost of borrowing and made loans available to many who might otherwise not have been able to borrow .
Datamonitor , a research firm , reckons that borrowers with spotty credit records account for about 7 % of outstanding mortgages in Britain , with another 5 - 6 % held by people who did not have to prove what their incomes were .
Another 10 % are held by landlords , compared with less than 1 % a decade ago .
Although this has proved a safe form of lending in recent years , no one knows whether people who have invested in houses may be quicker to sell when markets turn down than those who have bought houses to live in .
Turmoil in credit markets has now pushed up the cost of borrowing and forced many lenders to withdraw from the market .
The most recognisable of these was hapless Northern Rock , but it is by no means the only one .
Almost all lenders specialising in Britain 's subprime market had stopped issuing new loans by the end of 2007 because they were no longer able to fund themselves with money raised in the international financial markets .
The number of different sorts of mortgages available to the riskiest borrowers has slumped from more than 9,500 to about 1,300 since August , says George Buckley , an economist at Deutsche Bank .
This week Abbey National , part of Spain 's Santander banking group , became the final mainstream lender to stop offering mortgages that allowed people to buy homes without deposits .
Lenders have been demanding tougher terms and have been especially harsh on customers whose loans exceed 90 % of the value of their homes .
“ We have reached a rare moment when lenders have pricing power and borrowers have none , ” says a senior executive at one large lender .
The seismic shift taking place in mortgage markets suggests that the fall in house prices may be both deep and prolonged .
Reluctant as mortgage lenders are to talk down the market , even the Halifax and Nationwide expect “ modest ” declines in house prices this year .
But this seems Panglossian , to put it mildly .
One gauge of future house - price expectations is found in the property - derivatives market .
In it investors are betting on prices falling by some 10 % this year and another 4 - 5 % next year , says David Miles , an economist at Morgan Stanley .
That would mean a fall of about 20 % in real terms .
Other forward - looking indicators also point to trouble .
The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors reckons that in February the housing market — judging by the ratio of completed sales to unsold properties — was its weakest since 1996 .
Estate agents are having to work harder .
Charles Peerless , who owns estate agencies near the City and in the West End , areas where prices are holding up relatively well , says each property is being viewed about 12 times before a sale , compared with just four or five viewings a year ago .
The Bank of England 's cut in interest rates is unlikely to help the market that much .
On recent form mortgage lenders are unlikely to pass on much of this week 's rate cut .
More important , once people begin to expect lower prices , it is very difficult to reverse a self - fulfilling downward spiral in the housing market .
About the only hark - back to the go - go years may be found on television : a new season of “ Property Ladder ” started this week .
The conservative group Freedom ’s Watch , headlined by two former senior White House officials , had been expected to be a deep - pocketed juggernaut in this year ’s presidential election , heralded by supporters on the right as an aggressive counterweight to MoveOn.org , George Soros and the like .
But after a splashy debut last summer , in which it spent $ 15 million in a nationwide advertising blitz supporting President Bush ’s troop escalation in Iraq , the group has been mostly quiet , beset by internal problems that have paralyzed it and raised questions about what kind of role , if any , it will actually play this fall .
The group was conspicuously absent this week as Gen. David H. Petraeus , the United States commander in Iraq , returned to Congress to testify .
Moreover , the troubles at Freedom ’s Watch come as some Democratic - aligned groups are seeking to take the offensive , with one group , Progressive Media USA , planning to raise $ 40 million to spend on advertisements and other efforts to undermine Senator John McCain of Arizona , the presumptive Republican nominee .
Independent groups not constrained by the limits placed on campaign contributions to candidates and parties have increasingly become major players in races for federal offices .
Those known as 527s , named for the section in the tax code they fall under , raised more than $ 400 million in the 2004 election cycle alone , according to the Campaign Finance Institute .
Such efforts could be especially beneficial for Mr. McCain , who has badly trailed his Democratic counterparts in fund - raising .
About KeyLemon
Gilles Florey and Yann Rodriguez founded KeyLemon in 2008 in Martigny ( Switzerland ) , a region as renowned for its Alpine skiing and scenic beauty as for its entrepreneurial dynamism .
They founded KeyLemon on the simple idea that your device should be able to recognize you in a natural and passive way , like a human does , rather than you having to constantly re-enter ( and remember ) a device password .
Pioneering biometric authentication solutions via face recognition for nearly ten years , KeyLemon has continuously pursued its vision for convenient security through effortless user recognition .
Over the past decade , the technology company has remained true to this focus .
The American family may be under stress , but most children still live in two - parent households , the Census Bureau reported Wednesday .
Over all , 7 in 10 children live with two parents , about two - thirds live with two married parents , and about 6 in 10 live with both biological parents , according to the latest analysis , which is drawn from 2004 surveys .
In 1970 , 85 percent of children were living with two parents and 11 percent with their mother only , proportions that shifted to a little more than 70 percent and slightly more than 20 percent , respectively , in 1990 .
The comparable figures in 2004 were about 70 percent and 23 percent .
The figures suggest that the tumultuous shifts in family structure since the late 1960s have leveled off since 1990 .
There are a number of standard questions about libertarianism that have been periodically resurfacing in the politics groups for years .
This posting attempts to answer some of them .
I make no claim that the answers are complete , nor that they reflect a ( nonexistent ) unanimity among libertarians ; the issues touched on here are tremendously complex .
This posting will be useful , however , if it successfully conveys the flavor of libertarian thought and gives some indication of what most libertarians believe .
A. Definitions , Principles and History :
A1 . What is a libertarian ?
The word means approximately " believer in liberty " .
Libertarians believe in individual conscience and individual choice , and reject the use of force or fraud to compel others except in response to force or fraud .
( This latter is called the " Non-Coercion Principle " and is the one thing all libertarians agree on . )
A2 . What do libertarians want to do ?
Help individuals take more control over their own lives .
Take the state ( and other self - appointed representatives of " society " ) out of private decisions .
Abolish both halves of the welfare / warfare bureaucracy ( privatizing real services ) and liberate the 7/8ths of our wealth that 's now soaked up by the costs of a bloated and ineffective government , to make us all richer and freer .
Oppose tyranny everywhere , whether it's the obvious variety driven by greed and power - lust or the subtler , well - intentioned kinds that coerce people " for their own good " but against their wills .
A3 . Where does libertarianism come from ?
Modern libertarianism has multiple roots .
Perhaps the oldest is the minimal - government republicanism of the U.S. 's founding revolutionaries , especially Thomas Jefferson and the Anti-Federalists .
Adam Smith , John Stuart Mill and the " classical liberals " of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries were another key influence .
More recently , Ayn Rand 's philosophy of " ethical egoism " and the Austrian School of free - market capitalist economics have both contributed important ideas .
Libertarianism is alone among 20th - century secular radicalisms in owing virtually nothing to Marxism .
A4 . How do libertarians differ from " liberals " ?
Once upon a time ( in the 1800s ) , " liberal " and " libertarian " meant the same thing ; " liberals " were individualist , distrustful of state power , pro-free - market , and opposed to the entrenched privilege of the feudal and mercantilist system .
After 1870 , the " liberals " were gradually seduced ( primarily by the Fabian socialists ) into believing that the state could and should be used to guarantee " social justice " .
They largely forgot about individual freedom , especially economic freedom , and nowadays spend most of their time justifying higher taxes , bigger government , and more regulation .
Libertarians call this socialism without the brand label and want no part of it .
A5 .
How do libertarians differ from " conservatives " ?
For starters , by not being conservative .
Most libertarians have no interest in returning to an idealized past .
More generally , libertarians hold no brief for the right wing 's rather overt militarist , racist , sexist , and authoritarian tendencies and reject conservative attempts to " legislate morality " with censorship , drug laws , and obnoxious Bible - thumping .
Though libertarians believe in free - enterprise capitalism , we also refuse to stooge for the military - industrial complex as conservatives are wont to do .
A6 . Do libertarians want to abolish the government ?
Libertarians want to abolish as much government as they practically can .
About 3/4 are " minarchists " who favor stripping government of most of its accumulated power to meddle , leaving only the police and courts for law enforcement and a sharply reduced military for national defense ( nowadays some might also leave special powers for environmental enforcement ) .
The other 1/4 ( including the author of this FAQ ) are out - and - out anarchists who believe that " limited government " is a delusion and the free market can provide better law , order , and security than any goverment monopoly .
Also , current libertarian political candidates recognize that you can't demolish a government as large as ours overnight , and that great care must be taken in dismantling it carefully .
For example , libertarians believe in open borders , but unrestricted immigration now would attract in a huge mass of welfare clients , so most libertarians would start by abolishing welfare programs before opening the borders .
Libertarians do n't believe in tax - funded education , but most favor the current " parental choice " laws and voucher systems as a step in the right direction .
Progress in freedom and prosperity is made in steps .
The Magna Carta , which for the first time put limits on a monarchy , was a great step forward in human rights .
The parliamentary system was another great step .
The U.S. Constitution and Bill of Rights , which affirmed that even a democratically - elected government could n't take away certain inalienable rights of individuals , was probably the single most important advance so far .
But the journey is n't over .
A7 .
What 's the difference between small - l libertarian and big-l Libertarian ?
All Libertarians are libertarians , but not the reverse .
A libertarian is a person who believes in the Non-Coercion Principle and the libertarian program .
A Libertarian is a person who believes the existing political system is a proper and effective means of implementing those principles ; specifically , " Libertarian " usually means a member of the Libertarian Party , the U.S. 's largest and most successful third party .
Small - ell libertarians are those who consider the Libertarian Party tactically ineffective , or who reject the political system generally and view democracy as " the tyranny of the majority " .
A8 . How would libertarians fund vital public services ?
By privatizing them .
Taxation is theft -- if we must have a government , it should live on user fees , lotteries , and endowments .
A government that 's too big to function without resorting to extortion is a government that 's too big , period .
Insurance companies ( stripped of the state - conferred immunities that make them arrogant ) could use the free market to spread most of the risks we now " socialize " through government , and make a profit doing so .
A9 .
What would a libertarian " government " do and how would it work ?
Enforce contracts .
Anarcho - libertarians believe the " government " in this sense can be a loose network of rent - a - cops , insurance companies , and for - profit arbitration boards operating under a shared legal code ; minarchists believe more centralization would be necessary and envision something much like a Jeffersonian constitional government .
All libertarians want to live in a society based ( far more than ours now is ) on free trade and mutual voluntary contract ; the government 's job would be strictly to referee , and use the absolute minimum of force necessary to keep the peace .
B. Politics and Consequences :
B1 . What is the libertarian position on abortion ?
Most libertarians are strongly in favor of abortion rights ( the Libertarian Party often shows up at pro-rights rallies with banners that say " We 're Pro-Choice on Everything ! " ) .
Many libertarians are personally opposed to abortion , but reject governmental meddling in a decision that should be private between a woman and her physician .
Most libertarians also oppose government funding of abortions , on the grounds that " pro-lifers " should not have to subsidize with their money behavior they consider to be murder .
B2 .
What is the libertarian position on minority , gay & women 's rights ?
Libertarians believe that every human being is entitled to equality before the law and fair treatment as an individual responsible for his or her own actions .
We oppose racism , sexism , and sexual - preference bigotry , whether perpetrated by private individuals or ( especially ) by government .
We reject racial discrimination , whether in its ugly traditional forms or in its newer guises as Affirmative Action quotas and " diversity " rules .
We recognize that there will always be bigotry and hatred in the world , just as there will always be fear and stupidity ; but one cannot use laws to force understanding any more than one can use laws to force courage or intelligence .
The only fair laws are those that never mention the words " black " or " white " ; " man " or " woman " ; " gay " or " straight " .
When people use bigotry as an excuse to commit force or fraud , it is the act itself which is the crime , and deserves punishment , not the motive behind it .
B3 . What is the libertarian position on gun control ?
Consistently opposed .
The revolutionaries who kicked out King George based their call for insurrection on the idea that Americans have not only the right but the duty to oppose a tyrannical government with force -- and that duty implies readiness to use force .
This is why Thomas Jefferson said that " Firearms are the American yeoman 's liberty teeth " and , in common with many of the Founding Fathers , asserted that an armed citizenry is the securest guarantee of freedom .
Libertarians assert that " gun control " is a propagandist 's lie for " people control " , and even if it worked for reducing crime and violence ( which it does not ; when it's a crime to own guns , only criminals own them ) it would be a fatally bad bargain .
B4 .
What is the libertarian position on art , pornography and censorship ?
Libertarians are opposed to any government - enforced limits on free expression whatsoever ; we take an absolutist line on the First Amendment .
On the other hand , we reject the " liberal " idea that refusing to subsidize a controversial artist is censorship .
Thus , we would strike down all anti-pornography laws as unwarranted interference with private and voluntary acts ( leaving in place laws punishing , for example , coercion of minors for the production of pornography ) .
We would also end all government funding of art ; the label of " artist " confers no special right to a living at public expense .
B5 .
What is the libertarian position on the draft ?
We believe the draft is slavery , pure and simple , and ought to be prohibited as " involuntary servitude " by the 13th Amendment .
Any nation that cannot find enough volunteers to defend it among its citizenry does not deserve to survive .
B6 .
What is the libertarian position on the " drug war " ?
That all drugs should be legalized .
Drug - related crime ( which is over 85 % of all crime ) is caused not by drugs but by drug laws that make the stuff expensive and a monopoly of criminals .
This stance is n't " approving " of drugs any more than defending free speech is " approving " of Nazi propaganda ; it 's just realism -- prohibition does n't work .
And the very worst hazard of the drug war may be the expansion of police powers through confiscation laws , " no - knock " warrants and other " anti-drug " measures .
These tactics can't stop the drug trade , but they are making a mockery of our supposed Constitutional freedoms .
Libertarians would leave in place laws against actions which directly endanger the physical safety of others , like driving under the influence of drugs , or carrying a firearm under the influence .
B7 .
What would libertarians do about concentrations of corporate power ?
First of all , stop creating them as our government does with military contractors and government - subsidized industries .
Second , create a more fluid economic environment in which they 'd break up .
This happens naturally in a free market ; even in ours , with taxes and regulatory policies that encourage gigantism , it 's quite rare for a company to stay in the biggest 500 for longer than twenty years .
We 'd abolish the limited - liability shield laws to make corporate officers and stockholders fully responsible for a corporation 's actions .
We 'd make it impossible for corporations to grow fat on " sweetheart deals " paid for with taxpayers ' money ; we 'd lower the cost of capital ( by cutting taxes ) and regulatory compliance ( by repealing regulations that presume guilt until you prove your innocence ) , encouraging entrepreneurship and letting economic conditions ( rather than government favoritism ) determine the optimum size of the business unit .
C. Standard Criticisms
C1 .
But what about the environment ?
Who speaks for the trees ?
Who owns the trees ?
The disastrous state of the environment in what was formerly the Soviet Union illustrates the truism that a resource theoretically " owned " by everyone is valued by no one .
Ecological awareness is a fine thing , but without strong private - property rights no one can afford to care enough to conserve .
Libertarians believe that the only effective way to save the Earth is to give everyone economic incentives to save their little bit of it .
C2 .
Do n't strong property rights just favor the rich ?
No .
What favors the rich is the system we have now -- a fiction of strong property rights covering a reality of property by government fiat ; the government can take away your " rights " by eminent domain , condemnation , taxation , regulation and a thousand other means .
Because the rich have more money and time to spend on influencing and subverting government , such a system inevitably means they gain at others ' expense .
A strong government always becomes the tool of privilege .
Stronger property rights and a smaller government would weaken the power elite that inevitably seeks to seduce government and bend it to their own self - serving purposes --- an elite far more dangerous than any ordinary criminal class .
C3 . Would libertarians just abandon the poor ?
No , though abandoning the poor might be merciful compared to what government has done to them .
As the level of " anti-poverty " spending in this country has risen , so has poverty .
Government bureaucracies have no incentive to lift people out of dependency and every incentive to keep them in it ; after all , more poverty means a bigger budget and more power for the bureaucrats .
Libertarians want to break this cycle by abolishing all income - transfer programs and allowing people to keep what they earn instead of taxing it away from them .
The wealth freed up would go directly to the private sector , creating jobs for the poor , decreasing the demand on private charity , and increasing charitable giving .
The results might diminish poverty or they might leave it at today 's levels -- but it's hard to see how they could be any less effective than the present wretched system .
C4 .
What about national defense ?
This issue makes minarchists out of a lot of would - be anarchists .
One view is that in a libertarian society everyone would be heavily armed , making invasion or usurpation by a domestic tyrant excessively risky .
This is what the Founding Fathers clearly intended for the U.S. ( the Constitution made no provision for a standing army , entrusting defense primarily to a militia consisting of the entirety of the armed citizenry ) .
It works today in Switzerland ( also furnishing one of the strongest anti-gun - control arguments ) .
The key elements in libertarian - anarchist defense against an invader would be : a widespread ideology ( libertarianism ) that encourages resistance ; ready availability of deadly weapons ; and no structures of government that an invader can take over and use to rule indirectly .
Think about the Afghans , the Viet Cong , the Minutemen -- would you want to invade a country full of dedicated , heavily armed libertarians ? :-)
Minarchist libertarians are less radical , observe that U.S. territory could certainly be protected effectively with a military costing less than half of the bloated U.S. military budget .
C5 .
Do n't you believe in cooperating ?
Should n't people help each other ?
Voluntary cooperation is a wonderful thing , and we encourage it whenever we can .
Despite the tired old tag line about " dog-eat - dog competition " and the presence of government intervention , the relatively free market of today 's capitalism is the most spectacular argument for voluntary cooperation in history ; millions , even billions of people coordinating with each other every day to satisfy each others ' needs and create untold wealth .
What we oppose is the mockeries politicians and other criminals call cooperation but impose by force ; there is no " cooperation " in taxation or the draft or censorship any more than you and I are " cooperating " when I put a gun to your head and steal your wallet .
D. Prospects
D1 . How can I get involved ?
Think about freedom , and act on your thoughts .
Spend your dollars wisely .
Oppose the expansion of state power .
Promote " bottom - up " solutions to public problems , solutions that empower individuals rather than demanding intervention by force of government .
Give to private charity .
Join a libertarian organization ; the Libertarian Party , or the Advocates for Self - Government , or the Reason Foundation .
Start your own business ; create wealth and celebrate others who create wealth .
Support voluntary cooperation .
D2 .
Is libertarianism likely to get a practical test in my lifetime ?
No one knows .
Your author thinks libertarianism is about where constitutional republicanism was in 1750 -- a solution waiting for its moment , a toy of political theorists and a few visionaries waiting for the people and leaders who can actualize it .
The collapse of Communism and the triumph of capitalist economics will certainly help , by throwing central planning and the " nanny state " into a disrepute that may be permanent .
Some libertarians believe we are headed for technological and economic changes so shattering that no statist ideology can possibly survive them ( in particular , most of the nanotechnology " underground " is hard - core libertarian ) .
Only time will tell .

Web Component Development with Zope 3 の前書きにEJBがコメントを寄せているが、 なかなか面白いと思ったので、ざっくり翻訳してみる。 ちなみに、原文はここにもある。 以下、翻訳 。
Zopeの導くところへ 、Pythonはついて行く。
長年続いてきたけれど、この潮流は止まりそうな気配さえない。
最新の宣伝文句が何であろうと、RESTful
Webプログラミングだろうが、 標準化インタフェースだろうが、プラグ可能コンポーネントだろうが、
実用的制限実行環境だろうが、 Zopeは控えめに行き先を先導し、他の誰よりも何年も先を行って、
本物を送り届けてきた。 技術上の概念だけではなくって、ちゃんとお金を払っている顧客のオフィスに届けられ、稼働してきたんだ。
ところが奇妙なことに、進みつづけるPythonの開発の中で、
Zopeの役割 はPython開発者たちの間でさっぱり知られず、評価もされていない。
Pythonコミュニティで何か新しくて持ち上げられてる開発が、 特に、Webアプリケーションとかオブジェクトセキュリティとかの世界で、
Zopeではもう何年もそれやってきたことだよ、なんてのが頻繁にあるんだ。
Pythonコミュニティの、こんな奇妙な盲点を見てると、私は少々まごついてしまう。
みんながやっていることはZopeがもうやってるよと教えてあげても、
大抵反応はぽかんとされるか、反応なしかなんだ。
それはまるで、誰か他の人が再発明するまで、Zopeの革新は存在しないかのようなんだ。
実のところ、そうした傾向を見ているうちに、こんなちょっとした言葉を思い付いてしまった。
Zopeを学ばない者は、再発明することを運命づけられる。
Zopeを実際に使おうと思っているかどうかは関係ないんだ。 率直に言って、私 はZopeを何年も使ってない。 でもZopeから得た教訓は、絶えず使っている。 Zope、とりわ けZope3を学ぶことで、疑問の余地なく、もっといいプログラマになれるんだ。
当然、 「もっといいプログラマ」って、どうもっといいんだ？とか、
何をできるのがもっとよくなるの？とかいう質問になるだろうね。
Zopeは 、Zope Corporation ( 旧 Digital Creations , LLC ) が請負業務をもっと効率的に行えるように作成された。
おかげで、進化しつづけるツールキットを用いて、再利用可能なソリューションを顧客に提供し、同時にそうしたアプリケーションの開発や保守のコストを削減することができたんだ。 その目的は「一度だけ書いて、何度も使う」という規模の経済効果を生み出すことなんだ。
もしこれがあなたのキャリアが辿る道筋なら、 そうした目的のために本当にZopeを使おうか使うまいが、
Zopeではどうやって実現されているのかを学ぶと、 ためになることばかりなんだ。
もしPython用に何か新規のものや最新技術を開発しているんなら、
「 Zopeにはすでにこんなものか、似たようなものがあるだろうか。 もしないとしたら、Zopeだとこれはどうやって使うだろう」と問いかけると、得るものが大きい。 これこそ、 私がPython Eggsやsetuptools 、WSGI ( Python Web Server Gateway Interface ) の仕様書を開発していたときに発した質問だったんだ。 これらのプロジェクトがうまくいったのは
、WWZD : Zopeなら（このアイデアで）どうやる？ ( What Would Zope Do ? ) を尋ねたことが直接的に結果に繋がったんだ。
どうしてかというと 、Zopeにいいことは、大 抵Pythonにもいいことだから。 言語上のって意味じゃないよ、 Pythonの 「 慈悲深い独裁者 」 ( 訳注： Guido van Rossumのこと ) と 「 Zopeの教祖 」 ( 訳注：Jim Fultonのこと ) は言語の変更の仕方については頻繁に激しくけんかしているからね。
自分が言いたいのは 、Zopeをより良いプラットフォームにするツールは、
Pythonをもより良いプラットフォームにするってことなんだ。 そして、Zopeをこつこつ勉強してみれば、きっとなぜなのかがわかるようになると思う。
それから、ひょっとすると、もしかしたらってだけなんだけど、
特に新しいアイデアに至ったとき、他のプログラマよりちょっぴり前を進んでいる感じを受けるようになるだろうね...
でも出来ればあんまり前に行き過ぎないように、そうでないと、
みんな今度はあなたも存在しないかのように振る舞い始めちゃうからね！
幸運を祈る ！
