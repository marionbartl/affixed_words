The Tourism Minister Liz Constable is disappointed at the cancellation of an international air race over the Swan River .
Perth is one of the legs of the air race series along with other host cities such as New York , Rio de Janeiro and Abu Dhabi , which have also been cancelled .
The organisers Red Bull say the one year 's break will be used to revise the organisation and commercial aspects of the event , although there has been speculation it has been forced by the global financial crisis .
Dr Constable says the Government will continue to push for more big events .
" Because we know the value of those events to the tourism industry but also to publicising world - wide Perth and Western Australia to potential visitors , " she said .
The race was first held in Perth in 2006 and usually attracts hundreds of thousands of spectators .
The chairwoman of Tourism WA Kate Lamont believes economic uncertainty is behind the cancellation .
" They ( the organisers ) are pretty tight - lipped about it , but if I read under the lines I think it 's commercial reasons , " she said .
" A lot of us in WA have forgotten about the GFC but I think it's hit pretty hard and continues to hit hard in Europe and I think it 's simply a victim of that . "
Matt Hall is a former RAAF fighter pilot sponsored by the WA State Government in this year 's race in Perth .
He does not believe it is the end of the air races .
" That 's my career and I love racing the aircraft and I love doing that but I also see a positive side of it already that we actually get to develop for a year , " he said .
" You have a year 's dedicated development ( which ) leads to a better sport in the end . "

This is only the beginning of a story , but it could prove to be a very interesting story if it bears out .
I think it already contains instructive lessons for game development and design .
On the left , Dwarf Fortress .
On the right , Goblin Camp .
I hope you know about Dwarf Fortress , the very complex roguelike - lookinglike fantasy world sim / citybuilder .
From a development perspective , DF is a very long - running obsessive project coded by one guy , Tarn Adams , who makes more money than I do ( not difficult ) entirely by donations from his fans .
I admire Tarn ’s goals and his creative freedom which lets him indulge his whims – I wish I could do that .
I even had fun playing some Dwarf Fortress until I explored most of what there was to explore .
It was sweet while it lasted , but I grew tired with the tedium of a very rough user interface and tedious gameplay .
This brings me to a common criticism of Dwarf Fortress : development over the last year , year and a half has focused on revising very low level details about the game ’s simulation of how materials interact , particularly how creatures bodies are built with layers of bone and muscle and hair , what properties these each have , etc .
It is true that part of the charm of Dwarf Fortress is about the ridiculous level of detail .
But it has been over a year and I still have to press a series of awkward keyboard shortcuts to build things , I need to hand - designate every square of ore to be mined , I need to tell each workshop exactly what to make .
Frankly , the user interface achieves mind - blowing levels of confusion and unnecessarily repeated actions which lead to a sense of tedium and frustration that overwhelms my interest in continuing the play the game – so I do n’t .
Many people do n’t even manage to fully learn to use the interface ( or do n’t want to ) due to – I ’ll say it – how bad it is .
And further , most new players are overcome by the sheer detail and volume of information that needs to be processed and managed by hand :
To speak for my own experience ( to those of the DF community that hold in high regard their ability to manage an extraordinarily complex game ) , it ’s not that I am incapable of running a complex Dwarf Fortress game , it ’s just that I do n’t want to because it ’s boring to have to hand - tweak every little thing to keep the place running , and worse still , it actually hurts my hands to press the same keys again and again and again as is required .
I love what this game could be and reading the development page it is full of admirable , sky - high aspirations .
But I ca n’t bring myself to play it .
It ’s a beautiful idea but an extremely flawed game .
To get the Dwarf Fortress Experience , you ’re better off reading the stories people write about their games in forums , eg. the classic Boatmurdered .
This removes the frustration of playing the game itself and gives you the high points of amusement at the absurd details and situations which arise during gameplay ( which inspired a good deal of the silliness we have in Dungeons of Dredmor , I should add ) .
And then , if the post ’s timestamp is correct , just two days ago on July 14 , Ilkka Halila announced Goblin Camp in the Something Awful forums .
Now things are getting interesting .
Goblin Camp looks like Dwarf Fortress , uses the same ASCII - graphics , and starts from a foundation of the same sort of gameplay built upon semi-autonomous agents collecting and processing resources in a world build of tiles , but it makes several important departures in terms of project development and design philosophy .
The code of Goblin Camp is released open source .
In interviews , Tarn Adams has expressed concern about releasing DF ’s code because he could lose control over the focus of the project , lose financial support , and he is not interested in supporting other people modifying ( and breaking ) the code .
Goblin Camp has already been extended by coders other than Ilkka – if the initial interest maintains its present momentum , the game could develop at an extraordinarily rapid pace .
I must observe though that GC ’s appeal is somewhat cannibalistic on DF ’s –
It is frustrated DF fans that are excited about CG .
Goblin Camp streamlines play .
For example , there is a central depository of craft goods in GC which the player gives orders like “ Maintain a stock of 500 wood planks ” .
Workers are automatically assigned tasks to fulfill this requests , they are sent out in the woods to cut logs which are returned to a carpenters shop to be processed .
In DF , one would have to designate a single worker as a lumberjack , scroll out into the map , designate an area of trees for chopping ( using the keyboard , by the way ) , then queue tasks in a carpenters shop by - hand .
When designated trees run out , the player has to re-designate more trees – and the player is not told when they run out of designated trees .
GC handles the minutiae for the player , reducing the hand - interaction required from perhaps 10 actions to one action , at least .
To be frank , this design ethos of streamlining interaction blows DF out of the water in terms of playability already ( Dwarf Fortress was released four years ago , by the way ) .
Goblin Camp abstracts details .
While DF has spent a year of development time simulating the material properties required to properly model the penetration of an iron bolt through leather armor , flesh , and bone , as appropriate to the details of a given creature ’s anatomy , GC was coded in its entirety in two months and uses simple die rolls for attack skill and damage .
The resulting playability of each game ’s combat is not a radically different experience : guys swarm each other and people get chopped to bits .
The idea of abstracting small details to implement fun features more quickly appears to lay behind every aspect of GC ’s development .
Further , the mod-friendly and open source nature of the game allows other people to fill in small details at their whim while the primary developer concentrates on the more general framework of gameplay .
Goblin Camp was made , to paraphrase Ilkka , because he loved the sort of game that is Dwarf Fortress but he is impatient and wants to play the game DF could be , that he wants DF to be , now rather than waiting for Tarn to add certain features to Dwarf Fortress – if he ever does .
A game like Goblin Camp was bound to happen in response to Dwarf Fortress , and I think Tarn and many others knew it would come .
I ’m pretty sure similar attempts have been made ( there was an Elf Forest joke - game , I believe ) , but none seem to have really taken off .
Maybe Goblin Camp will .
Goblin Camp , as a game and an approach to development , is a critical response to weaknesses in the game and development of Dwarf Fortress .
Maybe Tarn will have to react to Goblin Camp out of a need to save his source of income , maybe he will re-focus on making Dwarf Fortress a playable game rather than a complex simulation lost in it ’s own obsessive detail , accessible only to an extremely dedicated few .
It ’s like Josh Petrie ’s advice to beginning game developers : “ Write Games , Not Engines ” mixed with the ethos and methodology of Open Source software , Wiki - style content , and the absurd power of the internet .
I can’t wait to see what happens next .

Dear Straight Dope :
This is a question I have often pondered . . . how does glue work ?
What makes it bind things together ?
Randy Jones , Tucson , Arizona
Una replies :
We ’re not entirely sure .
That ’s a little surprising , I know .
Glues ( more properly called adhesives ) have been around for thousands of years .
Beeswax and tar were among the earliest–there ’s an extensive archeological record of their use .
Later came adhesives derived from plants and animals –for example , carpenter ’s glue made from slaughterhouse leftovers such as hides and bones .
Modern manufactured adhesives arrived on the scene around 1910 , when phenol formaldehyde adhesives were developed for making plywood .
Next came acrylic adhesives , cyanoacrylates ( also known as " super glue " ) , epoxies , and so on .
A good adhesive has excellent properties of adhesion ( the ability to stick to the surfaces to which it ’s applied ) and cohesion ( the ability to stick to itself ) .
When you pull apart something that ’s been glued together and the glue comes right off the pieces , that ’s an adhesive failure .
If the glue itself splits apart , leaving glue on either side of the joint , then that ’s a cohesive failure :
Adhesion and cohesion are both important for an adhesive to work .
For example , while tar has high adhesion ( as anyone who has worked on a roof can testify ) , it ’s not so hot at cohesion .
While it can be used for some low - strength applications , it ’s not really a high - strength adhesive .
Now to your core question .
Research continues to this day on exactly what happens when two objects stick together .
There ’s no universally accepted theory , and given the variety of adhesives more than one process may be at work .
It ’s generally agreed that adhesion occurs at the molecular level , the chief processes involved being Van der Waals forces , ionic bonding , covalent bonding , and metallic bonding .
The last three types of bonding are the result of chemical reactions that do n’t have much to do with glue , so we ’ll confine our discussion to Van der Waals forces , with a little excursion into mechanical bonding thrown in .
Van der Waals forces come into play when molecules are polarized –that is , they have a positive end and a negative end .
The following graphic shows the polarity of a water molecule due to the angle of 104.5° between the two hydrogen atoms .
Because the hydrogen atoms are skewed to one side , one end of the molecule has a weakly positive charge and the other has a weakly negative charge .
Since opposites attract , the positive side of one water molecule will be attracted to the negative side of a neighboring one .
That ’s the Van der Waals force .
For Van der Waals forces to work , there must be close contact between the two surfaces being joined–a separation of only a few angstroms .
( An angstrom is one ten - billionth of a meter . )
At that range the Van der Waals and other molecular forces interact strongly and the adhesive and the glued surfaces bond together .
To ensure close contact , the adhesive must have the ability to wet the surfaces of the parts properly –it must spread and flow such that it maintains the maximum contact area possible , and it should spread thinly to avoid being subject to cohesive failures .
According to recent research , Van der Waals forces explain how the lizards known as geckos can stick to so many surfaces in a seemingly impossible manner .
Specifically , the tiny hairs on the gecko’s feet ( called setae ) are split at the microscopic level into " as many as 1,000 branches , whose spatula - shaped tips are only 200 nanometers wide . "
As a result , even though the Van der Waals forces acting on an individual tip is small , the adhesion of a billion or so tips adds up to enough force to let the gecko stick to anything .
Persuasive as all this sounds , other scientists doubt that Van der Waals forces alone fully explain how glue works .
They attribute at least some of the strength of adhesives to mechanical bonding , also known as mechanical locking .
The idea here is that all surfaces , even seemingly smooth ones , are actually rough at the molecular level , and that an adhesive achieves some of its strength by flowing into the hidden valleys and imperfections of the surfaces to be bonded .
When the adhesive hardens , the two parts are mechanically locked together , like so :
In mechanical bonding as with Van der Waals forces , an adhesive needs to be able to spread finely into the microscopic roughness of the surfaces , wet the tiny cracks properly , and allow trapped air to escape .
The main difference is that mechanical bonding will work at distances that would render Van der Waals forces useless .
There are several other theories of adhesion that I ought to mention briefly .
The electrostatic theory arose in part from the observation that some adhesives generate static sparks when pulled apart , while other items will cling together when placed next to each other , especially in the case of plastics .
The theory proposes that as the joint forms , electrostatic charges develop between the two joined surfaces and between the surfaces and the adhesive , and these electrical forces help hold the joint together .
But electrostatic forces are believed to be only a supplemental source of joint strength , not the primary one .
Adhesion can also occur when both the adhesive and the parts being joined have long chains of molecules that are chemically soluble in each other .
In this case , it ’s believed that some of the long molecule chains at the surfaces will diffuse or interlink physically into each other , working like dog hair into the fibers of your couch .
Again , this is not thought to be a primary source of strength in adhesive joints .
Still another type of adhesion involves the presence of tiny air bubbles –in 1999 , French researchers presented a theory in Discover magazine that instant adhesives ( like that used in Scotch - brand tape and Post - It notes ) actually work by creating numerous microscopic bubbles each having a partial vacuum in them , which act as suction cups .
Lastly , some glues such as those used for plastic hobby models chemically weld pieces together .
These glues slightly melt and diffuse into the parts being joined .
This can make a very solid joint , but at the cost of changing the structure and shape of the pieces being joined , so they ’re not suitable for some uses .
But they ’re fine for assembling model ships .
To summarize , the primary force at work in most cases of adhesion is most likely Van der Waals forces resulting from polarized molecules , coupled with some degree of mechanical locking .
The proper amount of surface roughness seems key in making a strong adhesive joint –while a rough surface is useful because it has a large surface area and thus a high potential for mechanical locking , it ’s difficult to clean , allowing impurities and trapped air to weaken the joint .
A smooth surface allows for easy cleaning and liberation of air but reduces opportunities for mechanical locking .
Each glue has an optimal level of roughness and certain types of surfaces to which it ’s best suited , so follow the manufacturer ’s recommendations to make sure your adhesives adhere .

Revival Horror : New Ideas in Fear - Making
By Michael Thomsen
As the emotional palette of video games expanded in the mid-Nineties , the horror genre flourished .
It brought variation on the familiar themes of performance anxiety , adrenaline rush , and achievement that had been the interactive motor behind Mario , Sonic , Madden , DOOM , and Quake .
Flipping the constant - adrenaline - feed model on its head , games like Alone in the Dark , Resident Evil , System Shock , and Silent Hill put players in claustrophobic environments with controls that often made players feel helpless and vulnerable .
In recent years , though , the horror genre has encountered some cultural drift .
Games like Resident Evil 5 and BioShock 2 still sell millions , but the spark of emotional ingenuity that made SHODAN , Lisa Trevor , and Pyramid Head so terrifyingly memorable seems to have diffused beneath a veneer of action and multiplayer modes .
While some of the old franchises have succumbed to predictability -- the most lethal fault in works of suspense -- a group of newcomers have added much - needed inspiration to the genre .
Visceral Games ' Dead Space was a lean and steely refinement of the original Resident Evil formula , for example .
Tale of Tale 's
The Path invited hallucinatory dislocation into its gameplay , while several of Goichi Suda 's games have mixed camp and gore in the Dario Argento mold .
Last year Climax Studios made Silent Hill : Shattered Memories , an accomplished feat of atmosphere , lurid suggestion , and shrill terror .
Is there hope that this new wave of game designers can rekindle the creative spark of a genre that once seemed revelatory ?
Is the future of the genre going to be defined by action convention ?
Or are there dark corners that developers have yet to turn ?
What design challenges lie ahead , waiting for those developers who try and carry the flame forward ?
Mood Lighting and Monster Closets
The predicament in all horror games is the manner in which they deal with combat .
In non -horror games it 's easy to use combat as the defining gameplay mechanic because there 's no need to keep mysterious the beasts lurking in the shadows .
In horror , the moment when a monster becomes familiar is when the tension and dread begins to deflate .
There 's no limit to fear of the unknown , but as soon as an enemy is quantifiable the boundaries are drawn .
Fear will eventually become supplanted with frustration or , worse , tedium .
" It 's most important to us that the player never gets too familiar with the creatures encountered , " said Thomas Grip of Frictional Games , creators of the Penumbra series and the forthcoming Amnesia .
" When a player encounters an enemy enough times , movement patterns and such will quickly get established and the creature will become a familiar gameplay object instead of an unknown , lurking horror . "
The traditional way of guarding against familiarity is in designing combat scenarios where the player is notably weaker than she 'd expect to be .
The Fatal Frame series left players without standard weaponry , providing only a camera to separate them from antagonistic apparitions .
" It 's difficult to make players really feel afraid without manipulating the power balance between them and the enemies , " Goichi Suda , president of Grasshopper Manufacture and producer on the newest Fatal Frame , told me .
" But there are a lot of games that can evoke horror in a player while still using weapon - based combat . "
Dead Space
Visceral 's Dead Space is one of the most successful combinations of lurking dread and high - intensity combat in recent years .
" Pacing is critical in a horror game , " said Steve Papoutsis of Visceral .
" You need to allow room for the player to feel safe or experience relief in order to deliver the next startle or scare . "
" The big challenge is really having all of your primary elements in place early enough so you can play around with them .
Horror moments require a full team effort to execute , they rely on Audio , Lighting , Design , Animation , Characters , VFX -- pretty much all of the disciplines on the team -- so having a plan in place and having the elements ready to play with is what really helps . "
As much as any other genre , horror games are defined by aesthetic sensibility that must form a cohesive and ambient environment for gameplay .
If combat against enemies is going to be used , the enemy encounters must naturally be lessened , placing added importance on using art and sound cues to guide a player 's emotions before and after a fight sequence .
" One wants to have a some kind of slower pacing before an encounter , and also provide some kind of build up , " Grip said .
" It 's important to take care of the time before and after an encounter . "
" Before an enemy is seen the player 's imagination will try to figure out the appearance of a monster and after the encounter the player should hopefully fear the creature .
This means that enemies should be placed in such a way that one can get the most out of the time before and after encounters , as it is there that the true horror resides . "
Climax 's Silent Hill : Shattered Memories made special use of audio design elements to keep players uncertain of what they would discover ahead , even in areas that were clearly demarcated to not have enemies .
" We had a dynamic sound system where , if you 're not doing something important , you 'll have one or two base tracks , " Tomm Hulett , producer for Konami on Shattered Memories , told me .
" If something scary happens , we 'll amp it up and there 'll be a lot more sound going on .
Or if we want you to be scared we can amp it up so that you get that subconscious suggestion that something is around the corner . "
Controller Anxiety
In the past , horror games relied on rigid controls that obscured player initiative with arcane rotational movement and layers of item management .
With this approach having less frequent enemy encounters would still be fearful because of how traumatically challenging simple navigation under stress could be .
" I think an important bit is for the games to have a certain simplicity to the controls so that they can easily be explained at the start and become second nature for the player as early on as possible , " Grip explained .
" Even when new kinds of actions , like hiding in a closet , were introduced later on , the same kind of mechanics were used .
The player never had to focus on learning how to play the game once the introductory sequences were passed . "
Intuitive controls were equally important for Shattered Memories , in large part because of the added abilities of the Wii's motion controller .
" We wanted to use that to enhance the immersion , " Hulett explained .
" Our theory was if you felt like you were actually a part of the game and the action , then you 'd feel more scared because you 'd feel more threatened . "
The result was a great array of motions to control objects in the environment , from opening doors and drawers to rearranging desktop decorations to solve a silhouette puzzle .
In early 3D horror games , fear was largely built on the anticipation of the next enemy encounter , but with games like Shattered Memories and the Penumbra series a deeper layer of psychological dread emerges from mundane environmental exploration .
Shattered Memories makes explicitly clear when players will and wo n't be attacked by enemies thanks to its veil of ice .
Silent Hill : Shattered Memories
Amazingly , there 's still a sense of psychological unease in simple acts like opening a drawer or coming into a new room .
It offers a new kind of fear built on a personalized dread drawn from the surreal story elements and the framing device of a constantly watching psychiatrist .
It as much about questioning what your behavior might give away as it is about solving puzzles .
With The Path , Tale of Tales -- the design duo of Michaël Samyn and Auriea Harvey -- built an experience of fearful discovery without combat .
The player 's time in the game is not spent completing objectives or advancing levels , but rather exploring the environment and building their own associations .
" We never set out to just evoke fear or horror in the player , " they told me .
" We build a certain well - defined atmosphere , but we try to leave the emotional response to this atmosphere as open as possible .
As a result , certain parts of our games have been experienced as distressing by some players and relaxing by others . "
To encourage players to invest in their games as a process of self - directed revelation , Tale of Tales adheres to a simple control scheme uncluttered by visual prompts .
" We do n't like buttons and text .
We find them distracting .
And our games are usually very freeform , " Tale of Tales said .
" There 's nothing you really need to do .
There 's no pressure .
There 's no punishment for failure .
There 's no failure , even .
So if you do n't know how to achieve certain things , maybe that 's just part of your particular experience of the game . "
While this approach might seem anathema to some players , it 's one that encourages personal engagement to the maximum .
As players progress through their experience they form their own interpretations and connections , drawing patterns out of the billowing murk .
The things they begin to fear most are n't the resuscitated burn victims with scissor fingers lurking in the next room , but rather some vague agglomeration of their own worst imagination .
To have touched a player on the terms of their most intimate insecurities and fears , rather than forcing them into the whirligig of an auteur 's invented phantoms , is one of the most delicate and rewarding achievements in game design .
Love and Guts
In mining areas that could yield deep - seated fear in a large audience , sex and death should be the alpha and the omega from which all other fears germinate .
Horror films have long exploited the lurid fear of sex and death from Hitchcock 's peeping tom serial killer to Eli Roth 's brothel - cum - butcher shop .
Sex remains a uniquely sensitive theme , but horror games have excelled in the death category with a happy exploitation of gore and inside - out anatomy .
While viewing gory imagery is uncomfortable for many , it 's the suggestion of something human that creates a lasting psychological footprint .
" You want to make sure that the gore supports a situation , is relatable in some way , and is done to enhance not overpower a sequence or scene , " Patsoupis said .
" Big gross , scary monsters are cool , but what we thought would really bring home the horror was having the enemies contain a human and relatable element .
Once the team zeroed in on that idea they did a ton more drawings and eventually came up with our Necromorphs . "
With Shattered Memories , the enemy design was likewise crafted over a series of iterations to find the balance between gore and some discernible hint of a once - untouched human .
" We spent a lot of time perfecting the screaming sound , " Hulett said .
" That went through five or six different iterations . "
" Some of them were like , ' Hey that 's creepy , but it also kind of sounds like a duck . '
Weird things where if someone heard it in that way it would n't be scary anymore , and we could n't let that happen .
I think the final one is actually a voice that 's been filtered , distorted , and stretched out to have an inhuman quality while you can still sense there was actually a person at one point making that sound . "
By leaving identifiable traces of humanity in monsters , it encourages players to subconsciously consider how someone could have been so violently transformed .
In imagining the different possibilities the seeds of sociopathy are sown in the players ' pattern - seeking minds .
They begin to imagine the logistics of gruesome acts in the same way a depraved killer might , and this dark realization suggests a guilt that amplifies the terror in seeing a mutilated creature .
" In Amnesia a big part of the story revolves around torture , and rather than just show gory imagery for the ' fun ' of it , we tried to approach it more seriously , " Grip said .
" Torture is truly repulsive , among the worst things people do to one another .
Almost all people agree on this .
Yet , people will very easily approve its usage and even perform it themselves -- as shown in the Milgram Experiments . "
Even the smallest hint of sexuality in an environment so filled with worst - case scenarios can add terrifying layers of confusion , lust , and insecurity .
" Sex is a common thread in all human beings , but it 's also something we 're really vulnerable about , " Hulett said .
" We do n't like talking about it in general , we might brag and lie about it .
When you present that in a horror context , the way your inner-most secrets can come out , you 're at your most vulnerable and you 're naturally uncomfortable , there are a lot of emotions there that horror can springboard off of . "
Tale of Tales ' works often commingle death and seduction , building on a similarly personal sense of those inner-most desires which we often fear as the most dangerous .
" Death in itself is seductive , because it is unknown and thus causes curiosity , " Tale of Tales said .
" Only the unknown , the mysterious can be truly seductive . "
" The Path is about giving in to your desires , giving in to seduction , knowing full well that it will lead to destruction . "
Myself Am Hell
Brett Easton Ellis said he does n't remember a large part of the time he spent writing American Psycho .
He 'd sit down with a pad of paper and pen , often thrumming with chemicals , and by morning he'd wake up from a blackout and there would be a stack of pages on the table .
This might be the embellishment of a backward - looking writer , but it seems like a fair account of the creation of a protagonist who made a necklace with the vertebrae of his victims while listening to Robert Palmer on a Walkman .
Books and movies about horror have served as a kind of looking glass through which we could peer into the terrors of another person 's imagination .
In horror games , designers have the tools to trap their audience inside that looking glass and force them to reckon with whatever terrors they can imagine .
" It is the only genre where it is okay to sacrifice gameplay in order to create emotions and build atmosphere , " Grip said .
" Because of this I think horror games are a very good place to try new things and to evolve the game medium . "
In large part , horror games have focused on instilling fear in players through confrontation with monsters , zombies , and demons , all storybook abstractions who become absurd when considered in the sober light of day .
It 's not really zombies that scare us , but the horror of aging .
Demons are n't frightful because of their bat wings and clawed appendages , but rather the idea that there are irremediable consequences to our life choices .
As the genre evolves , the bete noir must necessarily become a clearer and more honest reflection of ourselves .
" Having a stroke or heart attack is super scary and something we have not yet tried to do in a game , " Papoutsis said .
" I also think it would be really cool to have a character with a severe fear of heights and have that pay off in a very impactful way .
I think all three of those things would be really intense and terrifying if done well . "
Repetition is the biggest trap of continuing the traditions of the past .
It 's the easiest guarantor of success and the most comfortable environment in which to face down the unknowable questions of what else can be done .
" Horror games need to make audiences scared to death , " Suda told me .
" That 's it . "
It 's a simple concept , but one that 's overwhelmingly difficult to answer honestly .
What scares you to death ?
Is it a zombie ?
A ghost ?
A dog with two heads ?
Something with tentacles ?
The more familiar those ideas become , the further away we drift from the truth of horror , which lies in ourselves .
The first step in breathing new life into horror games comes not in reanimating someone else 's monsters , but in sitting by yourself in a room with all the lights turned out , staring into the darkness .

Gurkha ordered back to UK after beheading dead Taliban fighter
A Gurkha soldier has been flown back to the UK after hacking the head off a dead Taliban commander with his ceremonial knife to prove the dead man ’s identity .
The private , from 1st Battalion , Royal Gurkha Rifles , was involved in a fierce firefight with insurgents in the Babaji area of central Helmand Province when the incident took place earlier this month .
His unit had been told that they were seeking a ‘ high value target , ’ a Taliban commander , and that they must prove they had killed the right man .
Deadly : A platoon of Gurkhas demonstrate their skill with their kukri knives in a training exercise , after it is revealed that one of their regiment chopped off the head of a Taliban fighter in order to find proof of ID
The Gurkhas had intended to remove the Taliban leader ’s body from the battlefield for identification purposes .
But they came under heavy fire as their tried to do so .
Military sources said that in the heat of battle , the Gurkha took out his curved kukri knife and beheaded the dead insurgent .
He is understood to have removed the man ’s head from the area , leaving the rest of his body on the battlefield .
This is considered a gross insult to the Muslims of Afghanistan , who bury the entire body of their dead even if parts have to be retrieved .
British soldiers often return missing body parts once a battle has ended so the dead can be buried in one piece .
A source said : ‘ Removing the head in this way was totally inappropriate . ’
Army sources said that the soldier , who is in his early 20s , initially told investigators that he unsheathed his kukri – the symbolic weapon of the Gurkhas – after running out of ammunition .
But later the Taliban fighter was mutilated so his identity could be verified through DNA tests .
The source said : ‘ The soldier has been removed from duty and flown home .
There is no sense of glory involved here , more a sense of shame .
He should not have done what he did . ’
The incident , which is being investigated by senior commanders , is hugely embarrassing to the British Army , which is trying to build bridges with local Afghan communities who have spent decades under ­Taliban rule .
It comes just days after a rogue Afghan soldier murdered three British troops from the same Gurkha regiment .
If the Gurkha being investigated by the Army is found guilty of beheading the dead enemy soldier , he will have contravened the Geneva Conventions which dictate the rules of war .
Soldiers are banned from demeaning their enemies .
The Gurkha now faces disciplinary action and a possible court martial .
If found guilty , he could be jailed .
He is now confined to barracks at the Shorncliffe garrison , near Folkestone , Kent .
The incident happened as the Gurkha troop was advancing towards a hostile area before engaging the enemy in battle .
Colonel Richard Kemp , a former commander of British forces in Afghanistan , said : ‘ In this case , it appears that the ­soldier was not acting maliciously , but his actions were clearly ill - judged .
‘ The Gurkhas are a very fine regiment with a proud tradition of service in the British forces and have fought very bravely in Afghanistan .
' I have no doubt that this behaviour would be as strongly condemned by the other members of that regiment , as it would by all soldiers in the British forces . ’
A Ministry of Defence spokesman said : ‘ We are aware of an incident and have informed the Afghan authorities .
An inves-t­igation is underway and it would not be appropriate to comment further until this is concluded . ’
The Ministry also revealed yesterday that four British servicemen had been killed in Afghanistan in 24 hours .
An airman from the RAF Regiment died in a road accident near Camp Bastion in Helmand and a marine from 40 Commando Royal Marines was killed in an explosion in Sangin on Friday .
A Royal Dragoon Guard died in a blast in the Nahr-e Saraj district of Helmand Province yesterday .
The fourth serviceman also died in an explosion .
The British death toll in the Afghan campaign since 2001 is now 322 .
Afghan troops trained by the British Army recently led a major operation into a Taliban stronghold .
It was one of the first operations organised by the Afghan National Army .
Regiment ’s proud symbol of valour
The iconic kukri knife used by the Gurkhas can be a weapon or a tool .
It is the traditional utility knife of the Nepalese people , but is mainly known as a symbolic weapon for Gurkha regiments all over the world .
The kukri signifies courage and valour on the battlefield and is sometimes worn by bridegrooms during their wedding ceremony .
The kukri’s heavy blade enables the user to inflict deep wounds and to cut muscle and bone with one stroke .
It can also be used in stealth operations to slash an enemy ’s throat , killing him instantly and silently .
QUARANTINE

If it was n’t the best of times , at least it was n’t the worst of times , or something like that , which is the opening line of a novel called A TALE OF TWO CITIES , and it seemed like this would be only a tale of one .
Back in the day before the Quarantine , Manhattan island was the heart and soul and pocketbook of New York City , to the extent that New York could have been said to have all three , Wall Street , Greenwich Village , Broadway and 42nd Street , and all that jazz .
When you saw a movie or a TV show or an ad featuring New York , the Big Apple was Manhattan , not anything in what some visiting Californian must have dubbed the “ Outer Boroughs , ” the moral equivalent of Anaheim or Eagle Rock as far as a Hollywood wise guy was concerned .
Not that I was a Hollywood wise guy just because my sales office happened to be located on the seventh floor of one of those unglamorous glass towers at the busin …
I ’ve had an iPad for a number of weeks now and I find it ’s really helping me organize information better .
With the help of a few select apps I ’ve downloaded I ’m able to connect from anywhere , catch up on videos and reading , and maintain a social media presence .
It was really useful at ALA Annual and I ’ve heard other librarians say great things about their iPads too .
These are a few of the apps that I think are essential for librarians .
iBooks –
This is Apple ’s attempt at doing books and it does a pretty good job .
Like most everything Apple does , they put thought into the user experience and it shows .
The way the pages turn is pretty and you can see your books all on a shelf that you can look through .
The selection in the Apple book store is n’t as good as the Amazon of Barnes and Noble book stores , which also both have apps .
But it is decent and there are a lot of free books you can choose from too .
Cost – Free Stanza – Another great ebook reader .
They have books for purchase but also over 50,000 free titles from places like project Gutenburg .
You can also import ebooks inPDF , ePub , or various other formats .
It gives you a few more options for customization than iBooks does .
Cost – Free Evernote –
An amazing app for note - taking that may make me switch from paper notebooks .
Librarians are often in meetings or have great ideas but forget to bring a notebook or instead bring the wrong one .
With Evernote you can sync notes across devices ( I use it on my Android phone ) and never lose notes .
You can also take voice notes or capture webpages .
This is one of the best tools I ’ve found to capture ideas before they slip away .
Cost – Free Dropbox –
If you have multiple devices ( tablet , desktop , laptop , smartphone ) then this is a must have apps .
Dropbox allows you to sync files across the web and access them from anywhere .
Save a document you were working on at home and read it on the road on your phone .
Then edit it again at home on your laptop .
It is super easy and integrates with a number of other apps too .
Cost – Free up to 2GB of storage , reasonable pricing for more
Twitterific –
We ’re all aware that many librarians are social media butterflies , so a Twitter app is necessary .
Whether you ’re monitoring multiple searches for conference hashtags , chatting with your colleagues , or looking at different lists you ’ve set up , Twitterific does it all well .
It has a clean interface with not too much clutter .
The only downside is that the free version does not support multiple accounts .
So if you need that functionality for your library account too , you might want to look at Osfoora HD for $ 3.99 .
Cost – Free Dictionary.com –
This app is exactly what it sounds like .
Librarians can smith words with the best of them with this handy reference tool .
It has a good interface and includes a thesaurus and word of the day ( which I really like ! )
Cost – Free GoodReader –
It ’s sometimes difficult for librarians to find the time to read scholarly literature .
This is a very useful app for reading all sorts of different documents .
I store Word and PDF files here like articles and reports for reading later when offline .
It ’s a little confusing with all the options for set up and organization , and Jason Griffey noticed that you may want to check your settings for security reasons .
But for saving and reading different files , it is great .
It also integrates with Dropbox !
Cost – $ 0.99 QuickOffice – A productivity app that allows full editing of both Word and Excel documents .
It connects with services like Dropbox or Google Docs to make it easy to find your documents and edit them .
This app turns the iPad into a full fledged office device .
Cost – $ 9.99 Audiobooks –
This app uses the admirable Librivox recording project to make it easy to get over 2,800 classic audiobooks on your iPad .
It automatically bookmarks your last spot and has a built in browser so you can surf the web while listening ( kinda multitasking ) .
Cost – $ 0.99 Wikipanion – Another quick reference app that uses Wikipedia entries and displays them in a visually pleasing format for the iPad .
It cuts down on some of the annoying extras from the Wikipedia site and gives you just content , nice and clean .
Cost – Free
There are 13,000 + iPad apps and growing in the App Store , and this list is by no means comprehensive .
What are some of your favorite apps ?
Did I miss some ?

Some parishioners saw the men being handcuffed by police .
They wondered why one man was face - down on the street outside their church , blood dripping from his face .
The incident outside St. Paul the Apostle Sudanese Episcopal Church , in which Phoenix police officers were accused of falsely arresting and abusing two Sudanese refugees , led to a recent $ 150,000 settlement to avoid a lawsuit .
Attendance at prayer services at the church near Seventh Avenue and Buckeye Road averaged more than 130 people prior to the incident , though word of the altercation " put fear into the community " of refugees , many of whom are now avoiding the neighborhood out of fear of racial profiling and police brutality , the church pastor said .
" The news of that incident , it caused the numbers to go down , " the Rev. Anderia Arok said .
Services now average 60 to 70 people , Arok said .
The two Sudanese men who received the settlement were planning on attending a prayer service inside the church that day in July 2009 , joining other refugees to discuss an international court 's ruling on a regional dispute in their war - torn homeland .
St. Paul the Apostle , which is part of the Episcopal Diocese of Arizona , caters to Sudanese refugees .
An internal police investigation cleared Officers Jason Hammernick and Corey Shibata of any wrongdoing .
City officials said similar settlements are approved to avoid the added expense of defending officers in court .
The notice of claim from the incident outlined how the officers " conspired to falsify " details of the case to justify their probable cause for booking the men on suspicion of resisting arrest and to " avoid being held accountable for their wrongful conduct . "
Hammernick and Shibata told supervisors that they targeted the men as part of a routine traffic stop after running a license plate on a rented Nissan Xterra revealing that the vehicle had been used in a drug case months earlier .
Arok said the incident " looked like a humiliation , " and that many parishioners believed that the escalation from the traffic stop resulted from racial profiling .
He said the men were wearing ties and looked like church members , not anyone connected with illegal drug activity .
" We are not denying there are drugs in the area , but this was in front of the church , " Arok said .
Aluk Bak Deng , 38 , of Tucson , and Angok Atem , 28 , claimed they were aggressively pushed and shoved outside the vehicle , though the officers said the men refused to comply with commands , which led to the physical escalation .
Bak Deng and Atem were with a third man sitting in the rental vehicle as they waited for Arok to open the church for the afternoon prayer service .
Bak Deng , president of the Arizona chapter of the Sudan People 's Liberation Movement , was scheduled to speak at the service .
Perfectionists , by definition , strive for the best , trying to ace exams , be meticulous at their jobs , and raise perfect children .
So one might assume this drive for the ideal translates over to their health as well , with perfectionist being models for physical and mental well - being .
But new research is revealing the trait can bring both profits and perils .
Though perfection is an impossible goal , striving for it can be a boon for one 's health , causing one to stick to exercise programs to a tee , say , or follow a strict regimen for treating chronic illnesses like type 2 diabetes .
But the same lofty goals can mean added mental pressure when mistakes are made and the resistance to asking for help from others in fear of revealing one 's true , imperfect self .
In fact studies show the personality trait of perfectionism is linked to poor physical health and an increased risk of death .
Researchers are just beginning to tease apart this complex trait and its relation to health .
" Perfectionism is a virtue to be extolled definitely , " said Prem Fry , a psychology professor at Trinity Western University in Canada .
" But beyond a certain threshold , it backfires and becomes an impediment , " she said .
[ Related : Perfectionists at Risk for Postpartum Depression ]
Fry and several of her colleagues recently spoke at a symposium on perfectionism and health at the Association for Psychological Science convention in Boston .
What is perfectionism ?
While some might aim to be perfect in certain areas of their life — such as an athlete who must stick to a grueling workout schedule — true perfectionism comes in a generalized form .
" You should want to be perfect across a variety of aspects of your life , " said Gordon Flett , a psychology professor at York University in Canada .
" It 's natural to be perfectionistic in the thing that matters the most , like your job — if you 're a surgeon , there 's no room for error , " Flett said .
" [ But ] you do n’t want that same person to be going home and using those same standards to evaluate family members , which causes stress , " he said .
" It has to generalize . "
Perfectionism tends to have two components : a positive side , including things like setting high standards for themselves ; and a negative side , which involves more deleterious factors , such as having doubts and concerns over mistakes and feeling pressure from others to be perfect .
Some scientists have argued a subset of these high - achievers can be classified as " positive perfectionists , " those who reap the benefits of perfectionism without falling victim to its ills .
However , others say that while perfectionism might seem to be advantageous in certain situations , it always has a dark side that inevitably rears its head .
For instance , a perfectionist might seem fine under normal circumstances , but lose control under stress .
While the existence of " positive perfectionists " is still debated , there 's no doubt the trait can be quite counterproductive in some cases .
" That , in essence is the paradox of perfectionism , that certain people have extraordinarily high standards , but objectively can often look very dysfunctional in terms of their daily functioning , their physical health , their achievement , " said Patricia DiBartolo , a psychology professor at Smith College , in Northampton , Mass .
" They flunk out of college , and the reason why is they 're so perfectionistic they can't actually achieve any goal ; as you begin the process , it 's just impossible . "
Perfectionism and lifespan
Compared with the number of studies looking at perfectionism 's impact on mental health , relatively few have examined the condition 's toll on physical health .
Some earlier work has linked the trait with various ailments , including migraines , chronic pain and asthma .
Fry and her colleagues recently looked at the relationship between perfectionism and overall risk of death .
The study followed 450 adults aged 65 and older for 6.5 years .
The participants completed an initial questionnaire to assess their level of perfectionism and other personality traits .
Those with high perfectionism scores , meaning they placed high expectations on themselves to be perfect , had a 51 - percent increased risk of death compared to those with low scores .
The researchers suspect high levels of stress and anxiety , which are known to be linked with perfectionism , might contribute to the decrease in lifespan .
Next , they reasoned that if perfectionism showed this association in a normal population , it might have an even greater impact on those with a chronic disease , which would put their bodies under even more stress .
But after following 385 patients with type 2 diabetes for 6.5 years , the researchers actually saw the opposite effect .
Those with high perfectionism scores had a 26 - percent lower risk of death than those with low scores .
The results suggest that in certain situations , perfectionism can have advantages .
With type 2 diabetes , scrupulous attention to blood sugar levels and strict adherence to dietary rules can have payoffs in terms of reducing disease severity , the researchers suspect .
" [ Perfectionists ] are very self - critical , they are not satisfied ever with their performance , " Fry said .
" In this particular study on diabetes , those kinds of perfectionistic attitudes , normally we would regard them to be dysfunctional attitudes , but in the case of the diabetic sample , they turned out to be very positive traits , " she said .
" These individuals were highly self - critical , they worked harder than the average person to adhere to the instructions of the physician or the attending doctor in staying with all the do's and dont's of diabetic diet constraints . "
" So they ended up taking better care of themselves through self - management than people who were sort of more easygoing and lax , " she said .
Who expects perfection ?
Some studies suggest the role of perfectionism on health might depend on who ’s imposing the high standards .
In 2006 , Danielle Molnar , of Brock University in Canada , examined the perfectionism - health link in nearly 500 Canadian adults between the ages of 24 and 35 .
The study assessed participants for three different dimensions of perfectionism : self - oriented perfectionism , in which individuals impose high standards on themselves ; socially prescribed perfectionism , where individuals feel others expect them to be perfect ; and other - oriented , in which individuals place high standards on others .
People experience these perfectionist traits to varying degrees .
One person might score high on all three , or they might fall into one extreme or another such as self - oriented perfectionism .
The researchers found socially prescribed perfectionism was associated with poorer physical health , which in this case meant individuals experienced more symptoms of health problems , had more doctors visits , took more days off work , and gave themselves low scores when asked to rate their health .
On the other hand , self - oriented perfectionism was associated with better physical health .
So what ’s behind this relationship ?
One factor could be the degree to which people feel happy or sad , known in psychology as positive or negative affect .
The 2006 paper showed general negative feelings , including feeling anxious and upset , could partially explain the relationship they saw between socially prescribed perfectionism and poorer health .
And feelings of happiness explained self - oriented perfection 's link with better health .
However , the pathway that connects perfectionism to health is likely more complex .
For instance , in more recent research , Molnar found self - imposed perfectionism conferred pros and cons with regard to health that canceled each other out .
" On one hand it was related to higher levels of stress in students , which was related to lower levels of health , " Molnar said .
" On the other hand it had a protective factor , because it was also related to lower levels of high risk behavior , " which includes things such as smoking and drinking .
" You really have to look at the mechanism , not just looking at how perfectionism is directly related to health , but what pathways link it to health ? "
Molnar said .
" Unless you look at the mechanism , a lot of the time [ the effect ] washes itself out because it will have opposing relationships . "
Other factors
Those who feel others expect them to be perfect might also experience declines in health as a result of distancing themselves from other people , and any support from friends and family .
" We know social support is a huge indicator of physical health .
If you tend to have strong bonds with people , good family life , good friendships , you tend to be healthier , " Molnar said .
" And we know socially prescribed perfectionists , they tend to have this sense of disconnection with other people , so it would make sense that one of the ways they would experience poorer health is because of this sense of social disconnection from others . "
Even if others reach out to help , socially prescribed perfectionists may view the kind actions as critical .
" Even when the levels of received support , so the support they 're actually getting , is the same , there 's been some work showing that perfectionists will actually appraise it differently , " Molnar said .
" They do n’t see it as nurturing and supportive , but that people are being critical of them , and they 're interfering , they 're perceiving that people are n’t there for them , " she said .
Other perfectionists might hold off on asking for help altogether , because they do n't want to let on that there 's anything wrong , or that they 're imperfect in some way .
" If you have to ask someone for help , well that means you 're flawed , that means you 're weak , right ?
And so I think there 's also that presentation of not wanting to seem like you need help from others , " said Fuschia Sirois , of the University of Windsor in Canada .
Poor health could also be the result of perfectionists leaving little time to care for themselves , while spending every minute striving for perfection , Sirois said .
Future work
More work is needed to untangle the intricate relationship between perfectionism and health .
For instance , few studies have examined perfectionism in older adults , which might be due to the incorrect notion that perfectionism eases with age , Fry said .
" We 've gone along with the misconception that if people are perfectionistic in their earlier stages of life , that in late life their perfectionism sort of automatically tapers off , but it does n’t tapper off , " she said .
Perfectionism in the elderly is of particular concern because , although they still have the same high expectations , they are unable to perform as well , which could ultimately lead to greater depression and anxiety , Fry said .
Researchers should also focus on understanding exactly why perfectionism is associated with poorer health or better health , depending on the situation .
" Without knowing the whys we can't intervene , we can't help these people , " Molnar said .
" These people are walking around with incredibly unrealistic expectations … they 're not just striving for excellence , they 're striving for absolute perfection , which of course is impossible .
So they 're setting themselves up for more failure experiences , " she said .
" We have to start understanding what 's going on in the middle so how can we help these people . "
TORONTO ( Reuters ) - Russian President Dmitry Medvedev said Sunday he was alarmed by U.S. assertions that Iran may have enough fuel for two nuclear weapons and warned that if confirmed the Islamic Republic may face new measures .

Central Intelligence Agency Director Leon Panetta told ABC ’s “ This Week ” television program that the agency thinks Iran has enough low - enriched uranium now for two weapons , but that Tehran would have to further enrich the material first .
“ As to this information -- it needs to be checked , ” Medvedev told reporters in Toronto , where he was attending the Group of 20 summit of rich and emerging nations .
“ In any case , such information is always alarming because today the international community does not recognize the Iranian nuclear program as transparent , ” Medvedev said .
Russian leaders rarely comment on CIA statements and Medvedev ’s sharp comments indicate the gulf that has grown between Moscow and Tehran over recent months .
The Kremlin and Tehran had a public row last month after Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad admonished the Kremlin for bowing to what he said was U.S. pressure to agree further sanctions .
Urged on by the Obama administration , the U.N. Security Council -- which includes Russia -- this month passed a resolution to impose new sanctions on Iran over its nuclear development .
“ If it is shown that what the American special services say is true then it will of course make the situation more tense , and I do not exclude that this question would have to be looked at additionally , ” Medvedev said .
The United States , key European Union powers and Israel say Iran is trying to use its civilian nuclear program to hide an attempt to create an atomic bomb , an assertion Tehran denies .
Russia has repeatedly called on Iran to remove the doubts that the international community have and earlier this year one of Russia ’s top security officials said that Western concerns were valid .
The CIA said that for Iran to have enough nuclear material for bombs , it would have to enrich its low - enriched uranium .
“ We would estimate that if they made that decision , it would probably take a year to get there , probably another year to develop the kind of weapons delivery system in order to make that viable , ” CIA chief Panetta said .

Image caption Niger is one of the world 's poorest countries
Two major aid agencies have launched $ 10 m ( £ 6.7 m ) appeals for drought - stricken Niger in West Africa .
About seven million people - half of the country 's population - face food shortages after crop failures last year .
Aid organisations Oxfam and Save The Children say the situation is growing more critical by the day .
Their concern is shared by the UN , which says the crisis is of a magnitude not seen before .
Save the Children says 400,000 children under five are at risk of starvation .
Oxfam says it will focus help towards a further two million adults who are facing severe food shortages .
The crisis , in the world 's most under - developed nation , has been caused by a combination of a crop failure - following a drought last year - along with big increases in the price of many staple foods .
The magnitude of this crisis has not been seen before Khardiata Lo Ndiaye , UN Niger director
The UN's country director , Khardiata Lo Ndiaye , says the emergency is already worse than the drought in 2005 , and says that help is needed quickly .
" The magnitude of this crisis has not been seen before .
We need money now ! " she said .
The UN currently only has just over half the funds it has appealed for to support the population until the next harvest , which is due in September .
Even Israel ’s unconscionable treatment of the inhabitants of Gaza pales in significance to the question Ms. Thomas 's remarks should have triggered in our collective imagination .
And it is this : where exactly are the Israeli Jews , whom Ms. Thomas admonished to " get the hell out of Palestine " supposed to go ?
I ’m not referring to the wealthy Israeli elites or the nuclear physicists , or even the growing numbers of middle class citizens of the Jewish State possessing second passports to western countries , according to a 2008 report of the Jerusalem - based Menachem Begin Heritage Center .
I ’m talking about all the rest .
And this brings me to the main point I wish to make .
Would six million innocent souls have died in the Holocaust had the United States and Western Europe opened their borders to German Jews , fleeing Nazi persecution on the eve of World War II ?
This may be ancient history to some and water under the bridge to others .
But , lest we forget , Adolph Hitler referred to the Holocaust as " the final solution " because no other nation would take in the Jews and the Nazi leader ’s scheme for resettling them in Madagascar had come to naught .
In 1939 , the United States refused to allow the MS St. Louis , carrying 900 German Jews fleeing the Nazis to land on American soil .
The ship was forced to return to Hamburg , Germany , where many of the passengers perished in the Holocaust .
A survey taken in January of 1939 revealed that 83 percent of the American public opposed a bill in Congress that would have allowed European Jewish refugees to enter the country .
According to Professor Theodore S. Hamerow , the view taken by the U.S. public was that : " Jews were not like most Americans , real Americans . " [ Hamerow , Why we Watched : Europe , America and the Holocaust , 2008 , p.xiv ]
Even efforts to admit orphaned Jewish children failed .
After World War II , the western world learned to its horror that 67 percent of world Jewry had perished in Nazi gas chambers .
And yet , the best these nations could offer the Holocaust ’s traumatized survivors was passage to a former British colony in the Middle East , populated by enraged Arabs .
The conflict between the Jews and Arabs in Palestine had , after all , not exploded onto the world scene in 1948 .
Throughout the early decades of the twentieth century , Zionist efforts to resettle small groups of Jews in Palestine , had been met with rioting , massacres and open warfare on the part of Arabs fearful of losing control of their homeland .
It may be true as recent scholarly accounts suggest , that after World War II , the Zionists inflated the numbers of Jewish refugees in the displaced persons camps , who wished to relocate to war - torn Palestine .
It is useful to give weight to the observations of Ernest Morris , a Jewish attorney and friend of the late President Roosevelt , who reported back to the White House after visiting the Jewish refugee camps :
" What if Canada , Australia , South America , England and the United States were all to open a door to some migration ?
Even today [ written in 1947 ] it is my judgement , and I have been in Germany since the war , that only a minority of the Jewish DP ’s [ displaced persons ] would choose Palestine . "
[ Israel in the Mind of America , by Peter Grose , 1983 , p.196 ]
Anybody in his or her right ( read - unbigoted ) mind at the time , would have surmised that the emotionally - traumatized Holocaust survivors , many of whom were not religious Jews , would have preferred to resettle in Europe or America .
However , they were not given that option .
While repudiating the anti-Semitic lunacy of the Nazis , the West hid its own anti-Jewish prejudices under Zionism ’s skirts .
Since Israel ’s founding in 1948 , the Jewish State has fought seven wars , numerous armed conflicts , endured suicide bombings and countless terrorist attacks from its Arab enemies .
Were the Jewish state , hypothetically - speaking , to collapse twenty years from now under the combined weight of emotional exhaustion , demographic realities , and perpetual warfare would the United States and Europe open their borders and fragile labor markets to millions of educated , well - trained , hardworking Jewish refugees ?
History has a diabolical way of repeating itself , if only to test whether the human species is capable of learning any lessons at all .
Who knows ?
Maybe that ’s what Helen Thomas was getting at .
Articles : Quit quirks when working with others 2010 - 07-07
When I travel , I like to stay at little independent hotels .
One time , I checked - in to a new hotel late at night , and loved the design of the lobby .
Very modern and cool .
Nice person at the front desk , too .
But once inside my room , I could n’t find the light switch !
We all know where it ’s supposed to be : on the wall , next to the door , a little switch you can feel in the dark .
Every place does it like that .
I felt blindly around all the walls near the door , but no switch !
I gave up and went back to the front desk , and told them I could n’t figure out how to turn on the lights .
They said , “ Ah , sorry .
We get that question every time .
Our rooms have no switches .
Just feel for a smooth panel on the wall by the door .
Slide your hand from left to right across it , to turn on all power in the room .
To turn the power off again , slide your hand from right to left . ”
Grrrr ....
I went back , did it their way , and it worked .
I went to the sink to wash my hands .
The faucet had no handles .
I could n’t figure out how to turn it on .
Eventually I figured out I had to pull down on the faucet itself , and twist it to change the temperature .
Grrr ....
The alarm clock only had one button .
Oh , whatever .
I did n’t even try .
I slept well but checked out the next day , and switched to a hotel down the street .
It also had simple minimalist design , but this time everything did what I expected , and I was full of new appreciation for standards and usability .
Artist mentality
If you ’ve ever taken an art class , you can understand the hotel designer ’s radically creative mentality .
“ We are going to create a totally different experience , unlike anything else !
This will be my unique vision of how we interact with our surroundings .
This is better than the boring typical thing that everyone else does . ”
I usually love that attitude !
Yes , challenge norms !
Give us bold new ideas , and make me look at the world in a new way !
I love radical design , modern architecture , and avant - garde music .
It seems I ’d be the perfect person to appreciate this hotel room .
So what was it that bothered me about that experience ?
Was I just not in the mood ?
Then I figured out the difference , and it ’s changed how I think of working with others :
I was forced to use it .
If a company sells something with a radically new design , and you try it and like it , you can choose to use it , and love it .
You ’re not forced to use it .
In the case of a hotel room , I had already reserved the room , planned my trip , and checked in before realizing they were going to force me to use their unique non-standard interface .
For you website designers : your design choices are like this light switch .
Your users have already come to your site , now they ’re forced to use your interface .
Rarely use it ?
Imagine you got a job at a new company that forced you to use a radically different computer that took a while to learn , but was much more productive after a few days of getting used to it .
In that case , being non-standard is OK .
Even though you were forced , you had time to get to know it , and might eventually love it .
But most people only stay at a hotel for one or two nights .
Everybody is a new user .
It was pretentious for the designer to think I was going to forget everything I know and learn a whole new way of interacting with the world , just to sleep at a hotel for a night .
So this is just like my favorite web usability law : “ users spend most of their time on other websites ”
The best design should do what people expect , and should not make them think .
So the best design strategy is to do what others do .
That was a really hard lesson for me to learn .
It takes a lot of maturity to let go of that wild ego expression , when you ’ve spent your life in the creative artist mindset .
Quitting quirks when working with others
Then I started thinking about other aspects in life where this applies .
How many times have I insisted the people I work with do everything my unique and quirky way ?
The contractors and employees must have felt like I did with the light switch in the hotel .
Realizing how inconsiderate this is , I ’ve dropped my quirks when working with others .
I ’ll keep them private .
When making websites all by myself , I have a very quirky self - made framework I like to use .
It works great for me .
But to make every programmer I hire work with my quirks would be inconsiderate .
So I ’m sticking with standards .
It ’s funny what you can learn from a light switch .
TEHRAN ( Reuters ) -
The latest sanctions against Iran are pathetic , President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said on Saturday , warning world powers they would regret their bullying .

In his first speech since U.S. President Barack Obama signed into law sanctions targeting Iran ’s vulnerable fuel imports , Ahmadinejad said the measures would not hurt the economy or stop Iran taking a greater role in world affairs .
“ They know that there is a sleeping lion in Iran which is waking up and if she wakes up all the relationships in the world will change , ” he told industrialists .
“ Their pathetic acts show they know what a great human power is hidden in Iran . ”
The U.S. law followed sanctions agreed by the U.N. Security Council and the European Union , all aimed at pressuring Tehran to curb a nuclear program some countries fear is aimed at making a bomb -- something Iran denies .
“ They thought that by having meetings and talking to each other and signing papers they could stop a great nation ’s progress , ” Ahmadinejad said .
“ Iran is much greater than what they can perceive it in their small minds , ” he added .
“ We know that if this Iranian civilization awakes then there would be no more room for arrogant , corrupt and bullying powers . ”
The hardline Iranian leader has consistently played down the impact of sanctions .
He called the U.N. resolution a “ used handkerchief ” and said that Iran could become self - sufficient in gasoline within one week if needed -- more likely a rhetorical flourish than a realistic assessment of its energy needs .
Last week , France ’s Total joined a list of oil companies that do not sell gasoline to Iran which , despite being the world ’s fifth - largest oil producer , lacks sufficient refining capacity and imports up to 40 percent of its petrol .
Two days ago , South Korea ’s GS Engineering & Construction called off a $ 1.2 billion contract to sweeten gas from the South Pars field .
This one of the world ’s biggest gas fields , but Iran has yet to exploit it fully , partly because sanctions have limited foreign investment and knowhow .
Ahmadinejad has said he is prepared to return to talks with major powers on the nuclear question , but on certain conditions only , and not before the end of August -- a delay he said was intended to “ punish ” the West .
EU foreign affairs chief Catherine Ashton , with the backing of the major powers that have been involved in nuclear talks with Iran in the past , wrote to Tehran ’s chief nuclear negotiator last month inviting him to resume negotiations .
Taxpayer asks :
Hi tax girl !
So I ’ve heard a pretty believable rumor that the tax preparer I ’ve used for four years has been federally indicted for tax fraud .
I ’m not sure if it was her own tax return or the people she worked with , though I do know of a few people who used her that have been audited and ended up owing .
I ’m asking three things :
Will all of her clients ( past and present ) be audited ?
Basically , does this automatically mean I should be looking for a letter from the IRS in the near future ?
Three of the four years I used her , she was working for a nationally - reputable tax preparation company and each year I signed up for their preparer assurance policy ( insuring mistakes / discrepancies up to a certain dollar amount ) .
Will / should this be upheld in these circumstances ?
In hindsight , I have reasonable suspicion about some deductions that were claimed on my returns .
What is my best recourse here ?
Should I consult the tax preparation company preemptively regarding my suspicions , or just wait for the letter in the mail to arrive ?
Address next tax season with my new preparer ?
Any advice / insight you could give would be greatly appreciated !
– A concerned taxpayer
Taxgirl says :
I could see where that might give you some cause for concern .
So much of this is going to rely on the actual facts and circumstances of this case so be prepared for a lot of “ it depends ” …
If , in fact , your tax preparer is indicted for tax fraud and it ’s restricted to her own tax return , I ca n’t imagine that the feds would target her client returns .
Those are totally separate issues .
If your tax preparer is indicted for tax fraud with respect to returns that she prepared , the scale of any subsequent audits would depend on the nature of her fraud .
If it were a fake refund scheme or a 1099 - OID scheme , for example , the IRS might flag returns that involve those specific matters .
However , a sweeping audit of her client returns would seem extraordinary without an understanding of the number of returns and the nature of the fraud .
It ’s also important to keep in mind that the Criminal Investigative Division of the IRS is separate from the audit division though there ’s no question that they would share information where appropriate .
With respect to any kind of insurance or audit protection that you might have signed up for , the answer would depend on the specific contract .
If I had to guess , fraud would not be covered under the policy and there are probably exceptions that apply when their representatives act outside of the scope of their employment .
But read the fine print : that ’s what it ’s there for .
So , all of that said , here ’s where I can give you an answer that does n’t involve the words “ it depends . ”
If you ’re concerned about your previously filed returns , have a reputable tax professional review the returns and give you some feedback .
If you already have doubts about the veracity of the returns , it ’s best to nip it in the bud now .
Absolutely be proactive : it ’s rarely a good idea to wait for the IRS to come to you .
Good luck !
Before you go : be sure to read my disclaimer .
Remember , I ’m a lawyer and we love disclaimers .
If you have a question , here ’s how to Ask The Taxgirl .
It does n’t matter if they are selling paper or pixels .
Every salesperson says the same thing .
Personally , I have heard it many times and now I am hearing it from other people too .
They all say prices are too high .
It ’s their knee jerk response to new work .
This conversation kicks in when the people selling the work get their hands on the estimate for doing the work .
Sales or account service then call a meeting to discuss , but what they are really doing is challenging the estimate because they feel the cost is too high .
That ’s if you ’re lucky .
Sometimes they adjust the numbers on their own .
From an earlier post you may be familiar with this story , but I did n’t fully disclose how bad the circumstances were .
My team was about halfway through a small phase of a large project that had a solid estimate in place .
Out of the blue , account service started freaking out .
At a status meeting we were being called out for causing the project to run over budget .
We should n’t have been anywhere close .
After some investigation it was learned sales and account service adjusted our estimate without telling us .
Only because they had the audacity to point fingers did we find out .
The sad thing is it was just one of many times the estimate was adjusted .
Later on we discovered our agency had billed around $ 600,000 for over $ 1,000,000 of work .
The girl that made the mistake of calling us out was let go .
Her boss who actually made the adjustment remains employed .
What happens to a client that gets free work ?
They expect free work .
One of the first rules of negotiating is to never give something up without getting something in return .
The client asked and we gave .
We took nothing in return and so that ’s what we ended up with .
After that agency tried to fix the error of their ways and enforce some level of profitability , the client pulled the project and handed it off to their internal IT team .
I am sure that turned out to be a rude awakening for the client , but for that agency , it was long drawn out process that cost $ 400,000 and made enemies out of its coworkers .
A salesperson ’s job is to show value .
If they ca n’t do that one thing , I do n’t know what purpose they serve .
Stroll into any automotive showroom and a salesperson will start walking you through the features of the car you ’re interested in .
It ’s preemptive price justification .
Infomercials do a good job at this as well .
Regardless if the customer is paying just $ 19.95 or an affordable $ 19,500.00 , there is healthy amount of value statements and enthusiasm built into the pitch .
I respect good salesmen .
They take the time to understand the work they are selling .
They know the product inside and out .
They understand exactly how it will benefit their clients and how to go about communicating that .
Certainly , they know a pitch has to be informative and entertaining .
It ’s the art of showing value .
When salesmen are bad it sometimes comes from laziness , but other times it is gullibility or the lack of a backbone .
I have had enough client interaction to know how they can push .
You learn anything not in writing does n’t exist .
If you ’ve been in business long enough , client requests go something like this .
If you do this for me now , I will give you more work later .
Or , this project will get you great exposure .
Well , the promise of exposure is not worth a check in the bank .
The promise for more work later on is fine if they want to sign a contract .
If they do n’t put it in writing , we call that a lie despite it being intentional or not .
I can think of a client I also knew personally .
I used to do software development for him .
No matter what he was doing , he was negotiating price .
Always looking for an angle on how to get something for free , did n’t matter if it was fundamentally unethical .
The way he saw it , if you could exploit the system , there was a problem with the system .
He was just being smart .
He may not have been honest all the time , but he certainly was n’t breaking any laws .
So yes , clients push to get the best prices for products and services , big surprise .
Sometimes they cross a line .
Sometimes they do n’t .
Like any relationships , they might just keep pushing to see how far they can take it .
If you do n’t know how to effectively stand your ground , you ’ll get bullied .
There are a lot of industries that wrestle with this .
Advertising agencies are often asked to develop ideas first to see if clients want to buy .
Could there be a worse way to do business ?
Your agency spends weeks on a pitch competing against four or more other agencies .
The company you ’re doing work for reviews all the pitches to select one agency that gets paid .
Hundreds of thousands of dollars in resources are just wasted if you do n’t get the win .
It ’s just another way giving away free work can be financially devastating .
We all do things at times without direct compensation .
We invest thousands at college in hopes of landing a job that is more financially fit than flipping burgers .
Maybe it ’s a personal relationship that has you doing favors for someone who will return them at a later date .
Too often in business though , someone tries to confuse indirect compensation with what they are really offering , which is nothing .
If you have a set bill rate and there is a set amount of time the work will take , accepting anything less is just giving it away .
When offered less money , offer less work .
If the sales team has a problem , you need to put your foot down .
The client has a problem ?
Now , it ’s a negotiation .
Once forced to accept a concession , call it out and get something in return .
Regardless of the situation never sell your work for free .
I will leave you with a video that sums up the experience well :
Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer ( R ) signed a controversial law this week targeting ethnic studies classes in public schools .
In the wake of international reaction to the state ’s illegal - immigration law , Arizona is once again roiling the Latino community and stirring up issues of racial identity , national pride , and respect .
The new law threatens to withhold 10 percent of state funding from any school district or charter school that offers classes that are designed for one particular group , “ advocate ethnic solidarity , ” “ promote resentment of a race or class of people , ” or “ promote the overthrow of the United States government . ”
Arizona ’s superintendent of public instruction Tom Horne sees the law as a victory in a two - year quest against classes in Tucson schools that he believes cause Latino students to resent whites .
The law “ is consistent with the fundamental American value that we are all individuals , not exemplars of whatever ethnic groups we were born into , ” he noted in a statement last month when legislators passed the law .
“ Ethnic studies programs teach the opposite , and are designed to promote ethnic chauvinism . ”
Tucson Unified School District acting superintendent Maggie Shafer says the classes , offered by the Mexican American Studies Department , will continue and “ are in full compliance with the law . ”
The classes are open to all students and include non-Hispanics , she says .
The Tucson district is 56 percent Hispanic .
“ If kids come together and they feel some sense of brotherhood from sharing a class and studying about history and possibly previous oppression , well , that ’s a byproduct of the course ; we ’re not teaching solidarity . ”
In an open letter to the Tucson community in 2007 , Mr. Horne cited passages in several textbooks as inflammatory , and said a teacher had complained of a separatist political agenda prevailing in such classes .
Ms. Shafer says
Horne has not visited any of the classes himself .
The law takes effect next January , and if the state superintendent or school board says Tucson schools are out of compliance , “ I would imagine there would be a legal challenge , ” Shafer says .
The law could be challenged on a First Amendment basis for being too broad and vague in its references to solidarity and resentment , says Ruthann Robson , a professor at the City University of New York School of Law .
“ The biggest problem is the chilling effect , ” she says , noting that teachers or school leaders in Arizona might end or modify legitimate classes out of fear of losing funding .
A group of United Nations human rights experts expressed concern earlier this week about both the immigration and ethnic studies laws in Arizona .
“ Everyone has the right to seek and develop cultural knowledge and to know and understand his or her own culture ... , ” they said .
Hunger - strikers at the University of California at Berkeley recently included among their demands that the campus preserve its commitment to ethnic studies in light of what they considered an attack on such courses in the Arizona law .
The group ended their strike Wednesday after a meeting with administrators produced “ modest agreements . ”

Israel is expected to reject calls from the United Nations and others for an international investigation of its deadly raid on a Gaza - bound aid flotilla .
Israelis stage a protest on Monday outside Turkey 's embassy in Tel Aviv against Turkey 's support for the Gaza - bound ships .
( ( Ronen Zvulun / Reuters ) )
At least nine people were killed when six ships trying to break the three - year blockade of Gaza were raided by Israeli commandos early Monday .
Israel says the commandos used force only after activists on board a Turkish flagship attacked them .
Nine of the activists were killed .
Turkey , an unofficial backer of the flotilla , has accused Israel of committing a " bloody massacre " against civilians delivering humanitarian aid .
The UN's assistant secretary general , Oscar Fernandez - Taranco , said Monday in his briefing to the Security Council that the bloodshed would have been avoided " if repeated calls on Israel to end the counterproductive and unacceptable blockade of Gaza had been heeded . "
Israel 's military is already investigating the raid .
An official in the prime minister 's office said there is " no case in recent history " where a democratic country 's army involved in the deaths of civilians in an overseas operation has been subjected to an international investigation .
The government is expected to announce its refusal formally later in the day .
The raid prompted international criticism and fresh calls to lift the blockade of Gaza , although the details of what happened during the military raid are still not entirely clear .
Canadian Farooq
Burney was on board the ship that was attacked .
He said the Israeli navy approached the boat at dawn on Monday and threw a smoke bomb onto it .
The smoke bomb exploded , causing people to yell and scream , he said .
Then commandos descended from a helicopter above and boarded the boat .
" When the commandos came in , the people on the boat started spraying them with water because they did not want them to get on the ship , " Burney told CBC News .
" And when the people in the helicopter came , they obviously had guns with them and they were , you could say were ready for action , and at that point [ it ] turned to hand - to - hand combat . "
New flotilla underway
Pro-Palestinian activists say they are organizing a new flotilla to try to break Israel 's blockade of Gaza in early fall .

And an Irish - owned cargo ship is already steaming toward Gaza , expected to arrive as early as this weekend .
The MV Rachel Corrie is believed to be carrying 11 passengers , a much smaller contingent than the 700 activists believed to have been on Monday 's flotilla .
It is carrying 1,000 tonnes of aid , the Belfast Telegraph reported Thursday .
Israel insists it , too , will be stopped .
The 10,000 tonnes of aid from the original flotilla , organized by the Free Gaza movement , remains stuck at the Israel - Gaza border .
Israel had been keen to show it would let the aid in as promised .
But a Hamas government minister said the aid would not be let through until all of the protesters on board the flotilla are released from custody without exception .
Israel has deported 527 activists from countries including Greece and Turkey .
Activists from Australia , Ireland and Italy remain in custody , as do a number of Israel citizens who had been on board the ships .
Free Gaza Movement spokeswoman Greta Berlin said her group is working with the European Campaign to End the Siege to send at least three aid ships to Gaza in September or October .
Turkish Islamic charity IHH is welcome to join the flotilla , despite Israel 's allegation the group has terror ties , she said .
# 65 Teleportation Sucks
It makes me wonder what cool stuff we 've missed out on because of the cool stuff we have now .
The library system of the University of California may call upon the schools ' faculty to boycott journals originating from the Nature Publishing Group if they can't come to an agreement on licensing costs for journal access .
The libraries are being hammered by budget cuts resulting from California 's deteriorating state budget situation , and have already alerted content providers that it would need to work out flexible licensing arrangements in order to maintain journal access for their faculty and students .
NPG has apparently chosen not to heed that request , raising the potential for a showdown .
The UC system includes campuses at Berkeley , Davis , San Francisco , Merced , Santa Cruz , Santa Barbara , Los Angeles , Irvine , Riverside , and San Diego .
Many of these are considered among the finest research institutions in the world ( if , as a graduate of Berkeley , I do say so myself ) .
As state - supported schools , however , these institutions are also at the mercy of the vagaries of the state budget , which has been subject to various crises over the past few decades .
In the past , that has resulted in increased tuition fees , faculty hiring freezes , and , most relevant , major cutbacks in the libraries ' budget .
According to an open letter to its faculty , a number of price reductions have been negotiated with other content providers , allowing the libraries to eliminate $ 1 million from its budget .
That may not be nearly enough ; the UC system apparently faces a cut of nearly half a billion dollars , a drop of over 15 percent in what it receives from the state annually .
All of the million of dollars it has saved would apparently need to go to NPG to maintain access to its journals ; the libraries claim that it 's requesting a 400 percent increase from the current rates .
In response to the brewing crisis , a Vice Dean at UCSF , Keith Yamamoto , is apparently looking into organizing a boycott of NPG publications by UC faculty .
According to numbers compiled by the libraries , this threat carries considerable weight .
Over the past six years , UC faculty members have published over 5,000 articles in NPG journals , which have produced $ 19 million in revenue for the company .
The boycott would go well beyond publications , however , as UC faculty members have also served as editors and peer reviewers for the journals — the latter service performed for free .
Obviously , there 's a tradeoff for faculty , in that many of the NPG journals are recognized for their high quality , and provide a level of prestige that may be essential for advancing a researcher 's career .
The libraries recommend alternatives , such as the Public Library of Science journals , but those have yet to reach an equivalent level of recognition .
The letter also recommends other open access policies , such as following the NIH open access guidelines , but NPG has already taken actions to support these policies .
In essence , the situation may become a high - stakes bet .
The UC faculty would be gambling that the boycott would n't be fragmented by researchers tempted to publish in NPG journals ; NPG would be betting that the boycott would n't drive up the prominence of competing journals , such as those from PLoS .
At this point , it 's difficult to lay odds on either of those outcomes .
Nature 's take
In response to our query , Nature Publishing group provided us with a public statement in which it voices distress that what it had assumed were ongoing , confidential negotiations have been disclosed to the public .
As for the assertions made along with the disclosure , NPG thinks they 're misleading .
" The implication that NPG is increasing its list prices by massive amounts is entirely untrue , " the statement reads .
According to Nature , its library subscriptions are currently capped at seven percent annually .
Where did the massive increase mentioned by the UC libraries come from ?
The statement argues that the price increase seems dramatic simply because UC was operating under a discount that NPG terms " unsustainable . "
NPG claims that it 's providing the UC libraries with a discount from list of close to 90 percent , and that " other subscribers , both in the US and around the world , are subsidizing them . "
Even with the new pricing in place , NPG estimates that the average download of a paper would only cost UC a bit more than 50¢ .
NPG seems convinced that cooler heads and a detailed analysis of the numbers will see the UC libraries return to the negotiating table .
" We are confident that the appointment of Professor Keith Yamamoto and other scientific faculty to lead the proposed boycott , " it states , " will mean they will be in a position to assess value with a rigorous and transparent methodology . "
Open Letter To Congress On Commercial Space
Status Report From :
Posted : Tuesday , June 22 , 2010
Dear Members of Congress :
We , the undersigned space leaders , are strong supporters of human spaceflight .
We are writing to urge you to both ( 1 ) fully fund the commercial crew to Space Station program proposed in the President 's FY2011 budget request for NASA , and ( 2 ) accelerate the pace and funding of NASA 's human space exploration projects beyond Earth orbit .
These twin pillars of human spaceflight are each crucial to the long - term health of our Nation 's space program .
They are also interdependent .
And they will together generate thousands of high tech U.S. jobs for people in multiple states , including Florida , Alabama , Texas , California , Nevada , Virginia , Colorado , New Mexico , and Maryland .
Among us are over 50 space leaders -- former NASA executives and advisors , former astronauts , CEOs of firms large and small , a former FAA Associate Administrator , space scientists , space journalists , and others .
We are a diverse group , but we are only a handful of the Nation 's citizens who support U.S. leadership in human space flight in general , and the development of commercial human spaceflight in particular .
We specifically wish to express our concern that the commercial crew to Space Station program is sometimes seen as optional or too risky to America 's future in space , but nothing could be further from the truth .
In fact , the commercial crew to Space Station program is a fundamental enabler of NASA 's human space exploration beyond Earth orbit , specifically because it will free up the NASA dollars needed to develop deep space transportation and exploration systems for astronauts .
Moreover , a commercial crew to Station transportation system , involving multiple separate space lines as the President has proposed , is more robust than a single - legged transportation plan , whether domestic or foreign .
For these reasons and others , we fully and enthusiastically support both full funding for the commercial crew to Space Station program and also the acceleration of exploration beyond Earth orbit , as the top two priorities within NASA 's human spaceflight budget .
Together , these two efforts will also :
Provide an affordable and fast way to close the current post - Shuttle gap in indigenous U.S. human orbital spaceflight capability , by using launch vehicles that already exist .
Provide a safe and robust future transportation network to low Earth orbit and beyond for U.S. astronauts .
Ensure that our dependence on foreign human launch capabilities is reduced quickly and economically .
Reduce space access costs and enhance our national security industrial base .
Allow NASA to better focus on accelerating space exploration and the development of its enabling technologies .
Excite young Americans to careers in science , engineering , and technology .
Stimulate the private sector economy and the development of space commerce over in a dramatic way , by catalyzing other U.S. space interests such as space tourism and the operation of private in - space research facilities .
Excite entrepreneurs to envision and then give birth to new commercial services and capabilities in space , further stimulating the Nation 's economy .
Others have said that one of the greatest fears of any generation is not leaving things better for the young people of the next generation .
We agree with this .
Therefore we reiterate that the near term development of commercial human spaceflight and a clearly defined program of human exploration beyond Earth orbit are both essential .
Without either , our Nation 's leadership in space will significantly suffer .
We urge you to make these two goals your highest priorities within NASA 's FY2011 budget for human spaceflight .

Police are on high alert across Pakistan after a deadly suicide attack on a Sufi Islamic shrine in the eastern city of Lahore .
Security has been increased in Lahore and at Sufi shrines across the country , after 42 people died at the Data Darbar shrine on Thursday .
Protesters have demonstrated outside the shrine , in anger at what they say were lax security measures .
Wider demonstrations were expected for later in the day , after Friday prayers .
Analysis
No group has yet said that it carried out the attack , but the finger of blame is being pointed at the Taliban .
The type of target , a Muslim shrine , is unusual .
There are some elements among Islamist extremists , including the Taliban , who believe that worshipping at the shrines of saints is un-Islamic , and this is one theory why this shrine was attacked .
There was another sectarian attack just over a month ago in Lahore in which 80 people died , when two mosques used by Ahmadi Muslims were hit by militants .
This could be a battle within a battle that the militants are having with the Pakistani state .
The popular shrine holds the remains of a Persian Sufi saint , Abul Hassan Ali Hajvery .
It is visited by hundreds of thousands of people each year from both Sunni and Shia traditions of Islam .
The impact of the two blasts ripped open the courtyard of the shrine .
Rescuers had to clamber over rubble as they carried out the victims .
The first attacker struck in the underground area where visitors sleep and prepare themselves for prayer , officials said .
As people fled , a second bomber detonated his explosives in the upstairs area .
The bombers are thought to have used devices packed with ball - bearings to maximise the impact of their attack .
A volunteer security guard at the shrine described scenes of devastation .
" It was a horrible scene , " said Mohammed Nasir .
" There were dead bodies all around with blood and people were crying . "
The attack is the biggest on a Sufi shrine in Pakistan since militant attacks began in 2001 .
" Those who still pretend that we are not a nation at war are complicit in these deaths , " said Farahnaz Ispahani , a spokeswoman for President Asif Ali Zardari .
No group has said it carried out the attack , but correspondents say the attacks continue a growing trend among militants to target members of other sects as well as minorities .
The attack may also feed the pervading anti-American sentiment , a sense that US interference in the region is indirectly to blame , says the BBC's Jill McGivering .
US officials said they were still committed to helping Pakistan fight militants .
" We condemn this brutal crime and reaffirm our commitment to support the Pakistani people in their efforts to defend their democracy from the violent extremists who seek to destroy it , " US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said in a statement .
The US embassy in Islamabad said the attack " demonstrates the terrorists ' blatant disregard for the lives of the Pakistani people and the future of this country " .
Last October the US committed to a five - year , $ 7.5 bn ( £ 4.94bn ) aid package to be spent on development projects .
The US has pressurised Pakistan to take action against Taliban insurgents using bases in the rugged border area along Afghanistan .
Lahore has been hit by a series of bomb attacks , including a suicide blast at anti-terrorist offices in March , when at least 13 people died .
BIG MILITANT ATTACKS 28 May 2010 - 93 people killed in attacks on two Ahmadi mosques in Lahore
19 Apr 2010 - At least 23 die in suicide bombing at market in Peshawar
1 Jan 2010 - A bomb at a volleyball match kills about 100
28 Oct 2009 - At least 120 die in car bomb attack on packed market in Peshawar
15 Oct 2009 - About 40 die in a series of gun and bomb attacks
9 Oct 2009 - At least 50 die in Peshawar suicide blast Pakistani militants return to roots
In May , more than 90 people were killed in a double attack on the minority Ahmadi sect in the city .
Earlier , security chiefs had been congratulating themselves after June was the first month in two years in which there had been no suicide bombings in Pakistan .
They said it was proof the militant networks had been disrupted .
Last year Pakistan launched a major military offensive against militant strongholds in South Waziristan .
In December the military said they had achieved victory , but subsequent reports have suggested the militants remain active in the region .

Why ORM is the Dumbest Idea Ever
Why NoSQL is a Terrible Idea
OMADS : the future of data storage
Why SQL Will Eventually Conquer The World
A little history
SQL was invented in the 1970s at the same time that " large - scale " ( read : millions of rows ) data stores came into existence .
It triumphed over other query languages not because it was particularly great ( though it was easier to read ) , but because it was standard .
Everybody building a data store could write to the SQL standard without having to re-train all their clients and customers .
It reduced friction all round .
It was a huge success .
SQL is awkward
There 's no escaping that SQL , as we use it day to day , is not pretty .
Keep in mind that what SQL is really designed to express is relational algebra , a type of logic essentially invented by the ridiculously clever E.F.
Codd ( along with nearly all the other theoretical underpinnings of relational databases ) .
If you 're not familiar with it , I find it helps to think about relational algebra as Venn diagrams : it 's about sets intersecting with , unioning with , subtracting from , joining with each other .
Find all the fruits in set A , with prices in set B , farmed by the farmer in set C .
That kind of thing .
What it 's not really for is collating , aggregating , and most especially filtering of data sets .
The reason count (* ) is so awkward is because that 's not really what the language was designed to do .
GROUP BY and ORDER BY clauses look tacked - on because they are ( HAVING is an even more grievous hack , UNIQUE is a disaster , and let 's not get started on LIMIT ) .
Of course , in regular use of a data set , you nearly always want to do these things , which is why SQL provides them .
SQL , loyal workhorse that it is , is nothing if not willing .
But it might not be terribly quick .
So you 're right .
SQL -- the kind you write every day -- is ugly and awkward .
In fact , it looks like hell on legs .
And it 's often pretty slow .
And that 's all because you 're asking it to do something it , the language , is not really designed to do ( whether the engine is designed to do it is another question ) .
But it works , and in forty years since its invention we have come up with very little in the way of improvements and nothing close to powerful enough to be a replacement .
What about ORM ?
I want to be very , very clear about this : ORM is a stupid idea .
The birth of ORM lies in the fact that SQL is ugly and intimidating ( because relational algebra is pretty hard , and very different to most other types of programming ) .
Our programs already have an object - oriented model , and we already know one programming language -- why learn a second language , and a second model ?
Let 's just throw an abstraction layer on top of this baby and forget there 's even an RDBMS down there .
This is obviously silly .
You 've stored your data in a way that does n't match your primary use - case , accessible via a language that you are not willing to learn .
Your solution is to keep the store and the language and just wrap them in abstraction ?
Maybe you 'd do that if your data were in a legacy system and you needed to write a new front - end , but people slap ORM on new projects .
Why the hell would you do that ?
ORM is slower than just using SQL , because abstraction layers always are .
But unlike other abstraction layers , which make up for their performance hit with faster development , ORM layers add almost nothing .
In fact , often , if you need to do anything more complicated then a SELECT , you end up writing fragments of SQL or pseudo - SQL languages in order to tell the underlying RDBMS what you 're trying to really do .
OMADS : data stores that match the application
ORM is dumb , and people noticed .
So clever programmers looked at this ridiculous edifice and realized the real problem : the data store and the use - case were mismatched .
So they threw away ORM , SQL , and RDBMS , and wrote lovely new key - value stores , or object stores , or document stores , or searchable indexes , or any of a half - dozen other data structures that more closely matched what they were trying to do .
And because these data stores all turned up at a time when nearly all data stores were SQL - interfaced RDBMS , they got the name " NoSQL " , even though the actual problem was the Relational model , not SQL itself .
And because " Obviously More Appropriate Data Stores " , or OMADS , is not catchy enough I guess .*
So I love NoSQL stores .
My startup would literally be unable to function without memcache .
I think Cassandra is nifty even if Twitter found it not worth the trouble of switching from MySQL .
I think Redis is cool if a little buggy .
MongoDB is awesome , and I 'm probably going to be building a production system based on it quite soon .
HDFS
I use in production every day , and it still blows my tiny little mind .
Really , the only think I dislike about them is the label " NoSQL " , which as many people have already pointed out does n't really say anything about what they are , just what they are not .
And also because it makes people unfamiliar with the details of the situation think there 's something Wrong , Bad or Old Fashioned about SQL .
And programmers hate using anything that is any of those things .
What is the relational data model good for anyway ?
So if your data store should always match your application , what application is it that RDBMS are perfect for ?
The answer is : all , and none .
We take this for granted these days , but the relational model is pretty magical .
Set up a model of your entities , pour data into it , and get answers .
How many teachers at the university earn over $ 100 k but teach less than 20 students ?
How many customers who bought our newest product had never bought anything before ?
What were sales like on Tuesdays over the last 30 months ?
You do n't have to know in advance what your questions will be ; you do n't have to write any special code to examine all the rows , or work out the most efficient strategy for combining the results : you just need to know how the data relate each other , and then you can ask ad - hoc questions and the database knows the answer .
I remember the first time I really grokked that concept , and it filled me with nerdy joy .
If you pick the wrong data structure for your store when you 're first writing your application , you can end up -- as happened to a team at my last job -- running crazy , days - long depth - first searches across distributed document stores in order to perform elementary operations like getting a total count of objects .
So if you do n't know all the questions you might need to ask about your data , the safest thing to do is put them in an RDBMS .
And when you first start a project , you almost never know all the questions you 're going to need to ask .
So my advice : always use an RDBMS .
Just do n't only use an RDBMS .
Optimize , but be prepared for ad - hoc queries
Is your data really just a giant hash lookup ?
Then a key - value store is what you want .
Do you primarily access your related data via a single key ?
Then a document store is for you .
Do you need full - text searching ?
Then , dear god , use a text - indexing engine , not an RDBMS .
Do you need to answer questions about your data that you can't predict in advance ?
Then make sure your data also ends up in an RDBMS .
Maybe not in real - time , maybe summarized rather than in raw form , but somehow .
Then when your co-founder asks " how many Xs happened in Y ? " your answer wo n't be " uh , let me spend half a day writing code to find that out " .
Just throw down some SQL , and it 'll give you an answer -- it 'll take 5 minutes to return a single number , but that 's a lot faster than half a day .
Because that 's what SQL is for .
Post - SQL
If you scroll back to the top you 'll see the description of the circumstances that gave birth to SQL : a whole bunch of new data stores came into existence at once , and the lack of a common language created friction and fragmentation .
The same thing is happening again with the NoSQL crowd .
If you decide to write your app using Cassandra , you better be sure it's what you want , because if you change stores you have to change all your code .
It 's the ultimate lock - in , and it's not the plan of an evil monopolist corporation , it 's just an unfortunate side - effect .
Pretty soon , the same sort of clever people who noticed that ORM was a ridiculous hack will notice an opening for an actually useful abstraction layer : a single common API that can access all the NoSQL stores .
Maybe it will be Thrift or Avro , but I 'm not sure .
I 'd say the chance is about 50 - 50 that it will be SQL again .
SQL triumphant
And why not ?
Awkward it may be , but SQL is a lot more succint and readable than multiple lines of API calls or crazy , math - like relational algebra languages .
And there 's nothing intrinsically slow about the language itself .
If you could run " SELECT * FROM table WHERE ... " on Cassandra , it would be no slower than specifying the same conditions via API calls .
In fact , when trying to explain how to use its API , the MongoDB documentation lists the equivalent SQL queries .
That 's a pretty clear vote for the usability of SQL .
Computer programmers really like new , cool things .
So when something like SQL hangs around for nearly 40 years , it either means nobody really cares about it -- I think we 're clear that 's not the case -- or that there 's really nothing else that can do the job quite as well .
So go forth , use your OMADS , keep an RDBMS in your back pocket , and stop being so mean to poor old SQL .
More troops than ever are surviving their battlefield injuries , often overloading the military 's health care system .
Massive blood shortages continue to plague military trauma care , and the problem is complicated by the remote , inaccessible locations of today 's war zones .
In 2008 , Darpa , the Pentagon 's blue - sky research arm , launched the Blood Pharming program , with the goal of manufacturing mega doses of universal - donor red blood units ( O- negative ) using a compact , self - contained system .
" Pharming " is the process of genetically engineering animals or plants to generate mass quantities of medically useful substances , like hormones or antibodies .
In this case , Darpa wants a synthetic platform that 's engineered to cultivate blood cells .
Now Arteriocyte , the Cleveland , OH biotech firm that got $ 1.95 million for the project , has sent off an initial shipment of their pharmed blood product to the Food and Drug Administration for an independent evaluation of the company 's blood - growing process .
It hopes to pass muster with agency 's safety regulators .
The blood was produced using hematopoietic cells , derived from umbilical cord - blood units .
It 's a trick that scientists have pulled off for years .
The hard part is making quantities of red stuff that are large enough for military or medical utility .
Currently , it takes Arteriocyte scientists three days to turn a single umbilical cord unit into 20 units of RBC - packed blood .
The average soldier needs six units during trauma treatment .
" We 're basically mimicking bone marrow in a lab environment , " company CEO Don Brown tells Danger Room .
" Our model works , but we need to extrapolate our production abilities to make scale . "
Darpa 's largely after an endless stream of war - zone blood .
Brown , whose company completed its Darpa work earlier this year and uses technology created at Johns Hopkins , thinks pharmed blood would have several advantages over relying on the real stuff .
Because most blood used in military operations is donated on U.S ground , it 's usually three weeks old by the time it hits the front lines .
The shelf - life of donated blood is still disputed .
The Red Cross tosses RBC units after 42 days , but some medical experts think that fresh blood " expires " after 28 days , and cite increased risk of infection and organ failure once blood is older than two weeks .
" Until now , the military 's strategy has mainly been contained to basically using stale blood , " says Brown .
" And they 'll set up mobile blood banks in a war zone , but even every troop rolling up their sleeve might not be enough when you 've got a crisis with dozens or more injuries . "
And because the method can get so much blood from a single cord unit , it'd also minimize risks associated with multiple - donation transfusions , which are common when a patient needs several units .
But while Arteriocyte think they 've mastered the formula for pharmed blood , the company 's got a ways to go to make it financially viable .
A single unit of pharmed blood currently runs them $ 5,000 .
Still , given the price tag of transporting and storing donated blood , Darpa 's betting that a unit of pharmed blood will make financial sense once it costs less than $ 1,000 .
Human trials are n't likely until 2013 , but the Pentagon could invoke " emergency protocol " to snag the blood sooner – Brown predicts military use within five years .

Image caption Ben Eine 's street art could now be hanging in the White House
A painting by a graffiti artist was among the official gifts to Barack Obama from David Cameron on his first trip to Washington as prime minister .
The work , Twenty First Century City , is by Ben Eine , said to be one of the PM's wife Samantha 's favourite artists .
The 39 - year - old artist recently sprayed the entire alphabet on shop shutters in a London street .
Mr Obama continued the art theme by presenting the Camerons with a signed lithograph by pop artist Ed Ruscha .
The piece , Column with Speed Lines , was chosen for its red , white and blue colours matching the British and American flags .
Beer bet
Writing on his website , Ben Eine said it had been a " weird day " because " David Cameron has given one of my paintings to President Obama in an art swap " .
The artist , who has worked with Banksy , began his career by " tagging " his name on buildings and trains around east London , examples of which are featured on his website under the heading " vandalism " .
In recent years he has been asked to decorate shutters in cities as far afield as Tokyo and New York .
Other gifts from the Camerons to the Obamas included two pairs of Hunter Wellington boots , one in pink and one in purple , for the first family 's two daughters .
For Michelle Obama , there were candles made by London - based perfumer Miller Harris .
Image caption Mr Cameron and Mr Obama swapped jokes at a White House news conference
Mr Cameron 's six - year - old daughter Nancy was given a silver charm necklace , and his son Elwen , four , was a given a DC United football shirt .
Samantha Cameron , who is expecting a child in September , received a gift basket including a baby blanket .
When Mr Cameron met President Obama at the G8/G20 summit in Toronto last month , they exchanged bottles of beer , following a bet on England 's World Cup clash with the US , which ended in a 1 - 1 draw .
Classic DVDs
The US president presented Mr Cameron with a bottle of Goose Island 312 from his home city of Chicago , while Mr Cameron gave Obama a bottle of Hobgoblin , made by the Wychwood brewery in his Oxfordshire constituency .
Swapping notes on the beers at a White House news conference on Tuesday , Mr Obama said the British bitter was excellent but confessed : " I did drink it cold . "
Mr Cameron joked that the American beer " was obviously very effective " because he had ended up cheering on Germany against Argentina while drinking it , " something that 's a big admission for a British person " .
Mr Obama was criticised for lack of thought when he presented previous prime minister Gordon Brown with a set of 25 DVDs of classic American films , when Mr Brown visited Washington .
Mr Brown gave the US president a pen holder made from the timbers of a Victorian anti-slavery ship .

KANDAHAR , AFGHANISTAN
— We are motoring down a bare - dirt back road in Kandahar Province , a road where NATO patrols never go .
This way is better , explains the ghost behind the wheel , because roads without soldiers tend not to explode .
The car is “ soft - skinned ” — no armour .
There are no body vests .
No helmets .
No blast goggles .
No convoy .
There is a gun on board , but it is concealed to avoid undue attention .
Just plain vanilla wheels with two men from Canada dressed as Afghans — one , the driver , surveying the way ahead with purposeful , probing eyes , the other , a reporter , wondering what fresh hell awaits on this sweltering Friday afternoon .
“ Do n't worry .
I know these roads better than most Afghans , ” says the ghost , as we cross the Tarnac River Afghan - style — by driving right through it .
He is Panjwaii Tim , a 41 - year - old from small - town Manitoba who cites Don Cherry and carries with him a Winnipeg Blue Bombers cap .
A few years back he worked in Afghanistan the conventional way — as a reservist with the Canadian Forces , a tour replete with frustrations .
Too few troops .
Too much territory .
Too much confusion about which way forward .
And just as he began to really understand this place — gone .
With another fresh batch of wide - eyed six - monthers in his wake .
Rinse and repeat .
Now a much - savvier Panjwaii
Tim is back on his own terms , not with the military but leading one of the last major Western aid groups still operating freely in Kandahar City , an outfit fast gaining a reputation for uncommon courage .
A group dubbed “ Team Canada . ”
Nearly every other civilian foreigner has fled Kandahar .
Some have taken refuge inside nearby NATO bases , others have retreated to comparably calmer Kabul .
But not Team Canada , despite the rash of bombs and targeted killings that torment this crucial southern city .
They are working under the radar to rapidly turn tens of millions of international aid dollars into jobs for thousands of Afghan men .
Fighting - age Afghan men , you understand , some of whom , in their desperation for income , would join the only other gainful employers in town — the cash - paying Taliban , or , more likely , one of the corrupt private armies that Panjwaii Tim assesses bluntly as “ akin to the Sicilian mafia . ”
Never mind hearts and minds , Team Canada is about hands and bellies — a largely invisible aid network on the front line , offering stay - alive sustenance to Afghans who might otherwise plant roadside bombs aimed at sending more Canadian bodies home down the Highway of Heroes .
Given the unique and risky manner in which they work — low - key , low - security — Team Canada is not looking for attention .
But word is trickling out anyway in the wake of a startling , praise - filled post on the military blog Free Range International , which in April anointed Panjwaii Tim and his colleagues with the Team Canada nickname .
And it dared NATO commanders to take lessons from Team Canada 's nimble ways and let at least some troops shed the suffocating armour and lumbering metal that encases them .
“ They are the best crew in the country , ” the blogger , Tim Lynch , an American contractor who does work similar to Team Canada in safer Nangahar Province , wrote in an email to the Star .
“ They have balls the size of grapefruit . ”
It was through Lynch that the Star made first contact with Team Canada and , after careful negotiation , scored an invitation to meet them .
The Canadian military today requires reporters to fill out 47 pages of forms before embedding .
Panjwaii
Tim required only a handshake — and a solemn promise on the ground rules .
“ We 're proud of the work we do .
But you understand the stakes : this is life or death for us .
No last names , no naming our NGO .
No precise description of where we live .
The danger is real .
Do not make me regret this . ”
Not that you would know it , for nowhere are the telltale signs of a war - zone Western compound : barbed wire , Hesco blast barrier , sandbagged machine gun turrets .
This is just another walled and gated compound in a city of walled , gated compounds .
Inside , however , the operation is vast , half a city block jammed with three main buildings , each with walls of its own and linked by multiple passageways , and a sprawling logistics yard .
People abound .
Five to 10 Team Canada expats are in charge at any given time and there are always dozens of carefully vetted Afghan staff .
It needs to be big because this is no branch office .
The compound is a full - blown national headquarters overseeing Team Canada 's operations in 14 of Afghanistan 's most precarious provinces , all backed by tens of millions in international donor aid .
The money dries up at the end of September , but already Team Canada has been told by coalition diplomats in Kabul to be ready for an even larger chunk of aid cash to come , and to be ready to expand to other provinces .
One quickly discovers Team Canada is actually Team World .
A third of this group calls Canada home , but others are from Britain , New Zealand , Texas , New York ; some are development specialists , others ex-soldiers .
All wear beards of varying lengths ; most speak at least some Pashto ; the fairer ones have dyed their hair dark to better blend in .
William , a New Zealander who oversees team security , leads me on a tour of the two - storey complex to identify the triage bay , the armoury and the muster area should we come under sudden attack .
Along the way we see a well - equipped weight room and a few home comforts : wireless Internet hub , flat - screen TV , a Wii console .
William instructs me to prepare a “ bug - out bag : ” passport , money , phone , a change of clothes and work computer .
If the call comes to run for the hills , be ready .
Twenty or so vehicles are in the compound .
One of the keys to Team Canada 's impressive freedom of movement is never taking the same car ( or the same road ) in any discernable pattern .
Almost all are older Corollas and dust - encrusted Land Cruisers , indistinguishable from the Toyotas Afghans drive .
There is also a small fleet of Chinese motorbikes .
Panjwaii
Tim quips that they came from the local “ Haji Davidson ” dealership .
“ They are another means of escape if the ‘ zombie hordes ' come over the wall . ”
It 's gallows humour , but longer - serving members of this team vividly remember the night they actually saw the zombie hordes : June 13 , 2008 , when Taliban fighters blasted through the walls of Sarposa Prison on the city 's western edge , releasing all 1,200 inmates in the single largest jailbreak in modern history .
“ We heard the explosions and the firefight .
And then a wave of escapees came running down the street toward us .
It looked like Kandahar was about to fall , ” says Ryan , a South African .
The compound was armed and ready .
As the night unfolded , the escapees vanished .
No contact .
In April , a massive truck - borne suicide bomb managed to penetrate the gates of another foreign compound elsewhere in the city .
That blast cleared Kandahar of almost all its Westerners and left Team Canada with an agonizing decision : to stay or go .
After painstaking consideration , they stayed .
At first , their stand was tentative , with an around - the - clock watch .
“ We just became more vigilant , taking it up several notches .
To say more than that would be giving away our secrets , ” says Panjwaii Tim .
Within days of the blast , Team Canada received a huge vote of confidence .
A tribal elder with whom they had worked closely arrived unbidden with his own armed security team , standing shoulder - to - shoulder with the expats for a full week .
“ To know that you have friends on the Afghan side who will put their own lives on the line for you — that was a decisive moment , ” says Panjwaii Tim .
“ Things are still on a knife - edge , to some extent .
We can't let down our guard .
But the way we roll , it is not just about being under the radar .
A big part of it is building trust with Afghans .
We 're not out there waving guns around .
We 're out there putting people to work .
There are tribal leaders who respect us for that and so we 're not alone , really .
We have a network willing to stand up and help us help them . ”
“ Pashtun culture is really not that different from my home in Manitoba , ” says Tim .
“ Where I come from everything works on a handshake .
No contracts .
You make a deal , you honour it — period .
That 's exactly how Afghans are .
If you live up to the bargain you will make incredibly loyal friends .
“ One of the issues here is that tribal leaders hear so many promises and every six months there 's a fresh foreign face sitting down with them , ignoring the old promises that were n't kept and making new ones .
That 's not a minor thing .
It would n't go over very well in my town either . ”
The other key part of the approach is the ghostlike , under - armed way Team Canada fits into Afghan society .
Nate , a 24 - year - old Texan who helps liaise with international donors , tells of being stuck inside a “ bubble ” during an earlier posting in Iraq .
“ Every time we went out , I was surrounded by soldiers with guns .
We were n't fooling anybody .
There was no ability to develop relationships with local people .
The only moves you could do were with military escort .
And the locals often could n't come to the base because of security concerns .
“ That is what is unique about this approach , ” says Nate .
“ You wo n't find another NGO with so large a budget , operating so broadly , with so low a profile .
There 's nowhere near the same bureaucracy .
When we want to go out and see people , we go .
Granted we are very cautious .
We move in soft - skinned vehicles , dressed as Afghans .
But this way we have a mobility that others do n't because they 're required by their legal departments to go around in these bubbles .
We are n't . ”
Team Canada 's techniques took 10 years to develop , Panjwaii Tim explains , combining and refining lessens learned since 2001 , when the first Westerners arrived in Afghanistan following the attacks of 9/11 .
To even a casual observer , they appear to be approaches NATO and other agencies would do well to emulate .
Tim notes that “ living within the community , working with the populace shoulder to shoulder ” once was a hallmark of Special Forces .
Now he says he hears nothing but “ frustrations ” from the elite Canadian commandos with JTF2 , who , though stationed on the outskirts of Kandahar , appear rarely to leave their base .
“ JTF2 is not a very happy bunch , ” says another Team Canada member .
“ Every move they make needs to be approved by Ottawa , and by the time the answer comes , the opportunity is gone .
So they 're stuck there . ”
Yet a few minutes later we are motoring down empty streets , ghosts once more .
There appear to be more armed checkpoints than normal and Panjwaii Tim takes extra care , choosing a route to avoid the guns .
We approach another set of anonymous compound doors .
An Afghan guard nods clearance .
Seconds later , a burly Westerner bids us welcome , a hearty hug for Panjwaii Tim , a viselike yet cautious handshake for the reporter .
Here 's where the telling gets especially frustrating because though this turns out to be far and away the most interesting of the nearly 200 evenings I 've spent in Kandahar since 2002 , most of it must stay in the notebook until after this conflict is over .
Our host is a private security contractor whose work is too sensitive to risk exposure while he is in the field .
But his regard for Panjwaii Tim is such that he has gathered all the precious treats in the house and assembled an astonishing rooftop party for three , replete with a case of homemade beer , Cuban cigars and , on the coal - fired grill , a mound of Alaskan king crab legs — likely the only crustaceans for a thousand kilometres in any direction .

Who is this guy ?
We will call him John .
Ex-special forces from a country we can not name .
Spent time in Iraq .
And here now in Kandahar , like Panjwaii Tim , a veteran of this incredibly rarefied work that involves venturing way past the lines NATO considers certain death .
But unlike Panjwaii Tim , John 's smaller team sometimes works directly with NATO special forces in far - flung , unstable districts .
Making advance contact with key tribal leaders , working deals to ensure safe meetings , setting the table for the first Western military boots on the ground .
And , in some cases , actually showing special forces how to get there .
Over the evening , Tim and John compare notes , working through their mutual depth of knowledge of the Afghan players , big and small .
Trading their most valued commodity , information , on who can help and who can hurt the cause .
John actually tries to hire Panjwaii Tim on this night , to steal him from Team Canada .
More money , less paperwork .
Tim politely declines .
He likes his job .
I ask both about trade secrets — how they are able to put themselves so far into danger 's way without a net .
Both speak of Pashtunwali , their absolute life - or - death faith that Pashtun tribes will keep their promises .
“ If a leader tells you that on this day at this hour you can take this road and nothing will happen , it will be so , ” says John .
“ But it works the other way as well .
I once had a tribal leader tell me , ‘ If you break your word we will kill you . '
I have no doubt that also is true . ”
John says it 's not just a matter of Western expats saying the right words .
He turns to Tim and says , “ You , for example , have that added X factor .
I can hardly put it into words .
But you put 100 other guys in front an Afghan leader saying the same things and they wo n't be impressed .
But you , Tim . . . the Afghans sense your authenticity and they know you are real .
Whatever it is , you have it . ”
Tim squirms uncomfortably with the praise .
Later , I ask him about the X factor .
“ It is n't rocket surgery , as Don Cherry would say .
All it takes is hard boots - on - the - ground work and the ability to live long periods in austere environments .
You need a dedication to live amongst and learn about the local community .
And most of all , you need a strong corporate support network to allow this to happen in a non-bureaucratic manner .
. . .
That last part is essential . ”
Tim 's a “ family man . ”
He does n't want you to know how many and where his kids live , but he says he would be with them in Canada today if not for his chance encounter with the smaller , earlier version of what is now Team Canada during his seven - month tour as a soldier in Panjwaii district three years ago .
“ I got to know Panjwaii well during my tour and if you can understand Panjwaii , you can understand the insurgency in general .
But I saw the way the Team Canada operated and I wanted to operate like that too . ”
On the ride back that night , I notice Tim adjusting a knife sheathed beneath his shalwar kameez .
An antique Bowie knife with a storied history — it went to war twice before , in WWI and WWII — with Tim 's grandfather and great - grandfather , both soldiers from Manitoba .
“ This knife is pretty well travelled .
The thing is , it did n't come home after six months .
They did n't bring it back until the job was done . ”
Stopping brings danger of another sort .
Because no matter how well your head is wrapped , Kandahars can spot a non-Pashtun from great distance .
And you do n't want that .
Smiling or laughing , for example , is discouraged when this crew is travelling because , well , the people of Kandahar hardly ever smile .
Even the Afghan National Police can be bad news for non-military Westerners .
Sometimes the ANP checkpoints are manned by 18 - year - olds shaking in their boots .
But there 's also the risk of criminals or insurgents posing in stolen uniforms .
Team Canada members have a nose for these things .
A sixth sense that enables them to calmly motor through things that would reduce most Westerners to a jangling bundle of nerves .
The work itself is all about , well , work — creating as much as possible as quickly as possible for Afghans who might otherwise be lost to the insurgency .
And we see it firsthand throughout Kandahar , a city of roughly 800,000 where , at present , 2,200 Afghan men are working on low - cost , high - impact projects .
In four locations , we walk among hundreds of Afghans building sidewalks under the hot sun .
At each site , one crew levels and grades by hand , while others mix and cast concrete , followed by skilled masons who finish the job .
So far , Team Canada 's workers have laid 50 kilometres of sidewalk in Kandahar City .
At other sites , canal and drainage ditches are being cleaned .
At one point , we visit the new Kandahar garbage dump near the Tarnac River basin , where Team Canada is overseeing the city 's entire sanitation system .
Team Canada is focusing on Afghanistan 's most problematic districts , those most recently held by the Taliban .
“ We 're the first ones in , ” explains Nate , the Texan .
“ The idea is to be as labour - intensive as possible .
If it 's a drainage ditch , for example , you might be able to dig it in a week with big machines .
But instead , we use men with shovels , and that way employ several hundred for several months .
As we reach the peak of the fighting season , that vulnerable population desperate for employment has an option other than to become prime recruits for insurgents . ”
But every morning the routine is the same — all gather around a vast circular breakfast table for a daily security update , which lately involves eyebrow - raising information about spiralling violence .
One such morning the Star arrived at the table just as Panjwaii Tim was grimly warning about the consequences of gunfire : prosecution by Afghan officials .
“ If any of you shoot an Afghan , your career is over .
You are done . ”
Yet there are times when the guns come out .
Ours occurs on Day 5 , as we return from a morning surveying projects only to find a suspicious Afghan loitering in front of the gate .
“ I do n't know this guy .
What is he doing here ?
This is bad , ” says Panjwaii Tim .
He does n't need to say aloud what we 're both thinking — suicide bomber .
A split - second later , Panjwaii Tim raises a pistol — showing it to , but not pointing it directly toward , the unknown Afghan .
He waves the gun menacingly , gesturing the man away from the gate .
The Afghan quickly obliges .
What happens next , however , reveals more about the character of this crew .
After pulling inside the compound , Panjwaii
Tim puts his gun away and returns unarmed — apologetic , even — to ask the man 's business .
Speaking in Pashto , the man pleads for work to feed his family .
And he produces a typed letter , written in English , bearing the Canadian flag .
It is a testimonial from a Canadian military commander , circa 2007 , attesting to the man 's efforts assisting an earlier troop rotation .
Panjwaii
Tim scans the letter .
Phone numbers are exchanged .
Promises given .
Two days later the man is building sidewalks under the watchful eyes of the Canadian ghosts .

Every few months I trip over another earnest attempt to rectify the gender imbalance in software and computing fields .
Very few women opt to become programmers , system administrators , or hardware / software engineers .
Indeed , the number of women who try seems to be falling rather than rising .
This observation is invariably accompanied by a lot of hand - wringing and proposals for elaborate and ( too often ) coercive schemes to achieve “ gender parity ” – all doomed , because the actual problem is misdiagnosed .
I ’m writing about this because I think the misdiagnosis arises largely from a refusal to speak uncomfortable truths .
Discussion of the problem is nearly suffocated under a cloud of political correctness , cant , and willful blindness to the actual conditions of working in this field .
Honesty wo n’t automatically fix the problems , but it ’s a prerequisite to fixing the problems .
Let ’s get one shibboleth out of the way first : Larry Summers was right to be skeptical about the prospects for “ equality ” in STEM ( science , technology , math , engineering ) fields in general .
Just the difference in dispersion of the IQ curves for males and females guarantees that , let alone the significant differences in mean at spatial visualization and mathematical ability .
Removing all the institutional , social and psychological barriers will not achieve a 1:1 sex ratio in these fields ; the best we can hope for is a large , happy female minority – that is , as opposed to a small and unhappy one .
It needs pointing out that 1:1 parity is not achievable without coercing men out of these fields , because there are actually political moves afoot in the U.S. to try to achieve this through an extension of federal Title IX legislation to STEM fields .
This would be a disaster , compounding already - serious incentive problems in academia that threaten the U.S. ’s ability to sustain STEM research at all .
( Summary : Cash - strapped corporations wo n’t fund basic research , and the academic system to support it is collapsing because grad students are underpaid , overworked , and no longer have a realistic shot at tenure . )
Having recognized this , though , formulating a goal with recognizable win conditions does get more difficult .
It has to go something like this : any woman who wants to be in a STEM field should be able to get as far as talent , hard work , and desire to succeed will take her , without facing artificial barriers erected by prejudice or other factors .
If there are women who dream of being in STEM but have felt themselves driven off that path , the system is failing them .
And the system is failing itself , too ; talent is not so common that we can afford to waste it .
Now I ’m going to refocus on computing , because that ’s what I know best and I think it exhibits the problems that keep women out of STEM fields in an extreme form .
There ’s a lot of political talk that the tiny and decreasing number of women in computing is a result of sexism and prejudice that has to be remedied with measures ranging from sensitivity training up through admission and hiring quotas .
This talk is lazy , stupid , wrong , and prevents correct diagnosis of much more serious problems .
I do n’t mean to deny that there is still prejudice against women lurking in dark corners of the field .
But I ’ve known dozens of women in computing who would n’t have been shy about telling me if they were running into it , and not one has ever reported it to me as a primary problem .
The problems they did report were much worse .
They centered on one thing : women , in general , are not willing to eat the kind of shit that men will swallow to work in this field .
Now let ’s talk about death marches , mandatory uncompensated overtime , the beeper on the belt , and having no life .
Men accept these conditions because they ’re easily hooked into a monomaniacal , warrior - ethic way of thinking in which achievement of the mission is everything .
Women , not so much .
Much sooner than a man would , a woman will ask : “ Why , exactly , am I putting up with this ? ”
Correspondingly , young women in computing - related majors show a tendency to tend to bail out that rises directly with their comprehension of what their working life is actually going to be like .
Biology is directly implicated here .
Women have short fertile periods , and even if they do n’t consciously intend to have children their instincts tell them they do n’t have the option young men do to piss away years hunting mammoths that are n’t there .
There are other issues , too , like female unwillingness to put up with working environments full of the shadow - autist types that gravitate to programming .
But I think those are minor by comparison , too .
If we really want to fix the problem of too few women in computing , we need to ask some much harder questions about how the field treats everyone in it .
British scientists gear up for space mission to find life on Mars
Scientists today announced the start of work on instruments that will be used in a new mission to Mars in 2018 .
Academics from the University of Leicester are among a group of scientists working on the high - tech equipment for the ExoMars mission .
The project - Exobiology on Mars - is a European - led robotic mission to Mars , developed by the European Space Agency ( ESA ) and Nasa .
It is one of the key missions under the remit of the newly - formed UK Space Agency .
University of Leicester Professor Mark Sims with a development model of the Mars Rover , called Bridget , at the University , as he is leading a team of scientists who will start work on some of the instruments that will be used for the ExoMars mission in 2018
Part of ESA 's Aurora programme for robotic exploration of the solar system , the mission will study the chemical , geological and possible biological environment on Mars in preparation for robotic missions and then human exploration .
The data gathered will also contribute to broader studies of exobiology - the search for life on other planets .
Scientists at the University of Leicester announced the start of work today , in collaboration with industry , on some of the advanced instruments to be used in the mission .
They will be involved in five instruments on board , including building the hardware for three of the instruments on the craft .
Professor Mark Sims , from the university , is leading the international team in constructing the Life Marker Chip ( LMC ) , which aims to find organic molecules that could be associated with life , or organics that may have fallen with meteors on to the surface .
He said : ' ExoMars is a key mission in exploration of the planet Mars .
Bridget can be operated using remote control
' It will attempt to gather samples from a depth one to two metres below the surface where they are protected from radiation and oxidants thought to exist on the surface - both of which would destroy / heavily degrade complex organic compounds .
' The mission gives the university , and the Space Research Centre ( SRC ) team in particular , the opportunity to explore the chemistry and mineralogy of Mars as well as look at the possibility of life on Mars in the distant past , or even today , and at the same time create world - class science .
' Because of its innovative work in space instrumentation , which builds upon the SRC expertise in imaging detectors and its interdisciplinary work on sensor systems , the university is providing several instruments .
' This is a truly exciting opportunity to explore Mars and look for extra-terrestrial life .
' This is a massive thing in anybody 's career .
The next few years are going to be amazingly busy , this will be my main task for the next four or five years . '
Prof Sims 's colleagues from the university will also be taking part in the creation of two other instruments .
Richard Ambrosi is part of the team , led by Italy , involved in the development of an X - ray Diffraction Instrument , which looks at the composition of soil and rocks .
Ian Hutchinson is part of a Spanish - led team developing a Raman Spectrometer , which looks at mineralogy and possibly detects organics in soil and rocks .
Prof Sims said other universities from across the country are also involved , including the University of Bradford , University College London , the University of Aberystwyth , Cranfield University and Imperial College London .
After prototypes are built and confirmation of the mission by ESA , he said University of Leicester teams will start to gear up for the design and build of the various test models of the instruments and building flight instruments due to be delivered in 2014 .
Local industry in the East Midlands and key UK companies will be involved in the build , he said .
Today 's announcement coincided with celebrations marking the 50th anniversary of space research at the University of Leicester .
To mark the occasion , an engineering model of the Mars Rover , called Bridget , developed by Astrium in the UK , was on display .
Space craft engineer Jessica Housden makes adjustments to the solar panel
The Mars mission is thought to have major Earth - bound applications , with spin - offs in collaboration with industry bringing environmental benefits as well as technology that can be applied in health and crime detection .
The ExoMars instruments have so far been funded by the Science and Technology Facilities Council .
Funding of the flight instruments will be via the UK Space Agency , the university said today .
Prof Sims added : ' The University of Leicester and the UK has a major international role in this key mission .
' The work associated with the ExoMars mission will be a major part of the University 's Space Research Centre programme until launch of the mission in 2018 and after that , with operations and ' new science ' on the surface of Mars from 2019 .
' For the last 50 years at the University of Leicester , we have been exploring the universe via astronomy : since 1993 the Earth and since 1995 the planets and Mars in particular .
We must preserve our racial identity

I am running as a candidate for state representative in Grafton County District 8 .
I am running as a Republican , but I have been endorsed by the American Third Position .
I am also the American Third Position state chairman of New Hampshire .
The American Third Position is a political party that stands for the interests of white Americans .
For far too long white Americans have been told that diversity is something beneficial to their existence .
Statistics prove that the opposite is true .
New Hampshire residents must seek to preserve their racial identity if we want future generations to have to possibility to live in such a great state .
Affirmative action , illegal and legal non-white immigration , anti-white public school systems , and an anti-white media have done much damage to the United States of America and especially New Hampshire .
It is time for white people in New Hampshire and across the country to take a stand .
We are only 8 percent of the world 's population and we need our own homeland , just like any other non-white group of people deserve their own homeland .
What will happen to New Hampshire once it is only 60 , 50 or 40 percent white ?
Statistics show that areas with high non-white populations have higher rates of violent crime .
New Hampshire has one of the lowest rates of violent crime in the country , but that will change as the white population percentage declines and the non-white population percentage increases .
I urge New Hampshire residents to go to the American Third Position website and read for yourself what it is all about .

The original Declaration of Independence
To help you celebrate the Fourth of July a few years ago , we posted a list of 5 Obscure Facts About the Declaration of Independence , namely :
There was no " United States " in the Declaration of Independence
in the Declaration of Independence Jefferson was upset that slavery was edited out
The youngest signer was 26 - year - old Edward Rutledge and the oldest was 70 - year - old Benjamin Franklin .
Edward Rutledge and the oldest was Benjamin Franklin .
Richard Stockton was the only one that ever recanted his oath ( after he was captured by the British )
( after he was captured by the British ) Bargain hunter bought an old copy of the Declaration of Independence at a flea market for $ 4 , and sold it for more than $ 8 millions .
This year , let 's add 5 more neat facts :
Thomas Jefferson : Called Americans " Subjects "
Historians have always wondered about a smear under the word " citizens " in an early draft of the Declaration of Independence .
They 've wondered if Jefferson had written " our fellow patriots " or " our fellow residents . "
Using a spectral imaging technology , researchers revealed the truth : Jefferson had a Freudian slip and wrote " subjects " instead of citizens .
" Seldom can we re-create a moment in history in such a dramatic and living way , " Library of Congress preservation director Dianne van der Reyden said at Friday 's announcement of the discovery .
" It 's almost like we can see him write ' subjects ' and then quickly decide that 's not what he wanted to say at all , that he did n't even want a record of it , " she said .
" Really , it sends chills down the spine . " ( Source )
The Original Declaration of Independence : Faded and Rolled Up
You'd think that the original Declaration of Independence - the very document that founded the United States of America - would be treated with respect .
Well , it is now .
It is stored in special , bullet - proof encasement made of titanium with gold plated frames and filled with inert argon gas to prevent decomposition , but that was n't the case right after it was signed ( see the faded and beat up copy above ) .
According to historian Pauline Maier , who wrote American Scripture : Making the Declaration of Independence , explains :
It was n't taken care of very well in the early years .
It was sort of rolled up , carried around with the Second Continental Congress .
And then the State Department kept it , and if people came , they 'd pull it out and show it to them .
None of this , you know , enormous -- What do they call it ?-- at the Library of Congress - - argon caskets , you know , these heavy metal , glass cases that have gas in them without oxygen so that the documents do n't decompose .
And the Library of Congress keeps them sort of in a refrigerator .
It 's the most precious documents -- none of that .
I mean , they just pulled it out and showed it to you , the real thing .
And then they got tired of pulling it out , so they pasted it up on a wall in what was then the patent office , and there it remained for 30 years near a very bright window .
It faded .
And they spent a considerable amount of time trying to figure out what they could do with it .
Modern preservation techniques are really a quite recent development .

Handprint on the Declaration of Independence
Indeed , there is a handprint in the bottom left corner of the Declaration of Independence .
How it got there is n't known , but historians think that it was because it was handled so casually in the early days of the Republic .
You can download a high - resolution image of the Declaration of Independence at Archives.org 's Charters of Freedom : Link
It Was Not Written On Paper
It was n't written on hemp either , despite the insistence of your pot-smoking friend .
The Declaration of Independence was written on parchment , which is basically treated animal skin ( typically sheepskin ) .
It was inked with iron gall ink , which is made by combining fermented oak marble galls with ferrous sulfate .
The Back of the Declaration of Independence

Yes , there actually was something written in the back of the Declaration of Independence .
But instead of an invisible map like in the Nicholas Cage blockbuster movie National Treasure , it only said " Original Declaration of Independence , dated 4th July 1776 " at the bottom of the document , upside down .
A new cap placed over a ruptured oil well in the Gulf of Mexico has begun to funnel oil to the surface .
US Coast Guard chief Adm Thad Allen said rough estimates showed that 1,000 barrels a day were being captured .
This is only a small part of the 12,000 - 19,000 barrels a day believed to be leaking and BP says it could take 48 hours to know if the system is working .
Meanwhile , President Obama arrived in Louisiana for his third visit to the region since the crisis began .
The visit to the Gulf area comes as beaches in the key tourist area of north - west Florida saw their first major signs of oil .
' Heartbroken '
Adm Allen stressed that he could not give any certain figures on the amount being funnelled from the leaking well .
" Sometime later [ on Friday ] we 'll probably be able to get an approximation of how much oil we are capturing , " he said .
BP IN NUMBERS Profits in 2009 : $ 13.96bn
Clean - up costs so far : $ 990 m
Estimated cost of sand barrier project : $ 360 m
Dividend payment 2009 : $ 10.5 bn
BP scheduled to make a first - quarter dividend payment to shareholders on 21 June
At its worst , BP saw 34 % wiped off its value BP defers dividend cut decision Just how angry are people at BP ?
In pictures : Oil spill 's impact
Adm Allen said that the amount should increase as BP shut off vents to capture more of the oil .
He added : " Progress is being made , but we need to caution against over - optimism . "
But BP chief operating officer Doug Suttles said he was " pretty confident " the plan would work .
" It probably wo n't capture all of the flow .
But it should capture the vast majority , " he said .
BP says it has spent more than $ 1bn so far on the operation to contain the spill and clean up the oil .
In a conference call to investors , BP chief executive Tony Hayward said it could take 48 hours before the system was optimised and a determination made on whether it had succeeded .
He said BP was " heartbroken " by the loss of life , damage to the environment and impact on people 's livelihoods caused by the spill .
Eleven workers lost their lives when the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig , leased to BP , exploded and sank in April .
The estimates for the amount of oil that has already leaked vary widely from 20 million to 45 million gallons .
BP had previously made a number of unsuccessful efforts to halt the leak and accepts it may not be fully contained until relief wells now being drilled become ready in August .
Attempt to cap oil leak
The latest stage in BP 's efforts to contain leaking oil has involved lowering a cap onto the failed blowout preventer ( BOP ) valve system on the seabed .
The cap sits on the BOP 's lower marine riser package ( LMRP ) section .
First , the damaged riser - the pipe which takes oil from the well - was cut where it nears the seabed using a remotely - operated shear .
This was completed at 1930 CDT on 1 June ( 0030 GMT 2 June ) .
The next stage was for a diamond wire cutter to saw through the riser close to the LMRP .
The blade got stuck and had to be removed but BP eventually cut through the pipe using giant shears manipulated by undersea robots ( ROV ) .
After removing the pipe , the cap was lowered onto the LMRP enabling the leaking oil and gas to be funnelled to a drill ship on the surface .
Latest estimates suggest more than half of the leaking oil is now being captured .
BACK {current} of {total} NEXT
Mr Hayward said BP was working hard to rebuild the trust of the American people and to ensure such an event would never happen again .
He admitted that people wanted to know the cause of the disaster .
But he said it was a complex accident caused by an " unprecedented number of failures " and " a lot remains unknown " .
He said a " separate stand - alone " organisation would be created within BP to deal with the Gulf of Mexico spill .
The company also said it would not make a decision on its next dividend payment until late July .
BBC economics correspondent Andrew Walker says if it does pay the dividend , this will go down very badly in the US , where pressure is mounting for BP to retain the cash for the clean - up .
Trip cancelled
President Obama is to meet Adm Allen , other officials , and members of local communities affected by the spill during his visit .
He told CNN on Thursday that BP had already " felt his anger " over the spill and that he was " furious at this entire situation " .
Mr Obama has for the second time postponed a trip to Australia , Indonesia and Guam , in order to deal with the crisis .
The area affected by the oil slick continues to spread .
Tar balls have now begun to wash up on the beaches of Alabama and north - west Florida .
At Pensacola Beach in Florida , swimmers encountered an oil sheen and children picked up tar blobs as big as tennis balls .
Christian Matyi would like to take his shirt off without you psychoanalyzing him , or projecting onto him your own insecurities .
Capiche ?
Few things I can do are more politically charged than taking off my shirt .
You see , I belong to a visible minority .
And like so many minorities , my presence can be unsettling for those who are n’t “ used to my kind . ”
But unlike those minorities defined by more uncontrollable features ( disability , skin color ) , I chose my minority status .
I am a bodybuilder — and not just some sporty guy with a Gold ’s Gym membership who wants to show off his boyish abs .
I ’m a bodybuilder with a capital “ B. ” You know the type .
I ’m a big , muscular guy whose proportions are a little more exaggerated than just your average dude who hits the weights .
My back is almost as wide as some doorways , and my leg girth converts “ loose fit ” into “ slim fit . ”
My measurements confound the suit tailors of the world .
Everything I ’ve done to my shape in the past seventeen - plus years has put me in a minority class .
And , frankly , I ’m happy to be there .
Unfortunately , some people do n’t share my contentedness .
I am often bumped — literally shoulder - checked — in crowded supermarkets and laundromats by hipsters and preppy girls who exude an attitude of , “ Oh , I did n’t notice your massive frame directly in front of me !
Hope the irony of that does n’t BUG you , Mr. Big-man . ”

People seem to want to talk about my body .
Often it ’s in a derisive way , akin to when people want to mock a silly tattoo : “ And what does that symbol mean to you ? ” they ’ll ask condescendingly .
“ Which tribe , exactly , does that tribal tattoo represent ? ”
There ’s an undertone of blame to their comments .
How dare I make people around me self - conscious about their own form ?!
No one actually says that aloud , but it ’s clear from the tone .
I hear everything from , “ Well , obviously you want people to talk to you about your body ” to “ I would n’t want to go to a beach with you because I could n’t enjoy my day . ”
Statements like these , from friends and strangers alike , are where it gets political .
I try to be courteous , but engaging people about body perception only fires up more heat .
It ’s as if they want to work through all of their male body issues in a cutesy two - minute interaction .
My body is seen as an invite for a unique brand of sound - bite , body - image therapy .
The message that often ends up coming across is a weird , chilling Orwellian dictate :
The body of a bodybuilder is not his own — it ’s public domain , to be used for debate on issues relating to the body .
The choice to be a bodybuilder is a forfeiture of unique perception .
The bodybuilder has volunteered to become a tool for pop-psychology chatter .
Many people presume that a guy would n’t build his muscles past the point of “ fashionably normal ” unless he has a massive dent in his psyche .
Ironically , that ’s often true , but that ’s a discussion for a future column .
The point is that whenever I take off my shirt — or even wear a tank top — this argument breaks out , and opinions spring forth like geysers .
It ’s hard for my size not to show .
Dress loose , and I look bigger .
Dress tight , and I look … well , you get the idea .
I am visibly a bodybuilder , and I ca n’t hide that .
( Nor would I , even if I could . )
But should I choose to show a little more muscle — maybe a sleeveless shirt , or ( gasp ! ) no shirt on a hot day — these derisively intoned conversations break out .
When the guy in a Starbucks starts play - acting that I ’m going to beat him up if he accidentally cuts me in line , it ’s not really a compliment .
When the woman at a cash register wants to scold me for buying cheese and ice cream — every time I buy cheese and ice cream — it gets monotonous and obnoxious .
It feels belittling , not victorious , when I get teased at the beach — at the beach ! — for having visible abs , as if my goal is to intentionally make others feel uncomfortable .
No one likes to feel like the villain if they have n’t committed the crime , but it ’s enough to make a bodybuilder want to go back to being lazy .
I ’m not sure when the heroic male form became such a common enemy .
But , unlike real political views , the politics of the body are open topics triggered by the “ poor slobs ” who dare not dress in bags .
I ’d always though that if I were to be credited with radicalism , it would have involved exploding buildings , fringe political ideals , and clandestine ransom videos .
But , alas , the fastest way for me to upset the American norm is to show up shirtless .

Ok , das wird jetzt lächerlich .
Gegen die Verwendung der Piratenpartei -Mitgliedsdaten für die Einführung von Liquid Feedback ist ja Klage beim Schiedsgericht erhoben worden .
Davon kann man halten was man will , ist aber gutes Recht des Klägers .
Das Schiedsgericht hat dann erstmal LF per einstweiliger Anordnung gestoppt um in Ruhe eine Entscheidung zu finden .
Da die Thematik , gerade bei einer datenschutzorientierten Gruppierung wie der Piratenpartei , nicht gerade einfach ist , halte ich das für eine gute Idee .
Auf die paar Wochen kommt das jetzt wirklich nicht an .
Was ich aber für absolut lächerlich halte ist das " Vergleichsangebot " an Bodo Thiesen :
Sollten sie die gegen uns eingereichte Klage und die durch
Sie gegen uns erwirkte Einstweilige Anordnung zurückziehen bieten wir Ihnen an , Ihnen keine Einladung zu LiquidFeedback an die durch Sie in der Mitgliederdatenbank der Piratenpartei Deutschland hinterlegte E‑Mail - Adresse zu senden .
Zusätzlich werden wir auf Schadensersatzansprüche gegen
Sie verzichten .
Mit Verlaub , gehts noch ?!
Also wirklich , das meine ich ernst :
Das ist so dünn verborgene Erpressung , das geht gar nicht .
Zumal : Schadensersatz ?
Wofür ?
Wenn ich nicht genau wüsste , daß da auch haufenweise vernünftige Leute bei sind …
… trotzdem :
In was für einem Laden bin ich da eigentlich Mitglied ?
For instance , Mr. Bove pointed to last year ’s credit card bill , which led banks to push up rates pre-emptively or reduce customers ’ credit limits .
“ You ’re going to get a letter from your bank saying you now have to pay $ 1 to $ 15 a month to pay for this bill , ” he said .
“ The banks are going to get the money back because the consumer is going to pay for the bill , and that ’s the killer for the consumer . ”
Regarding a provision that limits banks ’ investments in hedge funds or private equity funds to no more than 3 percent of a fund ’s capital , Mr. Bove said : “ Who cares ?
They do n’t put more than 3 percent anyway . ”
John McDonald , a financial services analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein in New York , said there should be relief among investors , but the implementation would usher in a new phase of uncertainty .
“ There is still a long way to go in terms of getting clarity on the key issues that investors are focused on , like required capital , ” Mr. McDonald said .
Just take an issue like derivatives .
It is still not clear what activities the banks will need to cordon off in a separate holding tank .
Nor is it clear how much capital they will need , which is a major factor affecting the profitability of the business , he said .
One part of the legislation known as the Lincoln Amendment , for example , would demand the banks hold more capital .
At the same time , another part that drives derivatives trading onto clearinghouses and exchanges could lessen , in aggregate , the amount of capital that banks must hold .
“ There are a lot of variables in the air , ” Mr. McDonald noted .
Someone may soon be able to tell what types material are in your pockets from tens , and possibly thousands , of feet away .
Using terahertz remote sensing , detectors could see through walls , clothing and packaging materials and immediately identify the unique terahertz waves of the materials contained inside , such as explosives or drugs .
Until now , detecting terahertz waves – the portion of the electromagnetic spectrum between infrared and microwave light – has n't been possible from distances more than inches because the waves are absorbed by ambient moisture in the air , killing the signal .
" A lot of other researchers thought that terahertz remote sensing was mission impossible , " said physicist Jingle Liu of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute , lead author of the study published July 11 in Nature Photonics .
Liu 's team solved the problem by not relying on the terahertz waves themselves to generate or carry the signal back to the detector .
Instead , they used the reflection created by lasers pointed at the target .
Two lasers at different frequencies aimed at the target together generate a plasma ( basically excited , or ionized air ) .
This plasma emits a florescence that is scattered in characteristic ways by the terahertz radiation of the material it hits .
The reflection of the florescence is detectable from remote distances
The researchers have tested hundreds of different substances and created a library of terahertz spectra to compare to the signal from the target and instantly identify the material that was hit .
The researchers demonstrated that they could detect the signal from 67 feet away , the length of their laboratory space , but theoretically they could identify materials hundreds of feet or even miles away , Liu said .
“ Homeland security and military agencies have been struggling for years to get technology like this , ” said terahertz expert Abul Azad at Los Alamos National Laboratory .
“ I think the approach they have revealed is really , really unique . ”
The first application of this technology will likely be for the remote detection of roadside bombs , also known as improvised explosive devices ( IEDs ) by the military .
Homeland Security and the Defense Department were the primary funders of the research .
Terahertz detectors could also be used for airport security to detect illegal substances hidden in people ’s clothes .
The approach would be less invasive than x-rays , Liu said , because terahertz waves are much lower in energy .
It would not reveal anything concealed inside the body , because the terahertz signals cannot go through water , or metal .
Theoretically , Liu said , terahertz remote sensing could also be used identify the composition of an unknown toxic spill in the environment , or the composition of objects in space .

Researcher
As a researcher , I describe my work in various ways depending on who I am talking with .
In the official blurb , published in the College of Engineering handbook , I stress the system identification aspects of my work , and I ramble on about how we can hope to make a better world by understanding our machines and ourselves .
I sure hope that I 'm right about this .
For others , I stress the applications to signal processing and use words like " stability of algorithms , " " convergence analysis , " and " equalization . "
For others , I talk about the musical motivations lying behind my work and call it acoustical signal processing or perception based audio , where I have been investigating the relationships between the timbre ( or spectrum ) of a sound and the tunings ( or musical scales ) in which the sound will appear most consonant to the ear .
This has culminated in Tuning Timbre Spectrum Scale , published by Springer - Verlag ( the second edition is now out ! ) .
More recently , I have been investigating methods of detecting periodicities in data records , and attempting to automatically detect rhythmic structures in musical performances , as well as in other more prosaic signals such as heartbeats .
Rhythm and Transforms ( also published by Springer ) describes these investigations .
There are also links to many of my publications ( with all the self aggrandizement of a CV ! ) .
KANSAS CITY , Mo. – “ As a society , as a world , we can no longer continue our dependence on fossil fuels , ” Texas state Sen .
Rodney Ellis said at a workshop here at the NAACP ’s 101st Annual Convention on July 11 .
“ We make up about 5 percent of the world ’s population , ” Ellis continued , “ but we consume more than 20 percent of the world ’s energy .
When we talk about sustainability , that ’s not sustainable , that ’s not right . ”
In fact , the United States consumes more energy than any other country in the world .
“ Green jobs will be the wave of the future , ” said Ellis , a Democrat who represents Houston in the Texas Legislature .
“ We have to diversify our economy with clean sources of energy . ”
The workshop , titled “ Green Jobs : A Lifeboat in the Unemployment Storm , ” brought together political and community leaders from across the country to discuss the impact green jobs could have on communities of color .
The prospect of green jobs is especially important now – as an environmental issue and a jobs issue .
African Americans have been hit especially hard by the current economic crisis , with over 17 percent unemployment nationally .
Additionally , according to the Economic Policy Institute , unemployment for African Americans is expected to reach a 25 - year high this year .
Phaedra Ellis - Lamkins , from Green for
All , added that green jobs means “ recognizing that our communities deserve choices . ”
“ The economy is going to be rebuilt , ” she said .
“ The question is : are we going to participate in it ?
Will jobs be created in our communities ? ”
“ Some people , ” Ellis - Lamkins continued , “ do n’t think we deserve to be a part of the planning of the economy .
Well , the green economy is being created .
It is already 3 to 5 percent of the current economy .
But we have to fight for the opportunity to be included . ”
While stimulus money has created or saved millions of jobs , said Rinku Sen , executive director of the Applied Research Center , “ Black communities have been left behind . ”
Sen added , “ It is n’t enough for people of color to be a part of the environmental coalition .
We ca n’t be tokens .
We have to have the ability to influence the agenda , to influence the outcome . ”
Diversity and equality are not the same thing , ” she said .
Sen said people of color have to challenge people ’s “ dominant system of thinking , their frame .
We need the power to shift people ’s frame . ”
“ But that takes hard work , ” she added .
“ We have to organize , organize , organize !
There is no shortcut .
We have to talk to people and get them invested . ”
Congressman Emanuel Cleaver , D - Mo. , connected the need for green jobs with the health of the black community .
Cleaver , who grew up 300 yards from a landfill , said , “ Freeways and highways always come through minority communities .
We get the tail - pipe exhaust .
As a result , we have the highest rate of respiratory problems of any group in the nation . ”
“ We live in the oldest buildings and have the oldest homes .
We need to be leaders in the issue of sustainability , ” Cleaver continued .
“ We need weatherization .
This is our green future . ”
“ But , ” Cleaver concluded , “ we need a seat at the table . ”

From Virginia , Chris writes : " After [ Josh ] Tomlin kept the Yankees in check , it reminded me of a question I 've had for a while .
The Yankees seem to lose much more often when they face a rookie for the first time or a guy making his major - league debut .
Is there a way to find out about this : the Yanks ' OPS , BA , and W - L in these games ? "
Chris , my general take on questions like these is that we tend to remember the games in which the kid does well , and forget the rest .
Confirmation bias .
But I 'm always happy to look at the numbers .
Fortunately , we 've got them .
From The Captain 's Blog just this morning :
Last night , the Yankees lost to a pitcher making his major league debut , an all too common occurrence as any Yankee fan can attest .
In fact , the sight of a pitcher making his first start against the Yankees is enough to make those who follow the team let out with an audible groan .
Based on the results that often follow , one wonders if those in the lineup do the same .
Sometimes , perceived trends emerge in baseball , but in reality , they are really myths .
For example , the idea that Miguel Cairo is a clutch hitter who always comes up big can gain a life of its own .
Despite evidence to the contrary , what sticks out in most people ’s minds are events that defy expectations , so when a poor hitter like Cairo comes through , it becomes indelible .
Similarly , the notion that the Yankees never hit new pitchers is prone to the same effect .
Everyone expects the Yankees to pound the wide - eyed rookie , so when he turns in a strong outing , we all remember .
The only problem with that theory is the evidence actually supports the myth , at least with regard to pitchers making their major league debut .
I wo n't run the whole chart here , but we find that from 2001 through last night , starting pitchers making their debuts against the Yankees have a 2.32 ERA ... and the Yankees are just 3 - 8 in those games .
Meanwhile , over that same span , rookie starters making their debuts against non-Yankee teams have a 5.29 ERA .
Myth , indeed .
The explanation for that 2.32 ERA ?
We 've got two candidates .
Again , The Captain 's Blog :
One of the theories advanced for this strange phenomenon is the Yankees are a veteran team that is used to using their familiarity with a pitcher to out think him while at the plate .
Another reason put forth is the Yankees ’ resources allow them to accumulate an inordinate amount of scouting materials , but that advantage becomes mitigated when their is n’t as much history upon which to draw .
Duly noted .
I 've got two more candidates , though .
Sort of .
They 're caveats , really .
Caveat No. 1 : SMALL SAMPLE SIZE .
All those rookie starters who have fared so well against the Yankees ?
There are 11 of them .*
* Or 10 .
Kansas City 's immortal Eduardo Villacis , in his first and only major league appearance , got hammered .
None of the other 10 guys gave up more than three earned runs in their debut .
I 'm sorry , but 11 outings ( and 66 innings ) in 11 seasons simply is n't enough outings to merit more than a sideways glance .
I mean , seriously ...
We 're going to draw some grand conclusions based on 66 innings ?
On seven innings per season ?
You can .
I won't .
Caveat No. 2 : They did n't pitch as well as you think .
The data's in the chart , but the Captain 's Blog ignored it .
In those 66 innings , the rookies gave up only 46 hits , while walking 26 batters and striking out 34 .
They gave up two home runs .
You know what I think ?
I think they were ( naturally ) afraid to throw the ball over the plate and were hit - lucky and were homer - lucky and probably strand - lucky .
In six of the 10 non-Villacis games , the rookie struck out two or fewer Yankees .
Is that really good or really lucky ?
It would be a lot of fun if the Yankees ' $ 100 million lineup really was vulnerable to the fuzzy - cheeked kid just up from the Lickskillet League .
But the numbers -- not to mention every ounce of common sense I can summon -- suggest that they 're not , really .
A 60 - kilometre section of the Stuart Highway in South Australia will be closed for two hours next Sunday night to allow for the landing of an unmanned Japanese spacecraft .
The Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency is due to conduct the re-entry of the Hayabusa spacecraft in the Woomera Prohibited Area between 10:00 pm and midnight ( local time ) .
The highway will be closed between Cooper Pedy and Glendambo .

Es war eine der größten Entlassungswellen der WWE - Geschichte .
Zig Wrestlerinnen und Wrestler verloren im März ihren Job , als die weltgrößte Wrestling - Liga beschloss , dass sie mit einem Kahlschlag auf die Corona - Krise zu reagieren hatte .
Auch hinter den Kulissen gab es zahlreiche Kündigungen und vorläufige Ausbootungen durch Kurzarbeit .
Der Schnitt traf viele hart , zumal zum damaligen Zeitpunkt ungewiss war , wann andere Ligen wieder veranstalten und ihnen neue Arbeit geben können würden .
Mittlerweile haben viele ein neues Auskommen in der Branche gefunden - oder sind andere Wege gegangen .
SPORT1 gibt den Überblick , was die Opfer der Entlassungen heute machen .
Diese Stars landeten bei AEW : Nachdem bereits im Gründungsjahr 2019 diverse ehemalige WWE - Wrestler bei AEW unterschrieben , ebneten die Entlassungen weiteren den Weg : Der wohl größte Fang , den die von Milliardärssohn Tony Khan und einem Wrestler - Quartett um Cody Rhodes geführte Promotion machte : Rusev , der unter dem neuen Namen Miro bei der TV - Show Dynamite debütierte und in seiner Antrittsrede gleich ein paar Seitenhiebe auf WWE loswurde .
Ebenfalls bei AEW landeten Codys Kumpel Matt Cardona ( Zack Ryder ) , die frühere NXT - Wrestlerin Tay Conti und die bei WWE zuletzt als Trainerin angestellte Serena Deeb , einst Gefährtin von CM Punk in dessen Straight Edge Society .
Auch der langjährige WWE - Ringrichter Mike Chioda hatte einen Auftritt , Stand jetzt aber keinen Vertrag .
Auch das von Fans hochklassiger Tag - Team - Acton vielgelobte Duo FTR ( vorher : The Revival ) , das sich schon vor der Corona - Krise mit WWE auf eine Trennung verständigt hatte , ist nun bei AEW , hat Tag - Team - Gold errungen und steht weit mehr im Fokus als vorher bei WWE .
Die Impact - Riege : Das frühere TNA war lange erste Anlaufstelle für entlassene WWE - Stars , das hat sich durch die jahrelange Krise und den Aufstieg von AEW relativiert .
Nun landeten dort einige , die bei AEW eher nicht auf dem Radar gewesen sein dürften .
DAZN gratis testen und WWE RAW und SmackDown live & auf Abruf erleben | ANZEIGEBei der Veranstaltung Slammiversary gab es eine ganze Serie von Debüts : Heath Slater feierte nach 14 Jahren WWE - Zugehörigkeit ( und einer Abschiedsvorstellung gegen Weggefährte Drew McIntyre ) als Heath seinen ersten Auftritt , Curt Hawkins trat unter seinem richtigen Namen Brian Myers wieder für Impact auf , der bei WWE besonders schwach eingesetzte EC3 kehrte ebenfalls zum Platz seiner größten Karriereerfolge zurück .
Die größten Namen , die sich Impact schnappen konnte : AJ Styles ' langjährige Weggefährten Karl Anderson und Doc ( Luke ) Gallows , die Good Brothers .
Impact soll sie mit verhältnismäßig viel Geld und einem flexiblen Deal gelockt haben , der ihnen auch Ausflüge zu NJPW nach Japan gewährt , wo sie ihre größten Erfolge hatten .
Eine Rolle spielte aber auch , dass Anderson und Gallows AEW nach eigenen Angaben vergrätzt hatten , als sie im vergangenen Jahr trotz weit gediehener Verhandlungen doch noch einmal bei WWE unterschrieben .
Die beste Figur bei Impact machten bislang die ehemalige NXT - Wrestlerin Deonna Purrazzo und Eric Young , bei WWE Partner des Deutschen Alexander Wolfe in der Gruppierung SAnitY .
Die auch bei NXT nicht groß in Szene gesetzte Purrazzo hat den Damentitel bei Impact gewonnen , der Kanadier Young stieg beim langjährigen Arbeitgeber wieder zum World Champion auf .
Das machen die anderen Opfer der WWE - Entlassungswelle : Drake Maverick durfte trotz seiner Entlassung noch beim vorher angesetzten Turnier um den Cruiserweight - Titel von NXT antreten .
Durch seine Leistung während des Turniers und durch emotionale Social - Media - Posts konnte er WWE überzeugen , ihm einen neuen Vertag zu geben - auf emotionale Weise vor laufender Kamera .
Nun ist er Teil des NXT - Kaders .
Legende Kurt Angle \- aus seinem Job hinter den Kulissen entfernt - lehnte derweil ein Angebot ab , als dauerhafter Manager vom neu zu SmackDown berufenen Matt Riddle zurückzukehren .
Angle wollte sich aber lieber auf sein eigens gegründetes Unternehmen konzentrieren .
Dieses verkauft Nahrungsergänzungsmittel und Lebensmittel für Fitness - Begeisterte .
Aiden
English hat bisher noch keinen Vertrag bei einer Promotion unterschrieben .
Rusevs ehemaliger Vorsänger tritt seit September als The Drama King wieder im Independent - Bereich an und verfolgt andere Projekte - als passionierter Schauspieler , Sänger , Kunst - und Gaming - Fan hat er viele Interessen .
Ebenfalls schon in kleineren Ligen unterwegs waren Mike Bennett alias Mike Kanellis mit Ehefrau Maria und No Way Jose , der nun einen seriöseren Charakter mit dem Namen Levy Valnez vorgestellt hat , und Lio Rush .
Letzterer gilt mit seinem
Talent eigentlich als potenzieller Star , soll sich aber durch sein Verhalten hinter den Kulissen im Weg stehen .
Zuletzt kokettierte er mit einem Rückzug aus der Branche .
Keine entsprechenden Pläne haben Erick Rowan \- der sich nun in Erick Redbeard umbenannt hat - und Chris Hero ( Kassius Ohno ) , wobei beide seit ihrem WWE - Aus noch nicht im Ring aktiv waren .
Das Duo Primo und Epico ( Eddie und Orlando Colon ) ist wieder im US - Indy - Bereich und in der Heimat Puerto Rico bei der Liga WWC von Vater Carlos unterwegs , wie auch Primos großer Bruder , die frühere WWE - Hoffnung Carlito .
Ungewiss ist die Zukunft des früheren UFC - Schwergewichtschamps Cain Velasquez .
Die schönste Nachricht , die ein Entlassungsopfer seit März zu melden hatte : Sarah Logan verkündete , dass sie schwanger ist , der werdende Vater ist ihr noch bei WWE aktiver Ehemann , Erik von den Viking Raiders .
The Horror of D - Day A New Openness to Discussing Allied War Crimes in WWII
D - Day may have been the beginning of the end of Germany 's campaign of horror during World War II .
But a new book by British historian Antony Beevor makes it clear that the " greatest generation " was n't above committing a few war crimes of its own .
Posted by John , July 13th , 2010 - under Israel , Palestine , sanctions .
Tags : Apartheid
The spreading campaign for boycott , divestment and sanctions against Israel has the potential to focus the world ’s attention on the crimes against the Palestinian people argues a recent editorial in the US online magazine Socialist Worker .
ISRAEL ANNOUNCED an easing of its blockade of Gaza and charges against several soldiers who participated in Israel ’s 2008 - 09 assault on Gaza in a carefully timed move designed to placate critics one day ahead of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ’s meeting this week with Barack Obama .
But the new policy is far from the end to the blockade that human rights activists and international aid agencies have demanded .
Now , in the wake of Israel ’s assault on the Gaza Freedom Flotilla , the growing international solidarity movement–centered around a campaign for boycott , divestment and sanctions ( BDS ) against Israel–is gaining new allies and picking up momentum .
It deserves the determined support of everyone committed to seeing justice in the Middle East and around the world .
The immediate backdrop to the latest maneuvers is the deadly assault on a flotilla of ships carrying humanitarian supplies to Gaza .
Israel was left scrambling to contain the diplomatic fallout and the threat of further international isolation , as well as the first signs of diminished support within U.S. foreign policy circles .
To this end , Israel issued a list of items that it will ban from Gaza–a reversal of its previous policy of allowing in only items on a “ whitelist ” of approved imports .
Tony Blair , Britain ’s Middle East envoy , heralded the new policy as a major advance .
“ These changes are significant and , once implemented , should have a dramatic influence on the daily lives of the people of Gaza and on the private sector , ” said Blair .
But while Israel is lifting restrictions on most consumer goods , it is maintaining its ban on cement , fertilizer and steel unless Israel approves of the projects for which they are intended .
“ Can you imagine how many years it would take to negotiate [ the passage of ] the tens of thousands of truckloads needed to rebuild Gaza ? ” Sari Bashi , executive director of the Israeli charity Gisha , told Britain ’s Independent newspaper .
Israel also appears set to continue its ban on exports from Gaza , which has strangled the economy and led to unemployment rates of more than 50 percent .
Nevertheless , Obama emerged from talks with Netanyahu praising Israel for easing the siege and insisting that Netanyahu is serious about peace .
Never mind that a few months ago , Netanyahu declared Israel would never withdraw from critical areas of Jerusalem and the West Bank that for years have been seen as the basis of “ peace ” negotiations–and that he has categorically ruled out any apology to Turkey for killing nine Turkish citizens aboard the freedom flotilla .
Or that Avigdor Lieberman , Netanyahu ’s foreign minister , declared that there is “ no chance ” Israel will extend its freeze on settlement building .
Israel ’s siege of Gaza , settlement building , home demolitions , grab of Palestinian water resources , use of collective punishment and continued construction of a separation wall deemed illegal by the International Court of Justice amount to serial violations of international law .
These violations have gone on for decades , and the U.S. government has done nothing –except to bankroll and arm Israel to the extent that it is now in the front rank of the world ’s most powerful militaries .
– – – – – – – – – – – – – – – –
WITH THESE flagrant violations of international law–combined with the U.S. complicity that allows Israel to get away with them –what can be done to achieve justice for the Palestinian people ?
For the first time in decades , many Palestinian organizations and activists see a reason for hope :
Their longstanding call for a comprehensive BDS campaign against Israel is gathering momentum .
Modeling their campaign on the movement against South Africa ’s apartheid system in the 1980s –another rogue state that defied international law and violated the human rights of its citizens for decades –Palestinian civil society organizations turned to a BDS movement after the official international community failed to take any meaningful action against Israel .
What ’s more , the BDS campaign aims to address the demands of not just the 4 million Palestinians living under Israeli occupation in the West Bank and Gaza , but also the more than 1 million Palestinian citizens of Israel and roughly 4 million Palestinians living in refugee camps throughout the Middle East .
In the weeks since the assault on the Gaza flotilla , the BDS movement has chalked up a number of victories –large and small .
Last month , some 1,500 dockworkers at ports across Sweden refused to work with cargo to and from Israel , and a few days later , 1,000 activists set up a picket line at the Port of Oakland that was honored by dockworkers , preventing an Israeli ship from being unloaded for 24 hours .
In June , Britain ’s UNISON union , which represents some 1.4 million service - sector workers , passed a motion supporting “ an economic , cultural and sporting boycott of Israel ” in solidarity with “ the scores of unions around the world who have endorsed the Palestinian call for boycott , divestment and sanctions against Israel . ”
The motion further declared “ that as an immediate sanction for the illegal attack on the flotilla , we call on the government to expel the Israeli ambassador . ”
Also in recent weeks , a growing list of musicians has refused to play concerts in Israel .
Gil Scott - Heron canceled the Israeli stop of his world tour , as have the Pixies and Massive Attack .
Elvis Costello also canceled his upcoming two - day tour stop in Israel and issued a statement that reads in part :
One lives in hope that music is more than mere noise , filling up idle time , whether intending to elate or lament .
Then there are occasions when merely having your name added to a concert schedule may be interpreted as a political act that resonates more than anything that might be sung , and , it may be assumed , that one has no mind for the suffering of the innocent …
I cannot imagine receiving another invitation to perform in Israel , which is a matter of regret , but I can imagine a better time when I would not be writing this .
These victories follow on other campaigns that have been building for some time .
An early responder to the BDS call , the Presbyterian Church , began a phased divestment process against five companies in 2005 , and the Methodist Church followed soon after .
In early 2009 , activists mounted BDS campaigns on several U.S. campuses .
Students for Justice in Palestine at Hampshire College succeeded in pressuring the administration to divest from six companies complicit in Israel ’s illegal occupation .
More recently , the student body at Evergreen State College–alma mater of solidarity activist Rachel Corrie , who was killed trying to stop an Israeli bulldozer from demolishing a Palestinian home–passed two resolutions :
The first calls on the “ Evergreen State College Foundation to divest from companies that profit from Israel ’s illegal occupation of Palestine , ” and the second demands the school “ ban the use of Caterpillar , Inc. equipment from campus . ”
Caterpillar supplies Israel with the bulldozers used for house demolitions .
The student body at the University of California - Berkeley passed a resolution endorsing the divestment of university funds from General Electric and United Technologies , both of which profit from Israel ’s occupation .
But the student senate fell just one vote short of overriding an executive veto of the resolution .
Still , even when they have n’t yet succeeded in their specific demands , BDS activism exposes new groups of people to the reality of Israel ’s cruel treatment of Palestinians .
Thus , Code Pink ’s Stolen Beauty campaign to boycott Ahava beauty products , which are produced in West Bank settlements , has spread the message of the solidarity movement .
– – – – – – – – – – – – – – – –
THIS IS the reason that the global BDS campaign is causing Israel ’s defenders such heartburn .
Asher Fredman , a commentator for the Israeli newspaper Yediot Ahronot , characterized the BDS movement as a “ soft war ” against Israel .
As Fredman wrote :
In many ways , the number of campaigns which achieve their goal is less important than the perception that the movement as a whole is gaining ground .
This perception generates legitimacy for the soft war , entices others to jump on the bandwagon and can become a self - fulfilling prophecy …
The point that must be internalized is that the soft war constitutes not simply a nuisance or even an economic threat .
It is a process that could play a major role in shaping the future status quo between Israel and the Palestinians .
In the U.S. , home to Israel ’s chief sources of diplomatic , economic and military support , there is no shortage of opponents to BDS organizing .
For example , the American Israel Public Affairs Committee ( AIPAC ) has always vilified anyone who raises even mild criticisms of Israel .
But during the pushback against Berkeley ’s BDS activists , AIPAC was joined by its supposed rivals : J Street , a Capitol Hill - based lobbying group that sees itself as the peaceful alternative to the AIPAC hawks .
J Street , like other pro-Israel “ friends ” of the Palestinian cause , rejects the BDS movement as “ simplistic ” or even “ dangerous . ”
Instead , the group asserts that the issue ’s “ complexity should be reflected in the dialogue on campus , rather than singling out one side or another for condemnation and punishment . ”
In fact , J Street exposed what its formulation means in practice during the battle at Berkeley .
Working alongside Berkeley Hillel , the Anti-Defamation League , AIPAC , the Jewish Community Relations Council and Israel ’s consul general in San Francisco , J Street chose not to explore “ complexity , ” but joined in a campaign that included “ circulating anti-divestment talking points [ urging ] students to reframe the debate as an attack on the Jewish community and to avoid talking about the particulars of the Israel - Palestine conflict , ” according to a report on the BDS movement in the Nation .
Such tactics are typical of pro-Israel advocates : Deride advocates of Palestinian national rights for being simplistic , insist that there are two sides to the story , and label those who refuse to drop their criticisms as anti-Semites who are creating a “ hostile climate . ”
But there are n’t two equal “ sides ” in the Israel - Palestine conflict .
There is a colonizer and the colonized .
The growing BDS movement has the potential to focus the world ’s attention on Israel ’s repeated violation of basic human rights and international law .
Among those who advocate BDS , there are any number of political differences–about the nature of the Israel - Palestine conflict and its ultimate solutions ; whether Israel can be called an apartheid state ; whether to focus BDS efforts on only those Israeli enterprises and investments directly linked to the occupation of the West Bank or Gaza or to use a wider lens .
The strength of the movement will depend on these questions being posed and discussed while the different currents work together toward common goals .
As on so many issues , the U.S. population is far to the left of its elected representatives on this question .
While the vast majority of Congress signed an AIPAC letter supporting Israel ’s flotilla assault , a leaked survey by Republican pollster Frank Luntz found that only 34 percent of Americans backed the Israeli operation and only 20 percent of Americans “ felt support ” for Israel following its announcement that it would ease the siege of Gaza .
While the flotillas and land convoys to Gaza are set to continue this fall , the BDS campaign gives everyone an opportunity to participate in a movement against Israel ’s apartheid–wherever they live and whatever they do .
The movement to win justice for Palestinian national rights stands at a crossroads .
What happens next depends on our efforts .
As Martin Luther King wrote in his book Why We Ca n’t Wait : “ Freedom is never voluntarily given by the oppressor ; it must be demanded by the oppressed . ”
Our results demonstrate that , depending on the insertion event , a particular transgene can have large effects on the entire phenotype of a plant and that these effects can sometimes be reversed when plants are moved from the glasshouse to the field .
However , it remains unclear which mechanisms underlie these effects and how they may affect concepts in molecular plant breeding and plant evolutionary ecology .
The transgene increased the resistance to powdery mildew in all environments .
However , GM plants reacted sensitive to fungicide spraying in the glasshouse .
Without fungicide treatment , in the glasshouse GM lines had increased vegetative biomass and seed number and a twofold yield compared with control lines .
In the field these results were reversed .
Fertilization generally increased GM / control differences in the glasshouse but not in the field .
Two of four GM lines showed up to 56 % yield reduction and a 40 - fold increase of infection with ergot disease Claviceps purpurea compared with their control lines in the field experiment ; one GM line was very similar to its control .
We studied transgenic bread wheat Triticum aestivum lines expressing the wheat Pm3b gene against the fungus powdery mildew Blumeria graminis f.sp. tritici .
Four independent offspring pairs , each consisting of a GM line and its corresponding non-GM control line , were grown under different soil nutrient conditions and with and without fungicide treatment in the glasshouse .
Furthermore , we performed a field experiment with a similar design to validate our glasshouse results .
The introduction of transgenes into plants may cause unintended phenotypic effects which could have an impact on the plant itself and the environment .
Little is published in the scientific literature about the interrelation of environmental factors and possible unintended effects in genetically modified ( GM ) plants .
We therefore used the spring wheat variety Bobwhite SH 98 26 Triticum aestivum L. — transformed with the wheat Pm3b powdery mildew resistance gene [ 13 ] — as a model system to study potential transgene × environment interactions in genetically modified plants .
We grew four offspring pairs , each consisting of a GM line and its corresponding non-GM control line under different soil nutrient conditions and fungicide treatment in the glasshouse and the field .
Although well studied and not showing any abnormalities in the glasshouse , these plants had never been planted outdoors prior to our experiments .
We investigated to what extent the single inserted transgene could influence the disease resistance and overall fitness of our study plants and how these effects were modified by moving the plants from the glasshouse to the field .
Since the germination rate of our plants was close to 100 % ( S. Zeller , unpublished data ) , agronomical performance traits such as seed yield and seed number were used to indirectly assess changes in plant fitness [ 17 ] .
We asked the following questions : ( i ) Does the transgene enhance resistance to powdery mildew B. graminis f.sp. tritici ( DC . )
Speer and does it have other phenotypic effects such as fitness costs ?
( ii )
Do we find these effects in all transformed lines or is there line - specific variation ?
( iii ) Can intended and unintended effects of the transgene be influenced by environmental factors and are such effects detectable both in the glasshouse and in the field ?
We consider this study both as an example of how the ecological behaviour of genetically modified plants can be studied with experimental approaches and how such research can lead to insights into phenotypic effects of inserting a single gene artificially into a plant .
The widespread use of genetically modified ( GM ) plants in agriculture , together with the growing number of different crop species and introduced genes , demands sound environmental risk assessment [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] , [ 4 ] .
Following a tiered approach [ 5 ] , data from such preliminary risk assessment usually form the basis for extended field trials or lead to the rejection of GM plants from further testing at an early stage [ 6 ] .
Such studies often focus on the risk that a transgene may not show the desired phenotypic effect if the GM plants are moved from the controlled glasshouse environment to the more variable field conditions .
However , few studies have reported potentially unintended phenotypic effects of transgenes in GM plants exposed to a range of realistic environmental conditions [ 7 ] , [ 8 ] .
From evolutionary and ecological studies on wild plants it is well known that genotype × environment interactions can be large [ 9 ] , [ 10 ] , [ 11 ] , [ 12 ] , [ 13 ] , suggesting that similar interactions might occur in GM plants exposed to different environments , including glasshouse versus field environments .
Plant breeders know intuitively that plant performance needs to be tested in realistic agricultural environments and regulatory authorities demand such assessments in their guidelines [ 14 ] .
Recent studies compared metabolic composition and transcriptional changes in GM Maize grown among environments and in vitro and outdoors [ 15 ] , [ 16 ] .
They found that differences between GM and control plants in metabolic profiles observed under standardized laboratory conditions were lost in the field .
However , whether the same was true for ecological traits was not reported in these studies .
Furthermore , a careful search in the literature for replicated and randomized studies about the ecological behaviour of GM and control plants in glasshouse versus field environments did not return any published references .
In a factorial design , we grew the eight wheat lines under different fertilizer treatments ( three levels in the glasshouse and two in the field ) .
There were five blocks in the glasshouse and four in the field .
We analysed the data of both experiments separately and in combination by analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) .
The critical significance level was 0.05 in all analyses .
All quantitative pot data from the glasshouse were multiplied by 82.64 to equal an area of 1 m 2 .
Quantitative field data were divided by 1.08 for the same reason .
Regression analysis showed that two variables were slightly affected by the act of vandalism ( seed yield : R 2 = 0.167 and seed number : R 2 = 0.094 ; n = 64 ) .
We removed this effect by multiplying the data of the damaged plots with the negative slope from the regression analysis multiplied by the degree of damage ( for 10 % damaged area : seed yield : – 1.003 g ; seed number : – 20.8 ) .
We used the statistical software GenStat ( VSN International Ldt. ) to fit multiple regression models and summarize the results in ANOVA tables for all variables except powdery mildew infection ( see Tables S1 , S2 and S3 ) .
Residual plots were examined to identify outliers and to check if the assumptions of normality and homoscedasticity were fulfilled .
The vegetative mass of one unusually heavy plant was identified as an outlier and excluded from the analysis .
Phenological stage was transformed to the fourth power ( y 4 ) ; vegetative mass , seed yield and seed number were square - root transformed ; and ergot infection rate was cube - root transformed .
The binary mildew infection data were analysed using multiple logistic regression with analysis of deviance [ 30 ] .
We assessed the degree of powdery mildew infection [ 28 ] and the phenological stage [ 29 ] 80 days after planting .
Plants with visible powdery mildew colonies on all their leaves ( including flag leaf ) were considered infected .
We defined plant height as the highest point of the plant measured from the soil and recorded it at the end of the growing season .
For these three variables , powdery mildew infection , phenological stage and plant height , we used the maximum values of all tillers per pot or of the five marked plants per plot in glasshouse or field experiment , respectively , for analysis .
After ripening , all plants were cut at ground level and separated into vegetative and reproductive parts ( spikes ) .
These were then dried at 80 and 25 C° , respectively , and weighed .
We then threshed the reproductive parts , counted and removed the seeds infected by ergot ( only in field trial ) and obtained the total seed mass which is equivalent to the seed yield .
The seed number was calculated from the seed yield divided by the average seed mass .
The latter was determined on a sample of seeds , one spike in the glasshouse or 1,000 seeds from all spikes in each 1×1.08 m plot in the field .
The vegetative mass , seed number and seed yield were total measurements of all plants growing in a pot or a plot .
Ergot infection rate was calculated as percentage of seed number .
The natural field soil provided the plants with sufficient phosphorous , potassium and magnesium ( 80 , 235 and 234 mg kg − 1 ) .
All plots were sprayed with the herbicide cocktail Concert SX ( 40 % Thifensulfurone , 4 % Metusulfurone - methyl ; Stähler Suisse AG , Zofingen , Switzerland ) and Starane super ( 120 g l − 1 Bromoxynil , 120 g l − 1 Ioxynil , 100 g l − 1 Fluroxypyr - metilheptil - ester ; Omya Agro AG , Safenwil , Switzerland ) in the beginning of May .
In each plot , five individual plants were marked shortly after germination .
Powdery mildew and ergot Claviceps purpurea ( FR . ) TUL .
infection occurred naturally .
Vandals damaged 53 of the 64 plots at random by removing the tops of some plants early in the flowering stage .
The damage - induced loss of leaf area was within the natural variation observed in the field and smaller than the herbivory caused by Oulema melanopus L. ( cereal leaf beetle ) .
The damaged plots recovered within 2 –3 weeks and regained their original height and vegetative mass .
We recorded the exact area of damage within each plot and replaced all marked plants that had suffered damage ( 46.3 % ) .
A second field experiment with the same plant lines was carried out in an adjacent field the following year .
Although plants grew higher because of more favourable weather conditions , the different wheat lines performed very similar as in the 2008 trials ( S. Zeller et al. , unpublished data ) .
We are therefore confident that the here presented results and conclusions were not influenced by this disturbance .
The field experiment took place at an agricultural research station in Zurich - Reckenholz , Switzerland .
It started in March 2008 and lasted until August 2008 .
Four replicate blocks , each with sixteen 1×1.08 m plots , were sown with seeds of the same eight wheat lines as used in the glasshouse experiment .
In each plot , 400 seeds were sown in six rows with a distance of 18 cm between rows using an Oyjord plot drill system ( Wintersteiger AG , Ried , Austria ) .
Fertilizer was applied at the phenological stage 11 and 39 ( Zadoks et al. 1974 ) to half of the plots ( two times 3 g N m − 2 as “ Ammonsalpeter 27.5 ” , Lonza , Visp , Switzerland ) .
The glasshouse experiment took place in a climate - controlled glasshouse at the Institute of Evolutionary Biology and Environmental Studies , University of Zurich , Switzerland , from August 2007 to February 2008 ( day / night temperature : 21/16 C° ; additional light : 14 h/10 h day / night period , daily watering by hand ) .
Seedlings of each line were planted individually into 11 - cm square pots containing sterilized soil ( Ökohum lawn soil , Ökohum AG , Herrenhof , Switzerland ) .
The design consisted of the four GM and the four control wheat lines crossed with three soil nutrient levels ( 0 , 1 or 2 g of “ Osmocote exact mini ” per L ; Scotts , Waardenburg , The Netherlands ) .
One gram of Osmocote per L corresponded to 13.2 g N , 6.6 g P , 9.1 g K and 1.7 g Mg m − 2 .
Natural infection of the wheat plants by powdery mildew occurred 1 month after planting .
One half of the experiment was subsequently sprayed with a systemic fungicide specific to mildew ( 2 ml l − 1 Opus Top ; 83.7 g l − 1 Epoxiconazol and 250 g l − 1 Fenpropionazol ; Maag Agro AG , Dielsdorf , Switzerland ) .
The active ingredient epoxiconazol blocks fungal cell pathways and activates the plants pathogen defences whereas fenpropionazol blocks two enzymes that are related to the fungal cell - wall synthesis .
We used a high fungicide concentration ( 2ml/l ) ; this caused slight leaf chlorosis on several plants that disappeared after a few days .
All tested lines were affected equally .
Each of the 8×3 line - by - nutrient level combinations was replicated five times .
Plants were harvested 162 days after the start of the experiment .
We used four wheat lines carrying the transgene Pm3b in different position on the genome and their respective non-transgenic control lines ( null - segregants ) , each derived from different transformation events [ 18 ] , [ 19 ] .
Pm3b confers race - specific resistance to powdery mildew and was cloned from hexaploid wheat [ 13 ] .
The lines were generated by biolistic transformation of spring wheat variety Bobwhite SH 98 26 [ 20 ] .
The plasmids pAHC17 + NotI ( PMI ) and pAHC17+3NotI ( Pm3 b ) were used as vectors [ 21 ] , [ 22 ] .
After NotI ( for Pm3b ) or NotI / HindIII ( for PMI ) digestion , only the desired fragments , but no vector sequences , were co-bombarded into wheat .
The Pm3b gene was cloned under the control of the Zea mays L. ( maize ) ubiquitin promoter [ 21 ] and transformants were selected on mannose - containing media using the phosphomannose isomerase ( PMI ) - coding gene as selectable marker [ 23 ] .
After regeneration of T0 transformants , four independent T1 families were selected .
From each T1 family , an offspring pair was further propagated consisting of a homozygous transgenic plant ( GM lines Pm3 b # 1 –4 ) and a null - segregant , i.e. a plant that did neither inherit the Pm3b transgene nor the selectable marker ( control lines S3 b # 1 – 4 ) .
Absence / presence of the transgenes was confirmed by Southern hybridization analysis [ 24 ] using probes from the PM3B ( bp 1231 –1956 as referred to the GenBank accession AY325736 ) and PMI ( bp 271 –810 as referred to the GenBank accession AAC74685 ) encoding region .
The GM lines contained the Pmi gene as well as one complete copy of Pm3b , and in the case of Pm3b # 4 an additional fragment , which segregated as a single Mendelian locus in the T1 generation .
The null - segregants did not show any hybridization signal with the probes from the Pm3b as well as the Pmi coding genes .
For both transgenic as well as null - segregant lines we can not exclude the presence of fragments from the coding genes or promoter / terminator regions which were not covered by the probes used in Southern blotting .
The offspring pairs were multiplied to T4 and used for the glasshouse and field experiments .
The seeds used in this study were thus obtained from GM and control lines that had passed through four generations of sexual reproduction .
Studies with Drosophila melanogaster [ 25 ] and Saccharomyces cerevisiae [ 26 ] showed that a gene 's position on the chromosome can influence its expression .
We therefore assessed the expression level of the Pm3b transgene in the four GM lines by semi-quantitative RT - PCR using RNA isolated from leaves of seedlings grown in the glasshouse ( Figure S1 ) .
As control for equal amount and quality of template cDNA , the expression levels of the Mlo gene [ 27 ] were determined .
GM plants had a fitness advantage over control plants in the glasshouse , but a disadvantage in the field ( vegetative mass , seed number and seed yield : P< 0.001 , plant height : P< 0.05 for glasshouse / field × GM / control interaction ) .
While the differences between glasshouse and field could not be assigned to a single environmental factor , the different fertilizer treatments ( three levels in the glasshouse and two in the field ) did represent such a controlled environmental gradient .
We found that fertilizer had similar phenotypic effects in glasshouse and field environments .
To test if the observed differences in transgene effects between glasshouse and field were statistically significant we also analyzed the datasets from the two experiments together , considering the medium and high nutrient levels in the glasshouse as equivalent to the low and high levels in the field , respectively .
As expected , glasshouse and field environments differed significantly from each other .
Powdery mildew seemed to favour glasshouse conditions which lead to a stronger infection of the plants in the glasshouse than in the field ( P< 0.001 ) thus increasing the potential benefits of resistance caused by the transgene in the glasshouse .
Glasshouse plants developed more slowly ( phenological stage : P < 0.001 ) and invested slightly more into vegetative mass ( P = 0.042 ) but had fewer seeds ( P< 0.001 ) and lower seed yields ( P< 0.001 ) than field plants .
In the field , fertilization increased plant height ( P = 0.006 ) , vegetative mass ( P = 0.003 ) , seed number ( P< 0.001 ) and seed yield ( P< 0.001 ) .
The development of the plants ( phenological stage ) was not affected by fertilizer application .
Similar to the glasshouse , mildew infection increased with fertilizer application in the field ( P< 0.001 ) .
However , in contrast to the glasshouse , fertilization did not alter the difference between the GM and control lines in the field .
The four offspring pairs differed in seed number and their level of ergot infection ( seed number : P = 0.004 , ergot infection : P < 0.001 for main effect of offspring pair ) .
Effects of the inserted transgene differed among the four offspring pairs for the dependent variables powdery mildew resistance , ergot infection , seed number and seed yield as reflected in significant GM / control × offspring pair interactions ( Figure 3B ; powdery mildew infection : P = 0.022 ; ergot infection : P < 0.001 ; seed number : P< 0.001 , seed yield : P < 0.001 ) .
That is , in the field , yields of the GM lines Pm3b # 2 and # 4 were reduced by 56 % and 48 % , respectively , when compared with the corresponding control lines within offspring pairs .
The lines Pm3b # 2 and # 4 were completely resistant to powdery mildew in the field , whereas 12.5 % of the Pm3b # 1 and # 3 plants were infected .
The difference in ergot infection between GM and control lines was small in offspring pair 1 ( Figure 4 ) , moderate in offspring pair 3 , and large in offspring pairs 2 and 4 .
Seed infection rates of around 1 % , as found in lines 2 and 4 , can reduce grain quality .
The mildew infection equals the proportion of pots with strong powdery mildew infection up to flag leaves .
Phenological stage , plant height , vegetative mass , seed number and seed yield were measured to assess the plant performance .
A : mean of four lines at different soil nutrient levels ( circles = additional fertilizer , squares = no fertilizer ) ; transgene × fertilizer environment interactions were never significant ; light grey lines were drawn to make this visible ; error bars represent ± 1 standard error ( back - transformed , see methods ) .
B : proportional difference between GM and control plants for each of the four offspring lines but averaged across nutrient levels ( white bars = offspring pair 1 ( Pm3 b # 1 vs. S3 b # 1 ) , light grey = offspring pair 2 , dark gray = offspring pair 3 , black bars = offspring pair 4 ) ; x- axis log - scale with original values ( 100 * GM / control ) ; bars extending to the right from the vertical zero line indicate higher values in GM than in control plants ; significant GM / control x offspring pair interactions indicated by asterisks (* P<0.05 ; ** P<0.01 ; *** P < 0.001 ) .
We measured the same traits in the field experiment as in the glasshouse experiment .
In addition we recorded infection by ergot fungus , which occurred naturally in the field but not in the glasshouse .
Again , we compared first the four GM lines ( Pm3 b # 1 –4 ) with the control lines ( S3 b # 1 –4 ) , then the offspring pairs among each other and finally tested the interaction between these two main effects .
GM plants with the Pm3b transgene showed increased resistance to powdery mildew ( Figure 3A and B ; P < 0.001 ; see Table S1 ) .
In contrast to the glasshouse findings , GM plants had significantly fewer seeds and lower seed yield than control plants ( Figure 3A ; both P < 0.001 ; see Table S3 ) .
Phenological stage , plant height and vegetative mass were not affected by the transgene .
In the field , GM plants showed increased infection by ergot fungus compared with control plants ( Figure 4 ; P < 0.001 ) .
Fertilizer application in the glasshouse had positive effects on all traits except phenological stage ( Figure 2A ) .
Fertilization also increased mildew infection ( P = 0.016 ) which might be due to the increased growth rate of the host plant [ 33 ] .
Increased nutrient content of the plant material could have boosted the spread of mildew directly [ 34 ] .
Differences between GM and control plants generally increased with nutrient level ( vegetative mass : P = 0.035 , seed number : P< 0.001 , seed yield : P < 0.001 for fertilizer × GM / control interaction ) .
We currently have no explanation for this result which demonstrates the importance of testing effects of transgenes across a range of environments .
Depending on the offspring pair , the inserted transgene had significantly different effects on three of the measured traits ( Figure 2B ; vegetative mass : P = 0.012 , seed number : P< 0.001 , seed yield : P< 0.001 for GM / control × offspring pair interaction ) .
This suggests that unintended phenotypic effects of the transgene depended on the location where it had been inserted into the genome .
In absolute numbers , line Pm3b # 4 had the highest yield ( 4.19 tonnes per ha − 1 ) of the four tested GM lines and proved to be highly resistant to powdery mildew ( only 20 % of plants infected ) .
The four offspring pairs differed significantly from one another in the five fitness - related traits ( phenological stage : P< 0.001 , plant height : P< 0.001 , vegetative mass : P = 0.006 , seed number : P = 0.004 , seed yield : P = 0.014 for main effect of offspring pair ) .
Alternatively , we tested if there was a significant difference between the four control lines .
They differed indeed in all traits except the mildew resistance ( phenological stage : P< 0.001 , plant height : P< 0.001 , vegetative mass : P< 0.001 , seed number : P< 0.001 , seed yield : P < 0.001 for the contrast among offspring lines within control ) .
These differences may be caused by the callus culturing of GM and control lines or effects of the transformation itself .
Heritable effects acquired in cell culture can have a genetic basis and plants with such effects are sometimes used in plant breeding [ 31 ] , [ 32 ] .
The mildew infection equals the proportion of pots with strong powdery mildew infection up to flag leaves .
Phenological stage , plant height , vegetative mass , seed number and seed yield were measured to assess the plant performance .
A : mean of four lines ( Control = S3 b # 1 –4 ; GM = Pm3 b # 1 –4 ) at different soil nutrient levels ( circles = high fertilizer , squares = medium fertilizer , triangles = no additional fertilizer ) ; significant transgene × fertilizer environment interactions indicated by asterisks ( vegetative mass : P = 0.035 , seed number : P< 0.001 , seed yield : P < 0.001 ) ; light grey lines were drawn to make these interactions visible ; error bars represent ± 1 standard error ( back - transformed , see methods ) and are sometimes hidden behind the symbols .
B : proportional difference between GM and control plants for each of the four offspring lines but averaged across nutrient levels ( white bars = offspring pair 1 ( Pm3 b # 1 vs. S3 b # 1 ) , light grey = offspring pair 2 , dark gray = offspring pair 3 , black bars = offspring pair 4 ) ; x- axis log - scale with original values ( 100 * GM / control ) ; bars extending to the right from the vertical zero line indicate higher values in GM than in control plants ; significant GM / control x offspring pair interactions indicated by asterisks (* P<0.05 ; *** P < 0.001 ) .
The Pm3b transgene had the desired phenotypic effect and increased resistance to powdery mildew in the glasshouse experiment ( Figure 1 ; P < 0.001 for difference GM / control plants , see Table S1 ) .
The yield of the GM lines doubled ( from 1.60 to 3.23 tonnes per ha − 1 ) compared to the susceptible control lines .
GM plants had also more seeds and higher vegetative biomass than control plants in the glasshouse ( Figure 2 ; both P < 0.001 ; see Table S2 ) .
Phenological development and plant height were not affected by the transgene , indicating that these traits may be genetically more constrained than the other traits .
One half of the replicates in the glasshouse experiment were sprayed with fungicide to simulate environments with and without powdery mildew .
While the control lines benefited from the fungicide treatment , the GM lines reacted negatively ( P< 0.001 for GM / control x fungicide interaction ) .
The yield of the GM lines dropped lower than the yield of the sprayed control lines ( Figure 1 ) .
This indicates that the cost of resistance might be high if the pathogen is absent .
Furthermore , sprayed plants showed an acute stress reaction in form of chlorotic leaves .
We decided therefore to exclude the sprayed portion of the experiment from further analysis .
Discussion
Transgene × Environment Interactions
This study demonstrates that GM plants can differ in morphological , fitness - and pathogen - related traits from their control plants .
We found several significant transgene ( GM vs. control ) × environment interactions ; that is , depending on the environmental conditions the studied transgene against mildew infection had beneficial or detrimental effects on most of the investigated plant traits .
GM plants generally benefited from glasshouse conditions with high mildew infection pressure when compared with control plants but showed a stress reaction when powdery mildew was absent due to fungicide spraying .
It is possible that the GM plants lacked the energy to cope with the stress caused by this treatment or the chemical itself could have interacted with the transgene or with pathways involved in Pm3b - mediated resistance .
It is conceivable that the high fungicide dose increased the extent of the stress reaction of GM plants .
Similar to the fungicide treatment in the glasshouse , the natural conditions outdoors seemed to have stressed the GM plants in the field to the extent that their fitness was significantly reduced .
Possible causes of environmental stress in the field were drought and neighbour competition .
The only deliberately manipulated factor , i.e. fertilizer application , modified the transgene effects only in the glasshouse but not in the field .
Apparently the transgene only offered a relative fitness benefit to GM plants growing under conditions of high mildew incidence but low levels of other stresses .
These were exactly the conditions met in the glasshouse but not in the field ( nor in the glasshouse after fungicide application ) .
Under less beneficial conditions , the GM plants may have paid a physiological cost for the high intrinsic mildew resistance [ 35 ] .
Differences among GM Lines
The four GM lines , which each contained a single copy of the identical transgene in homozygous condition , differed significantly from each other .
There are several potential reasons for these differences .
It is possible that cell culturing caused somaclonal variation among the four offspring pairs which subsequently might have interacted differentially with the transgene [ 32 ] .
Although theoretically possible [ 36 ] we would not expect that such interactions would be stably inherited over five plant generations as we found it here .
It seems unlikely that random somaclonal events would cause similar effects in two of the four independently transformed lines ( Pm3 b # 2 and # 4 ) .
A more plausible explanation for the differential effects of the inserted transgene among the four offspring pairs may be that positional effects caused the line - specific differences .
Several processes are known to cause such effects [ 37 ] .
Firstly , an inserted transgene may disrupt native genes .
Because spring wheat is hexaploid , consists of more than 80 % repetitive , non-genic DNA sequences and each GM line was created by a single insertion event , it is unlikely that the disruption of coding genes or their regulatory sequences could have caused these differential effects [ 38 ] , [ 39 ] .
Secondly , the insertion position of a transgene into the genome may have affected its expression level .
Studies have shown that transgene expression rates and activity patterns of independently transformed wheat lines with constitutive ubiquitin promoters can vary [ 40 ] .
Depending on the insertion site , flanking DNA regions may partially silence the inserted promoter .
Head - to - tail arrangements of the transgenes , in our case of the Pm3b and the selectable marker gene , could also have a negative influence on the promoter activity [ 41 ] .
It is also possible that in some lines the transgene was inserted into a region of the genome with low transcription activity [ 42 ] .
The semi-quantitative expression analysis ( Figure S1 ) indicated that the expression of the Pm3b transgene did differ between the four GM lines .
Thus , although we lack confirmation by quantitative expression data , it appears that the two GM lines Pm3b # 2 and # 4 , where the transgene showed the strongest phenotypic effects , also had the strongest transgene expression .
Obviously , this hypothesis should be tested with a much larger number of lines differing in expression levels .
However , such a study currently would be beyond our capacities to obtain funding and permissions for field trials .
If the hypothesis could be confirmed , there would still be the question whether the overexpression of the transgene led to an overabundance of its protein product and the subsequent phenotypic effects or if other mechanisms would be involved .
Besides the quantitative reduction of fitness , we observed that some spikes of the two lines Pm3b # 2 and # 4 also differed in their morphology during flowering time and that the same two lines were also more heavily infected by ergot fungus than the other two GM lines and the four control lines .
The altered spike morphology may have increased the likelihood of ergot spores entering the florets [ 43 ] .
However , no indications of altered spike morphology were observed in the glasshouse .
Implications for Molecular Plant Breeding Although transgenic plant lines with unintended phenotypes commonly arise during molecular plant breeding [ 4 ] , [ 37 ] they can usually be detected earlier and more easily and are thus not further investigated [ 3 ] and published .
The development of commercial GM plants is based on long selection processes that start in the glasshouse and end in the field .
Enormous numbers of seedlings are already discarded before they are exposed to realistic field settings .
Our results may have implications for molecular plant breeding : some of the best GM lines in the glasshouse may still show aberrant performance in the field and some not so promising GM lines in the glasshouse may actually be the best for the field .
They would likely be lost at early stages of a selection process only targeted at maximum performance under a particular environment .
Based on our glasshouse findings , line Pm3b # 1 would have suffered this fate yet was the best in the field .
One lesson from our study and from genotype × environment studies in general [ 9 ] , [ 10 ] , [ 11 ] , [ 44 ] is that lines which perform particularly well in a specific environment may pay a cost of specialization and perform poorly in other environments .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Bank of America Merrill Lynch BAC.N has ordered its traders not to enter into oil trades with BP Plc BP.L that extend beyond June 2011 , a market source familiar with the directive told Reuters .

The order to the bank ’s traders came from a high - level executive and was made on Monday , according to a source familiar with it .
It told traders not to engage in trade with BP for contracts beyond one year from this month .
The directive did n’t state a reason for the limit on longer - duration trades with the oil company , which comes as the British oil giant scrambles to stop an oil spill in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico for which it could eventually face billions of dollars in economic liabilities .
Limiting the duration of trades with a counterparty is one way in which banks can seek to protect themselves against risk that a company will be unable to meet its long - term obligations .
A BofA spokesman declined comment .
BP spokesman Toby Odone said the company does n’t comment on market rumors or speculation .
The company 's U.S. - traded shares BP.N , which have plummeted around 47 percent since the disaster , rose 2.4 percent on Wall Street during Tuesday trading , then fell after the closing bell .
At 5:45 p.m. EDT ( 2145 GMT ) , BP 's shares traded at $ 30.66 , after closing at $ 31.40 .
Also after hours , a team of scientists appointed by the government to assess the flow - rate of the BP spill in the Gulf , boosted its estimate to as much as 60,000 barrels per day .
A source familiar with BP ’s trading operations said they have not been curtailed since the oil spill in April .
BP was n’t informed of any new trading limits with BofA , which is a relatively small player in oil markets and not among BP ’s top trading counterparties , the source said .
The source familiar with the BofA directive said it reflects a cautionary stance toward trading with BP .
However , the directive did not reference any reduction in overall credit volume the bank would extend to BP .
BP ’s credit rating was downgraded six notches on Tuesday by Fitch Ratings , which cited the high costs BP may face for compensating victims of the company ’s Gulf spill .
Fitch downgraded BP to BBB from an AA rating .
A source familiar with the BofA directive said it could include any trades in physical commodities , derivatives and swaps for crude oil and products .
The British energy giant ranks among the world ’s top oil producers and traders in physical energy markets and derivatives .
BP ’s Macondo well in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico continues to spill oil into the Gulf after deadly explosions sank the Transocean Horizon rig in late April .
The potential for soaring liabilities related to clean up costs , economic damages and legal penalties that BP could face after the Gulf spill has led some analysts and bankers to speculate that the oil giant may throttle back its trading operations .
Several fuel oil traders have recently resigned from BP , including four traders from its Singapore office last week , industry sources told Reuters .
Banks typically require companies like BP to put up collateral to back trades in the private derivatives market , though for highly rated firms such as BP , the collateral may be a small portion of the size of the exposure .
BP ’s credit default swap costs have surged in the past two months on increasing concerns over the company ’s credit worthiness , and traders and analysts have said some of the increase has come from banks hedging exposure to the oil company .
Credit default swaps are used to protect against the risks of a company or other borrower defaulting on its obligations , or to speculate on its credit quality .
BP ’s five - year CDS costs have jumped to 515 basis points , or $ 515,000 per year to insure $ 10 million for five years , from around 40 basis points in April , according to Markit Intraday .
BofA Merrill equities analysts maintained a “ buy ” rating on BP ’s London - traded shares on June 10 , but cut their price target to 575 pence a share , down from a previous 700 pence .
Russian Spy Anna Chapman Facebook Photos and Video
, a sexy 28 - year - old red - headed beauty , was among a ring of 11 Russian spies arrested and charged with conspiracy to act as an agent of a foreign government , and conspiracy to commit money laundering .
No low - profile operative , Chapman , who has a masters degree in economics , an online real - estate business and an apartment in the Financial District , courted the limelight , attending high - profile parties around Manhattan .
At her arraignment last night in Manhattan federal court , she was held without bail as a federal prosecutor called her a " highly trained agent " and a " practiced deceiver . "
Chapman was photographed partying at trendy events , and posted risque photos on her Facebook page .
A senior Russian spy who used the name Christopher Metsos served as a go - between for agents across the country , and was arrested this morning trying to board a plane in Cyprus .
The other suspects , including four middle - aged couples living seemingly ordinary professional lives , were supplied with bogus names and documents and told by Moscow to become " Americanized , " infiltrate " policy - making circles " in the United States and send secrets back to the Kremlin , the feds said .
Neighbors of the suspects were stunned .

NEWS OF suicide blasts at a Lahore , Pakistan , Sufi shrine , which promotes a moderate version of Islam , is unsettling ( “ Attack on Pakistani shrine leaves 35 dead , 175 wounded , ’’ Page A6 , July 2 ) .
Even more disturbing is the backdrop of terror attacks in the same city that killed at least 93 Ahmadi Muslims , another moderate sect within Islam , just over a month ago .
Both groups have been labeled as heretics by the Wahhabi school of thought because of their views .
During my visit to Pakistan in 2004 , I asked friends the question many Americans had asked after Sept. 11 , 2001 : Where are the moderate Muslims ?
Moderate Muslims were reluctant to comment due to fear of backlash .
Police rounded up innocent Christians under the guise of the blasphemy laws , boulevards displayed banners declaring minority Ahmadi Muslims to be worthy of death , and school curricula were littered with hatred against the Jews .
Moderate Muslims played it safe .
These recent attacks are a direct consequence of Pakistan ’s longstanding unwillingness to reform its legal and educational system and the reluctance of moderate Muslims to speak up .
So where are the moderate Muslims now ?
They are getting killed .

Eight music publishing organizations on Wednesday sued file - sharing site LimeWire for copyright infringement " on a massive scale . "
The publishing houses sued under the umbrella of the National Music Publishers ' Association ( NMPA ) , of which they are members .
They include EMI , Sony / ATV , Universal Music , Warner / Chappell Music , Bug Music , MPL Music Publishing , Peermusic , and The Richmond Organization .
The group is suing LimeWire , its chief executive Mark Gorton , COO and CTO Greg Bildson , and the M.J.G. LimeWire Family Limited Partnership for knowingly facilitating copyright infringement through its Web application .
The suit comes weeks after a Manhattan federal judge of 13 record labels and the Recording Industry Association of American ( RIAA ) , which also sued LimeWire for copyright infringement .
The RIAA wanted the site shut down immediately , but the judge said on June 8 that LimeWire for at least another two weeks .
At the time , LimeWire said a permanent injunction " could hold back the creation of new digital - music technologies that LimeWire is in the process of developing , "
The NMPA said its suit is being filed " as a related case " to the RIAA 's complaint .
" The pervasive online infringement facilitated by LimeWire and others like them has consequences for everyone in the music chain , " NMPA president and CEO David Israelite said in a statement .
" Operations like LimeWire must understand the songs that make their illegal venture lucrative do n't appear out of thin air .
Behind every song is a vast network of people  a songwriter , a publisher , a performer , a record label , " Israelite continued .
" They have robbed every individual in that chain by selling their site as an access point for music and then refusing to properly license the music . "
LimeWire said it welcomes the NMPA at the negotiating table .
" We definitely want publishers at the table , " LimeWire said in a statement .
" We have had many promising meetings with labels , publishers , songwriters and artists alike about our new music service and a business model that will compensate the entire industry .
Publishers are absolutely a part of that solution , and we 're hopeful that this action will serve as a catalyst to help us get to there . "

Forces have begun venturing out with Pakistani forces on aid projects , deepening the American role in the effort to defeat Islamist militants in Pakistani territory that has been off limits to U.S. ground troops .
The expansion of U.S. cooperation is significant given Pakistan 's deep aversion to allowing foreign military forces on its territory .

L’effort de fortification des Britanniques a débuté en 1800 après une nouvelle menace d’invasion américaine .
La construction des tours a débuté en 1808 .
Les trois premières tours ont été complétées en 1810 .
La quatrième tour fut complétée 2 ans plus tard , soit en 1812 , par manque de main - d’oeuvre disponible et due aux trop courtes saisons de travaux .
La structure d’une tour comme celle - ci est très solide .
L’armée britannique avait dû faire face à ce type de construction en 1794 à la pointe de Mortella en Corse .
Pendant 2 jours , la tour avait résisté à des bombardements de 2 navires équipés de multiples canons .
Les Britanniques furent impressionnés par la robustesse de cette tour .
Ils ont donc décidé d’en bâtir plusieurs un peu partout dans le monde et d’en copier l’architecture .
Toutefois , ils se sont trompé dans le nom en les nommant « Martello » au lieu de « Mortella » .
La tour no .
4 mesure 42,5 pieds en diamètre , elle est 26,5 pieds de haut et ses murs ont 6 à 11 pieds d’épaisseur .
La tour no .
1 est légèrement plus grosse avec un diamètre de 44,5 pieds et une hauteur de 29,1 pieds .
La tour no.
2 a donc un diamètre de 56 pieds et une hauteur de 33 pieds .
Les tours du centre , les nos .
2 et 3 , étaient plus grosses que celles à l’extrémité ( nos. 1 et 4 ) .
Les murs sont bâtis avec un mélange de pierre de calcaire disponible à Charlesbourg et Beauport et de la pierre de grès disponible à l ’Ange - Gardien .
La terrasse de la tour s’appuyait sur une chambre forte voûtée avec un énorme pilier central .
On pouvait alors y placer un lourd et puissant canon qui pouvait pivoter sur 360 ° .
L’assise de la tour était plus large pour améliorer sa solidité .
Un système de défense avancé
Les quatre tours ont été construites pour empêcher ou du moins ralentir l’envahisseur américain à atteindre Québec .
À cette époque , la Ville de Québec s’étendait uniquement à l’intérieur des fortifications .
Les tours étaient situés à environ un kilomètre de la Ville .
Les murs à l’ouest des forts étaient épais de 3,5 mètres ( 12 pieds ) du côté ouest et beaucoup plus minces du côté de la Ville ( 1,5 mètre ) .
Les murs épais étaient conçus pour résister aux boules de canon ennemies .
Les murs intérieurs étaient conçus pour être détruits facilement par les canons situés à Québec et dans les autres tours si l’ennemi en prenant le contrôle d’une tour .
En autres mots la terrasse du canon et la chambre voûtée n’étaient pas au centre du bâtiment .
Un fort autonome
Les tours ont été conçus pour être occupés pendant une lune ( environ un mois ) par une garnison de soldats .
La tour no.
4 pouvait loger 12 hommes .
Lors des changements de garde , les soldats sortaient et entraient de la tour par une porte au 1er étage et à l’aide d’une échelle amovible .
Cette dernière était alors hissée vers le haut dans la tour par les soldats pour éviter qu’un ennemi y mette les pieds .
Il y avait 2 quarts de travail .
6 hommes montaient la garde sur la terrasse de la tour au 2e étage alors que les 6 autres opéraient la tour ( bois de chauffage , cuisine , poudrière , etc. ) et se reposaient .
L’escalier étroit
Pour circuler entre les 2 espaces de travail , un escalier était construit à même le mur le plus mince .
Elle était très étroite et elle épousait la courbe du mur de la tour .
Un soldat en haut de l’escalier pouvait alors se défendre avec son fusil et se réfugier le long du mur pour éviter de se faire tirer en cas d’invasion .
L’espace d’entreposage et la poudrière
Le rez - de - chaussée avait une vocation plus utilitaire et d’entreposage .
On y entreposait la nourriture et l’eau grâce à de vastes réservoirs sous le plancher .
On pouvait hisser l’eau avec des chaudières grâce à des cordes rattachées au plafond voûté du 2e et à travers des trappes au plancher .
Le RDC logeait aussi la poudrière qui était isolée dans un coin dans sa propre voûte en pierre .
Jamais mise à l’épreuve
Lors de la guerre anglo - américaine de 1812 , les tours Martello de Québec étaient pleinement fonctionnelles et prêtes à recevoir l’ennemi .
Toutefois , lors de la bataille de Châteauguay le 25 octobre 1813 , les troupes de Charles de Salaberry ont défait les 4 000 troupes du major - général Wade Hampton et les empêchant ainsi de monter le fleuve Saint - Laurent et atteindre Québec .
La tour au fils des ans
L’emplacement des tours no .
3 et no .
4 à l’extérieur des champs de bataille les ont en quelque sorte isolés .
La tour no .
4 s’est fait enclaver dans un quartier résidentiel par le développement domiciliaire de la fin du 19e siècle .
Autrefois , située au bout du cap dans un champ , elle empiète maintenant sur la rue Lavigueur .
La Ville de Québec a construit la rue en faisant abstraction de la présence de la tour .
Les véhicules automobiles doivent la contourner puisqu’elle occupe la moitié de la voie de circulation comme le témoigne le plan de localisation de 1987 .
Démolition de la tour no .
3 en 1905
On est allé jusqu’à détruire une autre tour , la no .
3 , en 1905 pour permettre la construction du MacKenzie Memorial Building en 1906 de l’Hôpital Jeffrey - Hale lorsqu’elle était située jusqu ’en 1955 sur la Colline Parlementaire ( voisin du Grand - Théâtre ) .
L’emplacement précis de la tour est bien identifié sur Wikimapia .
Création de la Commission des champs de bataille nationaux en 1908
J’ai été incapable de voir un lien officiel entre la fondation de la Commission et les événements .
La Commission a d’ailleurs fait l’acquisition de la tour no .
4 en 1910 .
L’armée britannique possédait jusqu’alors l’équipement .
Fait étonnant , un gendarme de l’armée britannique a surveillé et habitué la tour avec sa famille de 1892 à 1907 .
Travaux de restauration
Les trois tours subiront des travaux de restauration en 1910 , 1937 , 1964 et 1992 .
Les travaux de 1964 comprenait des nouveaux planchers de béton pour remplacer les planchers de bois probablement pourris .
Les travaux en 1992 ont été très importants puisqu’ils comprenaient un nouveau toit , des travaux de mortier et un nouvel escalier extérieur et seules les tours 1 et 2 ont reçu des nouveaux planchers de bois .
D’ailleurs , elle fut la seule à ne pas recevoir un plancher de bois fidèle à ceux d’origine .
Les toits
La terrasse à l’origine n’avait pas de toit .
Le toit aurait été construit 11 ans plus tard en 1823 .
On constatait que l’eau et la neige endommageaient trop la maçonnerie et les pièces d’artillerie .
Les premiers toits étaient bas .
Le dernier toit reconstruit en 1992 offre un bon dégagement pour les occupants .
La tour no .
4 aujourd ’hui
Cette tour ne fait pas partie du circuit touristique dû à son emplacement peu accessible .
Elle n’est pas exploitée par la Commission des champs de bataille nationaux .
Elle demeure la propriété de la Commission qui a la responsabilité de son entretien et sa surveillance .
Le CCBN n’a pas de plans futurs pour la tour autre que le statu quo .
Elle ne contient aucun bien ou artefact de l’époque .
Elle est entièrement vidée de son contenu historique .
Son foyer est condamné et les pièces d’artillerie sont toutes retirées .
Son canon principal , autrefois installé sur le toit , a été déménagé et installé sur les Plaines d’Abraham sur l’avenue Tâché .
D’ailleurs , les agents de sécurité de la CCBN font régulièrement des tournées sur la rue Lavigueur .
La sécurité est assurée par le Corps canadien des Commissionnaires qui rendent des services dans la plupart des sites et édifices du gouvernement fédéral .
Les Compagnons de l ’ère médiévale depuis 1996
Une association d’adeptes de l’époque médiévale a pris son envol après les fêtes des médiévales de 1993 et 1995 .
La Ville de Québec s’est entendue avec la Commission des champs de bataille pour prêter la Tour Martello no .
4 à ce groupe en 1996 .
L’entente s’est renouvelée plus officiellement en 2008 avec la CCBN directement .
Les Compagnons sont en sorte les gardiens de la tour .
Ils ont la responsabilité de veiller sur elle et l’occuper .
Elle serait autrement vide et pas surveillée .
Ils défrayent aussi le coût des assurances habitation qui atteignent les 2 500 $ par année due à la particularité du bâtiment .
La Commission a toutefois la responsabilité de la préservation des lieux , des coûts en électricité et de l’entretien du bâtiment .
Aujourd ’hui , l’association regroupe 20 bénévoles qui organisent des soupers banquets avec une thématique médiévale au 2e étage ( la terrasse recouverte du toit ) .
Le bâtiment est leur lieu de rencontre et il sert à entreposer leurs costumes et accessoires .
Ils doivent être discrets par respect au voisinage qui est à proximité .
Ils s’imposent un couvre - feu de 23 h pour toutes leurs activités en soirée .
D’ailleurs , l’ex - président de l’association , André Chagnon , et une des administratrices , Huguette Desroches ont permis à Francis Vachon et moi de faire une visite complète de la tour .
Nous les remercions pour leur accueil inconditionnel .

Faits intéressants
Lors de notre visite , il faisait un écrasant 30 ° avec beaucoup d’humidité .
Une fois rendu à l’intérieur , on aurait cru avoir changé de saison .
C’était très confortable tout en restant assez humide .
Malgré que la tour est officiellement fermée au public , les Compagnons sont très accueillants et vous êtes les bienvenus à visiter la tour lorsqu’ils sont sur place .

There are a couple interesting threads ( disclaimer I inadvertently started one ) going on over on the Open Library technical discussion list about making Linked Data views available for authors .
Since the topic was largely how to model people , part of the discussion spilled over to foaf - dev ( also my fault ) .
When making library Linked Data available my preference has been to follow the lead of Martin Malmsten , Anders Söderbäck and the Royal Library of Sweden by modeling authors as People using the FOAF vocabulary :
< http://libris.kb.se/resource/auth/317488>
libris:key " Berners - Lee , Tim " ; a foaf : Person ; rdfs:isDefinedBy < http://libris.kb.se/data/auth/317488> ; skos:exactMatch < http://viaf.org/viaf/23002995> ; foaf : name " Berners - Lee , Tim " , " Lee , Tim Berners - " , " Tim Berners - Lee " , " Tim Berners - Lee " .
It seems sensible enough right ?
But there is some desire in the library community to model an author as a Bibliographic Resource and then relate this resource to a Person resource .
While I can understand wanting to have this level of indirection to assert a bit more control , and to possibly use some emerging vocabularies for RDA , I think ( for now ) using something like FOAF for modeling authors as people is a good place to start .
It will engage folks from the FOAF community who understand RDF and Linked Data , and get them involved in the Open Library Project .
It will make library data fit in with other Linked Data out on the web .
Plus , it just kind of fits my brain better to think of authors as people …is n’t that what libraries were trying to do all along with their authority data ?
I ’m not saying that FOAF will have everything the library world needs ( it wo n’t ) , but it ’s an open world and we can add stuff that we need , collaborate , and make it a better place .
Anyway , that ’s not really what I wanted to talk about here .
Over the course of this discussion Erik Hetzner raised what I thought was an important question :
Are you saying that there is a usable distinction between : a bibliographic record , and
the data contained in that bibliographic record ?
From above , my first notion would be to model things as , in
pseudo - Turtle : : < Victor Hugo > a frbr : Person .
< Victor Hugo > rdfs:isDefinedBy < bib record > .
< bib record > dc:modified “ … ” ^^xsd : date .
But it seems to me that you are adding a further distinction : : < Victor Hugo > a frbr : Person .
< Victor Hugo > rdfs:isDefinedBy < bib record > .
< bib record > rdfs:isDefinedBy < bib record data >
< bib record data > dc:modified “ … ” ^^xsd : date .
Is this a usable or useful distinction ?
Are there times when we want to distinguish between the abstract bibliographic record and the representation of a bibliographic record ?
In linked data - speak , is a bibliographic record a non-information resource ?
My thinking has been that a bibliographic record is an information resource , and that one does not need to distinguish between ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) above .
I think it ’s an important question because I do n’t think it ’s been really discussed much before , and has a direct impact on what sort of URL you can use to identify a Bibliographic Record , and what sort of HTTP response a client gets when it is resolved .
This is the httpRange - 14 issue , which is covered in Cool URIs for the Semantic Web .
If a Bibliographic Record is an Information Resource then its OK to identify the record with any old URL , and for the server to say 200 OK like normal .
If it ’s not an Information Resource then the URL should either have a hash fragment in it , or the server should respond 303 See Other , and redirect to another location .
In my view if a Bibliographic Record is on the web with a URL , it is useful to think of it as an Information Resource …or ( as Richard Cyganiak dubs it ) a Web Document .
I do n’t think it ’s worthwhile philosophizing about this , but instead to think about it pragmatically .
I think it ’s useful to consider
as being an identifier for a bibliographic record that happens to be in HTML .
Likewise
are all identifiers for Bibliographic Records in MODS , Dublin Core and MARCXML respectively .
It might be useful to link them together as they are with < link > elements in the HTML , or in some RDF serialization .
It also could be useful to treat one as canonical , and content negotiate from one of the URLs ( e.g. curl –header “ Accept : application / marc+xml ” http://lccn.loc.gov/99027665).
But I think it simplifies deployment of library Linked Data to think of bibliographic records as things that can be put on the web as documents , without worrying too much about httpRange - 14 .
A nice side effect of this is that it would grandfather in all the OPAC record views out there .
Maybe it ’ll be useful to distinguish between an abstract notion of a bibliographic record , and the actual document that is the bibliographic record – but I ’m not seeing it right now …and I think it would introduce a lot of unnecessary complexity in this fragile formative period for library Linked Data .
There 's a story that goes with this picture .
I 'm sitting in the bar at Torcon after the Hugos in my snazzy suit , having just discovered that my story 0wnz0red missed making the Hugo ballot by four lousy nominations and therefore enjoying an unaccustomed glass of Irish whisky when Craig Engler comes up with a camera and says , " Give me the finger ! "
I gave him the finger .
He took my pic .
" Craig , " I said .
" Why did I just give you the finger ? "
" It 's not my camera , " he said , and went off to someone else and said , " Hey , give me the finger ! "
Post - Hugo - Ceremony at the bar is always a pretty emotional timespace .
I 'd gotten very miffed at the people sitting in front of me who'd turned around and glared at me every time I cheered and applauded while the nominee and winner names were read out ( I mean , honestly , what kind of person goes to an awards ceremony prepared to act like a giant buzz - kill to anyone nearby who cheers and applauds ? ) , and that combined with the so - close - and - yet - so - far revelation about 0wnz0red was enough that my finger here is more genuine than fanciful .
As it turns out , the camera belonged to Scott Edelman , the first professional editor to publish one of my stories and one of the nicest guys I know .
Scott 's gallery of Craig 's pix of birds - being - flipped after the Hugos is actually pretty funny .
There 's a lot of truth revealed in people 's facial expressions when you send them to an awards ceremony whose fruits they all aspire to , then pour a couple drinks down them , then ask them to make a rude gesture .
Just saying .

The property industry is calling for the creation of a federal Minister for Urban Affairs to improve the planning of Australia 's capital cities .
An industry - commissioned report has found that inconsistent and contradictory planning approaches are delaying the development of cities .
The report also ranks the planning approaches of state governments , finding Adelaide the best and Sydney the worst .
The chief executive of the Green Building Council of Australia , Romilly Madew , says governments must improve planning now .
" What the report highlighted was that there is an inconsistent approach across a number of different criteria .
So cities may have a strong planning regime but then that does n't support population growth or environmental issues , " she said .
" Cities need a holistic approach to the way they deal with planning .
" Not one city was marked well in holistic approach across the whole strategic planning of our cities , " she added .
" So if you think about how we get to work , where we are building our buildings , but then also the issues of climate change and infrastructure , there was no consistency - all the departments deal individually rather than working together . "
Ms Madew says the report has found that current approaches to planning will not meet future needs .
Opposition MPs are ridiculing the Conservative government for spending almost $ 2 million to create an artificial indoor lake and cottage backdrop inside a Toronto media centre for this month 's G8 and G20 summits .
Summit organizers are constructing the artificial lake inside Toronto 's Direct Energy Centre to showcase the actual site of the G8 summit hundreds of kilometres away in Huntsville , Ont. , June 25 - 26 .
The temporary media centre will host all but about 150 of the estimated 3,000 journalists from around the world covering the G8 , as well as the G20 summit in Toronto 's downtown core June 26 - 27 .
Opposition parties have targeted Prime Minister Stephen Harper 's government in recent weeks over the costs of the back - to - back international summits , which carry an estimated $ 1 - billion price tag on security alone .
During Monday 's question period in the House of Commons , Liberal MP Mark Holland asked why the Conservatives would " splurge " on an indoor lake during meetings where Canada will be preaching fiscal restraint to the rest of the world .
" The government is literally going to flush it down the drain when the 72 - hour spend - fest is over , " Holland told the House .
Speaking for the government , Foreign Affairs Minister Lawrence Cannon replied it is normal for summit host countries to showcase " all their country has to offer " to visiting media .
" We 're going to be proud to showcase Canada to the world , contrary to what the Liberals want to do , " Cannon said .
Liberal Leader Michael Ignatieff labelled the dual summits " the world 's most expensive photo - op , " citing a leaked G8 communiqué that he said showed no progress on maternal health , climate change or the environment .
On the issue of banking reform , Ignatieff said it appeared that all decisions would be left for another G20 summit in Korea at the end of the year .
Cottage scene includes canoes , deck chairs
Bloc Québécois Leader Gilles Duceppe labelled the G8 meeting a " tourist event , " while NDP Leader Jack Layton called it a " billion - dollar boondoggle that is ballooning " under the Conservatives ' wasteful mismanagement .
" We 've got a government here that has to create an artificial lake , when Canada has more lakes than just about any other country in the world , " Layton told the House .
" It 's the taxpayers who are going to end up at the bottom of the fake lake , with a fake Muskoka behind them . "
But Transport Minister John Baird said the government has made a strong commitment to working multilaterally with international partners and is proud to showcase Canada as a " magnet for jobs , investment and opportunity .
" Only the leader of the Liberal Party would think it would be a waste of time of getting the G8 leaders together , the G20 leaders together , to plan on what we can do to revive economic growth in this country , " he said .
The Toronto Sun reported the planned lake site — part of a larger " Canadian corridor " at the media centre — includes mocked - up canoes and Muskoka chairs , as well as large flat - screen televisions showing scenes of Muskoka 's cottage country .
The Council of Canadians , an advocacy group opposed to Canada as host of the G8 and G20 summits , said Monday it has applied to the Geographical Names Board of Canada to have the temporary body of water named " Harper ’s Folly . "

AN Adelaide woman embroiled in Australia 's most expensive divorce is suing her former lawyers , claiming their multi-million dollar legal bill is " unfair and unreasonable " .
In documents filed with the Supreme Court , the woman - who cannot be named - claims she has paid $ 10.5 million in legal fees since her " extremely complex " divorce proceedings began in 2005 .
She has asked the court to intervene in a $ 4.3 million bill , issued by one city law firm for its services .
She says the firm 's staff generated 23,000 documents and 480,000 computer files about her case - filling 182 archive boxes .
Her estranged husband , she claims , has spent $ 26 million for representation over the same period .
The woman has asked the court to review her bill and determine how much she should have been charged for the firm 's work .
" Throughout the ongoing conduct of the ( divorce ) action I have become extremely concerned and stressed as to the amount of legal fees and disbursements I have incurred , " she says in an affidavit filed by her new lawyers .
" I have exhausted nearly all my available funds and only have nominal funds to live on and ( for ) the day - to - day care of my son . "
It is understood the woman is seeking a multi-million dollar property settlement , and millions in child support , from her husband .
In her affidavit , the woman admits her divorce has been " extremely complex " .
She says that in December 2007 , her then - lawyers wrote to her saying they " could not continue to act " unless she deposited $ 750,000 into their trust account .
She claims that in March 2008 , she was told her outstanding legal fees totalled $ 650,000 .
She says she terminated her dealings with the firm in April 2008 but , one month later , learnt it had $ 926,653.93 of her money in its trust account .
The woman says she needs the court 's help due to " what appear to be discrepancies " in her account statements .
" I have repeatedly requested ... a final tax invoice for my consideration , " she says .
" To date , I have not received a bill of costs in taxable form . "
In its defence papers , the firm denies it has been unfair or unreasonable .
It says the woman was " fully informed " that " not all lawyers charged on the same basis " .
It claims she wanted to " maximise the chance of a successful outcome " of her divorce .
She was therefore charged for " the level of legal resources needed to conduct the matter thoroughly " .
At a hearing last month , the firm asked the woman be ordered to disclose all correspondence she 'd had with other lawyers .
Judge Robert Lunn refused the application .
" For many years , ( the woman ) has been involved in a mammoth and bitter divorce case , " he said .
" Whether she has spent $ 10 million or $ 15 million is not the basis of the argument .
" It is , in colloquial terms , whether she has scraped the bottom of the barrel in pursuing her claim ( and ) this seems to be beyond argument .
" Hence , I do not consider she should be put to the time , trouble and expense of having to ( disclose ) all the documents ... for all the legal and related expenses she has incurred in this long and complex case . "
The matter returns to court next week .
Two teams of researchers from New England have built living , breathing lung tissue in the laboratory — feats of engineering that could speed up the development of new drugs and bring researchers a step closer to the tantalizing dream of growing replacement lungs for patients .
Both achievements , described in reports published yesterday by Harvard and Yale scientists , are part of broader efforts among researchers to build a range of organs , from the heart to the liver .
Such research could provide powerful tools to test drugs and identify toxins , and eventually grow new tissue to repair damaged organs .
Harvard scientists re-created a critical area of lung tissue on a silicon rubber chip the size of a quarter , and found that it responded to bacteria and tiny particles carried in the air just like a living lung .
Using a different approach , Yale University researchers regenerated lungs and transplanted them into rats , where they functioned successfully for up to two hours .
This work is not the first successful effort to build functional tissue .
In the late 1980s , researchers first began to apply engineering approaches to human tissue , and advances have begun to work their way into the clinic — most notably in advances in artificial skin .
But the two new studies are significant milestones in the quest to build a functional organ in the lab — although it will still be many years yet before doctors reach the science fiction dream of regenerating lungs to help patients .
More immediately , the benefits of the new work could be seen in allowing pharmaceutical companies to test drugs on a tiny , cheap chip that closely resembles the complexity of the human body .
The “ lung is pretty tough [ to replicate ] .
It ’s also pretty important — people get lung cancer , and lots of people get lung diseases that are pretty serious , ’’ said Robert Langer , a professor at MIT who was not involved in either group ’s research .
Langer said the new techniques also could provide a substitute for animal testing .
For years , scientists have tested drugs using cells in a dish and lab animals .
But many organs have layers of complexity that simply can not be replicated with current models , and drugs that show promise in mice often do not pan out as cures in humans .
The lung contains an intricate branching architecture of airways , blood vessels , and hundreds of millions of tiny sacs , called alveoli , where gases are exchanged .
And the cells move and are stretched with each breath .

A Trip to the Dawn of the Dead Shopping Mall
Since we visited the Night of the Living Dead cemetery , we decided to also make a stop at the mall in Monroeville , PA , seen in Dawn of the Dead ( 1978 ) .
This video ’s a little more crude .
Since we were shooting in a mall , we went guerilla - style with this one .
Anyone seen the Mall Tour bonus feature on the Dawn of the Dead DVD ?
The one where Ken Foree ’s giving a tour of the mall , shot by a distant handheld camera .
You can barely hear him .
It ’s pretty sloppy .
Ours is slightly better .
Los Angeles , California ( CNN ) --
Playing high - profile video games quickly from portable devices such as your iPad might get easier after this week 's Electronic Entertainment Expo .
While the E - 3 " game changer " tag has been reserved largely for innovations such as 3 - D and motion - sensor systems , several companies hope using cloud computing to store games will be the real shift by letting gamers play high - end titles anywhere , on almost any machine .
If fully realized , they say , cloud gaming could be a console killer .
Gaming company OnLive announced Tuesday that it will make 23 popular console games , including " Assassin 's Creed II , " " Batman : Arkham Asylum " and " Mass Effect 2 , " available through an online subscription service .
" Today we 're taking the first step toward a future where video game content is increasingly free from the restrictions of device and location , while showcasing the ability to instantly play the latest , most advanced games at the touch of a button , " said OnLive founder and CEO Steve Perlman .
Cloud gaming uses rapid data compression to let users store their games " in the cloud " -- on Web servers -- and then pull them down and play them using a regular Web browser .
It 's the same concept as storing photos on a site such as Flickr or music videos on a MySpace page .
The user does n't actually have those files on any one particular computer but can access them from anywhere .
OnLive has partnerships with gaming companies such as Electronic Arts , UbiSoft and Warner Bros .
Interactive and announced several new ones , including Sega , on Tuesday .
More titles were expected to be available as they are released .
OnLive 's service , which launches Thursday , will offer free subscription for a year .
OnLive has not announced what fees will be beyond that , but a spokesperson said Wednesday they will be " much less " than $ 15 a month .
OnLive is n't the only one in the cloud - gaming business though .
Rival Gaikai announced this year it had raised $ 10 million for a streaming game service that will let users sample games before buying them .
" [ W ]e host the games , we run them , we worry about hardware and software updates , and we stream them to you , " Gaikai said on its website .
" The only thing you need is a browser and an internet connection . "
Also at E3 , Sony announced PlayStation Plus , an online subscription service that expands its PlayStation Network .
Launching on June 29 , the pay service will offer gamers a chance to play exclusive and preview versions of top games , ramping up Sony 's bid to compete with the Xbox Live network from Microsoft .
A 90 - day subscription to the service will cost $ 17.99 and will go for about $ 50 a year .
And billionaire Sir Richard Branson made the space even more interesting Tuesday with the rollout of Virgin Gaming -- an online home for competitive console gamers .
The subscription site will host top - line games that gamers would typically buy for themselves .
" With Virgin Gaming , we 're offering members more than just a place to compete .
We 're offering them the best , safest and most secure online experience with the fresh , fun approach Virgin is known for , " said Rob Segal , CEO of Virgin Gaming .
In his typical , bigger - than - life style , Branson pulled up at E3 in an armored car purportedly carrying $ 1 million -- representing the total payout for a series of cash prizes Virgin will pay in competitive tournaments hosted on the site .
The cloud - computing concept had insiders talking at E3 -- which started Tuesday and runs through Thursday .
But not everyone in the tech community is sold just yet .
Some question whether gamers , who presumably already have at least one gaming console , will pony up again for the ability to play their favorite titles from the cloud .
" Even if it costs less to rent or play a game -- and it probably will ...
OnLive will have a tough time competing with actual hardware for all but the most dedicated gamers , " Jared Newman wrote on the Technologizer blog .
A handheld electronic device comprising : a housing ; an electronic paper display disposed in the housing and having a first surface area ; and a liquid crystal display ( LCD ) disposed in the housing proximate the electronic paper display , the LCD having a second surface area that is smaller than the first surface area of the electronic paper display .
Looks like the battle for e-reader dominance between Amazon and Barnes & Noble could soon expand beyond the recent spate of price drops and into the courtroom as well : the USPTO just granted a 2006 Amazon patent on e-readers with secondary LCD displays ( like the original Kindle 's scroller - navigation panel ) , and several of the claims are potentially broad enough to cover the Nook and many other devices with both electronic paper and LCD displays .
What 's more , Amazon agreed not to file for any corresponding foreign patents during the four - year approval process and thus was n't required to publish the patent application -- meaning this is likely a complete surprise to the entire industry .
Yeah , it 's juicy .
Here 's one of the claims that could cause problems for Barnes & Noble -- in plain English , it potentially covers any device with both an electronic paper display and a second smaller LCD display next to it .
That 's pretty sweeping -- it does n't take much to look at the Nook and see that it has both an electronic ink display and a smaller LCD located next to it .
Now , we do n't know if Amazon has any plans to actually sue anyone over this patent yet , but we 're guessing there 's a flurry of legal activity happening at all the major e-reader manufacturers right now , and we 're definitely curious to see what the fallout looks like -- remember , Barnes & Noble is already involved in a trade secret dispute over the Nook with Spring Design , which claims that B &N saw its
Alex reader under NDA and then copied it for the Nook .
That case is n't scheduled to wrap up before November , so there 's a chance B&N and Spring Design could end up simultaneously fighting each other in one case while taking on Amazon as allies in another , which would be ... messy .
We 'll see what happens -- while we 've no doubt Barnes & Noble will put up a serious fight if it comes to that , we 're curious to see if the shift away from e-reader development to general - use tablets hastens as the market contracts , margins shrink , and the cost of litigation becomes prohibitive .
The ball 's very definitely in Amazon 's court now -- stay tuned .

A protester wields a bottle filled with brown liquid during Tuesday 's oil spill hearing on Capitol Hill .
Protesters disrupt oil hearing
Capitol Police physically escorted two protestors from a hearing room after they appeared to be approaching a group oil executives who had just finished testifying .
It was unclear whether the protesters belonged to a particular organization , but one woman was wielding a bottle with dark liquid as she approached the oil executives who had spent the morning testifying about offshore drilling .
Advertisement
It was the only protest incident during an otherwise calm , 5 - hour hearing .
There was a heavy presence of police officers surrounding the room .
But there are points they can agree on .
Breeders need tighter regulation and kill rates are too high .
The RSPCA has taken the first step , releasing a discussion paper on puppy farming and inviting interested parties to make submissions .
'' One of the reasons that we introduced the discussion paper was to get the debate happening , '' RSPCA NSW chief inspector David O'Shannessy said .
He agrees that puppy and kitten farmers - who range from large - scale commercial breeders to smaller backyard breeders - are contributing to the problem of oversupply but says many of them are operating within the law .
'' There is a variation between properties you might describe as puppy farms .
Some of them are absolutely deplorable .
But others are meeting the minimum requirements of care and are therefore legal . ''
The RSPCA has conducted high - profile raids on puppy farms in the past three years , including on one facility in NSW where 190 dogs were being kept in filthy conditions , surrounded by faeces and dead puppies .
The RSPCA find it a difficult area to police and enforce .
'' It 's hard to actually track these people down , '' Mr O'Shannessy said .
'' Often they will advertise dogs on the internet and only give a mobile number as a contact .
They wo n't sell to people on the premises .
They 'll arrange to meet you in a car park or another public place so you do n't get to see the conditions that the animals are living in . ''
Australian Veterinary Association president Mark Lawrie agrees the lack of regulation on breeding makes it problematic to enforce legislation .
'' It 's hard to know the extent of the problem of indiscriminate breeding .
It 's hard to get any reliable statistics . ''
Dr Lawrie claims that animal lovers who accumulate large numbers of pets contribute more to over - population than farmers .
'' I actually think animal hoarding is a bigger problem in terms of indiscriminate breeding .
That 's a complex issue because it involves mental health . ''
But welfare groups maintain there are hundreds of puppy and kitten farms in Australia , and groups such as the RSPCA and local councils are not doing enough to stamp it out .
'' At the moment it is completely unregulated , '' said Animal Liberation NSW project officer Jacqueline , who prefers her surname not to be used due to her undercover field work .
'' Anyone with two animals can call themselves a breeder .
They do so with the complicity of local councils who are supposed to inspect the premises and with the complicity of the RSPCA , which is reluctant to investigate .
'' They have the complicity of the pet shops , which then sell the animals , and the complicity of vets who tend to the animals .
Many of these animals are sold sick or with inherited problems due to inbreeding or with behavioural problems . ''
Paul Archer , of welfare group Death Row Pets , said farmers specifically targeted pet shop chains and websites to offload their animals .
'' The bad breeders will sell to anyone .
They do n't care - they 're in it for profit , not the welfare of the animal .
We need the public to stop and think about what they 're doing before they buy an animal from a pet shop or a website . ''
But the Pet Industry Association of Australia 's chief executive Roger Perkins denies pet shops are selling animals farmed cruelly .
'' Retailers buy their animals from reputable sources .
They offer vet services post - sale , vaccination , microchipping and desexing .
In terms of controlling over population , retailers are doing the responsible thing . ''
Jacqueline disagrees , based on her first - hand knowledge of pet shop practices : '' Apparently the pet industry believes it 's OK to breed animals , export them all over the country , fly them around in small crates when they 're only seven weeks old and put them in the window of a shop .
Apparently that 's not cruelty . ''
Clover Moore plans to re-introduce a bill that would ban the sale of non-rescue animals in pet shops next year .
The bill has won the support of welfare groups .
Lisa Wolfenden , owner of Double Bay shop Dogs in the City , whose brother William made a documentary about puppy farming , refuses to stock animals at her business .
'' I am an animal lover .
I think it would be totally hypocritical of me to sell animals which have been bred in a cruel way , '' she said .
Loading
Both the RSPCA and Australian Veterinary Association , while not supporting the ban on animals in shops , are calling for greater regulation .
As Dr Lawrie points out , vets ultimately bear the burden of unwanted animals .
'' They are doing the euthanasing .
That is traumatic - no one wants to kill animals . ''

Harry Redknapp believes
Spurs need to bring in two or three ' real quality players ' if they are to push on .
Spurs boss looking for ' real quality '
Not standing still
Harry Redknapp believes Tottenham need to bring in two or three ' real quality players ' if they are to build on last season 's achievements .
Spurs exceeded expectations to break into the Premier League 's top four last term and qualify for the UEFA Champions League .
Redknapp is now targeting further success and recently stated that Tottenham should be aiming to challenge for the title .
However , he accepts that to realise such an ambition will be extremely difficult , with Manchester United , Chelsea , Arsenal , Liverpool and big- spending Manchester City also in the hunt for top spot .
Redknapp has been quiet in the transfer market so far this summer as he is happy with the squad currently at his disposal , but he concedes that more new recruits are required .
" People now expect us to do the same again next season and , although we 've got plenty of bodies , we need to bring in maybe two or three real quality players who can push us on , " he said .
" This is a chance Tottenham really should n't waste because we have got ourselves in a position , the best position since the Premier League started , and we have to build on that .
" We 've got to look to compete with the Arsenals and clubs like that every year and it's very important we do n't stand still .
We have got to keep improving if we are going to stay there . "
Tottenham have been linked with moves for the likes of Luis Fabiano and goalkeeper Stipe Pletikosa , with Redknapp acknowledging that quality is more important than quantity .
" I 'm not saying that we necessarily need to spend fortunes but we have to go and get a couple of players in that will make the difference to us , " he added .
" As for our ambitions , it all depends on what I get in .
" If I sign a few players then anything can happen , but if I do n't it is going to be hard to maintain just what we did last season . "
Wrapping this up and another very important point I want to make before going for a walk with the family : A small town that depends on agriculture alone wont cut it if there ’s a serious crisis .
I know this is what Mel Tappan said and to some point I agree with his logic , but not when it comes to depending on agriculture alone to keep a town alinve .
I do n’t agree because I ’ve seen it fail miserably , that ’s why .
You need a small town that also has other industries .
Preferably medium size machinery production , which will do relatively well after the country can no longer afford to import since , which the collapsed currency , its cheaper in some cases to produced locally .
Of course we ’re no longer talking about a small town , are we .
Medium size town ?
So be it .
At least you know it wont die , if something affects the local agriculture .
This town will preferably be at a healthy distance from the mayor metropolis like NY and LA .

Recently I ’ve had several people ask me whether they should buy an iPad now or wait for the second generation that is sure to come next year .
That is certainly a question that anyone that is considering buying electronic devices faces and there are already some consistent indications of areas in which the next generation of the iPad should improve on the current one .
The current generation of the iPad is a great device for doing many things .
In fact , I ’ve noticed that it made me a lot more productive at several tasks I do regularly and after a couple of weeks using it I discovered that going back to the way I did them before was quite a bit of a pain .
I use the iPad for going through emails and tweets much faster than what I was able to do on a notebook or desktop computer .
The interface is just a lot more productive and the low cost of the of the applications have let me experiment and find the ones that are better suited to my own way of working .
I certainly like to read on the iPad .
In fact , the iPad is a great solution for reading all those PDFs you want to read , but do n’t feel like sitting in front of a computer to read .
Through the months I have been following the iPad and how people use it , I came to the conclusion that the iPad is a personal device .
It is not something you would want to share with other people .
That being the case , once you have one in your household , it will be just a matter of time before you start thinking about getting another , for someone else in the family .
With this in mind I feel comfortable in saying that if you see the possibility of using an iPad to become more productive now , to reduce the weight you carry around daily , you should definitely get one now .
If you can find a store that has the model you want , as supply is still having trouble with keeping up with the demand .
The second generation of the iPad , or iPad 2.0 as I have began calling it will most probably have a lot more memory and at least a front facing camera for FaceTime calls .
It will probably have one or two features you and I can’t even begin to think about , as Apple is always looking for new ways to cause an impact .
Just think that when it comes out , if you feel the irresistible urge to get a new model there will always be someone that will be happy to get your iPad 1.0 .

OLIVER , British Columbia , July 6 ( UPI ) --
Volunteer firefighters in a Canadian town found themselves in hot water for quenching their thirst with beer they rescued from a fire they extinguished .
The Canadian Broadcasting Corp. reported Tuesday the entire fire department in Oliver , British Columbia -- more than 30 members -- were suspended for two weeks after it was determined they drank at least one of the six beer kegs they removed from a burning hotel in May .

Initially , just two volunteer firefighters were suspended and the chief took a leave of absence .
But Mayor Pat Hampson said a closer look revealed a wider problem .
" The fire department approached us and said , ' Look , we 've made a stupid mistake here , and we feel we should all take responsibility for it , even the members who are n't at the incident , ' just to show solidarity amongst themselves , " he said .
The suspensions will be staggered , so to speak , so the town is n't left without fire protection .
Another blockade - busting ship with activists and aid on board could be bound for Gaza within a few days after Lebanese authorities granted permission Monday for it to sail first to Cyprus .
" We have been granted permission to go to Cyprus and we are now in the process of making final preparations , " said Yasser Kashlak , a Syrian of Palestinian origin who heads the group organizing the trip — the Free Palestine Movement .
Organizers said the ship plans to sail in the next few days , but did not give an exact date for departure because of security concerns .

Lebanon has given permission for another flotilla to leave Tripoli for Gaza , according to a Beirut minister quoted byMonday morning .
Lebanese Transport Minister Ghazi Aridi said the ship named Julia is now docked at the northern Lebanese port of Tripoli and can set sail once it is cleared by port authorities there .
He said the ship would be allowed to sail to Cyprus and not directly to Gaza
in order to abide by UN Security Council Resolution 1701 , which calls for a full cessation of hostilities by both Lebanon and Israel and forbids any paramilitary activity south of the Litani River .
Aridi said the voyage of the ship , the French - registered Julia , would not violate the terms of the cease - fire resolution .
To clear the confusion over the latest Gaza flotilla initiative , Aridi added that while the ship was named Julia , the voyage itself was named Mariam .

The other project I ’m working on at MSR this summer is a bit more ambitious : our headline goal is to extend GHC to enable typed , functional , type - level programming .
What ’s that , you ask ?
Well , first , let me tell you a little story …
Once upon a time there was a lazy * , pure , functional programming language called Haskell .
It was very careful to always keep its values and types strictly separated .
So of course “ type- level programming ” was completely out of the question !
… or was it ?
In 1997 , along came multi-parameter type classes , soon followed by functional dependencies .
Suddenly , type - level programming became possible ( and even fun and profitable , depending on your point of view ) .
How did this work ?
Whereas normal type classes represent predicates on types ( each type is either an instance of a type class or it is n’t ) , multi- parameter type classes represent relations on types .
For example , if we create some types to represent natural numbers ,
data Z data S n
we can define a multi- parameter type class Plus which encodes the addition relation on natural numbers :
class Plus m n r instance Plus Z n n instance ( Plus m n r ) => Plus ( S m ) n ( S r )
This says that for any types m , n , and r , ( Z , n , n ) are in the Plus relation , and ( S m , n , S r ) are in the Plus relation whenever ( m , n , r ) are .
We can load this into ghci ( after enabling a few extensions , namely MultiParamTypeClasses , FlexibleInstances , and EmptyDataDecls ) , but unfortunately we ca n’t yet actually use the Plus relation to do any type - level computation :
* Main > :t undefined :: ( Plus ( S Z ) ( S Z ) r ) => r undefined :: ( Plus ( S Z ) ( S Z ) r ) => r :: ( Plus ( S Z ) ( S Z ) r ) => r
We asked for the type of something which has type r , given that the relation Plus ( S Z ) ( S Z ) r holds — but notice that ghci was not willing to simplify that constraint at all .
The reason is that type classes are open — there could be lots of instances of the form Plus ( S Z ) ( S Z ) r for many different types r , and ghci has no idea which one we might want .
To the rescue come functional dependencies , which let us specify that some type class parameters are determined by others — in other words , that the relation determined by a multi- parameter type class is actually a function .
class Plus m n r | m n -> r instance Plus Z n n instance ( Plus m n r ) => Plus ( S m ) n ( S r )
Here we ’ve added the functional dependency m n -> r , which says that knowing m and n also determines r .
In practice , this means that we are only allowed to have a single instance of Plus for any particular combination of m and n , and if ghc can determine m and n and finds an instance matching them , it will assume it is the only one and pick r to match .
Now we can actually do some computation ( after enabling UndecidableInstances ) :
* Main > :t undefined :: ( Plus ( S Z ) ( S Z ) r ) => r undefined :: ( Plus ( S Z ) ( S Z ) r ) => r :: S ( S Z )
Aha !
So 1 + 1 = 2 , at the type level !
Type - level programming with multi-parameter type classes and functional dependencies has a strong resemblance to logic programming in languages like Prolog .
We declare rules defining a number of relations , and then “ running ” a program consists of searching through the rules to find solutions for unconstrained variables in a given relation .
( The one major difference is that GHC ’s type class instance search does n’t ( yet ? ) do any backtracking . )
This is getting a bit long so I ’ll break it up into a few posts .
In the next installment , I ’ll explain type families , which are a newer , alternative mechanism for type - level programming in Haskell .
* OK , OK , non -strict .

The leader of the Republican party has spoken .
The round of apologies ca n’t be far behind .
From CNN :
Conservative talk - radio host Rush Limbaugh is taking aim at Republican leaders for rushing to demand Texas Rep .
Joe Barton retract his controversial apology to BP CEO Tony Hayward during last week ’s congressional hearing .
On his radio show Monday , Limbaugh suggested the GOP leadership likely agrees with Barton ’s sentiments , but are driven by recent national polls which suggest the majority of Americans support President Barack Obama ’s push for BP to set aside $ 20 billion for future liability claims .
“ It was a shakedown pure and simple , ” said Limbaugh , echoing the words for which Barton later apologized .
“ And somebody had the audacity to call it what it was and now everybody ’s running for the hills . ”
I thought this was pretty big when I read it this morning , when Michael Steele said the war in Afghanistan was " a war of Obama 's choosing " to a Republican group in Connecticut .
The Republican National Committee spokesman stepped in quickly to try to clean this poo off the sidewalk , saying the following ( via Ben Smith , and if you click through , note Smith 's droll headline ) :
The Chairman clearly supports our troops but believes that success of the war effort in Afghanistan requires the ongoing support of the American people .
The responsibility for building and maintaining that strategy falls squarely on the shoulders of the President .
Like so many Americans , Chairman Steele wants to hear an explanation from President Obama on what his strategy is for winning the war in Afghanistan .
The Petraeus hearings were an opportunity - a missed opportunity - to do that .
Instead , all we hear from the President is criticism of his predecessor for doing exactly the same thing .
But now , TPM is reporting that Bill Kristol is calling on Steele to step down , and other conservatives and Republicans are on the way :
Republicans are furious with RNC Chairman Michael Steele , who was caught on camera saying that the war in Afghanistan is a doomed effort launched by President Obama .
Steele has no shortage of enemies in the GOP and many of them sense an opportunity here .
In fact , several , both privately and publicly , are saying this is the last straw : Steele should resign ... ... In an interview this afternoon , a livid , top GOP operative put it more bluntly .
" This is the height of stupidity and epitomizes the problem that is Michael Steele . "
A separate GOP operative passed along a comment Steele issued late last year when President Obama agreed -- as Republicans were pressuring -- to send additional troops to Afghanistan .
I 'm told that more high profile Republicans -- operatives and electeds -- will come forward shortly with condemnations , and even demands of resignation , later today .
Stay tuned .
A long time ago , I thought Steele had crossed the line of forgiveness with some ambiguous remarks he made about abortion .
I thought if anything constitutes a bridge too far in the GOP , it 's that .
But now we learn that the real line in the sand is warmaking .
It 's kind of impossible to imagine a party chairman getting fired within four months of an election .
There 's so much machinery built around the person of the chairman that rejiggering all that could produce chaos ( which is why you 're going to see the Democrats , if they 're smart , try to talk about Steele all weekend ) .
In addition to that , we all know that Steele got the job only because he 's black , and the GOP wanted a black chairman to be able to talk smack on the black president .
Obama is still president , and he 's still black , facts that probably give Steele the cushion he needs to survive .
But what a dope .
Nothing to do with ideology .
He 's just a second - rater .
Still , I 'm a little surprised at the degree of anger here .
Is it substantive , that he 's knocking a ( mostly ) GOP - conceived invasion and war ?
Is it that he 's implicitly knocking Bush ?
Is it that it 's an implicit knock on the neocons ?
Is it that he sounds like he 's been reading Chomsky ?
All of the above ?
Speaking of folk music , someone should write The Ballad of Michael Steele .
Not surprisingly , conservatives are unhappy with President Obama .
Somewhat surprisingly , liberals are too -- or , at least , a lot of liberal commentators .
On July 4 , Robert Kuttner spoke for many of them when he wrote , on the Huffington Post , that “ we voted our hopes that events could compel Obama to govern as a progressive .
We are still waiting . ”
Bob was primarily upset about Obama ’s failure to push through a new stimulus package .
But he also criticized Obama over health care ( for not getting passionate about it until the last minute ) and the Gulf oil disaster ( for not taking a harder line on British Petroleum ) .
Bob is my old boss and mentor , not to mention a good friend .
I share his frustrations over the policies that have ( and have n't ) come out of Washington lately .
But to suggest that Obama has n’t governed as a progressive seems pretty wrong to me .
Look at the record : Obama has made a pair of liberal appointments to the Supreme Court , the second of whom appears to be on track to easy confirmation .
He ’s populated the National Labor Relations Board with officials who actually believe in labor law .
He ’s rescued the auto industry , and the region of the country that depends upon it , from economic oblivion .
He ’ll likely get the chance to sign a major Wall Street reform package , just as he did an overhaul of the student lending program .
And , of course , he led and won the fight for comprehensive health care reform .
Bob is n’t that impressed and , I know , neither are many other liberals .
Among other things , they think Obama made too many compromises .
The recovery act was too small .
Financial reform wo n’t break up the big banks .
Health care reform has no public option .
Etc etc .

All the birds try to avoid the Google , because they do n't like him and he frightens them ; but some of them he can never catch , especially those with the red beaks .
You can never see these birds anywhere except in Google land which is far far away , and only children can go there ; and even they must be nearly – but not quite – asleep .
Now in this book you will find pictures of Google birds ; some , though ugly , are very nice ; others , though pretty , are very nasty .
So , perhaps , really the pretty ones are ugly and the ugly ones pretty !
Who can tell ?
The Google 's Garden Now on the facing page you see The Google 's garden ( looking East ) ;
The animal , that sits on guard , Is quite a harmless little beast .
Please note the ' Pleecemen Birds ' as well On either side stand sentinel .
The Lesser Nockit How can one describe this remarkable bird
Which no one has seen and which everyone 's heard ;
It hammers and knocks on the trees and the rocks ,
And batters and raps at the windy , And rattles old bones and shuffles the stones
And kicks up a terribly shindy
And hullaballoo !
It never stops still and it makes people ill With its nerve - racking ear - splitting cry , Which it utters they say both by night and by day , And really I can not think why !
No more can you !
The Tango The Tango trips upon her toes , ( That 's why she 's called the Tango ) And if you tease her , off she goes As quickly as she can go !
The Brown Willy Just look at Brown Willy Now is n't he silly ?
He 's just caught an eel in the water !
He 'll throw it up high Right into the sky
To be caught in the air by his daughter !
( Those two little things are flies , not aeroplanes )
The Sun Bird
That great head , at any rate for me , has Positively no attraction , And its general appearance gives one Very little satisfaction .
Yet what perspicacity we find there Hidden in his ugly brain - pan .
Keen wits a lunatic may have too , Just the same as any sane man .
( I ca n't understand a word of this , can you Mother ? )
The Lemonsqueezer Have you seen the Lemonsqueezer Feeding Herbert and Louisa ?
The Blue - Billed Ork
This excessively conceited bird spends all his time looking for starfish , jellyfish , and crabs , and when he sees one near him he just loosens his neck and lets his beak drop .
You can't see any starfish or crabs in the picture because he is n't hungry just now .
O! little crab , O ! little crab ,
Be careful where you walk , Or you may find yourself inside The Tummy of the Ork !
The Flabbytoes But mark !!
What is that sound I hear ?
Someone in agony I fear ! –
Oh no !!
It is old Flabbytoes , You can't mistake his funny nose .
The Shivver - Doodle
To break the ice in wintry climes and dive into the Sea To get one 's food at feeding times , does not appeal to me .
If I liked fish , I would not wish to eat it raw and chew it , But then you see I am not he , cos ' he has got to do it .
Great Skull - Headed Stone Trot With ponderous tread he walks for miles
And miles amongst the stones , Searching along the sandy shore For fossils shells and bones .
And when the wind is moaning
And the night is very dark , If you listen at the window You can sometimes hear him , – Hark !
The Poggle The Poggle , as you have probably heard , Is also known as the Pineapple Bird .
By nature he is soft and gently kind
To smaller birds who love his fruity mind .
So tame that he will feed out of your hands .
( He lives exclusively on wasps with yellow bands . )
The Great McDoo or Dewar Bird The Great McDoo , aged ninety - nine , Is rare but very cold , And even in the winter time Is thirsty so I 'm told .
The Junket The little Junket spots his food From almost any altitude , Volplanés from an awful height And plunges almost out of sight !
The Little Horn Back
This funny thing lives in a part of Google Land where there are dreadful Landslips and Avalanches .
When he hears the roar of an approaching Avalanche , he snuggles in under his hard horny back and just waits for trouble .
But the falling rocks and stones slide over his back and only made him tickle .
Sometimes he gets completely covered up and remains buried for several weeks , but he always crawls out all right , for no Little Horn Back has ever been hurt by a mere Avalanche .
The Swank The Swank is quick and full of vice , He tortures beetles also mice .
He bites their legs off and he beats them Into a pulp , and then he eats them .
The Wilyou or Pagoda Bird Now if you said
When you 're in bed , ' Ah Wilyou , ' Will you sing ? '
He would reply ' Ononoti , ' And quickly take to wing .
The Soft - Nosed Wollop The Soft - nosed Wollop lives on ice , ( In summer , Halibuts and Soles )
And when it 's slippery he turns Upon his back and rolls .
The Mirabelle Old sailors have a tale they tell , How once the song of a Mirabelle Enticed a ship upon the rocks
Where perished all the crew .
I think it most improbable
That such a bird would cast a spell Upon a ship , do n't you ?
The Gogo or Camel Bird
Now this is one of the largest birds to be found in all Google Land , and there really is not room enough for his body in the picture .
He eats most every living thing , and especially little young birds that can hardly fly .
He is horribly cruel , and no one ( not even the Google itself ) wants him to remain in Google Land .
That 's why they call him Gogo .
The Google 's Garden ( Looking West )

A secret “ white paper ” that recommends selling chunks of Ontario ’s liquor , lottery and electricity corporations — raising up to $ 12 billion — will be debated by Premier Dalton McGuinty ’s cabinet as early as next week , the Star has learned .
Liberal insiders say the study urges the government to meld the Liquor Control Board of Ontario , Ontario Power Generation , Hydro One , and the Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corp. into one “ super corporation . ”
It proposes 20 per cent of “ SuperCorp ” would then be sold – at least half to favoured institutional investors , such as the Ontario Teachers ’ Pension Plan and Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System , with the remainder available to individuals in an initial public offering .
“ If cabinet does n’t make a decision soon there is not time to do this ; if they do make a decision quickly , there is , ” a senior Liberal said Friday .
Behind the scenes , McGuinty is pushing for the bold initiative to help bankroll Liberal promises in the 2011 election — including an expensive , but politically helpful plan to reduce university and college tuition fees .
“ We want to the take the proceeds out of assets we already own and invest them in other assets to make some legacy investments , ” said the Liberal .
The white paper , prepared after the province paid $ 200,000 to CIBC World Markets and Goldman Sachs to study the value of Crown assets , acknowledges the complex structure of a new company , encompassing three nuclear power plants , 29,000 km of transmission lines , 610 liquor stores , as well as casinos , slot machines , and lotteries .
“ It ’ll be a challenge to get a shareholders ’ agreement that meets the needs of the investor , ” admitted one proponent , noting Queen ’s Park would maintain regulatory oversight over the super corporation while ceding “ fiduciary control ” to the minority shareholder .
“ SuperCorp has to be run as a business , otherwise investors wo n’t want anything to do with it .
But we are the regulator for ( electricity ) generation and transmission , booze sales , and gaming so we would keep our authority for the ( public ) safety and social responsibility aspects of it , ” the source said .
The government is seeking a tax ruling from Ottawa to confirm the wisdom of creating a conglomerate instead of selling off parts of the Crown corporations individually .
“ There ’s tax and accounting reasons — if you do them separately there ’s tax leakage to the feds , ” said someone familiar with the proposal .
Selling 20 per cent of the business , which the Liberals hope is a small enough amount to be palatable to public - sector unions and others opposed to privatization , could just be the first step .
“ You could well sell another 20 per cent in three years ’ time and get even more for it , ” said the person familiar with the scheme .
Sources say David Livingston , the influential president and chief executive officer of Infrastructure Ontario , the provincial agency that oversees the building of roads , hospitals , bridges , courthouses , and water systems , is being touted to head the new $ 60 - billion mega-corporation .
On March 6 , the Star revealed the privatization effort was afoot as part of the Liberals ’ Open Ontario plan for governing through to the October 2011 vote .
The proposal is expected to be discussed as soon as next Wednesday when the cabinet convenes in a summer retreat at York University ’s Glendon College .
But there is resistance among some ministers who fear the government has already bitten off more than it can chew with the July 1 implementation of the 13 per cent harmonized sales tax , which will raise levies on one in six goods and services , including gasoline .
“ It ’s a risky thing to do going into an election cycle , ” said one high - ranking Liberal .
“ I have a lot of confidence in Livingston , but that does n’t mean this cake is baked , ” said the Liberal .
“ And once you open the door to this , how soon is it before future governments are selling off the remainder ? ”
Another skeptical official warned of numerous hurdles to overcome before any sale could proceed — including the fact some institutional investors are prohibited from putting money into gambling businesses .
“ Unions are already telling government they will do everything to fight it , ” said the Liberal , predicting major headaches for McGuinty .
“ ( Would ) SuperCorp have the right to fire 30 per cent of LCBO staff ?
How about outsourcing or breaking a union in the next contract negotiations ?
Can they open a new casino in Toronto ? ” said the skeptic .

“ Oh , and what happens when one of a million companies who have n’t been selected as a lucky … pension fund , but are interested in buying one of the four ( Crown corporations ) , comes out and says ‘ We would have paid more ? ’ ”
Mindful of such criticism , McGuinty is privately assuring doubters that , unlike the failed scheme by the previous Progressive Conservative government to sell Hydro One in 2002 , there would be no outright sale of Crown holdings .
That would make it different from the Tories ’ controversial 1999 liquidation of Highway 407 for $ 3.1 billion , which led to soaring tolls for drivers and a lack of government control .

Hei , denne artikkelen er over ett år gammel og kan inneholde utdatert informasjon
| || ( Dagbladet ) : Reaksjonene fra det politiske miljøet har ikke latt vente på seg etter at alvorlig syke Kenneth Lunde ( 48 ) sto fram i avisa i dag .
48 - åringen fra Lyngdal , som sliter med alvorlig søvnapné i tillegg til en rekke andre lidelser , har fått tildelt 24 måneders ventetid i helsekøen før han kommer inn til en enkel , men potensielt livreddende undersøkelse hos Helse Sør - Øst .
Overlege Carsten
Tjell sier til Dagbladet at han helst ville hatt Kenneth inne til undersøkelse innen én måned - til nød tre .
- Med alle tilleggsproblemene er det opplagt at han kan få varig men eller dø mens han venter i køen , sier øre-nese - hals - spesialisten .
- Helt uakseptabelt
Det er ikke bare folk fra opposisjonen som er opprørt .
Også Ap - stortingsvara og lege Are Helseth føler han må snakke ut etter at Kenneth sto fram .
- To år i kø er helt uakseptabelt , jeg blir veldig bekymret .
Denne pasienten er blant de sykeste i sin gruppe , det er feil at han skal vente så lenge .
Her må rutinene skjerpes , sier Helseth til Dagbladet .
- Hva er roten til problemet ?
- Dette er et systemproblem , som vi må ta tak i - det dreier seg om at ventetida fastsettes ut fra sykehusets kapasitet og ikke den individuelle pasients behov .
Og med så lange ventetider som her minner det om skandalen med Sykehuset Asker og Bærum , der de trikset med datoene , sier han .
Brev til Strøm - Erichsen Jon Jæger Gåsvatn , Frp 's helsepolitiske talsmann , har skrevet brev til helseminister Anne - Grete Strøm - Erichsen ( Ap ) der han ber om at hun snarest sørger for at Kenneth får behandling - ved et offentlig eller privat helseforetak i Norge eller utlandet .
- Dette går bokstavelig talt på helsa løs for pasienten , og det er åpenbart at han burde fått hjelp før , sier Gåsvatn til Dagbladet .
- Jeg reagerer på at han ser seg nødt til å gå til Dagbladet med saken .
Dessverre er det eneste mulighet for mange til å nå fram , sier stortingsrepresentanten .
Som resten av høyresida i opposisjonen ivrer Frp for å inkludere private helseaktører i fritt - sykehusvalg - ordningen .

- Det ville fått ned køen .
Istedenfor opplever vi at den rødgrønne regjeringen bygger ned allerede godt fungerende private tilbud og skaper monopolliknende tilstander som ikke er et demokrati verdig , sier Gåsvatn .
- Overrasket - Jeg må innrømme jeg er overrasket over denne saken , to års ventetid er veldig spesielt .
Jeg mistenker at ventetida er satt ut fra kapasitet istedenfor en helsemessig vurdering - at tida er blitt lang fordi køen er lang , sier Høyres helsepolitiske talsmann Bent Høie til Dagbladet .
- Det er også et politisk spørsmål - i dag får man ikke dekket behandling ved private sykehus med mindre ventetida overskrides .
Det mener vi er for dårlig , de private aktørene må komme inn under fritt sykehusvalg , det ville hjulpet dramatisk på køen .
Også Høie trekker paralleller til skandalen ved Sykehuset Asker og Bærum .
- Her har sykehuset sikret seg ved å sette en veldig laNg frist - det minner om Asker og Bærum , der de endret fristene , sier han .
- Altfor lang tid Ragnhild Mathisen ( Ap ) , statssekretær i Helse - og omsorgsdepartementet , understreker at hun ikke kan kommentere Kenneths sak spesifikt .
- Men 24 måneder høres ut som altfor lang ventetid .
Våre retningslinjer til helseforetakene sier at ved mistanke om alvorlig apné skal ventetida for behandling være maks 13 uker , sier hun til Dagbladet .
- Hva bør pasienten gjøre ?
- Jeg sitter ikke med detaljene i saken og kan ikke kommentere det .
Men han burde klage til sitt lokale Helsetilsyn , svarer Mathisen .
Hun fortsetter :
- Ventetida skal fastsettes ut fra en medisinskfaglig vurdering - og hvis vurderingen tilsier rask behandling , skal pasienten inn raskt .
Det skal ikke bero på kapasitetsmessige hensyn .
Helsekø i Norge •
Det var pr. februar i år 262 671 pasienter som ventet i helsekø .
Av disse hadde 138 874 rett på nødvendig hjelp .
• Gjennomsnittlig ventetid for pasienter i køen er 69 dager ( 2009 ) .
I 2008 var ventetida 67 dager .

- Men her ser det jo ut som det har gjort nettopp det .
Hva akter regjeringen å gjøre for å bedre tilstandene ?
- Vi har gitt foretakene klar beskjed om å få ned ventetida .
Det må gjøres gjennom bl .a. å styrke beredskapen .
- Opposisjonen mener private foretak må inkluderes mer i ordningene .
- Men vi bruker jo allerede private foretak .
Hvis et offentlig foretak finner at de ikke kan gi tilstrekkelig eller rask nok behandling , står de fritt til å henvise til andre foretak - f.eks .
et privat et .
Det samme gjelder ved fristbrudd .
At vi ikke benytter oss private i dag , stemmer rett og slett ikke .
Counterfeit currency is now so widespread in England that the government could soon be forced to reissue the one - pound coin , according to the Telegraph .
While in 2002 1 % of one - pound coins were fake , the figure is now 5 % , or 1 in 20 , and the quality of counterfeits is so high that most people can't tell the difference .
Metal Miner challenges readers --
Can you spot the fake below ?
It 's not crazy to think that citizens could lose faith in the coin already , given that other countries have run into currency confidence crises at far lower counterfeit rates .
At this level of counterfeit though it may become a necessity .
[ For the government to reissue everything . ]
Other countries have been forced down that route .
The 5 Rand coin in 2004 was re-issued when taxi drivers and shopkeepers in South Africa refused to accept them – in South Africa the number of fakes was just 2 % of those in circulation .
Again , note that the fake rate is 5 % for one - pound coins .
In the meantime , there could be a ' nice ' black market arbitrage :
Anyone wanting to cheat the parking machines meter only has to lay their hands on a few Swazi lilangeni , minted from the same planchets as the British pound coin , and hence the Swaziland coin has the same chemical constitution , diameter , and mass .
The lilangeni is only worth 11 to the pound at current exchange rates giving the user a handsome ( if illegal ) profit .
There has to be sufficient margin here to cover the cost of a plane ticket .
Oh , and here 's the answer to the coin question :
The first is the fake and the second is a real Royal Mint coin .
The edge detail on the first is not as clean and distinct as the real coin , and some fakes have the queens head on one side orientated out of alignment from the image on the reverse .
Health plans that say mental illnesses can't be treated like physical ailments are relying on an " outdated argument " without merit that does not reflect " three decades of scientific research , " 52 House members wrote in a recent letter to regulators .
The comments come as a landmark law requiring parity in how health plans cover physical and mental illness went into effect Thursday .
" We encourage agencies involved with the implementation of [ the parity and healthcare reform ] laws to fully evaluate and reject clams by insurance companies seeking to weaken the consumer protections intended by Congress , " the letter says .
The letter was spearheaded by Rep. Paul Tonko ( D - N.Y. ) and co-signed by 49 House Democrats and Rep. Vernon Ehlers ( R - Mich . ) ; it 's addressed to Kathleen Sebelius , Hilda Solis and Timothy Geithner — the secretaries of Health and Human Services , Labor and Treasury , respectively .
The Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act , named after former Sens. Paul Wellstone ( D - Minn. ) and Pete Domenici ( R - N.M. ) , was signed into law in 2008 .
It requires that large - group health plans that offer mental health and substance use disorder coverage do so on parity with their medical and surgical coverage .
The parity requirements apply to six categories : inpatient in - network , inpatient out - of - network , outpatient in - network , outpatient out - of - network , emergency care and prescription drugs ; for example , a plan can no longer offer different deductibles or out - of - network benefits for medical and mental health coverage .
The law applies to plan years starting Thursday , but some actuaries say most health plans are n't ready .

Linus took that electric organ and reverse - engineered it , transforming it into the Chipophone , the ultimate instrument for a live - action chiptune performance .
Just watch Linus performing the theme from 1985 's ZX Spectrum game Spellbound .
You can check out Linus ' page for a full rundown of what he did to turn a run-down electric organ into the ultimate chiptune performance instrument .

It really is a gorgeous piece of machinery .
My only suggestion , borrowed from one of the commenters on Linus ' web page ?
It needs a NES paint job .

The famous soundtrack composers
( CNN ) -- Voters in Fremont , Nebraska passed a much - debated immigration measure Monday that would prohibit businesses and landlords from hiring or renting to illegal immigrants .
The ordinance had divided the community and put the eastern Nebraskan city into national headlines .
A local organization decried the new ordinance on its website .
" It is with great disappointment and sadness that tonight we acknowledge a majority of Fremont voters approving this misguided ordinance , " the group called One Fremont - One Future said .
" In reality , the passage of this ordinance shows that we have much work to do in our community to educate , break down barriers , and build relationships . "
The American Civil Liberties Union has indicated it will file a lawsuit .
Similar measures were passed in Hazelton , Pennsylvania , and Farmers Branch , Texas , but they were later struck down by the courts .
In Hazelton , voters in 2006 approved a measure to enact practically the same law that Fremont has voted to adopt .
But in July 2007 , a federal judge found that immigration laws should be left solely to the federal government .
In May of 2008 , a federal judge ruled the Farmers Branch law , which would bar landlords from renting to illegal immigrants , was unconstitutional .
" Those ordinances did not withstand legal scrutiny .
They both failed in the courts when they were challenged , " said Laurel Marsh , executive director of Nebraska 's ACLU .
The reason according to Marsh : Both laws violated the U.S. Constitution 's Supremacy clause and the 14th Amendment .
In addition , she said it 's the federal government 's responsibility to set immigration policy and " we are not well - served when communities or states try to set policy on their own . "
Gregory Minchak of the National League of Cities said that it's the lack of federal immigration policy that is causing these cities to take matters into their own hands .
" Because of the absence of the feds doing anything , there 's a lot of financial , cultural , political strains that are occurring [ in cities and states ] , " he said .
" They are just starting to act on their own . "
BOSTON – The fighting mood at the 39th Convention of America ’s 1.2 million - member public workers union here was tempered with some sadness this week because of the retirement of AFSCME Secretary - Treasurer William Lucy after a 57 year stint with the union .
Lucy worked with the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. during the 1968 strike by sanitation workers in Memphis .
He continued his collaboration with King until the civil right leader ’s assassination .
He is a founder and president of the Coalition of Black Trade Unionists , an organization that includes both union leaders and rank - and - file trade unionists who fight for what they see as the special needs of African - American and other minority workers .
When the AFL - CIO took a position of neutrality in the Nixon vs. McGovern contest for the presidency of the United States in 1972 , the CBTU , under Lucy ’s leadership , came out boldly for McGovern .
He said at the time that the labor movement could not remain neutral when the choice for the nation was between someone who wanted to roll back labor and civil rights and someone who stood for those rights .
In the mid-1980 ’s Lucy helped found the Free South Africa movement .
Out of that organization there developed a nationwide and international struggle against apartheid that eventually resulted in freedom for Nelson Mandela and collapse of the hated apartheid system in South Africa .
A video presentation at the convention portrayed Lucy ’s history as a fighter for civil rights and economic justice .
“ We ’ve always known that there ’s a crisis , ” Lucy said during his farewell speech .
“ It might be more intense now , but there ’s always been a crisis for millions of people not as lucky as we are in this room , ” he said .
“ There ’s a daily crisis in their lives , as they struggle to put bread on their tables , to put clothes on their backs , and have a roof over their heads .
We have a responsibility to help them out . ”
Lucy said he hoped that , “ when the final history of this union is written people will say of me simply that I did my best . ”
Thousands began chanting , “ Thank you Bill ! ” as they waved placards that said the same thing .
They kept it up for more than five minutes .

Autism and autism spectrum disorders ( ASDs ) actually represent a rather large continuum of conditions that range from very severe neurodevelopmental delay and abnormalities to the relatively mild .
In severe cases , the child is nonverbal and displays a fairly well - characterized set of behaviors , including repetitive behaviors such as “ stimming ” ( for example , hand flapping , making sounds , head rolling , and body rocking . ) , restricted behavior and focus , ritualistic behavior , and compulsive behaviors .
In more mild cases , less severe compulsion , restriction of behavior and focus , and ritualistic behaviors do not necessarily preclude functioning independently in society , but such children and adults may have significant difficulties with social interactions and communication .
Because ASDs represent a wide spectrum of neurodevelopmental disorders whose symptoms typically first manifest themselves to parents between the ages of two and three , the idea that vaccines cause autism and ASDs has been startlingly difficult to dislodge and has fueled an anti-vaccine movement , both here in the U.S. and in other developed nations , particularly the U.K. and Australia .
This movement has been stubbornly resistant to multiple scientific studies that have failed to find any link between vaccines in autism or the other favorite bogeyman of the anti-vaccine movement , the mercury - containing thimerosal preservative that used to be in many childhood vaccines in the U.S. until the end of 2001 .
Add to that the rising apparent prevalence of ASDs , and , confusing correlation with causation , the anti-vaccine movement concludes that vaccines must be the reason for the “ autism epidemic . ”
In reality , autism and ASDs appear to be increasing in prevalence due to diagnostic substition , better screening , and the broadening of the diagnostic criteria that occurred in 1994 .
Autism prevalence does not appear to be rising , at least not dramatically , at all , as the prevalence of ASDs , when assessed carefully , appears to be similar in adults as it is in children .
If the true prevalence rate of autism and ASDs has increased , it has not increased by very much .
In reality autism appears to have a major and probably predominant genetic component , and several scientific studies over the last few years have linked autism with various genetic abnormalities .
Not surprisingly , given the varied presentation and severity of ASDs , these studies have not managed to identify single genes that produce autism or ASDs with a high degree of penetrance ( probability of causing the phenotype if the gene is present ) .
Indeed , one can argue that the state of current evidence is that ASDs are due to multiple genes , perhaps dozens or hundreds .
Again , this is not surprising given the heterogeneity of ASD severity , presentation , and symptoms .
One of the more surprising studies supporting a genetic basis for autism appeared to much fanfare in Nature last week .
The study by Pinto et al , looks at the functional impact of global rare copy number variation in autism spectrum disorders .
Its results are rather surprising in that the large team of investigators ( studies of this type take a lot of people to carry out ) found that it may be relatively uncommon copy number variations in various genes that lead to the phenotype of autism or ASDs .
Before you can understand what this paper found , you need to know what copy number variation is .
In basic genetics and biology classes , many of you probably learned , depending on how long ago you took the courses , that we have two copies of each gene , one on each chromosome , one inherited from the father and one inherited from the mother .
The exception is that men have a Y - chromosome instead of a second X chromosome and therefore have only one copy of genes on the X and Y chromosome , the X - linked genes inherited from the mother , the Y - linked genes inherited from the father .
Of course , nature is seldom quite so neat , and now that we have powerful tools for sequencing the entire genome and probing its entire DNA to seek out anomalies , we ’re finding that things are n’t quite so simple .
( Sometimes I marvel that we ever did think things to be that simple . )
It turns out that there is considerable variation in the copy numbers of some genes in normal people .
This is due to the rare duplication or deletion of a stretch of chromosome during replication .
Such errors can leave a person with , for example , one copy on one chromosome and two on another .
Although these events are rare for individual stretches of chromosomal DNA , over time and over many generations they can lead to some genes having several .
Moreover , there appear to be “ hot spots ” in various chromosomes that are more prone to duplications or deletions than other regions of DNA .
Because I ’m a cancer surgeon and biologist , I ’m mostly familiar with variations in gene copy number associated with cancer , and there are many of these .
Duplications and amplifications of stretches of DNA are practically the sine qua non of cancer .
Often in cancer the amount of gene product in the form of protein that a given gene makes is proportional to the copy number .
For instance , in breast cancer , there is a stretch of DNA known as the 8p11 - 12 amplicon .
Basically , it ’s a stretch of DNA on the p arm of chromosome 8 that is commonly amplified in breast cancer .
This region of chromosome 8 is under active study , and there appear to be a number of candidate oncogenes there .
One consequence of our learning about such amplified regions is that a formerly popular ( about 30 years ago ) and somewhat simplistic idea that single oncogenes would explain carcinogenesis , an idea that was later supplanted by a less simplistic but still too simple idea of multistage carcinogenesis in which a series of mutations in key oncogenes led to cancer .
Now we understand that it is many genes that cause cancer .
Whole networks of genes are usually perturbed , and , although there are commonalities in many of the networks purturbed among different cancers , the specifics can vary widely from cancer to cancer .
Cancer is one extreme , though , and obviously ASDs are not cancer ( or , more appropriately , cancers , given that cancer is not just one disease ) .
ASDs do , however , appear to require multiple genetic changes in order to manifest themselves .
Although CNVs are associated with many diseases and conditions , the abnormalities in are not as dramatic or numerous as they are in cancer .
In the study under discussion , Pinto et al undertook an a survey of as many CNVs as they could identify in autistic children .
Basically , they genotyped 1,275 children with ASD and 1,981 neurotypical controls and compared the frequency of single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) according to the following scheme :
It ’s not necessary for you to understand in detail what SNPs are .
Basically they are variations in single nucleotides within a gene that are useful because by examining them scientists can estimate CNVs and other genetic variants in various genes .
This allows the performance of what is known as a genome wide association study ( GWAS ) , which can look at genetic variation over the entire genome , which is what Pinto et al did using a technique that can look for SNPs in 1.2 million loci per sample .
Genetic variations that are more common in people with a disease are said to be associated with that disease .
GWAS can be very powerful , but , like much of modern genomic medicine , these studies produce incredible amounts of data , with all the attendant difficulties , both computational and scientific , in interpreting what all the associations that are found may or may not mean .
As the authors note in their introduction , previous attempts at GWAS for autism have identified candidate genetic loci at 5p14.1 and 5p15.2 .
However , variations in these loci can only account for a relatively small percentage of the heritibility of ASD , hence the desire to examine the entire genome in a large number of children with ASD .
What Pinto et al found was this :
The autism spectrum disorders ( ASDs ) are a group of conditions characterized by impairments in reciprocal social interaction and communication , and the presence of restricted and repetitive behaviours1 .
Individuals with an ASD vary greatly in cognitive development , which can range from above average to intellectual disability2 .
Although ASDs are known to be highly heritable ( ~90 % ) 3 , the underlying genetic determinants are still largely unknown .
Here we analysed the genome - wide characteristics of rare ( < 1 % frequency ) copy number variation in ASD using dense genotyping arrays .
When comparing 996 ASD individuals of European ancestry to 1,287 matched controls , cases were found to carry a higher global burden of rare , genic copy number variants ( CNVs ) ( 1.19 fold , P = 0.012 ) , especially so for loci previously implicated in either ASD and / or intellectual disability ( 1.69 fold , P = 3.4 × 10 - 4 ) .
Among the CNVs there were numerous de novo and inherited events , sometimes in combination in a given family , implicating many novel ASD genes such as SHANK2 , SYNGAP1 , DLGAP2 and the X - linked DDX53 - PTCHD1 locus .
We also discovered an enrichment of CNVs disrupting functional gene sets involved in cellular proliferation , projection and motility , and GTPase / Ras signalling .
Our results reveal many new genetic and functional targets in ASD that may lead to final connected pathways .
One interesting finding was that 5.7 % of the CNVs discovered appeared not to be inherited ; i.e. , they were de novo , meaning , basically , new CNVs .
More important , though , was the bioinformatic and systems biology analysis of the CNVs .
If there ’s one thing that the Human Genome Project has taught us it ’s that single genes are rarely that important in disease .
Usually , it ’s genes that encode for various proteins in discrete functional classes and intracellular signaling pathways , something that can be analyzed by systems biology and network analysis , something I ’m increasingly having to do for my cancer research .
The result are “ bubble diagrams , ” which map out various networks and network “ hubs ” that are important in differences observed between normal and the condition being studied .
To come up with such maps and pathway identification requires large numbers of specimens , terrabytes of computer storage space , and a lot of processing power , power that did n’t exist until this decade .
In Pinto et al , such an analysis led to the identification of potential new pathways whose function in ASDs may be abnormal compared to the control group .
These pathways are mapped out in the following illustration :
Candidate pathways for ASD identified by this method included genes involved with the cytoskeleton and microtubules , as well as genes involved in cell projection and motility , all of which are involved in cell migration .
Other candidate pathways included genes involved in cell adhesion .
It is not difficult to imagine how defective or altered migration and adhesion of neurons might result in the creation of abnormal neural pathways and thus result in the differences in cognition and behavior observed in ASDs .
Of course , I ’m putting things very simply .
Even if this is true and these pathways are involved in ASDs , we know so little about how neural networks result in cognition and behavior that it will take a very long time and a lot of work to figure out exactly why and how abnormalities in these pathways result in ASDs .
The same is true of other potential pathways implicated by these studies .
These include GTPase and ras signaling pathways , as well as other kinase pathways .
It ’s not necessary for the lay reader to understand the full significance of these pathways .
I do n’t even know the full significance of these pathways in neurons , although I am familiar with them in cancer .
Rather , it ’s necessary only to know that they are involved in the transmission of signals from protein receptors on the cell surface into the cell , with the result being a number of processes , such as proliferation , migration , and the transmission of signals between neurons , among others .
Almost as important as the candidate pathways implicated by this study that clearly need further study to validate whether they are truly involved in the pathogenesis of ASDs or not are the pathways that were not implicated .
One of the major claims of the “ autism biomed ” movement , the group of quacks who claim that they can treat autism with all manner of woo ranging from chelation therapy to various antioxidants and supplements , is that there are significant defects in pathways involved in countering the effects of oxidative stress , particularly pathways that result in glutathione production .
( Glutathione is one of the major scavengers of reactive oxygen species–a .k.a. free radicals–in the cell . )
Such claims were prominently featured by the lawyers for the complainants in the Autism Omnibus .
Treatments allegedly targeting “ detoxification ” pathways involving “ Glutathione , Cystathionine , Homocysteine , Methionine ” figure prominently on the website of many a quack and are a favorite among the “ vaccines cause autism ” crowd .
Do n’t ask me how “ vaccine injury ” somehow causes oxidative stress sufficient to “ cause autism . ”
Anti-vaccine “ scientists ” have long and convoluted pseudoscientific explanations that are implausible and unconvincing .
Guess what ?
Not a single one of the common “ detoxification ” or oxidative stress pathways implicated in ASDs by the “ autism biomed ” movement showed up in the analysis of the SNP data by Pinto et al .
Big surprise , there .
Well , not really .
Of course , the fact that Pinto et al failed to find any of these pathways in ASDs in their analysis will no doubt be seized upon as “ proof ” that their analysis is hopelessly flawed .
Just you wait .
It ’s coming .
Because everything old is new again when it comes to the anti-vaccine movement I predict that Mark Blaxill will resurrect the same sorts of dubious criticisms of autism genetics studies that he made in this post from a year ago about an autism genetics study that predated Pinto et al :
But if the de novo CNV theory was plausible at one level , it was absurd at another .
The genetic mutations the theory proposed ( because this was the best the available evidence could support ) were completely non-specific .
The copy variants were spread widely ( even randomly ) over the genome , the theory went .
No individual mutation was responsible for autism , just the unhappy presence of the wrong one .
And these non-specific mutations were not only widely spread , they were virtually undetectable in the infant : no dysmorphic features ; generally normal birth and ( in many cases development ) ; and the beautiful children we so often see affected by autism .
In other words these CNVs were a case of immaculate mutations .
And it was the perfect new project for the genetics research community .
A wide open field of research opportunities .
Lots of new money .
And a chance to explain past failure away as part of the inexorable march towards genetic understanding .
Ah , yes .
Likening science to religion .
It ’s a favorite canard of cranks of all stripes , be they anti-vaccinationists , creationists , alt - med promoters , 9/11 Truthers , and Holocaust deniers .
I ’ve heard anti-vaccine zealots refer to “ Vaccinianity “ ; creationists refer to the “ Church of Darwin “ ; and Holocaust deniers refer to “ Holocaustianity ” ( warning : source is a French Holocaust denial website ) , among others .
The intent is obvious :
Try to paint the science detested as being faith - based rather than science - based .
The other favored attack , as those of you who read my post earlier today know , is to claim “ conflicts of interest , ” even when there are n’t any by any reasonable definition of the term .
Although Blaxill had n’t tried his hand at a pseudoscientific deconstruction of this study as of Sunday afternoon , John Stone over at the anti-vaccine propaganda blog Age of Autism has already pulled this gambit .
In a post entitled Scherer of Nature Autism Gene Study Fails to Disclose Pharma Funding As Competing Interest , Stone opines :
Prof Stephen Scherer who is the senior author of the autism gene study launched in Nature last week holds the ‘ GlaxoSmithKline - CIHR Pathfinder Chair in Genetics and Genomics at the Hospital for Sick Children and University of Toronto .
The title used to be ‘ GlaxoSmithKline - CIHR Endowed Chair ” , GSK being one of the defendant companies in the UK MMR litigation
Mr. Stone is clearly ignorant of just what an endowed chair is .
Basically , a company or wealthy donor gives a university a lot of money , and the university sets up an endowed chair using that money .
The interest and dividends from the fund used to set up the chair are put at the disposal of the holder of the chair to do research and scholarship as he or she sees fit .
The reason such chairs are desirable is because an endowed chair gives a researcher a reliable supply of funding without the need to write grant proposals or a department chair a source of funds for various projects that does n’t have to come out of the departmental budget .
It often allows a researcher to do more exploratory work or a department chair to engage in various research and educational activities by doling out funds from the chair to his faculty , for example , to support pilot projects by young faculty .
Once an endowed chair is set up , the donor usually has no say over who gets the chair or how the money for the chair is spent .
Claiming that Professor Scherer ’s holding the GSK chair at his institution is an insurmountable COI that needed to be reported is , quite simply , ridiculous to anyone in academia who knows what an endowed chair is .
Clearly , Mr. Stone does not although one commenter going by the ‘nym of Werdna does try to set Mr. Stone straight .
It ’s a rare thing indeed on AoA for a commenter to take a blogger to task like that , something that usually only happens when an AoA blogger makes a mistake so egregious even for some AoA readers .
Equally ridiculous is Mr. Stone ’s lack of understanding of what a corresponding or first author is on a biomedical research paper :
While Prof Scherer ’s departmental colleague Dalila Pinto is listed as lead author of the paper Scherer is listed as ‘ correspondence author ’ and he identifies himself as ‘ senior author ’ in Kevin Leitch ’s LeftBrain / RightBrain blog .
Here ’s a hint for Mr. Stone .
The lead author of the paper is an honor usually reserved for the person who had the most to do with designing and doing the research .
Most of the time the first author is the person who actually wrote the manuscript .
On the other hand , the corresponding author of a scientific paper ( at least a biomedical paper ) is usually the author listed last or near last .
More importantly for Mr. Stone ’s criticism , the corresponding author and the senior author are nearly always one in the same , namely the author in whose laboratory and using whose funding the research described in the paper was performed .
That ’s it .
That ’s all those terms mean .
There ’s no inconsistency there .
The terms are interchangeable .
Mr. Stone would do well to learn a little bit about what he speaks before embarrassing himself so .
I ’d be happy to educate him .
Mr. Stone ’s follies aside , no doubt when Blaxill or whoever at AoA decides to attack Pinto et al shows up to do it , he ’ll repeat the same breathtaking combination of ignorance and binary thinking that he did a year ago .
As a pre-emptive rebuttal , I ’ll cite popular science blogger P.Z. Myers , who put it well when he pointed out that these things are very complicated .
So did Pinto et al :
Our findings provide strong support for the involvement of multiple rare genic CNVs , both genome - wide and at specific loci , in ASD .
These findings , similar to those recently described in schizophrenia , suggest that at least some of these ASD CNVs ( and the genes that they affect ) are under purifying selection .
Genes previously implicated in ASD by rare variant findings have pointed to functional themes in ASD pathophysiology .
Molecules such as NRXN1 , NLGN3 / 4X and SHANK3 , localized presynaptically or at the post - synaptic density ( PSD ) , highlight maturation and function of glutamatergic synapses .
Our data reveal that SHANK2 , SYNGAP1 and DLGAP2 are new ASD loci that also encode proteins in the PSD .
We also found intellectual disability genes to be important in ASD .
Furthermore , our functional enrichment map identifies new groups such as GTPase / Ras , effectively expanding both the number and connectivity of modules that may be involved in ASD .
The next step will be to relate defects or patterns of alterations in these groups to ASD endophenotypes .
The combined identification of higher - penetrance rare variants and new biological pathways , including those identified in this study , may broaden the targets amenable to genetic testing and therapeutic intervention .
The problem is that none of this sort of research is easy , and none of it is likely to result in effective treatments for ASDs very soon .
Autism quacks and anti-vaccine zealots , however , ca n’t accept this .
Again , like Blaxill , they demonstrate binary thinking .
If a study does n’t find a single , clear - cut gene or small set of genes causing autism or ASDs 100 % of the time , then to them almost invariably the study is crap , autism is not genetic in origin , and vaccines ( or other “ environmental factors ” – not vaccines , you know , nudge , nudge , wink , wink ) cause autism .
They also seem completely oblivious to developmental biology .
It bothers them that a child with ASD appears normal at birth and then only manifests symptoms between the ages of 2 and 4 .
Anti-vaccine zealots who attack genetic linkage studies will frequently point this out as though this observation is a slam dunk argument against a genetic etiology for autism .
Development proceeds , however , according to predictable , sequential steps that are under genetic control , and genetic variations and abnormalities can have a profound impact on development that may not manifest itself until previous parts of the developmental program are complete .
For example , Tay - Sachs disease is one of thoes rare diseases for which a single gene is the known cause .
Babies with Tay - Sachs usually appear normal at birth and develop normally for the first six months of life .
Then the neurologic deterioration begins .
There are also a number of inborn errors of metabolism that do n’t manifest themselves at birth .
In other words , it ’s not unusual for purely genetic diseases to exhibit delayed manifestation of symptoms .
Otherwise , why would we need to test for phenylketonuria ( PKU ) shortly after birth ?
Antivaccine zealots also seem unable to understand that most chronic diseases and conditions with a strong genetic component are due to changes in activity of multiple genes , sometimes many genes .
Due to functional redundancy in our cells , there are also often multiple abnormalities that can produce similar phenotypes ; it is therefore not surprising that there might be many different gene abnormalities that contribute to ASDs .
Systems biology gives us the tools to start to understand these exceedingly complex processes , as Pinto et al did in the study under discussion and as my collaborators try to do for cancer .
The problem is that biology is really complex .
Frustratingly to those waiting for treatments , it is far more complex than even scientists realized before the Human Genome Project and the dawn of genomic medicine .
While it is possible–even likely –that there is an environmental component to ASDs , the evidence to date has not convincingly implicated any , except for , ironically enough given how anti-vaccine zealots believe that the MMR vaccine causes autism , maternal rubella infection while the fetus is still in utero , as a cause of autism .
Moreover , as P.Z. pointed out , no transient exposure or exposures to an external agent ( such as a vaccine ) is known to be able to produce such a consistent pattern of gene duplications and deletions in human cells like the sets detected in Pinto et al .
Thus far , the preponderance of evidence points to primarily a genetic cause for autism and ASDs , and Pinto et al is another solid study supporting a genetic basis for autism .
It also suggests potential cell signaling pathways that might be abnormal in autism and thus targets for therapeutic intervention .
That ’s all we can ask of such a study .
It does not rule out an environmental component , although this study is not consistent with vaccines as an etiology of autism .
More importantly , it has failed to provide any validating evidence for the frequently claimed abnormalities touted by autism biomeddlers , abnormalities allegedly targeted by all manner of quack nostroms , from chelation therapy to antioxidants to hyperbaric oxygen to “ detoxification . ”
Now remains the hard work of validating and replicating these findings and then figuring out which pathways can be targeted for therapy .
What I ’m afraid of now is that the quacks will look at the pathways identified by Pinto et al and try to come up with new pseudoscientific “ biomed treatments ” for autism based on these results , after ( of course ) “ showing ” how vaccine “ injury ” can create these same CNVs in children .
It would n’t surprise me if I were to see this sort of “ science ” presented at Autism One next year .
On the other hand , maybe not .
For quacks to try to use the results of Pinto et al to “ treat ” autism , they ’d first have to accept the results of the study .

Functional impact of global rare copy number variation in autism spectrum disorders Nature DOI : 10.1038/nature09146
The Senate financial overhaul package , which passed the Senate in a 59 - 39 vote on Thursday evening , would constitute the biggest overhaul of U.S. financial regulations since the 1930s .
The legislation , broadly , is designed to close the regulatory gaps and end the speculative trading practices that contributed to the 2008 financial market crisis .
Major components of the bill would :
- NEW REGULATORY AUTHORITY : Gives federal regulators new authority to seize and break up large troubled financial firms without taxpayers bailouts in cases where the firm 's collapse could destabilize the financial system .
Sets up a liquidation procedure run by the FDIC .
Management could be removed , with shareholders and unsecured creditors bearing losses .
Other provisions would make it harder for top executives at the failed firms to claim large compensation packages , and it would give the government power to limit payments for certain creditors of failed firms .
Treasury would supply funds to cover the up - front costs of winding down the failed firm .
-CONSUMER AGENCY : Would create a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau within the Federal Reserve , with rulemaking and some enforcement power over banks and non-banks that offer consumer financial products or services such as credit cards , mortgages and other loans .
The new watchdog would have authority to examine and enforce regulations for all mortgage - related businesses , large non -bank financial companies such as big payday lenders and consumer reporting companies , and for banks and credit unions with assets of more than $ 10 billion .
-DERIVATIVES : Would require the vast majority of all derivatives trading be executed on a public exchange as opposed to between banks and their customers as many contracts are currently ..
Most controversially , the bill would adopt language written by Sen. Blanche Lincoln ( D. , Ark. ) , that would compel any large commercial banks that have access to the Federal Reserves discount window to spin off their derivatives trading business .
The Fed , FDIC , Treasury as well as the banking industry have argued against this measure .
-FINANCIAL STABILITY COUNCIL : Would establish a new , nine - member Financial Stability Oversight Council , comprising existing regulators charged with monitoring and addressing system - wide risks to the nation 's financial stability .
Among its duties , the council would recommend to the Fed stricter capital , leverage and other rules for large , complex financial firms that are judged to threaten the financial system .
In extreme cases , would have the power to break up financial firms .
Well , is it ?
Super - niche single - item restaurants are nothing new in these parts — like This Little Piggy Had Roast Beef , the Meatball Shop , and Rice to Riches — but the Best Chocolate Cake in the World just might take the award for sheer chutzpah in naming .
We walked past its tiny Nolita storefront last weekend , and wondered where it gets off being so cocky .
This is the first American outlet of a São Paolo , Brazil - based mini-chain ( where it goes by the similarly direct name O Melhor Bolo de Chocolate de Mundo ) ; chef Carlos Bras Lopes ’s hopes his cake recipe , which he brought to Brazil after emigrating from Portugal , will enrapture New Yorkers just as much as it has South Americans when it opens this week .
Per the official website ( with thanks to Google Translate and a Portuguese - speaking friend of Grub Street ) , Bras ’s “ best chocolate cake in the world ” is actually three cakes of varying sweetness : a sugary cake made with 53 percent cocoa , a semisweet made with 70 percent , and — for those adventurous of palate — a bitter , zero - sugar version that ’s touted as being lower in calories .
All are variations on a recipe made “ without flour or baking powder … a confection made from a top - of - the - line Belgian chocolate mousse , ” which from pictures appears to be swirled together with meringue .
In Brazil , you can get your slice of cake with a glass of port , but according to Time Out , the American iteration will offer Counter Culture coffee and cold treats from Il Laboratorio del Gelato .

Beginning as a Climber . . .
Perry - Smith 's predilection for risk and his natural abilities as a climber surfaced early - one of his school mates at St. Paul 's mentions in correspondence that Oliver would walk across four inch beams over fifty feet above the ground .
Several years prior to his move to Dresden , he spent the summer at Bar Harbor , Maine , where - enthused by his grandmother 's tales of watching climbers in the Alps - he scrambled down a series of cliffs to the ocean .
It appears that he began climbing very soon after arriving in Dresden .
A pioneer of early routes there comments :
" On the first Sunday of May , 1902 , I climbed the Hinterer Ganskofel with a friend .
Suddenly I heard in the chimney leading to the peak a shower of curses and coughs and the word ' goddam ' .
In a few minutes a young man climbed out , hesitated and then greeted us and sat down on the other corner of the summit . . . .
The new arrival wore nailed boots , an English sports costume and a broad brimmed hat .
. . .
At the final wall he explained that in nailed boots he could not climb this alone .
I went to the top and offered him a rope for safety .
. . .
He introduced himself as Oliver Perry - Smith of Philadelphia , and said he was climbing here to train for ascents in the Alps . . . .
This was the beginning of a happy mountain companionship .
Every Sunday we went together and soon were after new climbs .
. . .
We went on to the Blosstock .
The beginning of the crack was funnel - shaped and difficult .
. . .
The next narrow chimney gave me no trouble , and , in a firm stance , I waited for Perry - Smith to follow .
His girth was much greater than mine . . . [ powerfully built , his companions described him as ' tall as a tree ' ] .
He tried with all his strength , but called that he must make a halt .
Suddenly I heard rhythmic bum - bum - bum .
At a distance of three meters the heartbeat of my friend was conducted through the rock ! " - Albert Kunze in Jahrbuch für Touristik , 1954 .
Albert Kunze
Perry - Smith went on to become one of the finest climbers in Europe , acknowledged by his German peers as a leader in the advancement of standards .
He also loved to drive his Bugatti at high speeds through the German countryside !

Organization(s ) Involved : AFGHAN NATIONAL ARMY , TALIBAN SOUTH
19 FEB 2008 , TFZ INTSUM 568 , GCTF
( SECRET // REL TO USA , ISAF , NATO ) ANA BDE CDR is Threatened by TB :
On 17FEB2008 at 2240L , the 205th ANA BDE Commander MG Jamaladin received a call from Taliban Commander Mullah Ezat .
Mullah Ezat told the ANA CDR to surrender and offered him $ 100,000 ( US ) to quit working for the Afghan Army .
Ezat also stated that he knows where the ANA CDR is from and knows his family .
The BDE CDR called the number that Mullah Ezat had called from but there was no answer ( Source Comment - this phone call has instilled fear into the new ANA BDE commander and made him much more cautious .
It is unlikely that the TB will follow through with their threats ; they are likely testing the new CDR ) .

Office Call between the Director General of National Directorate of Security and Commander of Regional Command - East
ATTENDEES :

Major General David Rodriguez Commander , Regional Command - East , ISAF
Mr. Hasas Director of Intelligence , National Directorate of Security

SUMMARY :
Security in Afghanistan
o The greatest concern for Director Saleh is security along the highways , particularly in Ghazni and Zabul , where he believes government officials cannot travel without security .
He believes that the shift in Taliban focus from attacks on district centers to attacks along the highways is attracting recruits who are not actually Taliban but use the name to gain legitimacy , increasing the perception of the size , scope and strength of the insurgency and demonstrating GIRoA weakness .
o Saleh believes that there has been noticeable progress in Wardak , but it will be temporary unless it is extended to Ghazni and Zabul , as well as other areas .
o Director Saleh 's second major concern is for attacks in the major population centers of Kabul , Herat , Kandahar , Jalalabad , and Masar - e - Sharif .
o MG Rodriguez reported that there have been over 100 small drug labs destroyed in Nangarhar , primarily in Achin , with no complaint from the locals , and that the 101st brought an additional helicopter battalion that would assist with efforts there .
o Saleh reported that the # 1 priority for the Afghan government is to fix the Ministry of Interior , indicating that the leadership was involved in considerable corruption .
He remarked that it would be up to the US to fix it .
He said he proposed to the British that they provide management classes .
Tag Ab
o Director Saleh says that BG Razaq will serve well over Tagab and is a good commander .
At the suggestion of putting an ANA force in Tagab , MG Rodriguez acknowledged the possibility of using the — — — — — .
o Saleh acknowledged that the — — — — Governor is active HiG , indicating concern .
o Saleh noted that — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — were all previously HiG who have turned Taliban , are not reconcilable , and must be " taken out " .
MG Rodriguez noted that there would be a meeting with the — — — — NDS to determine how to approach this issue .
Pakistan
o Saleh believes that Hekmatyar is a reemerging figure being pushed to become more politically active , and expects he will be more influential in 2008 and 2009 .
Saleh believes that it is in the best interest of Afghanistan for Hekmatyar to remain in his current position , and that his capture or reconciliation would destabilize Afghanistan , based on his influence in Wardak and parts of Kapisa .
They gave Hekmatyar 's last known address to ISI , but they did not action it and Saleh expects them to facilitate Hekmatyar 's move to another location .
o Saleh observed several actions by the Pakistan Military indicating their lack of will to commit to security operations in the FATA :
They have forces stationed at the port , where there is no immediate threat forces that could better serve along the border .
Following an ambush on a PAKMIL unit crossing the tunnel into North Waziristan about six weeks ago , the commander called Maulawi Ahmadjan to broker a peace with the insurgent force .
They lost control of Alizai last month and are not attempting to retake it because it is not in their interest , even though it is in their country .
They have asked the US to allow them time to clear each insurgent group , one by one , hoping that they will be allowed unlimited time in which the insurgents ' focus will turn away from Pakistan and toward Afghanistan .
They know where — — — — — — — — ( travels to Miram Shah and Peshawar ) and — — — — — — — are , but will not go after them .
o Saleh assessed that Pakistan ISI and the Army will work to ensure that a weak Prime Minister is installed to preclude conflict with Musharraf .
He described the wide - ranging control that the Army had throughout the government and industry , leaving little under the responsibility of the civilian government .
He noted that there would be little change until a civilian government had real control .
Saleh predicts that General Kiyani will take a more active leading role as he realizes the breadth of his power .
o Saleh sees potential for the Quetta Shura to weaken and noted that the Miram Shah shura has turned toward criminality .
" Enemies of Afghanistan " flip - book
o MG Rodriguez provided the prototype " Enemies of Afghanistan " targets booklet to Director Saleh , describing that it would be provided to ANP and that it could be updated in the future .
When asked if it should only include higher tier targets or all targets , Saleh said that it would be good to start with this version .
Secure Communication
o Saleh reported that he has discussed the — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — with GEN McNeill and MG Champoux and that ISAF is supposed work on it next week .
Logar NDS Chief
o MG Rodriguez reported that the new Logar NDS chief is working well with coalition and working to build trust with the ANA and ANP .
Release Requests
o Director Saleh reported that the Ministry of Defense and Ministry of Justice had confirmed that — — — — — — — — — — , who had been in US custody for 4 years and was reported to have been recently turned over to the ANDF , was not in Afghan custody , implying that he must still be in US custody .
MG Rodriguez said we would figure it out .
o MG Rodriguez reported that — — — — — — — — — would remain in US custody for further questioning .
Saleh had little reaction and did not seem concerned .
o Director Saleh asked that — — — — — — be released to the NDS in Kabul , rather than in Nangarhar , and said that he would personally take responsibility .
Request for Support
o Director Saleh reported that the Afghan government has taken responsibility for the NDS budget , previously handled by the CIA , which would likely result in a 30 % cut in the coming year .
Saleh asked that , if possibly , RC - East provide AK , 9 mm , and PKM ammunition ; any other supplies , such as boots ; and construction materials .
He said that if this was possible , he would send officers from the NDS logistics office to facilitate .

031300z TF 3 Fury reports Illegal Taxing of jingle trucks investigation IVO Stogun checkpoint , Zurmat District
On 03 March 2008 at approximately 1300 hours , while working with — — — — — — — — — , ANCOP ETT Team Chief , we received information from an Afghan truck driver that he had just been required to pay a bribe to a Zormat ANP patrolman at Stogan Check Point in Zormat District in order to pass through the check point .
I had my interpretor take the driver 's statement and translate it into english , read the statement back to the driver and had him sign and thumb print the statement .
— — — — — — — and I ask the driver if he would follow us back to Stogan Checkpoint and identify the patrolman he paid the bribe to and he agreed .
We drove to Stogan Checkpoint where approximatley six trucks were lined up waiting to pass through the checkpoint .
I had one of my interpretors ask each driver waiting in line to exit their vehicles and asked them if they had been required to pay any amount of money to pass through the checkpoint .
All six drivers stated that they had been required to pay various amounts of money to pass through .
— — — — — — — contacted MAJ Hussain , the ANCOP Chief of Police in Zormat , informed him of the situation and requested he come to Stogan Checkpoint .
While waiting for MAJ Hussain , I asked the seven patrolmen we detained to sit and relax while we sorted through a problem without ever mentioning why they were being detained .
Three of the patrolman responded by saying that they had only taken money from the truck drivers to buy fuel for their generator .
When MAJ Hussain arrived , he was accompanied by CPT — — — — , Operations Officer for the Zormat AUP .
MAJ
Hussain took written statements from the seven truck drivers claiming they were required to pay a bribe to pass through the checkpoint as they identified the patrolmen that they had paid the bribe to and stated how much money each was required to pay .
He then had his ANCOP search the person of each of the seven patrolmen being detained and found cash that was suspected to have been paid as a bribe on one or more of the patrolmen .
MAJ Hussain collected the statements and cash , arrested the seven suspected patrolmen and returned to the Zormat Police District Center , and lodged the seven suspects in the detention cells .
— — — — — — — and I contacted — — — — — — — — — — and — — — — — — — — — — to notify them of what had occurred .
— — — — — — — contacted — — — — — — — and I the next morning to notify us that special investigator from Paktia Provincial Headquarters were coming to Zormat to investigate .
On 05 March 2008 , after the ANCOP / Zormat AUP TOA had occurred and MAJ Hussain and the ANCOP had departed Zormat , the special investigators were preparing to go back to Gardez , — — — — — — — asked them what action they were going to take in the Stogan Checkpoint Police Corruption investigation .
They stated that they could take no action due to having no evidence .
At that time , — — — — — — — contact MAJ
Hussain by phone and asked him what he had done with the truck driver witness statements .
MAJ Hussain stated that he had turned the witness statements over to the Zormat AUP Detention Officer when he handed over custody of the suspected patrolment to him .
When the Detention Officer was asked what he had done with the witness statements , he claimed he never received them .

Meeting with Individual 's Name : — — — — — — — — — Individual 's Title : — — — — — — — — —
Discussion Items :
- Discussed how the weather will likely affect our helicopter flight to Jaji and Chamkani scheduled for tomorrow morning .
We anticipate at least a delay , if not cancellation .
We will keep him advised .
If it does not happen we discussed the possibility of a two day ground trip so he can stop at villages along the way and talk with people .
We also discussed taking one day trips to other districts and he is very interested in this .
- The PRT CDR informed him that his concerns about not being informed , nor coordinated with concerning the operation in Jaji have been sent up the chain of command .
He stated he is now willing to go to Jaji and talk to the people and ask them to cooperate with the searches for enemy personnel .
He would like MGen Khaliq to be there as well .
- In addition , some leaders from Jaji met with — — today here in Gardez .
They stated that there were tractors that have started leveling some land in the district and the villagers did not know why .
The — — — — — asked us if this was one of our projects .
We told him it was not a PRT project , but we would
check to see if other CF units may be doing something .
Apparently the land is disputed and construction should stop until ownership is resolved .
- We showed him the list of large projects we are considering focusing on developing proposals for and / or lobbying for funds for over the next few months and asked his opinion .
The projects were :
-- Armored vehicle(s ) for the governor
-- Hydro-Electric Plant in Ahmad Abad
-- Chormate mine in Zormat
-- Security wall for the Gardez University
-- Paving the Gardez - Chamkani - Patan - Pakistan road
-- Road clearing / maintenance equipment
-- Radio station in Zormat
-- Robat school near Gardez
-- Government motorpool
--
He stated that he would also like us to look into finding a way to get the radio station in Chamkani to reach into Jaji
--
He agreed with all the projects on the list , but felt that the mine would be very difficult and complicated and would take a lot to develop the infrastructure and processes to make it projective .
He would prefer we concentrate on something which will benefit the people sooner .
We told him our main goal of the mine project was to create long - term jobs .
He said he would discuss the issue with the people of Zormat and other districts to see if they had some ideas for projects that could create a lot of this type of jobs .
-- Discussed how it may be easier to get funding if we did the Gardez Pakistan road in phases , with the first phase being from Gardez to Sayed Karam .
He said this was a critical road because the majority of the provinces population lived along it so most would benefit from the project .
He also felt that its construction would give hope to the people because they would see the government and CF working for their benefit .
--
When prompted , he said his priorities from the list would be first the university security wall , then the hydro- electric plant , then the paving of the at least the first phase of the road .
He did not rank the others , but did mention that we should consider adding a clinic in Laji Mongal .
He also stated that he would prefer we spend the money on helping the people instead of protecting — — — ( note : he is being humble and showing his concern for — — — people over himself ; however it is this attitude that makes us want to do whatever we can to help keep him alive ) .
- — — — — — — stated that he has requested — — — — — — — be replaced due to corruption and ineffectiveness .
While we were there he received a list of potential replacements , but only their names were provided .
He knows nothing about the men , so he wasnt sure how useful the list was going to be in regards to — — — recommending a replacement .
He gave several examples of ineffectiveness :
--
The suicide bomber who struck the ANA / ETT convoy on 15 Dec sat on the bridge for some time waiting for a target of opportunity .
There is a police checkpoint on the Gardez side of the bridge , but they never checked out the vehicle
--
The police search all the vehicles that come up to the checkpoint on the north side of town , but do not search vehicles at the other main entrances to the city even through there are supposed to be checkpoints there .
At the one where they do search , they also charge a fee / bribe
-- The — — — — — told — — — — — — — to activate the checkpoints on all main roads leading into the city due to intel indicating that suicide bombers were heading for Gardez .
This order was given on 14 Dec .
The checkpoints were not manned and the attack happened the following day .
Still , most of them are not active .
- He stated he would get a letter from the MoPW pledging support for fuel and operator salaries regarding the road clearing / maintenance equipment .
- He is currently working with TLO to initiate a project in Ahamd Abad involving agriculture .
They hope this project will provide a lot of long - term jobs .
- We presented the HA pre-positioning plan for Paktya and explained where we were in stocking the supply points .
He was pleased with this effort and suggested that once the ANA base was built in Jaji , this would be another good place to pre-position supplies .
- We told him that some people had come to our gate claiming to be returnees living in tents over by the prison and that they were in need of HA .
He stated he had no knowledge of a returnee camp there and suspects that they were just looking for handouts .
He stated there were only two returnee camps , Bonozai and Robat .
We told him that we had a lot of clothing nd other items that have been donated by friends and family of service members back in the states .
We would like to take these items and other DoD provided HA supplies out to a returnee camp after the Christmas Holiday .
He said he would like to join us when we go and he would like to take the time to sit down and talk to them while we were there .
We agreed this would be best .
- We expressed our concern that when we conducted a follow - up check of the orphanage that we opened a couple weeks ago , we found very few orphans living there and could not find most of the HA we had given them .
He stated he was also concerned about what was going on over there and has no idea what they did with the money that he gave during the ribbon cutting which was supposed to be divided among the orphans .
He does not believe they got any benefit from the funds .
He also stated that he had only seen about 30 orphans , not the 102 that the orphanage director said lived there .
He said he would have the Director of Social Affairs follow - up .
- — — — — — — asked us if we had anything we could bring with us tomorrow to give to the people we meet with .
We decided to bring some prayer rugs and Korans that we have on hand .

Obama administration attorneys had argued that in administering federal benefits , the federal government has the right to require marriages are between a man and a woman .
That case is Gill v. Office of Personnel Management , which was litigated by attorneys for the Boston - based rights group Gay & Lesbian Advocates & Defenders ( GLAD ) .
“ GLAD is representing seven married gay couples and three surviving spouses from Massachusetts who have been denied federal benefits because of the 1996 law that defines marriage as a heterosexual union for federal agencies , ” gay advocacy Web site On Top noted .
Gill v. Office of Personnel Management is one of several cases expected to make it all the way to the Supreme Court of the United States , the electronic magazine added .
In another decision also issued Thursday , Judge Tauro noted that the Defense of Marriage Act , passed in 1996 during the Clinton administration , violated protections inherent to the 10th Amendment to the Constitution .
“ The federal government , by enacting and enforcing DOMA , plainly encroaches upon the firmly entrenched province of the state , and in doing so , offends the Tenth Amendment , ” he ruled , according to the AP .
“ For that reason , the statute is invalid . ”

That ruling came in a lawsuit filed by Massachusetts Attorney General Martha Coakley , who contended that legally married gay couples in Massachusetts had been unjustly denied federal benefits .
In a stroke of irony , the decision would appear to be not just a victory for gay rights advocates , but also for many conservatives to whom the 10th Amendment has become something of a rallying cry .
However , instead of emphasizing the 10th Amendment as a means of expanding their fellow citizens ’ civil rights , most of the so - called “ Tenthers ” who vehemently preach the text are opposed to gay marriage and raise their voices in objection to government spending and regulations on big business .
Whether conservatives will view the ruling as a victory for their favored portion of the constitution remains to be seen .

Industry Minister Tony Clement introduced two bills yesterday – the Fighting Internet and Wireless Spam Act ( C - 28 ) and the Safeguarding Canadians ' Personal Information Act ( C - 29 ) .
I have spoken positively about C - 28 ( here , here , and here ) , which is long overdue and should receive swift passage .
By contrast , C - 29 is a huge disappointment .
The bill is also long overdue as it features the amendments to Canadian private sector privacy law from a review that began in 2006 and concluded with a report in 2007 .
Just over three years later , the government has introduced a bill that does little for Canadians ' privacy , while providing new exceptions for businesses and new powers for law enforcement ( David Fraser has helpfully created a redline version of PIPEDA with the proposed changes ) .
The centrepiece of the bill is a new security breach disclosure provision , but the requirements are very weak when compared with similar laws found elsewhere .
In fact , with no penalties for failure to notify security breaches , the provisions may do more harm than good since Canadians will expect to receive notifications in the event of a breach , but companies may err on the side of not notifying ( given the very high threshold discussed below ) safe in the knowledge that there are no financial penalties for failing to do so .
The New Business Exceptions
The business exceptions address several issues :
The bill changes the definition of business contact information ( which is not treated as personal information ) by expressly including business email addresses .
This overturns a successful complaint I filed years ago against the ( now defunct ) Ottawa Renegades over their use of my email address .
The change further confirms that PIPEDA cannot be used in spam cases , but C - 28 should provide far more effective tools .
The bill establishes a new prospective business transaction exception that permits use and disclosure of personal information in various business transactions .
The provision creates some limits on the use of the information , but is designed to address concerns from the business community that PIPEDA could create barriers to mergers and acquisitions as well as other transactions .
The bill creates a new exception for the collection , use , and disclosure of personal information contained in a witness statement related to an insurance claim .
The bill creates a new work product exception for the collection , use , and disclosure for information produced by an individual in the course of the employment .
There is also an exception for the employer collection , use , and disclosure of employee information to " establish , manage or terminate an employment relationship . "
The bill creates a new exception for businesses that voluntarily disclose personal information to other organizations for the investigation the breach of an agreement that has been , is being , or is about to be committed .
This exception also extends to disclosure to " prevent , detect or suppress fraud . "
Law Enforcement Provisions
Law enforcement also benefits from new provisions , which could have a significant on businesses and individual Canadians .
The bill purports to clarify " lawful authority " ( ie. disclosure to lawful authority without a court order ) but as David Fraser notes it really does n't clarify much of anything .
Rather , it encourages disclosures without court oversight by confirming that businesses are not required to verify the validity of the lawful authority .
Once a business has disclosed personal information to law enforcement , the bill includes a provision blocking it from disclosing the disclosure to the affected individual .
This USA Patriot Act - like provision includes detailed rules on how such disclosures can occur , including mandatory delays and government notifications .
In other words , once a business has disclosed personal information , the bill strongly encourages it to keep its proverbial mouth shut .
Security Breach Disclosure
As for individuals , there is a notable clarification of the meaning of consent , but the big addition is the creation of a security breach disclosure requirement .
Unfortunately , the proposed approach is extremely weak when compared with similar statutes elsewhere .
The security breach requirements include :
A requirement to report an " material breach of security safeguards involving personal information under its control " to the Privacy Commissioner .
The organization determines whether the breach is material , having regard to the sensitivity of the information , the number of individuals affected , and whether there is a systemic problem .
A second requirement to report to individuals affected by the breach " if it is reasonable in the circumstances to believe that the breach creates a real risk of significant harm to the individual . "
The organization makes its own determination of whether there is a real risk having regard to the sensitivity of the information and the probability that the personal information has been , is being , or will be misused .
The notification must be given " as soon as feasible . "
Notifications may also go to other other organizations if doing so may reduce the risk of harm .
While this is better than the current situation where there is no security breach disclosure requirement , it is far less than the rules found elsewhere .
This proposal sets a very high threshold for disclosure , contains no clear penalties for non-disclosure , and does not feature a private right of action that might be used by individuals to further encourage compliance .
By comparison , the California law requires disclosure of any breach of unencrypted personal information that is reasonably believed to have been acquired by an unauthorized person .
In other words , the only threshold is whether an unauthorized person acquired the information , not whether there is real risk of significant harm ( other states merely require harm , not significant harm ) .
Moreover , the California law requires disclosure in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay – far quicker than the Canadian proposal .
Some states also establish tough penalties for failure to promptly notify .
For example , Florida 's law provides for penalties of up to $ 500,000 for failure to notify and up to $ 50,000 for failure to document non-notifications of security breaches .
Michigan 's penalties run up to $ 750,000 .
Moreover , some states ( such as Louisiana and New Hampshire ) establish private rights of action that provide for civil actions to recover actual damages sustained by individuals in cases of security breaches .
Proposed language in Canada from the Uniform Law Conference of Canada 's model data breach notification statute also envisions penalties for non-compliance ( though it also includes a " significant harm " threshold ) .
Security breach disclosure was widely recognized as a major hole in the Canadian law framework , yet this proposal is a major disappointment that falls far short of striking the right balance between protecting Canadians , encouraging appropriate safeguards of personal information , and guarding against overwhelming Canadians with too many notices .
When combined with the rest of the bill – which includes new exceptions for work product , new barriers to disclosing disclosures and further encourages disclosures without court oversight – C - 29 does not do nearly enough to advance the Canadian privacy law framework in a manner that actually protects personal privacy .
Wir essen , was uns die Industrie auftischt Eren Güvercin
Warum wir so unglaublich viel Essen in den Müll werfen und den Konsumenten in fettmachenden Umgebungen der qualitätsvolle Umgang mit Nahrungsmittel beinahe vollständig verloren gegangen ist .
Ein Gespräch mit Tanja Busse
Das Ziel muss sein , eine möglichst große Ernährungssouveränität zu erreichen , individuell , wie gemeinschaftlich , dafür plädiert Tanja Busse , die 2006 den aufgeklärten Konsumenten als „ gesellschaftliche Macht “ beschrieb .
Nun hat sich Busse , die gelegentlich auch eine Hommage an Weinkorken für Greenpeace verfasst , die " Ernährungsdiktatur " vorgeknöpft .
Telepolis sprach mit ihr .
Der ehemalige UN - Sonderberichterstatter für das Recht auf Nahrung , Jean Ziegler , sagt , dass ein Kind , das in einer Welt , die genug Lebensmittel produziert , an Hunger stirbt , ermordet wird .
Obwohl wir heute mehr Lebensmittel produzieren als je zuvor in der Geschichte der Menschheit , haben aber auch noch nie so viele gehungert wie heute .
Wie kann das überhaupt sein ?
Tanja Busse :
Es ist eine Menschheitskatastrophe , erstens , dass wir den Hunger zulassen und zweitens , dass es uns in den reichen Ländern kaum kümmert , dass Jahr für Jahr Millionen Menschen elendig zu Grunde gehen .
Die Gründe liegen unter anderem in der Dominanz der Ökonomie vor den Menschenrechten .
Den Akteuren aus der Wirtschaft ist es in den letzten Jahrzehnten gut gelungen , ihre Interessen politisch durchzusetzen , zum Beispiel durch Freihandelsabkommen etc .
Die Menschenrechte aber haben nicht so eine finanzstarke Lobby : Sie gelten nur formal , können aber nicht eingeklagt werden .
Das ändert sich nur ganz langsam , durch den beständigen Druck von Organisationen wie zum Beispiel FIAN .
Die Gründe für den Hunger sind vielfältig , und in vielen Fällen muss man auch den Regierungen der armen Länder eine Teilschuld zuweisen .
Doch Korruption oder Misswirtschaft in Entwicklungsländern dürfen nicht als Entschuldigung für unsere Untätigkeit gelten .
Die Industrieländer sind Mitverursacher des Hungers in den armen Ländern : Durch die Spekulation mit Agrarrohstoffen , durch massive Importe von Futtermitteln aus Ländern , in denen gehungert wird , durch die Förderung von Mais und Palmöl als Energiepflanzen , durch die Unterstützung korrupter Regierungen aus politischen Gründen , durch die erzwungene Einbindung der Landwirtschaft in das WTO - Regelwerk .
Das alles wird sich in den kommenden Jahren aller Wahrscheinlichkeit nach noch verstärken , weil der Klimawandel ausgerechnet denen , am meisten schaden wird , die ihn am wenigsten verursacht haben .
Preissprünge bei Lebensmitteln können künftig zum Sicherheitsproblem werden
Wie kann man diese Krankheit des Systems den Menschen bewusst machen ?
Besonders den Menschen im Westen , die von den Schattenseiten des Weltwirtschaftssystems direkt nicht betroffen sind ?
Tanja Busse :
Es gibt ja eine Reihe von Büchern , die auf diesen Zusammenhang hinweisen .
Und es gibt viele Aktivisten aus der Umwelt - oder Menschenrechtsbewegung , die immer wieder auf diese Ungerechtigkeit hinweisen .
Das Problem ist , dass die übliche Darstellung für uns leichter zu ertragen ist .
" Die armen Kinder in Afrika haben Hunger und wir sind so gütig und helfen ihnen mit Spenden ! " , dieser Gedanke fühlt sich natürlich besser an als die traurige Wahrheit : " Auch wir sind in diese Ungerechtigkeit verstrickt , wir essen den Armen den Teller leer ! "
Das ist nur schwer zu ertragen - vor allem , wenn man nicht recht weiß , was man dagegen tun soll .
Aber einigen Prognosen zufolge könnte sich das schnell ändern , dass wir in den reichen Ländern von den Schattenseiten nicht betroffen sind .
Der Klimawandel wird vermutlich viele Menschen aus ihrer Heimat vertreiben und zu Flüchtlingen machen .
Und die erwarteten Preissprünge bei Lebensmitteln werden auch zum Sicherheitsproblem werden .
Das heisst , langfristig werden auch wir diese Schattenseiten zu spüren bekommen .
Die Finanzkrise - eine Folge der politischen Unfähigkeit , funktionierende Regeln zu schaffen - hat uns ja gezeigt , wie verwundbar wird sind , wenn die Politik vor der Wirtschaft in die Knie geht .
Hat man als Konsument überhaupt die Wahl ?
In dem Untertitel Ihres Buches „ Ernährungsdiktatur “ heißt es , dass wir nicht länger essen dürfen , was uns die Industrie auftischt .
Hat man als Konsument überhaupt die Wahl ?
Wie kann man konkret etwas unternehmen ?
Tanja Busse : Man kann einen eigenen Gemüsegarten anlegen und versuche , sich selbst zu versorgen !
Das klingt wie ein lustiges kleines Experiment angesichts der bedrohlichen Lage , aber ich meine das durchaus ernst :
Denn wer auch nur auf einer winzigen Fläche eine winzige Menge Gemüse produziert , versteht , wie wertvoll Lebensmittel sind und wie viel Ressourcen dafür nötig sind , Boden , Wasser , Arbeitskraft .
Dieser Respekt ist uns im Überfluss der Konsumgesellschaft verloren gegangen .
Deshalb werfen wir so unglaublich viel Essen in den Müll .
Was man sonst noch tun kann : Weniger Fleisch ( und Milchprodukte ) essen , denn Fleischproduktion und Rinderhaltung verstärken den Klimawandel .
Und der Anbau von Futtermitteln für das Vieh steht in Konkurrenz zum Anbau von Lebensmitteln .
Und die Klassiker : Regional , saisonal und ökologisch essen !
Mehr kochen und weniger Fertigessen kaufen - um die Nahrungskompetenz nicht an große Konzerne zu verlieren !
Etikettenschwindel und die Macht des Einzelnen
Sie klagen den Etikettenschwindel in den Supermärkten an , und versuchen durch E - Mails die Lebensmittelindustrie bloß zu stellen .
Hat dies überhaupt Erfolg ?
Kann man dadurch etwas erreichen gegen die große Marketingmaschinerie der Konzerne ?
Tanja Busse : Ja , in einem
Fall ist es mir gelungen : Der Milchkonzern Campina hat eine Rote Grütze ohne Früchte verkauft , was laut Deutschem Lebensmittelgesetzbuch nicht geht .
Das habe ich dem zuständigen Chemischen und Veterinäruntersuchungsamt mitgeteilt , das mir erst antwortete , nein , das Etikett gehe in Ordnung , weil der Becher durchsichtig sei : Der Verbraucher könne also sehen , dass keine Früchte im Becher seien .
Das kam mir doch sehr absurd vor - warum gibt es denn dann ein Irrreführungsverbot , wenn man sich doch auf den Augenschein verlassen muss ?
Das habe ich die Behörde gefragt - und bekam die überraschende Antwort : Campina muss das Etikett ändern ( mehr dazu Ja , in einem Fall ist es mir gelungen : Der Milchkonzern Campina hat eine Rote Grütze ohne Früchte verkauft , was laut Deutschem Lebensmittelgesetzbuch nicht geht .
Das habe ich dem zuständigen Chemischen und Veterinäruntersuchungsamt mitgeteilt , das mir erst antwortete , nein , das Etikett gehe in Ordnung , weil der Becher durchsichtig sei : Der Verbraucher könne also sehen , dass keine Früchte im Becher seien .
Das kam mir doch sehr absurd vor - warum gibt es denn dann ein Irrreführungsverbot , wenn man sich doch auf den Augenschein verlassen muss ?
Das habe ich die Behörde gefragt - und bekam die überraschende Antwort : Campina muss das Etikett ändern ( mehr dazu hier ) .
Das zeigt , dass wir als Konsumenten durchaus etwas erreichen können !
Wir müssen uns nur wehren und den Behörden zeigen , dass wir uns nicht anlügen lassen wollen !
Je mehr Leute Protest - E- Mails schrieben , desto eher reagieren die Kontrolleure .
Fettmachende Umgebung
Sie schreiben in Ihrem Buch , dass nicht nur nie so viele gehungert haben wie heute , sondern dass auch nie so viele Menschen an Fettleibigkeit litten wie heute .
Ist es da nicht zu einfach , wenn man sagt , dass das die alleinige Schuld der Lebensmittelindustrie ist ?
Tanja Busse : Ja , das ist zu einfach .
Im Buch erläutere ich deshalb den Begriff " obesogenic environment " .
Das ist der Fachbegrifff der amerikanischen Fettleibigkeitsforscher für unsere fettmachende Umgebung .
Dabei kommen viele Faktoren zusammen : die genetische Veranlagung , die Lebensumstände und die emotionale Lage des Einzelnen , aber auch sein Umfeld und das Nahrungsangebot .
Wenn ich jemandem ständig Zuckerriegel und Chipstüten unter die Nase halte , wird er sehr viel eher so dick , dass er krank wird , als wenn er drei Mal am Tag gesunde Mahlzeiten bekäme , am Tisch mit Familie oder Freunden .
Die Lebensmittelindustrie aber hat ein ökonomisches Interesse daran , uns günstige Zutaten für viel Geld zu verkaufen , und das sind nun mal Dinge wie Snacks oder lange haltbare Fertigprodukte .
Unsere Gesellschaft hat leider entschieden , dass wir so gut wie überall von Werbung belästigt werden dürfen , das bringt besonders Kinder dazu , Plastikessen für etwas Leckeres , Tolles zu halten und ihr Geld dafür auszugeben .
Auch das verstärkt den Verfall .
Doch eigentlich könnte es anders gehen
Kann die Politik etwas gegen die „ Ernährungsdiktatur “ unternehmen ?
Tanja Busse : Klar könnte sie .
Wenn sie wollte .
Zum Beispiel das Irreführungsverbot in der Werbung durchsetzen .
Oder am besten gleich Werbung für ungesundes und überflüssiges Zeugs verbieten .
Überhaupt : Man könnte Kinder vor dem Kaufzwang schützen .
Dass Kinderfilme für Werbung unterbrochen werden , ist ein Kulturverlust , an den sich alle schon so gewöhnt haben , dass niemand etwas dagegen unternimmt .
Doch eigentlich könnte es anders gehen .
Eigentlich müssten Kinder die Chance haben , ihren eigenen Geschmack zu entwickeln , ohne dass ihnen ständig jemand vorsagt , dass sie Buntes , Eingepacktes und Aromatisiertes aus der Plastiktüte bevorzugen sollen , wenn sie cool sein wollen .
Weiter : Kantinen für Schulen , Kindergärten und andere öffentliche Einrichtungen fördern und dort regionales , saisonales Essen aus Bio-Anbau anbieten .
Und sie müsste die externen Kosten auf die Preise schlagen :
Wenn die ökologischen Schäden , die die industrialisierte Landwirtschaft anrichtet , auf die Preise aufgeschlagen würden , wären Bio-Lebensmittel nicht mehr teurer als die sogenannten " konventionellen " .
Dann gäbe es einen faireren Wettbewerb .
Die Politik müsste auch das Tierschutzgesetz durchsetzen :
Wenn ein privater Tierhalter seine
Tiere nicht füttert und tränkt , bekommt er sofort eine Strafe .
Viele Amtstierärzte stellen immer wieder fest , dass in der sogenannten Intensivgeflügelmast bis zu drei Prozent der Tiere so schnell gemästet werden , dass sie am Ende ihrer Mast nicht mehr zum Wasser und zum Futter laufen können - vor Schmerzen .
Das widerspricht dem gesetzlichen Verbot , Tiere zu quälen - und wird dennoch toleriert .
Und natürlich gibt es politischen Handlungsbedarf auf der globalen Ebene : Die Spekulation mit Agrargütern muss verboten werden , die Agrarstruktur muss in allen Ländern so ausgerichtet sein , dass zunächst die Bedürfnisse der Menschen befriedigt werden müssen .
Erst danach darf für den Export angebaut werden .
Das Ziel muss sein , eine möglichst große Ernährungssouveränität zu erreichen - wie das gehen könnte , steht im Weltagrarbericht , den die Bundesregierung aber nicht einmal unterzeichnen möchte .

Great nicknames are part of the lore and legend of professional hockey .
Everyone knows exactly who you 're talking about when you say " The Great One . "
Other great nicknames like ' The Dominator ' ( Dominik Hasek ) , The Mule ( Johan Franzen ) , The Hammer ( Dave Schultz ) , ' The Rocket ' ( Maurice Richard ) , and ' The Golden Jet ' ( Bobby Hull ) have become part of the colorful history of the game .
But , then there are a few old time hockey nicknames that seem quaint or even a little strange by today 's standards .
Here are ten of the old timer oddballs :
10 . Bernie Nicholls -- The Pumper Nicholl Kid
Now we have ' Sid the Kid ' , but not many jocks named after bakery products .
9 .
-- Dipsy - Doodle - Dandy
Today that would be shortened to ' Triple D ' and he'd be dating a celebrity .
8 .
-- The Honest Brakeman
Back when teams rode the rails this might have had more meaning .
One of the final cuts when they were forming the " The Village People . "
7 .
-- Peanuts
Talk about a salary cap .
Peanuts received his nickname when a Toronto sports writer spotted him selling peanuts at Maple Leaf Gardens in 1933 .
Derek Jeter has endorsed ' Skippy ' peanut butter , but does anyone call him ' Skippy ' ?
6 .
- Fido
Before someone let the mad dogs of the modern NHL out , you just had a ' Fido ' on the ice .
If Cliff wanted to be named after a dog ' Pooch Purpur ' would have had a better ring to it .
5 .
-- The Pembroke Peach
Getting named after a fruit would n't be politically correct these days .
4 .
-- Bun
So did his teammates just call him ' Bun ' or the more formal ' Bun Cook ' ?
Back in the day a bun was just something a hot dog went on .
Bun Cook was part of the Bread Line with his brother Bill Cook and Frank Boucher .
There 's the bakery again .
Could teammates use a nickname like that today and not giggle ?
It would have been fun to hear it if the fans really got after him .
3 .
-- Old Poison
Rumor was that Nels liked to eat baked beans flavored with extra lard before every game .
. .
2 .
-- Little Beaver
It 's unclear how Marcel earned this nickname .
Modern announcers would be a little wary of calling a Dionne game .
1 .
-- The Chicoutimi Cucumber ( French : ' Le Concombre de Chicoutimi ' )
Yes , this is the same Vézina that the NHL's ' The Vezina Trophy , ' awarded annually to the league 's best goaltender , is named after .
The A - Rod or Big Unit of his day .
Maybe they should rename the trophy ' The Cucumber Cup . '
The award 's vegetative namesake would then have a higher IQ than this last season 's winner , Marty Brodeur .
Apparently it was was Vézina 's cool and calm demeanor which earned him the nickname ' The Chicoutimi Cucumber . '
However , the French version of the nickname : " Le Concombre de Chicoutimi " sounds awfully romantic .
And it seems a little odd that an English expression , ' cool as a cumcumber , ' would serve as the foundation for a nickname of a great French - Canadian goaltender .
Perhaps those wily Frenchmen have pulled a fast one on all of us .

Appeal court rejects argument that London mayor had no right to evict demonstrators because he did not own the land
The Parliament Square peace protesters today lost their legal challenge against eviction , and " Democracy Village " , the ramshackle camp they have occupied since May Day , in the shadow of the Palace of Westminster , could now be cleared within days .
A spokesperson for Boris Johnson , the Mayor of London , appealed to the campers to respect the rulings and leave the site peacefully – an outcome some fear is unlikely , given the mixture of temperaments and causes represented in the camp .
The site was due to be cleared a fortnight ago , but the eviction notices were suspended pending the appeal .
The appeal court judges upheld the high court judgement granted to the mayor last month outlawing the camp , and rejected the argument that he had no right to evict the demonstrators because he did not own the land , which belongs to the Queen , and had failed to prove any legal title to it .
The campers ' lawyers also argued an eviction order would be contrary to the rights to free speech and free assembly .
However , in a decision announced today , the judges , Master of the Rolls Lord Neuberger , Lady Justice Arden and Lord Justice Sir Stanley Burnton , upheld the original ruling that Parliament Square Gardens was an open space , which the public had a right to use .
A spokesperson for the mayor said : " In the case of the ' Democracy Village ' protesters , the mayor is pleased that the court of appeal has supported the high court 's decision that there are no grounds to appeal in this case and to return possession of Parliament Square Gardens to the GLA .
The mayor has won on all points made in his claim , and all defences failed , vindicating his position .
" The Mayor respects the right to demonstrate – however , the scale and impact of the protest , which has gone on since 1 May , has caused considerable damage to the square – which sits alongside a world heritage site – and has prevented its peaceful use by other Londoners , including those who may have wished to conduct an authorised protest . "
The ruling does not affect the original camper , Brian Haw , who has lived in the square since 2001 : his own website is at pains to point out that he has " no connection or affiliation whatsoever " with the " Democracy Village " campers .
Many of the original campers , demonstrating against the war in Afghanistan and a rainbow of other causes , including BP and climate change , have moved off since the June court verdict , but their places have been taken by a number of new arrivals , including some homeless people delighted to find congenial company and regular communal meals in the heart of the capital .
Although the mayor has argued that the camp is an eyesore and off - putting to tourists , a steady stream of tourists arrives every day to photograph one another against the colourful banners and the now rather wind - battered vegetable garden .
If 2010 was a literary year of big names — featuring Franzen , Mitchell , Delillo and McEwan to name just a few — 2011 is lining up to be more subtle .
Amid a very full lineup of intriguing forthcoming books , just one stands above the rest in terms of hype and anticipation , a literary peak that ’s likely to be bittersweet in the form of the posthumous release of David Foster Wallace ’s final novel .
Readers will be hoping it does justice to his legacy .
In the shadow this big book are many others likely to be deserving of readers ’ time .
While 2010 was given over to the headliners , 2011 may be a year of new discoveries .
Here are some of the books we ’re looking forward to — 8,000 words strong and encompassing 76 titles , this is the only 2011 book preview you will ever need .
January or Already Out :
Gryphon by Charles Baxter : A collection of short fiction from an acknowledged master of the form .
Seven of the twenty - three stories in the collection are new ; others , including the title story , are considered classics .
In each of these pieces , Publisher ’s Weekly writes in a starred review , “ the acutely observed real world is rocked by the exotic or surreal . ”
Baxter ’s previous works include four novels ( including a National Book Award nominee , The Feast of Love ) and four prior short story collections .
( Emily M. )
The Empty Family by Colm Tóibín : Tóibín follows up his wildly successful 2009 novel Brooklyn with a new collection of nine short stories concerned with love and loss , memory and homecoming .
The Telegraph has called this collection “ exquisite and almost excruciating . ” ( Emily M. )
While Mortals Sleep by Kurt Vonnegut :
In the four years since his death , the Vonnegut vaults have been raided , yielding 2008 ’s Armageddon in Retrospect and 2009 ’s Look at the Birdie .
Now comes While Mortals Sleep , 16 more unpublished pieces described by Delacorte Press as “ a present left behind by a departed loved one . ”
Perhaps .
But Vonnegut ’s short fiction was generally uneven , and one might be forgiven for wondering how many more presents there are .
Because the further we move from his passing , the further we move from his best .
Dave Eggers , in the book ’s foreword , calls Vonnegut “ a hippie Mark Twain ” ; he is also in some danger of becoming a dorm - lit Tupac Shakur .
( Jacob )
Night Soul and Other Stories by Joseph McElroy : Underappreciated master McElroy is known ( and loved ) for the challenging body of work , and these stories are n’t likely to disappoint his fans , though they may have come across some of them before .
The oldest story in this collection of 12 dates back to 1981 and the title story was first published in 1982 .
But seven of them are reportedly from the last decade , including one “ The Campaign Trail ” which one early review describes as imagining “ the 2008 Democratic presidential primary much like a Matthew Barney film of the subject might : unnamed figures representing Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama ceremonially confront each other in a wild area of what once was Canada . ” ( Max )
February :
Swamplandia ! by Karen Russell : Swamplandia ! is the first novel from New Yorker “ 20 Under 40 ” writer Karen Russell .
It builds out of a short story from her 2006 collection St. Lucy ’s Home for Girls Raised by Wolves and tells the tale of the Bigtree family , operators of an alligator wrestling tourist attraction deep in the Everglades .
The family business is imperiled when the star ‘ gator grappler dies , setting off a chain of catastrophes that lead 12 - year - old Ava Bigtree to set off through the swamp in search of her lost sister Osceola .

Townie : A Memoir by Andre Dubus III : Andre Dubus III , of The House of Sand and Fog fame , grew up poor and hard in a Massachusetts mill town .
His famous father , the late great short story writer Andre Dubus was AWOL , chasing younger tail , leaving Dubus and his three siblings to the care of their loving but overworked mother .
The Townie is Dubus ’s memoir of growing up and learning to fight before he learned to write .
Advance word coming out of Kirkus and Booklist suggests this is going to be a good one .

When the Killing ’s Done by T.C. Boyle :
In his thirteenth novel , T.C. Boyle turns his attention to the Channel Islands off the coast of Santa Barbara and the practice of killing non-native fauna in an effort to protect the original ecosystem .
A starred review in Booklist says , “ Incisive and caustically witty , Boyle is fluent in evolutionary biology and island biogeography , cognizant of the shared emotions of all sentient beings , in awe over nature ’s crushing power , and , by turns , bemused and appalled by human perversity . ” ( Edan )
The Strange Case of Edward Gorey by Alexander Theroux : Originally published in paperback in 2000 , this biography of writer and illustrator Edward Gorey is being reissued by Fantagraphics Books in a new hardcover edition .
Gorey was a reclusive , enigmatic figure who never married , professed asexuality in interviews , and became famous for a twisted and faintly ominous body of work — marked by a distinctive Victorian Gothic sensibility — that includes an alphabet book of dead children ( “ A is for Amy who fell down the stairs . ” )
Alexander Theroux was Gorey ’s friend and neighbor for more than a quarter century .
Part biography , part artistic analysis , and part memoir of a long friendship , with exclusive interviews conducted shortly before Gorey ’s death , this book is generally accepted as the most comprehensive portrait of Gorey ever written .

Mr. Chartwell by Rebecca Hunt : Perhaps you are aware that Winston Churchill called his spells of depression “ black dog ” ?
Well , Mr. Chartwell is that black dog–literally , he ’s a man-sized , ill - intentioned black laborador .
In Rebecca Hunt ’s fabular first novel , Mr. Chartwell rents a room in a terrace in Battersea from a recently widowed young librarian named Esther Hammerhans : the black dog has business with the widow and with the war - weary Prime Minister .
British reviewers have been quite taken with the book ’s whimsy and its muscular grappling with the nature of depression — through the stinking , canine bulk of Chartwell himself and the dark philosophy he whispers such that only his intended victim can hear .

The Illumination : A Novel by Kevin Brockmeier : A new novel from the author of A Brief History of the Dead asks the question :
What if our pain is the most beautiful thing about us ?
On a particular Friday night at 8:17 pm , the Illumination commences : wounds and bruises begin to radiate light , to glimmer and shine .
The Illumination follows the journey of a private book , a journal of love notes written by a man for his wife .
The journal passes into the hands of a hospital patient following a lethal accident , and as it passes from hand to hand — to a data analyst , a photojournalist , a child , a missionary , a writer , a street vendor — the recipients find their lives subtly altered by their possession of the book .

Portraits of a Marriage by Sándor Márai : Sándor Márai is one of those novelists , like Irène Némirovsky , about whom those of us in the English - speaking community tend to employ words like “ discovered , ” as if they were an obscure wine of quality unearthed in a Parisian basement .
When Márai killed himself in 1989 in San Diego , shortly before his books began being translated to English , it ’s true that his status as a great mind of an imperial age was probably unknown to the gang at his local Circle K. However , the ( Austro - ) Hungarian novelist was one of the premier authors of his milieu–Budapest before World War II–and English readers are the redeemed rather than the redeemers now that we can finally read his beautiful novels .
Portraits of a Marriage is a chronicle of a relationship and an era on the way out .

West of Here by Jonathan Evison : Evison ’s new novel is the # 1 Indie Next pick for February , meaning that independent booksellers across the United States have voted it their favorite of all the books scheduled for publication that month .
Set in a fictional town on the Pacific coast of Washington State , West of Here moves back and forth in time between the stories of the town ’s founders in the late 1890s , and the lives of their descendants in 2005 .
It ’s a structure that allows for a remarkably deep sense of history and place , and Evison handles the sweeping scope of his narrative masterfully .
( Emily M. )
The Evolution of Bruno Littlemore by Benjamin Hale :
In this buzzed - about debut novel from Twelve Books , the eponymous hero is a chimpanzee who has learned to speak , read , and enjoy the visual arts , among other human endeavors .
There is apparently interspecies love ( and sex ! ) in the book , and the jacket copy declares that it goes beyond satire “ … by showing us not what it means , but what it feels like be human — to love and lose , learn , aspire , grasp , and , in the end , to fail . ”
A bookseller at legendary West Hollywood indie bookstore Book Soup has raved to me about the novel ’s inventiveness and its beautiful , beautiful prose .

Other People We Married by Emma Straub :
This debut collection of stories is one of the first books being printed by FiveChapters Books , the new publishing imprint of the popular website FiveChapters , which publishes a story a week in five installments .
Straub inaugurated the New Novella series for Flatmancrooked Press with her much - praised novella , Fly - Over State , and she proved that with the internet and some good old fashioned charm , an unknown author can sell books and win hearts .
Straub ’s new book includes that novella as well as eleven other stories .
Straub has been compared to Lorrie Moore for her humor and playful wit , and Moore herself has called this debut collection , “ A revelation . ” ( Edan )
March :
The Late American Novel : Writers on the Future of Books edited by C. Max Magee and Jeff Martin : Yes , there ’s certainly a conflict of interest in naming my book one of the year ’s most anticipated , but what ’s the point of having a website if I ca n’t use it to self - promote ?
And anyway , if my co-editor Jeff and I had an ideal reader in mind when we put together this collection , it was the Millions reader , passionate about books and reading and thoughtful about the future of this pastime as it intersects with the onslaught of technology .
The essays we managed to gather here are illuminating , entertaining , funny , and poignant , and taken together they form a collection that is ( dare I say ) essential for the reader and writer invested in books at this critical and curious moment in their long history .
Along with appearances by Millions staffers Garth Risk Hallberg , Emily St. John Mandel , and Sonya Chung and an introduction by me and my co-editor , this collection includes pieces by Jonathan Lethem , Reif Larsen , Elizabeth Crane Victor LaValle , Ander Monson , Tom Piazza , Lauren Groff , Benjamin Kunkel , Clancy Martin , Joe Meno , Rivka Galchen , and several others .
All you technophiles : Consider making this the last physical book you ever buy .
All you technophobes :
This might be a good candidate for the first ebook you ever own .

You Think That ’s Bad by Jim Shepard : Jim Shepard will once again dazzle us with his talent for universalizing the highly particular .
According to the publisher , the stories in this new collection , like those of his National Book Award nominated Like You ’d Understand Anyway , “ traverse centuries , continents , and social strata , ” featuring , among others , an Alpine researcher , a French nobleman ’s manservant , a woman traveling the Arabian deserts to track an ancient Shia sect , and the inventor of the Godzilla epics .
Further , Shepard culls “ the vastness of experience — from its bizarre fringes and breathtaking pinnacles to the mediocre and desperately below average . ”
Easier said than done , and Shepard is a master .
One of the stories , “ Boys Town , ” appeared in the November 10 issue of the New Yorker .

The Tiger ’s Wife by Tea Obreht : Of all The New Yorker ’s choices for the “ 20 Under 40 ” list , none was more surprising than Obreht , the youngest on the list and the only author chosen who had not yet published a book .
That changes in March with the publication of her debut novel The Tiger ’s Wife .
The novel follows a young doctor , Natalia , as she travels to a war - torn Balkan country to work at an orphanage .
But Natalia is also in search of answers – specifically , what happened to her grandfather , who has died recently .
With blurbs from T.C. Boyle , Ann Patchett , and recent National Book Award winner Colum McCann already secured , expectations are high for this literary debut .
( Patrick )
At the Fights : American Writers on Boxing from Library of America edited by George Kimball and John Schulian : Boxing writing inhabits a curious niche , resting at the juncture of sports journalism and noir .
Perhaps “ resting ” is the wrong word , as the genre ’s best examples rush toward victory or loss ; even away from the arena , motion remains the thing .
In a recent Irish Times article , Kimball described a 1954 John Lardner piece as At the Fights ’ “ cornerstone , ” and delivered its opening line : “ Stanley Ketchel was 24 years old when he was fatally shot in the back by the common - law husband of the lady who was cooking his breakfast . ”
Also on the card : Talese , Mailer , Mencken , and many , many others .

Unfamiliar Fishes by Sarah Vowell : “ I ’m better with dead people … than the living , ” claims Sarah Vowell , only half joking .
Her books often deal with historical figures , in most cases , long - dead and overlooked .
In Assassination Vacation she chronicled her travels while researching the murders of Presidents Lincoln , Garfield , and McKinley .
Details such as Garfield ’s assassin bursting into song during trial coated the history lessons with a good dose of social intrigue .
Vowell ’s latest , Unfamiliar Fishes , was borne out of a fascination with American Imperialism in 1898 , a year when the U.S , annexed Hawaii , invaded Cuba and the Philippines , and acquired Guam and Puerto Rico .
Vowell follows the Americanization of Hawaii from its first missionary settlers to the overthrow of its monarchy and later annexation .
A quote exemplary of Vowell ’s humor , to prep you for reading : “ They still love their last queen , celebrate her birthday , drape her statue with leis .
It can be a traditional , reverent place .
And I am a smart - alecky libertine . ”

Otherwise Known as the Human Condition : Selected Essays and Reviews by Geoff Dyer : Dyer has a gained a reputation as one of our most inventive essayists ( not to mention novelists ) .
Dyer delights in bending genres and subverting expectations , and covering a 25 - year span , this collection will likely showcase Dyer ’s impressive range .
The book , published by indie Graywolf , appears to have at least some overlap with a British collection that came out last year under the title Working the Room .
The Guardian called Dyer “ the most productive of slackers ” and described the British collection as seeming to be “ constructed as a vague quest .
You move through the unusually lit rooms of the author ’s fascinations . ” ( Max )
All the Time in the World : New and Selected Stories by E.L. Doctorow :
When a new story collection arrives from an elder master , one is eager to know the balance of “ new ” versus “ selected , ” who has done the selecting , and by what criteria .
But Random
House has revealed little as of yet .
We do know that six of the stories have never before appeared in book form ; the title story appeared in the winter ’09 issue of the Kenyon Review .
Doctorow is the author of 11 novels , and I for one hate to think the release of this collection signals a denouement in his novel production .
On January 6 , Doctorow turns 80 – happy birthday , ELD ; may this be a productive year for you , for all our sakes .

Pym by Mat Johnson : Eager readers of Edgar Allan Poe , having dispatched his short stories may have then turned to his hauntingly weird novel The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket .
As I noted a few years back , the book has been an inspiration for generations of adventure and science - fiction writers and has maintained a cultish allure to this day .
It is into this milieu that Johnson ’s Pym arrives .
Johnson wrote a pair of well regarded literary novels in the early part of last decade , turned to comics , and is now returning novels with this tale of a literature professor obsessed with the Pym tale , believing it to be true , and tracing the the journey of the doomed sailor to see what secrets might be unlocked .

Day of the Oprichnik by Vladimir Sorokin :
The scenes of sodomy between Stalin and Krushchev in Vladimir Sorokin ’s novel Blue Lard incurred charges of pornography and sparked protests , which included protestors wearing latex gloves while tossing flowers and copies of Sorokin ’s books into a papier mâché toilet .
Another novel of Sorokin ’s ( The Norm ) depicts a Russian society where coprophagy is a la mode and only outcasts and outsiders refuse to partake .
Needless to say , Sorokin ’s fiction is n’t restrained in its critique of contemporary Russian society .
His commentary continues in his latest novel , Day of the Oprichnik , where the ruling classes incorporate futuristic technology alongside the governing strategies of Ivan the Terrible .
As Sorokin describes : “ I just imagined what would happen to Russia if it isolated itself completely from the Western world –that is , if it erected a new Iron Curtain … .
This would mean that Russia would be overtaken by its past , and our past would be our future . ”
( Anne )
This Vacant Paradise by Victoria Patterson : Victoria Patterson follows her acclaimed debut story collection Drift with a novel – her first – set in the posh environs of 1990s Newport Beach , California .
As the title suggests , Patterson ’s novel promises a social critique of the often vapid , money - laden 90s .
It follows the beautiful but aging Esther Wilson as she attempts to navigate life without the aid of a wealthy man on her arm .
Drift was a finalist for both the California Book Award and the Story Prize .

The Art of Asking Your Boss for a Raise by Georges Perec : Georges Perec wrote : “ for us , who continue to have to do with a human race that insists on thinking , writing and above all publishing , the increasing size of our libraries tends to become one real problem . ”
We readers will have to deal with the fortunate burden of clearing shelf - space for another novel by Perec this spring , with the first English translation of The Art of Asking Your Boss for a Raise .
The novel depicts an office underling ’s attempts to ingratiate himself to his corporate superiors , while his neuroses expand a la Woody Allen .
If Perec ’s astutely observed yet darkly comical catalogue of managing directors , magnates , and heads of state in his essay “ The Holy of Holies ” is any indication , this “ account of the office worker ’s mindset ” will offset the disorder it imposes .

April :
The Pale King by David Foster Wallace : When David Foster Wallace died in 2008 , he left behind a huge , fragmentary manuscript set in and around a Midwestern IRS office and featuring a character named David Wallace .
The manuscript , quixotically , takes monotony as its master - trope , much as Infinite Jest used “ entertainment . ”
Since then , Michael Pietsch , Wallace ’s real - life editor , has been working to arrange the fragments in book form .
Published excerpts of varying degrees of sublimity – reportedly including two stories from Oblivion – offer glimpses of a Jest - like complex of supporting characters .
But these beleaguered office workers have more in common with the denizens of the Ennet House Drug and Alcohol Recovery House ( redundancy sic ) than with the Enfield Tennis Academy ’s student - athletes .
A note , quoted in D.T. Max ’s New Yorker piece , hints at the gift Wallace wanted to give his characters : “ Bliss – a - second - by - second joy and gratitude at the gift of being alive , conscious – lies on the other side of crushing , crushing boredom . ”
For readers still mourning the books he did n’t get to write , may it be so .
( Garth )
The Free World : A Novel by David Bezmozgis : Another debut novel from a Twenty - Under - Forty ’er , Bezmogis ’
The Free World tells the story of three generations of the Krasnansky family as they try to escape Communist Russia for the United States .
They are waylaid in Rome where the characters pursue different paths through the underbelly of their adopted city , ultimately bringing them into tension with each other as they grapple with a merciless immigration system and try to decide the family ’s fate .
( Kevin )
The Great Night by Chris Adrian : Chris Adrian ’s last novel , The Children ’s Hospital , showed him to be a writer of immense daring , curiosity , and heart .
Along with two other books , it earned him a spot ( by a whisker – he ’s now 40 ) on The New Yorker ’s “ 20 Under 40 List . ”
His new book The Great Night , looks back to one of magical realism ’s forebears : Shakespeare .
It ’s a retelling of A Midsummer Night ’s Dream , set in modern - day San Francisco ’s Buena Vista Park .
( Garth )
Someday This Will Be Funny by Lynne Tillman :
As if the publication of Lynne Tillman ’s first book of short stories in nearly ten years–and her first book following her stand - out novel , American Genius : A Comedy–were n’t enough to celebrate , Tillman ’s Someday This Will Be Funny also marks the debut of Richard Nash ’s new publishing venture , Cursor .
If Nash ’s reading list , interviews , and speeches are any indication , Cursor will take publishing one giant leap into the future , with Tillman ’s book at the forefront .
Tillman ’s new collection features appearances by Madame Realism , Marvin Gaye , and Clarence Thomas and incorporates epistle , quotation , and haiku as the stories “ bounce between lyrical passages of lucid beauty , echoing the scattered , cycling arpeggio of Tillman ’s preferred subject : the unsettled mind . ”
Tillman once said in an interview : “ Writers are promiscuous with experience , absolutely . ”
She ’s a woman of her word , and of the word .
Hear , hear !

Between Parentheses : Essays , Articles and Speeches 1998 - 2003 by Roberto Bolaño : Anyone who read “ Literature + Illness = Illness ” or “ Myths of Chulu ” in last year ’s collection The Insufferable Gaucho can attest that a Bolaño essay no more resembles Montaigne than a Bolaño novel resembles Samuel Richardson .
Indeed , the closest cousin of Bolaño ’s nonfiction may be his fiction , and in some cases it ’s hard to tell which is which .
Confusion over the genre of the short piece “ The Beach ” ( essay ? story ? ) seems to have been the source of the misconception that Bolaño was a recovering junkie .
Either way , though , it ’s phenomenal writing – a single , extended , coruscating sentence – and it appears in this Natasha Wimmer translation of a 2004 Anagrama volume , along with 340 other pages of uncollected , unclassifiable Bolaño .
( Garth )
The Tragedy of Arthur by Arthur Phillips : Phillips has n’t quite recaptured the buzz that accompanied Prague his debut novel about expats in Budapest , but this new book just may .
“ The Tragedy of Arthur ” is a fictional ( or is it ? ) , lost Shakespeare play about King Arthur and it is accompanied by a long introduction penned by a character ( or is it the author ? ) named Arthur Phillips .
Intertextual games ensue .
( Max )
The Long Goodbye by Meghan O’Rourke :
In another memoir about grief , O’Rourke draws on her dual patrimonies as a poet and cultural critic .
The result is a searching account of losing her mother to cancer .
O’Rourke finds herself blindsided by her own grief and bewildered by her inability to “ share ” it .
Even as she documents her own feelings , she examines the changing cultural role of grief , and comes to long for the mourning rituals that are even now vanishing .
The interplay of the objective and the subjective here speaks to audiences of both Oprah and The New Yorker , where the book was excerpted .
( Garth )
The Basement of the Ivory Tower by Professor X : To begin , a short exemplary excerpt from Professor X’s manifesto against higher education for all : “ America , ever - idealistic , seems wary of the vocational - education track .
We are not comfortable limiting anyone ’s options .
Telling someone that college is not for him seems harsh and classist and British , as though we were sentencing him to a life in the coal mines .
I sympathize with this stance ; I subscribe to the American ideal .
Unfortunately , it is with me and my red pen that that ideal crashes and burns . ”
And let me tell you ( because I have wielded that red pen and know Professor X’s bloody business : adjuncting and community college teaching ) it is a sad , sad world out there in America ’s lesser colleges , many as crassly business - minded as Walmart and utterly delighted to have students who are n’t cut out to make the grade .
Of course , liberal - minded idealists will object and cry Barbara Covett !
at the likes of Professor X , but having been in his trench , I know how deeply painful and demoralizing — and pointless and dishonest — it is to teach college - level curriculum to those who are not equipped for high school :
It ’s like trying to teach the legless to dance .
This is another commentary on the shoddy state of American higher education ( see also , most recently , Ed Dante ’s “ Shadow Scholar ” piece at The Chronicle of Higher Ed ) — sure to be an incendiary little book .
( Emily W. )
The Uncoupling by Meg Wolitzer : Wolitzer ’s ninth novel is inspired by Lysistrata , the ancient Greek play wherein the women withhold sex from their menfolk until they agree to end their war .
In Wolitzer ’s novel , a New Jersey high school puts on a production of the play , and soon , the females in the town lose interest in coupling with their men .
The Uncoupling follows Wolitzer ’s bestselling novel The Ten Year Nap , about the lives of stay - at - home mothers in New York City , and I hope her latest is as funny , readable and wise as that book was .
( Edan )
Fire Season by Philip Connors :
This debut nonfiction effort by Connors is an account of his time spent over part of each of the last ten years as a fire lookout in New Mexico in a 7 ′ x 7 ′ tower .
Connors also happens to be a literary critic and journalist whose writing has been fairly extensively published , including book reviews in the LRB and VQR .
Some of his most powerful work has taken the form of diaries , including one in n+1 that recounts his brother ’s suicide and another in The Paris Review about life as a fire lookout .
The book takes the diary form and expands on it , with five long chapters , each one dedicated to a month he spends in the lookout tower each year .

My New American Life by Francine Prose : Francine Prose , former National Book Award finalist and prolific producer of novels , short stories , children ’s books and nonfiction , will take us on a fictional tour of the bad old days of Bush - Cheney .
My New American
Life spins around Lula , a 26 - year - old Albanian living in New York City on an expiring tourist visa .
When she lands a job as a caretaker for a rebellious teenager in suburban New Jersey , she begins to live the American dream — until her brothers show up in a black Lexus SUV , a jarring reminder that family and history are always with us .
The novel , according to the publisher ’s jacket copy , captures the moment when American “ dreams and ideals gave way to a culture of cynicism , lies and fear . ” ( Bill )
Swim Back to Me by Ann Packer : Ann Packer , who first burst onto the scene in 2002 with her blockbuster debut The Dive from Clausen ’s Pier , returns with a fourth book .
Kirkus describes it as a novella and five stories in its starred review , while the publisher calls it a collection of narratives framed by two linked novellas .
Whichever the case , the collection seems likely to investigate the same avenues of grief that have been a hallmark of her prior , powerful work .
( Max )
Bullfighting by Roddy Doyle :
The title story of Doyle ’s collection appeared in the New Yorker in early 2008 and concerns a collection of middle - aged Irish guys blowing off steam on a guys ’ trip to Spain , wives and kids left behind in Dublin .
When I traveled to the Mediterranean later that year and saw many a seaside watering hole advertising the “ Full English Breakfast , ” I thought of this story .
( Max )
Nat Tate : An American Artist : 1928 - 1960 by William Boyd : Boyd , a wonderful author ( Any Human Heart , Brazzaville Beach ) who for whatever reason does n’t seem to get much attention outside of prize committees , made culture vultures everywhere feel like complete assholes in 1998 , when he carefully constructed and published a life of a fictional American artist who died by suicide at age 32 .
Enlisting the help of David Bowie , Gore Vidal , and others , Boyd had a number of people who should have known better reminiscing about Tate and lamenting his early death .
Evidently a lot more people would have looked a lot more stupid had David Lister ( an editor at The Independent who knew about the ruse ) , not revealed the hoax prematurely .
Boyd ’s great literary hoax is to be reissued this April . ( Lydia )
Say Her Name by Francisco Goldman :
A year after the publication of his last novel , The Divine Husband , Francisco Goldman watched his wife of two years , the promising young writer Aura Estrada , die as a result of a freak body - surfing accident .
The aftermath sent him back to journalism for a time .
Now Goldman has trained his considerable novelistic powers directly on the tragedy of his wife ’s death , and on the ineffable continuities among love , grief , and art .
( Garth )
There Is No Year by Blake Butler : Butler , one of the minds behind HTML Giant and author of the indie press favorite Scorch Atlas hits the big time with this new novel .
The Harper Perennial catalog glosses it as evocative of House of Leaves and the films of David Lynch .
A more iconoclastic “ 20 Under 40 ” list might have made room for Butler , and as for Harper ’s labeling 32 - year - ole Butler “ one of the voices of his generation , ” that may say more about how apocalypse - minded we are these days than it does about Butler .

May :
Blue Collar , White Collar , No Collar : Stories of Work edited by Richard Ford :
We ’ve reminisced in the past about the steady disappearance of the short story anthology .
Once common , these pocket - sized wonders now fill shelves at the kind of used bookstore I like to haunt but are rarely seen on the new release table at your local Borders .
Still , a timely theme in these economically stagnant times ( employment or lack thereof ) and the imprimatur of a master of the form , Richard Ford , make this collection worth looking out for .
Sure , most if not all of these stories have been previously published in other books , but how nice to have Stuart Dybek , Edward P. Jones , Charles D’Ambrosio , Ann Beattie , Alice Munro , John Cheever , Richard Yates , Deborah Eisenberg , Jhumpa Lahiri , and several others , all thematically linked and between two covers .

Embassytown by China Mieville Give China Mieville credit for refusing to rest on his laurels .
After scoring a major hit with last year ’s Kraken , his seventh lushly imagined fantasy novel , Mieville will abandon the world of Bas - Lag and his phantasmagorical London and take his fans someplace altogether different and unexpected .
Embassytown , he recently told a Liverpool audience , will contain “ science fiction , aliens and spaceships . ”
The title refers to “ a city of contradictions on the outskirts of the universe ” where humans and the native Hosts live in uneasy peace .
When an unimaginable new arrival hits town , catastrophe looms .
Given Mieville ’s track record , expect a wild ride .
( Bill )
Mondo and Other Stories by J.M.G. Le Clezio :
The 2008 Nobel laureate ’s large body of work continues to make its way into English .
This collection of stories was first published in French in 1978 .
One of the stories collected here , the atmospheric “ The Boy Who Had Never Seen the Sea , ” appeared in the New Yorker shortly after Le Clezio ’s Nobel win .
Like that story , the rest in this collection focus on a child protagonist who seems to see the world through a different set of eyes .

To Do : A Book of Alphabets and Birthdays by Gertrude Stein : Described as “ a fanciful journey through the alphabet ” and originally conceived as a children ’s book , Stein ’s To Do “ spiral[ed ] out of simple childlike progression , so that by the time she reached the letter H , Henriette de Dactyl , a French typewriter ( who exchanges typed messages with Yetta von Blickensdorfer , a German typewriter , and Mr. House , an American typewriter ) wants to live on Melon Street and eat radishes , salads , and fried fish , and soup . ”
Written in 1940 , the book was rejected several times by publishers for being too complex for children .
A text - only version appeared in 1957 ( after Stein ’s death ) from Yale , and in 2011 , the publisher is putting out To Do with Giselle Potter ’s illustrations , realizing Stein ’s original concept .

Paying for
It by Chester Brown : Throughout his twenty - year - long career , Chester Brown has developed a reputation as a wan and fearless confessor , presenting his lapses and failures from a dispassionate remove .
Paying For It — subtitled “ A Comic - Strip Memoir About Being a John ” — may prove to be his most quietly self - lacerating .
In exploring his penchant for prostitutes , Paying For It will likely feature little glamour , little boasting , and an understated honesty .
Drawn and Quarterly predicts that the book “ will be the most talked about graphic novel of 2011 , ” yet Brown does n’t seem to relish controversy .
When asked in 2004 why he might write so openly about his sex life , he responded , “ Because it ’s interesting . ” ( Jacob )
The London Train by Tessa Hadley : Stalwart of the fiction section of The New Yorker , Hadley ’s latest is described as a “ novel in two parts . ”
An early review in the Financial Times calls the book “ darkly elegant ” with “ two distinct halves reflecting , enhancing and informing each other .
The social and geographical territory is familiar for Hadley , that of the bourgeoisie and their travels ( and travails ) as they go looping between London and Cardiff . ” ( Max )
Pulse by Julian Barnes : Barnes ’s latest is his third book of short stories .
A preview from The Spectator explains the collection ’s over - arching theme : “ Each character is attuned to a ‘ pulse ’ – an amalgamation of a life - force and an Aristotelian flaw .
They struggle against or thrive upon the submerged currents of life – touched by ambition , sex , love , health , work and death . ” ( Max )
The Tao of Travel by Paul Theroux : Theroux , the aging , still entertaining rake of the travel writing genre will indulge in a potentially interesting exercise here , collecting “ the best writing on travel from the books that shaped him , ” from Samuel Johnson , Eudora Welty and Mark Twain to Peter Matthiessen , Pico Iyer , and John McPhee .
Cheesy title aside , it certainly sounds like an essential tome for travel writing fans .
( Max )
June :
State of Wonder by Ann Patchett : Ann Patchett has fearlessly ignored the admonition to write what you know .
Her breakout novel , the intoxicating Bel Canto , centered around opera , Japanese business practices and a hostage situation in a South American embassy .
Her new novel , State of Wonder , will have elements that sound similarly abstruse – doctors , medical students , drug development and the Amazon jungle .
But at the heart of the novel is an inspiring student - teacher relationship , which , Patchett told an interviewer , is similar to the bond she had with her own writing teachers , Allan Gurganus and the late Grace Paley .
“ This one was a picnic , ” Patchett says of State of Wonder , “ because I did n’t have to make everything up wholesale . ” ( Bill )
The Astral by Kate Christensen
The question to ask about Christensen ’s next novel is will it deliver up another character on par with Hugo Whittier of The Epicure ’s Lament ?
( “ May we all simmer in the dark with such humor and gusto , ” Sam Lipsyte wrote of Christensen ’s immortal misanthrope . )
The Penn - Faulkner Award - winning Christensen ’s forthcoming sixth novel promises the story of a successful Brooklyn poet , Harry Quirk , whose marriage is in crisis and whose children have been swept up in cultishness of various kinds ( perhaps a sort of Freedom , redux ? ) .
As a writer who reliably turns out novels that elicit warm praise from most of her reviewers , expect ( at least ) a genial , smart , gently satirical tale of the joys and woes of bougie New York life .
( Emily W. )
The Curfew by Jesse Ball :
What to expect from an author who teaches classes on dreaming , false identities , and lying ?
If the author is Jesse Ball , then one should expect expectations to be defied , plot summaries to fall short , and critics to use structures to describe the framework of his imaginative plottings ( nesting - boxes , Klein bottle , labyrinth ) .
Perhaps the magical realms
Ball creates have something to do with his process : “ to conjure up a state of affairs–a glimpse of one situated thought , where the situation is all that surrounds it in the mind . ”
Or with his imaginative approaches to writing , evident in his classes .
Ball ’s novel
The Curfew depicts a father and daughter during wartime , the father risks it all to find his wife and the young daughter imagines her father ’s treacherous journey .
Expect for this description to only loosely conjure the realms of wonder within .
( Anne )
Kurt Vonnegut : Novels & Stories 1963 - 1973 : For those seeking Vonnegut ’s aforementioned best , the Library of America will bestow upon him its black - cover treatment , collecting his great early novels ( Cat ’s Cradle , God Bless You , Mr. Rosewater , Slaughterhouse - Five , Breakfast of Champions ) and stories into one thick volume .
In this setting , it will be especially jarring to read Breakfast of Champions , whose “ World Classics Library ” “ published hard - core pornography in Los Angeles , California . ” ( Jacob )
The Storm at the Door by Stefan Merrill Block : The precocious Block published his first novel at 26 .
The Story of Forgetting , ambitious but flawed , nonetheless suggested Block might be a name to watch .
Sure enough , here he is with a second novel arriving before his 30th birthday .
This time around , Block will again take mental illness as a primary theme .

Lola , California by Edie Meidav : Meidav is a rare thing , a less than well known writer who continues to publish big , dense , challenging novels with a major press .
Meidav ’s third such effort weighs in at 448 pages and asks “ Can an old friend carry in amber the person you were going to become ? ”
Should Meidav be better known ?
Almost definitely .

July :
Once Upon a River by Bonnie Jo Campbell : A 2009 National Book Award nod ( for her collectionAmerican Salvage ) landed Campbell on the radar of many a reader .
Her backcountry fiction focuses on rural characters , meth - cookers , and bad jobs or none at all , all shot through with redemption and compassion .
This new novel , which Campbell says has been in the works for more than four years , sounds like something of a modern - day Huck Finn , following a sixteen - year - old girl who takes to the Stark River in search of her vanished mother .

Estonia : A Ramble Through the Periphery by Alexander Theroux :
In his one - of - a- kind Year in Reading piece , Theroux mentioned being this year “ in the outback of frozen Estonia where I was not only writing a book but , as a kind of project , undertaking a private study of St. Paul and his life . ”
The book in question was this title , forthcoming from Fantagraphics .
The book emerges from Theroux ’s time spent in the former Soviet republic while his wife was on a Fulbright Scholarship .
Ever observant , Theroux uses Estonia and its people as a lens through which to look back at America .
( Max )
The Devil All the Time by Donald Ray Pollock : Former meatpacker and paper mill employee Pollock ’s debut story collection Knockemstiff was a favorite amongst indie booksellers , landed on both Amazon and Publishers Weekly ’s lists of best books of the year , and garnered the following enigmatic praise from the LA Times “ a powerful , remarkable , exceptional book that is very hard to read . ”
According to his blog , Pollock ’s debut novel is set in the 50s and 60s and “ centers on the convergent lives of a tough but morally - upright young man from Ohio , a pair of serial killers who prey on hitchhikers , and an itinerant , spider - handling preacher and his crippled guitar virtuoso accompanist . ”
Naturally .

August :
House of Holes : A Book of Raunch by Nicholson Baker :
There ’s very little info out there on Baker ’s forthcoming novel , aside from some Twitter - excitement , including , “ I do n’t think it ’s about poems ” ( McNally Jackson Bookstore ) and “ Back to Fermata territory ? ” ( Ed Champion ) .
So fans of Baker ’s earlier ( erotic ) novels may be in for a treat .
At Amazon , the description reads : “ a gleefully provocative , off - the - charts sex novel that is unlike anything you ’ve read . ” ( Sonya )
Night Film by Marisha Pessl :
My first impression of Marisha Pessl ’s Special Topics in Calamity Physics was clouded by the many , many stunned reviewers who could not help but mention Pessl ’s beauty , often in the first paragraph of their reviews .
( Indeed , it has been said that her picture was removed from advance copies of the novel to avoid just this . )
Fortunately for those who do not choose books based on the bangability of their authors , while Ms. Pessl is hot , her prose is , by most assessments , hotter .
Whether or not you liked Special Topics , you have to admit that the babe - authoress created one of the most startlingly distinctive fictional voices of recent years in Blue van Meer , the heroine - narrator of Pessl ’s academic novel qua murder mystery ( Oh , the breathtaking allusiveness !
Ah , the witty figurative language — almost exhausting in its inventiveness ! ) .
My fear for Night Film — according to Pessl ’s agent , “ a psychological thriller about obsession , family loyalty and ambition set in raw contemporary Manhattan ” — is that without Blue , Pessl ’s nothing .
Can she–could anyone ( think Jonathan Safran Foer after Everything Is Illuminated ) –generate another voice as distinct and scintillating as Blue’s ?
( Emily W. )
Lights Out in Wonderland by DBC Pierre : After the curious panic surrounding 2003 ’s Vernon God Little ( “ It ’s sort of about Columbine ! ” “ He ’s not even from here ! ” “ It won all kindsa prizes ! ” ) , Australia ’s DBC Pierre faded from American minds .
Three years later , his Ludmilia ’s Broken English failed to gain traction , and it seems a sensible bet that Lights Out In Wonderland — another scattershot soap - box rant — will continue the downward trend .
But as Lights
Out is a foggy howl against the global market ( “ My hair crests over my head like the dying wave of capitalism , ” reads one unfortunate simile ) , Pierre should n’t get too upset if units fail to move .

Anatomy of a Disappearance by Hisham Matar : Hisham Matar , author of In the Country of Men , is the child of Libyan parents .
In 1990 , the novelist ’s father Jaballa Matar was kidnapped in Cairo and extradited to Tripoli as a political dissident .
Since then , his family has endured a special hell of loss and uncertainty–scant news punctuating long periods of silence –which Hisham Matar described in a haunting piece for the Gaurdian last January .
His novel , due in August , is about a missing father , and will presumably draw upon Matar ’s experience as the child of someone disappeared .

Beijing Welcomes
You by Tom Scocca : Slate blogger and former New York Observer Editor Scocca chronicles his years spent in Beijing , observing a city and a culture moving into the global spotlight .
The book examines the Chinese capital on the cusp of its global moment , tracking its history and exploring its singular character .
Since Scocca lived in Beijing in the middle of the last decade , one can assume the buildup to the 2008 Beijing Olympics figures prominently in the text .
Assuming Scocca brings his typical insightful and sometimes scathing perspective ( witness his epic takedown of The New Yorker for publishing Dave Eggers ’s The Wild Things excerpt which ran two years ago at The Awl ) , Beijing Welcomes
You promises to offer astute cultural observation on a culture Americans would do well to observe .

September :
1Q84 by Haruki Murakami : Murakami ’s three volume stemwinder came out in Japan in 2009 and sold out its first printing in a day .
The first two volumes will appear in the US this fall and fervor among English - speaking Murakamians is already building .
The alpha-numeric title is a play on Orwell ’s 1984 – in Japanese the letter Q is a homophonic with the number 9 – and the book ’s plot ( which was a tightly guarded secret prior to its Japanese release ) concerns two characters , a PE teacher and a writer , who become involved in a religious cult through which they create “ a mysterious past , different than the one we know . ” ( Kevin )
The Art of Fielding by Chad Harbach :
In the Winter issue of n+1 , Harbach published a provocative piece suggesting two paths for the novelist : MFA vs. NYC .
Who needs the former , when you can ride the latter to a half - million dollar advance ?
Insiders have , predictably , likened Harbach ’s treatment of a baseball team at a Wisconsin liberal arts college – presumably as a lens through which to view the American scene and the human condition – to the aforementioned Enfield Tennis Academy .

October :
The Forgotten Waltz by Anne Enright : Enright , winner of The Booker Prize for the international bestseller The Gathering , explores a woman ’s affair and her relationship with her lover ’s young daughter .

November :
Parallel Stories by Péter Nadas : Péter Nádas ’
A Book of Memories might just be the best novel published in the ’ 80s , and Imre Goldstein ’s translation into English of its massive successor would , in a just world , be the publishing event of the fall .
Nádas is , simply put , a master .
The freedom with which he combines the diverse idioms of realism , modernism , and postmodernism can only come from decades of discipline .
More importantly – as a recent excerpt in The Paris Review illustrates – he generates a continuous , Proustian intensity of feeling and perception – psychological , philosophical , and physical .
This three - volume work , structured as a set of braided short stories , tracks two families , one Hungarian and one German , across many decades .
Readers looking for a fuller preview might consult Hungarian Literature Online , or Deborah Eisenberg ’s appreciation in The New York Review of Books .

Unknown ( fall and beyond ) :
The Queen of the Night by Alexander Chee : Described by Chee – a Whiting Award and NEA Fellowship recipient , currently a Visiting Professor at the Iowa Writers ’ Workshop — as a kind of “ historical fairy tale , ” Queen is set in the time of the Second Empire ( 1852-70 ) , in Paris .
Chee ’s first novel , Edinburgh , focused on a young boy ’s surviving pedophilia .
“ The Queen of the Night sort of picks up in some ways from where Edinburgh leaves off , ” Chee said in an interview , “ in the sense that it is about a young woman who believes her voice is cursed , and if she uses it , terrible things will happen .
And then she does , and they do .
And she tries to put it right as best she can . ” ( Sonya )
The Map and the Territory by Michel Houellebecq : Michel Houellebecq , the reigning bad boy of French letters , has been accused of every imaginable sin against political correctness .
His new novel , The Map and the Territory , is a send - up of the art world that tones down the sex and booze and violence , but it does feature a “ sickly old tortoise ” named Michel Houellebecq who gets gruesomely murdered .
The book has drawn charges of plagiarism because passages were lifted virtually verbatim from Wikipedia .
“ If people really think that ( this is plagiarism ) , ” Houellebecq sniffed , “ then they have n’t the first notion what literature is . ”
Apparently , he does .
The Map and the Territory has just been awarded the Prix Goncourt , France ’s most prestigious literary prize .

The New Republic by Lionel Shriver : Shriver apparently finished a draft of The New Republic in 1998 .
After six well - regarded but commercially ignored novels , she could n’t find a buyer for this story of “ cults of personality and terrorism ” and was about to give up fiction - writing altogether .
Flash forward a dozen years : Shriver is an Orange Prize winner , a National Book Award finalist , and has sold over a million copies worldwide .
She has been fêted by…er …
The New Republic , and hailed in these pages as “ America ’s Best Writer . ”
Also : terrorism and cults of personality are very much on people ’s minds .
Maybe this will be the book that lands her on the cover of Time .

Hot Pink by Adam Levin : Viewed from afar , Levin ’s first novel , The Instructions , looked , for good and ill – mostly for good – like a kind of apotheosis of the McSweeney ’s house style : playful , inventive , funny - melancholic , youth - focused .
However , it also possessed a couple of attributes that set it apart from other titles on the McSweeney ’s list .
One was its dialectical genius ; another was the ferocity of its anger at the way the world is ( which elsewhere in McSweeneydom often gets sublimated into melancholy ) .
Though Levin wears his influences on his sleeve , his sensibility is utterly distinctive , and almost fully formed .
Look for the stories in the follow - up , Hot Pink , to be formally audacious , occasionally adolescent , but always bracing in their passion .

The Unfolding Haggadah by Jonathan Safran Foer with Nathan Englander :
The only evidence of what this might be comes from Tablet where an essay by Judith Shulevitz includes a note about this title in the author ’s bio .
An anthology it is then .
And with Foer and Englander at the helm , this is one to keep on the radar .

Four Selected Titles with UK publication dates but no US date yet :
Dante in Love by A. N. Wilson : Later this year , English biographer and critic A.N. Wilson comes out with Dante in Love , a study of the Florentine poet that , confusingly , shares a title with a 2005 book about Dante written by Harriet Rubin .
Wilson ’s book will , one imagines , address Dante ’s exile , Beatrice , Guelphs , Ghibellines , and so on ; his perspective as a very public defector from and subsequent re-convert to Christianity might bring new insight to this well - trod territory ( then again , it might not ) .

Mark Zuckerberg had a tough night last night on stage at the D Conference .
Wearing a hoodie and taking heated questions – about privacy and his sometimes - scandalous past – the Facebook CEO and cofounder seemed to melt on stage .
We 're sure it did n't help Zuck that he had a crowd of schadenfreude - fiending industry execs for an audience – most of them hungry to see the kid with the $ 26 billion company squirm .
But Zuck did n't help himself much either : one attendee told us that he did n't answer a single question straight all night , even the softballs .
Did n't keep us from learning a thing or two , though .
Sen. Lindsey Graham ( R - S.C. ) says it may be time to restrict the ability of immigrants to have children who become citizens just because they are born in the country .
Graham eyes ' birthright citizenship '
Sen. Lindsey Graham ( R - S.C. ) announced Wednesday night that he is considering introducing a constitutional amendment that would change existing law to no longer grant citizenship to the children of immigrants born in the United States .
Currently , the 14th Amendment grants citizenship to any child born in the United States .

But with 12 million illegal immigrants living in the U.S. , Graham said it may be time to restrict the ability of immigrants to have children who become citizens just because they are born in the country .
“ I may introduce a constitutional amendment that changes the rules if you have a child here , ” Graham said during an interview with Fox News ’ Greta Van Susteren .
“ Birthright citizenship I think is a mistake ...
We should change our Constitution and say if you come here illegally and you have a child , that child 's automatically not a citizen . ”
Asked how intent Graham is on introducing the amendment , the South Carolina Republican responded : “ I got to . ”
“ People come here to have babies , ” he said .
“ They come here to drop a child .
It 's called " drop and leave . "
To have a child in America , they cross the border , they go to the emergency room , have a child , and that child 's automatically an American citizen .
That should n't be the case .
That attracts people here for all the wrong reasons . ”
Graham insisted that he wants to be “ fair ” and “ humane ” in dealing with the children of immigrants but does n’t want to see an already significant immigration issue become larger .
“ I'm a practical guy , but when you go forward , I do n't want 20 million more 20 years from now , ” he said .
“ I want to be fair .
I want to be humane .
We need immigration policy , but it should be on our terms , not someone else 's .
I do n't know how to fix it all .
But I do know what makes people mad , that 12 million people came here , and there seems to be no system to deal with stopping 20 million 20 years from now . ”
From the Financial Times : FBI to target mortgage fraud
The FBI is preparing to arrest hundreds of people across the US as early as next week for offences including encouraging borrowers to falsify income on mortgage applications , misleading home owners about foreclosure rescue programmes , and inflating home appraisals ...
The FBI is scheduled to release its 2009 mortgage report on June 17 .
excerpt with permission
There is a tradition in the mortgage business of distinguishing between two major types of mortgage fraud , called “ Fraud for Housing ” and “ Fraud for Profit . ”
The former is the borrower - initiated fraud — inflating income or assets , lying about employment , etc. — that is motivated by the borrower ’s desire to get housing ( not the same thing as “ real estate ” ) , by means of getting a loan he or she does n’t actually qualify for .
...
Fraud for profit is simply someone trying to extract cash — not housing — out of the transaction somewhere .
...
The problem with this traditional distinction is that , recently , we seem to have an epidemic of predator meeting predator and forming an alliance : a borrower willing to commit fraud for housing meets up with a seller or lender willing to commit fraud for profit , and the thing gets jacked up to a whole new level of nastiness .
The FBI usually only arrests people engaged in fraud for profit and not fraud for housing - they typically do n't arrest borrowers who misrepresented their income - they arrest mortgage brokers who encouraged people to falsify their income .
Although the distinction was blurred during the bubble ... Tanta wrote a great piece on this in 2007 : Unwinding the Fraud for Bubbles The FBI will probably be busy for years .
Here is another scam in Florida from Sally Kestin at the Sun Sentinel : Squatters take over S. Fla .

Image caption Treating patients at a specialist Harley Street clinic has proved cheaper than a local NHS hospital
When Peter Aylott , 67 , needed a scan for a heart condition he expected it would mean a trip to his local hospital in Kent , not in an exclusive private clinic in London .
But Peter and half a dozen other patients were picked up from their homes in Bexley and taken to the home of private medicine , Harley Street .
" We were transported to and from our doorstep to Harley Street , taken into this salubrious place and really treated as if we were a paying patient . "
With its varnished wooden floors and plush sofas the European Scanning Centre looks more like a boutique hotel than somewhere to scan your heart .
But it is the first in the country to have a CT scanner that can produce a three - dimensional picture of a patient 's heart with a very low radiation dose .
Dr Chris Harvey , consultant radiologist at the European Scanning Centre is proud of the £ 1.5 m machine : " I think this is the way forward , more GP referrals to specialist centres . "
I think this is the way forward , more GP referrals to specialist centres Dr Chris Harvey , Consultant radiologist
The bill for this bespoke service is picked up by Peter Aylott 's local primary care trust in Bexley .
In the past eight months it has sent more than 80 patients to Harley Street for these scans .
The alternative for Peter was yet another invasive angiogram at the NHS hospital in Sidcup , Kent .
" You go in for full surgery , they are putting tubes up your leg - there 's always a risk , I 'd much sooner have the CT scan , no argument . "
Having a CT scan is much safer than an angiogram , where one in every 500 patients suffers a heart attack or stroke .
Commissioning power
The scan is also cheaper , says Dr Kostas Manis , a GP in Bexley .
" The angiogram is £ 1,300 in the NHS , and the private clinic scanner is £ 900 and we 're negotiating to bring the figure down to £ 600 . "
Image caption
The 3D scanner at the European Scanning Centre is the first of its kind in the UK
Dr Manis has helped to develop the new scheme , which has saved the NHS in Bexley £ 300,000 in the past eight months .
Faced with a £ 20 m deficit in 2007 , the primary care trust decided to hand over the bulk of commissioning power to GPs .
They now control 70 % of the £ 150 m budget for Bexley .
Dr Manis was convinced they could improve the service for patients and cut costs .
" The cardiology bill we were receiving from hospitals was astronomical , " he says .
So he helped to introduce a community cardiology scheme .
Every week David Brennand - Roper , emeritus consultant cardiologist at Guys and St Thomas ' hospital , London , sees patients at GP surgeries in Bexley .
Before he arrived 95 % of patients with cardiovascular problems were referred for tests at the local hospital : " The PCT was seeing a lot of money spent at hospital on patients who turned out to be remarkably normal . "
The solution was longer consultations .
Rather than the normal five or 10 minutes , patients see Dr Brennand - Roper for half an hour .
" It does seem to work remarkably well and the referral rates have come down to probably around 10 % . "
Local hospital loses out
That means the GPs get to keep more of the money but the big loser is the local Queen Mary 's hospital in Sidcup .

David Brennand - Roper is aware that schemes like the one in Bexley , which use specialist hospitals and the private sector , could pose problems for small district hospitals .
He says : " If we see patients in the community there will be a problem for hospitals .
The difficulty for the hospital in the long term is the shortfall in income . "
The South London Healthcare Trust , which is responsible for the Queen Mary 's hospital , did not have anyone available to comment .
Dr Kostas Manis says his experience from Bexley is that the introduction of GP commissioning will mean hospitals and consultants have to radically change .
" District hospitals have too many managers and too many consultants .
GPs are in the driving seat and GPs will decide where patients go . "
The revision codifies a 2007 ruling that made attempting to ordain women an offense punishable with excommunication .
The new document said that a priest who tried to ordain a woman could now be defrocked .
For more than two decades , polls have shown that large majorities of American Catholics favor allowing women to be ordained as priests , despite the lack of support for it among church leaders .
The latest poll of American Catholics by The New York Times and CBS News , released in May , showed that 59 percent favored ordaining women , while 33 percent were opposed .
“ I think they see us as their worst nightmare and they ’re doing as much as they can to stop it , ” said Bridget Mary Meehan , one of five American women who say they have been ordained as bishops as part of a tiny movement of women in Europe and the United States who claim to have been ordained as bishops , priests and deacons .
The movement , called Roman Catholic Womenpriests , now claims that 100 women have been given ordination ceremonies as priests , deacons or bishops , and 75 of those are Americans , Ms. Meehan said .
At the news conference here unveiling the changes , Monsignor Scicluna said that rules on their own could not eradicate priestly abuse but that the church now had better tools to work toward that .
“ This gives a signal that we are very , very serious in our commitment to promote safe environments and to offer an adequate response to abuse , ” he said .
“ If more changes are needed , they will be made . ”
In addition to making the faster administrative procedures for disciplining priests the rule , not the exception , the new norms also added possession of child pornography and sexual abuse of mentally disabled adults to the list of grave crimes .
The Vatican also doubled the statute of limitations for abuse cases to 20 years from the victim ’s 18th birthday .
After that , a priest could be removed from the ministry but not defrocked unless the Vatican lifted the statute of limitations in the case , a right it reserves on a case - by - case basis .

From the International Solidarity Movement
Warning : Graphic Photos .
31 May 2010 : An 21 - year old American solidarity activist was shot in the face with a tear gas canister during a demonstration in Qalandiya , today .
Emily Henochowicz is currently in Hadassah Hospital in Jerusalem undergoing surgery to remove her left eye , following the demonstration that was held in protest to Israel ’s murder of at least 10 civilians aboard the Gaza Freedom Flotilla in international waters this morning .
Henochowicz was hit in the face with a tear gas projectile fired directly at her by an Israeli soldier during the demonstration at Qalandiya checkpoint today .
Israeli occupation forces fired volleys of tear gas at unarmed Palestinian and international protesters , causing mass panic amongst the demonstrators and those queuing at the largest checkpoint separating the West Bank and Israel .
“ They clearly saw us , ” said Sören Johanssen , a Swedish ISM volunteer standing with Henochowicz .
“ They clearly saw that we were internationals and it really looked as though they were trying to hit us .
They fired many canisters at us in rapid succession .
One landed on either side of Emily , then the third one hit her in the face . ”
Henochowicz is an art student at the prestigious Cooper Union , located in East Village , Manhattan .
The demonstration was one of many that took place across the West Bank today in outrage over the Israeli military ’s attack on the Gaza freedom flotilla and blatant violation of international law .
Demonstrations also took place in inside Israel , Gaza and Jerusalem , with clashes occuring in East Jerusalem and Palestinian shopkeepers in the occupied Old City closing their businesses for the day in protest .
EVERY weekend , my husband , children and I trundle off to the “ red bakery ”  our unofficial moniker for the Columbia City Bakery , named for its south Seattle neighborhood  and sit down near people in eccentric hats , cyclists , dog walkers and other families with small children who share our scone - and - coffee routine .
It ’s all very neighborly , except that we ’re not actually neighbors .
We live five miles north , and drive past several alternatives along the way .
We ’re drawn to the bakery for its excellent morning treats , but we linger in the sunny space filled with pastry - induced bonhomie .
Perhaps it ’s the slog through the dark winter months that makes Seattle - area residents crave sweets : a little extra sunshine , even if it ’s only from butter and sugar .
No matter the cause , this area has an impressive collection of sweet shops with strong ties to neighborhood residents .
COLUMBIA CITY BAKERY
Columbia City is owned by a serious bread maker , Evan Andres , but his impeccable loaves of pain de campagne and walnut levain share the spotlight with the sweets of his pastry kitchen , which is overseen by Karra Wise .
A narrow but deserved victory for Spain , who simply carried out their gameplan more effectively than their opponents .
There were two issues to be decided with the starting line - ups .
Joachim Loew chose Piotr Trochowski ahead of Toni Kroos to replace Thomas Mueller , whilst Vicente del Bosque finally dropped Fernando Torres , opting for Barcelona ’s wide forward Pedro instead .
And it was Pedro who was the key player in the opening period of the game .
He was constantly involved in play , receiving the ball both in wide areas and centrally , between the lines .
He played a superb through ball to David Villa to create the game ’s first ( and arguably best ) opportunity , but his best work was in his movement and positioning .
He did n’t always stay wide , but he made darting runs in behind opponents to create attacking options , whereas David Silva ( who started the other game Spain played without Torres , against Switzerland ) looks to play a slightly more casual , relaxed passing game .
The other man who had an excellent opening period was Sergio Busquets .
Not the most popular player in the Spain squad , and probably the least naturally gifted midfielder on show today , but he did his job very well , both with and without the ball .
He forced Mesut Oezil to have a quiet game and followed him throughout the pitch .
Oezil started to wander into deep positions , allowing Sami Khedira to make forward runs , but Spain dealt with this well – Busquets continued to close Oezil down regardless of which position he took up , whilst Xavi dropped in and covered .
Busquets ’ positional sense is exemplary , for he manages to constantly take up positions which simultaneously make him available for a pass , and be in place to prevent opponents attacking if the move dies down .
In the first half he attempted 40 passes , and completed 39 – his critics will say that he only ever plays short passes to Xavi and Andres Iniesta , but that is his job .
Besides , it was n’t necessarily true , as the statistics show he frequently played forward balls to Pedro .
Pressing
The best feature of Spain ’s game was their pressing .
Germany played superbly against England and against Argentina , and the quality of those performances should not be forgotten or understated after this defeat , but Loew ’s men found themselves up against an entirely different challenge in midfield today .
England ’s pressing was awful whilst Argentina ’s was n’t properly integrated , but Spain did it amazingly well throughout .
Germany ’s two central midfielders were denied time and space on the ball and were n’t able to play the killer passes they had done so well in this tournament .
Whereas against England they had 3 v 2 in the centre of midfield , today they were down 3 v 4 when Iniesta came inside , and they struggled to work the ball into the final third .
Germany seemed disjointed between the midfield and attack .
Miroslav Klose and Lukas Podolski saw little of the ball in build - up play – and not once in the entire game one complete a pass to the other , which sums up how much Germany struggled in attack .
Mueller was also missed – Trochowski had a decent game , but is simply not the same type of player as Muller , who more naturally linked up with Klose and made direct runs towards goal .
There was less movement and interchanging of positions , and Klose found it difficult against Pique and Puyol .
Passing
Iniesta coming inside to create a numerical advantage for Spain in midfield also worked predictably well when they had the ball .
A key method of getting the ball forward was to bring Iniesta in to create the 4 v 3 , therefore forcing one of the Germany wingers into the centre of the pitch to try to relieve the shortfall .
In turn , this created space for Joan Capdevila and Sergio Ramos , who would storm forward into dangerous positions .
Ramos did this particularly well , and Podolski spent much of the game on defensive duty , rather than running towards Spain ’s goal .
Despite Spain passing well , they were n’t creating a great amount of chances .
Villa had his quietest game of the competition so far , closely marshalled by the two German centre - backs .
They practically doubled up on him , denying him space to turn , for they were n’t too worried about the threat of runs in behind from other players , as Spain generally only got a maximum of three players into dangerous positions .
The full - backs dealt with the other two .
Germany looked happy to accept Spain having the majority of possession , but the German counter - attacks were n’t forthcoming .
Their wide players were in defensive positions , whilst Busquets and Alonso broke up attacks high up the pitch , meaning Gerard Pique and Carles Puyol were rarely threatened by Klose .
This general pattern of play continued after half - time , although the game opened up slightly and there were more shots on goal .
Most of came from Spain – long - range efforts from Pedro and Alonso , and a cross smashed across the six - yard box that David Villa nearly converted .
But the best chance at 0 - 0 fell to Germany , and Kroos .
It was a move reminiscent of Germany ’s final three goals against Argentina – Oezil moved to the left to overload Spain on the flank , he slipped the ball to Podolski , whose cross found Kroos .
His volley was hit into the floor , and was a reasonably easy save for Casillas .
Puyol
For a game featuring a great tactical battle and tremendous , intricate passing moves , the winner was incredibly simple .
Xavi swung the corner in , Carles Puyol ’s run from deep caught out Germany ’s zonal marking system , and he powered a header into the net to give Spain the lead .
And as we ’ve said so often in this tournament , when Spain take the lead , they never look like losing it .
Nor did they look like losing the ball for much of the final 20 minutes – there was little intention to try and score a second ( although Pedro wasted a chance to square to Fernando Torres to confirm the win ) and they closed the game out effectively .
Germany threw on Mario Gomez for Khedira , but never looked like scoring .
Conclusion
In all , a marvellous game of football .
Tense and tight in the first half , with the teams trying to work each other out and passing the ball excellently .
Then a slightly more open second half – with the better side going ahead relatively late on ( but still with enough time for their opponents to get back in the game ) .
They could n’t , and the win was deserved .
Germany ’s midfield has been utterly superb throughout this tournament , but here they simply found themselves against players that were better both in and out of possession .
Xavi was the star man – completing more passes than any other player , running a greater distance than any other player , dictating the game from the centre of midfield , and providing the assist for the goal .
But maybe the most crucial difference was simply quality .
Oezil , Schweinsteiger and Khedira are talented players on the up , but were up against Iniesta , Alonso and Xavi , three of the best midfielders of their generation .
It would be unfair to say Germany ’s trio were outclassed , but they were certainly second best on the day .

Changes ... Collectors hosts Adrian Franklin , Claudia Chan -Shaw and Gordon Brown .
Host Andy Muirhead , adored for his gentle humour and boyish enthusiasm , was charged by the Australian Federal Police for allegedly using the internet to access child pornography .
He has been granted bail to appear in Hobart Magistrates Court on August 2 .
The ABC was quick to act .
Some say too quickly .
Barrister Greg Barns used the ABC 's analytical website , The Drum , to criticise the national broadcaster for immediately pulling the show , taking Muirhead off its Tasmanian local radio breakfast program and removing all trace of him from its content website .
By making Muirhead " swiftly disappear " , Barns wrote , the national broadcaster was denying its employee the presumption of innocence .
The ABC 's head of factual television , Jennifer Collins , who has just returned from the broadcaster 's Hobart studios , where editors have been working around the clock to " rebuild " the show for its relaunch on July 9 , insists the ABC simply obliged Muirhead 's own requests in whisking him off air and internet .
She has not spoken to Muirhead since she received the news .
Andy Muirhead .
" All I can say is that Andy , through his manager , requested that he take personal leave [ without pay ] and , as a result , we accepted that and have moved on to reshape the show , " Collins said .
" As soon as we got that request we had to respond .
We immediately had to start thinking about how we could deliver the series to our audience and that 's what we 've been concentrating on .
The website mirrors the show and the website will go live the week that the show goes back . "
While the ABC 's official statement , released on June 11 , contains the words " pending the outcome of the legal proceedings " , in reference to Muirhead 's suspension , Collins says there is no plan to reinstate him as the show 's host , should he be found not guilty .
" There are a lot of legal issues .
I really can't discuss Andy 's case at the moment .
I 'm not going to speculate on what happens . "
So far , Muirhead has not been replaced .
Rather , the new incarnation of Collectors is a " three - hander " , with existing panellists Gordon Brown , Claudia Chan - Shaw and Adrian Franklin sharing hosting duties .
" It 's very much a team effort and it was our best option , really , " says Collins , who is not ruling out the possibility of a single host in the future .
" I think it 's going to evolve .
At the moment it 's working really well .
Claudia does open the show every week and the boys jump in very quickly , as they do .
The three of them have got so much to offer from their different areas of expertise , so actually , the new format has worked very smoothly for us . "
Any concerns that the success of Collectors , now in its sixth season , hinged on the affability of its host , were put to rest by the onslaught of phone calls and emails the ABC received from viewers desperate for its swift return .
" The message from viewers is really clear , ' We just want to see it back … we want it back on a Friday night at 8 pm , ' " Collins said .
" They are a very loyal audience and we 're very happy with that , so we 've done what we can to turn it around as quickly as possible . "
The cutting and pasting of weeks ' worth of pre-recorded episodes began just days after Muirhead 's departure .
Despite the tight deadline , Collins says no collector 's story was entirely lost .
Production has already begun on post - Muirhead episodes .
The " look and feel " of the show , from the opening credits ( obviously sans the cartoon image of Muirhead ) to the familiar , garishly colourful set , will remain unchanged .

The return episode features a collection of gas masks , some contemporary Chinese art , 18th - century glass and some of the world 's rarest Volkswagens .
" We 've been able to reshape a lot of our stories , " Collins said .
" We 've managed to pull it all together and we 've mixed it up a bit .
We 've had to rebuild the format but the heart of the show is the same .
And for me , the heart of the show is the collectors .
They might have a collection that , initially , I might not be that interested in .
Then they start talking about it and sharing that passion and why they 're compelled to collect , about the thrill of the chase and what it means to them to have the collection , and then all of a sudden I 'm really interested in this collection .
It 's most often the stories behind the objects that draw you in .
That 's what the show is about . "
Collectors returns tomorrow at 8 pm on ABC1 .

This video shows a police officer at the G20 protests in Toronto threatening to arrest a protestor for blowing soap bubbles ( " If one of those bubbles touches me , it 's assault " ) and then leading the protestor away , presumably for the aforementioned " offense . "
If the goal of the police at the G20 was to act pissy and escalate minor incidents into major ones in order to assert their authority , mission accomplished .
If , on the other hand , their mission was to de-escalate , keep the peace , find rapport , and celebrate the democratic right to protest , this officer is an abject , total failure .

National Security , Civil Liberties , and Human Rights Under the Obama Administration
An 18 - Month Review
In the eighteen months since the issuance of those executive orders , the administration ’s record on issues related to civil liberties and national security has been , at best , mixed .
Indeed , on a range of issues including accountability for torture , detention of terrorism suspects , and use of lethal force against civilians , there is a very real danger that the Obama administration will enshrine permanently within the law policies and practices that were widely considered extreme and unlawful during the Bush administration .
There is a real danger , in other words , that the Obama administration will preside over the creation of a " new normal . "
U.S. Vice President Joe Biden on Wednesday defended Israel 's blockade of the Gaza Strip and its decision to intercept the pro-Palestinian flotilla bringing humanitarian aid to the coastal territory , though he did not go so far as to defend the Israel Navy raid that killed nine people two days earlier .
Open gallery view U.S. Vice President Joe Biden Credit : AP
In an interview with Charlie Rose , Biden pointed out that Israel had given pro-Palestinian activists the option of unloading their cargo at the Ashdod port , and offered to bring it to the Gaza Strip on their behalf .
" They 've said , ' Here you go .
You 're in the Mediterranean .
This ship -- if you divert slightly north you can unload it and we 'll get the stuff into Gaza , ' " , he said .
" So what 's the big deal here ?
What 's the big deal of insisting it go straight to Gaza ?
Well , it 's legitimate for Israel to say , ' I do n't know what 's on that ship .
These guys are dropping 3,000 rockets on my people .
" Look , you can argue whether Israel should have dropped people onto that ship or not -- but the truth of the matter is , Israel has a right to know -- they 're at war with Hamas -- has a right to know whether or not arms are being smuggled in . "
During the interview , Biden also blamed Hamas for the crisis that has wracked the coastal territory and for the ongoing state of conflict with Israel .
" As we put pressure , and the world put pressure on Israel to let material go into Gaza to help those people who are suffering , the ordinary Palestinians there , what happened ?
Hamas would confiscate it , put it in a warehouse [ and ] sell it .
" So the problem is this would end tomorrow if Hamas agreed to form a government with the Palestinian Authority on the conditions the international community has set up , " Biden told Rose .
U.S. Congress reacts to Gaza flotilla raid
In contrast to the barrage of condemnations all over the globe , many in the U.S. Congress expressed support for Israel .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi expressed her regret for the loss of life and said the event " underscores the urgent need for negotiations designed to achieve an enduring and comprehensive regional peace . "
House Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer said Israel " rightfully invoked its right to self defense . "
" Hamas could end the blockade at any time by recognizing Israels right to exist , renouncing violence , and releasing Gilad Shalit , " Hoyer continued .
Other members spoke about why there is a need for the blockade of Gaza in the first place .
The blockade exists " to deny Hamas the weaponry and raw materials it needs to continue its rocket attacks in Israel , killing innocent people , " Republican whip Eric Cantor said .

Taking off from JFK today for a two week trip that will take me on a quick stop at Tokyo , then on to Korea , China , and finally Hong Kong .
The zen and artistry of Japanese tattoo has long fascinated me , and with this trip , this post seemed only fitting .
“ Oguri , known in Japan as Horihide , his tattooing name , is a famous artist and highly regarded as the pioneer that brought Japanese tattooing to American tattooists , like Sailor Jerry , and subsequently Ed Hardy , after World War II .
Thus setting the stage for large Asian body suit tattoo design to change the face of western tattooing in the last half of the twenty first century .
Here in his own words is his story ~
“ In old days , Japanese tattooists worked at their own houses and ran business quietly .
They did n’t put up a sign and list telephone numbers on the book .
The practice of tattooing was forbidden in Japan ( until the end of World War II ) .
The customers used to find the tattoo shops by word of mouth .
When I was an apprentice , feudal customs still existed in Japan .
The apprenticeship was one of the feudal customs called uchideshi in Japanese .
Normally , pupils lived with their masters , and were trained for 5 years .
After 5 - year training , the pupils worked independently , and gave the masters money that he earned for one year .
The one - year service was called oreiboko in Japanese , the service to express the gratitude towards the masters .
The masters usually told new pupils about this system , 5 - year - training and 1 - year service , when they began the apprenticeship . ”

“ I slept at the master ’s workplace when I was a pupil .
I wanted to be a great tattoo artist as soon as possible .
In the middle of the night , I picked up the needles from the master ’s tool box , sat cross-legged and practiced tattooing on my thigh without the ink , remembering how my master performed .
I continued to practice tattooing without using the ink .
I used a thick bamboo stick for sujibori ( outlining ) , which was about 20 cm long .
The edge of the stick was sharpened , and 6 - 7 needles were put in order and tied up by silk thread .
The length of the tip of needles was 3 - 4 mm .
I wanted to workas a tattooist soon , and practiced incising both my thighs with the bamboo stick every night after work .
I did not know how to use the tattooing tools and how to adjust the angles .
Sometimes I penetrated the skin very deeply with the needles , and the skin bled and swelled .
I could not tattoo by using the bamboo stick as I wanted .
During the daytime I did chores .
If I had no work during the day , I would sit down on the left side of my master and watch his work from the distance .
Every customer came to the master by appointment and got hitoppori .
Hitoppori in Japanese means to get tattooed for 2 hours each day .
If a big tattoo was to be done , the customer came by every third day .
I used to keep sitting straight for 2 hours and just watching my master ’s hands learn his tattooing skills .
The master would say to me , ‘ I ’m not going to lecture you .
You steal my techniques by watching me work . ’
Watching is the fastest way to learn , rather than listening to the lecture , if people really want to learn something .
Even though I was full of enthusiasm , my skills were not improved easily .
I could n’t see any progress at all . ”

“ One day , the master ’s wife asked me to split wood .
( Pupils normally call the master ’s wife ane - san or okami-san .
The master ’s wife looked so happy when I called her ane - san .
So I called her ane - san during the apprenticeship . )
One day while I was splitting wood in the back yard , I got hotter and hotter .
I was in a sweat , and took off my shirt and trousers .
Ane - san came and asked me to take a rest .
She brought a cup of tea for me .
Then ,
Ane - san happened to see my traces of the needles on the thighs .
She was surprised and said to me , ‘ How did you get scars on the thighs ?
Do you practice tattooing by yourself ? ’
‘ Yes , ’ I answered , ‘ but I can not tattoo well like the master does . ’
‘ Have you ever seen my husband ’s legs and ankles ? ’ she asked again .
‘ No . ’ I said .
She continued , ‘ His whole legs are covered with tattoos .
You know what I mean ?
He told me that he practiced tattooing on his legs with the ink when he was a pupil .
That ’s why his legs are all black .
He also told me that a tattooist needs to learn by tattooing his own body to become a professional tattooist .
There is nothing to replace human skin .
So you have to learn tattooing by using ( tattooing ) your body . ' ”

24 Oct 1955 , Tokyo , Japan ~ Tattoo :
At a gathering of tattoo devotees , this man points out to his son the meanings of the designs , as well as the artistry with which the technique has been executed .
One day , when the youngster grows up , he may choose to have his own body decored in the same way .

“ After hearing this story , I remembered the master had tattoos on his arms to wrists but that I had never seen his bare feet .
I wondered if Ishould practice tattooing with the ink .
Otherwise I could n ’t’t get how the ink was inserted into the skin .
I decided to master the techniques until my whole body would be black .
“ I will never give it up .
If I give it up , I wo n’t be a true man . ”
Since then , I practiced tattooing on any parts of legs from the thighs to the ankles almost every day .
In order to keep practicing again and again , I did n’t’t use the ink when practicing tattooing .
Today ’s young people never understand how tough the training was .
I used to wake up 5 a.m. , and sweep the whole house inside and out .
I also wiped thefloor with a damp cloth .
In winter , my hands were numb with cold water and got chilblains .
My fingers were swollen .
At meals , I was allowed to have only one cup of soup and one dish .
A bowl of rice was also served .
Even though I wanted to eat more , I could not eat enough because I was in training .
It was right after World War 2 .
Due to insufficiency of supplies , it was so hard for us to get enough rice .
We would eat a mixture of rice and barley .
I was only 19 and always starving .
It was tough experience .
Sometimes the master yelled at me and even hit me .
To endure such treatment needs patience .
Because of such unreasonable treatment , most pupils gave up and ran away from the master .
Of course , I often wondered why he hit us .
Although I had anger towards the master , I could not talk back .
All I could do in the feudal period was to obey what the master said .
I was so frustrated that I cried in bed so many times .
The master sometimes slapped me without any reason .
However , I found the master purposely hit me and forced me to do overwork for my mental training after I became a tattooist later on .
I hated him so much during the apprenticeship .
Looking back now , I am ashamed of having had such feelings towards my master . ”

“ When I was an apprentice , my master taught me how to make tattooing needles .
Each tattooist has his own preferred way of making needles .
I put 7 needles in order , and curve the tips of them .
Then I make a fan - shape with them .
The middle of the needles is set as the top of the fan , pulling the rest of them down .
The needles should be arranged like the following figure and soldered up .
When incising thin lines , I use 2 or 3 of 7 needles , which are the closest to the hands , by adjusting the angle of the needles with the skin .
Normally when tattooing the outline , I touch the skin with only the middle of the group of needles .
To tattoo details , some tattooists use a separate tool consisting of only 3 needles .
But the professional tattooists can tattoo whatever they want , using only one set of needles for outlining .
They do n’t have to use other tattooing tools .
They can tattoo any thin or thick lines , small circles and so on .
The professional tattooists tattoo the designs on the skin smoothly , from up to down , down to up , right to left , left to right .
When I need more ink after tattooing from left to right , for example , I do kaeshibari , flipping the needles .
Kaeshibari is one of techniques , which is flipping the other side of the needles and tattooing by using the rest of the ink on the other side . ”

“ Horimono means ‘ tattoo ’ in Japanese .
Hori or horu is ‘ to incise ’ or ‘ to dig ’ and mono means ‘ things . ’
Tattooing is similar to engraving a sculpture .
A tattoo is not a picture .
It is supposed to be appreciated at a distance of several years .
What is expressed by the tattoo should be clearly recognized from a distance .
If the tattoo is too detailed , it can hardly be seen from a distance .
Like sculptures , tattoos need to be rough and drastic to some extent .
Such tattoos are more Attractive to people .
I can see why tattoos need to be bold after the work is finished .
Tattooing by hand , Tebori , requires special techniques .
It should be done by puncturing the skin with the needles gently , adjusting the strength of hands .
Human skin is very soft and elastic .
As the needles leave the skin , I can hear the sound , shakki .
If I tattoo smoothly , I can hear a rhythmical sound like ‘ sha , sha , sha . ’
I dip the needles in the ink , and tattoo a line about one centimeter long .
This same step is done continuously during sujibori ( outlining ) .
I keep the same speed ( rhythm ) to tattoo no matter what kind of designs or shapes , such as circles , squares and lines , are tattooed .
I draw the outlines step by step on each part of the body , such as the shoulders , the arms and the back , and finally finish the art work on the body .
Then the full body tattoo is completed .
For bokashibori ( shading ) , sets of 12 and 13 needles are prepared , and each set is made in the shape of a fan and soldered .
The set of 12 needles is put under the set of 13 needles and staggered by pulling the set of 12 needles back a little bit .
When I do bokashibori , I insert the ink into the skin at an angle which corresponds to the angle made by the two sets of needles .
I have to adjust the strength of the stroke by using both 12 - set needles and 13 - set needles .
If I use either one or the other , the ink cannot be inserted into the skin properly .
The lower 12 - set needles has to be used carefully , like touching the needles on the skin gently .
It ’s very difficult to master how to use those tattoo needles , especially the lower set of needles . ”

“ Today , we Japanese tattooists order tattooing needles from the factory .
However , when I was a pupil , I would make tattooing needles by using the thinnest sewing needles .
Many of them did not have good quality points .
One package had 25 needles , and a half of them were no good .
In those days , we used the ink called sakurazumi .
Now we use baikaboku for tattooing , which is made of soot of cooking oil .
The ink for calligraphy , which is made of soot of resin , is not suitable for tattooing , because the color does not last long .
Those needles were often stolen by customers .
I assume that some other tattooists asked them to pretend to be customers and to steal my tools , in order to know how I made the tattooing needles .
Although I understood that they had eager feelings to learn professional tattooing , I was so angry with the attitudes .
When I was tattooing , I put my tool box beside me .
While I was away ( going to bathroom , for example ) , they stole my needles .
It is not difficult to steal them .
After all , I prepare the necessary needles only when I need them .
I usually lock the door of my studio after work .
Electric machines , color inks , my drawings ( about 120 designs ) for the back have all been stolen at various times .
The tattoo designs were especially important for me .
I had drawn many designs and collected them for a long time .
I am so frustrated whenever I remember those incidents and think how much time I spent on the drawings . ”

“ Tattooists who have not been apprenticed and trained by tattoo masters do not know the reasons or meanings of the traditional designs .
For example , there are four seasons ( spring , summer , fall and winter ) in Japan .
The seasons should be expressed in tattoo art as well .
Real Japanese tattoo artists express each season on the skin .
However , the untrained tattooists do not know traditional thoughts on Japanese art .
The untrained tattooists draw a snake and cherry blossoms , but this is a wrong way in tradition .
When cherry trees begin to bloom in March in Japan , the snake still hibernates under the ground .
So the snake and cherry blossom cannot be seen in the same period .
In other words , it does not make any sense if the snake and cherry blossoms are drawn together .
Some tattooists draw a carp climbing up the waterfall together with peonies .
Actually , we can see the carp climbing up the waterfall from the late September to October in Japan .
It is supposed to go with maple leaves , not peonies .
( The symbol of maple leaves refers to the autumn . )
When hutatsugoi ( twin carp ) and huhugoi ( a married couple carp ) are drawn , two carp ( one carp for the arm , for example ) can go with peonies , because we do not have to express seasons in these cases .
There are several traditional combinations : Karajishi , which is a combination Shishi ( lion ) with botan ( peonies ) , and ryu ( dragon ) with kiku ( chrysanthemum ) and menchirashi ( men means “ a mask , ” and chirashi or chirasu means “ to scatter ” ) with cherry blossoms .
Those images are particular sets for Japanese traditional tattoo designs . ”

“ I am very happy with my job and love it .
As long as I can move my hands , I will keep tattooing .
I thank my master very much .
Without his teachings , I could not have been a tattooist .
I will never forget the gratitude towards the master forever . ”

Army intelligence specialist Bradley Manning was charged yesterday for allegedly leaking video and documents to secret - sharing website Wikileaks .
He faces up to 52 years in prison .
Now , nerds are waging fierce campaigns to discredit both Manning 's informant and Wikileaks itself .
Bradley Manning was arrested last month after his confidant , ex-hacker Adrian Lamo , turned him in .
Lamo won Manning 's trust by portraying himself as a minister and a journalist , and likely traded on a shared queer identity to convince the 22 year - old , deeply troubled soldier to confess his illegal activities over instant message .
Lamo immediately notified Army investigators and spilled the story to his long - time unofficial mouthpiece , Wired 's Kevin Poulsen .
Blogs and messageboards have filled with Anti-Lamo chatter .
Lamo and company are waging war against Wikileaks .
It 's a classic nerd fight played out via the Wikileaks - approved tactics of leaks and counter - leaks , as both sides bring secrets to light in the hopes of discrediting the other .
So , how 's the fight shaping up ?
On one hand , there 's :
Team Lamo
Team Lamo believe Manning 's alleged leaks justify Adrian Lamo 's betrayal .
Lamo is the " Hacker Hero " who 's conscience propelled him to turn in one of his own .
( We are not on Team Lamo . )
The most vocal member of Team Lamo is Adrian Lamo .
Lamo has a long history of seeking attention , fueled in part by a symbiotic relationship with Wired editor Kevin Poulsen to whom he feeds tips about his exploits in exchange for favorable coverage .
He 's a one - person PR shop with a cringe - worthy formspring .
me page , Twitter account and a barrage of formal press releases with titles like " Despite Death Threats , Adrian Lamo Maintains Resolve to Testify in Wikileaks / Bradley Manning Case . "
The New York Times
Times took notice of Lamo's PR output recently , and wrote an article about how he wo n't stop talking .
In his most brazen attempt to discredit Wikileaks , Lamo gave an interview claiming that Wikileaks had betrayed him as a source .
He says that he leaked an uncensored transcript of his own IM chat with Bradley Manning to Wikileaks to see if they would leak it .
The transcript mysteriously turned up on BoingBoing a few days later .
Recently , Lamo wrote a long refutation of a Salon article by Glenn Greenwald that was critical of him .
After Greenwald refused to publish Lamo 's spiel , he posted it to secret - sharing website cryptome.org , Wikileaks ' main competitor .
Cryptome.org , whose founder has been highly critical of Wikileaks in the past , is Team Lamo 's other major player .
In addition to posting Lamo 's denials and clarifications , Cryptome has leaked eight messages from a person known only as " Wikileaks Insider " .
These purport to offer inside knowledge of a division in Wikileaks ' ranks , constant money problems and the " absolute dictatorship " of Wikileaks editor Julian Assange .
Wikileaks says these messages are part of a fabricated " smear campaign . "
Then there 's...
Team Wikileaks
( We are not on Team Wikileaks , either )
Wikileaks ' and its conspiracy - minded editor Julian Assange are spearheading their own campaign against Lamo , in apparent revenge for his betrayal of one of their key sources .
On Twitter , they 've hinted that Poulsen and Lamo were colluding with the US government , and pointed out " disturbing " articles and interviews .
And it appears Wikileaks had a hand in leaking a log of an instant message chat between Lamo 's wife and a former friend , Nadim Kobeissi .
These chats suggest that Wired 's Kevin Poulsen whitewashed a recent profile of Lamo to hide a prescription drug problem .
Kobeissi says these chats " provide evidence that shows that [ Lamo ] and Poulsen are both very unreliable sources . "
( Kobeissi told us in a phone interview that the logs were real , and Lamo has not contested this . )
At least two websites have been set up specifically to cast doubt on Lamo 's character and history .
When Adrian Lamo put out a press release claiming he had employed " award winning journalist Andy Stangby " to fact - check Glenn Greenwald 's critical Salon article , one of these blogs published a funny Facebook wall exchange that suggests Lamo had embellished his fact - checker 's credentials .
( Lamo soon deleted the press release and the wall post )
And here is the inevitable Stop Snitching Nerds website and T - shirt .
In the battle over Wikileaks , as with Wikileaks itself , leaks are n't pure data .
They 're pointed arguments .
And while Wikileaks ' and its rhetoric of radical transparency is new , this tactic is as old as journalism .
It 's called digging up dirt .
Its tablet computer can't play most of the videos on the Web ... its cell phone has trouble making voice calls ... and yet its products are wildly popular , selling millions worldwide and engendering a cultish devotion among followers .
Apple is the new religion , say several academics .
It 's not a matter of rationality , it 's a matter of faith .
In a research paper published this month by two professors at Texas A&M University , the authors argue that the only way to understand the slavish adoration and over - the top financial success of Apple and its " Jesus Phone " ( the iPhone ) is to understand its minimalist , white - walled stores as the new churches of the tech generation .
" The religious - like behavior and language surrounding Apple devotion / fandom is an example of ' implicit religion , ' " Prof.
Heidi Campbell , one of the authors of the study , told FoxNews.com .
Implicit religion can happen when the use of , say , technology becomes a substitute for belief and behaviors once attached to religion and religious practice , she said .
That , according to the authors , explains why fans still believe when the leader of the Church of Apple , Steve Jobs , blames consumers for the poor reception of the company 's cell phone ( clearly , users are holding their phones incorrectly ) .
In fact , they flock to buy the device despite its serious design flaws .
More On This ... Jailbreak !
New Rules Allow Unapproved iPhone Apps
Even the pope has fretted about this new religion .
In his 2006 Christmas address , Pope Benedict XVI rhetorically asked if a savior was still needed in the modern wired world .
The response from prominent technology blog Gizmodo : " Hopefully , our shepherd , Steve Jobs , will unveil Apple - Cellphone - Thingy , the true Jesus Phone ...
It shall lift the hunger and disease you speak of from the land ... "
The post was meant to be tongue - in - cheek , but it also revealed the rapture with which many Apple fans follow the company and its products .
University researchers note that Apple 's history has elements that reflect basic elements of more traditional religions :
-- Apple 's creation story epitomizes the humble garage origin of its technology -- not unlike the humble manger of Jesus ' birth .
-- Apple CEO
Steve Jobs is perceived as a messianic leader who was fired but rose again to save the company .
-- Apple has traditionally had an evil archenemy , the Devil , as represented first by Microsoft and now by Google .
So if they wanted to , could Apple devotees actually create an official Apple religion ?
After all , many believe in the power of the iPhone and millions of consumers would buy any product the company introduces , flaws and all .
There does n't seem to be an associated belief in a supernatural power connected to Apple , but that does n't matter :
To establish a religion , such a belief is not necessary -- at least , legally speaking in the U.S .
The Church of the SubGenius enjoys religious status in the U.S. under the First Amendment , for example .
Its 10,000 reported followers believe primarily in the power of " slack , " the sense of freedom that comes by achieving personal goals .
Indeed , it would be interesting if Apple were to apply for such a status in the future .
Just think of the tax implications .

James Bond 007 : GoldenEye for Wii
I remember the day this game came out .
It was in the fall of 1997 , and I was still in high school .
I remember seeing the relatively unimpressive ads .
The game was pushed as a major title for the holiday season , but it was n’t like it was a new Super Mario Brothers or anything like that .
I bought it thinking it might be fun to play for a little while .
I think I speak for everyone when I say nobody could have expected Goldeneye would become such an instant classic .
Before Goldeneye was released , I had decent grades .
Within a matter of weeks , I was spending four to five hours straight playing “ The Man With The Golden Gun ” against my brother and his friends in The Facility .
We simply could n’t get enough of Goldeneye ’s incredibly fun multiplayer mode .
What if I told you Goldeneye is coming back for the Wii ?
No , I ’m not talking about Perfect Dark , Tomorrow Never Dies , or any of the other failed successors to the crown .
I ’m talking about the classic we all remember like it was an irreplaceable part of being a kid .
I ’m talking about the game that changed everything !
Wii Goldeneye is a modern remake of the game we all remember .
It follows along a similar story line , incorporates many of the same multiplayer gameplay elements , and it even features the same characters .
Get ready to pick up your PP9 and stealthily sneak past guards while intercepting messages from Mi6 .
Bond is back , and he ’s better than ever .
A Modern Upgrade Of A Classic
It goes without saying that after 13 years , the new Goldeneye will have significantly better graphics and a much more realistic feel .
But here ’s what you probably did n’t expect .
James
Bond is now played by Daniel Craig , and many of the levels in the game are completely different from the original N64 title .
From what we have seen of the new Goldeneye demos , the game is only loosely based on the N64 title .
The first level is similar to the runway level from the first game , but only in terms of overall style .
As you play through it , you realize pretty quickly that players will be in for a whole new experience .
The Element Of Surprise
The old Goldeneye was one of the first shooters to allow you to sneak past guards .
The new Wii Goldeneye incorporates stealth , but in a whole new way .
The guards are on a much more heightened alert than they were in the N64 title .
Just one misfired shot , and the game switches from stealth mode to combat mode .
Bond ’s health bars are replaced with a screen that gets bloodier as you take more damage .
As soon as you kill everyone in the room before they can muster a distress call , you go back to stealth mode .
The game progresses in this way , keeping you alert and always looking for ways to stay undercover .
It is entirely possible to play through all of the levels without alerting the guards .
Just like the classic Goldeneye , players will enjoy turning the missions into puzzles and getting through them without taking a single hit .
Would You Pay $ 70 For A Controller ?
We were stoked when we found out you can use a variety of controllers with the new Goldeneye for Wii .
Not only can you use a Wiimote and nunchuck , you can play this game with the Wii classic controller and Wii classic pro controllers .
This is going to be hit with players who want a more N64 - based gameplay style .
You can almost smell the nostalgia in the air .

There are also rumors of a Klobb - like attachment for the nunchuk as well as a gold - plated Wii classic pro controller , both available for pre-order on Gamestop ’s website .
Guess what the list price is … $ 70 !
Certainly we are all for cool , themed Wii accessories , but wow .
Maybe they ’re assuming the Goldeneye generation has grown up and gotten real jobs ( along with a taste for expensive controllers ) .
That , or the controller comes with the game .
We do n’t know for sure yet , but we certainly hope it ’s the latter because that ’s a huge amount of money to pay for a simple peripheral .

Multiplayer , The Most Important Part Of The Game
Everyone remembers the glory that was Goldeneye ’s multiplayer mode .
It was so addictive that you could spend days upon days playing the game with your friends , annoying them with proximity mines and sneaky tactics .
While the multiplayer mode for the new Goldeneye will never replicate the feeling of toasting Natalya with a rocket launcher , it will do more than enough to keep players coming back for more .
From what we ’ve seen , Activision and Eurocom are fully intent on bringing back the experience of fighting in close quarters with your friends .
The multiplayer mode felt very similar to the classic Goldeneye .
The levels were simple and memorable , one element that made Goldeneye for N64 such a standout .
When your friend who just began playing the game can actually remember where he is on any level , he instantly starts coming up with strategies that are just as clever as yours .
Many of the old Goldeneye ’s characters are back in multiplayer mode .
You can play as Oddjob , Jaws , Scaramonga , and many other memorable names .
While there is no official word on which weapons or modes will be available in multiplayer , the demo looks pretty promising .
Goldeneye for Nintendo 64 changed the way we approach the first person shooter genre .
The new Goldeneye might not be as revolutionary , but it ’s certainly going to be a great shooter title for the Wii when it arrives this holiday season .
Get ready to invite some friends over for hours of split screen mayhem .
Save a few couch seats , because it ’s going to be a long night !
Final Fantasy publisher / developer Square Enix has never officially announced that it would be bringing its online game Final Fantasy XIV to the Xbox 360 , but they have been public about their desire to bring the MMO to Microsoft 's system .
Now they 're being open about why they can't do it .
At E3 2009 , Sony made a splash when it announced at its press conference that it had the console exclusive on MMO Final Fantasy XIV .
Just hours after that , however , Square Enix officials were pointing out that despite the de facto
Sony console exclusive ( the game 's also coming to PC ) , that Square Enix wanted to bring the game to the Xbox 360 .
Now Square 's Hiromichi Tanaka says that Final Fantasy XIV wo n't be coming to the Xbox 360 because of Microsoft 's strict Xbox Live policy , which keeps the system closed to things like MMOs .
He says that Microsoft made a " one- time " exception for Final Fantasy XI , but since then has been unwilling to budge .
We 've heard from many developers over the years that concurred that Microsoft 's controlled approach to Xbox Live makes things like MMOs practically impossible to do from a publisher 's standpoint .

Phoenix , Arizona ( CNN ) -- Jairo Tellez 's seafood distribution business is a family affair .
In the industrial warehouse that houses J and V Mariscos on the west side of Phoenix , his wife , Vicki , and four of his seven children load trucks , take phone calls , enter data and help care for his infant grandson , who has a playpen in Tellez 's office .
But with portions of Arizona 's controversial immigration enforcement law set to take effect Thursday , the business is in limbo .
" If people are not eating , we 're not selling , " said Wendy Cisneros , a family friend who works in the back office .
" We 've lost 60 percent of sales , and right now the future 's uncertain .
We do n't know if we 're going to stay in the state ; we do n't know if we 're going to close the business .
Everything 's up in the air . "
Most of their clients cater to the Latino community , which has effectively gone into hiding amid concerns that they may have to leave the state as soon as the bill becomes law , Cisneros said .
A key part of Arizona 's immigration law was temporarily blocked by a judge Wednesday .
This means police wo n't be required to ask people about their immigration status .
Toobin : What does Arizona immigration ruling mean ?
But for the Tellez family business and others like it , the damage from the controversy already is done .
Reduced spending in restaurants , grocery and retail stores has triggered a domino effect among businesses in the metro Phoenix business community and throughout Arizona .
To stay afloat even as their clients disappear or reduce inventory orders , the business has reduced employees ' hours and cut back operations in the industrial warehouse , home to several large freezers and forklifts and an office sparsely decorated with posters of illustrated fish and cuts of meat .
Perhaps the toughest decision was to halt lines of credit to customers , even those with good history , she said .
" We can't really offer credit anymore because we do n't know if next week they 're going to close the business , " Cisneros said .
" But it 's also a downside because some customers need that credit to operate . "
Firm numbers illuminating the economic fallout of SB 1070 are hard to come by as the bill has yet to take effect .
Also , summer tends to be slow for business and tourism in Arizona because it 's so hot .
But anecdotal evidence from business owners , real estate agents and community leaders indicates the mere specter of the bill has created a culture of fear among Hispanics in Arizona that 's slowly paralyzing sectors of the economy .
Hispanics make up 30 percent of the state 's population .
The state 's unemployment rate in June rose for the third month in a row , to 9.7 percent .
Gov. Jan Brewer signed the bill in April .
Traditionally , community groups look to indicators such as the housing market , school enrollment and data from utility companies to track economic fluctuations within a certain group , said Edmundo Hidalgo , president and CEO of Chicanos Por La Causa , a community outreach program in Phoenix .
Based on feedback from clients and preliminary data , Hidalgo said his group estimates that rental vacancies in predominantly Latino neighborhoods will be 10 to 15 percent higher than the normal rate of 12 percent .
" People are scared , and they do n't want to wait around to find out what 's going to happen with SB 1070 , " said Hidalgo , whose group offers housing , economic and education services to low - income families and individuals , both undocumented and U.S. - born .
" Regardless of their status , people are frustrated with an environment that 's not accepting and potentially threatening , and they 're fed up with being targeted and singled out by law enforcement .
It 's driving them out of the state , and not necessarily to better situations . "
Reactions to the Arizona immigration law injunction
The Arizona housing market , which was already suffering from one of the highest foreclosure rates in the country , has also taken an extra hit since the passage of the law , according to real estate agents who spoke with CNN .
Some homeowners who purchased property in the past year are looking to unload , according to Saul Pua , a real estate agent who sells residential properties in neighborhoods in Phoenix 's Latino communities .
" Most families usually have one person who does n't have papers , and they do n't want to risk being arrested and splitting up the family by staying in Arizona , " said Pua , who is married to one of the daughters of Tellez , the owner of J and V Mariscos .
Even during the recession , Pua said business was good because property was cheap , and that in better times , he closed an average of five transactions a month .
Since the beginning of the year , however , he has been lucky to sell two properties in a month , and in July , he has n't closed a single deal .
" I had investors buying properties , but now's who gonna rent them ? " he said .
Commercial real estate developer Michael Pollack was in the same situation leading up to Wednesday 's ruling .
Since April , clients in predominantly Latino neighborhoods across the state had been pulling out of properties or calling to relay concerns over whether they should stay if the law goes into effect .
Today , Pollack said he received several calls from clients expressing relief and letting him know they intended to stay .
" The ruling today has definitely been a move in the right direction for commercial tenants and their customers , who 've been scared that Arizona was n't going be friendly to Hispanic community , " he said .
" This gives the federal government to get to work implementing an immigration policy that the American people will support unanimously and deals with the situation at the border , which is where the real problem is . "
Phoenix 's sprawling concrete landscape bears testimony to the abundance of vacant residential and commercial property .
" For sale " signs in English and Spanish adorn brown , sun-scorched lawns and dilapidated parking lots alike , from the heart of downtown Phoenix to as far as Chandler and Mesa -- the district of SB 1070 's sponsor , Republican Sen. Russell Pearce .
Boarded - up big - box stores loom large in their vast emptiness , and rows of abandoned strip mall storefronts outnumber those that are occupied in some parts .
Not only businesses targeting the Latino community are suffering .
Economic boycotts adopted by other states and cities have hit Arizona 's meeting and convention business .
Since groups nationwide began announcing boycotts of the state because of SB 1070 , at least 40 meetings have been canceled .
That 's resulted in the loss of $ 12 million in lodging alone , according to Kristen Jarnagin , spokeswoman for the Arizona Hotel & Lodging Association .
Summer is typically the low season , she noted , and pointed out that tourism was up 8 percent statewide in June 2010 compared with June 2009 , which was one of the " worst summers ever " because of the recession .
Despite that slight uptick , more telling is the lack of inquiries for future bookings , she said .
" What we 're hearing from meeting planners now is they wo n't and can't consider Arizona for 2011 , 2012 meetings not necessarily because of their own stance on SB 1070 or the boycott but just because they want to avoid the controversy and do n't want to risk losing attendance , " she said .
The absence of meetings and conventions not only affects the hotel industry and its 200,000 employees , but also ancillary businesses such as restaurants , retailers and taxis , Jarnagin said .
It seems that not even fast - food joints are immune to the encroaching economic fallout of SB 1070 .
As the four Tellez children stood with their parents in their office Wednesday , recounting tales of friends and relatives who have left town or seen families torn apart , daughter Nikki noted her surprise at seeing a shuttered Burger King .
" I was driving down Camelback with my dad and Burger King was closed , and I was like , when have you seen that ?
Like Burger King -- everybody goes to Burger King , and that was closed down . "

British eccentric and politician
For other uses , see Mytton
John " Mad Jack " Mytton ( 30 September 1796 – 29 March 1834 ) was a British eccentric and rake of the Regency period who was briefly a Tory Member of Parliament .
Early life [ edit ]
John Mytton was born on 30 September 1796 , the son of John Mytton and Sarah Harriet .
[1 ]
His family were Shropshire squires with a lineage that stretched back some 500 years . [ a ]
His father died at the age of 30 , when Jack was two years old , and he inherited the family seat of Halston Hall , Whittington , near Oswestry , which was worth £ 60,000 ( £ 4.3 million as of 2006 ) , [ 2 ] as well as an annual income of £ 10,000 ( more than £ 716,000 as of 2006 ) from rental and agricultural assets generated by estates of more than 132,000 acres ( 53,000 ha ) at Dinas Mawddwy and in Shropshire .
Mytton was sent to Westminster School , but was expelled after one year for fighting a master .
He was then sent to Harrow School , from which he was also expelled after three terms .
He was then educated by a disparate series of private tutors whom he tormented with practical jokes that included leaving a horse in one tutor 's bedroom .
Despite having achieved very little academically , Mytton was granted entry to Trinity College , Cambridge .
He matriculated in January 1816 but , according to Alumni Cantabrigienses , it is doubtful that he took up his place , [ 3 ] although there are claims that he took 2,000 bottles of port to sustain himself during his studies .
He certainly was not awarded a degree , [ 3 ] having found university life boring , and embarked on a Grand Tour .
Military service [ edit ]
Mytton saw both part - time and full - time military service .
In 1812 , when he was 16 , he was commissioned as captain in a local yeomanry regiment , the Oswestry Rangers . [ 4 ]
In 1814 it was merged into the North Shropshire Yeomanry Cavalry , into which Mytton transferred . [ 5 ]
After Mytton 's return from the Grand Tour , he was commissioned in the regular Army and joined the 7th Hussars .
As a cornet , he spent a year with the regiment in France as part of the army of occupation after the defeat of Napoleon I , spending his time gambling and drinking before resigning his commission .
He rejoined the North Shropshire Yeomanry after his subsequent return to England and was promoted to major in 1822 .
He had attempted in vain to lobby its colonel for an even higher rank in the place of an uncle , William Owen , who had left the regiment . [ 6 ]
Despite his later periods abroad and imprisonment , he was still on the regimental strength at the time of his death twelve years later . [ 7 ]
Life as a squire [ edit ]
John Mytton , c. 1820 – 1830
Mytton later returned to his country seat and took up the duties of a squire in preparation for coming into his full inheritance when he became 21 .
In 1819 he entertained ambitions of standing for Parliament , as a Tory , [ 8 ] following family tradition .
He secured his seat by offering voters £ 10 notes , spending a total of £ 10,000 ( more than £ 750,000 as of 2006 ) [ 2 ] ) .
He thus became MP for Shrewsbury .
He spent just 30 minutes in the House of Commons in June 1819 , but found the debates boring and difficult to follow because of his incipient deafness . [ 9 ]
When Parliament was dissolved in 1820 he declined to stand at the next election .
[ 8 ]
He instead served as High Sheriff of Merionethshire for 1821 – 22 , High Sheriff of Shropshire for 1823 – 24 , and Mayor of Oswestry for 1824 – 25 . [ 9 ]
He served as treasurer of the Salop Infirmary at Shrewsbury in 1822 . [ 10 ]
However , he attempted to enter Parliament again in 1831 , this time for one of the two Shropshire seats and as a Whig candidate .
He withdrew on the fifth day of the poll and came bottom with 376 votes .
He then issued an address stating that he would contest the next parliamentary election , but by the time of that election , in 1832 , he had gone into exile to escape his creditors . [ 11 ]
Meanwhile , he indulged his enjoyment of horseracing and gambling , and enjoyed some success at both .
He bought a horse named Euphrates , which was already a consistent winner , and entered it in the Gold Cup at Lichfield in 1825 , and it duly won .
Its portrait , commissioned by Mytton from the painter William Webb , was exhibited at the Royal Academy the same year .
Mytton also became a well - known character at Oswestry Race Course , an increasingly disreputable local racetrack . [ 12 ]
It is said that in 1826 , in order to win a bet , he rode a horse into the Bedford Hotel opposite the Town Hall in Leamington Spa , up the grand staircase and onto the balcony , from which he jumped , still seated on his horse , over the diners in the restaurant below , and out through the window onto the Parade .
He also held contests for local children at Dinas Mawddwy , giving sums ranging from half a crown to half a guinea to those who rolled all the way down the hill Moel Dinas . [ 13 ]
Field sports [ edit ]

Mytton riding his bear , by Henry Alken , 1837
Mytton had hunted foxes with his own pack of hounds from the age of ten and went hunting in any kind of weather .
His usual winter gear was a light jacket , thin shoes , linen trousers and silk stockings , but in the thrill of the chase he sometimes stripped off and continued the hunt naked , even through snow drifts and rivers in full spate .
He also continued hunting despite being unseated and sustaining broken ribs -" unmurmuring when every jar was an agony " , and sometimes led his stable boys on rat hunts , each stable boy being equipped with ice skates .
He had a wardrobe consisting of 150 pairs of hunting breeches , 700 pairs of handmade hunting boots , 1,000 hats and some 3,000 shirts .
Mytton kept numerous pets , including some 2,000 dogs .
His favourites among them were fed on steak and champagne .
His favourite horse , Baronet , had free range inside Halston Hall and lay in front of the fire with Mytton .
It was said of " Mad Jack " that " not only did he not mind accidents , he positively liked them " .
Mytton drove his gig at high speed and once decided to discover if a horse pulling a carriage could jump over a tollgate ( it could not ) .
On another occasion he asked his passenger whether he had ever been upset in a gig .
The man said he had not and Mytton responded , " What !!
What a damn slow fellow you must have been all your life ! "
He promptly drove the gig up a sloping bank at full speed , tipping himself and his passenger out .
Decline and death [ edit ]
D--n this hiccup , by Henry Alken , 1837 , by Henry Alken , 1837
Mytton was an extravagant spendthrift .
Visitors to his estates sometimes found banknotes secreted around the grounds , whether left on purpose or simply lost .
Over the course of fifteen years he managed to spend his inheritance and then fell into deep debt .
His agent had calculated that if he could but reduce his expenditure to £ 6,000 a year for six years his estate would not have to be sold , but Mytton declared that " I would n't give a damn to live on £ 6,000 a year ! "
In 1831 he sold his estate at Dinas Mawddwy to John Bird , [ 14 ] and fled to Calais to avoid his creditors .
He had met an attractive 20 - year - old woman named Susan on Westminster Bridge and offered her £ 500 a year to be his companion .
She accompanied him to France and stayed with him until his death .
During his stay in Calais he tried to cure his hiccups by setting his shirt on fire .
Charles James Apperley , who wrote under the pseudonym of " Nimrod " , was present at this event : " ' Damn this hiccup !! ' said Mytton as he stood undressed on the floor , apparently in the act of getting into bed ' but I ’ll frighten it away ' ; so seizing a lighted candle applied it to the tail of his shirt – it being a cotton one – he was instantly enveloped in flames .
A fellow guest and Mytton ’s servant beat out the flames : ' The hiccup is gone , by God ! ' , said he and reeled , naked , into bed . "
In 1833 , Mytton returned to England , where , still unable to pay his debts , he ended up in the King 's Bench Prison in Southwark .
He died there in 1834 , a " round - shouldered , tottering , old - young man bloated by drink , worn out by too much foolishness , too much wretchedness and too much brandy " .
The cause of death was delirium tremens .
[ 3 ]
He was buried in the vault of the private chapel at Halston on 9 April . [ 1 ]
A print of a portrait of John Mytton by Rudolph Ackermann was published in 1847 , 13 years after their deaths .
These were marked " JOHN MYTTON ESQ .
HALSTON SALOP ~ from an original picture in the possession of John Bishton Minor Esq. Astley House Pradoe , guardian of J. F. G. Mytton , this engraving of his ward 's late father "
When the print was published John jnr would have been 24 years old and would have inherited what was left of the estate .
There is also a portrait of Mytton on horseback , by William Webb , and numerous illustrations , by Henry Thomas Alken and T. J. Rawlins , appear in Nimrod 's Life of John Mytton .
Personal life [ edit ]
In 1818 , he married for the first time to Harriet Emma Jones , a daughter of Sir Thomas Tyrwhitt Jones , in London , but she died in Cliffden , Somerset , on 2 July 1820 .
His second marriage was to Caroline Mallet Giffard from Chillington Hall in October 1821 at Brewood , Staffordshire .
[ 1 ]
She ran away in 1830 and lived the rest of his life estranged .
Mytton left a number of children .
Harriet Emma Charlotte was born on 23 April 1819 to his first wife .
[ 1 ]
His second wife , Caroline , had a daughter and four sons : Barbara Augusta ( b. 9 August 1822 ) , John Fox Fitz - Giffard ( b. 20 November 1823 ) , Charles Orville January ( 9 January 1825 ) , Euphrates Henry ( b. 10 April 1826 ) and William Harper ( b. 30 April 1827 ) .
Euphrates and Charles both died within months after their father and were also buried at Halston , as was Caroline upon her death in 1841 .
[1 ]
His two other sons and both daughters survived him .
Barbara Augusta in 1847 married Colonel Poulett George Henry Somerset , son of Lord Charles Henry Somerset , a younger brother of the 6th Duke of Beaufort .

There 's little doubt that , at least early in its history , Mars had significant quantities of liquid water .
Everything from mineral deposits to ancient shorelines and river - like features indicate that the watery period peaked near the border between the planet 's Noachian and Hesperian epochs , about 3.5 billion years ago .
There has been some debate , however , about just how much water was present at that time .
A paper published over the weekend in Nature Geoscience argues that there was enough to cover the planet 's northern pole in an ocean .
The logic of the analysis is pretty simple , and applies the sort of reasoning we use for determining the Earth 's historic ocean levels .
In short , you look for geologic features indicative of a shoreline , and see if they line up at the same altitude .
In this case , the two authors used a database that tracks the appearance of river deltas on the Martian surface , and uses the Mars Observer Laser Altimeter dataset to get elevations for each of them .
If an ancient ocean existed , these features should exist within a narrow range .
On a first pass , the data did n't look very promising , as the mean elevation of the 52 deltaic deposits under consideration varied widely ( the standard deviation was over a kilometer ) .
But the authors went through and analyzed each deposit individually , and found that many were associated with a local basin , such as a large crater .
Only a third of the features were associated with the outflow of water into the basin that covers the northern hemisphere of the planet , and these were tightly clustered in elevation ( a mean elevation of of - 2,540 m with a standard deviation of 177 m ) .
The authors point out that this is exactly what you 'd see if you were looking at an ancient shoreline , writing , " Therefore , the deposits topographically connected to the site occupied by the putative ocean define the closest approximation of an equipotential surface as would be expected if they formed in a single large body of standing water encompassing the northern hemisphere of Mars . "
Data from outside the region suggests that there might have been a planet - wide water table in the crust , as there are almost no valleys below the shoreline level that date from the Noachian , even in areas well removed from the northern basin .
That changes in more recent eras , suggesting a gradual loss of water planet - wide .
Cumulatively , there seems to have been a lot of water involved — the authors estimate that over 108 cubic kilometers may have been present , with 36 percent of the planet 's surface covered in water .

The most interesting part of my job is that I get to observe powerful people at close quarters .
Most people in government , I find , are there because they sincerely want to do good .
But they ’re also exhausted and frustrated much of the time .
And at these moments they ca n’t help letting you know that things would be much better if only there were n’t so many morons all around .
So every few weeks I find myself on the receiving end of little burst of off - the - record trash talk .
Senators privately moan about other senators .
Administration officials gripe about other administration officials .
People in the White House complain about the idiots in Congress , and the idiots in Congress complain about the idiots in the White House  especially if they ’re in the same party .
Washington floats on a river of aspersion .
The system is basically set up to maximize kvetching .
Government is filled with superconfident , highly competitive people who are grouped into small bands .
These bands usually have one queen bee at the center  a president , senator , cabinet secretary or general  and a squad of advisers all around .
These bands are perpetually jostling , elbowing and shoving each other to get control over policy .
Amid all this friction , the members of each band develop their own private language .
These people often spend 16 hours a day together , and they bond by moaning and about the idiots on the outside .

While at the HP Technology Forum 2010 , a particular breakout session stood out in that it was all about Linux .
In fact , I ’ve stolen the title of the presentation and made it the name of this article .
Bdale Garbee , a very comprehensive and impressive individual ( also the HP Open Source & Linux Chief Technologist ) , gave a talk on the basics of Linux and HP ’s involvement in it .
He outlined the community development model ( in his words : “ no one company in charge ; a range of contributors with varied interests , abilities , and motivations ” ) and the freedom of choice ( “ users have flexibility in how they acquire support for open source technology ; any user can become a developer or pay someone to develop or support … on their behalf ; if ‘ upstream ’ ever behaves unacceptably , developers have the power to ‘ fork ' ” ) .
He said that , to profit while maintaining the openness of open source , HP needs to add unique value that customers want to pay for .
Obviously HP has embraced the open - source model as far as being profitable goes– so many aspects of IT live off of it .
Whether they like it or not , just about any company in the IT field has had to deal with open source ; I personally do n’t feel that HP has the attitude of having to deal with open source but rather getting to .
According to Garbee , HP has a somewhat unique approach to open source .
HP participates not just by funding projects but truly getting their hands dirty as a direct open source member , collaboratively supporting existing community values and behaviors and developing even more robust enterprise capabilities .
HP is especially unique in the open source field in that they have only ever used existing licences : HP has never created its own license .
In addition , HP was an early contender in fighting license proliferation , or when pieces of software cannot be combined because their licences are incompatible .
Finally , HP combines its efforts with Linux distributions in order to bring the most effective solutions for its customers .
History - wise , HP has a rich relationship with Linux and open source in general .
I did n’t know this until I began to research the company ’s history , but Hewlett - Packard was actually founded in 1939 in a garage ( similar to Google ’s beginnings ) , so HP has been around longer than most technologically - based companies these days , especially ones so publicly known .
They were well - rooted when Linux first became viable , and they were one of the earliest and widespread contributors to its cause .
HP ’s work with open source includes being a leader in the Eclipse Development Environment , running a dedicated open source and Linux R&D lab , being a key proponent in the OpenSSI project , extensively supporting SAMBA and Apache , and helping to lead and maintain Debain ; HP still actively supports and works with open source today .
On a legal note , since HP has been so involved with open source , HP ’s legal staff has had to become at least generally familiar with the collaboration processes required for open source and commercial software to mesh .
Garbee said that HP recognized very early “ the need for an explicit internal governance process to ensure intersections between proprietary development and open source were consciously managed … today , all HP commercial attorneys participate in reviews ! ”
Also , HP ’s open source legal structure has been so successful that the company has worked with various other large companies to help establish their own internal governance policies and practices .
Garbee also mentioned the now - dead SCO scuffle .
HP was the first entity to offer an indemnification program against any risks associated with the danger of SCO winning its temper tantrum .
He also mentioned that now that the SCO lawsuits are out of the way , “ Linux has emerged from this attack much stronger than before ” , and he invited anyone else to attack Linux because it would only make it stronger ( and– I ’m adding this of my own accord– bring to life more tech - humor ; we ’ll just say that “ they ’re pulling an SCO ” ) .
“ HP is absolutely committed to open source ” .
Garbee shares some statistics to back up this claim :
Over 6,500 HP service employees to implement and support Linux and open sstyle = ” width : 512 px ; height :284 px ; border : px ; ” ource worldwide
Over 3,000 open source software projects initiated
Over 2,500 HP developers focused on open source
Over 1,200 open source printer drivers provided
Finally , at the close of the session that Bdale Garbee was conducting , the topic altered slightly towards HP ’s recent acquisition of various companies and who would be next .
Garbee seemed to know about these plans but was unwilling to elaborate .
However , after some coaxing and guessing from the crowd , he did say that Novell and many others were in “ interesting situations ” , that there have been some “ interesting conversations ” , and that there are a “ rich range of possible futures ” for the company ; as for which future HP may pursue , though , he “ could n’t talk about ” .
Vague , yes , but interesting .
Very interesting .
Here at Comic - Con , BioWare is giving people the first look at Dragon Age 2 , the sequel to the ( not even a year old ) Dragon Age : Origins .
This will be another epic fantasy role - playing game , but some key changes are being made to the design .
During our play session , BioWare candidly admitted that Dragon Age Origins was n't the best - looking game around , on console or PC .
For the sequel the developer is refining the graphics engine and adjusting the art style with the goal of creating something instantly recognizable as Dragon Age .
You should be able to look at a screenshot and tell what it is without any caption , BioWare says .
The engine is also being improved to allow for more characters and creatures onscreen , which should allow for more epic battles .
While there was some initial skepticism in the gaming community when the first Dragon Age 2
The combat in Dragon Age Origins was very tactical , allowing you to issue orders to the folks in your party .
For the sequel , BioWare is aiming to keep that tactical aspect but also make it more action packed , if players wish it to be .
Today we got a taste of the new combat system with a mountaintop battle against an army of orcs .
They might have been imps or goblins or demons , actually .
We 're not nerdy enough to know the difference .
Different attacks are mapped to the X , Y , and B buttons of your controller ( we were playing on an Xbox 360 ) .
Hawk , the hero of the game , had a typical sword swipe mapped to X , a thrust mapped to Y , and a twirl that would take down all the enemies around him mapped to B .
By holding the right trigger you can access a second set of attacks , so it seems you 'll have six moves available to you at a time .
Each move has a recharge time , so you can't just keep mashing the X button to chop through enemies .
Speaking of chopping through enemies , you literally do that .
The violence is quite visceral , as a sword swipe might leave just an enemy 's torso or even their feet standing before you .
With the bumpers you can switch between characters in your party .
Anyone you 're not controlling will be handled by the AI .
If the action is getting a little too hectic you can still stop it and issue commands to your party by holding the left trigger .
This ability seems to work much like the squad commands in Mass Effect .
You can also pause the action to carefully set spell target areas .
Alongside our hero
Hawk we had a female mage fighting with us in this battle .
Her fire spells deal damage in a radius , and we were able to pause the fight and move the circle of death around the battlefield before casting .
We also got to see the new conversation system .
Dialogue has been simplified so that you only have up to three choices .
Each choice is represented by an icon that indicates whether or it's a " good , " " nasty , " or " badass " choice .
Good choices are represented by an olive branch , nasty by a Greek comedy mask , and badass by a red fist .
This is an easy way to gauge what response your dialogue choices will produce .
At key points in conversation you 'll have the opportunity to let your companions handle a situation .
When a fresh group of orcs approach , for instance , you can decide whether or not you want Hawk or his female companion to take care of them .
Whomever you choose will dispatch them all in one shot during the cut scene .
We only got a small glimpse at what Dragon Age 2 has to offer , but it was enough to whet our appetite .
The combat was satisfying and seems to offer something for action fans and more thoughtful gamers .
A couple other things we noticed : -
The intro cut scene recaps the story of Dragon Age Origins , so newcomers should be able to jump right in .-
The title screen already has a " Downloadable Content " option .

Me and my brothers always wanted a kitty , but our parents ( especially my mom ) hate pets .
When my older brother found out that one of his friend ’s cat had just had babies he came up with a master plan to fool my mom and dad .
One day , he came home with the cutest kitten in a box , saying that he found it all alone and helpless on the street , when he had actually gone over to his friend ’s house to pick it up .
Who could resist that story ?
From that day on Ricasuave ( which means something like nice and soft in Spanish ) lives in my house and enjoys tipping over flowerpots .
Of course we told our parents the truth after a few months , but they really believed it for a while .

DOSE :
3 flowers oral Brugmansia ( tea ) 2 leaves oral Brugmansia ( tea )
BODY WEIGHT : 110 lb
After my boyfriend told me about his long ago datura trip and the mystical spiky seed pods I began my own search for the plant .
I did a decent amount of research in the beginning ( hardly enough ) , and after several months of searching finally located a brugmansia tree .
My first test was with half of a large double white flower .
I made a test tea out of the flower by steeping the flower in hot water for 30 minutes , straining out the plant material , and adding honey and lemon to taste .
I experienced mild and mostly enjoyable effects .
I felt light and floaty , I had a lot of energy and my thoughts seemed to be moving all around , for lack of a better description , plus dry mouth .
I enjoyed my test tea so much , that I decided to do a larger dose as soon as I could .
A few weeks past before I found another tree , also brugmansia , but of the yellow / golden and single flower variety .
I took about 6 or 7 flowers to experiment with , as well as a few leaves .
Although I was reasonably experienced with drugs ( regular cannabis smoker , lover of MDMA , pursuer of magic mushrooms and dabbler in acid ... not to mention a taste for the opiate family ) , I really underestimated the power of the moonflower .
I can only laugh at my own stupidity now .... knowing that I thought it would be ' fun ' to drink datura tea on my way to a club .
Yikes !
My best friend Alex , myself , and three other friends were going clubbing that evening .
Everyone else in the party was going to get drunk and I thought it would be fun to be delirious ... My besty Alex barely knew what Datura was , and like I , was not expecting what happened .
That evening , I choose three flowers and two small leaves for my tea .
WAY way too much , little did I know .
It seemed like a reasonably safe dose .
One of the flowers was still budding , very green and fresh .
I chopped all the plant material up and boiled it for 30 minutes , then let it sit for about an hour .
I strained out the flowers , added sugar and lemon juice and ended up with about 8 oz . of tea .
Alex picked me up at 8 pm and I drank the entire 8 oz . of tea within 10 minutes .
The tea was tasty and I felt excited about the experience , expecting something more like acid or mushrooms ..... hehe , silly girl I was .... 8:30 pm , we meet up with our other three friends at a coffee shop near their homes so we can all ride down to LA in one car .
I am getting higher and higher by the minute .
I step out of the car to greet my friends and I feel like I 'm two feet above the ground .
Alex comments that my pupils are huge and I seem very high .
I 'm stumbling around and having trouble walking .
I begin to grow slightly concerned , never having felt this disorientated or strange before on anything .
It 's not unpleasant , but the unpredictability of it starts to frighten me .
Then the dry mouth .... oh , the horrible dry mouth .
My lips were sticking to my gums and I could barely talk it was so bad .
Alex takes me into a coffee shop to get a glass of water .
I stumble in , looking drunker , laughing , and becoming more out of it .
We all get in the car and start to drive down to LA .
I sip my water , it 's not helping and I begin to feel nauseated but I keep drinking .
I think I 'm going to vomit and I try to roll down the window but my hand wo n't seem to work .
I feel almost like I 'm underwater , and I hear people asking me questions but when I try to answer a bunch of low mumbled nonsense comes out , and I 'm started to get frightened .
Then I puke .
All over my clothes .
Thankfully it was just flower tea and water ... but now everyone in the car is upset and worried .
Alex keeps asking me if I can go to club and I think I try to say ' yes ' at first , but then admit that 'no , I can't '.... and I 'm beginning to loose moments of consciousness .
Blinking in and out of dream conversations .
I 'm afraid because I know the people in the car are unhappy .... many of them try to comfort me and tell me it 's fine , do n't worry , etc .
But I feel I 'm staring with crazy wide eyes and babbling nonsenses .
So , Alex , being a good friend , has everyone turn around , although we are nearly in LA , and drive back so he can take care of me .
I 'm sure I would have been arrested or taken to the hospital had I actually made it to the club or any public place .
I do n't remember much of the drive back .
I mostly remember trying to talk and not being able to speak up and feeling confused and worried .
I feel that the trip could have been immensely enjoyable for me , had I done in an appropriate setting , but with a bunch of anxious friends who know nothing about datura , it was pretty stressful , mostly because everyone seemed quite upset at me !
( Not that I blame them ... I did puke all over and kept trying to answer questions that no one had asked ) .
Anyway , next thing I remember is saying goodbye to our other friends as they got into their own cars and headed down to the club .
Alex ushered me into the backseat and told me to sleep .
Things got pretty weird from this point on .
I 'm laying in the backseat while he tries to drive me home , the whole time making phone calls to friends and family trying to figure out if he needs to take me to the hospital or what , I 'm totally unaware that he's on the phone because I 'm busy having conversations of my own .
He later told me I thought I was talking to my boyfriend and at one point he said I seemed to think I was conversing with the gods .
I remember sitting up frantically in the backseat and searching through my purse every few minutes , looking for my cigarettes .
He kept telling me to sleep and I would listen for a bit , then get back up .
He says that I mumbled to myself the entire drive , that I tried to open the door several times as well .
I also remember the uncomfortable bodily pain and whimpering in fear at some points , mostly in the onset of the trip .
However , I also remember feeling like a child , everything was new for the first time , I was curious and easily fascinated .... it was frustrating to have no memory though .
He would try to talk to me and mid sentence I would stop and completely forget what was going on .
He told me that I kept saying , ' Is that a new outfit Alex ?
I really like it !' over and over , even though he was n't wearing anything I had n't seen several times before .
At what I believe to be about 10:30 pm we arrive back at my house .
He pulls me out of the backseat and I can barely walk up to my door .
I 'm covered in vomit tea and complaining that I 'm very cold .
He reports that I got very belligerent when he tried to get me to follow him and that at one point I shouted obscenities at him .... although I do n't recall that part .
The next thing I remember is that we are sitting on the bench outside my front door and he 's trying to get me to sober up before he takes me inside ... which of course is not happening in the least bit .
I pretend to read the newspaper , holding it upside down but examining it closely and with interest .
He tries to talk to me to see how coherent I am , and I seem to know who he is and who I am , but little else , including the fact that I 've had datura .
About 11 pm he realizes that I am far from sobering up and decides to bite the bullet and take me inside .
The lock on my door sticks so he struggles with my key trying to unlock the door .
I remember that he kept asking me how to unlock it and trying to get me to help him , at one point I stood up from the bench to try to unlock the door myself , but fell flat on my back against the cement .
Then I started laughing , feeling no pain at all , and climbed back up on the bench .
I had a bump on my head the next day and some bruises , but no pain or serious injuries .
He finally got the door open and took me in .
I kept bumping into furniture , walls , falling over and slurring nonsensical words .
I thought I could pass for drunk in front of my family and get to my bed and pass out .
I thought I was acting reasonably sober , but apparently that 's not what everyone else saw .
Stumbling to my bedroom was the last thing I actively remembered that night .
I woke up at about 9 am the next morning , in my bed , dressed in different clothing .
I 'm still not sure who dressed me , apparently I managed to do it in my stupor .
I was wearing a t - shirt and biker shorts .
I awoke feeling oddly refreshed and awake , but with distorted vision and an odd ... lightness .... or confusion about me , but it was not unpleasant at all .
Alex called me saying , ' Do you even know what happened last night ? ' and filled me in on some of the missing memories .
It was very strange to wake up with amnesia , having never blacked out at all before .
Alex reported that I seemed to have gone totally insane and he was worried I was seriously ill .
He said that my eyes would get this scary blank look and I could stare right at him and think I was talking to someone or something else ... He also complained that I peed in the backseat !
Oops !
I do n't remember that , but knowing more about datura it does n't surprise me at all now .
Alex told me that once we got into my house he had to explain to my dad what was wrong with me .
They tried to hide me from my mom , putting me in my room and saying that I was in there talking to Alex all night .
Alex explained what datura was to my father who had never heard of such a plant , and they looked it up on the Internet .
After that ,
Alex left me in my dad 's care and went home .
Some of the missing memories from that night came back to me , things that I thought were dreams .
I remember wandering around the house and opening the fridge door and seeing it full of cans of ice cold coke .
I thought I talked to my mom at one point , but I 'm not sure if this was real .
My dad said that I looked like an alcoholic going through DTs and that it was ' really scary ' , and he said that he had to keep telling me to go back to my room because I would wander out talking to myself and inanimate objects , and I kept moving things around the house .
At one point I remember turning on the bathtub and the sink and forgetting about them ... I kept taking objects from my bedroom into the bathroom .
And the next morning when I opened the bathroom cupboard I found a bunch of my underwear and stockings stuffed in there .
I also remember looking at myself in the mirror and laughing manically into my weird blankly dilated eyes and talking to my reflection , not really knowing that it was n't another person .
I 'll never forget the look in my eyes , it really did n't seem to be me , but it was ... it was my unconscious mind , free through the power of datura , peeking back at me from behind my big black pupils .
I guess at some point I must have gotten into bed and truly fell asleep .... although I really wish I knew more about what I experienced during my delirium .
Sadly , I did n't have my trip set up right .
I wish I had had a guide who wanted to watch and help me on my journey , as well as report what I was saying and seeing .
Anyway , the next day I went into work just fine , and felt quite good but strange all day .
I felt an odd sense of power and excitement , and happiness that I was n't hurt .
I do n't believe I was in danger of dying from too much poison , although I do think the dose was too large .
However , my delirium presented a strong danger that I could be killed by walking into traffic or in some other unwitting way ( I did try to jump out of a moving car without knowing what I was doing ) .
Ultimately , it took me about a week or so to return to ' normal ' , although like many others , I do n't think I will ever fully return to my pre-datura state .
My short term memory was very impaired for most of the week following my trip and my concentration was shot .
I felt very ditsy and worried that I might not fully recover .
My mental capacities do seem to have returned for the most part now .
My vision returned to normal in about two days .
After that I have been a freer person than I ever was before .
Having struggled with anxiety and depression for years ( treating it with prozac ) , I feel that truly experiencing that delirious state may have actually helped relax my mind in some way I do n't fully understand .
I became stronger and far less passive after my trip as well .
I was going through a hard time with my boyfriend , and after the trip awoke feeling more in love with him than ever , and the feeling has remained .
I became even more obsessed with the goddess datura after that trip .
My dreams are filled with her and are more vivid and real then ever before .
Before datura I did sleep walk occasionally and talk in my sleep often , but I often felt unable to call out for help in my dreams , having no voice .
After doing datura , I talk in my sleep more than ever , but I am no longer silenced in my dreams , I can even shout out in my dreams now .
Sometimes it 's harder to distinguish what was a dream and what really happened , as the lines are certainly blurrier .
I have since experimented with datura , jimson weed in particular , several more times at much much lighter doses .
I ate 20 seeds , which produced an uncomfortably heavy body , strange illogical fear and some very interesting delusions .
The 20 seeds was an alright dose , because I only experienced a moderately delusional effect for a shorter time range .
I started getting mumbly and weird about 30 minutes after consuming the seeds , laid down into bed and started going in and out of dreams .... had a conversation with my friend Alex , who had moved to San Fransisco by then , and kept dropping my imaginary cigarette into the blankets .
The after effects almost felt kind of mushroomy to me , in that jerky colorful sort of way .
I enjoyed the after effects more than the actual trip , which at the time had that gripping fear .
Some time later I made another tea , this time using one flower and one leaf .
I only drank half the cup before the strange fear and painful body high set in .
Then I fell asleep , no hallucinations that I recall that time .
However , for now I 'm foregoing tea and other consumable methods , as the power is just too profound for my body .
Currently , I 'm experimenting with my second jar of flying ointment , made from lavender oil , ground datura leaves , flowers and seeds , all boiled in candle wax until frothy , then strained and let to cool .
So far I 've only rubbed very small amounts of it into my wrists and temples , producing excitement , shaking and that sort of datura weirdness .
For now , I only experiment with very small doses of datura .
One day I hope to experience full delirium again , with the presence of a guide to help me get the most from my trip and remain safe .
I 've been doing as much research into every area of this plant as possible , the history , science and mythology are fascinating , and I strongly recommend that everyone research all areas before beginning experimentation .
I see a lot of bad talk and fear about datura , but I guess I 'm one of the few people who have fallen in love with her ... I love the smell , the flowers , the beauty , the power , the intoxication .... her very spirit is the spirit of the dream realm , of the delirious mind , of the untamed brain stem , our primitive thoughts given control of our bodies .
As it 's been said before , it 's not recreational , it 's not traditionally ' fun ' , it can be painful and frightening , but I do believe if she calls to you , you may not be able to resist .
Doing datura , to me , is like being possessed by her .
The only advice I have for anyone looking to try it is , respect her , more than you think you should , or she may put the fear in you like you 've never known before .
Love her and perhaps she 'll imbue you with some of her power , treat her poorly and she may kill you .
Start at really small doses , work your way up to different levels before you jump in ... and never do it alone , you might need help when she takes over .
SAN FRANCISCO ( MarketWatch ) -- BP PLC temporarily suspended siphoning operations on its blown Gulf of Mexico oil well Tuesday after a drill ship collecting the oil apparently was hit by lightning , the company said .
A small fire broke out on the top of the derrick on the drill ship Discoverer Enterprise about 9:30 a.m.
Central time , according to BP BP , - 1.18 % .
It was quickly extinguished and there were no injuries .
Above : a new mall that opened today , July 17 .
If there are no building materials allowed into Gaza how did they build this shopping center , or the new Olympic - size swimming pool and water park pictured below ?
Will the Western media show these images ?
All notes below by Tom Gross
Please scroll down below for photos of the new shopping mall that opened today in Gaza .
I have also attached new photos and film of Gazas hotels , beauty spas , swimming pools , beaches and street markets -- images the BBC , New York Times and others refuse to show you .
Meanwhile , Hamas are deliberately leaving some Gazans in plastic tents , in order to fool gullible Western journalists and politicians who are brought to Gaza to witness a staged humanitarian crisis . 
As I note below , this doesnt , of course , mean that there isnt poverty in Gaza too , just as there is in most places in the world .
But the misrepresentation by the media of the situation in Gaza is shocking .
When Time magazine reports  Please spare a thought for the starving Palestinians of Gaza .
There are 1.5 million of them , most of them living hand to mouth - or when former U.S. President and Nobel peace prize laureate Jimmy Carter says  the people in Gaza are literally starving  - these are just blatant untruths .
***
Two days ago the EU pledged tens of millions of EU taxpayers  euros to add to the hundreds of millions already donated to Gaza this year , much of which has been misused to procure arms .
UPDATE , Sunday July 18 , 2010 :
Fox news producers who subscribe to this website contacted me for an interview about this story and are now running a report .
Some journalists who subscribe to this list have asked me for a quote .
You are welcome to use the following .
Political and media commentator Tom Gross said :
 On a day when ( because EU Foreign Policy Chief Baroness Ashton is in Gaza ) the BBC and other media have featured extensive reports all day long on what they term the dire economic situation in Gaza , why are they not mentioning the new shopping mall that opened there yesterday ?
 When leading news outlets mention the so - called humanitarian flotillas from Turkey , why do they omit the fact that life expectancy and literacy rates are higher , and infant mortality rates are lower in Gaza than corresponding rates in Turkey ?
Have they considered that perhaps the humanitarian flotillas ought to be going in the other direction , towards Turkey ? 
WHAT HUMANITARIAN CATASTROPHE ?
Last year , this website revealed to a Western audience pictures of the bustling , crowded food markets of Gaza that the Western media refuse to show you .
Earlier this year , I reported the new Olympic - size swimming pool of Gaza ( no shortage of building materials or water here ) and the luxury restaurants , where you can dine on steak au poivre and chicken cordon bleu .
( Over 300,000 people have viewed photos on that webpage since May , according to my website monitor . )
Now I want to draw attention to the fact that this morning , on the day that the EU again criticized Israel ( but not Egypt ) for supposedly oppressing Gazans , on a day when the BBC TV world news headlines again lead with a report about how devastated the economy in Gaza is ,  an impressive new shopping mall opened in Gaza ( photos below , followed by a selection of other photos from Gaza ) .
Will those Western journalists who write stories about starvation in Gaza and compare it to a concentration camp report this ?
Instead of reporting on the mall opening , the British - based international satellite broadcaster Sky News reported today  The humanitarian situation in Gaza remains dire . 
NEW GAZA SHOPPING MALL
Photos from Saturday , July 17 , 2010 :
More photos here .
Here is a news report in Arabic on the opening of the mall from todays Palestine Times .
( Click on each of these thumbnails to view the full photos . )
This is the official website of the Gaza mall .
( UPDATE July 22 , 2010 : Warning note :
Some browsers have reported that there may be a virus attached to the Gaza Mall site if you open it , but many others , including mine , have not found this to be the case .
In any event , so many people have been directed to the Gaza mall website -- www.gazamall.ps -- from this website that the malls websites bandwidth has been exceeded so currently you will be unable to access the site in any case if you open it .
I have posted a screenshot below , translated from Arabic . )
UPDATE , July 20 , 2010
More pictures of the mall here , here and here from The Palestine Times .
And this video of the mall has today gone up on YouTube .
( The captions that have been added to this video are not mine , nor do I approve of all of them . )
The mall is being widely featured in media throughout the Arab world , for example here ( courtesy of AP ) , but why the continuing silence from Western media who subscribe to AP and who continue to cover  the situation in Gaza day after day without mentioning the economic progress there ?
The mall includes a supermarket , international clothing stores , a food court , beauty products , a childrens playground , a restaurant , an underground carpark , and much - needed air conditioning .
The mall is not only for Gazas elite .
Tens of thousands of shoppers from Rafah to Beit Hanoun have already visited the site within days of its opening , according to Palestinian press reports .
 There are international firms such as Adidas and Lacoste and Paris top selling perfumes ,  said the head of the malls board of directors , Salah a - Din Abu Abdo .
 Nevertheless , the local traders and businessmen are those running the business .
I hope that in the future well get merchandise from other foreign chains wanting to open branches here . 
UPDATE , July 21 , 2010
Yediot Ahronot , Israels largest newspaper , whose editors subscribe to this email list , has now covered the mall .
UPDATE , July 21 , 2010
The National Post , one of Canadas largest newspapers , almost alone among Western media has run a comment piece about the Gaza mall .
It also refers to this ( Tom Gross media ) webpage .
UPDATE , July 21 , 2010
Glen Beck today showed the mall on his show on Fox .
He said that the media will gladly show you a  Palestinian with a bloody face but wont show you the Gaza shopping mall . 
Fox News Host Sean Hannity has also now featured the Gaza mall and this page is linked to from his website , as has the Drudge Report .
It is fine that Fox have featured the mall , but why arent the BBC , CNN , MSNBC , ABC , CBS , NBC , NPR , PBS and others interested in a balance , rounded approach to covering Palestinian issues ?
UPDATE , July 22 , 2010
While almost all Western journalists based in the Middle East are continuing to refuse to report on the Gaza shopping mall ( or the new Gaza childrens water park , or the new swimming pools and restaurants and resorts ) , this dispatch has now been linked to in several prominent blogs , among them that of former U.S. presidential speechwriter David Frum , Stephanie Gutmann at the ( London ) Daily Telegraph , Mark Krikorian and Jonah Goldberg on National Reviews The Corner , Melanie Phillips on the website of the British magazine The Spectator , Tim Montgomerie at Conservative Home ( under  more here ) , Charles Johnson at Little Green Footballs and Miriam Shaviv at The ( London ) Jewish Chronicle .
UPDATE , AUG .
23 , 2010
NY TIMES FINALLY COVERS THE MALL ( AND LINKS TO THIS DISPATCH )
At the top of this page , I suggested that The New York Times  the worlds most influential paper  show pictures of the mall and write about it .
Today , the paper finally did so ( on page A7 ) and linked to this dispatch ( in the sentence  How did they build a mall if no building materials are permitted into Gaza ?  )
As The New York Times writes : Gaza is not poor in the way outsiders think ,  said Nida Wishah , a 22 - year - old information technology student who was at the mall one recent afternoon .
 You cant compare our poverty with that of Africa .
( The New York Times - owned International Herald Tribune also ran this story together with the photo of the shopping mall I had used in this dispatch , on page 2 of the IHT August 24 edition . )
Since the existence of cafes , restaurants , crowded food markets , swimming pools , water parks , riding stables for children and other signs of prosperity in Gaza , have been revealed , there has been a noticeable and dramatic reduction in the number of newspaper reporters and commentators talking of a humanitarian crisis in Gaza , let alone of starvation .
Obviously , the political problems of Gaza remain , but that is another matter .

THE GUARDIAN : A RIDING CLUB THRIVES IN GAZA CITY 
Today ,
The Guardian became the latest paper to mention the Gaza shopping mall , as well as the riding club on the edge of Gaza City where , it said , young women wearing brightly - patterned headscarves and high heels order ice cream and fruit cocktails .
 The Faisal riding club hosted its first showjumping tournament in July ,  The Guardians relatively new correspondent Harriet Sherwood reports , adding that it has been open for five years and has been doing rather well . 
 Next door is the Crazy Water Park , a swimming center with chutes and slides , [ alongside ] a burgeoning number of seafront cafes ,  she adds .
Sherwoods piece is a long way from the impression of dire poverty and prison camp conditions that The Guardian has been putting out for many years .
THE REST OF THIS WEBPAGE IS FROM THE ORIGINAL DISPATCH , WRITTEN ON JULY 17 , 2010
BIAS IN A LEAGUE OF ITS OWN
Before I draw attention to other photos below , please let me restate again my overall position since several other commentators have misrepresented it recently :
I have consistently supported the creation of an independent Palestinian Arab state alongside Israel since I first became interested in politics .
But to be viable and successful it is not only a question of what Israel will give the Palestinians , but of the Palestinians themselves engaging in good governance .
There is no point in creating a new Palestinian state if it will be used as a launching ground for armed attacks on Israel , which would in turn only likely lead to a much bloodier war between Israelis and Palestinians than anything we have witnessed in the past .
In order to make sure any Palestinian state is peaceful , and respects human rights for both its own citizens and its neighbors , it is crucial for Western policy - makers not be misled into making bad policy ( as they have so often done in the past ) in part , at least , as a result of believing the distortions of Western journalists , who greatly exaggerate the suffering of Palestinians and consistently cover up for the misdeeds of Hamas and Fatah .
Of course , one should not forget that the media is full of stereotypes and mistakes about other issues .
Yet when every allowance has been made , the sustained bias against Israel is in a league of its own .
I am not for one moment suggesting that Israeli misdeeds should not be fully and unsparingly reported on -- and indeed Israel being a vigorous democracy , such misdeeds are widely reported on in the Israeli media itself , and debated in the Israeli Knesset .
But propagating the falsehoods of Fatah and Hamas propagandists has done nothing to further the legitimate aspirations of ordinary Palestinians , any more than parroting the lies of Stalin helped ordinary Russians .
Such bias , I believed , is not only wrong in itself but seriously detrimental to international efforts to bring about peace between Palestinians and Israelis .
MALNOURISHMENT ?
These are some of the photos previously carried on the dispatch  Fancy restaurants and Olympic - size swim pools : what the media wont report about Gaza ( May 25 , 2010 ) .
Above :

The restaurant is popular with Gazans holding weddings and other celebrations , UN and NGO workers , and foreign journalists .
Here are more pictures of the restaurant .
( Also see more pictures of Roots further down this dispatch . )
EVERYDAY LIFE FOR ORDINARY GAZANS
Whereas the restaurant above is one of those popular with wealthier Gazans , the pictures below show life for ordinary people in Gaza .
These photos of Gaza are from the November 26 , 2009 edition of the Hamas - controlled Gazan newspaper , Palestine Today .
It is hardly the  World War II - era concentration camp that some Western journalists and commentators have claimed Gaza resembles .

Tom Gross adds :
As I have written before , of course there is poverty in parts of Gaza .
There is poverty in parts of Israel too .
But when was the last time a foreign journalist based in Israel left the pampered lounge bars and restaurants of the King David and American Colony hotels in Jerusalem and went to check out the slum - like areas of southern Tel Aviv ?
Or the hard - hit Negev towns of Netivot or Rahat ?
Playing the manipulative game of the BBC is easy .
If we had their vast taxpayer - funded resources , we too could produce reports about parts of London , Manchester and Glasgow and make it look as though there is a humanitarian catastrophe throughout the U.K .
We could produce the same effect by selectively filming seedy parts of Paris and Rome and New York and Los Angeles too .
MAYBE THE TURKISH FLOTILLAS ARE GOING IN THE WRONG DIRECTION ?
In Turkey , life expectancy is 72.23 and infant mortality is 24.84 per 1,000 births .
In Gaza , life expectancy is 73.68 and infant mortality is 17.71 per 1,000 births .
Turkey has a literacy rate of 88.7 % while in Gaza it is 91.9 % .
( It is much lower in Egypt and other Arab countries where Israel did not establish colleges and universities in the 1970s and 1980s . )
Gazas GDP is not as high as Turkeys but it is higher than some other places in the Arab world , and it is much , much higher than most of Africa that gets 1,000th of the aid per capita that Gaza gets from the West .
( Source for above info : CIA World Factbook )
World hunger organizations report that 10 - 15 million children below the age of 5 die each year , and 50,000 people die daily .
One - third of all deaths in the world are due to poverty .
While famine kills millions of children in Africa , India , and elsewhere , life expectancy for Gaza Arabs , at 72 years , is nearly five years higher than the world average .
In Swaziland , for example , life expectancy is less than 40 years , and it is 42 years in Zambia .
Meanwhile Western governments , misled by Western media , continue to pour more and more money into Gaza for people that dont need it , while allowing black Africans to starve to death .
As the correspondent for one of Japans biggest newspapers said to me last week ,  Gaza and the West Bank are the only places in the world where I have seen refugees drive Mercedes . 

STEAK AU POIVRE AND CHICKEN CORDON BLEU
( Repeat item from May 2010 dispatch . )
If you drop by the Roots Club in Gaza , according to the Lonely Planet guidebook for Gaza and the West Bank , you can dine on steak au poivre and chicken cordon bleu .
The restaurants website in Arabic gives a window into middle class dining and the lifestyle of Hamas officials in Gaza .
And here it is in English , for all the journalists , UN types and NGO staff who regularly frequent this and other nice Gaza restaurants ( but dont tell their readers about them ) .
Please take a look at the pictures on the above website .
They are not the kind of things you see in The New York Times or CNN or in Newsweek , whose international edition last week had one of the most disgracefully misleading stories about Gaza I have ever seen , portraying it in terms that made it seem virtually reminiscent of Hiroshima after a nuclear blast .
And here is a promotional video of the club restaurant :
In case anyone doubts the authenticity of this video ( which is up on the clubs own website ) , I just called the club in Gaza City and had a nice chat with the manager who proudly confirmed business is booming and many Palestinians and international guests are dining there .
GAZAS OLYMPIC -SIZED SWIMMING POOL
Above : A Palestinian newspaper photo ( May 18 , 2010 ) shows Gazan children in the newly built Olympic - sized swimming pool which opened earlier in May 2010 , despite continuing claims by some Western journalists and NGOs that there are no building materials and a severe shortage of water in Gaza .
***
Repeat item from May 26 , 2010 dispatch :
While Western media , misled by corrupt and biased NGOs , continue to report on a humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza , the Palestinian Maan news agency reports on the Olympic - size swimming pool that opened in Gaza in mid-May 2010 ( i.e. before all the recent kerfuffle about humanitarian flotillas sailing to Gaza ) .
 Gaza , ( May 18 , 2010 ) :  Maan  Gazas first Olympic - standard swimming pool was inaugurated at the As - Sadaka club during a ceremony on Tuesday held by the Islamic Society .
 Gaza government ministers , members of the Palestinian Legislative Council , leaders of Islamic and national governing bodies , as well as club members and athletes were among those at the opening ceremony , where Secretary - General of the Islamic Society Nasim Yaseen thanked the donors who helped realize the project .
 Yaseen praised the As - Sadaka club for a number of wins in international and regional football , volleyball and table tennis matches .
 As - Sadaka athletes performed a number of swimming exercises in the new pool to mark its opening . 
STARVED OF WATER AND BUILDING MATERIALS ?
Most Israeli towns do not have an Olympic - sized municipal swimming pool .
Cities like Netanya  which have been hit by repeated Palestinian suicide attacks , car bombings , and terrorist gunmen that have left over fifty Israeli residents of the town dead and more than three hundred injured  do not have such a pool .
Nor , for example , do the Israeli towns of Sderot or Ashkelon which have been hit by thousands of Hamas rockets fired from Gaza in recent years , have an Olympic - sized municipal swimming pool .
BLAIRS SISTER-IN -LAW : GAZA IS WORLDS LARGEST CONCENTRATION CAMP 
( This is a repeat item from the dispatch of September 14 , 2008 . )
In an appalling insult to Holocaust survivors everywhere , British journalist Lauren Booth said last week that the situation in Gaza was just like a  concentration camp ,  and added that the humanitarian crisis in Gaza is on the scale of Darfur . 
Booths brother - in - law , Quartet envoy to the Middle East Tony Blair , does not share her views .
Her sister , Tony Blairs wife Cherie Blair , once made comments appearing to justify Palestinian suicide bombs against Israeli school buses , but later apologized for the remarks .
Lauren Booth was recently issued a Palestinian passport by Hamas .
Here is a photo from AFP ( Agence France Presse ) of Lauren Booth shopping in a grocery store in Gaza a few days before she made her Israeli concentration camp comments .
Does it look like Auschwitz , or Darfur ?
Here she is again in Gaza last week ( i.e. Sept. 2008 ) .
And here she is meeting Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh , who presents her with a special Palestinian diplomatic passport .
Booth writes for several British newspapers , including the Daily Mail , New Statesman , Mail on Sunday and the Sunday Times , and is often a guest on the BBC .
LUXURY NEW HOTELS , AND A SPARKLING NEW UNIVERSITY
( Photos , June 2010 )
Here are some more Palestinian websites from Gaza :
* The Islamic University of Gaza
* The Gaza Grand Palace Hotel
* The Al Deira Hotel
( Above : The Deira hotel lobby )
( Above : The Deira hotel exterior )
This is just one of several such hotels in Gaza - a territory compared to a concentration camp in supposedly respectable European newspapers .
Arab journalists are more honest than some Western ones .
Journalist Ashraf Abu Al - Houl reported from Gaza in the leading Egyptian paper Al - Ahram this week :
 A sense of absolute prosperity prevails , as manifested by the grand resorts along and near Gazas coast .
Further , the sight of the merchandise and luxuries filling the Gaza shops amazed me .
Merchandise is sold more cheaply than in Egypt . 
GETTING A FACIAL BEFORE YOUR MASSAGE
A facial runs from $ 20 to $ 75 , a one - hour massage is around $ 40 and a monthly gym membership is around $ 35 at the  Rosy spa ( above ) in Gaza .
ANOTHER SIDE OF GAZA
( Film shot , June 2010 )
More images of the horrendous situation in Gaza that you wont see on the BBC .
MORE AID , ANYBODY ?
Never mind the economic crisis in Spain , Greece and elsewhere in the EU .
On July 14 , 2010 , the EU announced increased financial support for the Palestinians .
The Palestinian Maan news agency reports :
The European Commission has agreed an additional financial package worth  71 million for the Occupied Palestinian Territory , topping up the  224 million already allocated by the EU in the 2010 European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument , as well as a reinforcement of humanitarian aid for Palestinian refugees .

Image caption Cardinal Sepe faced a media barrage at church on Sunday
A leading Italian Catholic cardinal and an ex-government minister are under investigation for corruption .
Cardinal Crescenzio Sepe , the archbishop of Naples , previously ran the department that co-ordinates the Vatican 's foreign missions .
He is accused of colluding with Pietro Lunardi , a former transport minister , to offer cut - price property deals .
He says he will co-operate with the investigation despite his immunity as a Vatican diplomatic passport holder .
Cardinal
Sepe is regarded as one of the most prominent cardinals in Italy , says the BBC's David Willey , in Rome .
Until 2006 he headed the Vatican department in control of financing overseas missions .
In that position he enjoyed access to the department 's enviable portfolio of cash and property assets .
He now faces investigation alongside Mr Lunardi , a former minister in the centre - right government of Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi , under the scope of an magistrates ' investigation into a major corruption scandal involving prominent politicians .
Unwelcome news
According to newspaper reports in Italy , the pair are alleged to have colluded over a property deal that saw Mr Lunardi buy a building in Rome from Cardinal Sepe 's department in 2004 .
The building was sold at a price noticeably below market value , it is alleged .
In a statement , the Vatican said it hoped the situation " could be cleared up fully and rapidly in order to eliminate any shadows , be they on the person [ Sepe ] or Church institutions " .
Emerging from church in Naples on Sunday , Cardinal Sepe told reporters : " The truth will emerge ... I am serene . "
Coming on top of months of revelations about sexual abuse scandals , the latest corruption allegations are unwelcome news at the Vatican , our correspondent says .
Ordaining new priests at ceremony at St Peter 's Basilica on Sunday , Pope Benedict XVI criticised priests who he said used their office to acquire power and personal prestige and to advance their careers .
Last week , interested by the noise on the interwebs about Facebook and privacy , I put together a small app using Facebook ’s API that shows exactly what information you are giving away to Facebook enabled sites .
Thinking that others might be interested , I tweeted a link and shared the app with my friends in Facebook .
Now I do n’t have a large social network about 220 followers on Twitter and 125 friends on Facebook , but the “ like ” counter for the app quickly started to grow first 10 , then 20 and after a day close to 100 !
A couple of days later , somewhat ashamed by how ugly the app looked , I did some work to pretty it up and I added a “ privacy score ” .
I then retweeted the link , did a Facebook status update and went to bed .
The next morning ( 17 May ) , I was very surprised to see that I now had 200 “ likes ” and over 1500 page views .
Over the next few days things started to grow rapidly .
I watched anxiously , concerned that my tiny little web server was going to explode …
I also started to wonder how people were actually out finding the the app .
Here is what I can surmise from looking at my site logs and analytics .
Page hits and visitors
First off here are the graphs showing the page hits ( dark blue ) and unique visits ( light blue ) per day :
As you can see the app was at peak usage on the 18th May .
To date the app has had 1936 “ likes ” and 28845 page views .
Where did all the traffic come from ?
The bulk of the traffic ( 64.55 % ) came from referring sites , 34.05 % came from direct traffic and a measly 1.4 % of the traffic was from search engines .
Of course a large percentage of the referring traffic was from Facebook , as my app allowed people to post their “ privacy score ” for all their friends to see .
The post included a handy link back to my app so that others could then easily check their score .
A total of 11.8 % of the total visitors to the app came from Facebook .
The other referring traffic was from the large number of blogs and websites that posted articles about the Facbook Privacy issue with links back to my app .
In fact there were over 100 sites that did link back to the app which is pretty staggering .
See the end of this post for a list of some of them .
The direct traffic figure of 34.05 % is interesting as it is highly unlikely that anyone was typing the URL to the app ( http://www.rabidgremlin.com/fbprivacy) directly into their browser .
I can only guess that that these visits must have come from people clicking links in various ( non-browser based ) twitter , RSS feed and ( perhaps ) mail clients .
Looking at the data I would suggest that over 45 % of the total traffic could be attributed to social networking !
( the 11.8 % from Facebook and the 34.05 % direct traffic ) .
Riding the hype curve
I suspect that the primary reason that the app became so popular so quickly was it appeared right when there was the most Internet buzz about Facebook privacy .
You can clearly see the strong build up and the equally sharp drop off in traffic as the Internet became enamoured with some other topic .
Did I WIN ?
Now if my app was a commercial product then I would say NO .
Around about the same time as my app went live so did several others such as : youropenbook.org , reclaimprivacy.org and Saveface .
I would say that reclaimprivacy.org would be a direct “ competitor ” .
If you take a look at their site they have over 238000 shares and over $ 3000 in donations .
So around 12100 % more shares / likes and roughly 60000 % more in donations !
BTW
I must give a shout - out to Brian for his donation ( and yes it is enough to buy a beer in New Zealand , thanks ) .
Clearly reclaimprivacy.org would be destroying me if we were competing businesses :)
So why did they do so much better ?
I do n’t believe that it is the “ product ” , several sites have mentioned that my app provides the most in - depth information .
I could see that perhaps it is because their app looks better but no one mentioned that my app was ugly or unusable .
I suspect that the answer is that of trust , reclaimprivacy.org has a nice domain name , the author released the source code and perhaps more importantly the author ( Matt Pizzimenti ) is readily identifiable .
On the other hand , rabidgremlin.com sounds a bit suspect and I go out of my way to keep my identity secret ( not that it would be hard to figure out who I am ) .
My suspicion is borne out by some of the descriptions of my app , such as this one :
The application is built by rabidgremlin , who does n’t tell us anything about himself ( I ’m making an assumption here ) and claims New Zealand as his home on his Twitter page .
Can you trust the site ?
I guess I ’ll need to take this into account for future projects :)

In this June 7 , 2010 photo , Apple CEO Steve Jobs uses the new iPhone 4 , at the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference in San Francisco .
Apple said Friday , July 2 , it is " stunned " to find that its latest iPhone model uses a " completely wrong " formula to show how many bars of signal strength it 's getting .
( AP Photo / Paul Sakuma )
( AP ) -- Apple Inc. said Friday that it was " stunned " to find that its iPhones have for years been using a " totally wrong " formula to determine how many bars of signal strength they are getting .
Apple said that 's the reason behind widespread complaints from users that the latest model , iPhone 4 , can show a sudden plunge in signal strength when they hold it in a way that covers a small black strip on one edge of the phone .
Users online have jokingly called this the " death grip " for the phone .
That drop seems exaggerated because the phone can wrongly display four or five bars of signal strength when it should n't , Apple said .
" Their big drop in bars is because their high bars were never real in the first place , " the company said in a letter to users .
Apple launched the iPhone 4 on June 24 in the U.S. and four other countries .
Some outside engineers and users have blamed the iPhone 4's apparent reception problems on the novel design that incorporates its antenna into the case .
But the company said that any phone will show reduced reception if held in a way that covers the antenna , usually mounted at the rear and bottom of a phone .
It maintains that iPhone 4's wireless performance is better than previous models .
And it said the incorrect signal - strength formula existed in the original iPhone , launched in 2007 .
Apple , which is based in Cupertino , Calif. , said it will fix its signal strength formula to conform to other AT&T phones through a free software update for iPhone models 3G , 3Gs and 4 within a few weeks .
" We are also making bars 1 , 2 and 3 a bit taller so they will be easier to see , " Apple said .
Despite recurring complaints about dropped calls and slow data service , particularly in the U.S. , the iPhone is a standout success , with each model selling faster than the previous one .
Apple said it sold 1.7 million iPhone 4s in its first three days , essentially running out of stock .
AT&T Inc. , the exclusive iPhone carrier in the U.S. , has faced much of the users ' blame for dropped calls and poor wireless performance .
Apple apologized to customers Friday " for any anxiety we may have caused . "

My twitter feed ( full of people in the WordPress community after meeting a ton of people at WordCamp Boulder last weekend ) unexpectedly caught fire this morning on the # thesiswp hashtag .
I had no idea what the fuss was about , but I was n’t surprised when I read into it : the item in question is Thesis , a robust premium WordPress theme that costs a minimum of $ 87 , and whose source is under a closed software license .
The debate and confusion is really about the licensing status of custom WordPress themes .
WordPress is covered by a copyleft license which requires that works derived from the software be covered by the same free , open source license ( specifically , GPL v2 . )
But “ derivative works ” is a pretty vague concept , and can be interpreted in many different ways .
That ’s why WordPress founder Matt Mullenweg wrote the Software Freedom Law Center , some of the most experienced legal experts on libre software issues .
They provided a rather comprehensive interpretation of the issue :
“ In conclusion , the WordPress themes supplied contain elements that are derivative of WordPress ’s copyrighted code .
These themes , being collections of distinct works ( images , CSS files , PHP files ) , need not be GPL - licensed as a whole .
Rather , the PHP files are subject to the requirements of the GPL while the images and CSS are not .
Third - party developers of such themes may apply restrictive copyrights to these elements if they wish . ”
This falls in between WordPress developers ’ wish that the whole community support libre software and Thesis ’ completely closed license .
Theme PHP must be GPL - compliant , but the graphics and CSS may be licensed otherwise .
As someone who makes custom themes for clients , I am familiar with the feelings of apprehension about open sourcing some of your work – often done for a client who neither knows nor cares about the finer points of free software principles .
The common fear is that by giving away your code , you also give away your business model .
This could n’t be farther from the truth .
( Unless your business model depends on every customer abiding by your copyright – a foolish strategy in light of how easy it is to pirate web app source code , not to mention an overvaluation of the originality of your source code ) ( UPDATE : WordPress ’ own Jane Wells points out that it ’s even less complicated than this for custom theme work , as you only must publish your source under GPL if the theme itself is publicly distributed . )
The truth is that many companies comply with the GPL , retain their trademarks and licensing rights ( including WordPress theme graphics and CSS ) , and do so to great profits .
Google , Apple , Facebook , Red Hat , Novell , and countless others make their GPL source available – as do many other WordPress premium theme makers .
You can sell themes as long as your PHP complies with the GPL .
Pirates can easily copy the rest of your theme regardless , but embracing the GPL not only complies with copyright law and the license terms , but it supports the ideals that made WordPress possible , and makes the whole community project stronger for everyone .
And you do n’t have to go out of your way to be financially sustainable while doing so , either .
Novell and Red Hat sell their entire OS open source under the GPL , the Mac OS X kernel and UNIX userland is open source , so there is no reason why a WordPress theme ca n’t be both GPL - compliant and profitable .
In short :
A ( complex , semi- definite ) inner product space is a complex vector space equipped with a sesquilinear form which is conjugate symmetric , in the sense that for all , and non-negative in the sense that for all .
By inspecting the non-negativity of for complex numbers , one obtains the Cauchy - Schwarz inequality
if one then defines , one then quickly concludes the triangle inequality
which then soon implies that is a semi-norm on .
If we make the additional assumption that the inner product is positive definite , i.e. that whenever is non-zero , then this semi-norm becomes a norm .
If is complete with respect to the metric induced by this norm , then is called a Hilbert space .
The above material is extremely standard , and can be found in any graduate real analysis course ; I myself covered it here .
But what is perhaps less well known ( except inside the fields of additive combinatorics and ergodic theory ) is that the above theory of classical Hilbert spaces is just the first case of a hierarchy of higher order Hilbert spaces , in which the binary inner product is replaced with a - ary inner product that obeys an appropriate generalisation of the conjugate symmetry , sesquilinearity , and positive semi-definiteness axioms .
Such inner products then obey a higher order Cauchy - Schwarz inequality , known as the Cauchy - Schwarz - Gowers inequality , and then also obey a triangle inequality and become semi-norms ( or norms , if the inner product was non-degenerate ) .
Examples of such norms and spaces include the Gowers uniformity norms , the Gowers box norms , and the Gowers - Host - Kra seminorms ; a more elementary example are the family of Lebesgue spaces when the exponent is a power of two .
They play a central role in modern additive combinatorics and to certain aspects of ergodic theory , particularly those relating to Szemerédi ’s theorem ( or its ergodic counterpart , the Furstenberg multiple recurrence theorem ) ; they also arise in the regularity theory of hypergraphs ( which is not unrelated to the other two topics ) .
A simple example to keep in mind here is the order two Hilbert space on a measure space , where the inner product takes the form
In this brief note I would like to set out the abstract theory of such higher order Hilbert spaces .
This is not new material , being already implicit in the breakthrough papers of Gowers and Host - Kra , but I just wanted to emphasise the fact that the material is abstract , and is not particularly tied to any explicit choice of norm so long as a certain axiom are satisfied .
( Also , I wanted to write things down so that I would not have to reconstruct this formalism again in the future . )
Unfortunately , the notation is quite heavy and the abstract axiom is a little strange ; it may be that there is a better way to formulate things .
In this particular case it does seem that a concrete approach is significantly clearer , but abstraction is at least possible .
Note : the discussion below is likely to be comprehensible only to readers who already have some exposure to the Gowers norms .
— 1 . Definition of a higher order Hilbert space —
Let be complex vector spaces .
Then one can form the ( algebraic ) tensor product , which can be defined as the vector space spanned by formal tensor products , subject to the constraint that the tensor product is bilinear ( i.e. that , , and similarly with the roles of and reversed ) .
More generally , one can define the tensor product of any finite family of complex vector spaces .
Given a complex vector space , one can define its complex conjugate to be the set of formal conjugates of vectors in , with the vector space operations given by
The map is then an antilinear isomorphism from to .
We adopt the convention that , thus is also an antilinear isomorphism from to .
( One can work with real higher order Hilbert spaces instead of complex ones , in which case the conjugation symbols can be completely ignored . )
For inductive reasons , it is convenient to use finite sets of labels , rather than natural numbers , to index the order of the systems we will be studying .
In any case , the cardinality of the set of labels will be the most important feature of this set .
Given a complex vector space and a finite set of labels , we form the tensor cube to be
where is the conjugation map , and when ; thus for instance , is spanned by tensor products with , is spanned by tensor products with , and so forth .
( It would be better to order the four factors in a square pattern , rather than linearly as is done here , but we have used the inferior linear ordering here for typographical reasons . )
Given any finite set of labels and any , one can form an identification
by identifying a tensor product in with
where , for and , denotes the element of that agrees with on and equals on .
We refer to this identification as , thus
is an isomorphism , and one can define the tensor product of two elements .
Thus for instance , if and are elements of , then
using the linear ordering conventions used earlier .
If we instead view as elements of rather than , then
A ( semi -) definite inner product on a complex vector space can be viewed as a linear functional on obeying a conjugation symmetry and positive ( semi - ) definiteness property , defined on tensor products as .
With this notation , the conjugation symmetry axiom becomes
and the positive semi-definiteness property becomes
with equality iff in the definite case .
Now we can define a higher order inner product space .
Definition 1
Let be a finite set of labels .
A ( semi - definite ) inner product space of order is a complex vector space , together with a linear functional that obeys the following axiom : ( Splitting axiom ) For every , is a semi- definite classical inner product on , which we identify with using as mentioned above .
We say that the inner product space is positive definite if one has whenever is non-zero .
( Note from the splitting axiom that one already has the non-strict inequality .
But the positive definiteness property is weaker than the assertion that each of the classical inner products )
For instance , if is the empty set , then an inner product space of order is just a complex vector space equipped with a linear functional from to ( which one could interpret as an expectation or a trace , if one wished ) .
If is a singleton set , then an inner product space of order is the same thing as a classical inner product space .
If , then an inner product space of order is a complex vector space equipped with a linear functional , which in particular gives rise to a quartisesquilinear (! ) form
which is a classical inner product in two different ways , thus for instance we have
for and some classical inner product on , and similarly
for some classical inner product on .
— 2 . Examples —
Let us now give the three major ( and inter - related ) examples of inner product spaces of higher order : the Gowers uniformity spaces , that arise in additive combinatorics ; the Gowers box spaces , which arise in hypergraph regularity theory , and the Gowers - Host - Kra spaces , which arise in ergodic theory .
We also remark on the much simpler example of the Lebesgue spaces of dyadic exponent .
The first example is the family of Gowers uniformity spaces , which we will define for simplicity on a finite additive group ( one can also define this norm more generally on finite subsets of abelian groups , and probably also nilpotent groups , but we will not do so here ) .
Here is a finite set of labels ; in applications one usually sets , in which case one abbreviates as .
The space is the space of all functions , and so can be canonically identified with the space of functions .
To make into an inner product space of order , we define
where is the subgroup of consisting of the parallelopipeds
This is clearly a linear functional .
To verify the splitting axiom , one observes the identity
for any and .
The right - hand side is then a semi- definite classical inner product on ; the semi- definiteness becomes more apparent if one makes the substitution .
Specialising to tensor products , we obtain the Gowers inner product
Thus , for instance , when ,
The second example is the family of the ( incomplete ) Gowers box spaces , defined on a Cartesian product of a family of measure spaces indexed by a finite set .
To avoid some minor technicalities regarding absolute integrability , we assume that all the measure spaces have finite measure ( the theory also works in the - finite case , but we will not discuss this here ) .
This space is the space of all bounded measurable functions ( here , for technical reasons , it is best not to quotient out by almost everywhere equivalence until later in the theory ) .
The tensor power can thus be identified with a subspace of ( roughly speaking , this is the subspace of “ elementary functions ” ) .
We can then define an inner product of order by the formula
for all , where and are integrated using product measure .
The verification of the splitting property is analogous to that for the Gowers uniformity spaces .
Indeed , there is the identity
for all and , where , , and for .
From this formula one can verify the inner product property without much trouble ( the main difficulty here is simply in unpacking all the notation ) .
The third example is that of the ( incomplete ) Gowers - Host - Kra spaces .
Here , is a probability space with an invertible measure - preserving shift , which of course induces a measure - preserving action of the integers on .
( One can replace the integers in the discussion that follows by more general nilpotent amenable groups , but we will stick to integer actions for simplicity . )
It is often convenient to also assume that the measure is ergodic , though this is not strictly required to define the semi-norms .
The space here is ; the power is then a subspace of .
One can define the Host - Kra measure on for any finite by the following recursive procedure .
Firstly , when is empty , then is just .
If instead is non-empty , then pick an element and view as the Cartesian product of with itself .
The shift acts on , and thus acts diagonally on by acting on each component separately .
It is not hard to show inductively from the construction that we are about to give that is invariant with respect to this diagonal shift , which we will call .
The product - algebra has an invariant factor with respect to this shift .
We then define to be the relative product of with itself relative to this invariant factor .
One can show that this definition is independent of the choice of , and that the form
is an inner product of order ; see the paper of Host and Kra for details .
A final ( and significantly simpler ) example of a inner product space of order is the Lebesgue space on some measure space , with inner product
where is the diagonal embedding from to .
For tensor products , this inner product takes the form
thus for instance when ,
We leave it as an exercise to the reader to show is indeed an inner product space of order .
This example is ( the completion of ) the Gowers - Host - Kra space in the case when the shift is trivial .
We also remark that given an inner product space of some order , given some subset of , and given a fixed vector in , one can define a weighted inner product space of order by the formula
for all , where is embedded in by extension by zero and the tensor product on the right - hand side is defined in the obvious manner .
One can check that this is indeed a weighted inner product space .
This is a generalisation of the classical fact that every vector in an inner product space naturally defines a linear functional on .
In the case of the Gowers uniformity spaces with , this construction takes to ; similarly for the Gowers box spaces .
— 3 . Basic theory —
Let be an inner product space of order for some finite non-empty .
The splitting axiom tells us that
for all , , and some inner product on .
In particular one has
for all , as well as the classical Cauchy - Schwarz inequality
If we specialise this inequality to the tensor products
for various , one concludes that
where we write for some and .
If we iterate this inequality once for each , we obtain the Cauchy - Schwarz - Gowers inequality
where
The quantity is clearly non-negative and homogeneous .
We also have the Gowers triangle inequality
which makes a semi-norm ( and in fact a norm , if the inner product space was positive definite ) .
To see this inequality , we first raise both sides to the power :
The left - hand side can be expanded as
which after expanding out using linearity and the triangle inequality , can be bounded by
which by the Cauchy - Schwarz - Gowers inequality can be bounded in turn by
which can then be factored into as required .
Note that when is a singleton set , the above argument collapses to the usual derivation of the triangle inequality from the classical Cauchy - Schwarz inequality .
It is also instructive to see how this collapses to one of the standard proofs of the triangle inequality for using a large number of applications of the Cauchy - Schwarz inequality .
In analogy with classical Hilbert spaces , one can define a Hilbert space of order to be an inner product space of order which is both positive definite and complete , so that the norm gives the structure of a Banach space .
A typical example is for a finite abelian , which is the space of all functions with the norm
where is the Pontraygin dual of ( i.e. the space of homomorphisms from to ) and is the Fourier transform .
Thus we see that is a Hilbert space of order .
More generally , for any measure space and any can be viewed as a Hilbert space of order .
The Gowers norms and Gowers - Host - Kra norms coincide in the model case when is a cyclic group with uniform measure and the standard shift .
Also , the Gowers norms can be viewed as a special case of the box norms via the identity
where is the summation operation .
Just as classical inner product spaces can be made positive definite by quotienting out the norm zero elements , and then made into a classical Hilbert space by metric completion , inner product spaces of any order can also be made positive definite and completed .
One can apply this procedure for instance to obtain the completed Gowers box spaces and the completed Gowers - Host - Kra spaces ( which become when the shift is trivial ) .
These spaces are related , but not equal , to their Lebesgue counterparts ; for instance for the Gowers - Host - Kra spaces in the ergodic setting , a repeated application of Young ’s inequality reveals the inequalities
and so contains a ( quotient ) of .
The null space of the Gowers - Host - Kra norm in in the ergodic case is quite interesting ; it turns out to be the space of bounded measurable functions whose conditional expectation on the characteristic factor of order of vanishes ; in particular , becomes a dense subspace of , embedded injectively .
It is a highly non-trivial and useful result , first obtained by Host and Kra ) , that is the inverse limit of all nilsystem factors of step at most ; this is the ergodic counterpart of the inverse conjecture for the Gowers norms .
— 4 . The category of higher order inner product spaces —
The higher order Hilbert spaces are related to each other via Hölder ’s inequality ; the pointwise product of two functions is in , the product of two functions is in , and so forth .
Furthermore , the inner products on all of these spaces are can be connected to each other via the pointwise product .
We can generalise this concept , giving the class of inner product spaces ( of arbitrary orders ) the structure of a category .
Definition 2
Let be finite sets , and let , be inner product spaces of order respectively .
An isometry from to is a linear map which preserves the inner product in the sense that where is the obvious concatenation map from to .
Given an isometry from to , and an isometry from to for some , one can form the composition by the formula and extending by linearity ; one can verify that this continues to be an isometry , and that the class of inner product spaces of arbitrary order together with isomorphisms form a category .
When is a singleton set , the above concept collapses to the classical notion of an isometry for inner product spaces .
Of course , one could specialise to the subcategory of higher order Hilbert spaces if desired .
The inner product on a higher order inner product space can now be interpreted as an isometry from that space to the space ( viewed as an inner product space of order ) , and is the unique such isometry ; in the language of category theory , this space becomes the terminal object of the category .
A model example of an isometry is the sesquilinear product map , which is an isometry from to for any .
For the Gowers - Host - Kra norms , the map is an isometry from to for any and .
To see analogous isometries for the Gowers uniformity norms , one has to generalise these norms to the “ non-ergodic ” setting when one does not average the shift parameter over the entire group , but on a subgroup .
Specifically , for finite additive groups and functions with , define the local Gowers inner product
By foliating into cosets of , one can express this local Gowers inner product as an amalgam of the ordinary Gowers inner product and a Lebesgue inner product .
For instance , one has the identity
We define the inner product space to be the space of functions from to with the above inner product .
Given any , we can then create an isometry from to by defining
( This isometry does not ostensibly depend on , except through the labels of the inner product of the target space of the isometry . )
One can obtain analogous isometries for the Gowers box norms after similarly generalising to “ non-ergodic ” settings ; we leave this as an exercise to the interested reader .
Actually , the “ derivative maps ” from inner product spaces of order to those of order can be constructed abstractly .
Indeed , one can view as an inner product space of order with the inner product defined on tensor products by
and then the map is an isometry .
One can iterate this construction and obtain a cubic complex of inner product spaces
of order for each , together with a commuting system of derivative isometries from to for each .
Conversely , one can use cubic complexes to build higher order inner product spaces :
Proposition 3
Let be a finite set .
For each , suppose that we have a vector space equipped with a - sesquilinear form and suppose that for each one has a sesquilinear product obeying the compatibility conditions whenever for all .
Suppose also that the form is a classical inner product on for every .
Then for each , is an inner product space of order , and the maps become isometries .
This proposition is established by an easy induction on the cardinality of .
Note that we do not require the derivative maps to commute with each other , although this is almost always the case in applications .

Washington ( CNN ) -- President Barack Obama emerged Thursday from a meeting with Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer proclaiming limited progress on the immigration issue that divides them , but sticking to his opposition to her state 's controversial immigration bill .
" I 've told Governor Brewer that we 've already put more resources into border security than we ever have , " Obama told CNN 's Larry King in an interview to air at 9 p.m. Thursday .
" We have got more border guards in Arizona than we ever have .
We just made decisions to put in additional National Guards .
But without comprehensive immigration reform -- that is Congress ' responsibility -- we are not going to solve this problem and that 's what we have to do . "
Brewer , who signed the state 's immigration law that Obama has called misguided , described the tone of the talks as " very cordial " but said disagreements remained .
" We know we 're not going to agree on some issues until other issues are worked out , " the Republican governor told reporters .
Brewer said Obama agreed to send staffers to Arizona " in a couple of weeks " to discuss using more federal resources to tighten the border , including allocating 1,200 National Guard troops and $ 500 million more in funds for border protection and law enforcement .
" He assured us that the majority of those resources would be coming to Arizona , " Brewer said .
She added , " I am encouraged there is going to be much better dialogue between the federal government and the state of Arizona .
I hope that that 's not wishful thinking ; I hope that that 's positive thinking . "
But Obama did not appear to concede any ground on his opposition to the Arizona law .
" Although I understand the frustration of the people of Arizona when it comes to the inflow of illegal immigrants , I do n't think this is the right way to do it .
I think this puts American citizens who look Hispanic , are Hispanic , potentially in an unfair situation . "
More importantly , he said , " it also creates the prospects of 50 different laws in 50 different states when it comes to immigration . "
He said the problem would not be solved until Congress passes " comprehensive immigration reform . "
Outside the White House , dozens of people protested the law .
" Jan Brewer , shame on you ! " they chanted .
One man wore a T - shirt that said , " Shame on Arizona . Boycott Racism . "
The meeting came after the governor said this week she is not worried about a potential legal challenge from the Obama administration over the law .
" We 'll meet you in court , " Brewer told CNN 's " John King , USA , " in a reference to the adminisration .
" I have a pretty good record of winning in court . "
The American Civil Liberties Union is leading a court challenge against the Arizona law .
U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder , who discussed the law last week with a delegation of police chiefs from Arizona , has yet to indicate whether the federal government will file a legal challenge and Obama refused comment Thursday .
" That 's really the job of the Justice Department and I made a commitment early on that I would n't be putting my thumb on the scales when these kinds of decisions are made , " the president said .
The law , which Brewer signed in April , would allow police officers to check the residency status of anyone who is being investigated for a crime or possible legal infraction if there is reasonable suspicion the person is an illegal resident .
Critics , including Holder , have said the law will promote racial profiling .
But Brewer said this week the law does not target an individual 's specific race .
She also said driver 's licenses do not prove citizenship .
" It would n't matter if you are Latino or Hispanic or Norwegian , " she said .
" If you did n't have proof of citizenship and the police officer had reasonable suspicion , he would ask and verify your citizenship .
I mean , that 's the way that it is .
That 's what the federal law says .
And that 's what the law in Arizona says . "
Brewer said she would not suspend the law even if Obama were to increase the number of U.S. troops at the Mexican border .
CNN 's Alex Mooney and Ed Henry contributed to this report .
UPDATE :
10/23/2018 NY state court sentenced me to time served without any probation , restitution or any other punishment .
The sentencing judge published his response to appellate court 's ruling , where he expressed firm disagreement with their decision to reverse one charge in his order of acquittal in the NY state case .
We filed a notice of appeal on double jeopardy grounds , as we firmly believe that NY state 's attempt to prosecute this matter after I was acquitted on similar charges in the Federal case is their second bite at the apple , which is specifically prohibited by means of the fifth amendment of the US Constitution ( " ... nor shall any person be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb ; " ) .
01/23/2017 New York 's First Department reverses acquittal decision by the lower court
04/04/2016 New
York 's DA files appeal
I would like to ask all of you , who are sympathetic to my legal case that has been revolving for the past nine years , to contribute the funds that would help me in my fight for justice .
In the course of these years I was charged in two separate criminal cases by NY federal and state governments , arising of the same incident of creating a mixed copy of open / proprietary source code on my computer upon leaving the former employer Goldman Sachs to work for a small competitive High Frequency Trading firm .
At Goldman 's behest , federal and later NY state prosecutors ( despite the double jeopardy constitutional protection ) sequentially criminally charged me for what seemed to be a policy violation conduct involving no damages - a dispute that is typically handled in civil courts .
The federal case resulted in acquittal , and the NY state case initially resulted in acquittal by the trial judge , which was recently reversed by the NY State 's appellate court that took a very broad reading of the statute , implying that a digitally transmitted copy of source code stored on a computer is tangible , with a decision directly opposite to what the federal appellate court ruled on the same element of a statute ( stating that the digital copy of source code is always intangible ) .
Consequently , I am convicted in the NY state jurisdiction for the same reason and based on the same evidence that I am acquitted of in the federal jurisdiction .
We are hopeful that the NY appellate court will fairly and impartially read the law and reinstate the acquittal on the double jeopardy grounds as the NY state case should never have been brought in the first place .

One of the selling points of Clojure is its excellent support for multithreading .
Among other features , it has a very intuitive yet powerful implementation of Software Transactional Memory .
There ’s a nice introduction on it in R. Mark Volkmann ’s famous article .
One notable feature of STM is a ref – shared binding which can only be modified inside transactions .
Transactions are wrapped in ( dosync ) and behave similarly to database transactions .
Value of a ref can be set in 3 ways : ref-set ( obvious setter ) , commute and alter .
One thing that was n’t obvious to me after reading the article was the difference between alter and commute .
They both take a ref and a function , set the ref to result of running the function on previous value of the ref , and return the new value .
I decided to test its behavior with this simple experiment .
Define an integer counter .
Start 50 threads that increase this counter with alter and print the new value .
After all threads finish , print the counter .
Then repeat with commute instead of alter .
Here ’s the sample with alter :
( def my_num ( ref 0 ) ) ( defn inc_alter [ ] ( dosync ( try ( println " Alter : " ( alter my_num inc ) ) ( catch Throwable t ( do ( println " Caught " ( .getClass t ) ) ( throw t ) ) ) ) ) ) ( defn test_alter [ ] ( let [ threads ( for [x ( range 0 50 ) ] ( Thread . #( inc_alter ) ) ) ] ( do ( println " ---- Alter ----" ) ( doall ( map #(. start % ) threads ) ) ( doall ( map #(.join % ) threads ) ) ( println " ---- After loop : ----" ) ( inc_alter ) ) ) ) ( test_alter )
The output can look like :
---- Alter ---- Alter : 1 Alter : 2 Alter : 3 ... Alter : 47 Caught clojure.lang.LockingTransaction$RetryEx Alter : 48 Caught clojure.lang.LockingTransaction$RetryEx Alter : 49 Caught clojure.lang.LockingTransaction$RetryEx Caught clojure.lang.LockingTransaction$RetryEx Alter : 50 ----
After loop : ---- Alter : 51
Explanation : when alter detects that the ref has been changed in another concurrent transaction , the whole transaction is rolled back .
Then it is automatically retried .
That ’s fairly intuitive and straightforward .
When we replace alter with commute , it ’s quite a different story .
The output can look like :
---- Commute ---- Commute : 1 Commute : 2 Commute : 3 ... Commute : 43 Commute : 45 Commute : 45 Commute : 45 Commute : 45 ----
After loop : ---- Commute : 51
The modification is commutative .
No transaction is ever rolled back .
But it also means that inside the transaction a stale value can be used , what is the reason for getting “ 45 ” several times .
It does n’t work exactly like I described earlier ( get value , commute , set value , return ) .
In fact , when commute is called it instantly returns result of running the function on the ref .
At the very end of transaction it performs the calculation again , this time synchronously ( like alter ) updating the ref .
That ’s why eventually the counter value is 51 even though the last thread printed 45 .
By the way , have a look at the sample code and think about how much it would take to implement it your Java or C# .
Not only is it multithreaded , but also synchronized , transactional ( with ACID or at least ACI ) , serializable with auto - retry , and so on .
So much going on in just 20 lines .

Targeted search yields proteins that neutralize nearly all HIV strains .
VRC01 , coloured green and blue here , neutralizes the vast majority of HIV - 1 strains .
Peter Kwong , Jonathan Stuckey , Tongquing Zhou
An antibody that can block more than 90 % of strains of HIV - 1 , the most common form of the disease , has been discovered using a method for fishing specific proteins out of the blood .
The findings , published today in Science 1,2 , could be used for vaccine design , researchers say .
It is the latest step in the quest to find a ' broadly neutralizing ' antibody , capable of blocking a large quantity of the many HIV - 1 strains known around the world .
The past year has brought a spate of HIV - 1 antibody discoveries , including the report last September of a set of antibodies that could target up to 78 % of HIV strains3 ( see ' Fresh targets give hope for HIV vaccine ' ) .
" Knowing that it 's possible for a human to make this kind of antibody really increases our optimism that it could be elicited by a vaccine , " says Gary Nabel , a virologist at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases ' Vaccine Research Center in Bethesda , Maryland , who is a co-author on the two new Science papers .
" Clearly the neutralizing - antibody field for HIV - 1 is hotting up , " says Robin Weiss , a virologist at University College London .
The results have been exciting , Weiss adds , because they address lingering concerns that antibodies against HIV - 1 may need to be very specific — targeting only a few strains — if they are to be potent .
" Our overall thinking has changed in light of these recent papers , " he says .
Unique structures
Although several antibodies against HIV - 1 have previously shown promise , they were often structurally unusual in ways that confound vaccine designers .
One region of an antibody might be unusually long , or contain a certain chemical modification — features that researchers do not know how to generate in the body using a vaccine .
" Antibodies are like people : every single one is unusual in its own specific way , " says Peter Kwong , a structural biologist at the Vaccine Research Center , and a co-author on both papers .
" These antibodies are freaks of nature . "
“ These antibodies are freaks of nature . ”
In seeking better antibodies against HIV - 1 , Nabel , Kwong and their colleagues confronted another challenge : antibodies that broadly neutralize against HIV - 1 are extremely rare .
Kwong compares the search to looking for diamonds in a pile of cubic zirconia : " If you 're simply picking up pretty rocks , you 'll never find them , " he says .
Instead , the team designed a probe to specifically pick out antibodies that act against the part of the virus 's protein envelope that interacts with the cells targeted by HIV , called CD4 + cells .
Other regions of the envelope that might stimulate an immune response were masked by replacing them with sequences from other viruses to reduce the odds of fishing out unwanted antibodies1 .
The team screened 25 million antibody - producing white blood cells , called B cells , from 15 people with HIV - 1 , searching for those that bound to their probe .
Only 29 cells fit the bill .
From those , the researchers isolated three broadly neutralizing antibodies .
Structural analysis of one of the antibodies , named VRC01 , showed that it almost exactly mimics the binding of the virus to a CD4 + cell , but for a slight 6 - ångström shift and a 43° rotation2 — roughly the difference in the position of the hour hand on a clock between midnight and 1:30 , Kwong says .
New hope , new challenges
The antibody does present its own challenges to vaccine design , however .
As the body continues to produce antibodies against a disease , the B cells undergo several rounds of mutation and subsequent selection for those antibodies that best bind their target .
This process is called affinity maturation .
As a result , most mature antibodies will harbour about 10 — 15 mutations , says Kwong .
VRC01 had 66 .
The team found that an ' immature ' form of the antibody , without the mutations , was not able to block HIV - 1 .

A vaccine based on this work would have to stimulate the body to produce antibodies like VRC01 .
At present , researchers do not fully understand how this maturation process works , making it difficult to design a vaccine that would harness it appropriately .
Nabel speculates that such a vaccine may need to be given repeatedly , to foster the production of more mature , heavily mutated antibodies , and could even consist of different components at different stages — one given to stimulate the generation of the basic VRC01 backbone , and another administered later to select a specific ' mature ' form of the antibody .
The antibodies could also be used directly in HIV - infected patients as an alternative to anti-retroviral therapy , notes Nabel .
But such a therapy would have to be shown to be more effective than exiting drugs to warrant the added expense and difficulty of administering an antibody - based therapy .
Another important step before developing a VRC01 - based vaccine is to check whether most people can generate such antibodies or only a select few .
The team is looking for the antibodies in other patients , and thus far the results are promising , says Kwong .
If those details are worked out , says Nabel , combining vaccines that elicit the VRCO1 antibody with those that yield other broadly neutralizing antibodies could potentially inhibit nearly all strains of HIV and hinder the capricious virus 's ability to evolve an escape route .
" A nice cocktail of three or so would give us a good chance of containing the virus , " he says .

You ’ll often end up with a lot of open editors in Eclipse and consequently needing to navigate between them .
You can use the mouse for this , but that often disturbs your flow when your typing , slowing you down .
That ’s why there are a number of ways to navigate between editors in Eclipse using only the keyboard .
Combined with the ability to quickly navigate views using the keyboard , it ’s an easy way to work faster and almost get rid of the mouse ( reducing company spending … well , slightly ) .

Cycle through open editors
This is probably the fastest way to navigate between editors in most cases .
When you press Ctrl +F6 ( Next Editor ) , a popup appears with a list of all open editors .
The list is sorted in order of most recently used , so if you press Ctrl +F6 and release it immediately , Eclipse will take you to the last active editor .
Press Ctrl + Shift +F6 to reverse the direction .
This is a great way of jumping between 2 editors , eg. to read something in the one while typing in the other .
Here ’s an example showing what happens when you press Ctrl +F6 while on Template .
java .
I strongly recommend mapping the Next Editor command to Ctrl + Tab in addition to ( or instead of ) Ctrl +F6 .
Just make a binding for the command Next Editor under Window > Preferences > General >
Keys – see how to manage your keyboard shortcuts for details on how to do this .
But why remap the key ?
Well , not only is it a lot easier and faster to press ( you can use one hand to do this ) , it ’s also standard for most Windows applications so you may already be familiar with it .
It makes switching editors 5 times faster ( yes , statistically proven ) .
Another way of using cycling is to press Ctrl+F6 and then press F6 repeatedly while holding down Ctrl .
Eclipse will highlight the next editor in the list until you release Ctrl , after which it will activate the highlighted editor .
This is a good way to navigate a short list of editors ( eg. 5 - 10 open editors ) but can get a bit cumbersome when there are more editors .
Quick Switch Editor
Another fast way of navigating editors is via the Quick Switch Editor functionality .
I ’ve posted another tip dedicated entirely to this feature , so wo n’t discuss it in detail here but just give a brief rundown of how it works .
Basically , it ’s great when you have a large number of editors open .
By pressing Ctrl+E , you can get a list of all open editors .
This list is searchable and even supports wildcards , which is why it ’s great for cases where you have a large number of editors open .
The Quick Switch Editor is also flexible in that it supports closing editors directly without activating them .
Here ’s an example of what you ’ll see :
Move sequentially from one editor to the next
You can also move between editors in the order of their tabs in the editor area .
To move to the next editor just press Ctrl + Page Down , while Ctrl + Page Up takes you to the previous editor .
In the example below , when you press Ctrl + Page Down , Eclipse will activate the editor Engine . java , assuming that we ’re currently positioned on TestSomeUtils .
java .
Repeating this will take you to ClientDataSource .
java .
Moving between editors sequentially is sometimes useful , but the big drawback of it is that it does n’t consider which editors you ’ve been working on recently ( in my experience , the more likely case ) so can be slow in those scenarios .
Bonus Tip :
If you ’re wondering how to move between different pages of a multipage editor ( eg. plugin.xml below ) , then just press Alt +F7 to move to the next page and Alt + Shift + F7 for the previous page .
Multipage editors used to “ break ” Ctrl + Page Down navigation in previous versions of Eclipse because they ’d hijack the key preventing you from moving to the next editor .
This has changed in Eclipse 3.5 .
Which one should I use when ?
Here are some recommendations on when to use what to work most efficiently :
If you want to quickly move between the editors you ’ve used recently , use editor cycling .
This is such a common requirement , that this is probably the editor navigation I use the most .
Remember to create an additional binding for it to Ctrl + Tab – it works a lot faster .
If you ’ve got a large list of open editor ( eg. 10 + ) then use the Quick Switch Editor .
Editor cycling is a decent choice up until about 10 editors .
If you just quickly want to browse the editors one by one to scan through them ( eg. you have a couple of XML files you want to scan briefly ) , then use the sequential navigation .
In summary , focus on learning editor cycling , then using the Quick Switch Editor .
After that , pick from some of the others depending on how you work .

Here are a couple of other ways to navigate editors , but , although they do come in handy sometimes , they may not be as efficient as the ones above .
While editing and navigating through editors , you ’ll often want to go back to the last place you were editing .
Just press Ctrl+Q and Eclipse will take you directly to the exact location where you were last editing .
This way you do n’t need to trace your steps to get back to your last edits .
Even comes in handy when you have to scroll through the same file then go back to the last edit .

Even comes in handy when you have to scroll through the same file then go back to the last edit .
Use Eclipse ’s History functionality to move back to previous editors , similar to using a browser history .
Press Alt + Left to go back to the previous editor and Alt + Right to go forward .
This is useful when switching back and forth between 2 different editors or when you want to an editor that you ’ve closed , as the history also reopens closed editors .

An overlooked - but - useful Eclipse feature is the most recently used list under the File menu .
Just press Alt+F , 1 ( or any other number that ’s indicated in the menu ) to go to the most recently opened editor .
This is useful when you ’ve accidentally closed an editor you still want to use .

A video / slideshow hybrid about the fixed point combinator
Dear Haskellers ,
thanks a lot for all your comments on my previous video !
One comment in particular got me :
No offense but that was really slow - moving .
It should not have been a video , it should have been a PDF presentation which I could have ripped through in a fraction of the runtime of the video .
Very honest and true .
The big drawback of video as a medium is that the recipient is at the mercy of the speaker ’s pace .
In fact , I probably would n’t even watch my own video as it would feel too slow for me …
… No more !
I hereby present a video / slideshow hybrid that explains the fixed point combinator in Haskell .
It ’s a series of slides you can rip through at your heart ’s content , but when you press the “ play ” button , the corresponding narration will play as a video !
The Fixed Point Combinator - video / slideshow hybrid .
You need a modern browser that supports HTML 5 and the < video > tag to view this .
tag to view this .
alternatively , download the movie - only version on archive.org
I have written a custom player in HTML 5 and JavaScript since current video formats do n’t support this use case ; the closest feature that I ’ve come across is a “ chapter track ” , but that would still miss the written notes and you ’d still have to wait to the video to fully load before being able to access the slides .
( Keep in mind that you still have to wait for the video to load if you want to start the narration in the middle of the presentation … )
And as before , I want your comments . :-)
Tell me about
Format of the presentation - Did you watch the video or did you zip through the slides ?
Technical realization , useability - Does the video player actually work ?
Any interface gotchas ?
Haskell content - Comprehensible ?
Mistakes I made ?
Effectiveness -

The BBC has quoted police officials as saying 14 were killed on the steps outside the tunnel .
At least six of the dead were said to be foreigners , ranging in age from 20 to 40 .
It appeared to have been hours before medical personnel could safely navigate the crowd and reach the tunnel , and the concert was n't immediately canceled as organizers feared a mass panic .
A bottleneck forms in the tunnel as people continue pushing forward .
Simultaneously , others attempt to move in the opposite direction to return to the railway station .
The air begins to thin and panic builds as some attempt to escape -- to no avail .
Many people are intoxicated or using drugs , and are severely dehydrated .
The Love Parade , a techno- and trance - focused DJ - led event , turned deadly late Saturday afternoon as attendees were trapped in a tunnel leading to the main concert site .
The exact cause of the crush was difficult to pinpoint , but numerous eyewitness accounts and reports from the German and British media seemed to indicate the tunnel exit was closed when it was determined the event was at capacity .
Yet those awaiting to get in continued to move forward even as those at the end of the tunnel attempted to turn around .
At least 19 people reportedly died at the Love Parade , a well - known dance event in the German city of Duisburg , and more than 340 were said to be injured as the apparent closure of a gate resulted in a suffocating crush of people .
Duisburg Mayor Adolf Sauerland was quoted in German press as saying the Love Parade was " one of the biggest tragedies the city has ever experienced , " and festival organizers announced Sunday that the event would be discontinued permanently .
News of the tragedy did not immediately reach those inside or performing at the event .
Trance star DJ Tiësto was one of Love Parade 's headliners , and the artist noted on his Twitter account that he was not informed of the incident until he was out of the country .
" I want to send my deepest condolences to the families and friends of the people who died today , " wrote Tiësto .
" I am really upset and sad about this . "
Love Parade organizer Rainer Schaller addressed the media on Sunday and said he was permanently discontinuing the dance gathering in the wake of the tragedy .
" We are going to discontinue the event in the future and that means to say the Love Parade will no longer take place , " Schaller said at Sunday 's press conference , which can be viewed on the BBC website .
The Love Parade was established in Berlin in 1989 , and this year marked the first time the event was held in Duisburg .
Last year 's event was scheduled for Bochum but was reportedly canceled over concerns about policing the massive crowd .
The tragedy comes as dance - focused events have fallen under increased scrutiny , especially in Los Angeles .
This summer 's Electric Daisy Carnival at L.A. Memorial Coliseum and adjoining Exposition Park led to more than 100 hospitalizations .
A 15 - year - old girl died of a suspected drug overdose after attending the two - day dance event .
Dance culture has since been a focus of the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors , which has established a rave task force .
Though the Insomniac Events ' Electric Daisy Carnival averaged 80,000 to 100,000 attendees per day , its size and scope paled in comparison to those of the Love Parade .
There does not yet appear to be an accurate attendance figure for the German event ; some estimates have it as high as 1.4 million .
That number may be somewhat inflated ; organizers were reportedly prepared for about 700,000 attendees .
The BBC has quoted officials as saying attendance was closer to 350,000 ; Deutsche Welle estimated it closer to 500,000 .
It 's unclear whether the figures differentiate between those who descended upon Duisburg and those who made it inside the concert venue .
Here in Los Angeles , the Coliseum Commission has imposed a temporary ban on rave contracts , although three events scheduled for the remainder of 2010 were granted approval to continue .
The commission — the joint state , county and city panel that oversees the venue — has , however , imposed new restrictions on the promoters of dance events .
Going forward , promoters must enforce a strict age limit of 18 by checking identification , hire a team of emergency - room doctors to work on - site and warn rave - goers about the dangers of the illegal drug Ecstasy , which some rave attendees see as an integral part of the experience .
Rong - Gong Lin II has more details in his recent Times story : " Coliseum imposes conditions on three scheduled raves . "
Insomniac Events issued a press release Sunday stating that its 18 - and - older policy was successfully enforced at Saturday 's dance and hip - hop Audiotistic concert , which was held at the NOS Center in San Bernardino .
" Audiotistic 2010 proves that Insomniac Events knows how to produce a safe and secure music festival and that an 18 and older policy can be implemented successfully , ” said Pasquale Rotella , Insomniac ’s chief executive , in a statement .

Tim Brown is going to the World Cup .
The All Whites vice - captain has completed a remarkable recovery from shoulder surgery and is preparing to join his All Whites team - mates in South Africa ahead of the opening match against Slovakia in Rustenburg on Tuesday .
Brown 's return to New Zealand 's 23 - man squad came after discussions between Auckland surgeon Stu Walsh and team doctor Celeste Geertsema .
" We 're thankful for the surgeon and the medical staff that looked after him for doing a tremendous job , " coach Ricki Herbert said .
" He has apparently come through everything so well . "
A team spokesman said Brown had made " a remarkable recovery " in the fortnight since the operation .
He said Wellington midfielder Cole Peverley , who was called up as replacement cover for Brown , would stay on in South Africa .
Meanwhile , All Whites captain Ryan Nelsen will sit out the team 's World Cup warm - up match against Chile today in South Africa with an ear infection .
However , a New Zealand Football Association spokesman said the influential defender was not in any doubt of missing the team 's World Cup opener against Slovakia next week .

Apple just posted up its third quarter earnings -- its first full quarter selling the iPad -- and , well , it 's raining cash in Cupertino .
The company posted a record profit of $ 3.25 b on record revenues of $ 15.7 b , which is up from $ 1.83 b and $ 9.73 b from a year ago .
The big stat ?
Apple sold 3.27 million iPads , nearly matching the 3.47 million Macs sold -- and Mac sales were up 33 percent from a year ago to set a new quarterly record .
Yeah , damn .
i Phone sales -- including the first few weeks of the iPhone 4 -- were up 61 percent from a year ago to 8.4 million , and the iPod continued its slow decline , down eight percent to 9.41 million units sold .
Over half of the Apple 's sales -- 52 percent -- were international , and Jobs is quoted saying " we have amazing new products still to come this year . "
Not a bad way to head into back - to - school and the holidays , we suppose -- we 've got a feeling those iPad numbers are just going to go up .
The conference call to discuss all this is at 5 pm ET , we 'll be covering it live right here .
The call is all done -- the full liveblog is after the break .
We did n't learn too much apart from the fact that Apple 's selling every iPhone and iPad it can make ( Tim Cook repeated this over and over ) , and that Apple 's setting aside $ 175 million in revenue to cover the free iPhone 4 cases .
Of course , given that Apple added an additional $ 4.1 billion in cash to its warchest this quarter for a total of $ 45.8 billion , that 's pretty much pocket change , but there 's the number .
“ The broad picture here is that the West has grown used to enjoying cheap raw materials over the last few decades , but is going to have to get used to the fact that prices will be going up as countries scramble to secure finite resources . ”
It was a wedding toast heard from Broadway to Bourbon Street .
During Carmelo Anthony ’s wedding Saturday night at Cipriani’s on 42nd Street , Chris Paul , the superstar New Orleans point guard , predicted a future Knicks Dream Team .
Take that , LeCon .
According to a person who spoke with wedding attendee Amar’e Stoudemire , Paul made the reference during a speech of a potential union of himself , Stoudemire and Anthony , saying , “ We ’ll form our own Big 3 , ” Paul allegedly said .
Attendee Spike Lee nearly passed out at the suggestion .
The Knicks may not have to wait until 2012 .
The Knicks have an alternate plan as they stockpile a lot of tradeable assets .
A source told The Post on Dec. 15 , when trades are permitted for free - agent signees and draft picks , the Knicks will try to put together a package for either free - agent - to - be Tony Parker or Paul .
Raymond Felton , the Knicks ’ new point guard acquired last week from Charlotte , will be eligible to be traded in December and if the Spurs or ailing Hornets like him , perhaps either point guard could be had , giving Felton a short Knick run .
A Felton / Wilson Chandler package would not be out of the question for at least Parker .
LeBron James was at the wedding , but Paul was not trying to take a dig at him .
They are close friends .
In fact , James would love nothing more for Miami and the Knicks to one day battle in the Eastern Conference Finals .
James - Dwyane Wade - Chris Bosh vs. Stoudemire - Anthony - Paul .
Can you imagine ?
Knicks fans still are getting over James ’ snub and need something to cheer them up after the two - year buildup .
The Knicks have completed their roster , and though it looks like a playoff team with upgrades of Stoudemire , Felton and athletic forward Anthony Randolph , they do n’t appear better than a No. 8 seed .
The silver lining is additions still will give them the cap space , according to , team president Donnie Walsh , to sign a max player in 2011 and 2012 .
Anthony and Parker are free agents in 2011 and Paul and Deron Williams in 2012 .
The Knicks have a assembled a bunch of moveable parts — the latest the stunning impending signing of late - blooming Russian 7 - foot - 1 center Timofey Mozgov , 24 , a Russian free agent flying well below the radar .
The deal is expected to be completed today when his clearance papers from his Russian team arrive .
Today , four more new faces will be introduced at another press conference at the team ’s Westchester practice facility — Felton and the three Golden State additions from the David Lee sign - and - trade .
Surprisingly , coach Mike D’Antoni wo n’t attend the press conference because he said it ’s more important for him to be with the Las Vegas summer - league team , which began play last night .
Nuggets coach George Karl , recovering from cancer , told MSG Network from Las Vegas he feels Anthony should sign the contract extension on the table .
“ ‘ Melo got married [ Saturday ] night , ” Karl said .
“ I do n’t know if he ’s thinking about it much .
Either way , he ’ll be fine and I think in Denver .
But it ’s very confusing , so I ’d be guessing .
I know a little more than everyone else but not much more .
We need ‘ Melo on our team . ”
So do the Knicks after the James ’ spurning .
“ I ’m surprised LeBron would n’t accept that challenge , ” MSG broadcaster / Knicks legend Walt Frazier said .
“ He did n’t want the security of fans , media , the criticism . ”

D'akari can't bear the thought of Dave and Linda returning to the dating scene .
KENEMA , SIERRA LEONE — Standing waist - deep in one of the many gravel pits that surround the city of Kenema , and struggling to fight off the harsh African sun , local diamond miner Muwomba D'akari was deeply saddened Monday to learn of Linda Hines and David Meyer 's recently canceled wedding engagement .
Advertisement
" Dave and Lulu ?
But that can't be , " said D'akari , who in early 2009 awoke at dawn , dragged his meager frame eight miles to work , and spent half a day digging out the precious stone used by Meyer to propose to his then girlfriend .
" The two of them , they were absolutely perfect for each other .
David and Linda , they were so , so in love . "
Dave and Linda

" I do not understand , " D'akari added before being whipped by mine supervisors for speaking aloud .
" How could something like this have happened ? "
The 135 - pound villager , who called the broken - off engagement a " tragedy , " and told reporters that " Linda was exactly what David needed when he met her , " spent most of Monday afternoon trying to process the news .
D'akari said he had n't felt this upset since the time his entire family was killed during Sierra Leone 's decade - long civil war .
Advertisement
" They had so much in common , " the stunned diamond miner said before momentarily blacking out from extreme exhaustion and being revived minutes later .
" And David , he was a Sagittarius , which makes total sense for someone like Linda .
Dave even got her to pursue her writing again , which she had basically given up on after college . "
" God , their poor parents , " D'akari added .
" Shirley was so excited for this wedding . "

Though reportedly not the type to cry , due in large part to his tear ducts having atrophied after years of dehydration , D'akari wept openly as he spoke of the Ohio - area couple .
From the day Meyer first stepped into that Kay Jewelers and picked out the most beautiful ring he could find , to that magical night at Da Vincenzo's when he finally got down on one knee and asked Hines to be his wife , the American pair has always filled D'akari with a sense of warmth — even hope .
" If those two can't make it work , what chance do the rest of us have ? "
D'akari asked as he clawed away in search of another alluvial deposit , one that would allow him to feed his family , if only for a few more days .
" I 'm not really a pessimist , but you hear about something like this , and you can't help but think , what 's the point of even trying ?
I 'm sorry , but this just sucks .
This just really , really sucks . "
Advertisement
Devastated by the senselessness of it all , he then looked up to the heavens , wiped several beads of sweat from his face , and summoned the strength to speak once more .
" And after all that time they spent trying to find a caterer , " D'akari said .
" What a nightmare . "

Despite his initial shock and dismay , and what appeared to be an acute case of dysentery , the Sierra Leone villager said he could never give up entirely on the idea of two people falling in love and spending the rest of their lives together , and hopes that some of the other couples he 's been able to help will fair better .
" Susan and Michael , Rebecca and Trevor , Paula and George , Rosemary and Jacob , Annabelle and Larry , Gale and Brian , Vanessa and Dale , Joyce and Jonathan , Tracy and Robert , Janet and Victor , Amanda and Harold , Sarah and Thomas , Harriet and Tom , Darla and Christopher , Luanne and William , " D'akari said .
" I wish them all the best of luck . "

Politically Erect
Updated with a reply !
23rd November 2010
Earlier in the year , I set up a site called Sexual Congress .
It allowed the internet to vote on which members of the 111th United States Congress they found most attractive .
It was rather popular , making its way into political blogs and — if my site 's statistics are anything to go by — a lot of Congressional offices .
Well , with over 800,000 votes cast and the November midterms swiftly approaching and bringing a wind of change — however slight — into the hallowed hallways and offices of Washington DC , I figured it was time to declare the winners .
And , as I'm British , there 's only one traditional way to award the winners of a meaningless , unscientific and slightly sarcastic competition like this : with cheap and tacky trophies .
Congratulations to Martin Heinrich , the Democratic representative for New Mexico's 1st District , and Mary Bono Mack , the Republican representative for California 's 45th District !
Okay , so the trophies are actually tiny .
I could n't afford enormous ones , no matter how cheap and tacky they were .
I did get them properly engraved , though .
I hand - wrote a nice letter to the two representatives , congratulating them and wishing them good luck for the midterm elections .
I 've posted the trophies off to them , priority air mail .
I 'll let you know if I get a reply .
Or if anyone from the Department of Homeland Security gets in touch .
A letter from America !
Well , I wonder what it could be ?
It has the seal of Congress on the back and everything , plus genuine American stamps .
Aww .
Thank you , Ms. Mack , and congratulations on your re-election .

Once again , it has come to my attention that humans are planning to celebrate the Fourth of July — American Independence Day — in ways that have not earned the Paw of Approval .
I ca n’t believe these shocking infractions are being repeated again this year !
Kitties , please remind your humans that only certain activities should be performed on Fourth of July , and that others must not be done — on the Fourth and preferably not on any other day , either .
Here is a list of approved activities for the Fourth for both kitties and humans :
Napping in sun patches
Playing with red , white and blue cat toys
Playing with laser toys after dark
Grilling meat , especially chicken
Serving catnip in festive bowls
Decorating the house with red , white and blue crepe paper streamers so the cats can tear them down and destroy them .
The following are expressly forbidden :
Fireworks of any sort .
It does not matter if they are legal in your town — cats have deemed them illegal , and Cat Law overrides city law in matters of fireworks .
Wasting valuable grill space with vegetables and buns
Ruining grilled meat with barbecue sauce
Water sports of any kind
Is any part of this not clear ?

The 831 researchers who will contribute to the next round of assessments of climate science and policy options by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change have been sent a letter admonishing them to “ keep a distance from the media ” and send any press inquiries about the work of their author groups to supervisors .
[ The Columbia Journalism Review has posted a piece on “ Mediaphobia . ”
There are nice posts on the panel ’s communication efforts by Bryan Walsh at Time Magazine and Kate Mackenzie at the Financial Times . ] [
At the bottom of this post I ’ve linked to a three - page “ media backgrounder ” that the climate panel sent to assessment authors on Saturday .
It ’s fascinating reading . ]
On Friday , one recipient of the letter , Edward R. Carr , an associate professor of geography at the University of South Carolina who will work on the assessment of climate impacts and adaptation options , complained about the letter in a post on his blog under the heading “ Apparently we have learned nothing … . ”
He warned that the panel appears stuck in a “ bunker mentality ” that will do little to build its credibility after a trying year of attacks by foes of restrictions on greenhouse gases and skeptics of climate science .
In an e-mail message alerting me to Carr ’s post , Mickey Glantz , a University of Colorado specialist in climate impacts in poor regions who has been an author on previous panel reports , said he agreed with Carr , adding : “ I think the I.P.C.C. is on the wrong path . ”
I know a number of supervising authors of the forthcoming reports are eager to revise policies and stress openness .
There ’s plenty of advice on the way from committees reviewing the panel ’s practices .
I also understand the reflexes involved here , particularly given how some media overplayed claims that the climate panel had erred in parts of its 2007 assessment .
But any instinct to pull back after being burned by the news process is mistaken , to my mind .
As I explained to a roomful of researchers at the National Academy of Sciences last year , in a world of expanding communication options and shrinking specialized media , scientists and their institutions need to help foster clear and open communication more than ever .
Clampdowns on press access almost always backfire .
When I was sent a copy of the letter Friday morning by another climate researcher , I immediately forwarded it to Rajendra K. Pachauri , the chairman of the climate panel , along with several supervising authors and press officers for the panel .
Friday night , Pachauri sent this response ( ascribing the delay to the time different in India , where he lives ) :
My advice to the authors on responding to the media is only in respect of queries regarding the I.P.C.C.
Some of them are new to the I.P.C.C. , and we would not want them to provide uninformed responses or opinions .
We now have in place a structure and a system in the I.P.C.C. for outreach and communications with the outside world .
The I.P.C.C. authors are not employed by the I.P.C.C. , and hence they are free to deal with the media on their own avocations and the organizations they are employed by .
But they should desist at this stage on speaking on behalf of the I.P.C.C .
I sent this followup question ( e- mail shorthand is cleaned up a bit ) :
I can see instances where reporters from , say , South Africa , would want to interview participating authors from their country about their role , their plans , their approach .
Would that be off limits ?
Here ’s Pachauri ’s reply :
Not at all .
They can certainly speak about such issues , but it would be inappropriate and premature for them to offer an opinion on what would go into a working group report or what the I.P.C.C. plans to do .
In such cases they must direct the query to the appropriate authority as I have advised them to do .
We are only trying to bring some order into the system precisely because we would like to be more transparent and systematic in responding to the media ’s growing interest in climate change — which we welcome greatly .
I sent Pachauri ’s response to Edward Carr to get his reaction , and here it is :
Pachauri ’s response is legitimate – but that is not really how his message in the letter was phrased .
If this was the concern , he should have simply said “ please do not speak on behalf of the I.P.C.C. ” — a standard admonition , even in academia , for those of us who engage in public outreach .
I ’m not saying that he is disingenuous in his response to you — but that the letter was itself tone - deaf .
For an organization that now “ has in place a structure and a system ” for outreach , you would think that someone might have picked up that this paragraph will play right into the hands of the climategate crowd , making it look like those of us on the I.P.C.C. are engaged in back - room dealings .
Optics are everything these days , and this letter utterly failed in that regard .
This , in the end , was the point of my blog post — the global change community remains absolutely terrible at outreach and publicity .
I was part of the Millennium Assessment , which very few people outside of the environmental field have ever heard about .
I was a lead author of UNEP ’s GEO - 4 ( along with Mickey ) , and the general public does n’t know about that report .
My mother ( for heaven ’s sake , my mother ! ) complains that she never hears anything about the global assessments in the news . . . and I , for one , do n’t blame the media .
In the end , the organizations running these assessments have a responsibility to take PR seriously .
And they simply do not .
Click here for a pdf file of the letter to the report authors .
Here ’s a link to the “ Background and Tips for Responding to Media ” sheet sent to climate assessment authors .
It was produced for the intergovernmental panel by Resource Media , a nonprofit communication consultancy that in 2007 created a Web site explaining the panel ’s last set of reports .
... and then , about 10,000,000 years later , the Earth explodes .
Sony has finally released a real trailer for Michel Gondry ’s Green Hornet and I think it looks great .
While I was n’t sure what to expect from a film that has Seth Rogen as the lead in an action movie , I ’m a lot more on board with the film after watching the trailer as Green Hornet is n’t trying to sell Rogen as some hard core fighter .
Instead , Rogen plays a spoiled rich kid who after the mysterious death of his father , decides to get his act together by fighting crime in the city .
I can buy that premise .
While Green Hornet has been battling some negative buzz online , I think this trailer is going to shut a lot of people up .
Judge the footage for yourself after the jump – and take a look at a few new high res images and the updated synopsis :
Here ’s the updated synopsis , the trailer and the new images .
Green Hornet gets released January 14 , 2011 .
Britt Reid ( Seth Rogen ) is the son of LA ’s most prominent and respected media magnate and perfectly happy to maintain a directionless existence on the party scene – until his father ( Tom Wilkinson ) mysteriously dies , leaving Britt his vast media empire .
Striking an unlikely friendship with one of his father ’s more industrious and inventive employees , Kato ( Jay Chou ) , they see their chance to do something meaningful for the first time in their lives : fight crime .
But in order to do this , they decide to become criminals themselves – protecting the law by breaking it , Britt becomes the vigilante The Green Hornet as he and Kato hit the streets .
Using all his ingenuity and skill , Kato builds the ultimate in advanced retro weaponry , The Black Beauty , an indestructible car equal parts firepower and horsepower .
Rolling in a mobile fortress on wheels and striking the bad guys with Kato ’s clever gadgets , The Green Hornet and Kato quickly start making a name for themselves , and with the help of Britt ’s new secretary , Lenore Case ( Cameron Diaz ) , they begin hunting down the man who controls LA ’s gritty underworld : Benjamin Chudnofsky ( Christoph Waltz ) .
But Chudnofsky has plans of his own : to swat down The Green Hornet once and for all .
Green Hornet stars Seth Rogen , Jay Chou , Christoph Waltz , Cameron Diaz , Edward James Olmos , David Harbour and Tom Wilkinson

Not that I could tell , it was probably like ~BNSF said below , the engineer was probably pushing the engine too hard .
Islamabad , Pakistan ( CNN ) --
The death toll climbed to 50 on Friday after a pair of suicide bombers detonated their explosive vests at one of Pakistan 's holiest shrines , police said .
More than 200 people were injured in the blasts outside the Data Darbar , a famous Sufi shrine complex .
Lahore Commissioner Khusro Pervez said the remains of the bombers -- a man in his 20s and another in his late teens -- have been recovered .
One of the bombs detonated in the shrine 's courtyard ; the other in the shrine 's lower lever , according to Chaudhry Shafiq Ahmed , Lahore 's senior police superintendent .
The first explosion , which occurred at 10:48 p.m.
Thursday , was followed five minutes later by a second blast , Geo TV reported .
The CNN affiliate aired surveillance footage showing the first attacker entering through a gate holding a bag .
As he passed through a metal detector , alarms went off and the man ran toward an area used for ablutions and blew himself up .
Geo TV showed a second attacker entering amid the confusion a few minutes later and running upstairs carrying a bag .
Then the video showed the explosion .
Geo TV reported that the heads of two bombers were recovered and identified .
The bombers arrived at the shrine on foot wearing 10 kilogram ( 22 pound ) jackets that had been packed with ball bearings , it said .
A witness told Geo TV that one of the bombers was wearing the traditional loose - fitting salwar kameez , a turban and slippers .
" This sickening poison of extremism will be driven out of our nation and we will not be cowed , " said Farahnaz Ispahani , a spokeswoman for President Asif Ali Zardari , in a text message to CNN .
" Peaceful worshippers have once again been targeted by those who want to destroy the fabric of this great country .
We will not forgive or forget and we will get justice for all Pakistanis murdered in cold blood -- be they Muslim , Christian , Ahmadi or of any other faith . "
Pakistan 's Punjab province , of which Lahore is the capital , has been the scene of carnage in recent weeks , including a bloody attack on a hospital and another targeting Ahmadis .
On Friday , angry Pakistanis , some wielding guns for revenge , took to the streets of Lahore in protest .
Growing weary of bloodshed in their homeland , many are troubled by its spread from the Afghan border areas to the heartland .
They are also concerned that Muslims are attacking Islamic holy sites .
Sunni and Shiites do not consider the Ahmadis as a part of Islam because they do not regard Mohammed as the last prophet sent by God .
As such , they have been targeted by Islamic extremists .
Friday 's attack was at a revered Sufi shrine .
Sufism is an ancient , mystical form of Islam that is generally more tolerant .
The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan expressed alarm over the attacks and called on both the government and Muslim clerics to stand up to extremism .
" It is a matter of grave concern that despite repeated official claims of breaking the back of terrorists , they retain the ability to launch vicious terrorist attacks across the country almost at will , " the commission said in a statement Friday .
" The assault demonstrates the potency of militant groups that the government incessantly repeats operate from sanctuaries in the tribal areas bordering Afghanistan , " the statement said .
" Equally frustrating have been clerics ' stock statement that no Muslim can commit such atrocities .
Instead of living in denial , the clerics need to reflect on the reasons for religious extremism in Pakistan and the possible consequences and their own contribution to the promotion of intolerance and the cult of violence . "
CNN 's Nasir Habib , Nic Robertson , Nazneen Akbari , Thomas Evans , Katy Byron and Journalist Fayyaz Addrees contributed to this report .

Why the Lucky Stiff was one of the brightest and most inspiring programmers in activity .
He became famous through a series of blogs and through the incredible amount of open - source projects that he maintained over the course of more than seven years .
Why ’s popularity grew along with the Ruby programming language ’s popularity .
When the Rails hype took off in 2005 , a great number of young developers started looking to learn about Ruby , and that ’s when most of them found Why ’s ( Poignant ) Guide to Ruby , a Creative Commons book in both HTML and PDF that embodied all of its author ’s characteristics : an uneasy artistic mind with a different take on what programming is all about .
Further Reading on SmashingMag :
Even those who did n’t happen to read the Poignant Guide could not program in Ruby without a touch of _ Why ’s brilliance .
He had by then written several libraries that were fundamental parts of everyday programming tasks , such as Hpricot , an HTML parser with an API that somehow resembles jQuery ’s DOM manipulation API .
You may have noticed that we ’re referring to _ Why in the past .
So , the question is , is he gone ?
Yes .
For as much as he was worth to us , we had only his online persona , Why the Lucky Stiff .
No one knew his real name or his job or where he came from .
There was just _ Why in all his eeriness and awesomeness .
And _ Why is no more .
On August 2009 , he closed nearly all of his online accounts and websites , including his source - code repositories , with all the code that thousands of developers have come to depend of .
The disappearance has left a horde of orphans of _ Why ’s code and activity .
And while no one knows for sure why he did what he did , there are solid theories , the strongest one being that his real identity had been discovered , however weird that sounds .
This article tells the tale of this post - modern artist whom people came to know as Why the Lucky Stiff .
“ Is n’t it crazy … you make some cartoons at home or record some music in your basement and suddenly you ’re famous around the world . ” —
_ Why , in conversation with Geoffrey Grosenbach
Freelance Professor ( By Fated Appointment Only )
On his blog , _ Why described himself as a “ freelance teacher , ” even though he never took teaching jobs , freelance or otherwise .
He explained this description in a presentation at the Art && Code Symposium .
He said that he teaches “ on fated appointments only . ”
As he explained it , this means that he teaches arbitrary kids and teenagers in arbitrary places whenever the opportunities arise .
He tells the story of a day when he was on a train working on code as a group of kids was playing around and looking at what he was doing .
They were intrigued to find that he was “ hacking . ”
He showed them what he was doing ( a simple game ) , and they started playing with the code , and that was his first teaching session .
However esoteric his teaching ideology seems to be , it ’s backed up by strong and meaningful arguments , all of which _ Why lays out in his essay ” The Little Coder ’s Predicament ” and later on in the Hackety Hack ’s manifesto .
The gist of it is that in the early computer days , machines such as the Comodore 64 were easily programmable ; a kid could play with it and make sounds with code and build simple games .
Nowadays , computers are incredibly more powerful and proportionally less hackable .
This hackability that _ Why identifies and the process of discovering how to “ control a computer ” is the moment that many brilliant computer programmers are born .
As just one example , this is exactly how Linus Torvalds , creator of Linux , started programming .
Hackety
Hack is a manifesto not only in words but in code .
It is software that runs on Windows and serves as a platform on which kids can write programs very easily .
It makes it possible to write a blog in six lines of code or your own IM in a few more lines .
Here ’s an inspiring video of _ Why ’s presentation at the Art && Code Symposium , where he talks about the essence of programming and his motivation for Hackety Hack .
Be sure not to miss the part where he presents his card game , Kaxxt , and explains the very nature of the craft of programming .
http://vimeo.com/5047563
_ Why unexpectedly showed up at my house for a BBQ one day .
I offered to drive him back to his hotel or home , but he insisted on taking a bus schedule and finding his own way .
— Geoffrey Grosenbach
Why ’s ( Poignant ) Guide To Ruby , And Nobody Knows Shoes
Besides teaching by fated appointment , _ Why has mostly been famous for his introductory tutorial to the Ruby programming language , called “ Why ’s ( Poignant ) Guide to Ruby . ”
The Poignant Guide is completely different than what one might expect from a programming language book .
It ’s less of a technical guide and more of a stream - of - consciousness humor novel , full of cartoons , that happens to teach you how to write Ruby programs .
The guide is licensed under Creative Commons and can be accessed in HTML or downloaded as a PDF .
It not only became a cult hit in the Ruby community but made an impact on many programmers around the globe .
What ’s even more powerful , the Poignant Guide helped shape the culture of many people who were new to programming .
His inspiration can be seen in projects such as Learn you a Haskell for great good and in programmers such as Ryan Dahl ( creator of node.js ) , and his comics and art have also made their mark on people .
_ Why wrote a second book , a tutorial , reference , quick - start guide to his program Shoes .
Shoes is a GUI toolkit for building cross-platform desktop applications very easily with Ruby ’s clean syntax .
The book is called Nobody Knows Shoes and is another work of art that ’s underrated , even among the _Why initiated .
Conceived for print and PDF , NKS ’s editorial design is an achievement : concise ( however randomly arranged ) , and readable ( however chaotic ) .
The book starts with a montage of a figure moving “ towards the book , ” while another character cries , “ Midas , you should n’t walk that way !! [ …]
NooooOOO , u ’re going to run smack into a nerdy computer booooooookkk … ”
The last page of the book reads , “ Midas knows Shoes . ”
This is only one of the almost practical jokes that are so common of him .
I appreciate your remarks , but I have a hard time believing that anyone would like my art .
I will definitely die without recognition , and few will ever see the work I do .
But I like it that way a lot !!
One of the worst things a person can get in life is recognition .
But a scalp rash is very , very bad as well .
I have had some serious scalp rashes , and I also have thrown up blood quite a few times along the way .

Why the Lucky Stiff , in an email response to Fábio Akita
Blogging
Through his persona “ life spam , ” _ Why maintained several blogs .
His main website , whytheluckystiff .
net was where he kept random thoughts , cartoons , poems and other stories .
The blog ’s categories were “ Stories , ” “ Comics , ” “ Incidents , ” “ Quatrains , ” “ Hacking ” and “ Five - Minute Plays for Twins Who Do n’t Have Their Other Twin With Them And An Unlimited Supply of Animals . ”
It ’s also where he kept links to all of his other creations , such as books and blogs .
When Ruby was still virtually unknown outside of Japan , _ Why created a blog called RedHanded , on which he would evangelize the language , discuss its features and consolidate the community .
The website was shut down after Ruby grew and particularly after the boom of Ruby - oriented material started in the US .
The blog served its purpose really well .
You could find interviews and comments from people who would later become Web “ celebrities , ” such as David Heinemeir Hansson , creator of the Ruby on Rails framework and partner at 37 Signals .
David was himself subjected to many jokes from _ Why , along the way .
Hackety.org was the blog on which _ Why talked about programming topics in the context of his Hackety Hack manifesto .
There , he showcased his incredible knowledge of “ hackety ” resources , such as simple game engines and image - and sound - processing libraries .
It is also a joyful read for programming - language geeks and underground - art lovers .
Another , relatively unknown blog of _ Why ’s was the image - only website that contained precious scraps of randomly found imagery .
The blog could hardly be defined , although the words “ eerie , ” “ surreal ” and “ kitsch ” came up often .
It was called (.~ ) what a quiet stiff ( ~. ) .
_ Why was the one who coined the term “ Tumblelog , ” in reference to the blog Anarchaia by Christian Neukirchen .
On his blog RedHanded , he stated , “ Blogging has mutated into simpler forms ( specifically , link - and mob - and aud - and vid- variant ) , but I do n’t think I ’ve seen a blog like Chris Neukirchen ’s Anarchaia , which fudges together a bunch of disparate forms of citation ( links , quotes , flickrings ) into a very long and narrow and distracted tumblelog . ”
Music
Besides writing the book , creating the cartoon and making the Poignant Guide website , _ Why created with his band , The Thirsty Cups , a soundtrack , each of whose tracks accompany each of the Guide ’s chapters .
Needless to say , the the music style is wildly imaginative , fun and unpredictable .
Not many know that he released an album to go along with Why ’s Poignant Guide to Ruby .
One of my favorite songs from the album is the one for the second chapter : “ This Book Is Made ( of Rabbits and Lemonade ) . ”
Nothing captures the artistic ethos of _ Why better than the above song .
— John Resig on ejohn.org
Being a big fan of music , _ Why also created an interesting Ruby library to generate 8 - bit music .
It ’s called bloopsaphone , and as an example , one could play the Simpson ’s theme with this little code :
require ‘ rubygems ’ require ‘ bloops ’ b = Bloops.new b.tempo = 180 sound = b.sound Bloops :: SQUARE sound.volume = 0.4 sound . sustain = 0.3 sound . attack = 0.1 sound . decay = 0.3 b.tune sound , “ 32 + C E F# 8:A G E C – 8:A 8 : F# 8 : F# 8 : F# 2: G ” b.play sleep 1 while !b. stopped ?
My first experience seeing _ Why in person was in 2005 at FOSCON in Portland , Oregon .
It was a free gathering of Rubyists on one evening during the larger OSCON conference .
We met in the back of the FreeGeek computer recycling shop , a perfect venue .
You walk through shelves full of old computer equipment and parts ready to be rebuilt and donated to people .
_ Why and his three - person band got on stage and played a set of original songs with humorous lyrics about Ruby .
Partway through , his laptop ran out of power , and they brought him a random power adapter from the shop .
Always a non-conformist within the Ruby community , he had a Linux laptop , while most other people had Apple gear .
As he plugged it in , the lights dimmed and the laptop jolted on to full brightness .
We were sure that it was going to burst into flames , but he survived .
As would characterize many other concerts , he was n't there just to sing to the audience .
He wrote a server that the audience could connect to on Ruby 's DRb prompt and change the colors on the screen .
It got quite a few laughs as it sputtered to life , and a few people were actually able to connect .
I still remember that event as one of the highlights of any Ruby " conference " I 've been to since .
— Geoffrey Grosenbach
Not With A Bang …
Why the Lucky Stiff vanished on August 2009 .
Almost all of his Internet accounts were closed , all his websites went down , even the code repositories that he released as open source were removed .
The real motive for his disappearance is and will always be a mystery , but the best clue is that his identity had finally been discovered .
People had gathered enough evidence to be sure about his real name and occupation .
They found new content on the Internet and new music bands .
All of the personal details that he was trying to keep private became public : his wife ’s name , his sister ’s name .
With that , he vanished .
People responded in different ways .
Some were understanding , others disapproving .
Seeing the complete deletion of his online persona does n’t terribly surprise me .
Back in 2007 , _ Why closed his main blog ( RedHanded ) .
That event truly shocked me , but it helped me to better understand him as a person .
The blog , even though he had put years of work into it and people strongly identified him with it , was immaterial .
It did n’t feel like the right place to talk anymore , so he moved on to another place , abandoning the old site .
— John Resig , creator of jQuery
Taking all of your code offline and erasing your whole persona without so much as a warning or helping people take over projects they spent years investing in is a dickhead thing to do .
That ’s a rough thing to say , but I feel very strongly about this , because while I respect the idea of impermanence , I have no respect for someone who has such a complete disregard for other people ’s investments and feelings .
— Zed Shaw , creator of the Mongrel Web server
Despite the different takes on his decision to erase his presence and work , everyone who knew _ Why shares a sadness for his absence .
Why the Lucky Stiff was a fixture in the Ruby community .
He helped give us that quirky character and a sense of wonder and fun .
I ’m very sad to see _ Why go .
I ’m sure he had his reasons , but it ’s a big loss nonetheless .
— David Heinemeier Hansson
His virtual suicide , like the self - induced death of a friend or loved one , leaves an indescribable hole inside me .
I do n't like it , I was n't ready for it , and I do n't think it 's fair that he did it .
Nonetheless , as a real - life comic - book character , in death he will continue to be my muse to create fun things that exist only to be shiny and interesting .
Long live coding for fun .
Thank you _ Why . — Dr. Nic
To _ Why : Thank you for bringing your code and art to us over the past couple of years .
It 's been greatly appreciated , more than you can know .
Please continue to enjoy your life and bring your joy and whimsy to others all over the world .
— John Resig
Unfortunately , he decided to go away , and there 's no official explanation for that .
He 's just gone .
After everything he did , I think no one can demand anything from him . :-)
But we will miss him because he was an exceptional programmer .
— Fábio Akita
What Can We Learn From _ Why
Why the Lucky Stiff was above all else an artist who treated whatever he did , whether a programming language in C or a presentation at a conference , as a work of art .
He inspires people because he planned everything he did with an aesthetic mindset .
Fun
The single most important lesson that people say they have learned from the Ruby programming language is a lesson that _ Why ’s work embodies in its code : Programming ( or whatever you do ) should be fun .
There must be joy in your craft , and there is precious value in tinkering and playing around .
Pathos
Pathos is “ the power to evoke feelings ” .
It is also one of the three modes of persuasion in rhetoric .
If what you do does not evoke feeling in people , then it may as well be dead .
_ Why ’s work certainly did not please everyone , but people could n’t , and still can ’t , be indifferent to it .
Do n’t Be Afraid to Take Risks
This is where _ Why gets controversial .
Contrary to what most developers believe and abide by , _Why ’s programming style was not clean , readable or tested .
Quite the opposite .
This would give most “ Agile ” programmers the shivers , but _ Why had a point , as this letter that he wrote in 2005 explains quite plainly .
I do not write tests for my code .
I do not write very many comments .
I change styles very frequently .
And most of all , I shun the predominant styles of coding , because that would go against the very essence of experimentation .
In short : all I do is muck around .
So , my way of measuring a great programmer is different from some prevailing thought on the subject .
I would like to hear what Matz would say about this .
You should ask him , seriously .
I admire programmers who take risks .
They are n’t afraid to write dangerous or “ crappy ” code .
If you worry too much about being clean and tidy , you ca n’t push the boundaries ( I do n’t think ! ) .
I also admire programmers who refuse to stick with one idea about the “ way the world is . ”
These programmers ignore protocol and procedure .
I really like Autrijus Tang because he embraces all languages and all procedures .
There is no wrong way in his world .
Anyway , you say you want to become better .
I mean that ’s really all you need .
You feel driven , so stick with it .
I would also start writing short scripts to share with people on the Web .
Little Ruby scripts or Rails programs or MouseHole scripts to show off .
Twenty lines here and there , and soon people will be beating you up and you ’ll be scrambling to build on those scripts and figure out your style and newer innovations and so on .
— _why
An insightful letter .
_ Why is defending an idea here that has been advocated by different people in different ways .
The point is not about whether to write tests .
The point is , do n’t be scared of taking risks .
If you ’re familiar with Seth Godin ’s work , you ’ll recognize that _ Why is all about “ shipping . ”
He just creates things and gets them out there in the wild , unafraid whether people think it ’s “ crappy ” or “ unprofessional . ”
When you do n’t create things , you become defined by your tastes rather than ability .
Your tastes only narrow and exclude people .
so create . —

Mary Norris started working at The New Yorker thirty - one years ago , in the editorial library , moving on to the collating department and the copy desk .
Since 1993 , she has been a page O.K. ’er , or query proofreader .
She has written for The Talk of the Town and contributes to the New Yorker books blog .
She is working on a memoir about having a transsexual sibling , the legendary Baby Dee .
You can read Mary ’s fabulously entertaining blog : “ The Alternate Side Parking Reader . ”
By the way , if you want to learn more about copy editing from those who are the best in the business , check out : The New Yorker Festival ( October 16 - 18 ) .
This year there is a master class in copy editing , on Sunday , October 18th , at 2 P.M. , with Ann Goldstein , the head of the copy department ; Elizabeth Pearson - Griffiths ; and Mary Norris .
A program guide to the festival is in the issue of September 21 , 2009 , and online .
I want to talk to Mary about what really goes on at America ’s most prestigious literary magazine .
Andy : Mary , I understand that you often write some extremely well - received books under the pseudonym : “ Malcolm Gladwell . ”
Is this true ?
Mary : Hah !
Are you trying to get me in trouble ?
Malcolm Gladwell is an incredible phenomenon .
He is not a made - up composite of a writer but a real person , and though he must be a millionaire by now , amazingly , he continues to write .
Andy :
Can you describe for us what a typical day is for you at The New Yorker ?
Mary :
The hours at The New Yorker are from ten to six , and I try to be on time , as it is embarrassing to be chronically late when you do n’t have to be at the office till ten .
We have a weekly schedule for closing the contents of an issue in an orderly fashion : fiction closes early in the week , critics at midweek , and the longer , more demanding pieces near the end of the week ;
Talk of the Town and Comment go to press last , on Friday .
The head of the copy department , Ann Goldstein , parcels out the week ’s tasks , matching up who is available with what needs to be done .
If the lineup changes , we readjust .
There are four full - time O.K. ’ers , as well as a team of about six proofreaders , some of whom act as O.K. ’ers when we need them .
Basically , on the day a piece closes , you read it , and give the editor your query proof , which will also contain the queries of a second proofreader , and after the editor has entered all the acceptable changes and sent the new version to the Makeup Department , you read that new version .
There will sometimes be a “ closing meeting , ” when the editor , the writer , the fact checker , and the O.K. ’er sit down together over the page proof and discuss final changes .
The O.K. ’er then copies these changes onto a pristine proof called the Reader ’s ( to keep the paper trail ) and enters them into the electronic file , and sends the revised piece back to Makeup .
The next version is read against the Reader ’s proof by another layer of proofreaders , the night foundry readers .
The system is full of redundancy and safety nets .
Andy : Wow !
That is even more proofreading than I do on this blog .
You do copy editing there .
What is a copy editor ?
How is it different from a line editor ?
Mary :
The job descriptions at The New Yorker are different from those at book publishing houses and other magazines .
We have a copy desk , and the job of the copy editor is to do the first pass on a piece , when the manuscript is “ set up , ” that is , set in type for general distribution .
At this stage , the copy editor makes minimal changes , in spelling and punctuation , to conform to New Yorker style .
You may have noticed that we spell “ theatre ” the British way , reversing the “ er ” to “ re , ” and double consonants before suffixes ( “ travelled , ” rather than “ traveled ” ) ; we use the diaeresis in words like “ coöperate ” and “ reëlect ” ; we prefer the serial comma ; we spell out round numbers , even big ones .
The copy editor does not make any interpretive changes .
Next ( and you wo n’t find this job anyplace else ) a piece is “ Goulded . ”
This used to be the domain of the legendary Eleanor Gould Packard , a grammarian and a genius whose old office I now occupy , though I am neither a grammarian nor a genius ( except for real estate : the office has a great view ) .
One of the query proofreaders , on a day when she is not O.K. ’ing a piece , reads the galleys of a piece that is scheduled for a future issue , fixing spelling and punctuation , of course , but also making more subtle suggestions .
Query proofreaders at The New Yorker are probably more like line editors at other publications .
We go over the piece twice .
We fix danglers .
We try to improve the sentences , making sure that the author is saying what he or she intends to say .
Eleanor Gould was big on clarity , and I have absorbed some of that .
Basically , you ’re giving the piece a really close reading .
When a piece is scheduled to run in the magazine , we read it again , twice .
As I said above , in addition to the O.K. ’er , each piece has a second reader , to back up the O.K. ’er .
The O.K. ’er then has the duty of reading the piece yet again , to make sure no mistakes have been introduced , and also to smooth things out .
Sometimes a fact checker ’s language does not blend in with the writer ’s voice , although the checkers work closely with the writers .
Any material added by the writer or the checker has to be copy - edited .
This takes as long as it takes , and we do n’t rush out at 6 P.M .
Andy : I have always heard that The New Yorker had extremely rigorous standards for copy editing and fact checking .
( Or perhaps I should say : “ cöpy ёditing ” )
Can you talk about that ?
How is your job copy editing different from , say , that of a copy editor at the National Enquirer ?
Mary : I do n’t know what it ’s like to be a copy editor at the National Enquirer .
The main thing here is to respect the writer .
The writers do n’t have to do everything we want them to — we make suggestions .
The ideal would be to give an editor a proof and have all your suggestions meet with approval .
Sometimes you notice that your suggestions have not been taken , so if something bothers you , you try again .
Sometimes you wear them down , sometimes you cave .
I have been on both sides of the process , as a writer and as a query proofreader .
Being edited sometimes felt like having my bones reset on a torture rack .
I do n’t ever want to do that to a writer , but I probably have from time to time .
“ What is this , the adverb police ? ” a writer who shall remain nameless once said in my earshot .
“ You betcha , ” I wanted to say .
I do n’t remove every word ending in “ ly , ” but I like economy and concision .
Andy : The New Yorker has such an iconic status in the literary world .
When Vicky Raab quoted me in the New Yorker blog , I went around for weeks telling my friends I had become a “ New Yorker writer . ”
Does the office reflect this kind of exalted status ?
Or is the workplace like everywhere else ?
You know , people complaining about the bad plumbing , that sort of thing .
Mary : Bad plumbing !
How did you know ?
There is someone who trashes the ladies ’ room regularly , and we ca n’t figure out who it is .
When you have worked at a place for a while , it is bound to lose its mystique .
But as someone who has occasionally been published in The New Yorker , I cannot deny that it is always a thrill to have a piece accepted .
You belong to the same tradition as some great , great writers .
And although sometimes you are just churning your way through the week , other times you ’re getting paid to read something great .
We are probably all in this business because we like to read , right ?
So what could be better ?
Andy : I have always imagined that most of the real workers at the magazine , the guys who do n’t do the featured stories , are writers in their other lives .
Probably pretty good writers .
Is that true ?
Is TNY a good gig for a writer ?
Connections and all that stuff ?
Entrée to parties at the Hamptons ?
Mary :
You ’re right there .
Many of the people on the editorial staff have the will to write : they ’re poets , essayists , novelists , playwrights , journalists .
I have a novel in my bottom drawer , if you ’d like to take a look at it .
I guess what we have is access : I can e-mail the editor - in - chief , or talk to an editor if I have an idea .
But , obviously , the staff writers are given preference , and you are competing with them just like anyone else .
Sometimes people leave The New Yorker to take writing jobs elsewhere .
I have never been invited to a party in the Hamptons , but maybe I ’m just not working the connections assiduously enough .
One of the perks is grabbing books off the book bench — review copies that get sent to the magazine ( there ’s no way we can review all the books that get sent here ) .
Recently I asked Roger Angell to sign a copy of his 2008 Christmas poem for my second cousin Dennis Kucinich ( rhymes with “ spinach ” ) , whom I met at a family reunion .
Another perk is getting to hobnob with the cartoonists .
When a copy of the magazine lands on my desk on Monday morning , the first thing I do is still to flip through it looking at the cartoons .
Andy :
You have worked under William Shawn , Robert Gottlieb , Tina Brown , and David Remnick .
Do you have a sense that there was a “ golden age ” of TNY or are we living in it now ?
Mary : Hmmm .
Sometimes when I have occasion to look back at an issue from the Shawn days , I am moved by the beauty of those vintage magazines : the lines of type were fitted character by character , the hot type is very alive , the black - and - white columns of print have a classic purity .
Bob Gottlieb was careful to maintain that , though he introduced some changes .
Tina Brown brought in color and photography , and shortened the length of pieces ( and probably the attention span of the general reader ) .
I think that what David Remnick has done is bring his newsman ’s nose to the job .
Remnick has succeeded in making The New Yorker a vital part of the national conversation .
We seem to have found our voice after 9/11 .
On the other hand , you find fewer quirky pieces that may not be particularly newsworthy but that readers love .
For instance , “ Uncle Tungsten , ” by Oliver Sacks .
( I still regret making him spell “ sulfur ” our way , with the “ f , ” when he wanted to spell it the old - fashioned British way , “ sulphur , ” which he ’d grown up with . )
Ian Frazier ’s two - part piece on his travels in Siberia is a good recent example of a beautiful , funny , interesting , old - fashioned piece of writing .
A good writer can make you care about anything .
Andy :
Is your job satisfying ?
Mary :
The thing I like most about my job is that it draws on my entire background .
I know a little Italian and Greek that sometimes come in handy .
I once caught a mistake in Middle English ( in a piece by Andrew Porter yet ) — the only time my graduate degree has ever had a practical use .
I know the name of the airport in Cleveland , and that can be useful when you ’re reading a piece of fiction by a Southern writer who is making things up about northern Ohio .
It ’s redemptive to have a practical use for the arcana of Roman Catholicism .
Andy :
What qualities make a person a good candidate for copy editing ?
Mary : Self - doubt .
It ’s always good , before changing something , to stop and wonder if this is a mistake or if the writer did this for a reason .
When you ’ve read a piece five or more times , it is tempting to believe that it must be perfect , but you have to stay alert for anything you might have missed .
Eternal vigilance !
It also helps to have read widely ( and well ) , and to have noticed , while you ’re at it , how words are spelled .
Of course you have to be attentive to details — you have to be a bit of a nitpicker yet be constructive in your nit-picking .
You have to love language .
And not be too proud to run spell - check .
Andy : I hope this is n’t too naughty to ask , but can you tell me the three biggest style errors that you have gotten from New Yorker writers ?
Mary :
When I first got into the copy - editing game , I wondered why writers persisted in the error of their ways when they must have seen the changes that the editors made .
Finally I figured out that it is n’t the writers ’ job to style their own copy .
For writers , having to think about those things is constricting .
Plus , if they did , it would put us out of a job .
But here are a few things that have irked or puzzled me .
There was a writer who spelled “ annihilate ” with just one “ n . ”
And he used it in every other sentence .
This was back in the days before word processors , when I was in the collating department and had to prepare handwritten Reader ’s proofs for the printer .
I must have written the word “ annihilate ” four hundred times .
The writer never did notice that it had two “ n ”s .
One stubborn editor refused to believe that “ arrhythmia ” was spelled with two “ r ”s .
This does n’t come up often , but it is odd to have someone simply refuse to spell a word right because he thinks it looks funny .
It ’s almost admirable .
The difference between “ lie ” and “ lay ” in the past tense continues to confound .
It is “ lie , lay , lain ” ( intransitive verb , meaning “ to recline ” ) and “ lay , laid , laid ” ( transitive verb , meaning “ to set [ something ] down ” ) .
“ Laid ” is so often used incorrectly as the past tense of “ lie ” ( as in “ She laid down for a nap ” [ ding , ding , ding : wrong ! ] ) that people are afraid to use it even when it ’s right , so you ’ll get a sentence like “ She lay the stones on the grave . ”
It does n’t set off so many bells , but it ’s a mistake , in this case attributable to overcorrectness .
Andy : Mary , this has been fascinating .
You expand this into a 50,000 word piece , and I can sell it to Knopf .
Final note :
After completing this interview , I sent the text to Mary .
She sent it back , hurling me into copy edit hell .
I spent 3 hours correcting her edits that included caps to lower case , lower case to caps , spaces between periods and colons , assorted italics and the list goes on .
This exercise was a powerful lesson , in itself , in the work of a copy editor .
I ’m exhausted from the experience .

‘ Conservative ’ Alabama mayor blasts BP ’s ‘ ineptitude ’ and ‘ total malfunction ’ of Coast Guard response
During the two months since BP ’s Deepwater Horizon oil well blew out , a tide of oil has been advancing inexorably on the Gulf Coast , like a slow - motion tsunami .
“ When we know the oil is coming at specific places on the American coast , can we stop it ? ” MSNBC ’s Rachel Maddow wondered on Thursday .
“ We should be able to , but apparently we can ’t .
At least we ca n’t in Alabama , in Orange Beach , where locals have been watching the oil offshore for weeks . ”

Maddow spoke with the major of Orange Beach , Tony Kennon , who noted , “ I ’m a conservative , ” but went on to insist , “ The Republican senator that said this was n’t an environmental disaster was a complete fool .
He needs to come down and take a swim off Louisiana ’s coast , if it ’s not a disaster . ”
Kennon was referring to Alaska Representative Don Young , who argued for a continuation of offshore drilling in late May on the grounds that “ this is not an environmental disaster and I will say that again and again because it is a natural phenomenon . ”
On Wednesday , Associated Press reporter Rich Matthews actually did take a swim in the oil - fouled waters , reporting that “ dropping beneath the surface the only thing I see is oil .
To the left , right , up and down Ã¢â‚¬â€  it sits on top of the water in giant pools , and hangs suspended fifteen feet beneath the surface . ”
Kennon was unsparing in his criticism of both BP and the US government .
“ The oil moved in Tuesday evening , ” he told Maddow .
“ I thought we had closed the pass down — the pass is the opening between the Gulf of Mexico and our back bays .
At ten o’clock that night , the Coast Guard let me know that they were not going to close down the pass .
…
Between that decision and the ineptitude of the response by BP ’s contractor and plan , oil moved up three to four miles into our back bays . ”
“ But there was also a component of disorganization and total malfunction , ” continued Kennon , “ where they continued to open and close the gates for boats to come in and out … which allowed the oil to move out of the containment area into the back bays .
Which is absolutely mind - boggling to me . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
Maddow noted that technology exists for containing the oil “ but apparently we , the United States of America , do not have the will or the coordination or the manpower or the leadership to pull something like this off .
…
We are doing a disgracefully bad job keeping that oil offshore and getting it out of the water . ”
Kennon agreed with her , emphasizing that “ unfortunately , locals , we have absolutely zero control over the process and what ’s going on .
That is completely within BP ’s purview .
..
Two to three weeks ago , I began to start yelling at a fairly high volume that we did n’t have enough assets in place to do the job . ”
“ Booming is a very simplistic approach to blocking the oil , ” the mayor explained .
“ And when you have a simplistic approach , you make up with overwhelming numbers of assets .
But when you ’ve got a simplistic approach and underwhelming numbers , that ’s when you get into trouble . ”

According to a local news story in the Press - Register , a BP representative assured the residents of Orange Beach this week “ that a multimilion - dollar plan to keep oil out of the pass with a mechanical system is in the works , but that it may be three weeks before it ’s operable . ”

Patrik Elias was n't happy to see the Devils lose defenseman Paul Martin to free agency , but he has a suggestion on how to fill that hole .
Tomas Kaberle .
Elias would like to see the Devils trade for the Toronto Maple Leafs defenseman .
" Personally , I would n't be the only one to love to play with that guy , " Elias said .
" I 've played with him on the ( Czech ) national team .
He 's just tremendous .
It 's unbelievable how he can control the game .
He contributes offensively .
" I think he'd be a wonderful addition to our team .
Toronto's been talking for three years that they want to trade him .
Whatever team gets him , it will be a great addition . "
In passing , Elias also said he would n't mind seeing former linemate Petr Sykora invited for a tryout at some point .
Elias , Sykora and Jason Arnott once formed the Devils ' A Line .
" He should get a tryout .
He needs to get healthy first , " Elias said of Sykora , who underwent groin surgery this past spring .
Elias recently had dinner with Arnott in Hoboken .
The big center was acquired in a trade with the Nashville Predators .
" He 's excited to be back in this organization , " Elias said .
" With his presence -- a big body and a big shot -- I hope he 's going to be a help to us . "
Elias was at the Prudential Center working out today .
He watched Travis Zajac take some power skating lessons .
This summer Elias has remained in New Jersey because his wife , Petra , is pregnant and due in November .
He watched the World Cup , has followed the NHL free agency market and was surprised to see Martin sign with the Penguins .
" I thought he would go to the West Coast somewhere , " Elias said .
" Who knows if he was getting offers from other teams ?
He felt like Pittsburgh is a great team and a good fit for him .
" You do n't want to see your top man going to your rival .
They ( the Pens ) lost a big man in ( Sergei ) Gonchar . "
General manager Lou Lamoriello says he still has a few trades in mind .
One could be for Kaberle .
" I 'm not sure .
I think a lot will be decided by whatever is going to happen with Kovy ( Ilya Kovalchuk ) , " Elias suggested .
" If he 's going to be here or he's not going to be here , either way there might be some reason for moves .
The ( salary ) cap plays a role in that . "
Elias spoke of the need for teams to have a puck - moving defenseman and pointed out that the Devils have lost three in recent years .
" Losing Paul and losing Rafi ( Brian Rafalski ) and Nieder ( Scott Niedermayer ) years back , " he said .
" ( Henrik )
Tallinder is used to playing on the first defensive unit a little bit , the first pair .
He 's a guy who controls games and the puck .
" Andy Greene did a great job last year .
He stepped it up big time and I think proved to himself that he could do that to a certain extent .
He 'll get better , no question about it , as years go on .
It was great to see .
Everybody saw the potential in him and he 's been steady for the last couple of years , but I 'd still like to see maybe one of the top guys here .
" But who is out there ?
Lou knows best what we need , but sometimes it 's not easy to fill those roles .
You understand that . "
Elias hated to see Martin leave .
" He 's not a flashy guy because of his style .
He 's tall and kind of awkward looking on the ice , not skating smoothly or flashy and not scoring a lot of goals , " Elias said .
" But I love playing with him .
He understands the game so well .
If you talk to him about different plays , he gets it right away .
" Defensively he was tremendous , even though he does n't hit and does n't run around .
He played a lot of minutes and played against top guys all the time .
You do n't have to run around and play overly physical to be effective . "
* * *
Elias weighed in on the Ilya Kovalchuk free agency watch .
" Obviously he 's taking his time , " Elias said .
" Maybe he is showing a new trend for upcoming years .
Why not take a little time and figure out what is the right team if you are in that position ?
I do n't know if you want to drag it out for this long .
" When you go into free agency you should have an idea of what you want , where you want to go , the pros and cons on each team .
That should make it an easy decision .
But I can speak for my experience .
It just happened so quick .
It was a very stressful situation .
Sometimes you wish you 'd take more time and think it over .
Make sure you 're doing everything right .
I 'm happy , obviously , with my decision . "
It does n't seem like Kovalchuk wants to stay in New Jersey .
" It 's his choice .
It 's his right , " Elias said .
" Who knows ?
Only he knows the reasons why he has n't signed anywhere yet .
You can't really judge anybody unless you know everything that 's going on .
He 'll make his decision when it 's right for him .
Sometimes it 's not just hockey reasons .
" I stayed here four years ago because we were winning and we always have a chance to play in the playoffs . "
He has n't spoken to Kovalchuk .
" I texted him a couple of days ago , " he said .
" But no response .
I think he 's getting a lot of those .
I just said I heard he was coming back and I hoped it was true . "

Elias said he has been playing tennis 3 - 4 times a week and biking a lot .
He may start skating in the next couple of weeks .
He recalled his first scrimmage as a Devils rookie , playing on a line with John MacLean .
" I played left wing with Neal Broten an Johnny Mac , " Elias said with a smile .

MYTH : It Does n't Matter Where You Sit
" One seat is as safe as the other . " - Boeing Web site
" It 's an age - old question .
There 's just no way to say . "
- Federal Aviation Administration spokesman
" There is no safest seat . " - airsafe.com
REALITY : It 's Safer In the Back .
The funny thing about all those expert opinions :
They 're not really based on hard data about actual airline accidents .
A look at real - world crash stats , however , suggests that the farther back you sit , the better your odds of survival .
Passengers near the tail of a plane are about 40 percent more likely to survive a crash than those in the first few rows up front .
That 's the conclusion of an exclusive Popular Mechanics study that examined every commercial jet crash in the United States , since 1971 , that had both fatalities and survivors .
The raw data from these 20 accidents has been languishing for decades in National Transportation Safety Board files , waiting to be analyzed by anyone curious enough to look and willing to do the statistical drudgework .
And drudgework it was .
For several weeks , we pored over reports filed by NTSB crash investigators , and studied seating charts that showed where each passenger sat and whether they lived or died .
We then calculated the average fore - and - aft seating position of both survivors and fatalities for each crash .
We also compared survival rates in four sections of the aircraft .
Both analytical approaches clearly pointed to the same conclusion :
It 's safer in the back .
In 11 of the 20 crashes , rear passengers clearly fared better .
Only five accidents favored those sitting forward .
Three were tossups , with no particular pattern of survival .
In one case , seat positions could not be determined .
In seven of the 11 crashes favoring back - seaters , their advantage was striking .
For example , in both the 1982 Air Florida accident in Washington , D.C. , and the 1972 crash of an Eastern 727 at New York 's Kennedy Airport , the handful of survivors were all sitting in the last few rows .
And when a United DC - 8 ran out of fuel near Portland , Ore. , in 1978 , all seven passengers who died were sitting in the first four rows .
Oddly , the five accidents that favored front - cabin passengers all occurred between 1988 and 1992 .
In the 1989 United DC - 10 accident in Sioux City , Iowa , for example , the majority of the 175 survivors sat ahead of the wing .
There was just one crash in which passengers in the front had a pronounced survival advantage .
The only two fatalities in a 1989 USAir runway accident at LaGuardia were both sitting in Row 21 in the 25 - row Boeing 737-400 .
Where detailed seating charts were available , we also calculated survival rates for various parts of the passenger cabin .
Again , the trend was clear :
The rear cabin ( seats located behind the trailing edge of the wing ) had the highest average survival rate at 69 percent .
The overwing section had a 56 percent survival rate , as did the coach section ahead of the wing .
First / business - class sections ( or in all - coach planes , the front 15 percent ) had an average survival rate of just 49 percent .
So when the " experts " tell you it does n't matter where you sit , have a chuckle and head for the back of the plane .
And once your seatbelt is firmly fastened , relax :
There 's been only one fatal jet crash in the U.S. in the last five - plus years .

Whenever one of my college friends comes back into town , I love to call everyone from the old crew to go out and get some drinks .
One of these friends , who we ’ll call “ Sergey ” always responds enthusiastically by saying “ yea man …
I would love to meet up with you guys .
I just have to do a few things and then I ’ll give you a call ! ”
Nine times out of ten , Sergey never shows up .
On the times when he does n’t show up , he does n’t even send a text or call to let us know that he ’s not coming .
Admittedly , I feel a bit let down .
I ’ve told Sergey that it would be nice if he would just shoot me a text telling me that he ca n’t make it .
I understand he ’s busy and has obligations but I think it ’s common courtesy to let someone know you ca n’t make it if you say you will .
Earlier today , I was reading my typical RSS articles .
I read Seth Godin ’s latest article A Hierarchy of Failure Worth Following .
It ’s small enough , I ’m going to include the whole text :
Not all failures are the same .
Here are five kinds , from frequency = good all the way to please - do n’t !
FAIL OFTEN : Ideas that challenge the status quo .
Proposals .
Brainstorms .
Concepts that open doors .
FAIL FREQUENTLY : Prototypes .
Spreadsheets .
Sample ads and copy .
FAIL OCCASIONALLY : Working mockups .
Playtesting sessions .
Board meetings .
FAIL RARELY : Interactions with small groups of actual users and customers .
FAIL NEVER : Keeping promises to your constituents .
The thing is , in their rush to play it safe and then their urgency to salvage everything in the face of an emergency , most organizations do precisely the opposite .
They throw their customers or their people under the bus ( “ we had no choice ” ) but rarely take the pro-active steps necessary to fail quietly , and often , in private , in advance , when there ’s still time to make things better .
Better to have a difficult conversation now than a failed customer interaction later .
After the the “ Fail Never ” line , I started thinking about one of my clients .
After the last line , I got some knots in my stomach .
You see , I ’ve been a software consultant / contractor for about four years .
I ’ve been working with a trucking company to develop software to manage / schedule their fleet since I started consulting .
I “ finished ” the software about two years ago .
They ’ve called me from time to time to do some small updates .
About three months ago I got a call from them asking me to do some other updates .
I visited their office and discovered that they did n’t really use the software much , and when they tried , it did n’t work as expected .
It would crash , the UI would lock up , and it was generally buggy .
I made a ton of mistakes :
I made a custom ORM around PostgreSQL .
At the time , I did n’t even know what an ORM was , I just thought it made sense to wrap up the database layer into nice pretty classes .
I was n’t too familiar with design patterns or unit testing .
My strategy was basic drag & drop using Windows Forms and C#. I mixed business logic and UI programming .
I even put blocking networking code in the UI thread !
My major strength was that I had a great grasp on simplicity and UI design .
The app itself looked great .
But , you can polish a turd and it ’s still a turd .
Regardless though , this was n’t even my major weakness .
As a developer ( or as an optimist ? ) , I frequently give clients optimistic time lines for completion of projects .
This time was no exception .
“ Yea , we ’ll come out at the end of a next week and show you the updates . ” I said .
When I opened up the code and looked at it again , I knew I was in trouble .
What the fuck was I thinking years ago when I wrote this ?
I worked diligently .
The end of the next week came .
I still was n’t done .
Not even close .
Try making small changes to your data model on your crappy custom ORM .
It sucks .
I really wanted to rewrite everything , the whole entire app .
But , I knew that would lessen my chance for success , as most of the functionality works .
I knew that was a bad idea .
The week passed .
I did n’t call them .
It ’s not like I blew them off , as we did n’t have a time scheduled , just a “ end of next week ” time .
The following week passed without me contacting them .
After reading that last line , I knew I had messed up .
Better to have a difficult conversation now , instead of a failed customer interaction later .
- Seth Godin
Do n’t forget this .
Seriously .
I called them almost immediately after I read that line .
I knew I needed to tell them that I ’m still working on making it work well and that I did n’t forget about them .
They were very grateful that I had called and were willing to wait longer .
When it comes down to it , they could have picked anyone else , but they picked me .
I should not take that for granted .
Much like I was let down when my friend Sergey would n’t let me know that he was n’t going to make it , I let my client down .
That ’s bad business .
I wo n’t ever end my friendship with Sergey because I enjoy hanging out with him as we ’ve been friends for about 15 years , but the truck company could ’ve ended their relationship with me years ago .
But the real lesson is that business is about relationships .
Each business interaction should be treated as such .
If you can manage your business relationships in a uniquely positive manner , you ’ll be successful .
So many companies out their treat their customers like shit .
Do n’t be this company .
Use the Golden Rule on this one and your customers will love you for it .

The Missing Link ( a.ka . Dewey Robertson ) was a menace to any opponent that dare cross him in the four - sided ring .
His green face paint , chaotic hair and animalistic violence is a salient memory from my impressionable youth .
I would be glued to the screen and speechless whenever he ’d make an appearance during a pro wrestling program .
My mother initially forbade me watching these unruly brutes in action .
The hyperbolic characters and melodrama , however , were too captivating for me to obey the ban .
My mom was slowly forced to accept my viewing choice and a lifetime fascination was born .
My father would often point out that what I watching was fake .
I was four and really kind of insulted that he thought I did n’t know .
That a man could be thrown on his head and get back up without a serious injury seemed to clarify my dad ’s argument all on it ’s own for me .
In fact , this phenomenon my dad wanted unveiled is what kept me hypnotized by the matches .
I was content to believe and suspend rational thought .
You know –like kids do ?
But we are not here to talk about my father .
The point being that ignoring the rational turned these epic , angry , men into superheroes and again made them completely fascinating .
Another character I was engrossed with was Bret the Hitman Heart .
I recently read his autobiography , Hitman : My Life in the Cartoon World of Wrestling .
The book is riddled with many fascinating points , stories and anecdotes .
One passage in particular , however , really struck a chord in me : “ Most of the boys got to comparing Ultimate Fighters to pro wrestlers .
The UFC guys pounded each other ’s face and snapped limbs for real , all for a measly $ 50,000 grand prize .
I was proud that wrestling was a work ” ( Hart 338 ) .
I guess in my heart , I ’m a pacifist and do n’t want to see anyone really get hurt . . . definitely not intentionally .
Wrestling is really more complex than it seems .
I ’d never been to a live wrestling match , but a few decades later and a few weekends ago , my siblings and I were awestruck to attend a live match .
It was a small show , but had a lot of what I enjoyed as a child ; the theatrics , the smack - talking , the heroes and my favorite –the villains .
What ’s more , I was privileged to document the event as well as work with the wrestlers for some improv portraits .
It ’s the little things in life that make it rich , but this experience was pretty major for us .
We had a blast !
I ca n’t wait til’ the next match .
Who knows . . . my siblings and I may even work a few matches eventually !

These are hard times for newspapers , and not just the Times .
America ’s other iconic daily of the past half - century , the Washington Post , has been doing a long , slow fade , speeded up lately by the Great Recession .
The Post ’s weekday circulation is barely two - thirds what it was in the nineteen - nineties .
During the most recently measured six - month period alone , sales of the weekday paper plummeted thirteen per cent .
Repeated buyouts have decimated the staff .
Last year , the Post closed its remaining domestic bureaus , in Chicago , Los Angeles , and New York .
Its stock price today is less than half what it was in 2004 .
Kaplan , the for - profit education outfit the Post acquired in 1984 , now provides some sixty per cent of its income .
A glum , decade - old newsroom wisecrack — that the Post is a test - prep tutoring service that puts out a newspaper as a hobby — got glummer in 2007 , when the Washington Post Company officially declared itself an “ education and media company , ” no joke .
Illustration by Tom Bachtell
All the more reason , then , to ladle on the praise when the Post shows that it can still produce the kind of public - spirited , enterprising journalism that is essential to the health of a free society .
Last week , in a series of three articles totalling some thirteen thousand words , the paper explored the immense national - security industry created since 9/11 — a bureaucratic behemoth , substantially privatized but awash in public money , that “ has become so large , so unwieldy , and so secretive ” that it “ amounts to an alternative geography of the United States , a Top Secret America hidden from public view and lacking in thorough oversight . ”
Mimicking , consciously or not , the work product of its subject , the series begins by summarizing itself with a PowerPoint - like set of bullet points :
Some 1,271 government organizations and 1,931 private companies work on programs related to counterterrorism , homeland security and intelligence in about 10,000 locations across the United States .
An estimated 854,000 people , nearly 1.5 times as many people as live in Washington , D.C. , hold top - secret security clearances .
In Washington and the surrounding area , 33 building complexes for top - secret intelligence work are under construction or have been built since September 2001 .
Together they occupy the equivalent of almost three Pentagons or 22 U.S. Capitol buildings — about 17 million square feet of space .
Many security and intelligence agencies do the same work , creating redundancy and waste .
For example , 51 federal organizations and military commands , operating in 15 U.S. cities , track the flow of money to and from terrorist networks .
Analysts who make sense of documents and conversations obtained by foreign and domestic spying share their judgment by publishing 50,000 intelligence reports each year — a volume so large that many are routinely ignored .
Beyond the numbing numbers , the Post describes a vast archipelago of gleaming new office parks , concentrated in the Washington suburbs but also scattered throughout the country , protected by high fences and armed security guards , bland - looking but inaccessible , and filled with command centers , internal television networks , video walls , armored S.U.V.s , and inner sanctums called SCIFs , short for “ sensitive compartmented information facilities . ”
How much of this — “ the bling of national security , ” the Post calls it — is necessary or even useful may be doubted , but it is undeniably expensive .
Much of it is there because the taxpayer cash to buy it is there — an unending , ever - growing , BP - worthy fiscal blowout that , beginning just after 9/11 and continuing to this day , flooded the agencies with “ more money than they were capable of responsibly spending , ” the Post writes .
“ They ’ve got the penis envy thing going , ” a contractor whose business specializes in building SCIFs says .
“ You ca n’t be a big boy unless you ’re a three - letter agency and you have a big SCIF . ”
Moreover , fully a quarter - million holders of top - secret security clearances are employees not of the government but of private , profit - making businesses .
Government agencies serve as a hiring hall for contractor corporations offering perks and salaries the agencies can’t match , leaving them to rely on recent graduates whose familiarity with the countries they analyze , including their languages , is minimal .
The concern this raises — a concern that Robert M. Gates , the Secretary of Defense , and Leon Panetta , the head of the C.I.A. , told the paper they share — is “ whether the federal workforce includes too many people obligated to shareholders rather than the public interest — and whether the government is still in control of its most sensitive activities . ”
An intelligence community hobbled , as the Post shows , by a toxic mixture of secrecy , compartmentalization , turf rivalry , and tremendous duplication of effort is further bedevilled by a problem familiar to every computer addict : too much information .
Every day , for example , the National Security Agency alone intercepts and stores nearly two billion separate e-mails , phone calls , and other communications .
By the time the gusher reaches officials charged with making policy , it ’s still a fire hose .
“ The complexity of this system defies description , ” John R. Vines , a retired Army general who reviewed the Defense Department ’s slice of it last year , told the Post .
“ Because it lacks a synchronizing process , it inevitably results in message dissonance , reduced effectiveness , and waste .
We consequently ca n’t effectively assess whether it is making us more safe . ”
The story the Post tells is not about criminal conspiracies or rogue elements or corruption in the usual sense .
No one ’s dedication to the cause of protecting America is questioned .
The tale has no villains — unless you count the pathologies of secrecy and bureaucracy and the panicky bravado that led the White House , Congress , and the public to frame the response to Al Qaeda as an essentially unlimited War on Terror .
It is an exposé about a secret world , but it exposes no secrets .
Interviewees who asked for anonymity did so not in order to “ leak ” — to reveal classified information — but to express judgments that their bosses and colleagues might hold against them .
Virtually all the data that the paper collected in the two years it took to prepare the series was already in the public record .
And the bulk of the public record is no longer to be found in library stacks , dusty courthouse files , and microfilm rolls .
Just as its subject is a new kind of bureaucratic enterprise , “ Top Secret America ” is a new kind of journalistic enterprise , pairing expert reporting of the traditional shoe - leather variety with the information - gathering power of the Internet .
One of the series ’ lead writers , Dana Priest , is a winner of two well - deserved Pulitzer Prizes , for her stories on abuses at Walter Reed and the C.I.A. ’s overseas “ black sites . ”
The other , William M. Arkin , is that despised creature , a blogger — or was until he put aside the national - security blog that he conducted on the Post ’s Web site to begin his collaboration with Priest .
While she worked the phones and racked up the miles , he sat in his converted barn in Vermont , surfing oceans of data .
The result is a portrait of a problem .
Laying it all out is a start .
Reining it all in will be harder . ♦

The argument that the New York Times has been pushing that children who throw stones at occupying Israeli soldiers are important evidence of the violence of the Palestinian protests ( rather than impulsive angry resistance ) is echoed ( what a surprise ) by a new Israeli term : " popular terror , " to label these bad children who throw stones .
Journalist Didi Remez picks up the Maariv story on the IDF ’s use of dogs against these kids as a " non-lethal " option .
" Disturbances have increased throughout Judea and Samaria in recent months , " says Maariv ; thus the IDF will turn to the " Oketz dog . "
Oketz is an army unit , with the charmingly choppy resonance of totalitarian names across Europe back in the day .
I tell you : this is a society in deep spiritual crisis , now in an apartheid struggle , no longer on the verge of one .
But expect the U.S. press to catch up to this story in 3 years , when it is too late to avert worse bloodshed .
This post will look at how Neighbor Discovery works in IPv6 .
The topology is shown below :
First we will configure the MAC address of each router ’s interface to 0000.0000.XXXX where X is the router number in order to make EUI - 64 format addresses easier to work with :
R1 :
interface FastEthernet0/0
mac- address 0000.0000.1111
R2 :
interface FastEthernet0/0
mac- address 0000.0000.2222
R3 :
interface FastEthernet0/0
mac- address 0000.0000.3333
Next we will configure a global unicast address on R1 :
R1 :
interface FastEthernet0/0
ipv6 address 2001:123::1/64
R1 assigns itself the configured address as well as a link - local address using the EUI - 64 format :
We can see the sequence of events that takes place when the address configuration command is entered using debug ip v6 nd :
R1 # debug ip v6 nd
* Mar 1 00:48:09.683 : ICMPv6 - ND : Adding prefix 2001:123::1/64 to FastEthernet0/0
* Mar 1 00:48:10.683 : ICMPv6 - ND : Sending NS for FE80::200 : FF : FE00:1111 on FastEthernet0/0
* Mar 1 00:48:11.683 : ICMPv6-ND : DAD : FE80::200 : FF : FE00:1111 is unique .
* Mar 1 00:48:11.683 : ICMPv6 - ND : Sending NA for FE80::200 : FF : FE00:1111 on FastEthernet0/0
* Mar 1 00:48:11.683 : ICMPv6 - ND : Address FE80::200 : FF : FE00:1111/10 is up on FastEthernet0/0
* Mar 1 00:48:11.691 : ICMPv6 - ND : Sending NS for 2001:123::1 on FastEthernet0/0
* Mar 1 00:48:12.691 : ICMPv6-ND : DAD : 2001:123::1 is unique .
* Mar 1 00:48:12.691 : ICMPv6 - ND : Sending NA for 2001:123::1 on FastEthernet0/0
* Mar 1 00:48:12.691 : ICMPv6 - ND : Address 2001:123::1/64 is up on FastEthernet0/0
We will examine this process step by step in a moment when we configure R2 to act as a host on the network .
For now , we will configure R1 to act as a router on the network :
R1 :
ipv6 unicast - routing
After entering this , we can see that several new lines appear at the bottom of the show ip v6 interface output :
This information relates to the sending of Router Advertisement ( RA ) messages by R1 .
As soon as ip v6 unicast - routing is configured , R1 begins sending unsolicited RA messages approximately every 200 seconds :
R1 # debug ip v6 nd
* Mar 1 00:55:55.031 : ICMPv6 - ND : Sending RA to FF02::1 on FastEthernet0/0
* Mar 1 00:55:55.031 : ICMPv6-ND : MTU = 1500
* Mar 1 00:55:55.035 : ICMPv6 - ND : prefix = 2001:123::/64 onlink autoconfig
* Mar 1 00:55:55.035 : ICMPv6-ND : 2592000/604800 ( valid / preferred )
These RAs are sourced from R1 ’s link local address and sent to the all IP v6 nodes multicast group :
The ICMPv6 Type value identifies the message as an RA .
There are several other pieces of information within the RA that could be important to hosts on the link .
The main one we are interested in right now is the first flag bit , which has not been set .
This tells hosts they should attempt to use stateless autoconfiguration to obtain their IP v6 addresses .
We can also see that 3 optional TLVs have been included in the RA message in order to tell hosts on the link about the router ’s MAC address , the MTU of the link , and the global prefix used on the link :
Next , let ’s configure R2 to automatically obtain an IPv6 address through stateless autoconfiguration :
R2 :
interface FastEthernet0/0
ipv6 address autoconfig
A similar sequence of events takes place on R2 after entering the address command to what we saw earlier on R1 :
R2 #debug ip v6 nd
* Mar 1 01:45:52.175 : ICMPv6 - ND : Sending NS for FE80::200: FF : FE00:2222 on FastEthernet0/0
* Mar 1 01:45:53.175 : ICMPv6-ND : DAD : FE80::200 : FF : FE00:2222 is unique .
* Mar 1 01:45:53.175 : ICMPv6 - ND : Sending NA for FE80::200: FF : FE00:2222 on FastEthernet0/0
* Mar 1 01:45:53.175 : ICMPv6 - ND : Address FE80::200: FF : FE00:2222/10 is up on FastEthernet0/0
* Mar 1 01:45:55.179 : ICMPv6 - ND : Sending RS on FastEthernet0/0
* Mar 1 01:45:55.199 : ICMPv6 - ND : Received RA from FE80::200 : FF : FE00:1111 on FastEthernet0/0
* Mar 1 01:45:55.203 : ICMPv6-ND : DELETE -> INCMP : FE80::200: FF : FE00:1111
* Mar 1 01:45:55.203 : ICMPv6-ND : INCMP -> STALE : FE80::200: FF : FE00:1111
* Mar 1 01:45:55.207 : ICMPv6 - ND : Sending NS for 2001:123::200: FF : FE00:2222 on FastEthernet0/0
* Mar 1 01:45:55.207 : ICMPv6-ND : Autoconfiguring 2001:123::200: FF : FE00:2222 on FastEthernet0/0
* Mar 1 01:45:56.207 : ICMPv6-ND : DAD : 2001:123::200: FF : FE00:2222 is unique .
* Mar 1 01:45:56.207 : ICMPv6 - ND : Sending NA for 2001:123::200: FF : FE00:2222 on FastEthernet0/0
* Mar 1 01:45:56.211 : ICMPv6 - ND : Address 2001:123::200: FF : FE00:2222/64 is up on FastEthernet0/0
Let ’s look at this process step by step .
After telling R2 to use autoconfiguration to obtain an address , R2 first calculates it ’s EUI - 64 interface ID on F0/0 from it ’s MAC address and appends this to the link local prefix ( FE80::/10 ) .
R2 marks this address as tentative ( shown as ‘ TEN ’ ) and sends a neighbor solicitation ( NS ) message to this address to verify that it is n’t a duplicate before R2 starts to use it :
* Mar 1 01:45:52.175 : ICMPv6 - ND : Sending NS for FE80::200: FF : FE00:2222 on FastEthernet0/0
The NS message is sourced from an unspecified IP v6 address ( : :) since R2 does not have a valid IP v6 address yet and is sent to the solicited node multicast group for the tentative address ( FF02::1:FF00:2222 ) .
Any node with an address that ended in the same 24 bits would be required to join this group and would hear the NS message .
The node would then examine the target address contained within the NS to see if the full address matched it ’s own or not , and if it did would prevent R2 from using it .
Since no other nodes are using this address , R2 does not get a reply back .
After waiting 1 second without a reply , R2 determines that the address must be unique :
* Mar 1 01:45:53.175 : ICMPv6-ND : DAD : FE80::200 : FF : FE00:2222 is unique .
At the same time R2 begins using the address and removes the tentative marker from it .
R2 also sends an unsolicited neighbor advertisement ( NA ) to advertise it ’s new link - local address :
* Mar 1 01:45:53.175 : ICMPv6 - ND : Sending NA for FE80::200: FF : FE00:2222 on FastEthernet0/0
* Mar 1 01:45:53.175 : ICMPv6 - ND : Address FE80::200: FF : FE00:2222/10 is up on FastEthernet0/0
The source address is set to R2’s link local address and the destination address is the all IP v6 nodes multicast address .
The target address is set to R2’s link local so other nodes know which address the advertisement is for , and the NA message includes an option TLV to specify R2 ’s MAC address .
The override flag has also been set , telling receivers that this information should override the information in their neighbor cache for this entry .
After a couple seconds , R2 sends a router solicitation ( RS ) to request that any routers on the link send an RA :
* Mar 1 01:45:55.179 : ICMPv6 - ND : Sending RS on FastEthernet0/0
R2 uses it ’s link - local address as the source and the all routers IP v6 multicast address as the destination .
R2 also includes it ’s MAC address as an option TLV :
R1 receives the RS and sends a solicited RA in response rather than waiting up to 200 seconds for it ’s next unsolicited RA .
Some sources say that this is unicast to the IP v6 address of the node that sent the RS , but my tests showed that the destination address ( FF02::1 ) and every other part of the packet was identical to an unsolicted RA .
R2 receives the RA from R1 a few milliseconds after sending it ’s RS :
* Mar 1 01:45:55.199 : ICMPv6 - ND : Received RA from FE80::200 : FF : FE00:1111 on FastEthernet0/0
The next two debug messages relate to the neighbor cache , which we will ignore for now .
R2 learns R1 ’s link - local address and adds it as a default router .
R2 also learns the link prefix from the received RA and prepends it to it ’s EUI - 64 interface ID .
Just like with the link - local address , R2 marks the address as tentative and sends an NS as part of the Duplicate Address Detection procedure :
* Mar 1 01:45:55.207 : ICMPv6 - ND : Sending NS for 2001:123::200: FF : FE00:2222 on FastEthernet0/0
* Mar 1 01:45:55.207 : ICMPv6-ND : Autoconfiguring 2001:123::200: FF : FE00:2222 on FastEthernet0/0
The NS packet is identical to the one shown earlier , other than the target address now being set to R2 ’s tentative global unicast address instead of the link - local address .
When no reply for the address comes back after 1 second , R2 determines that this address is also unique :
* Mar 1 01:45:56.207 : ICMPv6-ND : DAD : 2001:123::200: FF : FE00:2222 is unique .
R2 then sends an unsolicited NA to advertise it ’s new address .
The NA is identical to the one that R2 sent for it ’s link - local address earlier other than the source IPv6 address and target address in the ICMPv6 option being set to R2 ’s global unicast address instead of the link - local address :
* Mar 1 01:45:56.207 : ICMPv6 - ND : Sending NA for 2001:123::200: FF : FE00:2222 on FastEthernet0/0
Finally , R2 is able to remove the tentative marking on the address :
* Mar 1 01:45:56.211 : ICMPv6 - ND : Address 2001:123::200: FF : FE00:2222/64 is up on FastEthernet0/0
If multiple prefixes are configured on the link , R1 includes an additional TLV in it ’s RA messages for each prefix :
R1 :
interface FastEthernet0/0
ipv6 address 3001:123::1/64
R1 # debug ip v6 nd
* Mar 1 01:31:19.691 : ICMPv6 - ND : Sending RA to FF02::1 on FastEthernet0/0
* Mar 1 01:31:19.691 : ICMPv6-ND : MTU = 1500
* Mar 1 01:31:19.691 : ICMPv6 - ND : prefix = 2001:123::/64 onlink autoconfig
* Mar 1 01:31:19.691 : ICMPv6-ND : 2592000/604800 ( valid / preferred )
* Mar 1 01:31:19.695 : ICMPv6 - ND : prefix = 3001:123::/64 onlink autoconfig
* Mar 1 01:31:19.695 : ICMPv6-ND : 2592000/604800 ( valid / preferred )
R2 goes through the same process detailed above for the new prefix and configures itself a global address using that prefix as well :
If another node on the link attempts to use the same IP v6 address , Duplicate Address Detection prevents this from happening .
Before testing this out , first we will get rid of the additional prefix that we created :
R1 :
interface FastEthernet0/0
no ip v6 address 3001:123::1/64
R2 :
interface FastEthernet0/0
no ip v6 address autoconfig
A few seconds later …
R2 :
interface FastEthernet0/0
ipv6 address autoconfig
Next we will configure R3 to use the same MAC address as R2 and to obtain an IPv6 address through stateless autoconfiguration :
R3 :
interface FastEthernet0/0
mac- address 0000.0000.2222
ipv6 address autoconfig
R3 #debug ip v6 nd
* Mar 1 01:48:21.775 : ICMPv6 - ND : Sending NS for FE80::200: FF : FE00:2222 on FastEthernet0/0
* Mar 1 01:48:21.907 : ICMPv6 - ND : Received NA for FE80::200: FF : FE00:2222 on FastEthernet0/0 from FE80::200: FF : FE00:2222
* Mar 1 01:48:21.915 : ICMPv6-ND : DAD : duplicate link - local FE80::200 : FF : FE00:2222 on FastEthernet0/0 , interface stalled
* Mar 1 01:48:21.915 : %IPV6-4-DUPLICATE : Duplicate address FE80::200: FF : FE00:2222 on FastEthernet0/0
R3 follows the same process shown earlier , calculating it ’s EUI - 64 interface ID and appending the interface ID to the link - local prefix .
R3 then sends a NS for the tentative address that it came up with to the solicited - node multicast group .
Since R2 has joined this group , it receives the NS and finds it ’s own address as the target .
R2 sends an NA immediately to the all nodes multicast address .
R3 receives the NA from R2 before it ’s 1 second DAD timer expires , and R3 realizes the address is a duplicate .
R3 marks the address as a duplicate and does not begin using it :
The MAC address would have to be changed on R3 or a different IP v6 address would have to be manually configured .
Notice also that R3 does not even attempt to assign itself a global address through autoconfiguration until it has a non-duplicate link - local address .
If we change the link - local address used on R3 manually and continue to use stateless autoconfiguration , this not only fixes the duplicate link - local address but also results in R3 assigning itself a non-duplicate global address :
R3 :
interface FastEthernet0/0
ipv6 address FE80::3 link - local
* Mar 1 02:10:27.483 : ICMPv6 - ND : Sending NS for FE80::3 on FastEthernet0/0
* Mar 1 02:10:28.483 : ICMPv6 - ND : DAD : FE80::3 is unique .
* Mar 1 02:10:28.483 : ICMPv6 - ND : Sending NA for FE80::3 on FastEthernet0/0
* Mar 1 02:10:28.483 : ICMPv6 - ND : Address FE80::3/10 is up on FastEthernet0/0
* Mar 1 02:10:30.483 : ICMPv6 - ND : Sending RS on FastEthernet0/0
* Mar 1 02:10:30.523 : ICMPv6 - ND : Received RA from FE80::200 : FF : FE00:1111 on FastEthernet0/0
* Mar 1 02:10:30.523 : ICMPv6-ND : DELETE -> INCMP : FE80::200: FF : FE00:1111
* Mar 1 02:10:30.527 : ICMPv6-ND : INCMP -> STALE : FE80::200: FF : FE00:1111
* Mar 1 02:10:30.527 : ICMPv6 - ND : Sending NS for 2001:123::3 on FastEthernet0/0
* Mar 1 02:10:30.531 : ICMPv6 -ND : Autoconfiguring 2001:123::3 on FastEthernet0/0
* Mar 1 02:10:31.527 : ICMPv6 - ND : DAD : 2001:123::3 is unique .
* Mar 1 02:10:31.527 : ICMPv6 - ND : Sending NA for 2001:123::3 on FastEthernet0/0
* Mar 1 02:10:31.531 : ICMPv6 - ND : Address 2001:123::3/64 is up on FastEthernet0/0
This shows that the interface ID for the link - local address is derived from the MAC address unless manually configured .
The interface ID for a global address , however , is derived from the interface ID used for the link - local address – so if the link - local address has been manually configured , global addresses will use the same interface ID rather than applying the MAC to EUI - 64 conversion to obtain an interface ID .
This applies to interfaces that are manually configured to use EUI - 64 as well :
R3 :
interface FastEthernet0/0
no ip v6 address
A few seconds later …
R3 :
interface FastEthernet0/0
ipv6 address 2001:123::/64 eui-64
* Mar 1 02:26:49.463 : ICMPv6 - ND : Adding prefix
2001:123::200: FF : FE00:2222/64 to FastEthernet0/0
* Mar 1 02:26:50.463 : ICMPv6 - ND : Sending NS for FE80::200: FF : FE00:2222 on FastEthernet0/0
* Mar 1 02:26:50.515 : ICMPv6 - ND : Received NA for FE80::200: FF : FE00:2222 on FastEthernet0/0 from FE80::200: FF : FE00:2222
* Mar 1 02:26:50.523 : ICMPv6-ND : DAD : duplicate link - local FE80::200 : FF : FE00:2222 on FastEthernet0/0 , interface stalled
* Mar 1 02:26:50.523 : %IPV6-4-DUPLICATE : Duplicate address FE80::200: FF : FE00:2222 on FastEthernet0/0
R3 :
interface FastEthernet0/0
ipv6 address FE80::3 link - local
* Mar 1 02:30:37.027 : ICMPv6 - ND : Sending NS for FE80::3 on FastEthernet0/0
* Mar 1 02:30:38.027 : ICMPv6 - ND : DAD : FE80::3 is unique .
* Mar 1 02:30:38.027 : ICMPv6 - ND : Sending NA for FE80::3 on FastEthernet0/0
* Mar 1 02:30:38.027 : ICMPv6 - ND : Address FE80::3/10 is up on FastEthernet0/0
* Mar 1 02:30:38.031 : ICMPv6 - ND : Sending NS for 2001:123::3 on FastEthernet0/0
* Mar 1 02:30:39.031 : ICMPv6 - ND : DAD : 2001:123::3 is unique .
* Mar 1 02:30:39.031 : ICMPv6 - ND : Sending NA for 2001:123::3 on FastEthernet0/0
* Mar 1 02:30:39.031 : ICMPv6 - ND : Address 2001:123::3/64 is up on FastEthernet0/0
Next , we will add a second router to the link .
R1 and R2 will be configured as routers :
R1 :
ipv6 unicast - routing
!
interface FastEthernet0/0
mac- address 0000.0000.1111
ipv6 address 2001:123::1/64
ipv6 address FE80::1 link - local
R2 :
ipv6 unicast - routing
!
interface FastEthernet0/0
mac- address 0000.0000.2222
ipv6 address 2001:123::2/64
ipv6 address FE80::2 link - local
R3 will be configured to use stateless autoconfiguration :
R3 :
interface FastEthernet0/0
mac- address 0000.0000.3333
ipv6 address FE80::3 link - local
ipv6 address autoconfig
When R3 sends out an RS , it receives an RA from both R1 and R2 .
In this case , the RA from R2 arrives a few milliseconds before the RA from R1 :
R3 #debug ip v6 nd
* Mar 1 02:45:26.139 : ICMPv6 - ND : Received RA from FE80::2 on FastEthernet0/0
* Mar 1 02:45:26.147 : ICMPv6 - ND : Received RA from FE80::1 on FastEthernet0/0
What a host does when there are multiple routers is implementation specific ; for a Cisco router acting as a host , it appears that only the first RA received is used as the default router :
Next we will look at how Neighbor Unreachability Detection works .
The Layer - 2 address for IP v6 nodes is stored in the neighbor cache , similar to the ARP cache of IPv4 .
The current neighbor cache of R3 is shown below :
R3 has entries for R1 and R2’s link - local addresses , both in a STALE state .
This means that these addresses were reachable previously , but the Reachable Time has expired since the last confirmation of their reachability .
Let ’s try to ping R1 ’s link - local address on R3 :
R3 #debug ip v6 icmp
R3 #debug ip v6 nd
Mar 1 03:47:37.073 : ICMPv6 : Sending echo request to FE80::1

R3 sends an echo request to R1 immediately , using the Layer - 2 address from the STALE entry in the neighbor cache .
R3 also changes the state of the entry from STALE to DELAY , meaning at least 1 packet has been sent to this address and R3 is now awaiting confirmation of reachability :
R3 :
Mar 1 03:47:37.073 : ICMPv6 : Sending echo request to FE80::1
Mar 1 03:47:37.073 : ICMPv6-ND : STALE -> DELAY : FE80::1
R1 receives the echo request a few milliseconds later and sends an echo reply back , also using the STALE entry that it has in the neighbor cache for R3 .
Sending an echo reply causes the state to change to DELAY since R1 is now awaiting confirmation of reachability :
R1 :
Mar 1 03:47:37.095 : ICMPv6 : Received echo request from FE80::3
Mar 1 03:47:37.095 : ICMPv6 : Sending echo reply to FE80::3
Mar 1 03:47:37.095 : ICMPv6-ND : STALE -> DELAY : FE80::3
R3 receives the echo reply from R1 a few milliseconds later :
R3 :
Mar 1 03:47:37.117 : ICMPv6 : Received echo reply from FE80::1
However , this does not count as a confirmation of reachablity and the cache entry remains in the DELAY state .
The only ways that reachability can be confirmed are :
1. Hints from an upper - layer protocol show that the connection is making forward progress – for example increasing , non-duplicate TCP acknowledgements are received .
2 . A solicited NA is received in response to an NS .
The NA must be solicited because an unsolicited NA would only confirm 1 - way reachability .
Since reachability has not been confirmed , R3 stays in the DELAY state waiting for reachability confirmation for a total of 5 seconds .
After 5 seconds , R3 changes to the PROBE state and actively tries to confirm reachability by sending an NS to the address in question :
R3 :
Mar 1 03:47:42.073 : ICMPv6-ND : DELAY -> PROBE : FE80::1
Mar 1 03:47:42.073 : ICMPv6 -ND : Sending NS for FE80::1 on FastEthernet0/0
R1 ’s 5 second timer expires just a few milliseconds later and it also changes the entry to the PROBE state and sends an NS to R1 ’s address :
R1 :
Mar 1 03:47:42.095 : ICMPv6-ND : DELAY -> PROBE : FE80::3
Mar 1 03:47:42.095 : ICMPv6 -ND : Sending NS for FE80::3 on FastEthernet0/0
R1 receives R3 ’s NS and sends an NA with the solicited flag set :
R1 :
Mar 1 03:47:42.115 : ICMPv6 : Received ICMPv6 packet from FE80::3 , type 135
Mar 1 03:47:42.119 : ICMPv6 -ND : Received NS for FE80::1 on FastEthernet0/0 from FE80::3
Mar 1 03:47:42.119 : ICMPv6 -ND : Sending NA for FE80::1 on FastEthernet0/0
R3 also receives R1 ’s NS and sends an NA with the solicited flag set :
R3 :
Mar 1 03:47:42.169 : ICMPv6 : Received ICMPv6 packet from FE80::1 , type 135
Mar 1 03:47:42.173 : ICMPv6 -ND : Received NS for FE80::3 on FastEthernet0/0 from FE80::1
Mar 1 03:47:42.173 : ICMPv6 -ND : Sending NA for FE80::3 on FastEthernet0/0
R3 receives the solicited NA from R1 .
This confirms 2 - way reachability , so R3 changes the state of the entry to REACH :
R3 :
Mar 1 03:47:42.173 : ICMPv6 : Received ICMPv6 packet from FE80::1 , type 136
Mar 1 03:47:42.173 : ICMPv6 -ND : Received NA for FE80::1 on FastEthernet0/0 from FE80::1
Mar 1 03:47:42.177 : ICMPv6-ND : PROBE -> REACH : FE80::1
Likewise , R1 receives the solicited NA from R3 and now has confirmed 2 - way reachability , so R1 changes the state of the entry to REACH :
R1 :
Mar 1 03:47:42.215 : ICMPv6 : Received ICMPv6 packet from FE80::3 , type 136
Mar 1 03:47:42.215 : ICMPv6 -ND : Received NA for FE80::3 on FastEthernet0/0 from FE80::3
Mar 1 03:47:42.215 : ICMPv6-ND : PROBE -> REACH : FE80::3
After the Reachable Time expires ( 30 seconds by default ) without further 2 - way reachability confirmation , the state of the entry changes back to STALE :
R3 :
Mar 1 03:48:12.179 : ICMPv6-ND : REACH -> STALE : FE80::1
R1 :
Mar 1 03:48:12.215 : ICMPv6-ND : REACH -> STALE : FE80::3
For traffic that does not offer a positive confirmation of 2 - way reachability , this results in each device sending an NS and solicited NA to each other approximately every 35 seconds ( Reachable Time + Delay time ) :

The Reachable Time can be advertised in RAs so that hosts know what value to use .
However , Cisco routers that are acting as hosts do not seem to learn the timer from their default router .
R1 and R2 begin advertising a 10 second Reachable Time in RAs , but R3 continues using 30 seconds :
R1 :
interface FastEthernet0/0
ipv6 nd reachable - time 10000
R2 :
interface FastEthernet0/0
ipv6 nd reachable - time 10000
R3 #ping fe80::1 repeat 1
R1 :
Mar 1 05:04:55.730 : ICMPv6-ND : PROBE -> REACH : FE80::3
Mar 1 05:05:05.730 : ICMPv6-ND : REACH -> STALE : FE80::3
R3 :

Mar 1 05:05:25.647 : ICMPv6-ND : REACH -> STALE : FE80::1
The only way to get R3 to use a non-default Reachable Time is to manually configure it in the same way as R1 and R2 .
Next , let ’s try to ping R1 ’s global unicast address from R3 .
R1 and R3 both start with STALE entries for the link - local addresses of the other 2 devices in their neighbor cache :
The following sequence of events takes place after sending the echo request from R3 :

There are a few differences here compared to when we pinged R1 ’s link - local address .
R3 does not know what Layer - 2 address to use yet for 2001:123::1. R3 creates an incomplete ( INCMP ) entry for the address in the neighbor cache and sends an NS for the address .
When R1 receives the NS , it creates an entry for R3 ’s global address and answers with a solicited NA .
R3 receives the solicited NA which confirms reachability and tells R3 the Layer - 2 address to use .
R3 can now send the echo request to R1 .
R1 does not receive confirmation of 2 - way reachability to R3 ’s global unicast address however , so 5 seconds after sending the NA to R3 , R1 sends an NS for R3 ’s global unicast address sourced from R1 ’s link - local address which starts a chain reaction .
R3 replies to the NS with a solicited NA , which confirms reachability on R1 to R3 ’s global unicast address and causes the entry on R3 for R1 ’s link - local to change to the DELAY state .
After another 5 seconds , R3 sends an NS sourced from it ’s link - local address for R1 ’s link - local address since it has not received reachability confirmation yet .
R1 replies with a solicited NA , confirming reachability for R3 to R1 ’s link - local address and causing R1 to change the state of R3 ’s link - local entry to DELAY .
After 5 seconds , R1 sends an NS for R3 ’s link - local and R3 answers with a solicited NA to confirm reachability .
In total , 4 NS and 4 solicited NA were sent between the 2 devices :
Yet another situation occurs when the devices already have an entry for the address in their neighbor cache .
In this case , R1 and R3 both have an entry for the other ’s global unicast address since it was just pinged :
This time , the following sequence of events occurs :

Mar 1 06:39:24.198 : ICMPv6-ND : REACH -> STALE : FE80::3
This time , R3 does not have to send an NS before it can send the echo request because it already has a STALE entry for R1 ’s global address .
The most interesting difference , however , is in the 2nd and 3rd debug messages shown on R3 :
R3 :
Mar 1 06:38:39.234 : ICMPv6-ND : ULP indication 2001:123::1
Mar 1 06:38:39.234 : ICMPv6-ND : DELAY -> REACH : 2001:123::1
When R3 receives an echo reply from R1 , it considers this to be confirmation of reachability ( shown as ‘ ULP indication ’ ) and immediately changes the entry to the REACH state .
For whatever reason , an echo reply to an echo request from a global unicast address counts as upper - layer protocol confirmation , but an echo reply to an echo request from a link - local address does not ( as we saw earlier ) .
In total 3 NS and 3 solicited NA are sent between the 2 devices :
Next let ’s look at an example of redirects being used as part of NDP in IPv6 .
R3 is still using R2 as it ’s default router , so we will create a loopback on R1 and advertise it to R2 with OSPFv3 :
R1 :
ip v6 router ospf 1
router - id 1.1.1.1
!
interface Loopback0
ipv6 address 2001:1::1/64
ip v6 ospf network point - to - point
ipv6 ospf 1 area 0
!
interface FastEthernet0/0
ipv6 ospf 1 area 0
R2 :
ip v6 router ospf 1
router - id 2.2.2.2
!
interface FastEthernet0/0
ipv6 ospf 1 area 0
R2 now has a route to R1 ’s loopback using R1 ’s link - local as the next hop :
On R3 , we attempt to ping R1 ’s loopback :
R3 sends the packet to it ’s default router , R2 .
R2 sends the packet to R1 and also sends a redirect back to R3 telling it to use R1 in the future for that address :
R2#debug ipv6 icmp
Mar 1 07:00:27.290 : ICMPv6 : Sending REDIRECT for 2001:1::1 , target FE80::1 on FastEthernet0/0
Several NS and solicited NA are also sent between the 3 devices to confirm reachability :
According to RFC 2461 on IPv6 Neighbor Discovery :
A host receiving a valid redirect SHOULD update its Destination Cache accordingly so that subsequent traffic goes to the specified target .
If no Destination Cache entry exists for the destination , an implementation SHOULD create such an entry .
However , a Cisco router acting as a host apparently does not follow this recommendation , as R3 continues trying to send all traffic for R1 ’s loopback to R2 and R2 continues sending redirects .
Godby tries to play both sides .
“ It ’s not like this is WD - 50 , ” the food blogger Jesse Friedman explains , referring to the New York restaurant that serves its eggs Benedict with cylinders of poached yolk , tidy as batteries , and cubes of deep - fried hollandaise sauce , coated in English muffin crumbs .
“ What Jake makes is clearly recognizable as ice cream .
It ’s even ice cream that ’s churned . ”
Godby , you could argue , is even of Waters ’s pastoral San Francisco , making flavors , like Huckleberry Crème Fraîche , that showcase fetishistically selected ingredients .
But he does not always choose the sanctioned taste profiles .
For instance , he also makes Peanut Butter Curry — which includes house - made peanut butter and Vadouvan Golden Mix , a top - of - the - line blend of garlic , shallots , onions and spices .
Godby does this under ice cream ’s cloak of innocence and with a straight face , in the same spirit that Sarah Silverman dresses like a 12 - year - old and tells bigoted jokes .
“ I only make ice cream I think tastes good , ” he claims .
Why do you not want to eat a foie gras ice cream sandwich ?
Or , why do you ?
The effect is disorienting .
The joke might be on us .
According to Vahey , the store ’s frontman , Godby is an artist who uses food as his medium : “ He ’s wielding his paintbrush in ice cream , and Jake would never tell you that . ”
That might seem like a slight overreach , pretentious even , but Vahey does have a point .
Godby has painted or made prints , as a hobby , throughout his adult life .
The only exception being the two years that just ended , the two years during which he conceived and opened Humphry Slocombe .
Currently he ’s working on a portrait series of Isabella Blow , the British eccentric and magazine editor who killed herself by drinking weed killer .
Godby says of his attraction to her , “ I like people who live their lives as art . ”
A WEEK LATER , in the back of the shop , Godby was again in his Chuck Taylors and apron , making Coconut Candy Cap Caramel sorbet .
Because he does n’t want to spend $ 100,000 on a commercial stove , hood and ventilation system , he uses a Bunsen burner to melt the sugar for caramel .
( The hot plate he uses for most cooking jobs does n’t get hot enough . )
Godby opened a Ziploc bag of dried candy cap mushrooms and offered me a smell .
“ A little goes a long way , ” he said of the horsy aroma .
Godby once tried making porcini ice cream .
That and harissa are his only acknowledged busts .

Godby dumped a half - cup of the mushrooms into a spice grinder .
He then pulled out a 20 - liter bucket , poured in two gallons of Straus ice cream base ( California code requires anybody selling more than 2,500 gallons of ice cream a year and not pasteurizing on premises to start with a pasteurized “ mix ” ) and set to work on Salt and Pepper , adding Si­chuan , pink and cubeb peppercorns and sea salt .
Ice cream is simple , but its chemistry is not .
Ice cream , according to C. Clarke , the author of “ The Science of Ice Cream , ” is “ just about the most complex food colloid of all . ”
It ’s an emulsion ( fat droplets in aqueous solution ) , a sol ( ice crystals suspended in liquid ) and a foam .
Eventually Godby ’s young , bearded assistant returned carrying three plastic bags of bourbon and bananas .
“ For the first time ever the guy at the liquor store said , ‘ Why do you buy so much alcohol ? ’ ” the assistant told Godby .
“ I said I put it in ice cream .
He said , ‘ WHAT ?!’
I said he should come by sometime . ”
Godby nodded .
He ’s not a talker .
Vahey describes him as “ pathologically shy . ”
Godby did mention that the previous weekend in Sonoma , he walked by the dead body of a homeless man who ’d been hit by a car .
He knew this was a dark tale , and entirely out of sync with the expected portrait of the happy ice cream man selling ice cream to the happy children .
But that was the point .
Godby enjoyed the dissonance .
The batch freezer whirred in the background .
“ That ’s the ice cream talking , ” he said , then sank into quiet again .
Godby grew up in Zanesville , Ohio , the only child of a mother who worked 30 years at AT&T and a father who owned a bar .
Godby describes Zanesville as “ the kind of town where you ca n’t buy olive oil ” ; himself as “ an odd kid . ”
“ I ’d just wander off ; I still do , ” Godby said , passing the Salt and Pepper to his assistant to freeze and returning to the Coconut Caramel Candy Cap , dumping a large can of congealed coconut milk into the stainless - steel pot .
Godby ’s mother , Linda , is laconic , like her son .
“ I do n’t know what you want me to say , ” she told me when I called .
“ Jake was always backward .
You can tell that yourself . ”
When I asked what she meant by “ backward , ” she described Jake as “ fearless . ”
“ Jake was never afraid to try anything .
At age 5 he had a fit because he wanted to go to a big mall and shop by himself . ”
One of Godby ’s strongest childhood memories is of watching one of his father ’s bar regulars shake so hard in the morning that he had to rig a string , as a pulley , around his neck to help raise his shot glass to his mouth .
Predictably , Godby hated school — “ all weird kids do , ” he told me .
At Ohio State University , he majored in art , smoked a lot of pot and watched a lot of TV , including “ Are You Being Served ? ”
When he committed to open Humphry Slocombe , Godby had 31 ice cream cones tattooed on his arm .
Part of the impulse , he said , was to have something to show San Francisco ’s fanatical food community , to deflect attention away from more deep - seated aspects of himself .
But Chalfant ended up transferring the cases to Judge David P. Yaffe , who then denied the requests .
Judge James C. Chalfant , who has been critical of the city ’s handling of the issue , will rule on the motions .
In a hearing last month on similar requests from four dispensaries , he almost granted an order that would have barred the city from enforcing the ordinance against them .
The city faces 16 lawsuits involving 64 dispensaries and one filed by medical marijuana patients in Los Angeles County Superior Court that seek to overturn the law .
The ordinance , which took the City Council more than two years to draft , would force about 450 dispensaries to close .
In a final - hour bid to stop a new Los Angeles medical marijuana ordinance , lawyers representing dispensaries and patients will ask a judge on Friday morning to issue temporary restraining orders to keep city officials from enforcing the ordinance when it takes effect Monday .
The lawyers appearing before Chalfant on Friday were scheduled to appear Thursday before Yaffe , but they used their right to a peremptory challenge to bump him from the cases .
Eric Shevin , who represents a dozen patients who sued last week , is seeking an order that would keep the city from enforcing the ordinance against any dispensary , saying that it would unconstitutionally restrict access to medical marijuana .
“ There ’s sick people that are suffering tremendous stress wondering if they are going to be able to get their medicine , ” he said .
But David Michaelson , a chief assistant city attorney , said the city will vigorously oppose the motions .
He said that neither the collectives nor the patients will suffer irreparable harm , the standard required to obtain a restraining order .
“ The people of Los Angeles will be irreparably harmed because this ordinance will be prevented from being implemented , ” he said .
The dispensaries are challenging the City Council ’s decision to prohibit all pot shops except those that registered with the City Clerk by Nov. 13 , 2007 , a procedure that allowed 186 to legally operate despite a moratorium on new dispensaries .
City officials believe that 137 are still open .
Those dispensaries will have six months to come into compliance with the ordinance .
In an earlier decision , Chalfant ruled that the City Council failed to follow proper procedures when it extended its moratorium , and declared the ban illegal .
Dispensaries that opened after the ban have cited his ruling in challenging the ordinance .
Chalfant has expressed skepticism about the council ’s use of the 2007 cutoff as a way to reduce the number of dispensaries .
Shevin also hopes to challenge the ordinance based on its restrictions on the location of dispensaries .
“ There will be no room in the majority of Los Angeles for any collective , ” he said .
The ordinance bans dispensaries from locating within 1,000 feet of so - called sensitive uses , such as schools and parks .
It also bans them from abutting residential property .
Critics say the City Council never examined how that residential restriction would affect available locations .
The commercial property on most of the city ’s major boulevards backs up to neighborhoods .
Shevin intends to present maps showing that 95 % of the locations that city officials identified for dispensaries would be eliminated with the residential restriction .
In the Wilshire , Hollywood and Westlake community plan areas , he said , there are just three suitable sites .

It ’s been a big week for racism .
In the last seven days , it ’s been made clear that Tea Party members are racist , state ’s rights advocates are racist , Republicans are racist , and Black Panthers who want to kill white babies are , somehow , not all that racist .
Perhaps the biggest news in racism , however , came after bombs tore through a Ugandan World Cup celebration .
The blast killed 64 people .
Fearlessly , President Obama leapt into action condemning the organization ’s obvious bigotry .
“ They do not regard African life as valuable in and of itself , ” the President said .
“ They see it as a potential place where you can carry out ideological battles that kill innocents without regard to long - term consequences for their short - term tactical gains . ”
Conservative bloggers pounced on the comments , suggesting that , in killing people of color in a country that the president actually cared about , al Qaeda might have finally gone too far .
After all , Bin Laden has managed to kill plenty of black people on U.S. soil , with no charges of racism , so what made this attack different ?
Did the president really see racism as a central theme in al Qaeda ’s existence ?
The White House was asked to clarify their stance .
“ U.S. intelligence has indicated that al Qaeda leadership specifically targets and recruits black Africans to become suicide bombers because they believe that poor economic and social conditions make them more susceptible to recruitment than Arabs , ” an administration official said .
“ Al Qaeda recruits have said that al Qaeda is racist against black members from West Africa because they are only used in lower level operations . ”
As if desperate to confirm the bloggers suspicions , the White House is actually claiming that al Qaeda is racist because , if you ’re a minority , they will only use you as a suicide bomber .
Never mind that they killed members of every imaginable race and religion in the World Trade Center attacks – that ’s not the point .
In the president ’s mind the organization ’s real bigotry lies not in murder , but in its human resources department .
Al Qaeda boasts no room for advancement , no terrorist affirmative action , and the world ’s most brutal glass ceiling .
“ In short , ” the White House said , “ al Qaeda is a racist organization that treats black Africans like cannon fodder and does not value human life . ”
Ummm … do n’t they treat us ALL like cannon fodder ?
Is n’t their disregard for ALL human life the entire point behind their attacks ?
Does the president really believe that being racist holds some kind of moral equivalence with being a global gang of indiscriminate murderers ?
Al Qaeda has , for decades , been blowing up people of all creeds and colors .
When they attacked a plane on Christmas Eve , the president did n’t speak about it for days .
When one of their operatives tried to blow up Times Square , Obama fell silent while we were told the perpetrator was probably some deranged Tea Partier , angry about health care .
Now , when they kill Ugandans , Obama ca n’t wait to get out in front of the cameras .
That Obama ’s quickest condemnation of al Qaeda is a complaint about the racism he sees in a foreign attack ?
Stunning .
At the end of the day , who in the world cares if al Qaeda is racist ?
It ’s a petty , myopic , distraction from the horror these thugs have wrought worldwide .
In the face of constant violence and murder , is n’t it sad that the first “ post - racial president ” seems only to be moved by skin color ?

The Conference that Was n't NATO Diplomats Tune Out the Bad News in Afghanistan
NATO foreign ministers heard only what they wanted to hear on Tuesday in Kabul as they sought to reassure the world that withdrawal can take place in 2014 .
The reality , however , is quite different .
And in the end , Hamid Karzai , who is already looking for ways to cement his post - NATO power , will be the beneficiary .
Barack Obama 's anti-British prejudice helps neither BP nor an alliance that has served the world well for 100 years
President Barack Obama is understandably angry about the Gulf of Mexico oil leak .
The most powerful man in the world , and commander - in - chief of the sole ' hyper - power , ' can only look on impotently as BP - a mere company - lurches from one plan to another in a so - far futile attempt to plug the leak .
His political opponents berate him for doing little or nothing to stem what is being billed as America 's biggest environmental disaster .
Obama can only look on impotently as BP - a mere company - lurches from one plan to another in a so - far futile attempt to plug the leak
So do his green supporters .
On all sides , the hapless President is criticised for being ineffectual .
Doubtless his sense of powerlessness , combined with a fear that his presidency could be fatally weakened if this disaster drags on too long , largely explains his obsession with BP 's allegedly reckless behaviour .
He must find someone to kick .
Yet the extent of his vitriol against BP is unwise and potentially dangerous .
Why say ad nauseam that he holds BP responsible ?
He resembles a judge who , having sentenced a penitent offender , demands again and again that he be brought up from the cells to receive another dressing down for the same crime .
When he flew to Louisiana on May 3 to see things for himself , Mr Obama was eager to pin all the blame on BP , though the company had already admitted responsibility .
' BP is responsible for this leak and BP will pay , ' he declared .
This has become a regular refrain .
Ten days later , on May 13 , he laid into BP for the ' cosy relationship ' it had allegedly enjoyed with regulators in Washington , and he chastised the company and its contractors ' for falling over each other to point the finger of blame at someone else ' .
On May 30 , he said that he was ' enraged and heartbroken ' after BP 's latest attempt to staunch the flow had failed .
Why ' enraged ' ?
It was almost as though BP had deliberately failed to find a solution in order to prolong the environmental damage and cock a snook at the President .
Two days ago he instituted an FBI criminal investigation , no less , into the Gulf of Mexico oil leak , promising to ' bring those responsible to justice ' .
The effect was to send BP 's shares into a new tailspin : they have now fallen by more than a third since the Deepwater Horizon rig caught fire and sank towards the end of April .
One can appreciate Mr Obama 's sense of frustration , as well as his political instinct that the best way to deflect criticism from himself is to attack the widely unpopular British company , whose own spin doctors seem curiously inept .
But it is difficult to imagine that the President would have been so remorselessly vituperative had BP been an American oil company such as the even bigger ExxonMobil .
These are different times , of course , but when the Exxon Valdez oil tanker sank off Alaska in 1989 , its American owners , Exxon , were not treated like criminals by the U.S. government .
Equally , when the north sea oil rig Piper Alpha exploded in 1988 at the cost of 167 lives , the then Prime Minister , Margaret thatcher , did not inveigh against its American owners .
The President 's public evisceration of BP cannot merely be explained by his feelings of impotence or his political predicament .
There is an additional factor .
BP , after all , stands for British Petroleum .
I do n't wish to sound paranoid , but it is pretty clear that Mr Obama does not much like anything that is British .
There is an anti-British undertow throughout his book dreams From My Father , with slighting references to the country and its citizens .
Most significantly , he reveals - or perhaps I should say ' alleges ' , since no evidence is produced - that his Kenyan grandfather was tortured by the British authorities during the Mau Mau rebellion in Kenya in the Fifties .
I imagine that if my grandfather had been tortured by , say , the Venezuelans , I might nurse a lingering prejudice against their country , and I do not particularly blame Mr Obama for bearing his grievance .
What is undeniable , though , is that it has helped to shape his feelings about Britain .
Unlike his immediate predecessors - Ronald Reagan , George Bush , Bill Clinton and George W. Bush - he displays no affection for , or interest in , this country and its history .
When he entered the Oval office , he immediately returned a bust of Winston Churchill that had been loaned to George W. Bush by the British government .
Mr Obama 's administration has been notably cool towards Britain .
For example , during the recent stand - off between Britain and Argentina over oil rights around the Falkland islands , the U.S. was at best neutral , at worst pro-Argentine , whereas during the Falklands War it had been strongly supportive of this country .
It is true that BP is a private company with many foreign investors , and has no direct relationship with the British government .
But it was , until its recent tribulations , Britain 's largest company , and its fortunes affect millions of British investors and pensioners .
A takeover of a depleted and weakened BP by an American rival such as ExxonMobil would have serious consequences for the British economy .
All that can be said with confidence is that the President 's invective against BP is not helping the company , and is therefore potentially damaging to the United Kingdom .
I can't imagine David Cameron or nice Nick Clegg picking on a U.S. oil company whose tanker had inadvertently dumped millions of barrels of oil on British shores .
Moreover , listening to Mr Obama one might think that BP had instructed its contractors to drill for oil in the Gulf of Mexico without bothering to consult the U.S. government .
The same President who last week ordered a halt to exploratory deep water drilling in the Gulf proposed opening up 167 million acres to offshore oil exploration only three weeks before the Deepwater Horizon explosion .
A little more presidential humility would be in order and , more than that , a greater sense of statesmanship and more feeling for a close ally .
No one doubts that BP has a serious case to answer , and extensive reparations to make , but it does not fol low that its executives should be treated as common criminals , or that the company should be hammered into the ground .
Whatever Mr Obama may think of Britain in historical terms , this country remains America 's most loyal ally , paying with the blood of hundreds of its young men in Iraq and Afghanistan .
It is not Chinese or Japanese or , for the most part , French and German soldiers who stand alongside Americans in Afghanistan , but British ones .
While for all his many faults George W. Bush was often publicly appreciative of Britain 's role as America 's most hands - on ally , President Obama can scarcely bring himsel f to acknowledge this country 's sacrifice in Afghanistan which , in terms of lives lost , is proportionately greater than that of the United States .
Presidents come and go , and nothing , I hope , will undo the ties that bind these two countries .
Barack Obama is nonetheless well on the way to souring a relationship that over the past hundred years has brought huge benefit to the civilised world , and I hope the next time he opens his mouth to castigate BP he will remember that this is a company that matters a great deal to Great Britain .

We have been making choices in games for years .
Whether you ’re earning Light Side points or racking up bad karma , morality in gaming has traditionally relied on the extremes of good and evil .
Dragon Age : Origins successfully presented a world full of choices that went beyond traditional black - and - white options , and Dragon Age II will continue the trend .
During our visit to BioWare ’s Edmonton studio , we sat to chat with Dragon Age II executive director Mark Darrah about the team ’s approach to morality in its fantasy universe .
Of course , Darrah did n’t want to spoil any of the tough decisions players will have to make as Hawke in Dragon Age II , but he did discuss the philosophies that guide the creation of significant , memorable choices – without resorting to the simplified good - or - evil dynamic .
One reason why Origins could take a more nuanced approach to decision - making was the elimination of a feature that BioWare itself had helped popularize : the morality bar .
You ’ve undoubtedly seen one before – a scale with good and evil at each end , and a slider that moves according to the nature of your actions .
While it ’s fun to see concrete evidence of your choices , the morality bar imposes a restriction on them , too .
It requires that every choice you make be classified as good or evil , leading players to behave as ruthless despots or selfless paragons , but without much room for anything in between .
“ The thing about the morality bar is that it gives players a choice , but it simplifies it , ” says Darrah .
“ It ’s like watching a cartoon , to a certain degree .
I ’m not saying that as a bad thing – it makes the choices a bit easier without taking the choice away completely . ”
Like Origins , Dragon
Age II wo n’t use a bar to gauge your moral progress , because the situations Hawke will encounter in the Free Marches fall into more of a gray area .
Players wo n’t always be choosing whether to save a burning orphanage or watch as the flames devour it ; the pivotal decisions are interesting because there is no clear correct path – just action and consequence .
“ When the team starts applying their own morality to the system , then you ’re forcing the player onto your morality , ” Darrah explains .
“ We ’re not forced to make the call between good and evil , and we ’re not forcing you to make that call .
Do what you think is appropriate , and there will be consequences . ”
Think back to Origins ’ situation with the possessed boy , Connor , in Redcliffe .
Only one of the available paths has a pleasant outcome , and it is the hardest to achieve .
All other avenues result in the player having to sacrifice something – and when weighing the life of a mother or that of her son , it ’s does n’t feel like morality has much to do with it .
“ Games with a stronger morality illustration , you ca n’t really give me a choice that ’s hard , ” Darrah explains .
“ If I can see both sides of it , it ’s much harder to call one of them good and one evil . ”
So , how does BioWare create situations where all of the options seem viable ?
By creating believable – though not necessarily realistic – characters who have their own goals .
If the player is able to understand why a character wants something , it becomes more difficult condemn that character ’s actions
“ There are no moustache - twirling villains , ” says Darrah .
“ They think they ’re good .
They all think they ’re doing something for the best reasons .
They may be wrong , but they think they ’re doing things for the right reasons . ”
An excellent example of a complex character from Origins is Teyrn Loghain .
While his betrayal at Ostagar seems sinister , his actions make sense once players learn more about him .
He remembers a time when Ferelden was controlled by the Orlesians , and he was the hero of the war that drove them out .
He loves his country , and will do anything to ensure it does n’t fall again to foreign conquerors .
His history with Orlais may have blinded him to the real threat , but even in his apparently insidious actions during the course of Origins , he was doing what he thought was best for Ferelden .
Good and evil are not absolute .
Loghain did evil things with good intentions , and players in Dragon Age II will also have to consider not only their actions , but their reasons for taking them .
“ Ultimately , evil comes down to motivation at the moment , ” says Darrah .
“ A lot of games tend to punish or reward you based on outcome as opposed to minute - to - minute motivation .
‘ Why are you doing this ? ’
‘ I ’m doing this because I want the money . ’
Well , that ’s kind of an evil thing .
To my mind , it does n’t really matter if you ’re saving the saving the orphanage because you want the money .
That ’s still an evil decision , even if you saved the orphanage . ”
Not every choice Hawke makes in Dragon Age II will change the balance of power in the Free Marches .
Like Origins , players will face decisions on multiple tiers , affecting anywhere between one life and hundreds .
However , the size of the choices is n’t necessarily what makes them interesting .
Instead , it ’s the context around them – the characters , the goals , and the consequences ( big and small ) .
This is one of the areas where Dragon Age : Origins was strongest , turning morality into more than a tug - of - war between good and evil .
Dragon
Age II will continue to develop this signature aspect of the series , and as one of the studios that helped refine the concept of choice in gaming , BioWare undoubtedly has more compelling surprises in store .

GISS tells us that it was the hottest May on record .
Just looking at that map makes me perspire .
It must be wicked hot at the North Pole !
But wait a minute !
The DMI record does n’t look so hot in the Arctic .
What could be wrong ?
Could it be the fact that GISS has almost no coverage in the Arctic ?
We often hear the question ” what if CO2 were pink ? ”
Answer : it would still be almost invisible at 0.0004 concentration .
Now , let ’s turn that around and see what GISS coverage holes would like if they were pink .
Shocking pink , that is .
GISS is claiming a global temperature record based largely on the Arctic – in which they have less than 10 % coverage .
Hansen explains the growing gap between GISS and Had - Crut as being due to the fact that GISS has better Arctic coverage .
Judge for yourself .
GISS has 2010 at # 1 . Had - Crut has 2010 at # 4 .
Thanks to GISS ’ extensive Arctic coverage .

Beautiful Alberta , Canada ??
US enviro group is putting up billboards in four U.S. cities urging Americans to exclude Alberta from their travel plans , saying it is “ one of the world ’s dirtiest destinations ” .
Let ’s be clear here : I am not a supporter of this use of a big “ economic ” club to hit govt over the head to get their attention .
It will hurt many Albertans who are in the tourist biz where many likely support a moratorium on new tar sands development .
Indeed most Albertans have said they want a “ time out ” in the tar sands .
But big oil says no way and are pushing for faster approvals of new projects with “ streamlined environmental reviews ” of course .
In their Re-Think Alberta Campaign enviro groups say they are trying to counter Alberta and Canadian government propaganda .
Canada is lobbying the US to prevent any cleaner - fuel regulations because the tar sands has the world ’s highest CO2 levels and is the most destructive form of oil production .
Yes worse , than off shore drilling – see here for more
“ And they are also down here lobbying for infrastructure , new pipelines , refineries , which would keep us addicted to high - carbon oil for another 50 years . ”
Corporate Ethics International Executive Director Michael Marx told Reuters .
1.3 million barrels of dirty oil is shipped from tar sands region to the US every day
Corporate Ethics also has a powerful video about the ongoing environmental mess that can easily be seen from space it is so big .

Is there ever an appropriate time to end a comic by zooming in on a character , breaking the fourth wall by having them look directly at the viewer and wink , and then circle wiping to black ?
Just so I know for future reference .

First of all , let 's just say it : this is the most bizarre - looking bicycle saddle of all time .
Feel free to disagree , but c'mon , just look at the thing - it's like the bike is sporting a leaf rake , or perhaps even a rib cage .
Like most funny - looking bike seats , however , the Manta promises to rectify one of the most common of cyclists ' complaints ... the all - too - familiar " numb bum . "
Instead of a traditional rigid saddle form , the Manta features a series of elements that tilt from side to side along a central axle , allowing them to move up and down with your legs .
The idea behind this design is that it will keep the pressure off the rider 's perineum , in particular the pudendal arteries , prostate and associated nerves .
It is also claimed to provide three to four times the support area of conventional saddles , thus distributing your weight more evenly and minimizing peak pressure points .
As a nice side benefit , it offers better butt ventilation , too .
It 's interesting to note that the Manta does have a slightly raised spine running down the center , which seems to be at odds with the " love channel " on many traditional saddles - a cut - out area that ( supposedly ) keeps the rider 's crotch from pressing against the seat .
One would assume this is something they 've taken into account .
The Manta bicycle saddle
The Manta saddle is available in configurations that emphasize light weight ( 9 elements ) or extra support ( 13 elements ) .
The second version is currently only available on back order , but the light version can be purchased for GBP77.96 ( US $ 112.80 ) through the company 's website .
Via InventorSpot .
UPDATE : Nov. 24/11 United
Sport , the company that makes what was formerly known as the Manta , has informed us that the product has now been rebranded as the new - and - improved Evolve Saddle .

Please do n’t take offense , but I ’m going to take a wiiiiiiiiiiiiild guess here and assume that some of the readers of a site called Geekosystem may have been picked on at one time or another .
If that ’s true , you may be heartened to hear about the successful reemergence of one of the most famous geeks ever , a guy who was ridiculed ( on YouTube ) by over one billion people .
That ’s right , I ’m talking about Ghyslain Raza , a.k.a. the Star Wars Kid .
Motherboard.tv recently made a documentary about internet culture and those affected by it .
While researching , they discovered what happened to Raza after he starred in one of the most popular viral videos of all time :
“ Not as many people know the rest of the story : Ghyslain Raza – or to the internet , Star Wars Kid – did n’t feel famous , or funny .
He felt harassed , the victim of the most visible bullying in history .
Ghyslain dropped out of his Quebec high school , was diagnosed with depression , and checked into a psychiatric ward for children .
Ghyslain and his parents would later sue the families of the three classmates who leaked the video in 2003 , for around $ 250,000 .
According to the lawsuit , which resulted in a settlement , “ Ghyslain had to endure , and still endures today , harassment and derision from his high - school mates and the public at large . ”
But after eight years of laughs at his expense – and a few campaigns in his defense – Ghyslain is back .
Now in his early 20s , he ’s reemerged as the president of the Patrimoine Trois - Rivières , a conservation society that aims to preserve the cultural heritage of his hometown of Trois - Rivières .
Revenge of the Sith this is n’t , but he ’s putting his litigious experience to some use , getting his law degree at McGill University in Montreal . ”
Ah , a law degree ; the only thing more dangerous than a lightsaber .
Good for him !
The post included a picture from a Canadian newspaper Le Nouvelliste which showed Raza , now looking older , happier , and impressively svelte .
So , all you little geeks out there take heed .
If Raza can overcome his past and become a happy adult , so can anyone !

Summer is officially here .
It 's the time when everything gets hotter , including the women .
Here 's a list of the 10 hottest girls named Summer , just to start this hemisphere off on a festive note .
But , on a negative note do n't expect to get with one of these girls , unless of course you 're one of the richest people in America ...
Honestly though , what else do hot girls care about anymore ?
Who are the hottest girls named Summer ?
This list will give you that answer along with a slew of other possibilities who are extremely sexy as well .
You can vote up or down your favorite or least favorite person named Summer .
There was a tap at the door at five in the morning .
She woke up .
Shit .
Now what ?
She ’d fallen asleep with her Palm Tungsten T3 in her hand .
It would take only a moment to smash it against the wall and shove the battery up the nose of whoever was out there annoying her .
She went to the door .
“ I know you ’re home , ” he said .
Kalle fucking Blomkvist .
She tried to remember whether she was speaking to him or not .
Probably not .
She tried to remember why .
No one knew why .
It was undoubtedly because she ’d been in a bad mood at some point .
Lisbeth Salander was entitled to her bad moods on account of her miserable childhood and her tiny breasts , but it was starting to become confusing just how much irritability could be blamed on your slight figure and an abusive father you had once deliberately set on fire and then years later split open the head of with an axe .
Salander opened the door a crack and spent several paragraphs trying to decide whether to let Blomkvist in .
Many italic thoughts flew through her mind .
Go away .
Perhaps .
So what .
Etc .
“ Please , ” he said .
“ I must see you .
The umlaut on my computer is n’t working . ”
He was cradling an iBook in his arms .
She looked at him .
He looked at her .
She looked at him .
He looked at her .
And then she did what she usually did when she had run out of italic thoughts : she shook her head .
“ I ca n’t really go on without an umlaut , ” he said .
“ We ’re in Sweden . ”
But where in Sweden were they ?
There was no way to know , especially if you ’d never been to Sweden .
A few chapters ago , for example , an unscrupulous agent from Swedish Intelligence had tailed Blomkvist by taking Stora Essingen and Gröndal into Södermalm , and then driving down Hornsgatan and across Bellmansgatan via Brännkyrkagatan , with a final left onto Tavastgatan .
Who cared , but there it was , in black - and - white , taking up space .
And now Blomkvist was standing in her doorway .
Someone might still be following him — but who ?
There was no real way to be sure even when you found out , because people ’s names were so confusingly similar — Gullberg , Sandberg , and Holmberg ; Nieminen and Niedermann ; and , worst of all , Jonasson , Mårtensson , Torkelsson , Fredriksson , Svensson , Johansson , Svantesson , Fransson , and Paulsson .
“ I need my umlaut , ” Blomkvist said .
“ What if I want to go to Svavelsjö ?
Or Strängnäs ?
Or Södertälje ?
What if I want to write to Wadensjö ?
Or Ekström or Nyström ? ”
It was a compelling argument .
She opened the door .
He handed her the computer and went to make coffee on her Jura Impressa X7 .
She tried to get the umlaut to work .
No luck .
She pinged Plague and explained the problem .
Plague was fat , but he would know what to do , and he would tell her , in Courier typeface .
Where are you ?
Plague wrote .
Stockholm .
There ’s an Apple Store at the intersection of Kungsgatan and Sveavägen .
Or you could try a Q - tip .
She went to the bathroom and got a Q - tip and gently cleaned the area around the Alt key .
It popped into place .
Then she pressed “ U. ” An umlaut danced before her eyes .
Finally , she spoke .
“ It ’s fixed , ” she said .
“ Thanks , ” he said .
She thought about smiling , but she ’d smiled three hundred pages earlier , and once was enough . ♦
LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) - A white transit police officer was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter on Thursday in the videotaped shooting death of an unarmed black man that triggered a night of rioting in Oakland , California .
The defendant in the racially charged trial , Johannes Mehserle , 28 , testified that he mistakenly drew his pistol instead of his electric Taser weapon and shot Oscar Grant , 22 , while trying to subdue him during a New Year ’s Day 2009 confrontation .
But prosecutors said in closing arguments that Mehserle “ lost all control ” and intentionally shot Grant because he was resisting arrest .
The Los Angeles County jury of four men and eight women deliberated for about six hours over two days before reaching their verdict , indicating they essentially believed Mehserle ’s account that he shot Grant accidentally .
Juries can find a defendant guilty of involuntary manslaughter if they believe he lacked the intent to kill but that his actions were so grossly negligent that he should be held criminally responsible for them .
Legal experts have said involuntary manslaughter is generally punishable by two to four years in prison .
It is rare for a law enforcement officer to be charged with murder in connection with an on - duty shooting .
Police in Oakland , across the Bay to the east of San Francisco , moved to a tactical alert status as they braced for the possibility of renewed violence following the verdict .
But civic leaders appealed for calm .
Demonstrations by supporters of Grant , a young father who worked as a grocery store butcher , were planned in Oakland and Los Angeles .
“ We do n’t know if we ’re going to have a riot or a celebration , but either way we ’re going to have one , ” protester Cindy Delgado said outside the downtown Los Angeles courthouse before the verdict was announced .
“ I ’m concerned about riots .
I do n’t want to be hit by a bottle , ” said Francisco Raygoza , 30 , an accountant leaving work in San Francisco .
“ Our office manager said leave as soon as you can . ”
Video footage of the slaying shown widely over the Internet and television , appeared to show Grant lying face down on the train platform when he was shot in the back .
Mehserle was seen holstering his gun immediately afterward and putting his hands on his head as in disbelief .
The killing unleashed charges of police brutality and a night of civil unrest in Oakland , where demonstrators smashed store windows and set cars on fire .
Police arrested over 100 people on charges of vandalism , unlawful assembly and assault .
The Alameda County Superior Court judge in the case , which was moved to Los Angeles because of heavy pretrial publicity in Oakland , ruled that the jury could not consider a first - degree murder charge .
Judge Robert Perry held there was too little evidence to show the killing was premeditated .
Had he been convicted of second - degree murder , Mehserle faced a sentence of 15 years to life in prison .
The jury could alternatively have found him guilty of voluntary manslaughter or acquitted him entirely .
Image caption Chillies cultivated by Native Americans are among those entering the vault
Seeds from some of North America 's hottest food crops have arrived on the Arctic Archipelago of Svalbard to be stored in a " doomsday vault " .
The consignment of chilli seeds was delivered to the frozen outpost by a delegation of seven US senators .
Built deep inside a mountain , the vault is designed to protect the world 's main food plants from future disasters .
Since opening in 2008 , it has stored seeds from more than half a million of the planet 's crops .
" The chillies really are an interesting story , " said Cary Fowler , executive director of the Global Crop Diversity Trust , which funds the operation and management of the seed vault .
The seed vault in Svalbard will be the safety deposit box that ensures that we can keep that food supply intact Benjamin Cardin , , Democrat Senator for Maryland
" They are traditional varieties ; they have colourful names and histories , " he told BBC News .
" A number of the varieties were provided by a fantastic group of nine US government organisations called Native Seed Search who work with Native American communities .
" These ( chilli plant ) varieties have been safeguarded for a long time and long may it continue , " Dr Fowler added
" But that - of course - depends on an unbroken chain going into the future and you can never really count on such a thing . "
In from the cold
Among the varieties to be deposited in the vault was Wenk 's Yellow Hots , a pepper that starts out yellow and hot before losing some of its potency and turning red .

The remote , frozen landscape provides an ideal backdrop for the vault
Another specimen was the " unpredictable " San Juan Tsile , described as a pepper with a heat that has been described as " ranging as anything from mild to medium to hot " .
This particular variety is still cultivated by elder farmers in a Native American community in New Mexico .
The group delivering the seeds was led by Benjamin Cardin , Democrat Senator for Maryland , who said the all parts of the world were interdependent when it came to crop diversity .
" As we manage the impact of climate change around the world , the seed vault in Svalbard will be the safety deposit box that ensures that we can keep that food supply intact , " he said .
The seeds from the chilli plants , along with other samples such as soy , melon and sorghum , were provided by the US Department of Agriculture 's ( USDA ) National Plant Germplasm , based in Colorado .
" [ We ] have a strong commitment to sharing our crop diversity to ensure that Svalbard is well positioned to protect the world 's genetic diversity , " explained Edward Knipling , administrator for the USDA 's Agricultural Research Service ( ARS ) .
The seeds are preserved at a temperature of - 18C ( - 0.4 F ) in two secure store rooms located 130 m ( 426 ft ) inside a mountain .
The vault has been designed to store duplicates of seeds from collections from all around the world .
If the nation 's seeds are lost as a result of a natural disaster , such as widespread flooding , the seed collections could be re-established using the specimens stored in the Arctic .
The £ 5 m ( $ 7 m ) facility took 12 months to build and opened in February 2008 .
IT READS like a James Bond novel : its cast includes an enigmatic white - haired computer hacker ; a soldier turned whistleblower ; secret government correspondence ; and the world 's most powerful country desperate to contain the situation .
And it is all because of an Australian .
Julian Assange
Julian Assange , the Australian - born face of the Wikileaks website , is in hiding overseas after the US military arrested one of its own soldiers , Bradley Manning , and accused him of leaking a secret video of a US Army helicopter gunning down civilians in Iraq in 2007 .
The video was released on Wikileaks earlier this year , and the US is now desperate to find Mr Assange before he leaks thousands of embarrassing state diplomatic cables , which are believed to discuss the the Middle East , its governments and leaders .
Somehow the wiener rash disappearance and restraint in saying “ eggs ” seem connected .

Madison Ashton has made a claim against the estate of Richard Pratt .
Picture courtesy Channel Nine
But 14 months after his death , when last month 's Queen 's Birthday honours list was issued , it was silent on the subject of Richard Pratt .
He will now never be officially honoured .
Instead , it was his tormentor , Graeme Samuel of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission , who was made a Companion of the Order of Australia .
And now Sydney - based Penthouse Pet and former prostitute Madison Ashton has come forward to claim part of his $ 5 billion empire .
This smashes the spin surrounding Pratt 's long - term relationship with his official mistress , Shari - Lea Hitchcock , that the tycoon 's life was simply '' unconventional ' ' and ' ' European ' ' , and that he was devoted to two families , not just one .
It 's become a cliche to say that Pratt was a complex man .
He was brilliant at business - intuitive , intelligent , visionary , capable of manic hard work and creative thinking .
He could be charming , caring , impulsively generous to employees , friends and strangers alike .
His philanthropy , worth $ 150 million or more , is a monument to him and particularly to his wife Jeanne , who drove the giving campaign .
But some former executives and competitors , people who were bullied , damaged and ripped off by Pratt , say it 's now time to balance the ledger of his life .
Sharl - Lea Hitchcock with their daughter , Paula .
Picture courtesy Australian Women 's Weekly A Sunday
Age investigation has revealed a dark side to Pratt that played out through decades of questionable business deals and borderline criminality - allegations of bribes , thugs , systematic tax evasion , intimidation , the use of prostitutes and the purchase of political influence .
'' He was living a double life , '' said one former executive of Pratt 's Visy company , a respected Melbourne business figure .
'' He was 50 per cent above board successful businessman , philanthropist ; the other half was a very flawed character - multiple women , money under the table , mistresses , bribery and corruption . ''
In Pratt 's mind , according to critics , any problem could be fixed with money , and every interaction turned to his advantage .
Anything was justified if it served his craving for two things : riches and respectability .
By the end of his life , he had achieved the first in spades .
But as the honours list shows , the latter , most desperately craved , ultimately eluded him .
Alan Hancock is perhaps Pratt 's most vocal foe , in life and death .
Lured to Visy in the late 1980s to start an outpost of the business in Perth , Hancock was welcomed into the close - knit , family - oriented atmosphere of the company .
He lived for a while in Melbourne , dined regularly at the Pratt 's palatial Kew residence , Raheen , and became a Pratt confidant .
He was put in charge of Anthony Pratt , the then feckless son who would eventually take over the company and become , in turn , Australia 's richest man .
But by 1993 things had turned sour , with Hancock claiming Pratt owed him $ 2 million as part of his salary package .
When Hancock quit Visy , Pratt began a campaign to discredit his former employee , bankrupt him , and have him investigated , on confected charges , by police .
Hancock retaliated , alleging publicly as early as 1993 that Visy and Amcor were colluding on prices , prompting an investigation by the Australian Trade Practices Commission , the forerunner of the ACCC .
That investigation found nothing .
Hancock still has pieces of butcher 's paper on which Pratt wrote after a 1987 meeting about his plan to '' share everything ' ' with APM , Amcor 's predecessor .
Based on this and other documents , Hancock maintains that the duopoly cartel had been in full operation since 1989 , 11 years earlier than the ACCC was able to prove .
It was through this illegal arrangement , says Hancock , that Pratt 's phenomenal wealth was secured .
If true , this would mean the damage to the Australian economy of the cartel would be more in the order of $ 2 billion rather than the $ 700 million estimated by lawyers pursuing a class action over the cartel 's proven duration , from 2000 to 2004 .
Others in a position to know have questioned the 1989 start date , but confirmed to The Sunday Age that a cosy arrangement was well under way by the early 1990s .
But Hancock , backed by other sources formerly close to the Pratt empire , says Visy 's phenomenal early growth during the 1970s and 1980s had its foundation in a different illegal activity - bribery .
'' Richard told me in the old Kew house [ which he lived in before buying the Italianate mansion , Raheen ] : ' See that bloke there ?
I 'm bribing him .
I 'm bribing that man ' , '' Hancock recalls . ''
' I could be considered Australia 's biggest briber .
I want to fix it . '
I think he meant it at the time . ''
In most businesses , the executive in charge of deciding who provides the boxes for your product does not have a glamorous job .
But Pratt recognised that his success relied on relationships with those people .
Pratt considered these men '' highly corruptible in easy ways '' , a former Visy executive recalls .
They were invited to glamorous parties , flown to exotic destinations , their wives feted at parties attended by celebrities .
This might be considered good business practice .
But some were also given cash in brown paper bags , cars , speedboats as Christmas presents .
'' There were flying lessons in aeroplanes for a year or two at a time - a lot of people got their pilot 's licences …
And when somebody 's in a position to sign a $ 10 million contract , a $ 20,000 motor car for their girlfriend is n't a big deal , '' the source said .
As a big supplier to the fruit and vegetable industry , notorious for its cash transactions , Pratt always had plenty of tax - free cash to splash around to pay for his largesse .
On top of that , Pratt artificially inflated the price of paper imports before sale through the use of two sets of books , and the extra money was creamed off to pay for illicit activities .
Former employees from the 1990s say business clients were entertained by escorts at his parties in some places , and clients were also sent to Melbourne brothels , at Pratt 's expense , to help seal the deal .
It was not just box - buyers in receipt of Pratt 's generosity .
Pratt would also influence people higher up the corporate ladder in an organisation he was targeting .
He would orchestrate apparently chance encounters with senior executives , even chief executives who were known to be travelling overseas .
'' And that person may be told , ' Why do n't you stop off in my magnificent place in Honolulu ?
I 've got a big apartment there ' …
Dick would just happen to have the keys with him and he'd say , ' All you 've got to do when you leave is sign the visitors ' register ' , '' the source said .
'' And then , a year later when there 's a $ 20 million contract on the line , he'd ask them , ' Well , did you have a good time a year ago ? '
Some of those guys were the big hitters in the Australian business scene . ''
The sources , who declined to be named , also allege that many politicians , as well as union officials and executives in competitor companies , were bribed or received favours with an expectation of support .
It worked .
When Pratt got into trouble with the National Crime Authority in the mid-1990s , very few politicians raised his conduct as an issue - a situation attributed by a Labor apparatchik at the time as being because Pratt '' has been very clever and built up friendships and support ' ' .
Sources have told The Sunday Age that former Trades Hall secretary John Halfpenny was regularly handed brown paper bags stuffed with cash .
'' Dick hated unions , but believed you could buy them off .
But they'd take the money and not do anything , '' one former executive remembers .
Pratt 's impulse to pay people off never wavered .
The story about his best - known mistress , Shari - Lea Hitchcock , emerged in 2000 because one of Pratt 's operatives tried to hand a bag of cash to the nanny who was preparing to expose the relationship , but mistakenly approached a Fairfax reporter instead .
And in 2007 , when the ACCC was trying to nail Visy for the cartel , Pratt 's lawyers quickly agreed to a record high fine of $ 35 million on the condition that Pratt himself could be shielded from exposure for his personal participation in discussions with Amcor 's Russell Jones .
The ACCC did not accept this first offer and Pratt was forced to concede his role , as well as pay a record fine .
'' He would never agree to anything unless there was absolutely irrefutable evidence .
You could get him on video doing something wrong and he'd still deny it , '' one associate said .
By the mid-1980s , Pratt was becoming a very rich man , and as he aspired to join the corporate titans of the day , he began dabbling in dangerous financial transactions .
His involvement with his mate , then Elders IXL chief John Elliott , in the defence of BHP in 1986 led to a series of payments that saw him pursued for years by the National Crime Authority .
His Battery Group 's ownership and later sale of two insurance companies , Regal and Occidental , sent one man to jail and led to the suicide of another , former Commonwealth Bank executive Vern Christie .
Pratt lost respect in the business community over these deals , but escaped otherwise unscathed .
One Visy document , however , obtained by The Sunday Age and entitled '' Strictly Private & Confidential F[or ] . Y[ our ] .
E[yes ]
Only '' , suggests that a decade after some of these deals , Pratt still feared exposure .
' 'A number of persons have probably still got documents relating to ACI , Battery , BHP , Occidental etc , despite the efforts [ of Pratt operatives to get rid of them ] , '' the document says .
The document does not identify either an author or a recipient , but is labelled : '' Update on security and related aspects of Pratt Group / Visy Industries , November 1996 . ''
An extraordinary artefact , it 's clearly written by one of Pratt 's security men , and it also reveals the extent of Visy 's tax evasion , political manoeuvring , and use of underhanded tactics in business .
'' The tax department , '' the document says , ''is still a major achilles heal ( sic ) ' ' , particularly the issue of '' executive salaries and the ' tax sensitive ' material ' ' .
It makes clear - a story supported by Hancock and other former executives - that Visy was paying executives a large proportion of their benefits under the table , and out of reach of the tax department , using a ' ' black ' ' chequebook .
One had a tennis court built at his property , another a swimming pool , and many whitegoods were purchased , Hancock says .
The document confirms that the pay slip of one senior executive , which was left lying on his desk , '' represents less than half of his package ' ' which '' creates a vulnerability ' ' .
'' There could be a F[ ringe ] B[enefits ] T[ax ] , payroll tax and group tax liability in excess of $ 50,000,000 with penalties .
In particular , under Victorian state payroll tax legislation there is a vulnerability back into the ' 70s for evasion . ''
Of payments to another executive the document says , '' the tax department must not see any of the detail '' , particularly a document that included the words : '' Confirmed by R. Pratt that all three areas are to be paid out of Australia . ''
There is reference to a note in Pratt 's handwriting which says , '' Shred everything - RP ' ' .
Pratt 's approach to tax was consistently aggressive throughout his career .
He admitted to being involved in the ' ' bottom of the harbour ' ' tax schemes in the 1980s .
Michael Brereton , the tax lawyer whose clients are at the centre of the Wickenby investigation into illegal offshore tax transactions , was on Pratt 's payroll , earning $ 82,200 over four months in 1996 , and Pratt was the biggest single investor in conman Max Green 's scam , investing $ 1.19 million in what was sold to the Jewish business community as a tax - minimisation scheme .
The documents reveal that Pratt 's security men had other concerns , too .
Employees are named , one for her predilection for '' pot and men ' ' , another for his '' drinking problem ' ' .
Of a former Liberal politician it's said that '' since the BMW transaction ( $ 174,000 ) ... [ he ] has become somewhat cavalier ...
He appears to be taking advantage of Richard Pratt ’s long - term friendship and trust plus ‘ knows too much ’ . ’’
Then comes a frank admission of what Pratt was buying with his large donations to both big political parties :
‘‘ The fact of political donations being followed by letters from Richard Pratt for assistance ... could cause embarrassment for the recipient and the author , ’’ the document says .
Politicians are summed up for their reliability .
‘‘ Whilst a number of prominent politicians and others are on side , Daryl Williams QC [ the then attorney - general ] is to some degree an unknown quantity and Peter Costello is far from over the line . ’’
Williams is considered by both sides of politics to have been a straight shooter , and Costello never crossed the line to Pratt ’s side .
John Howard was publicly praising Pratt during the cartel case between 2007 and 2009 while Costello remained silent .
A corporate source said that , at two separate functions during the case , Pratt demanded of Costello that he call Graeme Samuel off the case .
At one ANZ Bank function , the source recalls , ‘ ‘[ Pratt ] was absolutely beside himself when he saw [ Samuel ] and said to Peter Costello ... that he ought to do something to pull him into line .
Costello said , ‘ [ Samuel ] is just doing what he has to do , it ’s his job ’ . ’’
Pratt ’s wooing of politicians went beyond donations to the two big parties .
One document collected by Hancock shows that after he finished as prime minister , Bob Hawke was on the Visy payroll , earning $ 8333.33 every month between September 1995 and June 1996 , or $ 85,661 for the year , for ‘‘ consulting services ’ ’ .
Gough and Margaret Whitlam received $ 27,000 over the same period .
Malcolm Fraser has confirmed to The Sunday Age that Pratt put him on the Visy payroll between approximately 1985 and 1987 .
‘‘ I gave him some help and advice on international matters ...
It was about markets and maybe how to approach markets , ’’ Fraser said .
‘‘ People like Hawke and myself could open doors that he himself could n’t open , ’’ he said , emphasising this did not include political doors .
Many others enjoyed lucrative consultancies .
Among them were former NSW premier Nick Greiner and one of his key staff , Ken Hooper .
Shipping consultant Peter Wilson , who was later employed ( along with a number of other senior Visy staff ) by former workplace relations minister Peter Reith to help devise the 1996 waterfront strategy , was given a consultancy , as were Mick Miller , the former Victorian chief commissioner of police , and past competition policy chief Fred Hilmer .
Pratt is lionised for his kindness to employees .
He knew many of them by name , and saw many of them during his famous morning walks around his factories .
But union officials say there was a darker side to this .
Australian Manufacturing Workers ’ Union national print division secretary Lorraine Cassin remembers a number of industrial disputes at Visy ’s Dandenong site where workers were intimidated by Hells Angels bikies hired by Pratt .
‘‘ We had an employee car in front of the gate driven over by a Kenworth truck about 12 or 14 years ago , ’’ Cassin says .
The truck was driven by an employee of Cadpro , a trucking company with a Visy contract that at the time was owned by the now - imprisoned Hells Angels boss , Stephen Rogers .
‘‘ It was run by bikies , ’’ confirms another former executive , whose loyalties remain with Pratt .
‘‘ The contract , performance , cost , they did better than anyone else . ’’
Rumours aired in 2007 by 3AW broadcaster Derryn Hinch might explain why Cadpro could provide trucking services cheaper than their competitors — it ’s said the bikies were using Visy trucks to traffic amphetamines around the country .
Patched Hells
Angels members on bikes also used to ‘‘ buzz ’’ picketing workers at factories .
Others rode shotgun in trucks , carrying shotguns , and another bikie is said to have threatened the family of a union official during a dispute at the Smithfield plant in Sydney .
Cadpro has a new owner since its former owner was jailed , but , at its Campbellfield headquarters recently , a number of Visy Recycling trailers were still parked along with a prime mover emblazoned ‘‘ Angel Express ’ ’ .
Loading Former employees say that , bikies aside , Pratt employed a number of shady characters .
Documents from the 1990s refer to ordering one of these employees , Tony Millane , to ‘‘ do some espionage ’’ on business opponents .
Hancock says that Millane , a petty criminal for more than three decades with a rap sheet that included arrests for offences involving loaded firearms , robbery and attempted incest , once threatened him with a pistol .
Hancock sacked him but Pratt re-hired him ‘‘ because he knew too much ’’ .
After Hancock quit Visy in 1993 he says he was beaten up and robbed by three thugs who warned him in a dark carpark one night , ‘‘ Do n’t cause trouble for the Pratts ’ ’ .
The roles of other operatives such as Steve ‘‘ The Colonel ’’ Zagon , a former military intelligence officer , were harder to work out .
‘‘ There was an ex-SAS guy , ’’ remembers one former executive .
‘‘ Dick used him all the time to follow people .
Really underhand shit . ’’
A Melbourne business figure remembers that Amcor regularly swept its offices for bugs it believed were installed by people working for Visy .
‘‘ There was a fair bit of lead lining put on the walls and ceilings , yes , ’’ he says .
A number of these people , including Zagon , worked for the Howard government during the waterfront dispute , carrying out the heavy - handed , union - busting strategy devised by another key Pratt executive - on - loan , Dr Stephen Webster .
The former spooks were also sometimes used to enforce the loyalty that Pratt prized in his employees .
Those who strayed outside the organisation were offered large salaries to stay , or large retainers to keep their silence if they left , according to one with personal experience .
Those who did not fall into line , however , might be followed and intimidated or , in Hancock ’s case , bashed up and dragged through the courts .
‘‘ It was like Hotel California — you could check out any time but you could never leave , ’’ Hancock says .
Some of these allegations were investigated by authorities .
A National Crime Authority probe of Pratt ’s dubious 1980s business dealings with John Elliott soon widened to look at some of these other areas , prompting Pratt to say in 1995 he felt he was ‘‘ living in a Nazi state ’ ’ .
The NCA investigation eventually led nowhere , partly because of a widespread Pratt practice of shredding compromising documents .
A former investigator has confirmed that the raid of Visy ’s Rialto head office in 1994 was prompted by evidence of document destruction .
Former executives interviewed by The Sunday Age confirm also that they ’d witnessed staff feeding the shredding machines .
A spokesman for Visy said the company had no interest in commenting on any of these allegations .
PRATT never explained to the world what were the demons that drove him , provided his boundless energy , prompted the vicious anger he spat out at family , friends and employees .
He could not explain why he was so hugely generous with his philanthropy , nor what sent him spinning into the arms of crooks and prostitutes .
His philosophy , such as it was , was boiled down into a number of aphorisms .
George Bernard Shaw ’s
‘‘ All progress depends on the unreasonable man ’’ was a favourite .
But there were others : ‘‘ Never give anything without getting something in return ’’ explains , in part , his philanthropy .
Others included , ‘‘ Love your customers , hate your competitors and screw your suppliers . ’’
And ‘‘ The end justifies the means .
Money solves everything . ’’
‘‘ He really believed it , ’’ says one former associate .
‘‘ He really did believe it .
And he had to keep proving things because of his background and ethnicity and all those other reasons . ’’
‘‘ He suffered a massive inferiority complex , ’’ says another Melbourne business figure .
‘‘ Why he could n’t be as big as Elliott , do this takeover or that deal . ’’
One respected Melbourne business figure remembers congratulating Pratt on being appointed the foundation chancellor of Swinburne University of Technology .
Pratt was dismissive : ‘‘ No , no , I just bought it .
It ’s only money , ’’ he had said .
In the end , though , money could buy neither respect nor happiness .
According to Hancock , ‘‘ Dick just worked out that the darker side of life was better ’’ .
The transition to 64 - bit computing has accelerated with the release of Windows 7 .
Figures published by Microsoft today claim that nearly half of Windows 7 installations — 46 percent — are using 64 - bit versions of the operating system .
This represents a huge upswing in 64 - bit adoption ; Windows Vista , in comparison , had only 11 percent of its users running the 64 - bit version .
The benefits of 64 - bit Windows vary ; for some users they will be substantial , for others , nonexistent .
The 64 - bit versions of the operating system have reliable access to larger amounts of physical memory than their 32 - bit counterparts .
64 - bit software similarly has easy access to more system resources .
These factors can provide a substantial performance boost to heavy workloads like databases , but for other workloads — including common desktop tasks such as word processing or Web browsing — there is little advantage to be had .
64 - bit Windows software is potentially more secure than 32 - bit software .
64 - bit Windows can make systems such as ASLR stronger , as known ASLR - defeating techniques depend on the relatively small amount of memory that 32 - bit programs have available .
It 's these security benefits which prompted Intel 's migration to 64 - bit Windows 7 ; the chipmaker , which famously skipped Windows Vista , has expressed no concerns over migration to Redmond 's latest platform .
64 - bit variants of the x86 processors that power Windows machines have been around since 2003 , but the popularity of 64 - bit software has lagged behind the processor availability .
This started to change with Windows Vista .
Driver certification for that OS required submission of 64 - bit drivers in addition to the far more common 32 - bit drivers , meaning that hardware manufacturers stopped treating the 64 - bit version as a second - class citizen .
Similarly , software certification requires vendors to test and support their software on 64 - bit Windows .
Though it seems likely that 64 - bit sales will overtake 32 - bit at some point during the course of Windows 7's life , 32 - bit software is n't going away anytime soon .
A lot of software is still 32 - bit , with little to gain from a conversion .
One particular sticking point is Web browsers and their plugins ; though the security benefits of 64 - bit software are particularly desirable in a Web browser , important plugins like Flash have no 64 - bit version .
And although Internet Explorer has had a 64 - bit version for many years , other Windows browsers have not yet followed suit .
This could change soon , as Firefox 4 may include a 64 - bit Windows version .
As slow as it is , the 64 - bit migration is happening faster than the switch from 16 - to 32 - bit software .
Intel 's first 32 - bit processor was released in 1985 ; it was n't until Windows 95 , a decade later , that there was any mainstream 32 - bit operating system , and even that was a hybrid between 16 - and 32 - bit code .
Not until Windows XP 's release in 2001 did PC users move wholesale to a pure 32 - bit platform .
I 've written several times that the " openness " argument made against Apple 's iPhone in general , and by Google against Apple in particular is overblown and often disingenuous .
Sure , other smartphones might theoretically be more open at the platform level , but when it comes down to manufacturers and carriers , the end user - facing openness is just not there .
We 've already been through how manufacturers can lock down ROMs , carriers can lock out side - loading and add bloat - ware , and Google themselves can remote kill apps .
But we have n't had real look at just how much of the " completely open " platforms are , you know , completely open .
Enter Robert Werlinger from sibling site PreCentral .net who is at OSCON 2010 and sat in for a talk by the Free Software Foundation on why open - source does n't always mean open on smartphones .
Just how proprietary are the implementations of Android ?
After examining what is n’t open source and why in contemporary Android phones ( and on HTC G1 ) , Williamson set out to see just how open he could make his phone while still maintaining phone functionality .
After stripping all of the proprietary software with the exception of the modem firmware and audio routing software , he was left without : A camera , GPS , WIFI , Sensors , 3D , Bluetooth , Market .
A surprising lack of functionality in an operating system that is presumably so “ open ” .
Indeed , Android employs a similar licensing structure to MeeGo and Symbian : The Kernel is GPL and everything is Apache 2.0 , allowing for proprietary modifications .
Bottom line , on a truly " open " Android device , you can't even make a phone call .
Eric Schmidt's " completely open " is hyperbole when it comes to end users , even power end users .
Robert sums it up nicely :
The biggest problem from an enthusiast standpoint is that folks like Cyanogen will continue to exist in a legal grey area , as members of the “ open handset alliance ” continue to perpetuate the myth that its platform has anything to do with openness .
Apple 's iOS is based on the open - source , BSD - licensed Mach kernel and network layers wrapped up in a completely proprietary UI and totally closed and controlled app platform .
That has advantages and disadvantages and every user -- from hax0r girl to soccer dad -- will have to decide what better suits their needs .
Any company that thinks they can re-frame the discussion around false " openness " is in for a surprise , however , just as any user switching platforms over philosophy is going to get burned .
That 's why philosophy be left out of the discussion and smartphone platforms and their backers compete with each other based on technology .
In that arena , Google and their Android partners are catching up fast ( even overtaking depending on who you asked ) .
In that arena , Microsoft 's newly reborn , and proprietary Windows Phone 7 is just as interesting as Palm 's extremely open if not open - source , and newly acquired webOS , RIM 's ultra locked down , uber - secure BlackBerry as much competition as Nokia 's slowly opening Symbian .
Do n't believe me ?
Believe the FSF .
Just like cake , " open smartphones " are a lie .
Robert D. Hershey Jr. has the Times obituary :
Daniel Schorr , whose aggressive reporting over 70 years as a respected broadcast and print journalist brought him into conflict with censors , the Nixon administration and network superiors , died Friday in Washington .
He was 93 .
His death was announced by National Public Radio , where he had been a commentator for two decades .
Mr. Schorr , a protégé of Edward R. Murrow at CBS
News , initially made his mark at CBS as a foreign correspondent , most notably in the Soviet Union .
He opened the network ’s Moscow bureau in 1955 and became well enough acquainted with the Soviet leader Nikita S. Khrushchev — whom he called “ the most fascinating person I ever met ” — to secure for “ Face the Nation ” the first television interview for which Khrushchev ever sat .
( He had never even done one for Soviet television . )
At the end of 1957 Mr. Schorr went home for the holidays and was denied readmission to the Soviet Union .
His 23 - year career at CBS was cut short in 1976 when , in what Mr. Schorr later called “ the most tumultuous experience of my career , ” he obtained a copy of a suppressed House of Representatives committee report on highly dubious activities by the Central Intelligence Agency .
He showed a draft on television and discussed its contents , but when neither of CBS ’s book subsidiaries was willing to publish the document , produced by the House Select Committee on Intelligence under Otis G. Pike , a New York Democrat , Mr. Schorr provided it — anonymously , he vainly hoped — to The Village Voice .
This led to threats requiring police protection , to investigations by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Congress , and to Mr. Schorr ’s being relieved of reporting duty .
Although editorial and public opinion subsequently swung in his favor and Mr. Schorr , who came to be seen as a beleaguered reporter defending a principle , became a popular speaker on the lecture circuit , what he called his “ love - hate affair ” with CBS News was ended .

Under the rules , companies like Danone must satisfy the authorities claims are scientifically proven
Health foods would be nothing without the claims they make on the packaging .
But some claims might soon vanish , due to a European regulation which demands that health food companies come up with the scientific evidence to back their labelling .
The regulation extends to a vast range of products - from multi-vitamins and slimming pills to margarine and yoghurt .
Of the claims so far considered , the overwhelming majority have been rejected , leaving many health food manufacturers with a very bad case of indigestion .
Probiotics scrutinised
The Nutrition and Health Claims Regulation was adopted back in 2006 " to ensure that consumers are not misled by unsubstantiated , exaggerated or untruthful claims about foodstuffs " , but it is only now that it is beginning to bite .
European Union member states have together submitted over 44,000 ' general function ' health claims on the part of manufacturers .
These were boiled down to 4,637 claims for consideration by the Parma - based European Food Safety Authority ( EFSA ) .
Of around 900 claims so far examined , a massive 80 % have been rejected .
CLAIMS REJECTED apple cider vinegar can improve bowel movement
the horsetail plant ( Equisetum arvense L. ) can help maintain normal hair
green tea is good for blood pressure , cholesterol levels , bones , teeth and eyesight or that it works as an antioxidant
cranberry juice can reduce the risk of urinary tract infection in women
the probiotic Lactobacillus plantarum supports the immune system
sugar - free chewing gum can reduce dental plaque
glucosamine can reduce the risk of osteoarthritis
Further claims have been submitted from individual manufacturers seeking opinions on proprietary products .
There are also separate claims relating to disease reduction and children 's development .
Again , most applications have been rejected .
Among those claims thrown out ( see box ) is the suggestion that green tea is good for blood pressure , cholesterol levels , bones and teeth or that it works as an antioxidant , reducing the effects of ageing .
Also reeling is the lucrative probiotic drinks and yoghurts industry , with claims linked to a host of probiotic strains rejected .
Probiotic giant Yakult still awaits EFSA 's final judgement , having withdrawn an earlier application .
Danone ( maker of Actimel and Activia ) has withdrawn applications twice and expressed its frustration with the process .
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Neil Bowdler reports on the stringent new health foods rules
Ioannis Misopoulos , director general of the International Probiotics Association ( IPA ) , is openly hostile .
" It can take three years to get these kinds of human studies together but in the meantime the claims are going to be wiped away , " he said .
" The regulation is killing this industry and the job losses are already being felt . "
Threat to brand names
The regulation also bans the practice of claiming a product will result in a quantifiable weight loss , so out will go the promise of losing so many pounds in a week , as will " claims referring to recommendations of individual doctors " .
The regulation does not just touch the claims in the ad or in the small print - it also extends to the product names if they are deemed to constitute a claim , even if established brands will have 15 years to comply .
What then for such well known names as Slim Fast ?
People will probably start buying in from unregulated countries especially via the internet Jenny Baillie , Health food company Power Health
According to Helen Darracott , a regulatory expert with the UK healthcare trade body , the Proprietary Association of Great Britain , a name change may be on the cards .
" The actual name of the product is a health claim in effect - it slims and it does it quickly - and therefore it's a claim which talks about the rate of weight loss so this will actually fall foul of the regulation . "
Not surprisingly , the process has left many manufacturers here in the UK angry .
Some say EFSA is demanding the same kind of clinical evidence which prescription medicines would require .
" EFSA is rejecting most of the proposed food supplement claims , " says Jenny Baillie of the York - based health foods company Power Health , " even established claims like cranberry for urinary tract health , which will mean that there will be no information on packs for the consumer to assess what the product is supposed to do . "
She believes the regulation may even drive consumers into buying from less reputable sources .
" People will probably start buying in from unregulated countries especially via the internet and we could well end up with customers less protected than they were right at the start of this process . "
Other larger companies are keeping their silence for now .
Yakult and Holland & Barrett declined requests for interviews on the effects the regulation may have on their business .
Unilever , which produces such health brands as Flora pro.activ and Slim Fast , also declined an interview request , but released a statement defending Slim Fast and saying the new regulation would provide a scientific standard and enable " consumers to make informed and meaningful choices they can trust " .
Second chance
What is certain is that this process is set to run and run .
EFSA is still to rule on thousands of claims , with the next batch of opinions due in late September .
Even when claims are rejected , it may be some time before companies actually drop them from their packaging .
EFSA 's opinions must first be adopted by the European Commission and companies will have six months to comply .
The European Commission has now also signalled companies may be given a second chance to submit rejected claims , after acknowledging that this is a new process with which many companies have struggled .
EFSA spokeswoman Lucia de Luca says insufficient scientific evidence - or inadequate information - is to blame for the most of the rejected claims .
" For example , antioxidant claims did not provide actual evidence of an effect on the protection of DNA , proteins and lipids from oxidative damage - which would be considered to be a beneficial physiological effect , " she says .
" To carry out a scientific evaluation of the health claim , the relationship between the benefit claimed and the substance or product has to be clear . "
Consumer Reports :
By the Way , the iPhone 4 is Also the Best Smartphone on the Market
Well , this is ironic .
Apple ’s ( AAPL ) iPhone 4 , the smartphone that Consumer Reports says it can’t recommend , is also the one ranked highest in its latest ratings .
The device scored 76 out of 100 points –two points ahead of its closest rivals , the iPhone 3Gs and the HTC Evo 4G ( click on image above to enlarge ) .
The product evaluation agency rated the iPhone 4 “ Excellent ” in its display , navigation , Web browsing , multimedia and battery life categories , “ Very Good ” in phoning and messaging and “ Good ” in voice quality .
In short , the iPhone 4 is hands - down the best smartphone available today , but Consumer Reports advises against buying it .

The FIA has announced that its World Motor Sport Council is to consider whether Ferrari should face further sanctions for the team orders controversy at the German Grand Prix , after the team was fined $ 100,000 for its actions .
Fernando Alonso was handed victory at Hockenheim after his Ferrari team - mate Felipe Massa sacrificed the lead on lap 48 - soon after the team had told the Brazilian that he was slower than the car behind him .
Although Ferrari has insisted that it did not issue a team order , and merely provided Massa with information , the race stewards after the German GP had a different opinion .
After speaking to team principal Stefano Domenicali , team manager Massimo Rivola , plus Alonso and Massa to examine the events of the afternoon , the race stewards decided that the regulations had been broken .
In a statement issued on Sunday night , the FIA stated that a breach of Article 39.1 , which bans team orders , and 151c , which relates to bringing the sport into disrepute , had been committed .
It said that the penalty would be : " Fine $ 100,000 .
The case will also be referred to the FIA World Motorsport Council for further consideration . "
Alonso said after the race that the drivers were both simply doing what is best for the team .
" We tried to do our race , we tried to do as good as we can , " said Alonso , who scored his second win of the year .
" We are professional drivers and we try to work as a team and we try to do the best we can every day . "
( CNN ) -- Sajjad Mohammedie Ashtiani travels to a Tabriz jail in Iran every Monday to see his mother .
And for 15 minutes each week , he speaks to his mother , Sakine Mohammedie Ashtiani , through the prison glass that divides them .
Neither mother nor son ever know if the visit will be their last .
Convicted of adultery in 2006 , Ashtiani has been sentenced to be stoned to death for her alleged crime .
Originally sentenced to 99 lashes for her alleged " illicit relationship outside of marriage , " Ashtiani endured that punishment in front of her then 17 - year - old son .
" The authorities asked if I wanted to wait outside .
I said no .
I could not leave my mother alone . "
Sajjad says it is a day he will never forget .
But , he says , that day he thought the worst was over .
" I was thinking , OK , they hit her , now it 's finished .
They told me this process was finished .
She 's done .
She 's free to go . "
But then a judges ' panel in Tabriz suspected Ashtiani of being involved in her husband 's murder and re-opened her case .
She was cleared of the murder charges , but the panel re-examined Ashtiani 's adultery sentence , and based on unspecified " judges ' knowledge , " decided she should be put to death for the alleged affair .
" At that time it should have been finished .
They should have punished her only once , " says her son .
" Her documents say she is innocent .
She paid for the crime five years ago . "
Human rights activist Mina Ahadi , herself forced to flee a death sentence in Iran almost 30 years ago , has also taken up Ashtiani 's cause , working with Sajjad and his sister Farideh to get their message out .
She says pressure from outside Iran can make a difference .
" Legally , it 's all over , and we have no chance .
It 's a done deal .
Sakine can be stoned at any minute .
But we have experienced again and again that when we organize events world - wide , when we protest world - wide , and in particular when we contact European governments and these governments put pressure on the Islamic regime in Iran , sometimes we have a chance . "
So far , there has been no response from Iranian officials about the Ashtiani case .
And with all legal appeals virtually exhausted , Sajjad says the Tabriz court has told him there is only one thing that can stop his mother 's imminent execution .
" They told me if supreme leader Ayatollah Khamenei ... or Judiciary Chairman Sadegh Larijani grant my mother a letter of pardon , she will go free . "
Sajjad says he traveled to Tehran six times to obtain that letter , but has been unable to gain an audience with either man .
But he refuses to give up .
He is turning to the international community in hopes the Iranian government will hear his voice .
" It is crucial I tell these men what I have to say .
" Dear Mr. Khamenei , Mister Ahmadinejad , and Mister Larijani :
" All I ask for is a letter .
I want a letter for my dear mother .
Please write this letter of pardon because she is innocent , 100 percent innocent .
If you do not have respect for what I am saying , just take a look at her file .
You will see she is innocent .
" To the people of the world , I want to say , for this situation we are in : Help us .
Whoever can tell the government to stop this , please do .
If you can pressure Ayatollah Khamenei or Sadegh Larijani to give my family a letter , please get them to send it to us . "
Sajjad knows he is taking a risk by speaking out so publicly , but says he is not afraid for his own safety .
" I am just fighting for what is right , " he says .
" My mother is a housewife , a good person , a caring mother , " Sajjad says .
And she has grown weary of what seems to be a punishment without end .
On his last visit with her she told him , " I ca n't stay in this prison any longer . "
And so Sajjad and his sister Farideh are reaching out in any way they can to try and save their mother 's life .
In their open letter to the international community circulated on websites , Facebook pages and through human rights organizations late last week their anguish is clear .
" Today we stretch out our hands to the people of the whole world , " the letter reads .
" It is now five years that we have lived in fear and in horror , deprived of motherly love .
Is the world so cruel that it can watch this catastrophe and do nothing about it ?
" We resort to the people of the world , no matter who you are and where in the world you live .
Help to prevent this nightmare from becoming reality .
Save our mother .
" We are unable to explain the anguish of every moment , every second of our lives .
Words are unable to articulate our fear . "
CNN 's Ben Brumfield contributed to this report .
Rob Carnell , global strategist at ING , said the Obama fiscal boost peaked in the first few months of this year .
It will swing from a net stimulus of 2 pc of GDP in 2010 to a net withdrawal of 2 pc in 2011 .
" This is very substantial fiscal drag .
On top of this the US Treasury is talking of a ' Just War ' against the banks , which will further crimp lending .
It is absolutely the wrong moment to do this . "
Whenever someone mentions horrible , rapey , sadistic romance novel heroes , Catherine Coulter 's first historical romance comes up .
Obviously , we had to check it out .
And boy , this book is no joke .
The Hero : Anthony Welles , Earl of Clare , a handsome , ruthless nobleman of 34 .
In addition to his British lands , the Earl holds and Italian title and an estate in Genoa .
He 's also had all kinds of dealings with pirates and brigands , including some pirate king , with whom he had a wager that he could n't bring some woman in the harem " to pleasure " ... anyway , it 's not important .
Suffice it to say , he 's a legendary lover , adventurer , horseman , sea-captain , businessman and man-about - town .
He could have any woman in the world !
However , he 's obsessed with ...
Our Heroine : Cassandra " Cassie " Brougham is a stunningly beautiful , high - spirited 18 - year - old noblewoman who loves flouting convention , sailing , and swimming in the sea .
She 's grown up not far from the earl .

The Plot : [ Spoiler Alert ]
Cassie has been in love all her life with a dashing soldier named Edward .
When he comes back from the wars , much petting ensues , manhoods become engorged , lusts are unsated , and they decide to marry .
However , on the eve of their wedding , Cassie is kidnapped while sailing by the Earl of Clare , who takes her aboard his yacht , The Cassandra .
Turns out he was obsessed with her late mother , has been grooming Cassie all her life to be his wife , and is determined no one else shall have her .
( " I 've never known a man to raise his own wife , " his crusty Scottish manservant tells him , somewhat admiringly . )
He rapes her , repeatedly .
Like , unambigous , tearful , painful , she 's - tied - down raping .
Of course , by the next time it happens her traitorous body responds to him , and then she can't help herself from having sex with him constantly .
At one point , in a scene ripped right from the pages of Georgette Heyer 's Devil 's Cub if Devil 's Cub were awful , she shoots the earl and tries to escape .
Then she feels bad about it .
Oh , and there 's also some part where she demands the earl give her a lashing as he would any of his men over some minor infraction ; this , you see , demonstrates her courage and strength of character .
They arrive in Genoa , where all the earl 's servants treat her with contempt because she 's his mistress .
They have a lot of sex .
When Cassie gets pregnant , an ex-mistress of the earl 's and his jealous half - brother plot to get her out of the way ; she is brutally and graphically gang - raped .
After the earl breaks it up and she recovers and is starting to get serious Stockholm Syndrome , she runs across a bunch of letters that inform her her trusted companion had been corresponding with the earl for years and helping plan her abduction .
For some reason this - rather than the rape , the kidnapping , the letting her family think she 's dead or putting her in a position where her life is endangered - is the Great Betrayal that she cannot stand .
She gets some ship to take her to New York , where her original fiance is fighting in the Revolutionary War .

Once in New York , the ex-fiance , who by this point is obviously wrong for her and uptight and does n't really love her for herself , kind of rapes her .
They plan to get married .
Except , oh yeah , she 's pregnant with the earl 's baby and Edward has been sleeping with some
Tory girl , because that 's how everyone carried on in the 18th Century .
Cassie realizes she can't go through with it , which is fine because then the earl shows up in New York .
He and Edward have a swordfight ( also a straight - up Devil 's Cub ripoff ) , which Cassie breaks up .
Everyone is happy .
Love is confessed , a few plotters are killed ( because in case you 've forgotten that whole gang - rape thing needs to be tied up ) , and all 's well that ends well .

This is a close - up view of the 14th century B.C.E. clay tablet fragment discovered in Jerusalem .

A tiny clay fragment - dating from the 14th century B.C.E. - that was found in excavations outside Jerusalem 's Old City walls contains the oldest written document ever found in Jerusalem , say researchers at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem .
The find , believed to be part of a tablet from a royal archives , further testifies to the importance of Jerusalem as a major city in the Late Bronze Age , long before its conquest by King David , they say .
The clay fragment was uncovered recently during sifting of fill excavated from beneath a 10th century B.C.E. tower dating from the period of King Solomon in the Ophel area , located between the southern wall of the Old City of Jerusalem and the City of David to its south .
Details of the discovery appear in the current issue of the Israel Exploration Journal .
Excavations in the Ophel have been conducted by Dr. Eilat Mazar of the Hebrew University Institute of Archaeology .
Funding for the project has been provided by Daniel Mintz and Meredith Berkman of New York , who also have provided funds for completion of the excavations and opening of the site to the public by the Israel Antiquities Authority , in cooperation with the Israel Nature and Parks Authority and the Company for the Development of East Jerusalem .
The sifting work was led by Dr. Gabriel Barkay and Zachi Zweig at the Emek Zurim wet - sieving facility site .
The fragment that has been found is 2x2.8 centimeters in size and one centimeter thick .
Dated to the 14th century B.C.E. , it appears to have been part of a tablet and contains cuneiform symbols in ancient Akkadian ( the lingua franca of that era ) .
The words the symbols form are not significant in themselves , but what is significant is that the script is of a very high level , testifying to the fact that it was written by a highly skilled scribe that in all likelihood prepared tablets for the royal household of the time , said Prof.
Wayne Horowitz , a scholar of Assyriology at the Hebrew University Institute of Archaeology .
Horowitz deciphered the script along with his former graduate student Dr. Takayoshi Oshima , now of the University of Leipzig , Germany .
Tablets with diplomatic messages were routinely exchanged between kings in the ancient Near East , Horowitz said , and there is a great likelihood , because of its fine script and the fact it was discovered adjacent to in the acropolis area of the ancient city , that the fragment was part of such a " royal missive . "
Horowitz has interpreted the symbols on the fragment to include the words " you , " " you were , " " later , " " to do " and " them . "
The most ancient known written record previously found in Jerusalem was the tablet found in the Shiloah water tunnel in the City of David area during the 8th century B.C.E. reign of King Hezekiah .
That tablet , celebrating the completion of the tunnel , is in a museum in Istanbul .
This latest find predates the Hezekiah tablet by about 600 years .
The fragment found at the Ophel is believed to be contemporary with the some 380 tablets discovered in the 19th century at Amarna in Egypt in the archives of Pharaoh Amenhotep IV ( Akhenaten ) , who lived in the 14th century B.C.E .
The archives include tablets sent to Akhenaten by the kings who were subservient to him in Canaan and Syria and include details about the complex relationships between them , covering many facets of governance and society .
Among these tablets are six that are addressed from Abdi-Heba , the Canaanite ruler of Jerusalem .
The tablet fragment in Jerusalem is most likely part of a message that would have been sent from the king of Jerusalem , possibly Abdi-Heba , back to Egypt , said Mazar .
Examination of the material of the fragment by Prof. Yuval Goren of Tel Aviv University , shows that it is from the soil of the Jerusalem area and not similar to materials from other areas , further testifying to the likelihood that it was part of a tablet from a royal archive in Jerusalem containing copies of tablets sent by the king of Jerusalem to Pharaoh Akhenaten in Egypt .
Mazar says this new discovery , providing solid evidence of the importance of Jerusalem during the Late Bronze Age ( the second half of the second century B.C.E. ) , acts as a counterpoint to some who have used the lack of substantial archeological findings from that period until now to argue that Jerusalem was not a major center during that period .
It also lends weight to the importance that accrued to the city in later times , leading up to its conquest by King David in the 10th century B.C.E. , she said .

There was a time when the first thing I did when I got to work every day was to look at the previous day ’s revenue figures .
At 6:30 in the morning .
Now , the first thing I do every day is walk around Tierra Madre Horse Sanctuary and make sure that 34 horses are spending a comfortable , quiet night .
I toss a little hay to a few of them and my day begins .
At 3 in the morning .
Three hundred and sixty five days a year .
Tierra Madre , in Cave Creek , Ariz. , is one of hundreds of facilities that have sprung up in recent years to accommodate the thousands of once - homeless horses .
To many , the alternative is certain death at a meat - packing plant in Canada or Mexico .
I decided a few years ago that I was n’t really happy in the corporate world .
There was no fulfillment .
I grew up around horses and remembered those as the best times in my life .
So I went back to the beginning and started over .
If horses made me happy as a kid , maybe I could make them happy as an adult .
The result is a “ forever home ” to more than 30 previously unwanted , neglected , injured or abused horses .
Horses of all sizes and breeds have found their way here .
The one thing they all have in common is that they had nowhere else to go and are now living out their lives in a happy , healthy , loving home .
Take M’Stor , who had sustained a broken kneecap during a race at Phoenix ’ Turf Paradise .
The choices were to find him a home where he could receive the medical care and rehabilitation he needed or be sent to slaughter .
I welcomed him with open arms .
M’Stor was only 3 years old , with his entire life ahead of him .
When he limped off the trailer I said , ” Dude , you ’re home for good . ”
He ’s since fully recovered and the picture of good health .
Every evening , I go see him and we stand there , him resting his head on my shoulder , my arms around his neck , both thanking the universe for bringing us together .
I was in the news media business for nearly two decades and was one of the founders of USA Today .
It was a tremendously exciting time in my life , and I would n’t trade it for anything .
I spent a stint at Turner Broadcasting , where I developed the marketing platform for the 1998 Goodwill Games .
I ’ve produced college football bowl games and major festivals and concerts .
I ’ve published magazines and newspapers .
But none of that compares with bringing a horse all the way back from a devastating injury or watching a field full of horses romping around like a bunch of school kids or just standing quietly , sharing secrets only the two of us know .
My biggest challenge ?
Keeping enough money coming in to pay the bills .
We ’re a non-profit organization and depend entirely on donations .
I ’m confident , though .
Horses hold a special place in the collective soul of America .
People will come through for the horses .
I hope .
And now I ’m off to wrap another leg , dole out some more medicine , throw out some more hay , or scratch another neck .
I would n’t trade this for the world .

( PhysOrg.com ) -- MIT researchers have demonstrated the first laser built from germanium that can produce wavelengths of light useful for optical communication .
It ’s also the first germanium laser to operate at room temperature .
Unlike the materials typically used in lasers , germanium is easy to incorporate into existing processes for manufacturing silicon chips .
So the result could prove an important step toward computers that move data -- and maybe even perform calculations -- using light instead of electricity .
But more fundamentally , the researchers have shown that , contrary to prior belief , a class of materials called indirect - band - gap semiconductors can yield practical lasers .
As chips ’ computational capacity increases , they need higher - bandwidth connections to send data to memory .
But conventional electrical connections will soon become impractical , because they ’ll require too much power to transport data at ever higher rates .
Transmitting data with lasers — devices that concentrate light into a narrow , powerful beam — could be much more power - efficient , but it requires a cheap way to integrate optical and electronic components on silicon chips .
Chip assembly is a painstaking process in which layers of different materials are deposited on a wafer of silicon , and patterns are etched into them .
Inserting a new material into this process is difficult : it has to be able to chemically bond to the layers above and below it , and depositing it must be possible at the temperatures and in the chemical environments suitable to the other materials .
The materials used in today ’s lasers , such as gallium arsenide , are “ all tough fits , ” says Tremont Miao , a marketing director at Massachusetts - based Analog Devices Semiconductor .
“ They ’re all challenging integrations . ”
As a consequence , the lasers have to be constructed separately and then grafted onto the chips , which is more expensive and time - consuming than building them directly on silicon would be .
Moreover , gallium arsenide is much more expensive than silicon in the first place .
Integrating germanium into the manufacturing process , however , is something that almost all major chip manufacturers have already begun to do , since the addition of germanium increases the speed of silicon chips .
“ We and lots of other people know how to do that , ” Miao says .
Unchanneled energies
Gallium arsenide , silicon , and germanium are all examples of semiconductors , the type of material used in virtually all modern electronics .
Lasers made from semiconductors convert the energy of electrons — particles of charge — into photons — particles of light .
Semiconductors come in two varieties : those with direct band gaps , like gallium arsenide , and those with indirect band gaps , like germanium and silicon .
According to Jurgen Michel , principal research associate in the Electronic Materials Research Group and primary investigator on the germanium - laser project , “ There was an opinion in the scientific area that indirect - band - gap semiconductors will never lase ” — that is , produce laser light .
“ That ’s just what you teach in classes , ” says Lionel Kimerling , the Thomas Lord Professor of Materials Science and Engineering , who leads the group .
In a semiconductor crystal , an excited electron — one that ’s had energy added to it — will break free and enter the so - called conduction band , where it can move freely around the crystal .
But in fact , an electron in the conduction band can be in one of two states .
If it ’s in the first state , and it falls out of the conduction band , it will release its extra energy as a photon .
If it ’s in the second state , it will release its energy in other ways , such as heat .
In direct - band - gap materials , the first state — the photon - emitting state — is a lower - energy state than the second state ; in indirect - band - gap materials , it ’s the other way around .
An excited electron will naturally occupy the lowest - energy state it can find .
So in direct - band - gap materials , excited electrons tend to go into the photon - emitting state , and in indirect - band - gap materials , they do n’t .
(a) In a semiconductor crystal , an excited electron — one with added energy — will leap from the valence band ( green ) to the conduction band ( red ) , where it can move freely around the crystal .
In the conduction band , it will occupy the lowest - energy state it can find ( right - hand well ) .
In an indirect - band - gap material like germanium , the momentum of the lowest - energy state is misaligned with that of the valence band ( yellow and black arrows ) .
As a result , the electron will not emit a photon when it loses energy .
( b ) MIT researchers fill up the lower - energy state with extra electrons from phosphorous atoms , which they add to the germanium .
( c ) When an electron leaps into the conduction band , it leaves behind a “ hole ” in the valence band .
The researchers inject pairs of electrons and holes into the germanium .
( d)
When the injected electrons find the lower - energy state occupied , they spill over into the other state ; realigned with their holes , they release their extra energy as photons .
Bridging the gap
In a forthcoming paper in the journal Optics Letters , Kimerling , Michel and three other researchers in the group — postdoc Jifeng Liu , the lead author on the paper , and grad students Xiaochen Sun and Rodolfo Camacho - Aguilera — describe how they coaxed excited germanium electrons into the higher - energy , photon - emitting state .
Their first strategy is a technique , common in chip manufacturing , called “ doping , ” in which atoms of some other element are added to a semiconductor crystal .
The group doped its germanium with phosphorous , which has five outer electrons .
Germanium has only four outer electrons , “ so each phosphorous gives us an extra electron , ” Kimerling says .
The extra electron fills up the lower - energy state in the conduction band , causing excited electrons to , effectively , spill over into the higher - energy , photon - emitting state .
According to the group ’s theoretical work , phosphorous doping “ works best at 1020 atoms per cubic centimeter ” of germanium , Kimerling explains .
So far , the group has developed a technique that can add 1019 phosphorous atoms to each cubic centimeter of germanium , “ and we already begin to see lasing , ” Kimerling says .
The second strategy was to lower the energy difference between the two conduction - band states so that excited electrons would be more likely to spill over into the photon - emitting state .
The researchers did that by adapting another technique common in the chip industry : they “ strained ” the germanium — or pried its atoms slightly farther apart than they would be naturally — by growing it directly on top of a layer of silicon .
Both the silicon and the germanium were deposited at high temperatures .
But silicon does n’t contract as much as germanium when it cools .
The atoms of the cooling germanium tried to maintain their alignment with the silicon atoms , so they ended up farther apart than they would ordinarily be .
Changing the angle and length of the bonds between germanium atoms also changed the energies required to kick their electrons into the conduction band .
“ The ability to grow germanium on silicon is a discovery of this group , ” says Kimerling , “ and the ability to control the strain of those germanium films on silicon is a discovery of this group . ”
“ High - speed optical circuits like germanium in general , ” says Miao .
“ That ’s a good marriage and a good combination .
So their laser research is very , very promising . ”
Miao points out that the germanium lasers need to become more power - efficient before they ’re a practical source of light for optical communications systems .
“ But on the other hand , ” he says , “ the promise is exciting , and the fact that they got germanium to lase at all is very exciting . ”

The miniskirt is again falling victim to secular Central Asian governments ' ongoing battle against the Islamic hijab .
Uzbek officials have said that Islamic hijab as well as European - style tight - fitting , revealing clothes are " alien " to Uzbek culture .
Speaking in a 25 - minute long , prime - time television program aired this week , Uzbek officials and doctors cited health and security reasons to condemn both the hijab and the miniskirt .
" Some religious extremist women carried guns under their hijab , " warned an official from the state religious committee in the television program called " Tahdid " ( " Threat " ) .
The hijab can also cause oxygen and calcium deficiencies , warned doctors .
As for women who wear miniskirts , they were advised to dress with " moderation " to prevent susceptibility to all kinds of infections and other unspecified health problems .
The long - suffering miniskirt first came under attack in neighboring Tajikistan by education authorities whose real target was the Islamic headscarf .
They officially banned the hijab and European - style clothes in schools , advocating instead Tajik traditional dress .
However , in Tajikistan it was widely believed that the miniskirt was just a smokescreen to protect the Education Ministry from all kinds of criticism .
But Tajik women could offer some advice to their Uzbek neighbors by telling them " do n't pack away your miniskirts just yet .
" Because , while a number of Tajik girls were excluded from schools and universities in the past two years for refusing to take off their hijabs , no one so far has been expelled or barred from schools for wearing miniskirts .-- Farangis Najibullah
Dubstep artist Zenodub has offered his album Cosmic EP for free download .
The album features collaborations with The Widdler , MC Zulu , and Huron .
I ’ve only listened to a few tracks so far but I must say I am highly impressed .
The entire album has a spacey feel to it which gives you the feeling that you are not just listening to music but simultaneously going on an intergalactic voyage .
Overall the album is very ambient and quite relaxing .
It takes a daring turn away from the “ filth ” that seems to be all the rage lately .
More effort was put in to the entire track as opposed to the “ drop ” that everybody has become accustomed to waiting for .
The album can be downloaded for free HERE .
Additionally , the album can be streamed here :

A new priority of the U.S. Department of Transportation is an age - old idea : Transport freight by ship for as long as possible .
The DOT is proposing designated shipping channels known as Marine Highways , and one may be leading to a port near you .
If you 've purchased any household goods in the United States recently , they probably took a familiar path from the factory to the store where you bought them : to North America on a massive cargo ship , from the ship to a railway , and finally from the rail yard to your local retailer by truck .
In many cases , freight is carried solely by truck along interstate highways .
Unfortunately , such a system is far from efficient .
It clogs our highways with multiple trucks headed in the same direction and brings pollution into our cities near freight terminals .
That 's why the Maritime Administration ( MARAD ) has proposed a system of marine highways where ships would transit goods within the United States .
Along designated corridors , ships could provide safe , environmentally friendly and reasonably quick freight transit among a network of well - situated ports .
A New Old Idea
According to MARAD Administrator Dave Matsuda , the United States is catching up with the rest of the world when it comes to marine highways .
Also known as short sea shipping , coastal trade or coastal shipping , the rivers and seas of Europe and Asia are filled with small container vessels carrying cargo within a continent .
" This is an idea that 's been around for awhile , " Matsuda said .
" The Europeans do it , and other folks do it .
For about 10 years now people have been kicking the idea around in the maritime community .
It 's to the point that it 's been joked about that the Marine Highway conference has become a cottage industry . "
When we caught up with him , Matsuda had just been sworn in as MARAD administrator .
Earlier this month , he announced an initial $ 7 million ( .pdf ) in grant funding for marine - highway projects that would primarily strengthen existing projects and proposals .
Some short sea shipping operations are already moving freight in the United States , and Matsuda wants to help them expand .
" These are the experts , these are people who have started up new markets in the past , " he said .
" They know the industry , they know the people and the operations . "
Matsuda is clear about engaging existing operators .
" The government 's role here is really to help promote these and get them up and running , " he said .
" We can talk to local transportation planners and say , ' Hey , here are some of the federal programs that help . '
There 's a limited amount of federal dollars to put towards buying cranes or barges or fixing up a port or something that we need to have up and running . "
Some projects are economic no - brainers , such as moving overweight or hazardous materials , where the cost of obtaining road permits would be prohibitive for truck shipments .
In most cases , however , in order for a project to make sense and for shippers to make money , MARAD must identify corridors with strong two - way traffic so empty ships do n't ply the waters .
A good example of such a project is a proposed Green Trade Corridor in California , a project funded by $ 30 million of TIGER funds that connects the inland agricultural areas and the Port of Oakland by a marine highway .
Currently , goods from Asia come into the port of Oakland and are trucked across the state while agricultural products are trucked in the opposite direction .
" It 's a tax on commuters , and it adds to the congestion , beats up the bridges and raises the cost of maintaining infrastructure , " said Matsuda .
" It 's not just getting the trucks off the road , but also putting people to work in some of these areas that are really devastated . "
A marine highway would move some of that traffic onto barges and guarantee two - way traffic for the company operating the barges .
A Rising Tide Lifts All Boats , Trains and Trucks
A project that promises to put people to work should n't put others out of work .
Marine highways will change rather than replace rail and truck shipments , so they seem to have gained support from groups that represent competing modes of transit .
" Marine and rail freight have co-existed since the 1830s when the rail industry began , said Holly Arthur , a representative for the Association of American Railroads .
" While shipping via water can be seen as competition , it also is a significant customer segment for railroads . "
According to Arthur , intermodal transport – the movement of shipping containers by multiple methods , such as from ship to rail – represents 21 percent of rail revenue in the United States , a figure that is continuing to grow .
If boat traffic increases , the rail industry stands to benefit .
Boats can't usually pull up to a factory loading dock or back into the parking lot of your local big - box store , so trucks are safe , too .
" At the end of the day , your shipment winds up at a port , so it has to go on a truck , " said Matsuda .
In addition , boats tend to travel more slowly than trucks ( though they usually do n't have to stop overnight for rest ) .
Often , short sea shipping services run on a weekly schedule and , said Matsuda , " It 's hard to sell a weekly service when you 're dealing with folks who need things a little more quickly . "
In a country where the majority of freight travels along marine highways , Matsuda envisions some long - haul truckers working instead in freight yards or in regional distribution , while others remain on the roads with cargo that can't wait for a slower - moving boat .
If estimates of 70 percent growth in the freight industry over the next 10 years are accurate , trucks will always be in high demand .
According to Matsuda , the U.S. DOT chose to refer to the project as Marine Highways rather than short sea shipping because the network of waterways would often be parallel to an existing interstate highway .
" We wanted to draw a parallel with the interstate system , if you can draw a highway on a map , that you can draw a waterway along the map – maybe M - 95 – and it'll get you to the same place , " he said .
One kind of freight that Matsuda thinks is best suited for the water is hazardous material .
" With hazardous materials , we only see an upside for getting them out of populated areas , " he said .
While a lot of bulk hazmat cargo is shipped , that which fits into a container is still largely transported on packed highways .
" Anything we can get off the highway is obviously a benefit , if it makes sense to do , " he said .
" It 's less gas per mile , but it also helps the people on the roads . "
Better for the Environment
In addition to transporting hazardous materials outside of populated areas , a clear advantage of short sea shipping is the reduced environmental impact of moving freight on ships .
According to Carrie Denning , a researcher at the Environmental Defense Fund who coauthored the report The Good Haul : Freight Innovations for the 21st Century , a shipping company that moves containers by sea between Port Manatee , Florida , and Brownsville , Texas , already saves 70,000 gallons of fuel on each one - way voyage compared to a comparable truck journey .
Those fuel savings translate into fewer emissions in population centers .
" One way to reduce pollution emissions in some regions will be to substitute multiple truck trips with single barge trips via coastal shipping routes that meet robust environmental performance standards , " she said .
Even with the obvious fuel savings , Denning says that marine routes could still pose serious environmental consequences .
Ports themselves are notorious for high levels of emissions from machinery used to move freight .
To truly be environmentally responsible , ports along a marine highway would have to implement solutions such as electric forklifts and yard trucks – many of which are already in place at the Port of Los Angeles .
Additionally , highways would have to be designated clear of environmentally sensitive areas .
" Coastal shipping is not a panacea , " she said .
" Depending on the highway route , there could be serious ramifications for marine life if dredging is required , if migratory patterns are disrupted , or if additional infrastructure is needed that interferes with certain marine ecosystems . "
RoRo Your Boat
A centerpiece of the European short sea shipping industry is a small freighter known as a RoRo , short for " roll on , roll off . "
While larger ships require cranes to lift containers onboard , RoRos pull straight up to a dock where trucks can drive onboard and unload freight containers .
Because they 're smaller , they do n't require channels as deep as larger ships , and can minimize the need for dredging .
" The ship literally pulls up , lays down a ramp and the trucks drive on and off it , " said Matsuda .
" From an operating standpoint , you do n't need cranes , you do n't need to pay the skilled workers – but you need people to drive the trucks on and off the ship . "
Rather than investing in the installation of cranes and other equipment at small ports , Matsuda says that RoRos could follow what he calls the " Southwest Airlines model , " after the carrier that started off flying into secondary airports .
Smaller RoRos could bypass major ports and travel through shallower waterways to inland cities .
Matsuda just saw such a system in action at the Port of Rotterdam in the Netherlands .
" It is just incredible to see these relatively small , long , thin , self - propelled ships that can carry 20 or 30 containers that kind of zip around in this massive port after the giant container ship has been offloaded , " he said .
" They go up the rivers into Europe or around the coast to other ports . "
Would such a system be possible in the United States ?
There may not be a choice .
With roadways in major cities already crammed with freight traffic and the demand for freight ever increasing , putting freight on the water may be the most sensible solution for companies that need to move goods from here to there .
Matsuda says a political climate that 's focused on creating jobs and helping the environment also will support the cause .
" Where there are corridors , the federal government will help focus attention and investments to get those services up and running , " he said .
" This is something that we think is going to go a long way . "

This year a slew of companies have launched competing Android tablet devices .
A lot of rhetoric has been spun about how Android ’s open source ecosystem gives manufacturers and consumers an advantage .
Android is open source ; it can be liberally extended to incorporate new cutting edge technologies as they emerge .
The platform will continue to evolve as the developer community works together to build innovative mobile applications .
( Open Handset Alliance )
Unfortunately , the current crop of Android tablets are n’t nurturing open source at all .
Android Tablets
With the exception of Barnes & Noble ’s Nook e-reader , a device that is n’t even really a tablet , I could n’t find a single EDIT : I found one tablet manufacturer who was complying with the minimum of their legal open source requirements under GNU GPL .
Let alone supporting community development .
EDIT 2/9 : Benmars posted in the comments that Archos have now released GPL source code for the Archos 7 Home Tablet .
This looks to be a full kernel source release for the Rockchip RK28xx SoC , and even includes includes a prebuilt linux - x86 cross -compiler toolchain .
Thank you Archos !
EDIT 31/7 : In the comments , xauieous points out that while Archos have released GPL source for the ARM11 / OMAP2 based “ Archos 5 Internet Tablet ” ( aka Archos Generation 7 ) , they are not complying with GPL for the ARM9 based “ Archos 7 Home Tablet ” .
The contents of the “ Generation 7 ” kernel tarball seem to bear this out .
Xauieous claims Rockchip are holding out on the source for the Archos 9 Home Tablet , same as Apad .
Also , personal note to Archos : Please get a less confusing naming scheme !
EDIT 28/7 : Courtesy Harald Welte @ VIA , there ’s been a source drop of kernel source for WM8505 - based tablets ( Eken M001 , M003 , Gome FlyTouch , etc. )
Some parts ( video , SD / MMC drivers ) are still binary only , Harald says he ’s talking to VIA about it .
EDIT 26/7 : Zebul posted a comment and drew my attention back to Archos ’ GPL download section .
I originally thought these were all just media player firmwares , but it turns out “ Archos Generation 7 ” means the “ Archos 5 Internet Tablet ” and this tarball is a full GPL source release .
Well done Archos !
To their detriment , the binary firmware does not contain any obvious GPL mention – and this may mean they are still in technical breach of the GPL .
The manual does n’t mention anything either .
But it ’s still streets ahead of the others .
Yay Archos !
( EDIT : I posted some details here .
Please leave a comment if I ’ve missed any tablets , or any source releases . )
What ’s this GPL ?
The GNU General Public License is a “ copyleft ” software license .
Manufacturers releasing products with GPL licensed code , like the Linux kernel that underpins Android , are required to make their changes available in source code form .
Android itself is n’t GPL .
Its open source Apache license does not mandate that source code has to be made available .
However , all Android systems include the Linux kernel at minimum , and may also include other GPL - licensed pieces of software that are not part of the base Android distribution .
GPL source releases for these kernels make it easier for developers to build alternative operating systems , Android or otherwise , to run on the tablet hardware .
It also allows improvements and changes to flow back “ upstream ” to the original software authors .
Why should consumers care ?
The average tablet buyer is n’t an open source developer .
However , having healthy open source releases means future support for these devices is guaranteed .
Currently , projects like CyanogenMod make new improvements available to old Android phones whose manufacturers have already moved on .
Similar community improvements could make new releases available on tablets , even though manufacturers are no longer supporting them .
Often , community Android releases are better than the original manufacturer ’s .
Slatedroid & ECOTOX have been releasing customised Android versions for the Eken M001 tablet which are both faster and support more features than the OEM release .
Having kernel source available can only serve to make these releases better .
For the Nook e-reader , community software releases allow you to view more ebook formats on your Nook , and even add totally unexpected features like Pandora Internet Radio .
Why should tablet manufacturers care ?
Most manufacturers seem to be stuck in the “ vendor ” mindset that their hardware should remain entirely under their control , and that anyone else working on it is a problem .
However , it seems like community development almost always adds value to the hardware by extending it and adding more features .
Especially in the tablet arena where there are no carriers to insist on platform lockdown to support their business model , an open platform does n’t seem like it carries any significant drawbacks .
Some companies , particularly the smaller Chinese ones , appear to be concerned about competitors ripping their software off into compatible hardware .
From what we ’ve seen with the Eken M001 though , it does n’t seem like source availability – especially kernel source – would do much to change the situation .
Outside of e-readers , there are n’t any companies competing on custom software anyhow : for the most part the software is vanilla Android , and competition is on performance , specifications , and especially price .
This seems to make an even bigger opportunity for a clever manufacturer to embrace community open - source development , and differentiate themselves from all the “ me too ” Android clones without incurring any actual R&D cost .
What about chipset manufacturers ?
A lot of kernel development for these devices is done by the original chipset manufacturers themselves .
For example , it seems like VIA authored and compiled the kernels found in all devices based on the WM8505 chipset ( including Eken ’s tablets and some others ..)
It seems like the same story is true for Rockchip , who make the chipset used in the iRobot APad & Moonse E-7001 .
Chipset manufacturers are n’t required to release GPL source code to the public , provided they send sources alongside any GPL software that goes to the device manufacturer .
VIA has so far chosen this path , stating all sources are released to device manufacturers ( although Eken has claimed differently at least once . )
In the case of RockChip , manufacturers claim RockChip is n’t even doing that much and are violating GPL themselves ( see first comment ) .
In addition , chipset manufacturers may sometimes author custom kernel modules or other components that are not GPL licensed at all .
For example , Samsung have a video acceleration kernel module that is included in the firmware for the SmartQ tablet range .
These components are normally not open sourced at all .
I can think of three reasons which chipset manufacturers do not embrace open source .
One is that it is simpler not to .
Another is that they charge device manufacturers for access to their SDK , and preemptively releasing source takes away that revenue stream ( although possibly at the expense of extra hardware sales . )
The last is that they are concerned about protection of their intellectual property , although this seems unnecessary given that most of their trade secrets are captured in the hardware itself , which is in turn protected by patents .
What about Google ?
Google is in an interesting position here .
On the one hand , they have worked hard to make sure that above the kernel layer Android is not GPL licensed .
This serves to calm worried manufacturers threatened by the idea of having to release source .
It seems , sadly , like a necessary step in order for Android to receive the kind of market prominence that Google wants for it .
On the other hand , it seems hypocritical for Google to tout Android ’s “ open source ” credentials when it seems so clear that most companies profiting from it are completely oblivious , maybe even antagonistic , to open source .
I think there may be things Google could do to encourage manufacturers to be more friendly ( or at least legally compliant ) with open source , without scaring them off .
An idea that springs to mind , especially now Google seem to be out of the device business , is promotion & accreditation of open source friendly manufacturers who receive extra kudos and promotion from Google in exchange for giving back to the community .
Some kind of base level accreditation for companies who do not violate GPL , and additional incentives for companies who give back extra to the community .
Where to from here ?
There are a lot more Android devices on the horizon , from a variety of manufacturers .
It is my sincere hope that , especially following the growing buzz around “ open source hardware ” , at least one chipset or device manufacturer decides to make a break from the pack and announce “ open source friendly products & manufacturing ” that includes supporting community development .
Until then , if you care about open source you may actually be better off buying an iPad than many of the devices listed above .
At least Apple comply with GPL and contribute back to the open source projects that they benefit from !
Mexico City , Mexico ( CNN ) --
Authorities in the Mexican border state of Nuevo Leon have finished excavating and are trying to identify 51 bodies they found in nine hidden mass graves , state media said .
The graves could be connected to drug gang violence , Nuevo Leon Governor Rodrigo Medina de la Cruz told the state - run Notimex news agency .
Investigators found charred remains , incinerated bone fragments and stains of fire on the ground where bodies were presumably burned in steel drums , Notimex said .
Teams from the state attorney general 's office and the Mexican army used dogs and heavy machinery in their 72 - hour search of the area , Notimex reported Saturday .
Investigators believe some of the bodies had been dumped within the past 15 days , said Alejandro Garza y Garza , Nuevo Leon attorney general .
Garza said Friday that the bodies were in an area spanning 3 hectares ( about 7 acres ) in the municipality of Juarez outside the state capital of Monterrey .
Investigators were still searching for additional graves Friday , he said , according to Notimex .
The bodies were mostly males between ages 20 and 50 , Notimex said , and many of them had tattoos .
Forensic investigators are performing DNA tests to identify the victims , Notimex reported .
Similar mass graves have been discovered in the Mexican states of Tamaulipas , Guerrero and Quintana Roo since late May .
Authorities have linked them to Mexico 's ongoing drug war .
Nuevo Leon , which borders
Texas , has seen a spike in drug violence this year due to an intensifying rivalry between former partners : the Gulf cartel and a group know as the Zetas .

The Wacom Intuos4 graphics tablet is a pressure sensitive computer input device that allows free - hand drawing , similar to traditional pencil and paper artistry .
In this review we 're going to provide an overview of the product , its features and try unleashing our creative side using Open Source graphic software with the Wacom Intuos4 .
The Intuos4 Tablet
First thing you 'll notice is a low profile design that is slim and free of obstruction .
The outer housing is constructed from plastic which makes for light weight , easy transportation .
Aesthetically the glossy finish looks beautiful , but functionally it is prone to finger prints and highlights specs of dust .
On the side control panel are eight ExpressKeys with individual LED indicators and a Touch Ring which controls up to four user - defined functions .
To the touch , the active work area feels similar to paper and is of course centered on the device , separated by only a thin bezel .
Overall size and button configuration of the unit will very depending on which model you choose as the Intuos4 comes in four different sizes , small ( $ 229 ) , medium ( $ 349 ) , large ( $ 469 ) and extra large ( $ 789 ) .
Our review model is medium , which provides an 8.8 " x 5.5 " active area and overall size of 14.6 " x 10.0 " .
Remember those " special scissors " from elementary school , the ones with green handle ?
Well those were for people like me , the classroom minority , a left handed individual .
I can't begin the explain the frustrations of dealing with right - handed devices when you 're a lefty .
But if you too are a lefty , you 'll rejoice the fact that the Wacom Intuos4 is an ambidextrous device .
Simply turn the device 180 degrees , move the detachable cable to an alternate USB port and presto , effortless right or left hand orientation in the matter of seconds .
One distinct adjustment over its predecessor ( Intuos3 ) is the grouping of ExpressKeys and addition of a Touch Ring controller .
Arranging the control cluster in one area is a huge improvement in my opinion as it transitions symmetrically for both left and right handed users .
An ExpressKey is a shortcut / modifier button you can program for different applications .
Each has a corresponding illuminated LED that will display assigned functions .
The finger - sensitive Touch Ring is a large wheel interface similar to those you 'd see on Apple products .
It allows you to control up to four different functions in each application for adjustments such as zooming , scrolling , brush size , canvas rotation , etcetera .
The active surface of the Intuos4 has some traction to it now .
Though accurate and responsive , running the pen over feels quite similar to sensory feedback you 'd experience when drawing on paper , no longer does the Wacom pen just loosely slide over the drawing area .
This is somewhat concerning , as the new granularity may affect life span ( general wear & tear ) of pen nibs .
Contour of the new pen is great .
It 's light weight , comfortable to hold and coated with a rubber grip .
There is programmable two - position rocker button and a pressure sensitive eraser on the end too .
The nib is sensitive , requiring little pressure to register a response .
With 2048 levels of pressure sensitivity it is double that of the previous Intuos model .
Included are ten interchangeable replacement nibs ( five standard nibs , one flex nib , one stroke nib , and three hard felt nibs ) which are handily stored inside the weighted pen stand .
Reminiscent of an inkwell .

Linux Compatibility
For testing I tired the Wacom Intuos4 on both Ubuntu 9.10 and the current 10.04 release using GNU image manipulation program ( GIMP ) .
As far as installation goes , the device was plug and play with interfacing working straight out of the box .
Pressure sensitivity for the Wacom pen can be adjusted directly in the GIMP application * and operated as expected .

The ExpressKey and Touch Ring are a little more tricky to get working though .
To enable this functionality , you 'll require the installation of a 3rd party driver .
Wacom 's website links directly to these drivers , but states the following disclaimer : " There is an open source 3rd party driver for Linux that supports Intuos2 , Graphire2 , Graphire3 and Cintiq as well as older Wacom tablets .
Wacom is supporting the development of this driver by providing the programmers with necessary information and sample tablets for testing .
Wacom does not control the development of the drivers , and Wacom is not responsible for any quality or performance issues or any potential harm that might occur by using one of these drivers .
All support questions or problem reports should be directed to the independent programmers . "
You may download the drivers from The Linux Wacom Project .
Just be aware that installing software from The Linux Wacom Project will require you to remove the existing linuxwacom package if your distribution has already installed one for you .
Another notable download is a gnome graphical front - end for wacom - tools package called Wacom Control Panel .
When dealing with Open Source software , we sometimes encounter unexplained complications .
I spent over an hour enabling all functionality for the device .
This of course is not attributed to the hardware , rather software or misconfiguration on my part .
The Linux Wacom Project makes a best effort to guide you though setting up your Wacom device , but I found their documentation to be inconsistent and dated .
Novice users may find the installation information confusing , but can turn to the official linuxwacom IRC channel for assistance .
Software configuration is beyond the scope of this article , so I 'd like to keep on track with reviewing the actual hardware , not the Linux software .
Numerous resources are at your disposal , just be patient if you do n't get ExpressKey and Touch Ring functions working properly first time around .
If this sounds like too much work , or if you 'd rather use an application like Adobe Photoshop CS5 for your creative work , I 'd suggest setting up a virtual machine to interface with the USB device .
For those of you with a dual boot Linux / Microsoft Windows systems , I should mention that Intuos4 products come with a no cost software bundle containing Nik Color Efex Pro , Wacom Brushes 3.0 , Adobe Photoshop Elements 8 ( Mac or PC ) , Autodesk SketchBook Express 2010 and Corel Painter Sketch Pad .
LONDON , July 17  A year after the police shot and killed a Brazilian electrician in the subway after apparently mistaking him for a suicide bomber , prosecutors said Monday that they would not charge any individual officers in connection with his death .
But the senior reviewing officer for the Crown Prosecution Service , Stephen O’Doherty , said the death of the Brazilian , 27 - year - old Jean Charles de Menezes , had been the “ cumulative result ” of police errors .
As a result , prosecutors said , the office of the Metropolitan Police commissioner , Sir Ian Blair , would be charged with failing to protect the health and safety of Mr. Menezes .
“ After the most careful consideration , I have concluded that there is insufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction against any individual police officer , ” Mr. O’Doherty said in a statement , explaining that the two officers who fired a total of seven shots at Mr. Menezes genuinely believed he was a terrorist .
To be acquitted of the health and safety charge , the police must establish that they did everything possible to protect Mr. Menezes ’s safety .
If convicted , they face a fine to which there is no limit set by law .
In a statement , they said they were “ concerned and clearly disappointed . ”
