Geneva , Switzerland -
As the Large Hadron Collider ( LHC ) nears completion , many people have worried about the implications of colliding subatomic particles at high velocities .
Some have suggested that the device could destroy the Earth by creating black holes or dangerous subatomic particles , but a new group calling themselves People for the Ethical Treatment of Hadrons ( PETH ) are worried about the health of the subatomic particles .
" You 've got these subatomic particles accelerated at great speeds for the sole purpose of being destroyed .
No one thinks of the ethical implications of this , " said Tia Aumiller who founded the group .
" There 's a limited supply of hadrons in the universe .
Do we just want to go around destroying them ?
What if we run out ?
What if the hadrons can feel pain ?
Will we look back at this hundreds of years from now and regret it ?
Kinda like we do with the killing of bacteria with antibiotics now . "
Scientists at CERN working on the LHC say this is a new one to them .
" We 've got the wackos who think we 're going to rip a hole in the universe , and the people who think our real purpose is to create a race of Dr. Manhattans , but this is just weird , " said Erich Stanhoffe who heads the LHC project .
Stanhoffe admits that no research has been done on whether hadrons can feel pain or might get sick traveling at such high speeds , but that 's only because the idea is " patently ridiculous . "

"
Dozens of people from PETH protested outside the CERN headquarters with signs reading " Do n't fark with the quark " and " Subatomic Pain is Still Pain . "
Officials at CERN do not expect the protests to delay the " end of the world ..uh ... commencement of scientific research " in October .

Primary OS
It 's changed over the years and will continue to shift , but right now I split my time about 80%/20 % Mac OS X and Windows XP .
I plan to increase my Windows time ( and get Vista into the mix ) to better serve Lifehacker readers , who are primarily Windows ( about 70 % at the moment , though this chart changes by the minute ) .
Setting up a Hardy desktop is also looking more and more tempting .
Hardware
I used to use four different computers on a regular basis , but keeping them all maintained , synced , backed up , and up to date with operating system patches became too much .
So last year I decided to simplify and pare down the machine I use for work purposes to one laptop ( so I could take it with me when I travel ) , and chose :
G/O Media may get a commission LG 75 - Inch 8K TV Buy for $ 2150 from BuyDig Use the promo code ASL250
A 15 - inch MacBook Pro to which I added a stick of memory , using Adam 's guide Boot Camp and virtualize that partition
to which I added a stick of memory , using An ancient Dell Dimension tower which I launched Lifehacker on mostly goes unused now .
For awhile I used it as a file server , but to reduce energy consumption , I decided keeping an always - on file server was overkill for the two people who live in my household .

Even though I still like keeping important files saved to my local hard drive , I 've moved most of my daily work into a Firefox tab ( which makes it easy to access from the iPhone as well ) .
I use dozens of webapps , but the primary ones are :

I also love MediaWiki and del.icio.us .
Here 's more on the apps that run Lifehacker 's virtual office .
Self Assessment
I 'm a late early adopter .
I love to try out new apps , but after reviewing thousands over the years here at Lifehacker , I think long and hard before I actually work one into my daily workflow .
I 'm a big open source advocate — to the point of a tendency toward that " tinfoil hat " free software extremist mindset — but I will ( and do ) compromise for beautiful and easy - to - use software , too .
It 's great that you can do so much in the cloud these days , but I like to store and manipulate my own data and avoid webapp lock - in as well — so , for example , I back up my Gmail account via POP .
I love tinkering with software , but I 'm not as much of a hardware DIYer as my co-editors , many of whom have built their own computers .

Primary OS
I 've been primarily operating in OS X since I built my Hackintosh , but I 'm always running VMware Fusion ( another must have ) with Windows and ( sometimes ) Ubuntu .
Hardware
I 'm using the Hackintosh as my main desktop , an aging MacBook Pro with OS X and Vista in Boot Camp , and an older Windows box that 's a dedicated Media Center back - end .
Then there 's the Xbox 360 , of course , which gets about as much tinkering time as the Media Center .

After a weekend of watching a friend regularly reboot his router while I was visiting recently , I should give credit to my router , which is intermittently either running Tomato or DD - WRT .
They 're rock solid .

I honestly split my time between Windows Vista and Ubuntu Hardy Heron ( 8.04 ) .
Up until recently , I 'd been almost exclusively running Hardy ( which I 've openly professed my fondness of ) with a wirelessly synced iPod touch , but I can't get my dual monitor setup working in Hardy , and iPhone 2.0 put a nix on the second - for now .

I 'm obviously a big fan of open source and free software , as you can probably tell from the lists above .
I chose and customized my laptop in large part for its Linux - friendliness , and I 'll always favor software and webapps that can be accessed from any computer .
In general , though , I can never leave well enough alone - a good trait in writing for this site , I 'd think - and while I 'm pretty satisfied with my current array of tools , I 'm thinking a few lower - tech , real - world productivity tools - index cards , anyone ?- could probably find a useful home somewhere in my system .

Primary OS
My primary OS is Windows XP .
I 'm usually in some state of tinkering
with OS X ( working on a Hackintosh just for kicks ) , and Linux .
I find as time goes on that with Linux I 'm less tinkering with the limited free time I have to play with it and more enjoying it .
Linux has really matured since I first installed it in 1994 .

Hardware
I used to be an avid computer builder .
As far as my primary machine for daily use goes , I usually just purchase a machine that 's on sale and throw a bunch of RAM and hard drives in it .
I do n't game much anymore , so my rig does n't need to bleed speed .
All of that said I have a ton of parts and I often strip down computers before people send them off to be recycled so I have more than enough motherboards , hard drives , etc. to build all the random projects I set my mind too .
The level of parts in my workshop has reached a saturation point actually , and it is extremely likely that my next computer will be built from them with a few newer pieces thrown in .
Peripherals
I do n't really have any peripherals that I love ... except my Logitech Trackman
Wheel .
I 've been using a Logitech Trackman for over 10 years now and I love controlling the entire movement of the mouse with just my thumb .
If Logitech announced they would no longer be producing the Trackman , I 'd go out and buy a stockpile just to be safe .
If we 're being a bit looser with definition of peripherals , I 'm quite fond of my Windows Mobile phone , the HTC Apache , it 's a rather common WM phone but I like having a device I can customize and tweak to my heart 's content .
I frequently use the BuildOS program from PPCGeeks.com to rebuild my entire phone and try new things .

Webapps
The only web apps I use with any consistency are Gmail and Google Reader .
I also use SmugMug to catalog and share media with family and clients and Mozy to back up data .
For my Windows Mobile phone I use the service DashWire to conduct remote backups of contacts and other data .
Self Assessment
My computer usage reflects strongly on my general personality .
I do n't use many social networking tools , I 'm not the kind of person that Twitters the minute details of their life .
I share my personal pictures on a password - protected site only for family , not on Flickr .
When I 'm working I use a pretty Spartan set of tools which helps me stay focused .
Google Reader to distill my feeds , Firefox to help fling me about the web , a simple calendar , contact list , and to - do list in Outlook to sync with my Windows Mobile phone .
And when I 'm goofing around instead of getting work done I 'm all over the map experimenting with new software , dubbing foreign films , playing in Photoshop , building a TiVo clone out of spare parts from my workshop bins , trying out new tweaks on my XBMC , etc .
I love experimenting and playing with computers , I 've just come to a point in my life where I have enough of a time crunch that I have to be careful to fence off the " Let 's see what we can solder to this ! " part of my love for computers from my " Let 's get some work done and pay the bills ! " part .

Rush slammed after blaming Elizabeth Edwards for affair David Edwards and Nick Juliano
Published : Thursday August 14 , 2008
Print This Email This
Add this to the litany of shocking and offensive things to have emerged from right - wing radio host Rush Limbaugh 's mouth : " It just seems to me that [ John ]
Edwards might be attracted to a woman whose mouth did something other than talk . "
The popular conservative seemed quite clearly to be blaming Edwards 's wife , Elizabeth , who is battling breast cancer , with driving her husband to another woman .
Earlier in his nationally syndicated show Tuesday , Limbaugh launched into an extended diatribe on how Elizabeth was " smarter than John Edwards " and implied she was dictating his actions .
" In other words , could it be that she does n't shut up ? " he asked before promising , " Now that 's as far as I 'm going to go . "
It was n't .
And Limbaugh 's later effort to blame Elizabeth earned him substantial scorn Wednesday from liberal commentators and Media Matters .
" What better prepubescent dream of genital - waving dominance over all the women in the world , than to blame the intelligence of a woman for her husband 's infidelity , " MSNBC 's Keith Olbermann said on Countdown .
" What a pure sentiment to share with the less well recompensed losers who comprise your audience than to dismiss their failures as husbands -- as men , Rush -- on the woman .
" I mean even these days three divorces is a lot , " Olbermann continued , referring to Limbaugh 's own failed adventures with love .
" A $ 38 million salary and the guy can't keep the same woman .
Gotta be the woman 's fault right ? "
Olbermann went on to remind Limbaugh that his attacks on Bill Clinton 's infidelity coincided with a rise in the former president 's approval ratings , that plenty of Republicans have faced their share of bedroom - based blunders , that GOP nominee John McCain admitted his own infidelity after his first wife was in a car accident , and that before blowing the lid off the Edwards scandal the National Enquirer exposed Limbaugh 's own pill addiction .
Limbaugh 's defenders were tough to come by after his latest foot - in - mouth disaster .
Former Bush adviser turned Republican talking head Brad Blakeman said the tirade was " indefensible , " comparing Limbaugh to shock - jock Howard Stern .
" You cannot condone that kind of behavior , " Blakeman told Verdict host Dan Abrams .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Using written symbols such as hearts , arrows and hands , the ancient Aztecs maintained an arithmetic system that was far more complex than previously understood , scientists said on Thursday .
A general view shows the " Plaza de las Tres Culturas " , or the plaza of the three cultures , in the central Tlatelolco area of Mexico City December 27 , 2007 .
Using written symbols such as hearts , arrows and hands , the ancient Aztecs maintained an arithmetic system that was far more complex than previously understood , scientists said on Thursday .
REUTERS / Henry Romero
The Aztecs , an empire in central Mexico toppled by Spanish invaders in 1519 , has long been recognized for its sophistication in architecture , engineering , astronomy and other fields .
And the new research confirms arithmetic can be added to the list .
The researchers examined hundreds of drawings in two manuscripts dating back to between 1540 and 1544 that were used to document agricultural properties by the Aztec people in the city - state of Tepetlaoztoc , near modern Mexico City .
The Aztecs used a system that included symbols of hearts , hands , arrows , bones , arms as alternatives to using fractions .
An examination of these hieroglyphic records showed that the Aztecs used their own calculation system to figure out , for example , the area of a parcel of land .
“ What we thought we knew about the Aztec measuring system was a little simplistic .
We ’ve determined that it was more complex , ” researcher Barbara Williams of the University of Wisconsin - Rock County said in a telephone interview .
‘ NUMERATE SOCIETY ’
Williams teamed with Maria del Carmen Jorge y Jorge of the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico in the study published in the journal Science .
“ They used the four mathematical operations of addition , subtraction , multiplication and division .
But in almost all of the early societies , they could do everything they needed to do , with just those four .
They did n’t need square roots .
They did n’t need trigonometry , ” Williams said .
The two manuscripts -- one found in a library in France and the other in Mexico -- were written on European paper by Aztecs a couple of decades after the conquest , using the Aztec system .
They were land records drawn up that helped determine taxation imposed on the local people by the Spaniards , Williams said .
The fact that the Aztecs mathematically calculated areas has been known since 1980 , but until now there was little understanding as to how they did it , Williams said .
The Aztec empire held sway over a large part of Mesoamerica for about a century until the arrival of the Spanish , and their capital Tenochtitlan -- with towering pyramids and sumptuous architecture -- was larger than any European city of the era .
They were a war - like people that many people now associate more with human sacrifice -- which they certainly performed -- than their many accomplishments .
The new research adds further detail to the achievements of the Aztecs in other areas .
“ This increases our understanding of Aztec culture .
It gets to the idea that it was a numerate society in the rural areas as well as the urban areas -- among the surveyors as well as the priests and the royalty , ” Williams said .
As oil prices again flirt with records , and the U.S. Energy Information Administration hustles to revise upward its forecasts for the price of oil and gas , the “ peak oil ” camp seems to win more converts every day .
Even veteran oilmen like T. Boone Pickens say the era of “ easy oil ” is over .
Just do n’t tell the Kurds .
As Neil King reports today in the WSJ , the Kurdish region of northern Iraq is the last bastion of “ easy oil , ” where black pools seep to the surface and where wildcatters can strike gushers after a few months of ...

While Congress further drags its feet on extending the Investment Tax Credits ( ITCs ) for renewable energy ( likely until a new administration takes control ) , the states continue to provide their own incentives for alternative energy adoption .
Connecticut and Florida have already boosted incentives .
Now Wisconsin , South Carolina , and New York are joining the party ( Renewable Energy World ) .
Wisconsin :
Wisconsin Governor Jim Doyle 's Task Force on Global Warming has called for implementation of Advanced Renewable Tariffs to encourage the development of the state 's renewable energy resources ....
The call for Advanced Renewable Tariffs , or renewable energy payments , is but one of many measures recommended ....
The action is another sign of growing acceptance of the policy mechanism that has fueled the rapid growth of Germany and Spain 's renewable energy industry .
South Carolina :
... last month a decision by the South Carolina Public Service Commission ( PSC SC ) came to fruition as net metering for solar energy began in the state .
The ruling came after the commission began hearings on subject in 2005 .
This new PSC SC ruling applies to all investor - owned utilities including Duke Energy , Progress Energy and South Carolina Electric and Gas , it also makes South Carolina the 43rd state to have a net - metering policy .
In general , under net metering , a system owner receives retail credit for at least a portion of the electricity they generate .
New York :
... last week , New York Governor David Paterson signed a legislative package on August 5 that could encourage people throughout the state to install grid - connected solar and wind power systems , systems that generate power from farm wastes and " green " roofs .
Most of the bills relate to net metering .
Senate Bill 7171 expands net metering to include non-residential solar power systems up to 2 megawatts ( MW ) in capacity , or equal in size to the customer 's peak load , whichever is less , and increases the maximum solar power system size for residential customers to 25 kilowatts ( kW ) , up from 10 kW ....
...S. 8145 creates a four - year real property tax abatement of up to US $ 62,500 per year for buildings owners that install solar power systems , with a greater tax abatement available for systems installed before 2011 , and a lesser tax abatement for systems installed in 2011 or 2012 .
Importantly , state initiatives wo n't carry the day .
If the US is to become a major solar market , Congress will have to renew the ITCs .
The huge solar plants announced last week in CA , for example , are the result of a combination of state and federal subsidies .
In agreeing to buy power from the plants , PG&E is responding to a California law requiring that utilities buy 20 % of their power from renewable sources by 2010 .
The construction of the plants , meanwhile , is contingent on the renewal of the ITCs .

Oh look , the RNC has unveiled their welcoming committee :
MnIndy RNC reporter Jeff Severns Guntzel is at the Minneapolis Food Not Bombs house , which was raided by police this morning .
Facts are still coming in , but Guntzel says that at 8 a.m. neighbors near the home , located at 2301 23rd Avenue South , reported hearing a loud bang followed by yelling .
A single police squad car was parked out front .
When Guntzel arrived he saw eight or nine officers enter the house in what he says is a joint operation between officers of the Ramsey County Sheriff 's Department , the Minneapolis Police Depatment , and the FBI .
According to one witness who was in the house at the time of the raid , the action is related to last night 's raid on the RNC Welcoming Committee 's " convergence space . "
Several other spaces have been raided this morning .
Glenn Greenwald and Jane Hamsher are in Minneapolis for the RNC and went to two of the raided houses .
Glenn :
Each of the raided houses is known by neighbors as a " hippie house , " where 5 - 10 college - aged individuals live in a communal setting , and everyone we spoke with said that there had never been any problems of any kind in those houses , that they were filled with " peaceful kids " who are politically active but entirely unthreatening and friendly . [..]
There is clearly an intent on the part of law enforcement authorities here to engage in extreme and highly intimidating raids against those who are planning to protest the Convention .
The DNC in Denver was the site of several quite ugly incidents where law enforcement acted on behalf of Democratic Party officials and the corporate elite that funded the Convention to keep the media and protesters from doing anything remotely off - script .
But the massive and plainly excessive preemptive police raids in Minnesota are of a different order altogether .
Targeting people with machine - gun- carrying SWAT teams and mass raids in their homes , who are suspected of nothing more than planning dissident political protests at a political convention and who have engaged in no illegal activity whatsoever , is about as redolent of the worst tactics of a police state as can be imagined .
Jane took a video :
Glenn Greenwald and I arrived at one of the houses shortly after it was raided this morning .
It was a hippie house full of people in their late teens and early twenties who said they were here to " watch history . "
They were forced on the floor by roughly twenty cops carrying assault rifles , who initially refused to show them search warrants and joked about the " Terminator " and the " Executioner . "
We spoke with the people who were staying at the house about the raid in the video above , and they were really sweet and inspirational , interested in " food not bombs . "
Coming off the Denver DNC where most young people were blackberry - wielding Young Democrats hustling tickets to bigger and better parties , they were extremely refreshing and a much needed part of our political landscape .
The idea that they were a serious threat to security is rendered rather ludicrous by watching the video above .

The 2004 BMW 5 Series is one of the vehicles being recalled for a possible air bag defect .
WASHINGTON  BMW said Wednesday it was recalling 200,000 vehicles over concerns that the front passenger air bag may not deploy in a crash .
The German automaker said the recall involves the 2006 3 Series , the 2004 - 2006 5 Series , and the 2004 - 2006 X3 compact SUV in the United States .
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said in a posting on its website that small cracks could develop in a seat detection mat and deactivate the front passenger air bags .
NHTSA said the air bag warning lamp and the passenger air bag " on-off " light would remain on .
The head protection system , however , would not be affected , the government said .
BMW spokesman Tom Plucinsky said there were no injuries or accidents reported .
If the seat detection mat fails to sense that a person is sitting in the passenger seat , it deactivates the air bag .
Plucinsky said customers alerted the company when they noticed that the air bag light indicated a deactivated air bag even when a passenger sat in the seat .
NHTSA opened an investigation into the issue in September 2007 and upgraded its probe in January .
In addition to the vehicles under Wednesday 's recall , the ongoing investigation also includes the 2004 - 2006 Z4 , 2006 X5 , 2006 6 Series and some 2004 - 2006 7 Series vehicles .
BMW had received 23,739 warranty claims over the air bag system issue by early January , NHTSA said .
Plucinsky could not immediately address why the additional vehicles under NHTSA 's investigation were not part of the recall .
To respond to the problem , BMW said it would extend the warranty to 10 years without any mileage limit for the following vehicles : 2006 6 Series , 2006 3 Series with standard seat , 2004 - 2005 Z4 , 2004 - 2006 7 Series , 2006 X5 , and 2004 - 2006 5 Series with comfort seats .
BMW said under the extended warranty program , the detection mat in a vehicle with the air bag system problems would be replaced at no charge to the customer .

And showing a full understanding of that old maxim ' Use what you 've got ' , Heramb goes on to say , " I never had a problem with it and after I get publicity I will be famous because of it . "
The complaint refers to the repeat of the show in July last year
Motoring show Top Gear has been criticised by the BBC Trust after viewers complained about " highly irresponsible " footage .
The Polar Special featured hosts Jeremy Clarkson and James May drinking while driving as they tried to reach the Magnetic North Pole last year .
The trust said the scene " could be seen to glamorise the misuse of alcohol " .
The show 's executive producer said they were beyond the jurisdiction of drink driving laws in international waters .
' Editorial purpose '
The trust was also told that neither presenter was shown " drunk or out of control of the vehicle " .
The BBC Trust said the scene " was not editorially justified in the context of a family show pre-watershed " .
However , it added that at present in the UK , " it is legal to drink a small amount of alcohol and still drive " .
In the same show complaints were also made about scenes showing frostbitten genitalia .
The trust said there was " a clear editorial purpose for the inclusion of an image of a frostbitten penis , which had been shown for " a medical rather than a sexual purpose " .
You may already know the important of having a persuasive headline or title for your blog article etc. . . . however I am guessing you have never given too much thought to how critical including a P.S. ( Post Script ) is to your sales or written messages .
Your P.S. is the second most read element of your written copy , after your headline , subject line or the title of your blog article .
You should include your Post Script ’s immediately after your signature or at the end of your blog article .
You can have more than one PS .
as long as it ’s not boring .
4 Places You Need to Include a PS .
1. Letters
2. on your website
3. Emails
4. Blog Articles
When you are using a PS .
in a selling situation , a common mis-conception about P.S.s is . . . you should re-state your offer .
No , no , no !
If you do this , you will be giving the skimmers the opportunity of NOT reading any of the emotional parts of your copy .
Your prospect will simply not buy on price , or value , alone .
So you need to get some emotion into your P.S.s and direct your prospect back in to your sales copy .
Here Are Four Simple Rules to Writing Your Post Scripts
1. Restate you Headline in the first P.S .
2. Introduce another benefit , one which you never mentioned in the copy .
3 . Never reveal the price of your product in any of your P.S.s
4 . Your last words should be so call now on… .
Or on a website . . . so claim your xxx now . . . click the link below etc .
These are not hard and fast rules and at times you may need to bend them .
P.S. Examples :
P.S. FREE GIFTS !
Be one of the first 27 people to order either the Silver or Gold Membership in the next 7 days and I will also include Dan Kennedy ’s ‘ The Ultimate Success Secret ’ book valued at $ 22 .
Yours FREE !
If your order number is 28 , I ’m sorry you just wo n’t qualify for YOUR Free Gifts .
P.P.S. I have decided to make the GOLD Pack even more irresistible … if you order by the date stamped in RED ( see fast response form back page ) and you are one of the first 27 people to order it , I will include – a Gift Certificate for “ FREE 14 Nights Accommodation for 2 ”- Valued at over $ 1,000

P.P.P.S. Over $ 40 Million in Sales of the ‘ Magnetic Marketing ’ System alone & a 96 % success rate … all sold with a DOUBLE Guarantee … Start whipping Your COMPETITORS today !
Call now on …
There are no hard and fast rules on the number of P.S. ’s you should include , you would need to test this for your own particular niche .
However , three has proven to work well in the past and by making the middle one the strongest has proved to work well .
Now have a go at writing your own P.S.s and NEVER send any communications without at least one PS !
“ Dedicated to Kicking Your Ass Until You Succeed ! ”
Warmly
Toe Cracker

After years of working for free , Down 's syndrome man must PAY to wash councillors ' dishes
A Down 's syndrome man and Special Olympics champion who has been working for free for years is now being charged a fee to wash councillors ' dishes .
Virgil Taylor has been helping to wash up , wipe tables and set up trolleys in a restaurant used by town hall staff for 17 years as part of subsidised adult care services .
Every week Mr Taylor - who won a gold medal at the Special Olympics in Glasgow in 2005 - has attended 10 sessions run by the William Knowles Centre in Weston - super - Mare , Somerset .
But now savage cuts have ended the subsidies and the 34 - year - old will have to pay £ 2.50 per session for the ' privilege ' of cleaning up after councillors .
Shocked : Virgil and his mother Joan with the council letter announcing the new fees .
Below : Mr Taylor with his Special Olympics medal
His outraged mother Joan , of Winscombe , said : ' Virgil does not get paid for his time at the Town Hall .
But I would never stop him going as it makes him feel useful and he is so proud when he puts his uniform on .
' He does this for nothing but he loves it and that is the most important thing .
' How and why should he pay ?
The £ 2.50 per session will really eat into his savings . '
The family heard about the new fees in a letter from the council three weeks ago , she said , adding : ' Other parents and I have been given less than a month 's notice . '
Mr Taylor will even be charged for non-attendance , his mother said .
' I could n't believe it .
It just left me shocked and confused . '
The mother - of - six has now written to Weston MP John Penrose to protest .
Mrs Taylor said : ' I save the Government a lot of money keeping him with me and I would not have it any other way .
' I am an honest person and the underhanded way we have been treated sickens me .
' Those at the council should hang their heads in shame . '
Cllr Ian Peddlesden , North Somerset Council 's executive member for community services , adult services and housing , said : ' I believe most people receive other allowances that would cover these charges .
' The introduction of the fees was the result of the review we carried out after we won the elections last May .
' They pay for transport and also lunch if care service users spend whole days at sessions .
' This is the first complaint I have received about this . '
A council spokesman added : ' A non-attendance charge will only be applied for repeated failure to attend .
It will not apply for planned absences . '
The title here should strike a familiar theme for most readers .
Climate forcings do not just include CO 2 ( other greenhouse gases , aerosols , land use , the sun , the orbit and volcanoes all contribute ) , and the impact of human emissions often has non-climatic effects on biology and ecosystems .
First up last week was a call from Michael Prather and colleagues that the production of a previously neglected greenhouse gas ( NF 3 ) was increasing and could become a significant radiative forcing .
This paper was basically an update of calculations done for the IPCC combined with new information about the production of this non-Kyoto gas .
Most of the media stories that picked this up focused on the use of this gas in a particular manufacturing process – flat screen TVs .
Thus the headlines almost all read something like “ Flat - screen TVs cause global warming ” !
( see here , here , here etc. ) .
Unfortunately , very few of the headline writers read the small print .
NF 3 is indeed a more powerful greenhouse gas than CO 2 ( as are methane , CFCs and SF 6 etc. ) , but because it is much less prevalent , the net radiative forcing ( as with other Kyoto gases ) is much smaller .
Unfortunately , no - one has any measures of the concentration of NF 3 in the atmosphere .
This is likely to be increasing , since production has stepped up rapidly in recent years , but the amount of gas that escapes to the air is unknown .
Manufacturers claim that it is only a very small percentage – but historically such claims have not always been very reliable .
However , it is almost certain that NF 3 has not caused a significant amount of global warming ( yet ) .
The one issue that many stories did get wrong was in the comparison with coal .
Prather ’s paper compared the effect of the entire global production of NF 3 being released into the atmosphere with the CO 2 impact of one coal - fired power station .
Since that is the maximum estimate of the current effect , and only matches a single power - station , the subtlety of the comparison got a little lost on the way to “ Flat screen TVs ‘ worse than coal ’ ” story … .
Needless to say , no - one should be throwing away their flat screen TVs because of this ( it ’s not in the use of the TV that causes a problem ) , but manufacturers will likely need to step up monitoring of NF 3 leakage or switch to an alternative process which some have already done .
The second story getting some attention , is the ocean acidification issue .
As we ’ve discussed previously , the increased take up in the oceans of human - released CO 2 is rapidly increasing the acidity ( lowering the pH ) of the oceans , making it more difficult for many carbonate - producing organisms to produce calcite or aragonite .
These organisms include corals , coccolithophores , foraminfera , shell fish etc .
Both of these issues are relevant to the ongoing climate change discussion and it ’s good to see the media picking up ( albeit imperfectly ) on these ancillary discussions .
But as with the “ North Pole ” lightning rod discussed last week , there always needs to be a hook before something gets wide press ( the ‘ tyranny of the news peg ’ as ably described by Andy Revkin ) .
In the first case , there was a link to a popular consumer item and in the second , there has been a concerted effort to get the ocean acidification issue higher up the agenda .
The fact of the matter is that most of what goes on in the sciences is completely ( and usually correctly ) well below the radar of the public at large .
But when there are discoveries and issues that do have public policy ramifications , getting the public to pay attention often requires finding just these kinds of resonances .
Now if there was only a way to make sure the story underneath was accurate … .

“ Five years ago , I had a lock on things , ” says Mike Jimenez , the president of the California Correctional Peace Officers Association .
With his sunglasses , slicked - back hair , and trimmed beard , the 47 - year - old looks more like an aging rock guitarist than the head of the nation ’s largest prison guards ’ union .
“ Then I got questions with my own life , ” he continues .
“ I have a 19 - year - old son .
He was having interventions with law enforcement .
Drug related .
And I watched how the criminal system treated him .
It ’s assembly - line justice .
I was totally taken aback by it . ”
He ’s since started to question the efficacy of locking thousands of low - level offenders up “ in an institution where they become worse ” — the very institution he and his fellow union members helped build .
Jimenez ’s change of heart has been reflected in the fates of the organization he heads .
Five years ago , the ccpoa also had a lock on things .
A top donor to Govs. Pete Wilson and Gray Davis , it was one of the most powerful labor organizations in California .
In the 1990s , its tough - on - crime stances were routinely converted into legislation that ensured full prisons and new jobs , and made the guards the nation ’s best - paid corrections officers .
Candidates who crossed the ccpoa often saw their political careers derailed by attack ads sponsored by the union .
Today , however , the ccpoa is at a crossroads .
From the start of his term , Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger has treated the guards as a special interest group standing in the way of reform and has blamed them for many of the woes facing the state ’s bloated prisons .
And in a radical departure from years past , when the guards routinely received generous pay boosts even in lean years , at press time , the union and the state were fighting over a wage increase .
As the ccpoa ‘s relationship with its former allies has deteriorated , it has adopted some positions it once would have derided as dangerously liberal .
Last year , it released a policy paper that called for rolling back some mandatory minimum sentencing , restoring judges ’ discretion over sentencing , and giving correctional officials more input in setting parole dates .
It also advocated spending more on sick and mentally ill inmates , as well as reentry facilities for parolees .
Most surprisingly , the ccpoa has come out against Schwarzenegger ’s multibillion - dollar prison expansion plan , arguing it will lead to even more dangerous working conditions for its members .
Jimenez told a state prison commission that he fears outnumbered guards will be overwhelmed by overcrowded prisoners .
“ We are sitting on the edge of what nasa calls catastrophic failure , ” he concluded .
ccpoa has even filed an amicus brief in favor of an attempt by the Prison Law Office , a prisoners ’ legal rights group , to cap the state ’s prison population .
Critics say the union ’s new ideas are window dressing , a byproduct of its three - year showdown with Schwarzenegger .
That may be partly true .
But something extraordinary is happening inside the union , particularly behind the scenes .
In 2002 , the thuggish head of the ccpoa , Don Novey , was replaced by Mike Jimenez , who ’d worked his way up the ranks since he ’d become a guard in the 1980s after doing low - paying work in the oil fields .
Jimenez , a Republican , came to the job with a more reformist agenda .
And he has since been further radicalized by the events unfolding within his own family .
Jimenez speaks frankly about how his teenage son , Joshua , got into drugs , went to a boot camp in Utah ( “ it cost me every penny I made for six months ” ) , was charged with a string of low - end felonies , dropped out of high school , and told his father he had nothing to look forward to in life .
1 in every 9 African American men between 20 and 34 is behind bars .
“ I spent a lot of money , got him attorneys , went to great lengths to make sure he met the terms of his probation , ” recalls Jimenez .
“ But it occurred to me there ’re a lot of Joshuas who do n’t even know their dads .
They get involved with the criminal justice system .
It ’s a terrible reality .
I realized there are a lot of kids in there who should n’t be . ”
The realization completely changed the way Jimenez saw his job .
“ We plan to fail , ” he says of current correctional policies .
“ You can put all the police officers you want on the street , but if we do n’t give those kids hope of a future , of a life , of an ability to make something of themselves , they do n’t care about life .
Nobody ’s willing to forgive anymore .
And we are willing to lock people up for unreasonable periods of time . ”
Jimenez ’s revelation has trickled down the ccpoa hierarchy .
Even Lance Corcoran , a longtime union leader known as a hardliner , now comes off like a bleeding heart .
“ I ’m not saying I ’m sympathetic to people who go to prison , ” he says , a little cautiously .
“ But I ’m empathetic .
I do n’t want them to suffer unnecessarily . ”
Corcoran says the union has been talking with prison - reform organizations , and the two sides have found some common ground that would have seemed impossible a few years ago .
As he explains , “ Safer places for their loved ones to live in mean safer places for our members to work . ”

GOP chair : ' Beijing George ' threw us under the bus Nick Juliano
Published : Wednesday August 6 , 2008
Print This Email This
For the last few days , House Republicans have strode into an empty chamber to assail Democratic Speaker Nancy Pelosi for her refusal to grant oil companies expanded privileges to drill off America 's coasts .
While Pelosi remains Enemy No. 1 in the GOP demonstration , their party 's president is coming in for a growing share of criticism .
A top Republican excoriated President Bush for jetting off to China for the Olympics while ignoring what some conservatives say is his obligation to order Congress back to Washington to vote on offshore drilling legislation .
Republican House Policy Committee Chairman Thaddeus McCotter ( R - MI ) told fellow GOP lawmakers and staff that " Beijing George " was tossing his party 's lawmakers " under the bone dry bus , " The Hill reports .
Beginning last Friday , immediately after the House adjourned for a five - week recess , conservative Republicans stormed the Capitol 's empty House floor for a series of speeches on the need to open US coastlines to more drilling .
The protest has continued every day this week , and Republicans say they will maintain the demonstration until Pelosi agrees to a vote on their energy proposals .
( Some Republicans even are crediting their protest with causing a slight reduction in the price of gas this week . )
Democrats have derided the demonstration as little more than a publicity stunt and blame Congressional Republicans for blocking a variety of energy proposals that they say could lower prices without expanding drilling .
Environmentalists say oil companies are not sufficiently drilling on the leases they already have on tens of millions of offshore acres .
Bush is Constitutionally authorized to call Congress into special session -- which he threatened to do around this time last year to force a vote on a controversial spying law -- but the White House says the president will not exercise that power to advance the drilling debate .
Republicans initially were reserved in their targeting of Bush , and McCotter 's legislative update memo is the most severe broadside the lawmakers have aimed toward the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue .
McCotter , known for his frank and sometimes unusual political opinions , was not pleased with that decision .
His memo stated , " Today , in his final term , the wildly unpopular President George W. Bush boarded Air Force
One bound for the Beijing Olympics and a meeting with his chum Hu Jintao , the dapper ruler of a nuclear armed , communist dictatorship .
... Perhaps our Compassionate Conservative - in - Chief will bring our absent Democrat Congress some ' Made in ( communist ) China ' souvenir t- shirts : ' Bush went to Beijing and all I got was this lousy five week , paid vacation . ' "
A White House spokesman told The Hill that Bush supports the GOP 's demonstration but said a special session would be a waste of time if Pelosi refuses to allow a vote .
Just taking a step to any village outskirts and digging a few feet deep inside the soil would reveal tons of the things laying there since World War II .
Almost all the territory of Western Russia was a battlefield so if you ever go to Russia you do n’t need to pay a visit to an antique store , you can start digging at any place and get your part of loot .

Google must hand over YouTube data to Viacom after court ruling
Google is to be forced to release the records of every video watched on YouTube , including user names and web addresses , to entertainment company Viacom after a US federal court ruling .
Viacom , which is pursuing a $ 1bn ( £ 500 m ) copyright infringement lawsuit against Google , wants the information to determine the amount of copyright material on YouTube .
The disclosure could increase Google 's liability if Viacom wins the court case .
Google had argued that turning over the YouTube data would invade users ' privacy .
However , US district judge Louis Stanton ordered the internet company to hand over video records and information including login names and internet protocol addresses .
Viacom failed , however , in a bid to also secure access to the search engine giant 's source code , on the grounds that doing so would threaten Google 's business .
" You Tube should not be made to place this vital asset in hazard merely to allay speculation , " said Stanton .
Viacom filed the $ 1bn lawsuit against Google in March last year on the grounds that YouTube has built a business on allowing users to upload masses of copyright material .
Google argues that the Digital Millennium Copyright Act , which protects companies from copyright infringement by users as long as illegal material is taken down once notified , protects it .

Over at the The New Republic , Michael Crowley writes :
More handwringing about Obama 's optics : I see that tickets for his acceptance speech at Denver 's Invesco Field stadium sold out instantly .
In light of the apparent traction Republicans got with their ' Celebrity ' meme you have to wonder if the Obama team is reconsidering the wisdom of this move .
I would recommend any possible stagecraft to minimize the event 's scale .
No .
No. No. Crowley 's instinctive response here demonstrates much of what 's been wrong with the Democratic approach to politics over the last decade or so .
Obama 's ability to draw large enthusiastic crowds is one of his chief political strengths .
It is ludicrous not to showcase that strength just because your opponent has -- in classic Rovian style -- tried to turn it into a liability .
That 's how you lose elections .
The way to deal with the " celebrity " charge is not to lower your profile ; it's to turn that charge back around on McCain .
If I were advising Obama , I 'd tell him to get up there in front of that sold out stadium and say the following :
My opponent has taken to calling me a " celebrity " in all of his commercials .
The suggestion , I can only assume , is that all of you ( gesturing to the crowd ) show up at events like this and donate your time and your money to this campaign because you 're all adoring groupies who are obsessed with me .
Now , that would certainly be flattering if it were true , but I 'm not going to delude myself .
The reality is I can't act , I can't sing , and my personal life is incredibly boring .
The truth is that no one would be paying any attention to me at all if I was n't talking about things that really matter to a lot of people .
You 're not here tonight -- and you 're not watching at home -- because you want to be entertained .
Lord knows there are plenty of things that you could be doing with your time right now that would be far more entertaining than listening to me .
No , you 're here tonight because you love your country and you 're concerned about the direction it 's been heading over the last eight years .
You 're not here tonight to see what kind of outfit I 'm wearing or to hear my latest hit single -- and if you are , I think you 're probably going to be disappointed .
No , you 're here because you want change , you want a government that fights for people like you and not on behalf of powerful special interests ; you want a government that keeps you safe by pursuing a rationale foreign policy abroad and keeps your family secure by creating jobs , ensuring access to affordable health care , and fighting for energy independence .
That 's why you 're here .
That 's why you 're volunteering your time at record levels .
That 's why you 're contributing your hard - earned money in record amounts .
So remember , when John McCain and his surrogates call me a " celebrity , " they 're not insulting me ; they 're insulting you .
They 're insinuating that you are a mindless groupie rather than a concerned citizen , a fan rather than a voter .
But it 's not going to work .
You know why you 're here , you know why you 're watching , and you 're much smarter than they give you credit for .
BAGHDAD , Iraq ( CNN ) --
Four female suicide bombers and a gunman killed at least 70 people and wounded almost 300 others during a string of attacks in central Baghdad and Kirkuk on Monday , officials said .
An Iraqi man examines a tuft of human hair at the site of a suicide bombing in northern Baghdad on Monday .
In Baghdad , three suicide bombers detonated their explosives in three locations within 30 minutes of each other .
The attacks killed at least 32 people and wounded 102 others , most of them Shiite pilgrims , an Interior Ministry official said .
It was the second day attackers have targeted Shiite pilgrims taking part in an annual march to one of the Shiites ' holiest shrines .
On Sunday afternoon , seven pilgrims were gunned down in a town south of Baghdad .
Watch the pilgrims on the move »
About 150 miles north of the capital , another suicide bomber ran into a crowd of protesters at a Kurdish political rally , a police official said .
After she detonated the explosives she was carrying , gunmen began firing into the crowd from different directions , the official said .
The attack killed at least 38 people and wounded 178 others , the official said .
A bomb was discovered in a parked car near the site of the attack .
It was destroyed in a controlled explosion by Iraqi security forces , an Interior Ministry official said .
Thousands of Kurds had gathered in central Kirkuk to protest an election law that the Iraqi parliament passed last week , despite opposition from the Iraqi presidency council .
The Kurds consider the region encompassing Kirkuk -- a city of Kurds , Arabs and Turkmen -- majority Kurdish .
The Kurds , who have had intense political disputes with Arabs and Turkmen , oppose any power - sharing arrangement that would not reflect what they believe is their majority .
They also want a referendum asking Kirkuk residents whether they want to be part of the Kurdish Regional Government .

Following Monday 's attack , Kirkuk authorities imposed a curfew on the city from 3 p.m. Monday until 7 a.m.
Tuesday , a police official said .
All cars and pedestrian traffic will be banned , he said .
The Iraqi Islamic Party , one of the main Sunni parties , condemned the Kirkuk attack , blaming it on " sides that do not want stability in the city and are working to escalate the situation . "
It said the attack comes at a " critical and sensitive time where there has been an increase in talks about the fate of Kirkuk and provincial council elections . "
The use of female bombers is an increasingly common method for staging suicide attacks in Iraq because male security forces will not search women and few women have been trained to conduct searches .
Nearly two dozen suicide attacks have been carried out by female bombers in 2008 -- up from eight in 2007 -- according to U.S. military figures .
Before the bombings , security officials said they had deployed more than 200 women to conduct searches in Kadhimiya , in northwestern Baghdad , because of the rise in female suicide bombers .
The Sunday attack on Shiite pilgrims happened in the predominantly Sunni area of Salman Pak , also referred to as al - Madaen .
The Shiite pilgrims were walking to a shrine in Kadhimiya that commemorates the 8th century death of Imam Moussa al - Kadhim .
The pilgrims -- all males -- were carrying black flags and chanting religious songs before the attack .
They were attacked in a region that al Qaeda in Iraq controlled before Iraqi security forces gained control .
Al Qaeda in Iraq cells reportedly remain in villages around the town .
In recent days , hundreds of thousands of Shiite pilgrims have begun walking to Kadhimiya for the annual commemoration of al - Kadhim 's death .
Many have traveled from across the country , especially from Iraq 's southern Shiite provinces .
Iraqi security forces have established checkpoints and are conducting foot patrols to protect pilgrims .
People entering Kadhimiya are not allowed to carry weapons , bags , cell phones , radios or any type of communication devices , authorities said .
Pilgrims have been warned against accepting food and drinks from strangers .
They 've also been told to discount rumors of suicide bombers .
Such a rumor triggered a stampede that killed about 1,000 people during the pilgrimage in 2005 .
CNN 's Mohammed Tawfeeq contributed to this report .

The pound 's weakness is expected to hit UK holidaymakers this summer
The pound has touched a fresh all - time low against the euro , hit by market expectations that the Bank of England will further cut UK interest rates .
With the Bank widely tipped to trim rates to 5 % from 5.25 % on Thursday , one pound was worth as little as 1.2500 euros in early Wednesday trading .
Sterling later strengthened slightly , with one pound worth 1.2552 euros .
Interest rate cuts generally encourage investors to switch to other currencies that have a higher rate of return .
While the pound went as low as 1.2500 euros , conversely the European single currency touched as high as 80 pence .
Commentators say British holidaymakers are likely to notice the pound 's weakness when they go on their 2008 summer holidays to eurozone nations such as Spain , France and Portugal .
The Bank of England is widely expected to cut rates on Thursday to ease growing economic and consumer jitters caused by the impact of the global credit squeeze .
Against the dollar , the euro was up slightly to $ 1.5710 , while one pound was worth $ 1.9718 .

上のリンク先のページにある画像は錯視の一種。普段ＰＣを使っている距離から見ると，ただ縞模様の菱形が並んでいるだけの画像に見える。ところが，ディスプレイから顔を離して遠くから眺めてみると……不思議なことに，別の模様が見えてくる。
僕はちょっと目が悪いから，ディスプレイから 1 m ぐらい離れると，もう完全に「別の模様」しか見えない。視力のいい人や，眼鏡・コンタクトを着用している人だと，もう少し離れないとダメかもしれない。
しかしなぜ，距離によって見え方が変わってくるんだろう？ ブログ Illusion Sciences の Arthur Shapiro によれば，これは，人間の眼が近くにあるものしか細部を見ることができないためであるとされている。
件の画像の横縞は，比較的はっきりした模様として描かれているのに対して，縦縞の方は，非常にぼやけた感じで描かれている。こんなふうに「横縞ははっきりで，縦縞はぼんやりだな」と感じられるのは，画像を近くから見ているときだけで，十分に離れたところから眺めると，横縞も縦縞も同じぐらいぼやけたものに見えてしまう。それで，両者の境界が消えて，ひとつの繋がった模様のように見えてきてしまうというわけ。
原理としてはとても簡単なものだけれど，人間の視覚の前提にある法則（「ぼやけたものは，近寄ればはっきりと見えてくるはず」）を，巧妙に破っているところが面白い。「菱形」と「四角」が切り替わるギリギリの距離で頑張ってみると，奇妙な感覚に陥ってくる。気を張って凝視すれば菱形が見えるんだけど，ちょっと気を抜いたり瞬きをした瞬間に，それが四角に戻ってしまったりするんだよね。

WASHINGTON  The U.S. trade deficit unexpectedly fell in June as exports advanced to an all - time high , offsetting another big surge in oil imports .
The Commerce Department reported Tuesday the trade imbalance dropped to $ 56.8 billion in June , down by 4.1 % from a revised May deficit of $ 59.2 billion .
It 's the smallest deficit in three months and much better than the $ 61.5 billion deficit Wall Street had been expecting .
Exports of goods and services rose to a record of $ 164.4 billion , helped by the dollar 's declines earlier in the year , which have made U.S. goods cheaper on overseas markets .
Imports also rose to a record of $ 221.2 billion , up 1.8 % from the May level .
But the increase was driven by a 14.6 % surge in petroleum imports , which hit an all - time high of $ 44.5 billion as crude oil prices jumped to record levels .
The country 's goods trade deficit outside of petroleum shrank to the lowest level since February 2003 .
Demand for a variety of consumer products from clothing to televisions and furniture has weakened , reflecting the sharp economic slowdown in the United States .
Through the first half of this year , the trade deficit is running at an annual rate of $ 702.8 billion , up only slightly from last year 's deficit of $ 700.3 billion .
The 2007 deficit was down 7 % from 2006 , marking the first annual improvement after five straight years of record deficits .
The Bush administration points to the falling deficits as evidence that the president 's trade policies are working to open overseas markets to U.S. products .
But critics say the deficits still remain far above the levels in effect when Bush took office .
They also contend that the string of record deficits contributed to the loss of more than 3 million manufacturing jobs since 2001 as many companies moved production to low - wage countries .
The deficit in June , after adjusting for inflation , was the lowest monthly imbalance since December 2001 , a month when the country was struggling to emerge from a recession .
Many economists believe the 2008 slowdown will ultimately be ruled a recession , too , although the gross domestic product has yet to post back - to - back negative quarters , a traditional definition of a downturn .
The GDP expanded at an annual rate of 1.9 % in the April - June quarter but it would have been negative during that period had it not been for a sizable improvement in the trade balance , reflecting the drop in demand for imports and surging export sales .
Economists are worried that the big lift from exports could fade in coming months if economic growth in Europe and Japan , two big overseas markets for American goods , falters .
The politically sensitive deficit with China rose to $ 21.4 billion in June , the largest monthly imbalance since a record $ 25.9 billion deficit with China last October .
The deficit is likely to rise further in coming months .
The Chinese reported Monday that their surplus with the world rose to the highest level in eight months in July .
Its surpluses with the United States and the 27 - nation European Union expanded .
Critics accuse China of unfair trade practices such as artificially depressing the value of its currency to boost the competitiveness of Chinese products .
The Bush administration , led by Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson , has been prodding China to move more quickly to allow its currency to rise against the dollar and head off Democratic moves in Congress to impose penalty tariffs on Chinese goods over the currency issue .
The record level of U.S. exports in June reflected big increases in sales of farm products such as soybeans , corn and wheat and gains in exports of manufactured goods .
Sales of aircraft engines , electric generators and computer chips all posted big gains .
U.S. exports to Mexico , the European Union and South and Central America all hit records in June .
America 's deficit with OPEC set a record in June as the average price of imported crude oil climbed to a record of $ 117.13 per barrel .
Oil prices , which hit a record on the spot market of $ 147.27 in early July , have fallen by about 20 % since that time , raising hopes that the oil portion of the trade deficit will start to narrow in coming months .

THE TOWN OF ARGONIA in Sumner county , Kansas , became nationally and internationally known in 1887 when the voters of that little Quaker village , with a population of less than five hundred , elected the first woman mayor in America .
Mrs. Susanna Salter , who received this honor , was one of a number of women mayors elected during the years after the Civil War when women were renewing their demands for more political rights . [ 1 ]
Mrs. Salter was born Susanna Madora " Dora " Kinsey , near Lamira in Belmont county , Ohio , March 2 , 1860 .
Her parents , Oliver Kinsey and Terissa Ann White , were both of Quaker parentage , their ancestors having come to America from England with William Penn 's colonists on the ship Welcome .
The Kinsey family in successive generations moved form Pennsylvania to Ohio to Kansas , settling in 1872 on an 80 - acre farm in the Kaw valley near Silver Lake .
There Dora attended district schools until 1878 , when she entered Kansas State Agricultural College as a sophomore . [ 2 ]
She left college because of illness only six weeks before time to graduate .
While at Manhattan she had met Lewis Allison Salter , son of former Lt. Gov. Melville J. Salter .
Salter was graduated in 1879 , and Dora was married to him on September 1 , 1880 , at Silver Lake . [ 3 ]
The young couple moved to Argonia in 1882 , where Salter managed a hardware store .
The following spring Mrs. Salter gave birth to her second child , the first born in Argonia .
A year later Mrs. Salter 's parents moved to Argonia and bought the store , which was operated under the firm name of Kinsey & Salter .
In the meantime Salter read law with a local attorney and prepared himself for the bar .
The town of Argonia was incorporated in 1885 .
Mrs. Salter 's father , Oliver Kinsey , was its first mayor and her husband was city clerk .
In this capacity Salter wrote the ordinances of the town .
Two years later the Kansas legislature enacted a law giving the franchise to women in first , second , and third class cities .
Since Argonia was third class city , the women there became eligible to vote .
A Woman 's Christian Temperance Union had been organized in Argonia in 1883 , and with the right to vote , its members made enforcement of the state prohibition law a prime issue of the city election . [ 4 ]
They called a caucus and selected a ticket of men whom they considered to be worthy of the town 's offices , regardless of political labels .
In the absence of their president Mrs. Salter presided at this caucus .
A certain group of men in Argonia felt that the field of politics was their exclusive domain and resented the intrusion of women into their affairs .
Two of these men had attended the W.C.T.U. caucus and heckled the proceedings .
They were " wets , " trying to intimidate the W.C.T.U. , but when they attempted to nominate a candidate they were voted down .
A secret caucus was called by this faction .
Twenty of them met in the back room of a local restaurant and decided to teach these females a lesson .
They drew up a slate of candidates identical with that of the W.C.T.U. , except that for the office of mayor they substituted Mrs. Salter 's name .
They assumed that the women would vote for the W.C.T.U. slate and that the men would not vote for a woman .
They thought if Mrs. Salter got only their 20 votes it would embarrass the W.C.T.U. as a political organization .
They also felt that such a move would curb some of the W.C.T.U.'s political activities .
Mrs. Salter was chosen to be the butt of the prank because she was the only officer of the W.C.T.U. who was eligible for office , the others living outside the town limits .
This could be done as a surprise because candidates did not have to file before election day .
The faction simply had the ballots printed with Mrs. Salter 's name on them ; of course without her knowledge or consent .
Early voters on the morning of the election were shocked , therefore , to find that she was a candidate .
The chairman of the Republican party in Argonia immediately sent a delegation to see her .
They found her doing the family washing .
They explained the trick and then asked if she would accept the office if elected . [ 5 ]
When Mrs. Salter agreed , they said , " All right , we will elect you and just show those fellows who framed up this deal a thing or two . "
All day long they explained the situation and campaigned to get out the vote .
Mr. Salter , an early voter , was angered when he discovered his on the ballot .
He was even more perturbed when he returned home and found that his wife had consented to serve if elected .
Mrs. Salter was undeterred .
At 4 P.M. she went to the polls with her parents and voted .
It was not considered proper to vote for oneself in those days , so Mrs. Salter left the ballot for mayor unmarked .
By forsaking their own caucus nominee , the members of the W.C.T.U. voted for Mrs. Salter in such numbers that she received a two - thirds majority .
Instead of the 20 votes intended for her , the faction had given her the election .
Instead of humiliating the women , they had elected the first woman mayor in the country .
When the results were known , Mrs. Salter 's husband adjusted himself to the situation , and , with a certain amount of pride , made jokes about being the " husband of the mayor . "
ARGONIA 4/6/87 DORA SALTER , Argonia Madam
You are hereby notified that at an election held in the city of Argonia on Monday April 4/87 , for the purpose of electing city officers , you were duly elected to the office of Mayor of said city .
You will take due notice thereof and govern yourself accordingly .
WM .
H WATSON MAYOR F.A. RUSE Clerk Pro. tem .
Five members of the town council were also elected .
It was learned years later that three of them had been in the group of 20 pranksters .
Nevertheless , the new mayor had no trouble with these men during her year in office .
When she called the first council meeting to order , she said , " Gentlemen , what is your pleasure ?
You are the duly elected officials of this town , I am merely your presiding officer . "
This indicated to the surprised and skeptical councilmen that , contrary to predictions , they were not under " petticoat rule . "
She let the men take the lead in the council ; the council and mayor worked harmoniously throughout the year .
Actually the council did little .
Two draymen were arrested for refusing to buy licenses , some boys were warned about throwing rocks at a vacant house , but otherwise the term was politically uneventful .
No new ordinances were passed , although some of the ordinances which Mrs. Salter 's husband had drawn up were tested for their effectiveness .
Notwithstanding this uneventful term of office , Mrs. Salter immediately became one of the most talked about and written about political figures in America .
Newspapers sent correspondents to Argonia to visit her council meetings and to see how she conducted the town 's business .
Argonians were interviewed as to their reactions to a woman mayor .
Newspapers debated over the advisability of other towns electing women mayors .
Many objected to a possible " petticoat rule , " while others took a " wait and see " attitude .
Those who deferred judgment felt that if her term of office were a success women in politics might not be such a world - shaking change in American political life after all .
Other newspapers made the mayor the object of many editorial jokes and sly remarks . [ 6 ]
One of the first council meetings over which Mrs. Salter presided was attended by a correspondent of the New York Sun .
She knew that her every act would be publicized over the nation .
She was determined to handle the council meeting with a firm hand , showing the world that a woman could hold her own in the realm of politics .
The correspondent was impressed .
When he wrote his story , he described the mayor 's dress and hat , and pointed out that she presided with great decorum .
He noted that several times she checked discussion which she deemed irrelevant , showing that she was a good parliamentarian .
The councilmen , though respectful , bore the air of protesting pupils of a not over - popular school mistress .
No official action was taken on any subject at this particular meeting , though an order of business was carried out and several matters discussed .
A photographic reproduction of the official notice of election
sent to Mrs. Lewis Allison Slater in April , 1887
His position on Georgia makes much more sense if you see it in this context .
In his own narrative , he is always the one man who kept the faith while so many lost theirs .
Only McCain had the courage to champion Petraeus ; only McCain was in intimate contact with Saakashvili before most others had even heard of him ; only McCain can rescue Iraq ; only McCain will defeat Iran and Russia and China , because only McCain has the moral clarity to see them as the evil they are , and only McCain has the balls to defend the weak and the defenseless ( unless , of course , the CIA has them in a locked , dark cell ) .
That the world and America might need other virtues in the current global context does not occur to him .
That these often admirably intentioned crusades might require more prudential reasoning , restrained caution and delicate diplomacy is not in his play - book .
What Americans have to decide is whether , after the last seven years , this kind of with - us - or - against - us crusade against enemies near and far is the right approach to the current crisis .
or whether it is part of the reason we are already in so deep .

At ground zero of a national housing crisis
In Nevada , 77 percent of all homeowners — not just those in foreclosure — will feel the effects of declining property values
Sun Topics Sun Topics : Real Estate in Crisis
Buddy
Yates sits at a dining room table awash in paperwork .
The bills , late notices and letters represent his nearly yearlong quest to keep his family in the three - bedroom North Las Vegas tract home he bought two years ago .
In December , when he could no longer afford the $ 2,365 - a- month payments , much less the higher payments set to kick in within months , he dialed up his Texas - based lender , EMC .
Yates , a 60 - year - old pastor who officiates at valley wedding chapels , wanted the company to restructure his loan by lowering his payments and spreading them over a longer term .
By Yates ’ account , he ran into a thicket of red tape .
After seemingly endless waits on hold , he told his story over and over because the same staffer was n’t available .
Company representatives would then give contradictory advice , he said .
“ When you talk to some of those people it ’s like talking to this table , ” Yates said .
Despite lenders ’ promises to step up efforts to work with homeowners facing foreclosure , about half wo n’t reach a deal with their bank , according to recent figures .
As of the second quarter of this year , 12,000 Nevada homes went into foreclosure .
Lenders were in negotiations with just more than half that number , according to Hope Now , a nationwide mortgage industry group that offers foreclosure counseling .
But the number of borrowers in need of assistance is expected to grow .
Nevada is expected to remain at the epicenter of the nation ’s foreclosure crisis — the Pew Center on the States projects one in 11 homes in the state will enter foreclosure by 2010 — and Yates ’ Sunrise Acres housing development seems to lie on a fault line .
Within one block of his home , more than a half - dozen residences are bank - owned or in some stage of the foreclosure process , according to Realty Trac , a Web site that maintains a nationwide database of foreclosed homes .
Like his neighbors , Yates was hit by a slumping economy and falling real estate values .
Last year , his income started to shrink as more couples skipped the trip to Las Vegas for their wedding and tied the knot at home .
As it was getting harder for Yates to pay his $ 300,000 mortgage , the value of his home was dropping , and as a result he could n’t refinance his loan .
Three weeks ago , Yates met his new neighbors , who had just purchased the house next door out of foreclosure for $ 167,000 .
He figures his house is n’t worth much more .
But it ’s still home for him , his wife and their 4 - year - old son .
Lenders have been deluged by borrowers seeking help .
“ They just do n’t have enough beating hearts to answer the phones , ” said Kathleen Day at the Washington , D.C. - based Center for Responsible Lending .
Wells Fargo spokeswoman Natalie Brown said her company ’s staff has grown fivefold to deal with delinquent loans than the bank had five years ago .
Debbie Krznarich of EMC , which holds Yates ’ mortgage , would not discuss staffing levels at the company .
Even borrowers who reach their lender face obstacles .
Most loans have been sold to investors , who must approve deals with individual homeowners , Day said .
Trustees who manage these loans are sometimes reluctant to modify them for fear of being sued by the investors .
What ’s more , for borrowers who have second mortgages , both the first and second lien holders must agree to a deal before it can be offered to a homeowner .
Counselors who help troubled borrowers negotiate with their lenders are also swamped .
Michelle Johnson , chief executive of Consumer Credit Counseling , reports that traffic at her agency is up 60 percent to 70 percent from last year .
Recent federal government initiatives to clean up the foreclosure mess have not helped Nevadans , Johnson said .
An FHA program offers refinancing to homeowners with 3 percent equity in their homes , but few distressed homeowners in the state have any equity .
“ The last I heard , there had not been a single ( FHA refinance ) loan made to anyone in Nevada , ” she said .
The impact from the foreclosures extends beyond those who lose their homes .
The Pew Center predicts that in Nevada 77 percent of all homeowners , not just those in foreclosure , will feel the effects in the form of falling property values .
That will have an impact on state and local tax revenue .
“ It ’s a concern for health , safety and economic viability , ” said Lon DeWeese , chief financial officer of the Nevada Housing Division .
In June , Yates met face to face with an EMC representative .
EMC ’s Krznarich said that Yates was offered a fair deal that would allow him to keep his home .
But Yates , who has missed more than one payment , said the repayment plan would put him only further behind .
By the time he paid the arrears , he said , the interest rate on his adjustable - rate mortgage would go up , putting him back in the same predicament .
Yates has asked the Neighborhood Assistance Corporation of America , a nonprofit housing counseling group , for assistance .
If he does n’t get a reprieve , he said , he ’s expecting a letter this month saying the company will foreclose on his home .
“ When they sold you the home , they knew ( with the adjustable interest rate ) , you were n’t going to be able to make the payment , ” Yates said .
“ They do n’t have compassion for the family who ’s in the home . ”
This morning we suggested that some ballsy investor might do well by looking at newspapers now , when no one else wants to touch them .
Vishal Iyer , an AOL designer , provided this eloquent counterargument , via a photo he posted on his blog today .

However , you should always be on the lookout for such a site to ensure that you have a first class and completely hassle free type of gaming experience when paying your chosen casino games online .
There are several things that you should always be on the lookout when you are comparing casino sites .
The very first thing that you should be paying attention to is to whether the casino is actually licensed and regulated !
By ensuring that any casino site that you sign up to and then play at as a real money player is fully licensed and regulated then you are never going to run into any type of problems at those sites , for the games will have been fully verified independently as being fair and random and each casino will be adhering to an industry wide range of high standards .

You will find that all of our featured UK online casino sites are some of the very best casinos around as they will also be offering you plenty of bonus offers , not only when you first sign up to those casino sites but also on an ongoing basis too .
Earning Comps and Getting Access to High Paying Casino Games
Another aspect of choosing just which casino sites you should be playing at will be just how many rewards and extras you are going to be getting at the sites you do sign up to and play at as a reel a money player .
One way that you are always going to be rewarded for every single wager you do decide to place on any real money games at all of our featured and top rated best online casino sites is by you earning comp points as you play .
Our approved casino sites will not only award you with a large number of those comp points as you play but they will also be giving you some very low redemption rates too , meaning you will always have the option and ability to swap and cash in your points for lots of playing credits at a time of your own choosing .
The way in which you are going to find just which real money casino games are going to be giving you the very best chance of winning will simply involve you playing the games on which the highest payout percentages can be found or those casino card and table games that have the very lowest house edges .
If you take a look over our listed range of the best online casinos you will often find all of the house edges and the long term expected payout percentages have been listed on the websites of those casino sites , so accessing that information will never be too difficult , and the savviest of real money casino game players will only ever play the games listed with the lowest house edges and those games that have the very highest possible payout percentages too , so keep that in mind !
Players Advice for Picking the Best Online Casinos
We put out a call on our website recently asking for other players to give some hints and tips to new online players in regards to helping them pick out the best online casinos at which to play at along with any additional advise those experienced players could give to new players , and as such their comments and advice are listed below .
Make sure you are earning comp points !
I would like to pass on a good tip to players and that is you can often find differences in regards to the amount of comp points you can and will be earning and also the redemption rates when playing for real money at different casino sites .
So do some shopping around for the value of the comps you can and will earn at some casino sites will be much more generous than the ones on offer at many other different casinos - Jack
More than one Casino account
One mistake I made a number of years was to open up an extra casino account at one casino site , I did have a winning session on that newly opened account but when the casino manager realised I already had another account they closed my account and only refunded my deposit .
My advice would be for you to always make a note when you do sign up to any online casino sites and make a list of just which casinos you have joined , for you will get banned from any casino if you open up more than one account with any of them - Paul
Look out for tailor bonus offers
I have found that the best online casino sites will always give me a range tailored bonus offers usually at least once a week , however those bonus offers are often sent to me by email and I often think they are just spam and never read them !
With that in mind if you are a regular player at any online casino sites make sure you always read the emails the casino site sends you out as often there will be some unique and exclusive bonus offers available to you which are listed and mentioned in those emails , and if you do not see the emails you will never know those bonuses are waiting to be claimed and you could end up missing out on all of them too .

LONDON ( Reuters ) -
An Israeli tank crew who killed a Reuters cameraman and eight young bystanders in the Gaza Strip four months ago acted properly and will not face legal action , Israel ’s senior military lawyer has concluded .
The military advocate - general told the international news agency in a letter sent on Tuesday that troops could not see whether Fadel Shana was operating a camera or a weapon but were nonetheless justified in firing a shell packed with darts that killed him and eight other Palestinians aged between 12 and 20 .
Reuters said on Wednesday it was deeply disturbed by a conclusion that severely curtails the freedom of the media to cover the conflict by effectively giving soldiers a free hand to kill without being sure they were not firing on journalists .
Shana , 24 , filmed two tanks positioned about 1.5 km ( a mile ) from where he was standing for several minutes before , in a chilling final 2 seconds of video , his camera captured one tank firing a shell that burst overhead , showering the journalist and others with thousands of metal darts known as flechettes .
“ The tank crew was unable to determine the nature of the object mounted on the tripod and positively identify it as an anti-tank missile , a mortar or a television camera , ” Brigadier General Avihai Mendelblit of the Israel Defence Forces wrote .
But the military lawyer cited an attack that killed three IDF soldiers in another part of the enclave earlier in the day , a separate grenade attack on a tank , the fact that Shana and his soundman who was wounded were wearing body armor -- “ common to Palestinian terrorists ” -- among reasons for suspicion .
Their blue flak jackets , like the car , were marked “ PRESS ” .
The army said the troops could not see those signs .
Journalists in Gaza say they have rarely seen militants wear flak jackets .
Reuters cameraman Fadel Shana is seen in this undated handout picture .
An Israeli tank crew who killed Shana and eight young bystanders in the Gaza Strip four months ago acted properly and will not face legal action , Israel 's senior military lawyer has concluded .
Reuters said on Wednesday it was deeply disturbed by a conclusion that severely curtails the freedom of the media to cover the conflict by effectively giving soldiers a free hand to kill without being sure they were not firing on journalists .
REUTERS / Handout / Files
Mendelblit wrote : “ In light of the reasonable conclusion reached by the tank crew and its superiors that the characters were hostile and were carrying an object most likely to be a weapon , the decision to fire at the targets ... was sound ...
“ There is no doubt that Fadel Shana ’s death is a tragedy ...
“ A journalist in action was killed by IDF fire , along with others not involved in the hostilities .
“ However ... the available evidence does not suggest misconduct or criminal misbehavior ...
I have therefore decided ... that no further legal measures will be taken . ”
Reuters Editor - in - Chief David Schlesinger said : “ I ’m extremely disappointed that this report condones a disproportionate use of deadly force in a situation the army itself admitted had not been analyzed clearly .
“ They would appear to take the view that any raising of a camera into position could garner a deadly response . ”
Reuters wrote to Mendelblit on Wednesday with a number of questions , including asking precisely why the soldiers ruled out the possibility that Shana was a cameraman , why the fact he stood in full view of the tanks for some minutes did not suggest he had no hostile intent and why the tank crew , if concerned but unsure , did not simply reverse a few meters out of sight .
The Foreign Press Association in Israel said the army had a “ long line of cases clearing its soldiers of deadly negligence ” .
It added : “ The army is obligated to clearly identify its targets before firing , especially in areas where civilians and journalists are present .
The mere suspicion of possible hostilities should not be enough to justify overwhelming deadly force .
“ We hope that the army ’s conclusion does not appear to give soldiers free license to fire without being sure of the target , greatly hindering the media ’s ability to cover the conflict . ”
In New York , Joel Campagna of the Committee to Protect Journalists said : “ These findings mean that a journalist with a camera is at risk of coming under fire and there ’s not that much that can be done .
That ’s unacceptable .
“ It ’s difficult to believe ... that the IDF took the necessary precautions to avoid causing harm to civilians -- as it is obliged to do under international law . ”
" Perl 5 to 6 " Lesson 13 - Custom Operators
2015-02-26
multi sub postfix :<!>( Int $ x ) { my $ factorial = 1 ; $ factorial *= $ _ for 2 ..$x ; return $ factorial ; } say 5 ! ; # 120
Operators are functions with unusual names , and a few additional properties like precedence and associativity .
Perl 6 usually follows the pattern term infix term , where term can be optionally preceded by prefix operators and followed by postfix or postcircumfix operators .
1 + 1 infix +1 prefix $ x++ postfix < a b c> circumfix @ a [ 1 ] postcircumfix
Operator names are not limited to " special " characters , they can contain anything except whitespace .
The long name of an operator is its type , followed by a colon and a string literal or list of the symbol or symbols , for example infix : <+> is the the operator in 1+2 .
Another example is postcircumfix : <[ ]> , which is the operator in @ a [ 0 ] .
With this knowledge you can already define new operators :
multi sub prefix :<€> ( Str $ x ) { 2 * $ x ; } say € 4 ; # 8
In an expression like $ a + $ b * $ c the infix : <*> operator has tighter precedence than infix : <+> , which is why the expression is evaluated as $ a + ( $ b * $ c ) .
The precedence of a new operator can be specified in comparison to to existing operators :
multi sub infix : < foo > is equiv ( &infix : <+ >) { ... } mutli sub infix : < bar > is tighter ( &infix : <+ >) { ... } mutli sub infix : < baz > is looser ( &infix : <+ > ) { ... }
Most infix operators take only two arguments .
In an expression like 1 / 2 / 4 the associativity of the operator decides the order of evaluation .
The infix :</> operator is left associative , so this expression is parsed as ( 1 / 2 ) / 4 . for a right associative operator like infix : <**> ( exponentiation ) 2 ** 2 ** 4 is parsed as 2 ** ( 2 ** 4 ) .
Perl 6 has more associativities : none forbids chaining of operators of the same precedence ( for example 2 < = > 3 <=> 4 is forbidden ) , and infix : < , > has list associativity .
1 , 2 , 3 is translated to infix : <, >( 1 ; 2 ; 3 ) .
Finally there 's the chain associativity : $ a < $b < $ c translates to ( $a < $ b ) && ( $b < $ c ) .
multi sub infix : < foo > is tighter ( &infix : <+ > ) is assoc ( ' left ' ) ( $a , $ b ) { ... }
Most ( if not all ) existing operators are multi subs , and can therefore be customized for new types .
Adding a multi sub is the way of " overloading " operators .
class MyStr { ... } multi sub infix :<~>( MyStr $ this , Str $ other ) { ... }
This means that you can write objects that behave just like the built in " special " objects like Str , Int etc .
Allowing the user to declare new operators and " overload " existing ones makes user defined types just as powerful and useful as built in types .
If the built in ones turn out to be insufficient , you can replace them with new ones that better fit your situation , without changing anything in the compiler .
It also removes the gap between using a language and modifying the language .

What astounds me about the " race card " -- which either did or did n't get played in the presidential race recently -- is its thinness .
Racial politics , and racism itself , used to be a way of life , as pervasive as hatred , as far - reaching as ignorance .
Large institutions were devoted to it , politicians reveled in it , history is permeated with it .
And now all that 's left of the phenomenon , apparently -- or so it would seem , to anyone whose 24/7 mind - control machine ( once known as the boob tube ) is hooked up -- is that single card , the playing of which not only queers the game but forces a moment of freaked - out media attention on the fact that a game is being played at all , and all of us are in some vague way participants .
An examination of the incident might be illuminating not so we can cast a verdict on it one way or the other , necessarily , but so we can get a glimpse of the contours of the game itself , and the larger context in which it hovers uneasily .
That context , of course , is America , past , present and future .
Presidential elections have , over the years , it seems to me , become more and more about the game and less and less about the context .
So what happened , of course , is that last week Barack Obama said : " Nobody thinks that Bush and McCain have a real answer to the challenges we face .
So what they 're going to try to do is make you scared of me .
You know , ' he 's not patriotic enough , he 's got a funny name , ' you know , 'he does n't look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills . ' "
And a day earlier , in the wake of Obama 's high - five world tour that generated enormous media attention , John McCain 's campaign released an ad that noted sourly : " He 's the biggest celebrity in the world , but is he ready to lead ? "
Mixed with images of Obama in Europe were America 's two favorite airheads , Britney Spears and Paris Hilton .
Maybe their presence in the ad is completely innocent , but to angry critics , the operative inference is that they 're sexy , young white women " notorious for displaying themselves to the paparazzi while not wearing underwear , " as New York Times columnist Bob Herbert noted .
And this is the state of America 's racial awareness in the 21st century , as manifested in our quadrennial ritual of power transfer , the process that 's supposed to make us the world 's greatest democracy .
How embarrassing .
I blame the actual participants in the " game " -- the presidential race -- who are trapped in a win- lose struggle with enormous stakes , far less than I blame the pervasive corporate media , which are unable to resist the temptation to hop into the game with them .
Thus they breathlessly report on every last gaffe and emotionally manipulative sound bite , every poll spike , every superficial accusation , with gleeful overkill , keeping us overly informed about nothing in particular , and at the same time they do their best to reduce the context of their reportage to the game itself .
What matters is who wins , not what the country learns about itself and decides to become .
This dumbed - down state of national awareness , which the media seem to feel obligated to maintain , reminds me of a defining characteristic of very primitive societies :
They have a name for every bend in the river , but no name for the river .
The " river " of presidential politics is our evolving , collective consciousness .
What , then , might the race card incident tell us about the name and destiny of this river ?
Our nation has evolved through three distinct eras of racial awareness .
The first , of course , is the Slave Era , when we lived with the concept of human chattel and conceded African - Americans three - fifths the humanity , and none of the rights , of white people .
The Jim Crow Era followed the Civil War , Reconstruction and the constitutional corrections of Amendments 13 , 14 and 15 .
This era was characterized by racial prejudice hardly less virulent than during the Slave Era , lynching picnics and a wide array of laws maintaining racial separation and inequality in every aspect of life .
White supremacy was overt and unashamed of itself : James Jeffries was " the Great White Hope , " for instance , when he took on black boxing champ Jack Johnson in 1910 .
The Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s ended the Jim Crow Era , stigmatized racism and shattered most legal forms of racial discrimination , forcing the still - virulent racism harbored in many American hearts underground .
This is the era we are still in : the era of racial code words and indirect , de facto discrimination .
It 's the era of Bush I 's infamous Willie Horton ad and Nixon 's Southern strategy , by which the Republican Party quietly ceased to be the party of Lincoln .
It 's the Era of Forgetting .
And Obama , by poking at the nation 's subterranean racism , by suggesting that the McCain campaign was not above tapping into it through fear and innuendo , violated the cardinal rule of the Era of Forgetting :
He talked about it .
McCain , through Paris and Britney , sought only to remind us of how scared we used to be .
It was a nostalgic appeal to the good old days .
Do n't make more of it than that .

Last month , author Andrew Klavan wrote that the new Batman film is a “ paean of praise to the fortitude and moral courage that has been shown by George W. Bush in this time of terror and war . ”
CNN ’s Glenn Beck agreed today , listing off controversial Bush policies he claims were vindicated by the film ’s showcase of “ conservative values on the war on terror ” :
But Batman goes into another country and with a C - 130 snatches a guy out , and then throws him back here into Gotham .
So there ’s rendition .
At one point the Morgan Freeman character says to Batman , wait a minute , hang on , you ’re eavesdropping on everyone in Gotham ?
And Batman says , yes , to stop this terrorist .
Morgan Freeman says , I ca n’t be a part of it .
And yet Morgan Freeman does become a part of it , and they find the Joker .
One of the ways they find the Joker is through eavesdropping .
I mean the parallels here of what ’s going on is to me stunning .
Watch it :
Beck also said that Bush ’s willingness to “ die as the worst president ever because of the war on terror ” is “ exactly the message that Batman carries . ”

There 's not exactly a whole bunch of news going on right now .
According to the Mail we are witnessing the " Invasion of the killer jellyfish " ( except Portuguese men o' war have been reported on British shores since at least 2003 ) , the hunt for the Yeti continues , and there 's always room for another " equation for " story .
Somehow what does n't get into the papers is as interesting as what does .
Right now I 'm looking at a press release on a story which seems pretty important to me : people with serious mental illnesses are committing fewer murders than ever before , by a truly enormous margin .
Homicides in this group increased from around 40 a year in the 1950s to 100 a year in the 1970s , in line with a similar increase in the general population .
But while murders by people like you have continued to increase , and roughly trebled ( 0.6 per 100,000 of population in the 1950s , and almost two per 100,000 now ) , murders by people with serious mental illnesses , despite the hype and the fear , the public pronouncements and the headlines , have come down massively since the 1970s , to fewer than 20 a year today .
Alongside the silly season stories , this startling new analysis of several different databases worth of information was not considered newsworthy .
It got coverage in New Scientist ( ooh ) and BBC Online only .
Nobody else touched it .
What a mystery .
Journalists are traditionally fascinated by mental illness after all .
Celebrities with schizophrenia or depression can expect to have their hospital admissions ( and embarrassing behaviour when unwell ) diligently documented by the newspapers , and murders associated with mental illness receive blanket media coverage , with extensive campaigns both in the media and at grassroots level .
When the " mental health tsar " Louis Appleby called for more effort at reducing murders by people with serious mental health problems last year ( a " bloke has opinion " story if ever I saw one ) it was news to every single newspaper .
Journalists also love numbers - they use them for a spurious sense of precision , and for an air of scienciness - and this story had plenty , from a proper study , published in the British Journal of Psychiatry .
Journalists also routinely take stories handed to them on a plate by press releases , as a quick scan of any newspaper will rapidly reveal .
According to research commissioned by Guardian journalist Nick Davies from Cardiff University , about 80 % of news coverage is rehashed from them .
There is a crowd pleasing answer here , of course , which is that society is very simply prejudiced .
But there is also a more mundane explanation .
In a generous mood , you would n't say this was a very badly written press release , but it does n't give the story on a plate , at first glance , with a populist headline , a catchy narrative to hang it on , the offer of photos ( with breasts ) and the idea that " stigmas and deep - rooted fears are misguided " flagged up in neon lights .
You had to pay attention to find the news .
And it was n't widely disseminated .
My friend Nadia Stone writes positive stories about people with mental health problems ( it 's why we 're friends ) .
There was one simple reason she did n't run with it : she gets plenty of nonsense from PR companies on pills and cosmetics , but the academic journal did n't send their press release to local papers , which often cover the very anecdotes that can wrongly calibrate peoples fears and prejudices .
" It might actually have been useful considering two men with schizophrenia escaped from a mental hospital near Exeter on Tuesday night , and everyone 's been very scared . "
We are convinced by the media that people with serious mental illnesses make a significant contribution to murders , and we formulate our approach as a society to tens of thousands of people on the basis of the actions of about 20 .
Once again , the decisions we make , the attitudes we have , and the prejudices we express are all entirely rational , when analysed in terms of the flawed information we are fed , only half chewed , from the mouths of morons .
Interesting :
Soldiers were deployed throughout Italy on Monday to embassies , subway and railway stations , as part of broader government measures to fight violent crime here for which illegal immigrants are broadly blamed .
[…]
The conservative government of Silvio Berlusconi won elections in April while promising to crack down on petty crime and illegal immigrants .
The new patrols of soldiers , who are not empowered to make arrests , do not seem aimed only at illegal immigrants , though the patrols were deployed to centers where illegal immigrants are housed .
“ Security is something concrete , ” Mr. La Russa said on Monday .
The troops , he said , will be a “ deterrent to criminals . ”

Bright Chunks At Phoenix Lander 's Mars Site Must Have Been Ice
June 19 , 2008 -- Dice - size crumbs of bright material have vanished from inside a trench where they were photographed by NASA 's Phoenix Mars Lander four days ago , convincing scientists that the material was frozen water that vaporized after digging exposed it .
" It must be ice , " said Phoenix Principal Investigator Peter Smith of the University of Arizona , Tucson .
" These little clumps completely disappearing over the course of a few days , that is perfect evidence that it 's ice .
There had been some question whether the bright material was salt .
Salt ca n't do that . "
The chunks were left at the bottom of a trench informally called " Dodo - Goldilocks " when Phoenix 's Robotic Arm enlarged that trench on June 15 , during the 20th Martian day , or sol , since landing .
Several were gone when Phoenix looked at the trench early today , on Sol 24 .
Also early today , digging in a different trench , the Robotic Arm connected with a hard surface that has scientists excited about the prospect of next uncovering an icy layer .
The Phoenix science team spent Thursday analyzing new images and data successfully returned from the lander earlier in the day .
Studying the initial findings from the new " Snow White 2 " trench , located to the right of " Snow White 1 , " Ray Arvidson of Washington University in St. Louis , co-investigator for the robotic arm , said , " We have dug a trench and uncovered a hard layer at the same depth as the ice layer in our other trench . "
On Sol 24 , Phoenix extended the first trench in the middle of a polygon at the " Wonderland " site .
While digging , the Robotic Arm came upon a firm layer , and after three attempts to dig further , the arm went into a holding position .
Such an action is expected when the Robotic Arm comes upon a hard surface .
Meanwhile , the spacecraft team at Lockheed Martin Space Systems in Denver is preparing a software patch to send to Phoenix in a few days so scientific data can again be saved onboard overnight when needed .
Because of a large amount a duplicative file - maintenance data generated by the spacecraft Tuesday , the team is taking the precaution of not storing science data in Phoenix 's flash memory , and instead downlinking it at the end of every day , until the conditions that produced those duplicative data files are corrected .
" We now understand what happened , and we can fix it with a software patch , " said Phoenix Project Manager Barry Goldstein of NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory , Pasadena .
" Our three - month schedule has 30 days of margin for contingencies like this , and we have used only one contingency day out of 24 sols .
The mission is well ahead of schedule .
We are making excellent progress toward full mission success . "

MOSCOW , Aug 9 ( Reuters ) - Prime Minister Vladimir Putin accused Georgia on Saturday of seeking " bloody adventures " and trying to drag other countries into a military conflict in its separatist region of South Ossetia .
" Georgia 's aspiration to join NATO ... is driven by its attempt to drag other nations and peoples into its bloody adventures , " he said during a meeting in the Russian city of Vladikavkaz .

WESLACO , Texas --
In the archives of local institutions , Juan Aranda 's life is firmly rooted in this small south Texas town .
His birth certificate says he was delivered unto Weslaco 38 years ago , and church records say he was baptized here soon after .
School files list him as a student in the local district from kindergarten through high school , and voter rolls show he votes for president here .
But to the U.S. State Department , all that black and white looks a lot like gray .
It recently refused to issue Mr. Aranda a passport ; the government is n't sure he's an American .
" I never imagined my U.S. citizenship would be questioned , " says the manager at a water company .
" I 've lived here since the day I was born . "
The problem is that Mr. Aranda was delivered by a midwife at a private home .
Parteras , Spanish for midwives , have been part of life in Hidalgo and Cameron counties along the border with Mexico from the time of the Texas Republic and before .
But in the early 1990s , dozens of midwives were convicted of forging U.S. birth certificates for about 15,000 children born in Mexico as far back as the 1960s .
Welcome to the new and improved SWOP - USA website !
We ’re going through many changes as an organization and a digital overhaul is part of that .
You ’ll find an entirely new resource section , our Chapter Hub site has moved here , and we ’ll also be producing significantly more resource sheets in the coming months .
Sex Workers Outreach Project - USA is a national social justice network dedicated to the fundamental human rights of people involved in the sex trade and their communities , focusing on ending violence and stigma through education and advocacy .
As much as any other reporter , The New Yorker ’s Jane Mayer has helped expose the post - 9/11 system of detention , rendition and abuse of ‘ enemy combatants . ’
Her book out today , " The Dark Side , " significantly expands on her reporting .
We talked to Mayer about how the move to the system started with bureaucratic bungling and the curiously passive role of President Bush , who kept “ disappearing from the frame . ”
Editor ’s Note : Umansky ’s reporting is briefly cited in the book .
Before you even get to torture , you suggest that the move to a more aggressive war paradigm was ill - considered .
A lot of the mistakes before 9/11 were n’t about being insufficiently aggressive you suggest but were just the result of bureaucratic bungling .
One of the things that struck me in talking from interviewing lots of people involved in the war on terror is that we were n’t hit by al - Qaida on September 11 , 2001 because we had been unable to torture people before .
That was n’t the problem .
When you look closely at the record , it was n’t that the laws were inadequate .
In fact , the U.S. did amazingly well prosecuting terrorists as criminals .
And the FBI did pretty well in keeping on top of the expanding al - Qaida ’s operations .
What went wrong was both simple and complex : First , there was ordinary incompetence .
Most importantly , the CIA forgot to tell the FBI that two al - Qaida suspects had entered America more than a year before 9/11 .
They just dropped the ball .
And complicating things was a lack of political will .
At the White House , arguments went round and round about whether to use lethal force against al - Qaida .
Nobody really wanted to step up to it and so nobody really did .
One thing that has always struck me -- putting aside for a moment the treatment of enemy combatants -- was the near - total lack of process in deciding who was one .
That was huge .
Some of these things were just amateur mistakes .
And it sprang from when they threw out the Geneva Conventions , which includes a process for screening POWs , so you can figure out who ’s truly an enemy and who ’s just an innocent bystander .
When they got rid of the Geneva Conventions they threw out the screening process -- Article 5 hearings .
And when they stopped screening , inevitably , they made a lot of mistakes .
You pointed to the irony that the administration was focused on expanding presidential power when in fact a lot of these decisions were n’t emanating from there ...
It is an irony .
The big argument being made by the vice president , his lawyer , David Addington , and the Justice Department was that the commander - and - chief needed almost unfettered powers to win the war on terror .
And yet when you really examine the record , it ’s frequently not the president who ’s making many of these calls ; it ’s the vice president .
The president , it ’s funny , I asked a lot of questions about him when I was doing interviews , and he keeps disappearing from the frame of the picture .
He is described as distracted by one of the people who briefed him .
Colin Powell tells a friend who I interviewed he sees the president not as being stupid but as being too easily manipulated by Cheney , who knew how to push him around .
You write that after the Supreme Court ’s Hamdan decision in 2006 -- which said detainees were covered by portions of the Geneva Conventions -- the president initially appeared to be against proposing legislation to overturn the decision .
Yes , he actually makes the call against Cheney and Addington at that point -- after having been lobbied Condoleezza Rice and Karen Hughes .
In this case , when he did get all the facts , he decided against Cheney and Addington .
And that was pretty unusual from what I could see .
And yet , then the Military Commissions Act happened -- Congress did overturn the Court ’s decision .
Yes , then the MCA happens .
Also , when the president gives his speech about closing down the CIA ’s black sites , rather than it becoming a means of criticizing those policies [ as Mayer writes an initial draft reflected ] , the vice president finds a way to convince him to keep the black sites open at least in theory .
Talk a bit about the challenges of doing all this reporting when there have been so few prosecutions and such little congressional inquiry .
That ’s true , though there are beginning to finally be stirrings in Congress .
Carl Levin ’s office did an 18 - month investigation that released some really interesting documents recently .
Without a subpoena reporters are left to beg .
I ’ve done a lot of begging over the last few years .
Luckily there are a number of people inside the administration , certainly within the military and FBI who were upset enough about of some of these policies that they felt it was important to get word out .
I ’m not sure people realized how much of a fight it was inside the government .
I mean , we had [ former administration lawyer ]
Jack Goldsmith ’s book , and [ former Deputy Attorney General ]
James Comey ’s testimony about the NSA wiretapping -- which was one of the most amazing things I ’ve ever heard .
But what I tried to do was connect the dots .
And tell more about the struggle -- how it went from a fight over America ’s security to a fight over its soul .
You write about a CIA official going down to Gitmo in 2002 and concluding that many of the prisoners were innocent ; it ’s been one of the things pegged as news .
And yet reports of that have been bouncing around for a long time .
I wonder if that ’s because the detainee and torture story keeps coming out in bits and parts , and so we forget ...
You ’re wondering whether the same news keeps getting recycled .
You know , part of the challenge to me was to take a lot of the reporting that has been out there -- and there ’s been some fantastic reporting on this whole area .
The stories have broken out of order , so it ’s hard to make sense out of the whole narrative because you learn fragments of it here and fragments of it there .
What I was trying to tell in the book was the story from start to finish , as best as I could .
If you put it in order it somehow has more impact , because people begin to understand it better .
I also think the country was kind of in a numb state and resistant to thinking about this for a long time .
The zeitgeist has changed a bit and there ’s a bit more openness toward being critical .
So now I think people are thinking about it freshly again , even though some of the material has been out there before .
I ’ve been covering this for three years .
And I did n’t understand a lot until I put it all together .
I really truly did n’t understand , for example , the relationship between things happening in Washington and for instance , the interrogation of Manadel Al - Jamadi in Iraq .
That there was a fight in Washington over what standards could be used for his interrogation and whether the Geneva Conventions applied in Iraq .
When the CIA interrogated him to death , basically , it all took place within a vortex of legal confusion -- with the CIA crying in Iraq for legal guidance , asking for a lawyer .
Only when you put all the pieces together do you really begin to understand the story .
For instance , I had n’t realized that Special Forces had handled the early part of the interrogation , then he was handed over to the CIA , then he dies in their hands -- at Abu Ghraib .
And then that picture of him -- the famous “ iceman ” photo -- that is part of the packet of shots from Abu Ghraib that come out and startle the world .
There ’s this whole connection between all of these events that ’s really hard to see until you try to tell it as a story .
Lehman Brothers ( LEH ) has issued a formal apology in a note to clients for copying parts of a Sanford Berstein report on virtualization technology .
The report in question was written in March 2008 by Tim Luke and bore an uncanny resemblance in parts to two notes written earlier by Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi .
Mr. Luke is , um , no longer with Lehman .
WSJ :
Lehman said that some analysis and work toward the end of the report closely resembled two reports by Bernstein .
These include several pages of text and graphics .
The staffer responsible for lifting the data is no longer at Lehman , according to a person familiar with the matter .
" Once this matter came to our attention we thoroughly investigated the situation and took the appropriate corrective actions , " a Lehman spokeswoman said .
Neither Messrs .
Luke nor Sacconaghi responded to calls for comment .
" We greatly appreciate Lehman 's letter , which both informed clients and apologized to Bernstein , that Lehman had published research containing materials authored by Bernstein without Bernstein 's permission or attribution , " a Bernstein spokesman said .

The Air Force wants a suite of hacker tools , to give it " access " to — and " full control " of — any kind of computer there is .
And once the info warriors are in , the Air Force wants them to keep tabs on their " adversaries ’ information infrastructure completely undetected . "
The government is growing increasingly interested in waging war online .
The Air Force recently put together a " Cyberspace Command , " with a charter to rule networks the way its fighter jets rule the skies .
The Department of Homeland Security , Darpa , and other agencies are teaming up for a five - year , $ 30 billion " national cybersecurity initiative . "
That includes an electronic test range , where federally - funded hackers can test out the latest electronic attacks .
" You used to need an army to wage a war , " a recent Air Force commercial notes .
" Now , all you need is an Internet connection . "
On Monday , the Air Force Research Laboratory introduced a two - year , $ 11 million effort to put together hardware and software tools for " Dominant Cyber Offensive Engagement . "
" Of interest are any and all techniques to enable user and / or root level access , " a request for proposals notes , " to both fixed ( PC ) or mobile computing platforms … any and all operating systems , patch levels , applications and hardware . "
This is n’t just some computer science study , mind you ; " research efforts under this program are expected to result in complete functional capabilities . "
Unlike an Air Force colonel ’s proposal , to knock down enemy websites with military botnets , the Research Lab is encouraging a sneaky , " low and slow " approach .
The preferred attack consists of lying quiet , and then " stealthily exfiltrat[ing ] information " from adversaries ’ networks .
But , in the end , the Air Force wants to see all kinds of " techniques and technologies " to " Deceive , Deny , Disrupt , Degrade , [ or ] Destroy " hostile systems .
And " in addition to these main concepts , " the Research Lab would like to see studies into " Proactive Botnet Defense Technology Development , " the " reinvent[ion of ] the network protocol stack " and new antennas , based on carbon nanotubes .
Traditionally , the military has been extremely reluctant to talk much about offensive operations online .
Instead , the focus has normally been on protecting against electronic attacks .
But in the last year or so , the tone has changed — and become more bellicose .
" Cyber , as a warfighting domain . . . like air , favors the offense , " said Lani Kass , a special assistant to the Air Force Chief of Staff who previously headed up the service ’s Cyberspace Task Force .
" If you ’re defending in cyber , you ’re already too late . "
" We want to go in and knock them out in the first round , " added Lt. Gen. Robert Elder , commander of the 8th Air Force , which focuses on network issues .
" An adversary needs to know that the U.S. possesses powerful hard and soft - kill ( cyberwarfare ) means for attacking adversary information and command and support systems at all levels , " a recent Defense Department report notes .
" Every potential adversary , from nation states to rogue individuals … should be compelled to consider … an attack on U.S. systems resulting in highly undesireable consequences to their own security . "

In the waning months of his tenure , President Bush and his allies are once again trying to scare Congress into expanding the president ’s powers to spy on Americans without a court order .
This week , the White House and Democratic and Republican leaders on Capitol Hill hope to announce a “ compromise ” on a domestic spying bill .
If they do , it will be presented as an indispensable tool for protecting the nation ’s security that still safeguards our civil liberties .
The White House will paint opponents as weak - kneed liberals who do not understand and cannot stand up to the threat of terrorism .
The bill is not a compromise .
The final details are being worked out , but all indications are that many of its provisions are both unnecessary and a threat to the Bill of Rights .
The White House and the Congressional Republicans who support the bill have two real aims .
They want to undermine the power of the courts to review the legality of domestic spying programs .
And they want to give a legal shield to the telecommunications companies that broke the law by helping Mr. Bush carry out his warrantless wiretapping operation .
The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act , or FISA , requires the government to get a warrant to intercept communications between anyone in this country and anyone outside it .
The 1978 law created a special court that has approved all but a handful of the government ’s many thousands of warrant requests .

John McCain has cultivated the rep of a politician unafraid of questions .
When he campaigned for president in 2000 , he often hung out with reporters on his bus and fielded questions until the journalists were out of queries .
In the 2008 campaign , as he did eight years earlier , McCain has held town hall meetings during which he called on attendees who were obviously not McCain supporters .
( It was during one such exchange that McCain said it would be “ fine ” by him if U.S. troops remained in Iraq for “ a hundred years . ” )
So why then does it seem that the McCain campaign has been screening questioners during the conference calls featuring campaign aides and top - level surrogates it mounts for reporters ?
In the 2008 campaign , conference calls with reporters have become an essential part of candidates ’ media operations .
During the most heated days of the Barack Obama - Hillary Clinton contest , both campaigns arranged at least one conference call a day ( sometimes there were more ) .
“ Our calls were open to all press — national , local , and online , ” says Howard Wolfson , who was communications director for the Clinton campaign .
“ Although from time to time we tried to give priority to local press in whatever state we happened to have a primary , we never screened reporters or questions . ”
And Tommy Vietor , a spokesman for the Obama campaign , says , “ We do n’t screen our calls . ”
For these calls , reporters dialed a toll - free number and were quickly connected to the call in a listen - only mode .
After the campaign spinners and surrogates finished their opening remarks , the journalists fired questions at them .
( To ask a question , reporters merely had to punch * 1 on the keypad and get in line . )
Hillary Clinton ’s aides often remained on the line for an hour or longer to answer a great many questions covering assorted topics .
Obama ’s advisers were stingier with their time ; consequently , many reporters did not get a chance to ask anything .
But both campaigns took questions on a first - come basis , without the campaign aides knowing which reporter was on the other end when his or her line was opened .
For the aides , it was sort of like holding a press conference in a totally dark room .
When the operator said , “ next question , ” they had no clue who would be in the interrogator ’s seat .
This is not how the McCain campaign does it .
When a reporter calls in for a conference call , he or she is asked by an operator to provide his or her name and media outlet .
Then when it comes time for questions , there is a long pause–long enough for someone in the campaign to select whom should be called on .
This has caused several journalists who have participated in these calls to wonder : is the McCain campaign screening reporters , and , if so , on what basis ?
A reporter for a progressive media outlet says that he has tried at least half a dozen times to ask a question on a McCain conference call and has had never been selected .
The same has happened to me .
No matter how quickly I press * 1 , I ’m never afforded the opportunity to pose a question .
During a June 27 McCain campaign call with former Republican Massachusetts Governor Jane Swift ( who was deriding Obama for holding a unity rally with Hillary Clinton at Unity , New Hampshire ) , I raised my hand , electronically .
Two reporters were called on–one from AOL News , the other from the Tampa Tribune–and then the McCain aide hosting the call said , “ Seems we are out of questions , ” and ended the call .
My hand was still up .
The easy suspicion is that McCain aides are playing favorites and are not as enthusiastic about confronting tough questions as their boss .
During a July 1 McCain campaign call featuring Senator Lindsey Graham and Orson Swindle ( who was a Vietnam POW with McCain ) , only two questions were taken –both from conservative bloggers .
The first came from Ed Morrissey , who asked Graham and Swindle , “ Can you explain the significance of John McCain ’s command experience in the Navy …as well as whatever leadership he has shown in the Senate …. and can you address … that Barack Obama does n’t have any executive experience at all ? ”
The next query came from Matt Lewis .
Referencing retired General Wesley Clark ’s recent comment that McCain ’s military service and POW experience did not qualify him to be president , Lewis asked Graham and Swindle if Clark ’s remark was part of “ a concerted effort by the Obama campaign , or can liberals simply not keep themselves from attacking the military ? ”
Then the call was over .
Had it been merely a coincidence that the only questioners had been rightwing bloggers who had served up soft balls ?
Despite McCain ’s obvious fondness for talking with reporters , his campaign , curiously , seems to be limiting access to his aides and surrogates .
One campaign reporter says that after he published stores that were not to the liking of the McCain campaign , its press office threatened to cut him off .
And several weeks ago , during a conference call , an operator came on the line and told me that I “ was no longer needed ” on the call .
Though I explained I was a journalist listening to the call , the operator said he had been told to unplug me .
I protested the decision , and he said he would check and get right back .
The operator never returned , and I remained on the call .
But during the question period , I was not called on .
In an email , I asked Jill Hazelbaker , McCain ’s communications director , if the McCain campaign was screening reporters in an attempt to manage the conference calls .
She did not reply .
I called the campaign ’s media office and posed the same question .
The woman who answered placed me on hold .
A few moments later , she told me that a press officer would soon call with an answer .
No one ever did .

Xbox 360 Completely Sold Out in Japan
The Xbox hardware has traditionally experienced low sales in Japan , but sales were apparently sparked by the recent Japanese debut of Namco Bandai's Xbox 360 exclusive Tales of Vesperia .
The action - RPG is due out in North America next week .
Namco Bandai's Tales of Vesperia , an Xbox 360 exclusive .
" Currently , the Xbox 360 is sold out , and retailers are unable to restock their supply , " reads the official Microsoft statement , as translated by Kotaku .
" This is a result of our own sales targets being exceeded by the actual customer sales , " the company continued .
" We deeply apologize for this inconvenience to our customers , retailers and business partners ... We truly thank you for your patronage hereafter . "
A similar sales boost accompanied the Xbox 360 - exclusive release of Namco Bandai's Ace Combat 6 last year , though that spike did not lead to hardware shortages .
Everglades National Park has obtained approval to proceed with a plan to redesign the most developed area of the park with an emphasis on promoting sustainability .
Through building design , alternative energy , and improved transportation systems , the park area known as “ Flamingo ” will be reborn as an example for other parks to follow .
Flamingo is near the very bottom tip of Florida ’s mainland , and in 2005 , Hurricanes Katrina and Wilma landed a knock - out punch to what was until then a heavily visited area .
Damage from the hurricanes effectively destroyed a dilapidated but popular lodge , its restaurant , and numerous other facilities – leaving virtually no place for park visitors to stay overnight in the park if not camping .
The park was pressured by numerous groups to rebuild overnight visitor facilities as soon as possible .
After releasing several plans and receiving public comment , the park has selected a plan that blends sustainable ideas with creature comforts .
I myself used to work as a park ranger in Flamingo , and I think the plan is brilliant .
There ’s only one catch : the park has no idea where to get the estimated $ 20 - 23 million it needs to bring the plan to fruition .
My feeling though is that when you ’ve got a good plan and a strong desire for action , then you will find investors to help you make it happen .
These are some of the cooler elements to the plan :
All new buildings will be built on stilts , reducing potential hurricane damage .
A 30 - room lodge with a restaurant inside will be the center of activity .
12 duplex cottages and 40 intriguing and novel eco-tent structures will also be built .
Solar energy will be used to heat showers in the lodge , campground restrooms , and to provide energy for fans and lights .
Approximately 50 acres will be restored to their natural condition .
Most of this land will be made available by restoring infrequently used campground areas .
Rainwater will be collected in cisterns for non-potable uses .
RV sites in the campground will be outfitted with solar - powered hookups that will help reduce noise pollution from RV generators .
New pathways for walking will be constructed and a “ Yellow Bike ” program initiated that will allow for visitors to use free bikes to get to and from the area ’s trails and attractions .
A free shuttle will move people around the area and reduce private car use .
Recycled plastic lumber will be used to construct walkways rather than wood .
Why is Flamingo so popular ?
What do people do there ?
If you are wondering why Flamingo is so popular , it sits right on Florida Bay , making it a good spot to launch fishing and canoe / kayak trips .
The area also showcases the park ’s abundant wildlife and plants .
They include an incredible diversity of wading birds like herons , alligators , snakes , insects ( most notably the mosquito– which the area is also famous for ) , orchids , mangrove trees , and strangler fig trees .
The heat and mosquitoes can make living conditions intolerable at many times of the year in the Everglades , and for this reason Flamingo and Everglades National Park are at their best in the winter months .
If you would like to read more about the park ’s plan to rebuild Flamingo , you can read the official press release at the park ’s website .
Click here if you want to download a PDF of the detailed plan which provides interesting mock - up illustrations of the eco-tents and lodge .
The Miami Herald also recently printed an article that provides an excellent background on Flamingo and the park ’s new plan to rejuvenate the area .

MEXICO CITY , Mexico ( CNN ) -- Mexico's highest court voted 8 - 3 Thursday to uphold women 's right to abortion in the capital .
" This is a momentous decision and legal victory for women and families in Mexico , " said Lilian Sepúlveda , regional manager and legal adviser for Latin America and the Caribbean at the Center for Reproductive Rights .
" In a region where abortion is highly restricted , the Supreme Court has taken a huge leap forward in protecting women 's basic human rights .
Today 's ruling opens the door for women across the country to demand that their local governments follow Mexico City 's example . "
A representative of the Catholic church , which opposes abortion , said it would ring the bells of the city 's cathedral in mourning .
Mexico is overwhelmingly Roman Catholic .
Four of the 11 Supreme Court ministers would have been needed to invalidate last year 's changes that allowed first - trimester abortions in Mexico City .
Outside Mexico
City , abortion is legal only in cases of rape , if the mother 's life is in danger or if the fetus is badly deformed .
Do n't Miss Mexico court shows support for abortion law
In 2007 , Mexico City 's leftist government legalized abortions in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy .
The federal Attorney General 's Office and National Human Rights Commission took the law to the Supreme Court , arguing that the city can't make health laws .
Thursday 's vote by the justices formalized their rejection of the proposal put forth by Aguirre Sandino , one of the ministers , who argued that the law is unconstitutional because life begins at conception and should therefore be protected from that time forward .
But his fellow ministers did not agree .
" The ministers that voted against his proposal say there is no place explicitly in the Mexican constitution or in international law that says life should be protected from the moment of conception , " said Maria Luisa Sanchez Fuentes , executive director of the Information Group on Reproductive Choice , who was one of about 150 people inside the courtroom .
" There is always a flexibility and exceptions , " she said , citing the right to kill in self - defense or to carry out a hunger strike .
Those who defend the current law say it has helped save the lives of hundreds of young women who otherwise would have sought abortions at clandestine , unsafe clinics .
Many Mexicans have said they believe that the right to an abortion means a woman is more like to be promiscuous .
Brenda Velez , 38 , visits an abortion clinic four times a week to recite the rosary , according to The Association Press .
" They are just encouraging women to be dirty and loose , " she said .
" The justices ' decision is only going to spread more irresponsible behavior . "
Serrano Limon , an anti-abortion advocate , said legalized abortion " gave legality to these pseudo - doctors to open their clinics and continue operating as they are doing , and now , they 're no longer doing it in secret , they 're doing it openly . "
The law applies only to Mexico City 's public hospitals .
It also allows doctors with moral objections to refuse to do the procedure and does not require doctors in federal hospitals or private clinics to perform abortions , the AP reports .
Before abortion was legalized , many women turned to an herbal tea capable of inducing abortion , the AP said , and also sought out people who performed crude procedures to terminate a pregnancy .

Transcript :
Steve Wasserman :
Ray Bradbury .
Ray Bradbury : Yeah .
Wasserman :
Thank you for sitting down to talk with us this morning , on a day which sees — in Los Angeles at least , and probably throughout the rest of the country — a growing number of bookstores ending , shuttering , declining , a growing number of book review sections starting to close .
Barely a handful of American newspapers any longer bother to review books , much less have a separate section .
Bradbury :
That ’s right , yeah .
Wasserman : And I understand that the Los Angeles Times , after 33 years , will be ending their publication of a separate section devoted to the review of books .
I speak as someone who for nearly 10 years had edited that section .
I wanted to sit down with you because you ’ve been so outspoken and eloquent the whole of your life , and most recently at the sight of Acres of Books in Long Beach , the threatened closure of that remarkable secondhand store .
And I remember very well in 1997 , just as I was assuming the editorship of the Los Angeles Times Book Review , at that very moment you were given a lifetime achievement award by the L.A. Times , and you took the occasion very memorably to denounce the L.A .
Times for its meager coverage of books , and you admonished the Times to live up to its own ambitions .
And I admired your ability to both bite the hand that feeds as well as to speak truth to power , even though I have to confess it hurt a little bit .
So tell me — you grew up in Los Angeles very largely , or least you moved here when you were how old … ?
Bradbury : Thirteen years old .
Wasserman : Thirteen years old .
And at the time when you moved here , you were living in what is downtown Los Angeles .
Bradbury : Almost downtown , yeah .
Wasserman : Almost downtown .
And at that time , were there bookstores that flourished in Los Angeles , which for you became places of magical transport ?
Bradbury : Sixth Street was fantastic .
There were eight bookstores on Sixth Street … along , from Hill Street all the way up to Figueroa .
You could go in all kinds of bookstores .
And that ’s where I met my future wife .
I went and found her brother ’s bookstore and the young clerk waited on me , and she discovered I had written a story she read .
And I took her to dinner a couple of weeks later and I held her hand and engaged her and married her .
So that ’s the bookstores on Sixth Street for you .
Wasserman : Right .
And do you remember what it was about the physical contact with books which seemed to be so exciting for you ?
Bradbury : A lot of it is the smell of books .
There are — a lot of those bookstores were used bookstores .
Some were high - quality used books and new publications , but the other bookstores were … a lot of used books , and there ’s thousands of them in there , and they were covered with dust and the smell of ancient Egypt .
So , you go into a used bookstore and surprise yourself .
Surprise in life should be everything .
You should n’t know what you ’re doing .
You should go into a bookstore to be surprised and changed .
So the bookstores change you and reveal new sides of yourself .
That ’s the importance of a used bookstore .
Wasserman :
And is something being lost with the disappearance of these bookstores , even as the technology for conveying to people the contents of books seems to every day advance ?
Bradbury :
The bookstores are there for you to stumble over yourself .
You must — that ’s the trouble .
…
Universities do not teach you ; they do not discover you .
I raised myself in used bookstores .
I went in looking for myself and I found me on every shelf .
I opened strange books .
I saw a mirror image of myself in there and said , “ Oh , my God , that ’s me !
I ’ll take that .
I ’ll go home . ”
So used bookstores are surprise boxes to be opened constantly .
And they ’re not there now , so there ’s no chance of revealing people to themselves .
They do n’t get revealed with these new inventions , with the , the telephones that they use , with the Internet and what have you .
That ’s no surprise — it does n’t work .
Wasserman :
As you ’ve lived the literary culture of Los Angeles and have been one of its defining personalities — as you look back over these five or six or more decades in which you ’ve been , you know , part of the very fabric of Los Angeles literary culture , what ’s changed most dramatically for you , either for good or for bad ?
Bradbury : Well , we do n’t have the authors here that we used to have .
Sixty years ago , all the major science fiction authors lived in the L.A. area , and Robert Heinlein became my friend and my teacher , and he sold my first short story for me .
It went into Script Magazine .
And all the other writers became my friends .
Leigh Brackett was a leading science fiction writer .
I used to meet her every Sunday down in Muscle Beach , and she read my terrible stories and I read her good ones .
So over a period of five years of going to Muscle Beach and meeting my favorite writer , I became a writer .
But that environment is no longer here .
Those writers do n’t exist anymore .
Wasserman :
Well , some would argue , and perhaps convincingly , that those writers have been replaced by other writers who are writing about all kinds of things — whether it ’s science fiction or the politics of assimilation of the new waves of immigrants who ’ve come to Los Angeles — that there ’s new and fresher writing .
But what disturbs many of us , of course , is that in a region so geographically sprawling as Los Angeles , that there exists no particular publication any longer that provides a central clearinghouse by which writers might meet and recognize and critique each other ’s work .
Bradbury : Absolutely .
In fact , I helped a couple of bookstores along the way put together a literary meeting place .
There should be a fireplace in every bookstore with comfortable chairs and tables and drinks every afternoon [ so that ] you can come sit with the other writer friends and assimilate ways of becoming a writer .
Wasserman : Right .
And what are the obligations , if any , of those people who yearn to become readers ?
Are newspapers as they existed helpful for people who aspire actually to become a reader ?
I mean , I note that the Los Angeles Times did report last week that one out of every three high school students in Los Angeles drops out before the end of high school .
And so , it seems the very idea of being able to read itself seems to be challenged .
Bradbury :
We have to go — right now we have to rebuild our total education system in the entire United States over and beyond the book reports and the book publication and what have you .
We ’re trying to educate people when they ’re in the fifth , sixth and seventh grade — it ’s too late .
You cannot teach a 10 - year - old child to read and write .
It begins when they ’re 4 and 5 — when they ’re mad to learn .
See , the good thing about young children is they ’re passionate about life .
And , if you look at them , they ’re eager .
They run around grabbing things and you give them really good books when they ’re 5 years old — they ’re gonna eat it .
We ’ve got to teach children to eat books — to devour them — to be passionate about life by the time they ’re 6 years old in the first grade they ’re ready for all of life .
We ’re not doing it .
We ’ve got to change the whole educational system right now , completely , from top to bottom .
You can not learn by hearing .
You have to learn by reading .
So we ’ve got to eliminate hearing and the Internet and give books back into the hands —
I ’m dictating my books now .
I had a stroke a couple years ago ; I ca n’t type anymore .
So I dictate my books and it ’s terrible , cause I ca n’t see them .
And the next day , my daughter sends me the typed … I can look at it type and go through and correct it .
But I ’ve learned from dictating books , you cannot learn or dictate — it ’s wrong .
I do n’t like doing that .
It ’s changed my style ; it ’s changed my ideas .
I do n’t want to do it that way .
Wasserman :
Your observation reminds me that , with the passage of every technology , something ’s gained and something ’s lost .
I imagine an earlier period in human history when we went from an oral culture — from Homer and the responsibility of bards and poets to memorize whole poems and to pass them on in an oral tradition .
Once they decided to , you know , set down in parchment or in illuminated manuscripts , there were probably critics at the time who said , “ Oh , my God , we ’ve lost the facility to memorize , and no one will ever write a poem as good as “ The Odyssey ” or “ The Iliad , ” which could only have been concocted by someone who was committed to the oral tradition and to passing on , and probably someone bemoaned — now people are going to rely upon the crutch of the written word for what formerly they committed to memory .
And then I imagine that when we went from quill pens and parchment to typewriters , someone must have said , “ Oh , my God , we ’ve lost something very valuable . ”
The time it took to dip the quill into the ink — that was the pause that refreshed .
That was the moment for actual reflection .
And there were probably people who said , “ Now with the typewriter you ’d have no time actually to think about what you ’re going to say . ”
And similarly today with the computer and the older ways of doing things .
Bradbury : I had a sign over my typewriter 50 years ago which said , “ Do n’t think . ”
Typewriters help you write better because it all comes out .
You should be passionate .
All of my books are written by this interior self that wants to say something .
I never get in the way .
There are two mes : the Ray Bradbury who writes and the Ray Bradbury who watches .
So everything has to be passionate .
A typewriter helps you to … speak more quickly , more passionately , and more creatively .
You must n’t think — you must n’t brood over things .
You ’ll make up something that does n’t work .
You ’ll correct it .
You must not correct what you do .
You must throw up every morning and clean up every noon .
Wasserman :
Well , the computer arrived a little late , because a man with that attitude would , it seems to me , have embraced the computer with some enthusiasm , since the computer is a very fancy typewriter that makes things go very quickly and very fast .
And let me just go back to the question of newspapers for a moment , because there ’ve been so many cutbacks at the Los Angeles Times and they ’ve not been alone in this — the whole newspaper profession seems to be on its heels .
[ Have ] newspaper book reviews been important for you for your career ?
Are they of any interest whatsoever ?
Or could we as easily get along without them as perhaps we have with them ?
Bradbury : No , as a writer , I ’ve always ignored the reviews , because they ’re always wrong .
And even the right ones are wrong .
They love you for the wrong reasons .
So you must n’t read them .
So I turned down 200 reviews in the last 40 years , because I knew they could n’t help me .
It ’s too late .
I ’m already me !
The book ’s out — you ca n’t change that book by criticizing it .
It ’s too late !
You ’re too late for me .
If you could help by looking over my shoulder when I ’m throwing up , you could teach me to throw up better .
But those reviews can’t help me throw up , you see ?
Newspapers should teach us to be in love with life .
They ’re in the business of criticizing life too much .
They ’re too negative .
They do all the rapes and murders and destruction .
They ’re happier with tornadoes and the earthquakes .
I ’m sorry , but that does n’t teach me , help me to survive all that — teach me how to be in love every day of my life .
I only teach one thing to people :
Do the thing that you love , and love the thing that you do .
Do n’t do anything else .
Do n’t do anything for money .
Do n’t listen to anyone who gives you money and says , “ Do this . ”
Stop that !
You ca n’t do it .
You ’ve gotta do what you love .
I worked for Universal Studios 50 years ago .
They wanted me to work on a project , and I was suspicious of them .
And they gave me an idea and I sat down and said , “ What are you paying me every week — $ 300 ? ” I said , “ I ’ll tell you what I ’ll do : I ’ll do two scripts .
I ’ll do one for you and one for me .
At the end of 10 days , I ’ll turn them in , and by the way you choose the right one , I ’ll either stay or I ’ll go .
You ’ve gotta pick the right one to keep me . ”
So , I turned in two scripts in 10 days and they said , “ Wo n’t you choose ?
Do n’t you want us to choose the one that you love ? ” I said , “ Yes , I do , cause that ’s the right one ! ”
And luckily , they chose the right one .
I stayed on and we did “ It Came from Outer Space . ”
It ’s not a great film , it ’s a nice film , but if they ’d got out of the way even more it would have been better .
So , I ’m teaching people day by day , do n’t read the headlines , do n’t look at the newspaper — the negative things — look at the — there ’s gotta be a positive attitude by the newspaper not to be political all the time .
The Times was busy trying to destroy Schwarzenegger a couple years ago ; they should n’t have tried to do that .
That ’s not the function of the newspaper .
It ’s to inform us fully and completely about character .
And you must not be a critic unless there ’s a terrible crisis at hand .
But otherwise , do n’t turn on TV , cause it ’s disaster after disaster .
It does n’t work the same way .
Wasserman :
Well , with all due respect , I have to say — I have to say I have a principled disagreement with this view .
I would say that it ’s the responsibility of writers to explore character and it ’s the responsibility of news - gathering organizations , whether they exist on the Internet or whether they exist in what has been newspapers , to try to as best they can in a humanly fraught world , to describe the way we live now , the way we have lived and perhaps to explore how we might live and to thoroughly investigate the conditions by which our arrangements have been made , whether political or social , and to reveal to people the news , as I say earlier , that comes from elsewhere .
If I had n’t had reporters trying to get to the bottom of what the educational system is in , say , Los Angeles , I would never know that one out of every three kids drops out .
That ’s important news to know , it seems to me , in order to evaluate how politicians are fulfilling their responsibilities to creating a better city for all of us .
Bradbury :
You have to do both functions at the same moment .
Tell me that people are dropping out of school and tell me what to do at the same time .
Being negative and be positive at the same instant .
You must tell me what to do also and try to do it reflecting all sides : left , right and middle .
You ’ve got to reflect everything totally in a newspaper , not just one side .
Wasserman :
Well , I would agree in the sense that the newspaper or any kind of news - gathering institution should be a forum for a thoroughgoing public debate over all of these issues .
I do n’t think the newspaper alone has the mission or even the responsibility itself of telling the rest of us how to live .
We have to tell ourselves how we are to live , and we have to create a political system by which we can hold politicians accountable .
And it ’s they who are charged with developing the answers to the questions that a newspaper properly raises .
Bradbury :
But the newspaper has to do everything , though .
I have , by speaking my mind , changed six malls all over the United States .
I ’ve re-created downtown L.A. I wrote an article for the L.A. Times 30 years ago .
I put my design for the new L.A. in there , and the Glendale Galleria was built around my idea .
And they came and told me , “ Thank you for changing our minds . ” Century City is re-created by me .
I came in twice , I wrote and told them what was missing — there were n’t enough restaurants , there were n’t enough good things in the city .
And they rebuilt it twice — there are two articles on this ; that happened because I told them how to do it .
I told them things were terrible , here ’s what you must do to re-create Century City .
That ’s what newspapers have got to do : criticize , but then offer the solution .
And you ’ve got to believe it , though .
And they should n’t be political , they should be aesthetic .
Wasserman :
Well , that ’s I think where the concern comes from .
Because in a challenged economy , and a newspaper which finds its resources shrinking and its debt having increased , how are you going to continue to provide a forum and a space for concerned and activist and passionate citizens like yourself to propose solutions when there ’s less space , less energy and less ambition to do just the things you say ?
So , that ’s why it ’s something , I think , of a concern for many people , particularly in Los Angeles as the city grows and becomes ever more complicated .
Bradbury :
You have to speak up as an individual .
Right now , I ’m trying to save my country .
We have pollution all over the United States .
We ’re using oil and coal and were burning coal and making pollution .
I ’m going to write an article ; I want it featured in a major magazine , and the front cover should say “ Lafayette , Come Back ! ” I want to bring the French in to save the United States again .
They saved us 200 years ago .
Without the French , we ’d never have had an American Revolution .
I want a new revolution here — get rid of all the oil , all the coal , bring in nuclear power .
Bring the French technicians over , and they ’ll save the whole country !
I ’m gonna write this article ; it ’s gonna be talked about by both parties , and I can change my country , because I believe it right now .
And I ’m going to do this .
That ’s what newspapers should do ; that ’s what book sections should do .
You ’ve got to believe it like I believe it .
I think I can save my country right now .
Wasserman :
Well , the thing I ’ve always admired about you , Ray , is that , like Andre Gide once remarked to his journals , he said , “ I know I will have entered old age the moment I wake up and I ’m no longer angry . ”
And that you ’ve kept the capacity to wake up angry about the way the world is , is the single greatest reason for having hope in the future , and I thank you for it .
Bradbury : I ’m glad , thank you .
Wasserman :
Of the objects which fill this room with what I assume are 1,000 memories for you , are there any that leap out as you cast your eye around that you could tell me something about ?
Bradbury :
They are gifts from people who love me .
This dinosaur here is a Tyrannosaurus Rex which came from Japan from a sculptor there who carved it out of wood and sent it to me because dinosaurs have been the center of my life .
I saw them when I was 6 years old in movies ; I wrote about them when I was 30 ; I gave a copy of my dinosaur story to John Huston and he read it and said , “ My God !
That ’s Herman Melville . ”
And he gave me the job of writing “ Moby Dick ” because I love dinosaurs .
So , you have one right here .
It ’s a good example .
I ’ve got an Emmy award over here I won for “ The Halloween Tree . ”
Now , it ’s a result of my love .
See , everything in life should be love .
I fell in love with Halloween when I was 3 years old , and when I grew up , I began to paint pictures about the Halloween tree that was in my mind .
And I knew Chuck Jones , the animator — I had lunch with him 40 years ago cause I loved the cartoons he made for Warner Brothers .
My love was intense for Chuck Jones !
Halloween occurred the night before , and Chuck Jones said , “ Did you see that show on TV last night — ‘ The Great Pumpkin , Charlie Brown ? ’ ” I said , “ Yes — I hated it ! ”
He said , “ The pumpkin never showed up , did it ? ”
He said , “ Would you like to write a Halloween show for me ? ” I said , “ You want to make a cartoon ? ”
He said , “ Yes . ” I said , “ Wait there . ”
So I went home here , I brought him my big painting of the Halloween tree that I ’d done with my children down in the basement 30 years ago , and he looked at that painting and he said , “ Is n’t that the history of Halloween ?
Why do n’t we do a film about that painting ? ”
So I did a screenplay , and it was made into a film , and I ’ve turned it into a novel , and I got that Emmy because it represents my love .
See , my loves surround me here .
Everything is love .
If you look up here , there ’s all the best films made in the last 30 years are there .
I have formed three film societies in Hollywood myself during the last 20 , 30 years .
A film society for the writers , a film society for the actors , a film society for the directors , and now I ’m teaching people how to love films .
Three different film societies I formed .
One person did this ’ cause I was angry at the quality that was going on , and I changed the education then by forming the film societies and teaching people what to love .
There you have it .
Wasserman :
Well , now I want you , at your advanced and young age , to form three societies for the advancement of books and book reviewing :
One , a society for the critics to teach them how to criticize responsibly ; one , a society for the readers so that they can learn how to actually read responsibly , and three a society for the writers so that they can give us better stories .
Bradbury : Absolutely .
A book review could help do this .
A really great book review in the L.A .
Times with a great cover teaching love and promoting a new book that teaches you the love of life , and some of the other books can be inside . …
Then there can be a complete schedule again of all the major lectures is being given around L.A. every week so that people can go and meet the authors .
A book review can do this … but it ’s not doing it right now .
Wasserman :
But I still await the day that the UCLA Library will put a plaque for you in its basement where for — what was it , a nickel or a dime , feeding the typewriters that you were then too poor to afford yourself , you wrote , in what was it , three weeks … ?
Bradbury : Nine days .
Wasserman : … Nine days — “ Fahrenheit 451 . ”
Bradbury : Yeah .
They ’re gonna do that next month , I hear .
They ’re gonna give me a plaque , at long last .
Wasserman : Finally — congratulations .
Bradbury : Yeah .
Wasserman : Fifty - odd years after the original writing .
Bradbury :
That ’s right , yeah .
I want to make points about love here .
I love John Huston ; that ’s why I worked for him .
I did n’t meet him for years —
I was afraid of meeting him because I loved him — but I published three books .
I said to my agent , “ I want to have dinner with John Huston now . ”
I took my three books to dinner , I put them out on the table , I said , “ Mr. Huston , here ’s ‘ Dark Carnival , ’ here ’s ‘ The Martian Chronicles , ’ here ’s ‘ The Illustrated Man ’ — if you love these books half as much as I love you , hire me someday .
So , two years later , he hired me to do ‘ Moby Dick , ’ because I told him I loved him .
You see , you ’ve got to do this ; you ’ve got to do it more often , I say , Schwarzenegger — he ’s the governor of the state now because of me , because I [ professed ] my love .
I was on the Academy of Motion Pictures documentary committee 30 years ago .
We ran films and turned them off if we did n’t like them .
One night we were running a film called “ Pumping Iron , ” and they turned it off .
I was in the front row .
I turned and said , “ You sons of bitches !
Turn that film back on ! ” I said , “ You do n’t like weightlifters , you do n’t like bodybuilders , you do n’t like surfers .
I slept with one for 27 years ! ”
They said , “ What ? ! ” I said , “ My brother !
I grew up in Muscle Beach .
I know all these people , and this film is about Muscle Beach and the people that I knew and loved when I was a child , but you do n’t like — you ’re prejudiced against weightlifters .
Now , goddammit , I ’ve seen 10 minutes of the film — now it ’s worth seeing ! ”
I made them turn it back on , and it changed their minds , and Schwarzenegger got his start then .
I saved his skin that day .
You see what passion does ?
Love is everything !
I saved Schwarzenegger ’s skin , and now he ’s governor because of me .
Wasserman : Has he thanked you ?
Bradbury :
He was in an awards with me a couple years ago , and he heard this story I just told you .
He ran up on the stage and grabbed me and pulled me up by his arm and pulled it out of the socket with his love , yeah .
Everything is love — everything is love .
Your First 10 Words Are More IMPORTANT
Than YOUR Next 10,000 Words !
If you are old enough to remember ever sending a telegram , where you paid for every single letter / character and you had to telegraph your message in a such a succinct way to not only get your message understood , you also wanted to keep your costs down .
You had no room for waffle or fluff .
You had to get to the point – fast !
Today , on the internet , if you do a Google adword campaign , you have restrictions , 25 characters for your headline and 35 characters for your 2 lines which means you must cleary ‘ telegraph ’ your message to entice prospects to click your ad and go to your website .
Your salespeople can be the strong or the weak link in your company ’s sales chain .
If one link of a chain will hold fifty pounds , another thirty pounds , and another six pounds , altogether the chain can support only six pounds – the “ holding power ” of the weakest link .
It is like building a beautiful , sleek $ 200,000 automobile .
You can have the finest body engineers can create ; a powerful twin turbo charged engine
under the shiny hood ; stylish , leather upholstery , slick tires , and a gas tank filled with gasoline , yet the automobile will fail to start if some comparatively insignificant part in the ignition system fails to function .
So it is with a manufacturer , distributor , retailer or an entrepreneur .
They can employ high - salaried executives to direct their business ; they can staff theirs organization with the best creative , merchandising and advertising brains , yet their ultimate success is in the hands of their sales organization .
It is the salesman who is the real boss – the real cog in the machine .
What he or she says and does as he or she faces their prospects and your customers is
vitally important to the success of your business .
And their success depends , to a great extent , upon the words he or she uses in the field of selling .
On the internet , this is no different .
Your written words will determine your sales .
Below is part 2 on Tested Sentences That Sell .
Back in 1937 Corporations throughout America commissioned Elmer Wheeler to set up his “ Word Laboratories ” and find out winning sentences to sell their goods .
Wheeler realized it was the sales people in the stores who were n’t asking the right questions to their customers .
Wheelerpoint 2 : Do n’t Write – Telegraph
“ DON ’T WRITE – TELEGRAPH ” means :
Get Your prospects IMMEDIATE and FAVORABLE attention in the fewest possible words .
If you do n’t make your first message “ click , ” . . . your prospect will leave you mentally , if not physically .
A good sales presentation should use as few words as possible .
Any word which does not help to make the sale endangers the sale .
Therefore , make every word count by using “ telegraphic ” statements , as there is no time for “ letters . ”
Discover the WORD MAGIC of making your “ selling sentences ” sell !
How to Approach Your Prospects
People form ‘ snap judgments . ’
They make up their opinions about you in the first ten seconds , and this affects their entire attitude toward what you have to sell them .
Give them a brief “ telegram ” in these first ten seconds so their opinion will be in your favor .
Make the wires “ sing ” – so you , will be given the chance to “ follow up . ”
Wheeler found after analysing 105,000 sales words and techniques and actually noting the results of tests of them on 19,000,000 people , this is the “ magic ” used by most star salesmen who make single sentences sell !
For this example of this Wheelerpoint , let me again go back to the vacuum cleaner ,
( Wheelerpoint 1 ) and remembering the ten “ sizzles ” in this cleaner , let us see how we can formulate a couple of them into ten - second “ telegrams . ”
Here ’s a recap of the 10 sizzles for the vacuum cleaner :
See how many “ sizzles ” we can develop to get the prospect saying “ I want ! ” instead of “ Oh hum ! ” :
1. Positive Agitation .
2. Time - to Empty Signal .
3. Dirt Finder .
4. Automatic Rug Adjuster .
5. Non-kink Cord .
6. Instant Handle Positioner .
7. Non-tangle Revolving Brush .
8. Grit Removers .
9. Lint Removers .
10 . Dust Removers
“ The Grit Removers take out dirt you never knew you had . ”
“ You may forget to clean the bag , but the Time - to - Empty Signal wo n’t forget to remind you . ”
Summary of Wheeler Point 2
A good sales presentation consists of as few words as possible .
Telegrams which click Open your prospect ’s Mental Pocketbooks and their wallets !
If you hem and haw the “ sizzle , ” you will make few sales , for your prospects will walk away from you or complain that you are high - pressuring them !
REMEMBER :
YOUR FIRST 10 WORDS ARE MORE IMPORTANT THAN YOUR NEXT 10,000 !
Therefore , make your FIRST words make FIRST impressions by not STAMMERING and STUTTERING when you face your prospects .
They make “ snap judgments ” of you and your products or services by “ sizing you up ” with your first ten words .
It does n’t matter if you are face to face sales , selling online , your first 10 words are critical .
Bore your prospects for even a nano - second and you lose them forever .
First you use judgment in picking the right “ sizzle , ” and then you fit it to your prospect at hand .
You dress up the “ sizzle ” in a ten - second message and practice Wheelerpoint 2 , “ Do n’t write – TELEGRAPH . ”
The technique which goes with what you say will then come to you naturally and easily , as you will discover in the next Wheelerpoint .
Dedicated to kicking your ass until you succeed .
Warmly

Lily Allen Turns Pink Hair Brunette to Honor Grandmother ( Photos )
had a shock recently when her grandmother passed away on June 29 , 2008 .
Though the singers ' nan ' had been ill for several years , it was a blow to Allen , who was reportedly close to her .
In order to be respectable at her grandmother 's funeral , Allen dyed her fuchsia pink hair a dark shade of brunette .
Lily had gone pink from platinum blonde in early June .
She made the following entry on her MySpace page :
" I 'm back to black bitch .
I got bored of the pink .
I can't believe I 'm posting a blog about my hair .
You may have heard my nan passed away last weekend .
We were close and even though she had been very ill for the past few years , it was a big shock .
Anyway , the point is my nan would have killed me if I went to her funeral with pink hair so there is another reason . "
We offer our condolences to Lily Allen and her family during this difficult time .

The second session of the day that really appealed to me was “ An Open Source Project Called “ Failure : ” Community Antipatterns to Know and Avoid “ .
When I saw that Ben and Fitz of subversion fame were joined by other open source heavy weights , I was sold on this panel .
In this panel each member presented one anti-pattern in open source project , where an anti-pattern is a negative pattern that projects should aim to avoid .
Chromatic started off by talking about blocking patterns , where a blocking pattern occurs when someone in a project promises to do something , but does n’t actually fulfill that promise .
Once this happens other members of the project refrain from starting on this project themselves , because person X has promised to hack on it .
No one gets motivated to work on this piece of work and it starts blocking progress in the project .
Do n’t let anyone get an exclusive lock on a project !
Chromatic continued by giving two examples that show this anti-pattern :
When a bug presents someone from getting work done .
Certain bugs can preclude people from making progress — identifying and focusing on those bugs should keep the project moving .
When no one makes a decision that impedes progress .
Sometime continuing work depends on someone making a decision which could affect downstream work .
In order to avoid throwing work away , people will wait until a decision has been made .
Josh Berkus talked about a “ We do n’t need no stikin ’ docs ” anti-pattern .
While he presented his entire anti-pattern sarcastically , I ’ll tell you about his pattern straight out .
Josh talks about the flawed mentality that if something was hard to write it should be hard to understand .
That ’s obviously bogus — projects should aim to provide user documentation , contributor documentation , and developer documentation in order to make it easy for users to be drawn into the project and become contributors / developers .
Josh cited SQL Ledger as the a good example — the project has been around for 10 years , but there are no free docs .
You can purchase documentation , but no current free documentation exists .
Lack of usable documentation prevents open source projects from drawing in new participants .
Alan talked about projects screwing around with licenses as another anti-pattern .
Without licenses all projects have is shared source , that is ambiguous for use .
Licenses provide a social contract that tells people what they can do with your code .
Licenses also provide a legal contract suitable for defending your rights in court .
While most conflicts never see court and are resolved through peer - pressure , a legal backup is necessary in case peer pressure fails .
Alan gave the example of the XFree86 project that underpinned nearly all Linux distros a few years ago .
Then the board of the project started screwing around with its license and added a clause that forced people to awkwardly credit the XFree86 project .
With this move it started alienating its developers and a fork of the project happened shortly thereafter .
Today , XFree86 has only two developers and most distros have switched over to the forked version provided by X.org .
Brian Fitzpatrick talked about the “ Do n’t feed the trolls ” anti-pattern .
He shared the case of where a subversion user found a bug and reported the bug quite acerbically .
Calling the subversion developers names and insinuating much worse about their parents and grand - parents .
The Subversion developers asked details about the bug , which they received along with another helping of hate .
The bug was fixed and scheduled to go out with the next release .
Yet , the troll continued to spew hate , but the subversion team paid him no mind since the issue at hand ( the bug ) was fixed .
Soon thereafter , the troll left .
Ben Collins - Sussman talked about how partial subversion commit access is often times a bad idea , since it places trust into a grey zone .
Often times admins of subversion repositories ask how to setup partial commit access and Ben engages these people to find out their motivations .
He asks why they should not allow people to commit to the whole repository .
No one is going to sneak in a change , since other developers are watching for commits .
So what if a developer commits a change to some place where they should not be committing ?
Changes can easily be reverted , so why worry ?
If a developer commits code to the wrong place , someone can ascertain if that was an honest mistake or done purposefully .
Either way , engage people and talk to them .
Do n’t solve your social problems with technical solutions !
Karl Fogel presented the “ passive disinterest becomes active resistance ” anti-pattern .
In this pattern someone from the community suggests a feature that the developers think is a bad idea .
If the developers shoot down this idea the suggester may become confrontational and become troublesome in the community .
People like these may keep re-opening closed bugs and pestering developers as part of their active resistance .
Rather than shooting down the idea and stopping the suggestion cold in its tracks , Karl suggests that developers should instead encourage the suggester to expand on their idea .
Developers could say : “ Propose your idea , but you may not get much attention for your idea .
The developers may simply not implement it . ”
This does not block off the suggester and allows them to get the idea out , even if no one takes action on it .
I ’ve seen several of these patterns in the past few years of my open source work .
While some of these patterns are quite obvious ( its clear documentation is necessary to draw in developers ) other patterns like Chromatic ’s blocking pattern may not be obvious .
I ’ve had this happen to me when I first started working on FreeAmp back in the day .
Coming from a classical software development mentality I made a list of who promised to code what .
As predicted by Chromatic , this list became a “ who is slacking on this ” list and hampered development until I nuked the list .
Thanks for sharing your patterns , gang !
When Tech Fails : What to Do if Your Computer Wo n’t Turn On
In 2017 , 78 % of households had a computer or laptop .
77 % have a broadband Internet subscription .
Computers get used on a daily basis for everything from work , to play , to paying bills .
So when your computer wo n’t turn on , panicking is usually the next step .
Do you rely on a steady connection for any of the above reasons ?
Are you in desperate need of a quick fix ?
Sometimes , a few easy methods can do the trick .
Other times , you may have to call in the computer pros .
But either way , wait to freak out !
It ’s likely that your hard drive is okay .
Most issues with a computer booting have to do with something else .
Chances are , your files , photos , and precious documents should still be accessible .
Let ’s dive in !
Computer Wo n’t Turn On ?
There could be a few reasons for this :
A dead battery or unplugged battery charger
Issues with the motherboard
The computer keeps freezing due to loose hardware
Whatever the cause , a malfunctioning computer is a hassle .
Try these troubleshooting methods when you come across this annoying problem !
1. Check the Power Supply
Before you Google “ computer help near me , ” let ’s check out the power supply .
The solution may be something as simple as a faulty charger that needs replacing .
Fingers crossed !
Look for these tell - tale signs :
Are there any lights going on or off ?
Do you hear the fans whirring ?
Is your charger old or defective ?
Does a multimeter get a power input ?
Are you pretty tech - savvy ?
Then you might consider unplugging the power supply from the computer itself .
Remove the power supply from the computer .
Plug this into your typical outlet .
Do you see the pin connector that connects to the motherboard ?
Connect the green wire with the black one .
If the power supply is not kaput , then you ’ll hear the fans begin whirring .
If the power supply is dead , you wo n’t hear or see them moving .
2. Check the Screen Display
Do you see lights or hear fans , but your computer screen remains blank ?
This might be an issue with your screen display rather than your power supply .
Is your screen connected to anything else ?
Is it set to cast on your TV , for example ?
Try disconnecting this link by ensuring your TV ( or anything else ) is off .
Make sure your computer or laptop does n’t have anything else connected to it .
This can be a camera , your SD card , your phone .
Get your device as “ alone ” as possible .
If you ’re dealing with a desktop computer , try connecting it to a different monitor .
If the new monitor ’s display works , you ’ll know the problem lies with your monitor .
For laptop users , you may be stuck using the “ turn it off , turn it back on ” option .
Disconnect your battery ( and any other wires ) for at least 30 seconds .
Allow it to rest and restart before trying again .
3. Engage Safe Mode if Possible
Windows allows for its users to enter Safe Mode , even when the computer itself wo n’t boot .
When you ’re attempting to turn your computer on , hold down the F8 button as it ’s booting .
Or , go keyboard - happy and repeatedly click the F8 button .
( Only do this if your computer is n’t registering a hold on the button . )
Did F8 allow you to boot up ?
It ’s also recommended that if you ’ve recently installed new software , to uninstall it .
If All Else Fails
If your computer wo n’t turn on after attempting these methods , it may be time to call in the experts .
But if you do find a solution , the next step is safeguarding your computer from any future problems .

NEW YORK ( CNN ) --
Two teenage girls used DNA bar coding to determine that some sushi on New York dinner plates was mislabeled with cheaper fish being passed off as a more expensive species .
Results show that half of the restaurants and six of 10 grocery stores sold items that were mislabeled .
Kate Stoeckle and Louisa Strauss were not science majors or even college students when they decided to take 60 samples of seafood and use a genetic fingerprinting technique to see whether the fish were labeled correctly .
The graduates of Manhattan 's Trinity School in New York were inspired by Kate Stoeckle 's father , Mark , a scientist and proponent of the use of DNA bar coding , a technique that greatly simplifies the process of identifying a species .
" Growing up , bar coding was dinner conversation , so I was familiar with it , " Stoeckle said .
" And then one night , while out to dinner , I asked , could we barcode sushi ?
Louisa and I love sushi , and we thought , why not apply the bar coding technology to see what food we 're eating ? "
After collecting samples from four restaurants and 10 grocery stores , spending about $ 300 , the teens sent them to the University of Guelph in Ontario , Canada , where the Barcode of Life project began and where a graduate student had agreed to conduct the genetic analysis .
The girls ' samples were compared with the global library of 30,562 bar codes representing nearly 5,500 fish species .
According to Mark Stoeckle , DNA is extracted chemically .
The bar code gene , a chemical code , is amplified in a process called Polymerase Chain Reaction .
A machine examines the DNA sequences called bases , which are a series of letters , A , G , C and T , and then digitally matches them with a library of DNA bar codes or other series of letters .
The bar code itself is very long , with 648 letters .
The results showed that 25 percent of the girls ' samples were mislabeled : half of the restaurant samples and six out of 10 grocery store samples .
In every case , less desirable or cheaper fish was substituted for its more expensive counterpart , Stoeckle said .
She and her father would not divulge the names of vendors , citing a fear of lawsuits .
" It 's not the fishermen , and it might not even be the restaurants , " she said .
" Most likely , the mislabeling is occurring somewhere at the distribution level . "
For example , fish sold as white tuna turned out to be cheaper Mozambique tilapia , flying roe fish was replaced with smelt , and red snapper was mislabeled as Atlantic cod and Acadian redfish , an endangered species .
" They are the first to do it , " Mark Stoeckle said of the girls .
" It 's like ' CSI ' for fish . "
He said the process could become as common as GPS .
" Many people are working on miniaturizing it , bring the cost down and the speed to process up , " he said .
" Sequencing is a chemical process .
There is no reason why we can't check the food on our plate [ and ] send the signal out to a database electronically .
GPS used to be as big as refrigerators and only used by the government .
Now it 's a common application in a phone . "
The students worked under Jesse H. Asusubel of Rockefeller University , a champion of DNA bar coding .
They say the project was n't work .
" It did n't feel like a chore .
It was n't time - consuming at all , " Stoeckle said .
" I 'm hoping to get more public interest so it can become cheaper and more common . "
Asked whether she 's less inclined to eat sushi , she said , " I 've eaten it , like , 50 times since , so I do n't think so . "

The cost of living , led by the soaring cost of gasoline and food , is rising at the fastest rate since the recession of the early 1990s , the government said on Thursday , handing a de facto pay cut to the American worker .
The report , from the Labor Department , offered quantitative proof of what Americans have been feeling for months : almost everything costs more , even as they have less money to pay for it .
Prices of a wide range of common products in the Consumer Price Index were 5.6 percent higher last month than they were in July 2007 , the sharpest annual increase since January 1991 .
Much of the increase has been driven by the immense run-up in gasoline prices .
But food , beverage and transportation costs are also significantly higher than they were a year ago .
NOTE : this article was published long ago and is probably way out of date with respect to how Skype plugins are created now .
You may find it interesting for historical purposes only !
Introduction
A while ago , I became interested in looking at the Skype API , and found that it has a reasonably solid plugin architecture .
Support for a Java - based API is coming along , although it seems to lag the C++ and C# implementations slightly .
One of the reasons for this is ( somewhat bizarre , in my opinion ) API implementation chosen by Skype themselves – text - based API “ commands ” ( such as ALTER CALL , GET PROFILE , etc ) are translated into Win32 window messages , which are dispatched and picked up by the Skype window ’s own event loop – a fairly ugly and dated form of IPC , which is made a bit more palatable by their COM wrapper implementation ( also used by C# ) .
The Linux version uses a different API – again , not ideal .
However , the API does support quite comprehensive automation and callback facilities .
Writing a Plugin
In order to be able to get started writing a Skype plugin , you will need at a minimum :
A C++ compiler – I used Visual C++ Express 2005 ;
The Skype4COM libraries .
I also downloaded the excellent Boost library for some C++ extensions ( especially relating to date and time handling ) .
I further installed WTL for some useful COM and ATL helpers .
Getting Started
The first thing you will need to do is register the COM server .
After you have extracted the files from the Skype4COM distribution , go to the directory where the files have been extracted and run regsvr32 skype4com.dll .
A message box should appear confirming successful registration .
For convenience , I installed the COM DLL in $ WINDIR / system32 for convenience , as it then is always available on the default system path for dynamic loading .
We are writing an application that makes use of COM , and my favourite way to write COM apps has always been to create a standard Win32 project and then let ATL / WTL take care of the COM boilerplate .
I originally read about this technique in Beginning ATL 3 COM Programming years ago , of which I can see a used copy currently on Amazon for sale for 83 cents !!!
If you install the WTL AppWizard as per the installation instructions , you can begin a project using the project template below :
You will then need to add any necessary includes and import the Skype COM type library using the import directive in Visual C++.
Here is a snippet from my stdafx.h header file :
#include < atlbase.h> # include < atlapp.h > extern CAppModule _Module ; #include < atlwin.h > # include < atlcom.h > # include < atlhost.h> # include < atlctrls.h > # include < atlctrlw.h > # include < atlframe.h >
# include < atldlgs.h > #import " c : \\ windows \\ system 32 \\ skype4com.dll " named_guids using namespace SKYPE4COMLib ;
This will allow Visual C++ to generate smart pointer wrappers for the COM interfaces .
The main source .cpp file ( generated by the WTL AppWizard ) contains the program ’s main message handler loop :
#include " stdafx.h " # include " resource.h " # include " aboutdlg.h " # include " MainDlg.h " CAppModule _Module ; int Run( LPTSTR /* lpstrCmdLine */ = NULL , int nCmdShow = SW_SHOWDEFAULT ) { CMessageLoop the Loop ; _ Module.AddMessageLoop( &theLoop ) ; CMainDlg dlgMain ; if ( dlgMain. Create ( NULL ) == NULL ) { ATLTRACE ( _T (
" Main dialog creation failed !
" ) ) ; return 0 ; } dlgMain.ShowWindow( nCmdShow ) ; int nRet = the Loop .
Run ( ) ; _Module.RemoveMessageLoop ( ) ; return nRet ; } int WINAPI _tWinMain( HINSTANCE hInstance , HINSTANCE /* hPrevInstance */ , LPTSTR lpstrCmdLine , int nCmdShow ) { HRESULT hRes = :: CoInitialize ( NULL ) ; //
If you are running on NT 4.0 or higher you can use the following call instead to // make the EXE free threaded .
This means that calls come in on a random RPC thread .
// HRESULT hRes = ::CoInitializeEx ( NULL , COINIT_MULTITHREADED ) ; ATLASSERT( SUCCEEDED( hRes ) ) ; // this resolves ATL window thunking problem when Microsoft Layer for Unicode ( MSLU ) is used ::DefWindowProc ( NULL , 0 , 0 , 0L ) ; AtlInitCommonControls ( ICC_BAR_CLASSES ) ; // add flags to support other controls hRes = _ Module .
Init( NULL , h Instance ) ; ATLASSERT( SUCCEEDED( hRes ) ) ; int nRet = Run(lpstrCmdLine , nCmdShow ) ; _Module.Term ( ) ; :: CoUninitialize ( ) ; return nRet ; }
Using the Skype Interfaces
Our main class is CMainDlg .
We can now declare an instance of the Skype COM class in our class , using one of the ATL smart pointers that Visual C++ has generated for us ( see the ATL documentation for more details on what it generates ) :
class CMainDlg : public CDialogImpl< CMainDlg > , public CUpdateUI < CMainDlg > , ... { private : ... public : enum { IDD = IDD_MAINDLG } ; ISkypePtr ptr ;
We can now use this interface pointer to connect to the running Skype instance and send it commands :
HRESULT hr ; hr = ptr.CreateInstance ( __uuidof( Skype ) ) ; if ( FAILED ( hr ) ) { MessageBox ( " Failed to create Skype instance !
" , " Error " ) ; exit (- 1 ) ; } ... hr = ptr->Attach ( SKYPE_PROTOCOL_VERSION , true ) ; if ( SUCCEEDED ( hr ) ) { OutputDebugString ( " Connected to Skype
" ) ; }
Event Callbacks
If we have connected OK , we can also register for event callbacks .
The most fundamental set of callbacks are the callbacks related to change in call status .
Unfortunately , COM event handling can be tricky to get right , although ATL / WTL can alleviate some of the pain .
Basically , the main class CMainDlg needs to extend the IDispEventImpl class , passing a reference to the dispatch interface that declares the events we are interested in :
public IDispEventImpl<IDD_MAINDLG , CMainDlg , &DIID__ISkypeEvents , &LIBID_SKYPE4COMLib , 1 , 0 >
We then create a COM event sink map for the event (s ) :
BEGIN_SINK_MAP( CMainDlg ) SINK_ENTRY_EX( IDD_MAINDLG , DIID__ISkypeEvents , 0x8 , & OnCallStatusChange ) END_SINK_MAP ( )
Finally , we need to actually tell Skype we are interested in the events :
// Hook up for event notifications hr = DispEventAdvise ( ptr ) ; if ( FAILED ( hr ) ) { ... }
The actual details of COM event sinks and connection points is beyond the scope of this article , and can be a bit involved ( for instance you may need to use the OLE / COM Type Library Viewer utility to view the dispatch interface details ) but both MSDN and the COM book referenced above have good examples .
Our actual event callback looks like the following :
void __stdcall OnCallStatusChange ( ICall* pCall , enum TCallStatus status ) { std::ostringstream str ; USES_CONVERSION ; if ( status == clsInProgress ) { //
A call has been initiated .
} else if ( status == clsRouting ) { } else if ( status == clsRinging ) { } else if ( status == clsFailed ) { } else if ( status == clsFinished ) { } }
Within the callback , we can retrieve a handle to the call or counterparty and use the information contained within these objects .
For instance , the code below creates an instance of a CallInfo object and populates it with data retrieved from the Call and User objects ( the ugly BSTR ( ) and LPCTSTR casting is not ideal , but the only way I could effectively cast the COM BSTR to an ANSI string – if you know a better way , please let me know ) .
For instance , the CallInfo struct below has fields for the call counterparty , id , duration , and user country .
if ( status == clsInProgress ) { str << " Call in progress with " << ( LPCTSTR ) OLE2T( pCall->PartnerHandle.GetBSTR( ) ) ; IUserPtr user = ptr->GetUser( pCall->PartnerHandle ) ; CallInfo* callInfo = new CallInfo( ) ; callInfo-> call
Id = pCall ->
Id ; callInfo-> duration = 0L ; std::string * country = new std::string( OLE2T(user->Country.GetBSTR( ) ) ) ; callInfo->callerCountry = country ; ... }
When the call has finished , we can retrieve the call duration :
else if ( status == clsFinished ) { str << " Call # " << pCall ->
Id << " finished , duration : " << pCall -> Duration << " seconds . " ; //
Retrieve the call from the active calls list CallList :: const_iterator it = calls.find( pCall ->
Id ) ; if ( it == calls.end ( ) ) { OutputDebugString ( " Call Id not found ! " ) ; return ; } CallInfo* callInfo = it -> second ; callInfo-> duration = pCall -> Duration ;
The sample program available for download below contains a very simple example , which basically displays some call - related information as and when Skype reports it .
I originally had planned to make it a bit more ambitious , and attempt to deduce the potential costs savings of making a Skype call vs. a fixed - line call on a standard BT tariff , but this proved unreliable for a few different reasons :
The callee ’s profile may not have a country field ;
If present , the country field may be incorrect ;
It is unclear whether it is more appropriate to compare mobile or fixed tariffs .
However , I have left the code in there .
Running the Plugin
If Skype is running , compile and run the plugin .
You should see a dialog appear like the following :
Once you have connected , the plugin dialog should appear , and you can see event callbacks as they happen ( just make and receive calls as normal ) :
Wrapping Up
In short , Skype offers fairly decent plugin functionality .
However , the actual plugin architecture is clunky and dated , and inconsistent across platforms .
I suspect that Skype will spend some time in the future on developing a richer and more uniform API across all platforms , that is not tightly coupled to the Skype GUI .

A store owner was tacking a sign above his door that read “ Puppies for sale . ”
Signs like that have a way of attracting small children , and sure enough , a little boy appeared under the store owner ’s sign .
“ How much are you going to sell the puppies for ? ” he asked .
The store owner replied , “ Anywhere from $ 30.00 to $ 50.00 . ”
The little boy reached in to his pocket and pulled out some change .
“ I have $ 2.37 , ” he said .
“ Can I please look at them ? ”
The store owner smiled and whistled and out of the kennel came Lady , who ran down the aisle of his store followed by five teeny , tiny balls of fur .
One puppy was lagging considerably behind .
Immediately the little boy singled out the lagging , limping puppy and said , “ What ’s wrong with that little dog ? ”
The store owner explained that the veterinarian had examined the little puppy and had discovered it did n’t have a hip socket .
It would always limp .
It would always be lame .
The little boy became excited .
“ That is the puppy I want to buy . ”
The store owner said , “ No , you do n’t want to buy that little dog .
If you really want him , I ’ll just give him to you . ”
The little boy got quite upset .
He looked straight into the store owner ’s eyes , pointed his finger and said , “ I do n’t want you to give him to me .
That little dog is worth every bit as much as all the other dogs and I ’ll pay full price .
In fact , I ’ll give you $ 2.37 now , and 50 cents a month until I have him paid for . ”
The store owner countered , “ You really do n’t want to buy this little dog .
He is never going to be able to run and jump and play with you like the other puppies . ”
To his surprise , the little boy reached down and rolled up his pant leg to reveal a badly twisted , crippled left leg supported by a big metal brace .
He looked up at the store owner and softly replied , “ Well , I do n’t run so well myself , and the little puppy will need someone who understands ! ”
The moral of this story is we all need someone who understands .
SAN JOSE , California – Plug - in hybrids are a great way to ease our oil addiction and do something about global warming .
But it 's taken 10 years for conventional hybrids like the iconic Toyota Prius to eke out almost 3 percent of the domestic market , and nothing suggests cars with cords will take hold any faster .
For that reason , plug - in advocates say , we 've got to figure out how to start converting a sizable chunk of the nation 's 240 million cars into gas - electric hybrids you can plug into a wall socket .
There 's a handful of companies venturing down this path , but they charge as much as 12 grand to do the job and the number of cars they 've converted would fit inside a Toyota cargo ship with room to spare .
That , according to Andy Grove , the former chairman and CEO of Intel , simply will not do .
He 's become one of the country 's most high - profile plug - in evangelists , reading from a sermon published last month in The American .
Now he 's issued a Herculean challenge during the Plug - In 2008 conference that had many in the choir singing " Hallelujah ! "
He 's called on automakers , utilities , researchers and pretty much everyone in Silicon Valley to develop a plan to convert 10 million pickup trucks , vans and SUVs to plug - in hybrids within four years .
And he says they should hand it to the next president on Jan. 21 .
The scale of what Grove has suggested would be difficult to overstate .
After all , Toyota 's been cranking out the Prius for a decade and only recently saw it 's one - millionth model leave a showroom .
General Motors is throwing nearly everything it has at the Chevrolet Volt so it can start selling them – in the low tens of thousands at most and at what undoubtedly will be a loss – by the end of 2010 .
So how does Grove – and those who hailed him for his chutzpah – propose doing things any faster ?
By making it a national priority along the lines of the moon shot .
Or a program akin to the New Deal .
Only that level of commitment – and investment – will overcome the challenges to so radically transforming the nation 's transportation fleet , they say .
Grove 's suggestions include :
A federal tax credit covering half the cost of retrofitting a vehicle , funded by licensing fees on all vehicles , boats and airplanes .
Free electricity for plug - in hybrids for as long as two years .
An open source approach ( which some advocates already employ for home conversions ) to developing the technology , and a new federal court to handle intellectual property issues stemming from the development of such vehicles .
Greater investment by venture capitalists to spur innovation in the field .
Support from the Small Business Administration and others to help launch the industry .
Let 's assume for the sake of argument the utilities , the automakers , the battery manufacturers , the growing number of plug - in conversion companies and everyone else with an interest in bringing about the inevitable electrification of the automobile can hammer out a plan in four months .
And let 's assume the next president not only reads it , but enacts it .
Then what ?
Supporters of Grove 's idea suggest starting with the fleets – taxi cabs , delivery vans , municipal vehicles .
They get lousy mileage , so the return on investment through reduced operating costs will come much faster , and economies of scale will reduce costs .
And since a relatively small number of models - the Ford Crown Victoria , variants of Ford 's F - Series trucks , etc. – comprise the majority of fleet vehicles , it 'll minimize R&D costs .
That 's the approach John Dabels , CEO of conversion start - up EV Power Systems , has taken .
" We are focusing on trucks because trucks consume more fuel and , frankly , no one else is doing this , " he says .
The company is beta - testing a kit that bolts right on behind the transmission with no modification to the engine , emissions system or other major components .
Dabels claims the $ 11,000 conversion delivers a 33 percent increase in fuel economy and " we 're reasonably comfortable with getting to 40 . "
Once you 've started that project , Grove 's acolytes say , expand the campaign to conventional hybrids – add a cord to your Prius and you 'll bump your fuel economy from 60 mph to about 100 mpg – because the job is relatively easy .
( Advocates of the cars converted a Prius in the parking lot of the Los Angeles Auto Show last year .
That 's them in the picture . )
Google 's been testing a small fleet of converted plug - in Prius and Ford Escape hybrids for about a year now and seen a 50 - percent increase in fuel economy over the standard versions .
" We 've put about 50,000 miles on them without any real problems , " says Alec Proudfoot , the guy running the program .
" The cars have performed beautifully . "
Once the conversion of fleets and hybrids is underway , plug - in proponents say , you go after everyone else .
" The low - hanging fruit is out there , " says Felix Kramer , founder of the plug - in advocacy group Cal Cars .
" There are millions of battered vehicles out there to be converted . "
He and other conversion advocates say converted vehicles will hasten the day when automakers fill their showrooms with plug - in hybrids by providing them with a wealth of data regarding how the vehicles perform , how consumers use them and what 's needed to keep them going .
But where are we going to get the batteries ?
How do we ensure converted vehicles meet federal safety standards ?
Who 's going to perform all these conversions , who 's going to provide the training to do it and what guarantees will consumers have that the cars will keep running five or 10 years down the line ?
And perhaps the biggest question of all - what 's it going to cost and how are we going to pay for it ?
" Ten million conversions at a cost of $ 10,000 ( each ) ?
That 's $ 100 billion , " says Tom Molinski , manager of emerging technology for Manitoba Hydro .
" How much does the U.S. spend on defense ?
How much has it spent on Iraq ?
At some point we have to ask , ' What 's the cost of not doing this . ' "

As Al Gore remarked in his landmark speech this past Thursday , the United States has the potential to generate all of its electricity from renewable resources within its borders .
As the Goracle put it :
Scientists have confirmed that enough solar energy falls on the surface of the earth every 40 minutes to meet 100 percent of the entire world 's energy needs for a full year .
Tapping just a small portion of this solar energy could provide all of the electricity America uses .
And enough wind power blows through the Midwest corridor every day to also meet 100 percent of US electricity demand .
Geothermal energy , similarly , is capable of providing enormous supplies of electricity for America .
According to the Energy Information Administration , the average American household in the US consumes about 920 killowat - hours of electricity per month .
So where , exactly , will all this energy come from ?
And how do we get it from there into our wall outlets ?
That 's where my new favorite website comes in .
The National Renewable Energy Laboratory , part of the US Department of Energy , offers a wealth of data about America 's capacity for all kinds of nonfossil , nonnuclear energy solutions , including solar , wind , .
( A big hat - tip to the Sietch Blog for directing me there . )
The NREL 's site has hundreds of maps detailing America 's potential for various types of sustainable energy .
Take this map of annual solar radiation , which I downloaded here .
As you can see , the greatest potential for large - scale solar is in the Southwest , much of it on federal land .
Much of the rest of the country , with the exception of Alaska , a portion of the Pacific Northwest , and the Northeast , also has excellent solar capacity .
But the people in these regions wo n't be left out .
As you can see from this next map ( which I downloaded here ) , those very regions that get the least amount of sunlight have the strongest winds .
Much of the East Coast and the Great Lakes region has " outstanding " capacity , while the capacity on the northern West Coast and Alaska is classified as " outstanding " or " superb . "
And much of the Midwest is " good " or " excellent . "
Gore also mentioned geothermal energy , an often - overlooked resource that , unlike wind and solar , does not depend on the weather .
Because geothermal plants can work continuously , day and night , they make ideal base - load plants .
This map ( downloaded here ) shows the estimated subterranean temperatures at a depth of 6 kilometers , or about 3.7 miles , below the earth 's surface .
Biomass energy has also gotten a bad rap lately , mostly because it has been accused of driving up global food prices .
But there 's more to biomass than just food crops .
Leftover residue from crops , timber forests , and mills can be turned into combustible fuels , as can methane emissions from landfills , manure , and sewage treatment plants .
Biomass energy is usually considered carbon - neutral .
Carbon from the atmosphere is absorbed by biomass via photosynthesis , and the same amount is released back into the atmosphere when it is burned .
The following map , downloaded from here , shows America 's biomass resources .
Further down the road , hydrogen shows great potential .
Now , despite frequent news reports to the contrary , hydrogen is not a source of renewable energy ( except for some heavy isotopes used in nuclear power ) , but it is a carrier that can be used to store energy .
It 's the most abundant element in the universe , but it is almost always found as a compound , such as water .
Separating hydrogen atoms from these compounds requires energy – at least as much energy as you 're going to get from the resulting hydrogen .
So why bother doing it ?
Because if you can use renewable energy , such as wind or solar , to split hydrogen from compounds , then you 've got a great storage medium whose delivery of carbon - free electricity is not dependent on the weather .
Take a look at this map of renewable - to - hydrogen potential , downloaded from here .
It 's no coincidence that this looks a lot like the wind - power map .
NREL is currently working on a wind - to - hydrogen project , exploring the potential of using wind turbines to power electrolysis , that is , separating hydrogen and oxygen in water molecules , and then using the resulting hydrogen to power internal combustion engines that produce electricity .
As Mr. Gore pointed out , one of the biggest impediments to getting renewable electricity from solar and wind farms to our wall sockets is our aging transmission lines .
In his speech , Gore cited a report – probably this one from the Electric Power Research Institute [ PDF ] – that says that our current grid system costs US businesses more than $ 120 billion a year .
" It has to be upgraded anyway , " Gore said .
Upgrading our electric grid does not require any new technology .
Nor does installing photovoltaic panels , or building solar thermal concentrators , wind farms , geothermal plants , and biomass converters .
All it requires is money – about $ 1.5 trillion to $ 3 trillion , by Gore 's estimate – and political will .
And , as these maps suggest , the United States has enough potential within its borders to fulfill its energy needs – without any efficiency measures beyond improving the grid .
We could go even further than that .
Imagine , just for a moment , what the world would look like if America were to become an exporter of energy .
Many commentators , including T. Boone Pickens and Hillary Hillary Clinton , have said that the United States has the potential to become the Saudi Arabia of wind .
Saudi Arabia , it should be noted , has no personal income tax .
As the opening ceremonies in Beijing showcased performances and fireworks to mark the start of the Olympic Games , not everyone joined in the celebration .
Thousands of people took part in human rights protests around the world to call for improved rights for Tibetans .
An angry protester chanted in front of the Chinese Embassy in Washington , D.C .
Apple on Monday evening released iPhone 2.0.1 Software Update , the first maintenance and security update for iPhone 3Gs and first - generation iPhones running iPhone Software 2.0 .
iPod touch 2.0.1 has also been released .
To download and install the 249.2MB update , connect your iPhone or iPod touch to your Mac or PC and select it in iTunes .
Then hit the " Check for Update " button .
iTunes will initiate a grueling backup of your existing iPhone 's software before installing the the update .
In a scant set of release notes , Apple said iPhone Software 2.0.1 and its iPod equivalent deliver " bug fixes . "
Readers are encouraged to post their experiences and findings while using the new software in the forums thread for this article .
Some changes
Apple does not always specify the changes it makes in minor software updates .
As such , the company leaves users guessing and trying to decipher those changes on their own .
Some user - discovered changes in iPhone / iPod 2.0.1 include :
- You can now drag an app icon across multiple pages in one motion , rather than having to drag it , drop it , pick it up again and drag it over to next page , and repeat .
- Contacts are now more responsive .
- After installing 2.0.1 , each successive backup is much faster .
- Apple may have changed the calibration of the iPhone 's reception " bars " while connected to a 3G network to reflect a stronger signal than before .
- Keypad loads quicker .
- Screen rotation in Safari appears to be smoother .
Set in the far future , Earth ’s appetite for natural resources has become a major motivator for deep space exploration .
Immense , privately - owned and operated mining ships called “ planetcrackers ” orbit planets and use sophisticated equipment to carve out entire city - sized chunks of rock , reducing them to component elements and raw ore .
When communications go dead onboard the USG Ishimura , a famous planetcracker , systems engineer Isaac Clarke is sent in to fix the problem .
Once onboard the vessel , Isaac discovers that the crew has unearthed an ancient and malevolent alien presence far beneath the planet ’s surface and brought it onboard .
Weaponless , alone and terrified , this lone engineer is burdened with much more than simple survival – he must seal the alien horror back into the dark rock .
The Dead Space team has watched a ton of horror and science fiction films while making the game , and now they want to pass on their collection .
From 12 Monkeys to The Exorcist , from Psycho to Slaughterhouse Five ; these are the top movies inspiring the grotesque thrills and twisted story behind the upcoming video game :

Doc : US Rep.
Tubbs Jones in critical condition after aneurysm RAW STORY
Published : Wednesday August 20 , 2008
Print This Email This
Paper , Dem official initially wrongly reported lawmaker 's death
Democratic U.S. Rep. Stephanie Tubbs Jones , the first black woman to represent Ohio in Congress , was hospitalized Wednesday after suffering an aneurysm , her spokeswoman said .
There was confusion as to Tubbs Jones ' condition Wednesday afternoon , with her hometown newspaper reporting that she had passed away followed by hospital officials saying she was still alive but in critical condition .
Doctors at Huron Hospital near Cleveland determined that Tubbs Jones has " very limited brain function , " Dr. Gus Kious said during a news conference televised on CNN around 2:30 p.m .
" She remains in critical condition at present . "
Around 1 p.m. Wednesday , the Cleveland Plain Dealer ran an anonymously sourced report that Tubbs Jones had died after being removed from life support .
A Democratic official in Washington also told reporters that Tubbs Jones died , resulting in this Associated Press NewsAlert .
It was unclear where the Democratic official got his or her information , but AP killed the alert of her death when a doctor said she was in critical condition .
That post apparently became the basis for subsequent reports of her death .
It was unclear whether Tubbs Jones was still connected to life support .
Tubbs Jones , 58 , had the aneurysm while driving her car in Cleveland Heights on Tuesday , spokeswoman Nicole Williams said .
The congresswoman 's condition had been stabilized at a hospital in East Cleveland , her spokeswoman Nicole Williams said at the time .
According to a statement from police , the lawmaker had been driving erratically and her vehicle crossed from the northbound lanes across the southbound lanes .
An officer pulled a cruiser across the roadway to warn oncoming traffic .
The officer reached her vehicle and found Tubbs Jones in medical distress , the statement said .
Tubbs Jones , first elected in 1998 , was one of Sen.
Hillary Rodham Clinton 's biggest boosters during the primaries and was to be a superdelegate at next week 's Democratic National Convention in Denver .
She went to Congress from the heavily Democratic 11th District around Cleveland .
With wire services .
It seemed an ordinary day at Google 's offices in Tel Aviv , Israel .
Until an alarming discrepancy glued eyes to computer screens .
Google Hot Trends is a feature intended to give ' a snapshot of what 's on the public 's collective mind ' , according to the internet giant , by displaying the fastest - rising search terms on the web .
Top of the list was not Batman , iPhone or sex .
It was not a word at all .
It was a swastika .
Somehow , the icon appropriated by Nazi Germany , not readily found on computer keyboards , had caught all - powerful Google napping .
The company was forced to issue an apology over the failure of its automated system to ' identify and remove inappropriate or offensive material ' , leaving its engineers to manually take down the symbol after two hours .
How did the swastika get there ?
Why did so many people search for it at the same time ?
It was a demonstration of how peculiar fads , jokes or videos can come out of nowhere and run riot across the web .
Such phenomena are known as ' memes ' - cultural fragments that catch someone 's eye , get forwarded to friends and spread like a virus .
The invisible hand behind many memes , apparently including the googled swastika , is a website called 4 chan .
From semi-literate cats to the ' ironic ' comeback of singer Rick Astley , this online community is building a reputation as a nursery of all that is weird and wacky and likely to be landing in your inbox tomorrow .
Suddenly , 4 chan 's elusive creator found himself the subject of articles in two of America 's heavyweight publications :
Time magazine and the Wall Street Journal , which named him as Christopher Poole , a New Yorker who was only 15 when , with the help of his mother 's credit card , he launched 4 chan from his bedroom five years ago .
Time hailed him as the ' Master Of Memes ' and described 4 chan as ' the wellspring from which a lot of internet culture , and hence popular culture , bubbles ' .
But how does it work ?
4 chan began as a simple message board with pictures and text .
Anyone could contribute on any subject , posting a photograph of their pet , sounding off about a politician , debating the merits of a player .
Sometimes other users will reply and begin a strand of conversation .
The images and comments now appear under 44 topic headings ranging from fashion , sports and video games to weapons , the paranormal and ' sexy beautiful women ' - the most popular by a long way is ' Random ' .
Inspired by a forum in Japan , the site has an unpolished retro look , as rough and ready as a scrapbook .
It is an online community at its purest and rawest , the antithesis of polished networks such as Facebook : 4 chan is like a brick wall where people can daub graffiti without fear of a comeback .
Child pornography is banned , but otherwise there are few rules .
Some posts are gloriously childish and nonsensical .
Others can be racist , homophobic and misogynistic and peppered with four - letter words .
Unlike most social networks , no one has to register a name or sign in .
Consequently , the community has been described as a lawless Wild West of the web , a place of uninhibited bawdiness and verbal violence .
A teenager in Texas posted a photograph of hoax pipe bombs and a threat to blow up his school on the anniversary of 9/11 , but another user contacted police and the teenager was arrested .
However , the free - for - all has also been liberating , turning 4 chan into an ideas laboratory and unleashing a ferocious creative force .
Though most of what appears soon vanishes and is forgotten , the stuff that survives can easily jump to the wider web community and ' go viral ' , passing from person to person across the world .
It is an ability envied by advertising agencies , which have long sought to drum up publicity by word of mouth or now through viral videos of their own , relying on users to do the work for them .
But 4 chan just does it for fun with the help of a big army of users : 8.5 million page views a day and 3.3 million visitors a month .
The swastika was one such stunt .
It appears that a post on 4 chan instructed people to Google '...# 21328 ; '.
When thousands did , they discovered that it was a piece of code which , when processed by a web browser , translates into a swastika .
Their collective curiosity unwittingly sent the symbol soaring to the top of Google 's Hot Trends .
One of 4 chan 's biggest hits is a prank known as ' bait - and - switch ' .
You receive a link to an ' amazing website ' .
But when you click , it is in fact a link to a music video for Rick Astley 's 1987 hit single ' Never Gonna Give You Up ' .
It is estimated that more than 10 million people have been ' rickrolled ' .
The first such joke on 4 chan was ' duckrolling ' , in which a link to a popular celebrity or news item would instead lead to a photomontage of a duck with wheels .
In another parade of silliness , 4 chan users began a Saturday ritual of posting pictures of cats , for no particular reason except that they could .
This soon became known as ' Caturday ' , with humorous phrases posted beside the so - called ' LOLcats ' - now the subject of LOLcat T - shirts , buttons and fridge magnets .
When a plump grey cat appeared with the caption ' I can has cheezburger ? ' , it caught the imagination of a man in Hawaii and became the subject of his blog , icanhascheezburger.com .
The blog was sold for about $ 2 m ( £ 1 m ) .
Last week 4 chan was at it again .
The site rallied users to search for ' Scientology is a cult ' and , written upside down , the words ' fuck you Google ' .
Again , both leapt to the top of Google Hot Trends before being removed .
4 chan users were also accused of attacking Habbo , a virtual world for children , by flooding it with avatars made to look like black men wearing Armani suits .
In a previous raid , they lined up avatars to form the shape of a swastika .
Poole had never revealed his identity until Time and the Wall Street Journal came calling .
When contacted by The Observer through email , he replied : ' I am extremely busy this week and will not have time to conduct a phone interview . '
He suggested questions by email but did not respond to them .
His message was signed ' moot ' , a code name he uses on 4 chan for reasons no one has yet fathomed .
' My personal private life is very separate from my internet life , ' he told Time .
' There 's a firewall in between . '
Poole set up 4 chan because he wanted to share his passion for Japanese comics and TV rather than as a moneyspinner , which is just as well .
Although the site is popular , its scurrilous reputation makes it difficult to sell advertising space .

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
No . 031454
ALBERTO R. GONZALES , ATTORNEY GENERAL , et al. , PETITIONERS v. ANGEL McCLARY RAICH et al .
ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF
APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT
[ June 6 , 2005 ]
Justice Thomas , dissenting .
Respondents Diane Monson and Angel Raich use marijuana that has never been bought or sold , that has never crossed state lines , and that has had no demonstrable effect on the national market for marijuana .
If Congress can regulate this under the Commerce Clause , then it can regulate virtually anything and the Federal Government is no longer one of limited and enumerated powers .
I
Respondents  local cultivation and consumption of marijuana is not  Commerce among the several States . 
U.S. Const. , Art. I , §8 , cl.
3 . By holding that Congress may regulate activity that is neither interstate nor commerce under the Interstate Commerce Clause , the Court abandons any attempt to enforce the Constitutions limits on federal power .
The majority supports this conclusion by invoking , without explanation , the Necessary and Proper Clause .
Regulating respondents  conduct , however , is not necessary and proper for carrying into Execution  Congress restrictions on the interstate drug trade .
Art. I , §8 , cl. 18 .
Thus , neither the Commerce Clause nor the Necessary and Proper Clause grants Congress the power to regulate respondents  conduct .
A
As I explained at length in United States v. Lopez , 514 U.S. 549 ( 1995 ) , the Commerce Clause empowers Congress to regulate the buying and selling of goods and services trafficked across state lines .
Id. , at 586589 ( concurring opinion ) .
The Clauses text , structure , and history all indicate that , at the time of the founding , the term  commerce  consisted of selling , buying , and bartering , as well as transporting for these purposes .
Id. , at 585 ( Thomas , J. , concurring ) .
Commerce , or trade , stood in contrast to productive activities like manufacturing and agriculture .
Id. , at 586587 ( Thomas , J. , concurring ) .
Throughout founding - era dictionaries , Madisons notes from the Constitutional Convention , The Federalist Papers , and the ratification debates , the term commerce is consistently used to mean trade or exchange not all economic or gainful activity that has some attenuated connection to trade or exchange .
Ibid . ( Thomas , J. , concurring ) ; Barnett , The Original Meaning of the Commerce Clause , 68 U. Chi. L. Rev. 101 , 112125 ( 2001 ) .
The term commerce commonly meant trade or exchange ( and shipping for these purposes ) not simply to those involved in the drafting and ratification processes , but also to the general public .
Barnett , New Evidence of the Original Meaning of the Commerce Clause , 55 Ark. L. Rev. 847 , 857862 ( 2003 ) .
Even the majority does not argue that respondents  conduct is itself  Commerce among the several States . 
Art. I , §8 , cl.
3 . Ante , at 19 .
Monson and Raich neither buy nor sell the marijuana that they consume .
They cultivate their cannabis entirely in the State of California it never crosses state lines , much less as part of a commercial transaction .
Certainly no evidence from the founding suggests that commerce included the mere possession of a good or some purely personal activity that did not involve trade or exchange for value .
In the early days of the Republic , it would have been unthinkable that Congress could prohibit the local cultivation , possession , and consumption of marijuana .
On this traditional understanding of commerce ,  the Controlled Substances Act ( CSA ) , 21 U.S.C. § 801 et seq. , regulates a great deal of marijuana trafficking that is interstate and commercial in character .
The CSA does not , however , criminalize only the interstate buying and selling of marijuana .
Instead , it bans the entire market intrastate or interstate , noncommercial or commercial for marijuana .
Respondents are correct that the CSA exceeds Congress commerce power as applied to their conduct , which is purely intrastate and noncommercial .
B
More difficult , however , is whether the CSA is a valid exercise of Congress power to enact laws that are necessary and proper for carrying into Execution its power to regulate interstate commerce .
Art. I , §8 , cl. 18 .
The Necessary and Proper Clause is not a warrant to Congress to enact any law that bears some conceivable connection to the exercise of an enumerated power .
1
Nor is it , however , a command to Congress to enact only laws that are absolutely indispensable to the exercise of an enumerated power .
2
In McCulloch v. Maryland , 4 Wheat . 316 ( 1819 ) , this Court , speaking through Chief Justice Marshall , set forth a test for determining when an Act of Congress is permissible under the Necessary and Proper Clause :
 Let the end be legitimate , let it be within the scope of the constitution , and all means which are appropriate , which are plainly adapted to that end , which are not prohibited , but consist with the letter and spirit of the constitution , are constitutional .
Id. , at 421 .
To act under the Necessary and Proper Clause , then , Congress must select a means that is appropriate and plainly adapted to executing an enumerated power ; the means cannot be otherwise prohibited  by the Constitution ; and the means cannot be inconsistent with  the letter and spirit of the [ C] onstitution . 
Ibid. ; D. Currie , The Constitution in the Supreme Court : The First Hundred Years 1789  1888 , pp. 163164 ( 1985 ) .
The CSA , as applied to respondents  conduct , is not a valid exercise of Congress power under the Necessary and Proper Clause .
1
Congress has exercised its power over interstate commerce to criminalize trafficking in marijuana across state lines .
The Government contends that banning Monson and Raichs intrastate drug activity is necessary and proper for carrying into Execution its regulation of interstate drug trafficking .
Art. I , §8 , cl. 18 . See 21 U.S.C. § 801( 6 ) .
However , in order to be necessary ,  the intrastate ban must be more than a reasonable means [ of ] effectuat[ing ] the regulation of interstate commerce .
Brief for Petitioners 14 ; see ante , at 19 ( majority opinion ) ( employing rational - basis review ) .
It must be plainly adapted to regulating interstate marijuana trafficking in other words , there must be an obvious , simple , and direct relation between the intrastate ban and the regulation of interstate commerce .
Sabri v. United States , 541 U.S. 600 , 613 ( 2004 ) ( Thomas , J. , concurring in judgment ) ; see also United States v. Dewitt , 9 Wall . 41 , 44 ( 1870 ) ( finding ban on intrastate sale of lighting oils not appropriate and plainly adapted means for carrying into execution 
Congress taxing power ) .
On its face , a ban on the intrastate cultivation , possession and distribution of marijuana may be plainly adapted to stopping the interstate flow of marijuana .
Unregulated local growers and users could swell both the supply and the demand sides of the interstate marijuana market , making the market more difficult to regulate .
Ante , at 910 , 19 ( majority opinion ) .
But respondents do not challenge the CSA on its face .
Instead , they challenge it as applied to their conduct .
The question is thus whether the intrastate ban is necessary and proper as applied to medical marijuana users like respondents .
3
Respondents are not regulable simply because they belong to a large class ( local growers and users of marijuana ) that Congress might need to reach , if they also belong to a distinct and separable subclass ( local growers and users of state - authorized , medical marijuana ) that does not undermine the CSAs interstate ban .
Ante , at 67 ( OConnor , J. , dissenting ) .
The Court of Appeals found that respondents  limited use is distinct from the broader illicit drug market ,  because  th [ eir ] medicinal marijuana is not intended for , nor does it enter , the stream of commerce . 
Raich v. Ashcroft , 352 F.3d 1222 , 1228 ( CA9 2003 ) .
If that is generally true of individuals who grow and use marijuana for medical purposes under state law , then even assuming Congress has obvious  and plain reasons why regulating intrastate cultivation and possession is necessary to regulating the interstate drug trade , none of those reasons applies to medical marijuana patients like Monson and Raich .
Californias Compassionate Use
Act sets respondents  conduct apart from other intrastate producers and users of marijuana .
The Act channels marijuana use to seriously ill Californians ,  Cal . Health & Safety Code Ann . § 11362.5( b ) ( 1 ) ( A ) ( West Supp. 2005 ) , and prohibits  the diversion of marijuana for nonmedical purposes ,  § 11362.5 ( b ) ( 2 ) .4 California strictly controls the cultivation and possession of marijuana for medical purposes .
To be eligible for its program , California requires that a patient have an illness that cannabis can relieve , such as cancer , AIDS , or arthritis , § 11362.5 ( b ) ( 1 ) ( A ) , and that he obtain a physicians recommendation or approval , § 11362.5 ( d ) .
Qualified patients must provide personal and medical information to obtain medical identification cards , and there is a statewide registry of cardholders .
§§11362.715.76 .
Moreover , the Medical Board of California has issued guidelines for physicians  cannabis recommendations , and it sanctions physicians who do not comply with the guidelines .
See , e.g. , People v. Spark , 121 Cal. App. 4th 259 , 263 , 16 Cal. Rptr. 3d 840 , 843 ( 2004 ) .
This class of intrastate users is therefore distinguishable from others .
We normally presume that States enforce their own laws , Riley v. National Federation of Blind of N. C. , Inc. , 487 U.S. 781 , 795 ( 1988 ) , and there is no reason to depart from that presumption here : Nothing suggests that Californias controls are ineffective .
The scant evidence that exists suggests that few people the vast majority of whom are aged 40 or older register to use medical marijuana .
General Accounting Office , Marijuana : Early Experiences with Four States  Laws That Allow Use for Medical Purposes 2223 ( Rep. No. 03189 , Nov. 2002 ) , http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d01389.pdf
( all Internet materials as visited on June 3 , 2005 , and available in Clerk of Courts case file ) .
In part because of the low incidence of medical marijuana use , many law enforcement officials report that the introduction of medical marijuana laws has not affected their law enforcement efforts .
Id. , at 32 .
These controls belie the Governments assertion that placing medical marijuana outside the CSAs reach would prevent effective enforcement of the interstate ban on drug trafficking .
Brief for Petitioners 33 .
Enforcement of the CSA can continue as it did prior to the Compassionate Use Act .
Only now , a qualified patient could avoid arrest or prosecution by presenting his identification card to law enforcement officers .
In the event that a qualified patient is arrested for possession or his cannabis is seized , he could seek to prove as an affirmative defense that , in conformity with state law , he possessed or cultivated small quantities of marijuana intrastate solely for personal medical use .
People v. Mower , 28 Cal. 4th 457 , 469470 , 49 P.3d 1067 , 1073 1075 ( 2002 ) ; People v. Trippet , 56 Cal. App. 4th 1532 , 1549 ( 1997 ) .
Moreover , under the CSA , certain drugs that present a high risk of abuse and addiction but that nevertheless have an accepted medical usedrugs like morphine and amphetamines are available by prescription .
21 U.S.C. § 812 ( b ) ( 2 ) ( A ) ( B ) ; 21 CFR § 1308.12 ( 2004 ) .
No one argues that permitting use of these drugs under medical supervision has undermined the CSAs restrictions .
But even assuming that States controls allow some seepage of medical marijuana into the illicit drug market , there is a multibillion - dollar interstate market for marijuana .
Executive Office of the President , Office of Nat. Drug Control Policy , Marijuana Fact Sheet 5 ( Feb. 2004 ) , http://www.whitehousedrugpolicy.gov/publications/factsht/mariju ana/index.html .
It is difficult to see how this vast market could be affected by diverted medical cannabis , let alone in a way that makes regulating intrastate medical marijuana obviously essential to controlling the interstate drug market .
To be sure , Congress declared that state policy would disrupt federal law enforcement .
It believed the across - the - board ban essential to policing interstate drug trafficking .
21 U.S.C. § 801( 6 ) .
But as Justice OConnor points out , Congress presented no evidence in support of its conclusions , which are not so much findings of fact as assertions of power .
Ante , at 13 14 ( dissenting opinion ) .
Congress cannot define the scope of its own power merely by declaring the necessity of its enactments .
In sum , neither in enacting the CSA nor in defending its application to respondents has the Government offered any obvious reason why banning medical marijuana use is necessary to stem the tide of interstate drug trafficking .
Congress goal of curtailing the interstate drug trade would not plainly be thwarted if it could not apply the CSA to patients like Monson and Raich .
That is , unless Congress  aim is really to exercise police power of the sort reserved to the States in order to eliminate even the intrastate possession and use of marijuana .
2
Even assuming the CSAs ban on locally cultivated and consumed marijuana is necessary ,  that does not mean it is also proper . 
The means selected by Congress to regulate interstate commerce cannot be prohibited  by , or inconsistent with the letter and spirit of , the Constitution .
McCulloch , 4 Wheat . , at 421 .
In Lopez , I argued that allowing Congress to regulate intrastate , noncommercial activity under the Commerce Clause would confer on Congress a general police power over the Nation .
514 U.S. , at 584 , 600 ( concurring opinion ) .
This is no less the case if Congress ties its power to the Necessary and Proper Clause rather than the Commerce Clause .
When agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration raided Monsons home , they seized six cannabis plants .
If the Federal Government can regulate growing a half - dozen cannabis plants for personal consumption ( not because it is interstate commerce , but because it is inextricably bound up with interstate commerce ) , then Congress  Article I powersas expanded by the Necessary and Proper Clause have no meaningful limits .
Whether Congress aims at the possession of drugs , guns , or any number of other items , it may continue to  appropria[te ] state police powers under the guise of regulating commerce .
United States v. Morrison , 529 U.S. 598 , 627 ( 2000 ) ( Thomas , J. , concurring ) .
Even if Congress may regulate purely intrastate activity when essential to exercising some enumerated power , see Dewitt , 9 Wall . , at 44 ; but see Barnett , The Original Meaning of the Necessary and Proper Clause , 6 U. Pa. J. Const. L. 183 , 186 ( 2003 ) ( detailing statements by Founders that the Necessary and Proper Clause was not intended to expand the scope of Congress enumerated powers ) , Congress may not use its incidental authority to subvert basic principles of federalism and dual sovereignty .
Printz v. United States , 521 U.S. 898 , 923924 ( 1997 ) ; Alden v. Maine , 527 U.S. 706 , 732733 ( 1999 ) ; Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority , 469 U.S. 528 , 585 ( 1985 ) ( OConnor , J. , dissenting ) ; The Federalist No. 33 , pp. 204205 ( J. Cooke ed. 1961 ) ( A. Hamilton ) ( hereinafter The Federalist ) .
Here , Congress has encroached on States traditional police powers to define the criminal law and to protect the health , safety , and welfare of their citizens .
5 Brecht v. Abrahamson , 507 U.S. 619 , 635 ( 1993 ) ; Hillsborough County v. Automated Medical Laboratories , Inc. , 471 U.S. 707 , 719 ( 1985 ) .
Further , the Governments rationale that it may regulate the production or possession of any commodity for which there is an interstate market threatens to remove the remaining vestiges of States traditional police powers .
See Brief for Petitioners 21  22 ; cf. Ehrlich , The Increasing Federalization of Crime , 32 Ariz .
St. L. J. 825 , 826 , 841 ( 2000 ) ( describing both the relative recency of a large percentage of federal crimes and the lack of a relationship between some of these crimes and interstate commerce ) .
This would convert the Necessary and Proper Clause into precisely what Chief Justice Marshall did not envision , a pretext for the accomplishment of objects not intrusted to the government .
McCulloch , supra , at 423 .
II
The majority advances three reasons why the CSA is a legitimate exercise of Congress  authority under the Commerce Clause : First , respondents  conduct , taken in the aggregate , may substantially affect interstate commerce , ante , at 19 ; second , regulation of respondents  conduct is essential to regulating the interstate marijuana market , ante , at 21  22 ; and , third , regulation of respondents  conduct is incidental to regulating the interstate marijuana market , ante , at 1920 .
Justice OConnor explains why the majoritys reasons cannot be reconciled with our recent Commerce Clause jurisprudence .
The majoritys justifications , however , suffer from even more fundamental flaws .
A
The majority holds that Congress may regulate intrastate cultivation and possession of medical marijuana under the Commerce Clause , because such conduct arguably has a substantial effect on interstate commerce .
The majoritys decision is further proof that the substantial effects  test is a rootless and malleable standard  at odds with the constitutional design .
Morrison , supra , at 627 ( Thomas , J. , concurring ) .
The majoritys treatment of the substantial effects test is rootless , because it is not tethered to either the Commerce Clause or the Necessary and Proper Clause .
Under the Commerce Clause , Congress may regulate interstate commerce , not activities that substantially affect interstate commerceany more than Congress may regulate activities that do not fall within , but that affect , the subjects of its other Article I powers .
Lopez , supra , at 589 ( Thomas , J. , concurring ) .
Whatever additional latitude the Necessary and Proper Clause affords , supra , at 910 , the question is whether Congress  legislation is essential to the regulation of interstate commerce itself not whether the legislation extends only to economic activities that substantially affect interstate commerce .
Supra , at 4 ; ante , at 5 ( Scalia , J. , concurring in judgment ) .
The majoritys treatment of the substantial effects test is malleable , because the majority expands the relevant conduct .
By defining the class at a high level of generality ( as the intrastate manufacture and possession of marijuana ) , the majority overlooks that individuals authorized by state law to manufacture and possess medical marijuana exert no demonstrable effect on the interstate drug market .
Supra , at 78 .
The majority ignores that whether a particular activity substantially affects interstate commerce and thus comes within Congress reach on the majoritys approach can turn on a number of objective factors , like state action or features of the regulated activity itself .
Ante , at 67 ( OConnor , J. , dissenting ) .
For instance , here , if California and other States are effectively regulating medical marijuana users , then these users have little effect on the interstate drug trade .
6
The substantial effects test is easily manipulated for another reason .
This Court has never held that Congress can regulate noneconomic activity that substantially affects interstate commerce .
Morrison , 529 U.S. , at 613 ( [ T ] hus far in our Nations history our cases have upheld Commerce Clause regulation of intrastate activity only where that activity is economic in nature ( emphasis added ) ) ; Lopez , supra , at 560 .
To evade even that modest restriction on federal power , the majority defines economic activity in the broadest possible terms as the   the production , distribution , and consumption of commodities . 
 7 Ante , at 23 ( quoting Websters Third New International Dictionary 720 ( 1966 ) ( hereinafter Websters 3d ) .
This carves out a vast swath of activities that are subject to federal regulation .
See ante , at 89 ( OConnor , J. , dissenting ) .
If the majority is to be taken seriously , the Federal Government may now regulate quilting bees , clothes drives , and potluck suppers throughout the 50 States .
This makes a mockery of Madisons assurance to the people of New York that the powers delegated to the Federal Government are few and defined ,  while those of the States are numerous and indefinite .
The Federalist No. 45 , at 313 ( J. Madison ) .
Moreover , even a Court interested more in the modern than the original understanding of the Constitution ought to resolve cases based on the meaning of words that are actually in the document .
Congress is authorized to regulate  Commerce ,  and respondents  conduct does not qualify under any definition of that term .
8
The majoritys opinion only illustrates the steady drift away from the text of the Commerce Clause .
There is an inexorable expansion from  commerce ,   ante , at 1 , to commercial and economic activity , ante , at 20 , and finally to all production , distribution , and consumption of goods or services for which there is an established interstate market ,  ante , at 23 .
Federal power expands , but never contracts , with each new locution .
The majority is not interpreting the Commerce Clause , but rewriting it .
The majoritys rewriting of the Commerce Clause seems to be rooted in the belief that , unless the Commerce Clause covers the entire web of human activity , Congress will be left powerless to regulate the national economy effectively .
Ante , at 15  16 ; Lopez , 514 U.S. , at 573574 ( Kennedy , J. , concurring ) .
The interconnectedness of economic activity is not a modern phenomenon unfamiliar to the Framers .
Id. , at 590593 ( Thomas , J. , concurring ) ; Letter from J. Madison to S. Roane ( Sept. 2 , 1819 ) , in 3 The Founders Constitution 259260 ( P. Kurland & R. Lerner eds. 1987 ) .
Moreover , the Framers understood what the majority does not appear to fully appreciate :
There is a danger to concentrating too much , as well as too little , power in the Federal Government .
This Court has carefully avoided stripping Congress of its ability to regulate interstate commerce , but it has casually allowed the Federal Government to strip States of their ability to regulate intrastate commerce not to mention a host of local activities , like mere drug possession , that are not commercial .
One searches the Courts opinion in vain for any hint of what aspect of American life is reserved to the States .
Yet this Court knows that  [t ] he Constitution created a Federal Government of limited powers . 
 New York v. United States , 505 U.S. 144 , 155 ( 1992 ) ( quoting Gregory v. Ashcroft , 501 U.S. 452 , 457 ( 1991 ) ) .
That is why todays decision will add no measure of stability to our Commerce Clause jurisprudence :
This Court is willing neither to enforce limits on federal power , nor to declare the Tenth Amendment a dead letter .
If stability is possible , it is only by discarding the stand - alone substantial effects test and revisiting our definition of  Commerce among the several States . 
Congress may regulate interstate commerce not things that affect it , even when summed together , unless truly necessary and proper to regulating interstate commerce .
B
The majority also inconsistently contends that regulating respondents  conduct is both incidental and essential to a comprehensive legislative scheme .
Ante , at 19 20 , 2122 .
I have already explained why the CSAs ban on local activity is not essential .
Supra , at 78 .
However , the majority further claims that , because the CSA covers a great deal of interstate commerce , it is of no moment  if it also ensnares some purely intrastate activity .
Ante , at 19 .
So long as Congress casts its net broadly over an interstate market , according to the majority , it is free to regulate interstate and intrastate activity alike .
This cannot be justified under either the Commerce Clause or the Necessary and Proper Clause .
If the activity is purely intrastate , then it may not be regulated under the Commerce Clause .
And if the regulation of the intrastate activity is purely incidental , then it may not be regulated under the Necessary and Proper Clause .
Nevertheless , the majority terms this the pivotal distinction between the present case and Lopez and Morrison .
Ante , at 20 .
In Lopez and Morrison , the parties asserted facial challenges , claiming  that a particular statute or provision fell outside Congress commerce power in its entirety .
Ante , at 20 .
Here , by contrast , respondents claim only that the CSA falls outside Congress commerce power as applied to their individual conduct .
According to the majority , while courts may set aside whole statutes or provisions , they may not excise individual applications of a concededly valid statutory scheme .
Ante , at 20  21 ; see also Perez v. United States , 402 U.S. 146 , 154 ( 1971 ) ; Maryland v. Wirtz , 392 U.S. 183 , 192193 ( 1968 ) .
It is true that if respondents  conduct is part of a class of activities and that class is within the reach of federal power ,  Perez , supra , at 154 ( emphases deleted ) , then respondents may not point to the de minimis effect of their own personal conduct on the interstate drug market , Wirtz , supra , at 196 , n. 27 .
Ante , at 6 ( OConnor , J. , dissenting ) .
But that begs the question at issue : whether respondents  class of activities  is within the reach of federal power ,  which depends in turn on whether the class is defined at a low or a high level of generality .
Supra , at 5 .
If medical marijuana patients like Monson and Raich largely stand outside the interstate drug market , then courts must excise them from the CSAs coverage .
Congress expressly provided that if  a provision [ of the CSA ] is held invalid in one of more of its applications , the provision shall remain in effect in all its valid applications that are severable .
21 U.S.C. § 901 ( emphasis added ) ; see also United States v. Booker , 543 U.S. ___ , ___ ( 2005 ) ( slip op . , at 9 , and n . 9 ) ( Thomas , J. , dissenting in part ) .
Even in the absence of an express severability provision , it is implausible that this Court could set aside entire portions of the United States Code as outside Congress  power in Lopez and Morrison , but it cannot engage in the more restrained practice of invalidating particular applications of the CSA that are beyond Congress power .
This Court has regularly entertained as - applied challenges under constitutional provisions , see United States v. Raines , 362 U.S. 17 , 2021 ( 1960 ) , including the Commerce Clause , see Katzenbach v. McClung , 379 U.S. 294 , 295 ( 1964 ) ; Heart of Atlanta Motel , Inc. v. United States , 379 U.S. 241 , 249 ( 1964 ) ; Wickard v. Filburn , 317 U.S. 111 , 113114 ( 1942 ) .
There is no reason why , when Congress exceeds the scope of its commerce power , courts may not invalidate Congress  overreaching on a case - by - case basis .
The CSA undoubtedly regulates a great deal of interstate commerce , but that is no license to regulate conduct that is neither interstate nor commercial , however minor or incidental .
If the majority is correct that Lopez and Morrison are distinct because they were facial challenges to  particular statute [s ] or provision [s ] ,  ante , at 20 , then congressional power turns on the manner in which Congress packages legislation .
Under the majoritys reasoning , Congress could not enacteither as a single - subject statute or as a separate provision in the CSA a prohibition on the intrastate possession or cultivation of marijuana .
Nor could it enact an intrastate ban simply to supplement existing drug regulations .
However , that same prohibition is perfectly constitutional when integrated into a piece of legislation that reaches other regulable conduct .
Lopez , 514 U.S. , at 600601 ( Thomas , J. , concurring ) .
Finally , the majoritys view that because some of the CSAs applications are constitutional , they must all be constitutional undermines its reliance on the substantial effects test .
The intrastate conduct swept within a general regulatory scheme may or may not have a substantial effect on the relevant interstate market .
 [ O ] ne always can draw the circle broadly enough to cover an activity that , when taken in isolation , would not have substantial effects on commerce .
Id. , at 600 ( Thomas , J. , concurring ) .
The breadth of legislation that Congress enacts says nothing about whether the intrastate activity substantially affects interstate commerce , let alone whether it is necessary to the scheme .
Because medical marijuana users in California and elsewhere are not placing substantial amounts of cannabis into the stream of interstate commerce , Congress may not regulate them under the substantial effects test , no matter how broadly it drafts the CSA .
* * *
The majority prevents States like California from devising drug policies that they have concluded provide much - needed respite to the seriously ill .
It does so without any serious inquiry into the necessity for federal regulation or the propriety of  displac[ing ] state regulation in areas of traditional state concern ,  id. , at 583 ( Kennedy , J. , concurring ) .
The majoritys rush to embrace federal power is especially unfortunate given the importance of showing respect for the sovereign States that comprise our Federal Union . 
United States v. Oakland Cannabis Buyers  Cooperative , 532 U.S. 483 , 502 ( 2001 ) ( Stevens , J. , concurring in judgment ) .
Our federalist system , properly understood , allows California and a growing number of other States to decide for themselves how to safeguard the health and welfare of their citizens .
I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals .
I respectfully dissent .
Notes
It ’s hard to believe , but Digg ‘s latest feature , the recommendation engine , is one that has been in the works for over two years .
Before they developed images functionality , launched visualization tools , released Google , Netvibes , and Myspace widgets , developed Facebook functionality , rolled out dataportability enhancements , released updates to the comment system , updates to digg the candidates , and added several other features or enhancements to the social news site , the team at Digg already had the idea for a recommendation engine .
They were looking at the site as a platform that monitors how you interact with it , and improves your experience based on what it learns about you .
In fact , they took so long that some people even took matters into their own hands .
“ Digg is also learning a lot about what its users are into , ” Rose said , “ so it should be able to recommend stories based on what you ’ve been digging and allow you to communicate with other people who have similar interests . ”
– BusinessWeek , March 27 , 2006
It should come as no surprise that when Digg finally released the new feature , over 2 years later , the expectations were incredibly high .
After all , sites like StumbleUpon and Reddit have had similar recommendation engines for quite a while now and are already innovating beyond that .
My initial opinion of the recommendation engine is that it ’s decent but with some very obvious limitations .
While we should all be glad the feature has been released , it ’s very much a version 0.5 beta release .
Keep that in mind as you use it because the engine ’s performance can vary quite a bit from day to day .
How Does it Work ?
A lot of people have been speculating as to how the recommendation engine actually works .
To answer that in more detail , you should read Digg lead scientist Anton ’s Whitepaper on the subject or my exclusive guide and review .
Here ’s a brief overview .
Digg Recommendation Engine from Kevin Rose on Vimeo
Anton Talks About The Digg Recommendation Engine from Kevin Rose on Vimeo
Whenever you Digg a story , the recommendation engine records two things about the action .
First , that you liked that story , and second , every user that Dugg the story before you ( this includes the submitter ) .
This signals to the recommendation engine that these users like the same content as you , and sometimes they find it before you , so it uses those parameters to recommend to you stories they Digg or submit .
The recommendation engine also records your history over the last 30 days to correlate your Digging habits with other users who Digg the same stories as you .
The compatibility percentage tells you how much your Diggs match with this user , and based on the percentage , if you ’re not already friends , you can add and follow each other .
How it Does n’t Work
In theory , the system mentioned above can work fairly well .
Under the right conditions of healthy diversity of opinion , independence between individual members , and decentralization in the community , this recommendation algorithm would work great .
Does n’t sound like the Digg community , does it ?
The Digg community is a very homogeneous and imitative community , and for a community like that the rules the recommendation engine uses have one severe impact : they ensure that a core power group of users is much more visible to the community than the average person and that their content gets promoted over many other users .
This is n’t necessarily a bad thing , but it certainly can be a bad thing .
First , why it may not be a bad thing .
What happens with the recommendation engine is that users who have been participating on the site for a long time ( and because of their dedication to the community and the passion with which they participate , they ’ve developed a large following on the site ) get a lot more influential .
For example , if I ’m a popular user on the site and have a following of 100 people , with the recommendation engine , every time one of those hundred Diggs one of my stories , not only does that ensure that my stories are recommended more often to that user ( increasing our Digg correlation coefficient ) , but the same goes for every user that follows that user ( my followers ’ followers ) .
By the end of it , someone with a following of 100 now has a following of 150 , and not only is the following growing in absolute numbers but it also grows in diversity each time ( because the correlation is never 100 % ) .
This may not necessarily be a bad thing since these users are popular because they submit good content , and now more good content will be submited and promoted to the front page .
At the same time , this can be bad for the Digg community over time because if the same users get promoted over and over again , it creates an even more homogenized community and you will see similar memes from similar sites , on similar topics , pop up again and again .
This makes
Digg a community where people go not to learn or to discover , but to reaffirm their beliefs regardless of right or wrong .
The problem with it is n’t that it does n’t fulfill its promise of recommending content relevant to you .
The problem is that it recommends relevant content on a basis that is n’t as efficient or equitable as it should be and may not necessarily help Digg get its edge back ( for that we might need to look towards a freshness algorithm ) .
Apart from recommending stories based on who you Digg and who they Digg , the stories need to take into account what you Digg and where you Digg from ( content , categories , hopefully tags , and sources — we need to get contextual ) .
The recommendation engine was supposed to help you discover hidden gems , not show you stories from friends you usually Digg .
Those are stories you would come across anyway .
The methodology of the recommendation engine algorithm is also counterproductive to Digg ’s agenda of emasculating this core userbase .
Also Read :
Furthermore , the other limitation of the system , and this one is intentional and by design , is that the “ Diggers Like You ” section does n’t allow you to expand the list to more people .
The system , while matching you with other users , automatically decides on a cutoff point for the correlation , and shows you only people who make the cut .
I would like to meet a Digger that has an only 25 % overlap with me .
Maybe there are other stories I might like but am not seeing .
Finally , from a design perspective , people should be able to set what upcoming queue opens for them by default and how many stories are listed in their ‘ Recommendations in Upcoming ’ widget .
The Unexpected Consequences
The recommendation engine has many unexpected and unanticipated effects on everyone participating in the process , those creating the content , those submitting it , and those reading it .
Partly because of the hype around the new feature , partly because of the shiny red beta tag that people see in their profiles , and partly because the feature works better than any other feature on Digg for finding stories you would like , the feature has caused a big spike in activity on Digg .
Core users are submitting a much higher volume and voting on an equally higher number of stories .
At the same time , Digg is not throttling how many stories can be promoted to the front page on a day , so this increased activity means many more stories are being promoted .
I have also seen many instances of stories being promoted in 6 hours or less ( when they get recommended to a lot of people and get a burst of instant Diggs ) , and I have seen some stories get removed from the upcoming queue but still get promoted much after the 24 - hour mark .
There have also been stories with an astronomical number of Diggs that never got promoted .
Also , because so many more stories are being promoted , it means that each story gets even less time on the front page than before , hence , less number of Diggs per story , less comments per story , less outbound traffic per story , and for those interested , this also dampens the linkbuilding effect that Digg is known for having .
How to Make the Most of it
Making the most of the recommendation engine is very easy .
All you have to do is submit content you like and vote on content you like .
The system will do the rest .
The best part is the more you use it , the better it becomes for stories that are recommended to you , and who your stories are recommended to .
What it Means for Digg and for Advertisers
To truly understand the impact of the Digg recommendation engine you have to compare it to Facebook ’s much - maligned Beacon project .
The recommendation engine is something that , over time , will record exactly how you interact with Digg ’s platform , and know what stories / sources / links you like , what top - level categories and topics you like , and if they are smart , exactly what content you ’re consuming ( e.g. , contextually determining what music you like , what movies you ’re anticipating , and what new Apple products are on your wishlist ) .
The beta only records some very basic information ( that ’s why it ’s a beta ) , but it is expected to become much more complex and robust as time goes on .
This means better recommendations for you , but it also means that since Digg has a more comprehensive picture of who you really are , they can sell advertising that is better for you and for the advertiser , and for Digg ’s pocketbook .
What This Means for the Future
The future of the recommendation system is n’t much different than what Facebook plans on accomplishing with Beacon .
Beacon has a head start and already records offsite activities such as “ … purchasing a product , signing up for a service , adding an item to a wish list , and more . ”
Digg ’s ultimate goal is to be the decision market for all sorts of media ( text content , music , video , podcasts ) but also food / bars / clubs , shopping and entertainment , and more , and the recommendation engine is one more step toward that goal .
Note : According to Kevin Rose ’s TWiT appearance last week , activity is up as much as 40 % on some areas on the site .

Inspired by an article by Andrew Chen about using Google Insights to look at adoption of some web apps , I decided to put together a similar comparison looking at the global popularity of programming languages .
The languages I chose to look at were ( in alphabetical order ) : Common Lisp , Erlang , Groovy , Haskell , Java , Objective C , OCaml , Perl , Python , Ruby , Scala , and Scheme .
I performed the searches using Google Insights , and restricted them using the programming filter .
Let 's look at some pictures .

Some ending thoughts
In the end , these charts do n't provide much in the way of macro- insight .
I 'm not surprised that Ruby is most popular in Japan ( although the fact that it is nearly as popular in Belarus is unexpected ) , nor am I surprised that Russia is so strongly represented .
Instead , perhaps these charts provide some evidence for already held beliefs .
Did you think that much of Java programming is being farmed out to India ?
Well , that seems likely since India has the highest search density for Java ( and many of the other languages in the top ten searchers for Java are nations with a low per capita income ) .
But it also provides some interesting tidbits .
Would you have thought that India also has the highest search density for Objective C ?
Or that Jamaica has five times the search density of the United States for Haskell ?
Or that the highest that the United States ranks is the 5th position , and for Perl ?
Is there anything particularly interesting that you see in the charts ?
We have been told endlessly that the U.S. Civil War was a good war , fought to free the slaves .
About 110,100 Union soldiers were killed in action , and another 224,580 died from war - related diseases .
An estimated 275,175 Union soldiers were wounded .
In 1879 , it was believed that the Union had spent $ 6.1 billion on the war  and that was real money back then .
Yet to a significant degree , as far as the former black slaves were concerned , the South was triumphant .
We have here one of the most astonishing reminders about how wars backfire , which we ought to keep in mind when discussing other wars , particularly preemptive wars like the one in Iraq or the one being contemplated in Iran .
Not long after Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee surrendered at Appomattox , Abraham Lincoln ’s hand - picked successor , Andrew Johnson , helped ex-Confederates reestablish white supremacy in the Southern states .
These ex-Confederates understood that the war was n’t really over in 1865 .
They enacted Black Codes to restrict the freedom of blacks and restore slavery in everything but name .
To be sure , Radical Republicans in Congress asserted themselves and passed the Civil War Amendments , officially abolishing slavery , assuring equal rights for former slaves , and guaranteeing the right to vote .
But these amendments soon became dead letters .
Embittered ex-Confederates formed the Ku Klux Klan , the Knights of the White Camellia , and other terrorist organizations that conducted brutal " Negro hunts . "
The influence of Radical Republicans declined after a few years as their leaders died or became preoccupied with other issues .
Then the party of Lincoln made a deal to resolve the contested presidential election of 1876 : they would have federal troops withdrawn from the last three Southern states that were occupied after the Civil War , enabling Democrats to gain complete political control of the South , and in exchange Democrats would permit the Republican candidate , Rutherford B. Hayes , to become the 19th U.S. president .
The civil rights of blacks were subverted for almost another century .
Incredibly , in the name of reconciliation , Union veterans and Confederate veterans gathered at Memorial Day ceremonies to mourn the dead  without discussing any of the war issues .
Those were laid to rest .
In 1913 , Woodrow Wilson  the first Southerner elected president since the Civil War  gave a speech at Gettysburg , Pa. , marking the 50th anniversary of Lincoln ’s famous address there .
Despite all the wartime sacrifices , Wilson declared that the Civil War was " a quarrel forgotten . "
Moreover , Wilson betrayed his campaign assurances to the black community and segregated federal government offices that had n’t previously been segregated .
He defended segregation in a series of letters to New York Post editor Oswald Garrison Villard , the grandson of abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison .
Wilson claimed that segregation would eliminate " the discontent and uneasiness which had prevailed in many of the departments . "
Wilson added that segregation would make blacks " less likely to be discriminated against . "
The South was victorious ideologically .
Its view of the Civil War was the prevailing view in the North for a century .
Columbia University Professor William A. Dunning , a founder of the American Historical Association and its president in 1913 , was perhaps the most influential promoter of the Southern view .
He portrayed Radical Republicans as villains .
He helped popularize the term " Carpetbagger , " meaning Northerners who went South to seek public office after the Civil War .
Dunning defended segregation by claiming that blacks were incapable of self - government .
A star of the so - called " Dunning School " of post - Civil War historical writing was Ulrich Bonnell Phillips , who finished his teaching career at Yale .
He defended slaveholders against charges that they were brutal , and he claimed they did much to civilize the slaves .
Dunning School historians dominated American textbooks well into the 1950s and even the 1960s .
So , the Civil War was supposed to be quick and easy , and obviously it was n’t .
The Union ’s military victories gave the losers an uncontrollable lust for revenge , and they renewed their oppression of blacks at the earliest opportunity .
Nobody could be counted on to protect the blacks .
The Civil War was no shortcut to civil rights .
After the war , Northerners did n’t want to remember why they had fought , or at least the part about freeing the slaves .
We ought to know by now that the killing and destruction of wars tend to intensify hatreds , and they ’re bound to play out , often in hideous ways that can be impossible even for a militarily superior power to control .
If we had as much trouble as we did trying to achieve social reform through war in our own backyard , how can we expect to do wonderful things by sending our soldiers and money to faraway places we know comparatively little about ?
The history of emancipation in the Western Hemisphere made clear that war was n’t the only way or the best way to free the slaves .
Although slavery had been around for thousands of years , abolitionists launched epic movements generating political support that doomed slavery in only about a century and a quarter .
Slave rebellions reminded everybody that slaveholding was a risky business .
There were private and governmental efforts to buy the freedom of slaves , reducing the number of slaves , reducing the amount of slaveholding territory , and reducing the political clout of slaveholders .
Underground railroads further undermined slavery , and the runaways brought with them fresh horror stories for antislavery campaigns .
A peaceful , persistent campaign involving a combination of strategies was the key to abolishing slavery .
This was also the key to the campaign Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B .
Anthony launched to secure equal rights for women , the campaign that Mohandas Gandhi launched for Indian independence , and the campaign that Martin Luther King launched for civil rights in America .
Are You Acting Like a Spoiled Child ?
The Gatekeeper
Why is it so hard to see the truth about ourselves ?
Our desires and fears color everything we think and see .
We ’re not completely objective about anything .
But , it ’s easier to look at someone else ’s situation and see it more clearly , more truly .
Do you ever find yourself going in circles , unable to decide , unable to take action ?
You feel the urge to move in some positive direction , and at the same time , you feel compelled to stay where you are , or move in some trivial way that is no movement at all .
Sometimes , we ’re aware of being stuck , and it pains us .
Other times , we just dismiss it as no big deal .
Yet , when we look at others who are stuck like this , we ca n’t understand what ’s wrong with them .
We often say to others the equivalent of “ just do it . ”
Personal Development seems easy from the outside , looking in .
Maybe you know people who are addicts , or who have some compulsive behavior , or phobias .
And you , who do n’t suffer from their addiction or behavior , just ca n’t understand why they do what they do .
It seems like there ’s an invisible force that pushes them in the wrong direction , or a barrier that stops them from moving in the right direction .
Much of the time , outside advice is no more powerful than the voice in you that tells you to move .
And you remain stuck .
We could speak of the power of habits .
When we ’ve developed a habit , our mind works to maintain it and protect it .
We act in a certain way without thinking .
But that ’s not the whole story .
There are many habits that you can break with attention and persistence .
While other behaviors haunt you .
As though there were someone inside you that wo n’t let you pass through a gate that leads to another life .
It ’s as though there ’s a jailer , or gatekeeper who guards you , and wo n’t let you out .
The Enemy Within ?
This force within us that wo n’t let us move and change , seems like an enemy .
It sabotages our success , our growth , our relationships .
It keeps us stuck in a life that we want to transform .
We feel trapped , imprisoned .
Sometimes we feel as though we ’re stuck in someone else ’s life , while our true life is waiting for us beyond that invisible gate .
Will we ever pass through the gate to the life we ache for ?
As long as we think that the Gatekeeper is our enemy , the more he will block our path .
Surprisingly , the Gatekeeper is not your enemy .
He ’s here to protect you .
He ’s the parent , the one who says “ no . ”
The gatekeeper is the one who treats you like a child , and thinks that you can only be safe if he holds you by the hand .
Think back to your time as a child .
Most parents try to protect their children from real , or imagined dangers .
Parents tell us where to go and what to do , and they tell us to stop .
Is there any word more associated with parenting than No ?
Most of us move beyond taking orders from our parents at some point in our lives .
But we ’ve internalized the idea that protecting ourselves from danger means acting like a parent .
That means standing at the door and saying no .
Who Stands Watch Over Your Life and Keeps You Safe ?
We need a new way of looking at safety , and protecting ourselves .
We ca n’t just dismiss this part of ourselves that wants to keep us safe .
We have an innate , fundamental desire to be safe .
But we can replace our inner parent with a different kind of guardian .
We can appoint a trusted adviser , someone level - headed who will suggest which actions are more risky and less risky .
When you work with an adviser , you take responsibility for your own safety , and you accept that every action has risk .
And you are responsible to make the final decision .
Being a child often means not deciding for yourself .
It means letting someone else take responsibility for what happens .
Are we ready to stop being helpless children , who can always blame someone else for whatever goes wrong ?
Are you tired of acting like a spoiled child , who wants his own way , but wo n’t accept any responsibility ?
Are you ready to protect yourself ?
I ’m not suggesting that people with serious phobias or compulsive behavior can erase all their problems with a simple change in attitude .
But that change in attitude makes an extraordinary difference for everyone .
And for many of us , this change in attitude , changes everything .
The lack of availability of mortgages is still affecting the market UK house prices have seen an annual double - digit fall for the first time since 1990 , according to the latest survey from the Nationwide .
Prices were 10.5 % lower in August than they were a year ago .
Prices fell by 1.9 % compared with July .
The average home now costs £ 164,654 , which is more than £ 19,000 cheaper than the average price one year ago .
Gloomy forecasts from house builders mean the market is likely to remain subdued , Nationwide says .
The Nationwide survey found that house prices have fallen for 10 months in a row and are at their lowest level since early 2006 .
Fixed - rate favour Data from estate agents suggested " there may be some glimmers of interest returning to the market " as some buyers were taking the opportunity to secure large discounts , said Nationwide 's chief economist Fionnuala Earley .
The extent to which [ an interest rate fall ] will revive the mortgage and housing market is likely to be limited while overall confidence in economic and housing market conditions is low
Fionnuala Earley , Nationwide
Gloom over house price figures
But she said that an increased supply of properties on agents ' books would continue to act as a dampener to house price growth in the short term .
House builders were pointing to a loss of consumer confidence for the continued slowdown , the report said .
And Ms Earley added that the lack of availability of mortgages was still pushing down house purchase activity .
" There is clearly less mortgage borrowing taking place in the current market , but those borrowers choosing a new loan are tending to opt for fixed rate loans , even though they have been more expensive than trackers , " Ms Earley said .
First - time buyers Earlier this month , figures from the Council of Mortgage Lenders ( CML ) suggested that the slump in mortgage lending continued in July .
Total lending stood at £ 24.8 bn , up by 5 % from June , but still 27 % lower than a year ago .
First - time buyers , who would normally benefit from falling prices , have struggled to obtain cheap mortgage deals without a large deposit .
However , the cost of fixed - rate mortgages has been falling in recent weeks with a series of lenders cutting their interest rates .
Ms Earley said the " gloomier feel " of the economy in general , as well as rising food and fuel prices and a lack of confidence with jobs made people more prudent with their borrowing .
She said that prices , that were still higher than five years ago , were likely to keep falling this year as there remained a lot of uncertainty in the market .
She added that the situation would not turn around very rapidly unless there was a significant change in consumer sentiment .
Rate cuts
The door was open for interest rate cuts by the Bank of England , she added , but this in itself would not turn things around .

" We expect the next move in the bank rate to be down , but the extent to which this will revive the mortgage and housing market is likely to be limited while overall confidence in economic and housing market conditions is low , " she said .
The picture is not completely the same across the UK .
Although the Nationwide figures take an average from across the country , Ms Earley said the Scottish market was proving more resilient than most areas .
Northern Ireland , in contrast , was experiencing higher than average falls .
Henry Pryor , who runs property website primemove.com , said that markets were affected by local factors .

What are these ?
Sarkozy is back in the news .
And the debate is relevant here too .
Sarkozy recently announced the building of a second nuclear power station based on an EPW ( European Pressurised Water ) reactor .
Unfortunately , this was shortly followed by news of the leak of a small quantity of liquid containing traces of uranium at another power station in the south of France .
What is of interest is that neither the proposed reactor nor the accident was front page news .
In the case of the leak , the regulatory and local authorities took rapid action to reassure the public , placing the incident at " one " on a scale of risk that ran to seven .
Both stories were tucked away in middle pages .
Apart from a few of the usual suspects doing a ritual dance of protest , it was all dismissed with a collective gallic shrug .
The fact is that the French are comfortable with nuclear energy and have been for a long time .
The industry has an enviable record for safety and security , it provides the vast bulk of French electric power in a reliable and steady supply and relatively cheaply .
In the current context , it totally lacks a carbon footprint , and the price is not determined by OPEC or the oil speculators .
Landing in France recently , we passed a huge nuclear installation near Cherbourg , and drove past at least two others that we knew of en route to the south - west , where , a few kilometres down the road there is another on the banks of the Gironde at the historic city of Blaye .
There is , however , a marked scarcity of two - headed calves , deformed sheep , luminous fish or any other of the horrors imagined by anti-nuclear campaigners .
The children all look healthy and normal , and life expectancy for adults ( fortified by a diet of wine , cheese and oysters ) is marginally better than the rest of France .
Which brings me back to Ireland .
For how much longer can we refuse to discuss even the possibility of using nuclear energy as a source of electricity ?
At a time when fossil fuels are running out , with China and India ever demanding more , and prices of oil and gas going through the roof , we cannot remain dependant on this one source .
It will take a huge number of windmills , marine turbines and solar panels to make up the deficit ( and these too have their critics on grounds of environmental degradation ) .
Off - shore oil and gas reserves , even if the green lobby allows them to be brought ashore , only become economical because of the exorbitant price of everything else .
Apart from which , to be at the end of a thousand - mile long pipeline is hardly a recipe for energy security , with 10 or more political or entrepreneurial hands on successive stopcocks , leaving Ireland in a position of total dependency on the whims of the international market and speculators for supplies of oil and natural gas .
It is ironic , however , that despite our protestations of anti-nuclear purity , some proportion of the power which we import through electrical interconnectors from Britain and Europe is inevitably the product of nuclear reactors in one country or another .
This is another Irish solution to an Irish problem : quite happy to enjoy the fruits of sin while the sin itself , and the guilt of sinning are conveniently exported .
IRISH political debate on nuclear energy has been paralysed for decades by the spectre of the scandal of a criminally badly managed installation at Sellafield ( previously known as Windscale ) in Cumbria where leakage after leakage was left unreported through union power and the need to preserve employment in a distressed Labour constituency .
The disaster of the cataclysmic collapse of a clapped - out , Soviet - era reactor at Chernobyl has added its own ghastly resonance .
A study carried out for the Northern Ireland Department of Health in the 1980s could find no linkage between Sellafield and a high incidence of some cancers on the County Down coast .
In fact , there was more measurable radiation from the average granite gatepost in the Mourne Mountains .
The highest incidence of Down Syndrome in the North was in the west , the farthest area away from Cumbria .
Nuclear energy is now cleaner ; reactors are safer and better policed .
There is no reason for us to bury our heads in the sand , and , while maintaining even current demands for energy and electric power , perversely refuse to contemplate the use of one source that may in the end prove to be less environmentally damaging than most of the alternatives .
Nuclear power will never be the sole , or even the main source of energy in Ireland .
In the end it may not prove to be the best , but there are balances to be held between possible risk and potential gain as other sources dry up and options narrow .
It will , in any case , be some years down the road , but all the more reason to begin an honest and open debate .
This is a task for political leaders and they should begin now .
To assert categorically in advance that nuclear - generated power can play no part in a national energy strategy is to sacrifice the future to the emotions of the past .
They do , indeed , order these things better in France ...
DNC superdelegate : ' The election is over .
Everybody knows that . '
RAW STORY
Published : Friday May 9 , 2008

Print This Email This Obama picks up 6 superdelegates , union endorsement Barack Obama all but erased Hillary Rodham Clinton 's once - imposing lead among national convention superdelegates on Friday and won fresh labor backing as elements of the Democratic Party began coalescing around the Illinois senator for the fall campaign .
Obama picked up the backing of five superdelegates , including Rep. Donald Payne of New Jersey , a member of the Congressional Black Caucus who had been a Clinton supporter .
In addition to Payne , Rep. Peter DeFazio of Oregon and two members of the Democratic National Committee from California announced they were supporting Obama .
" The election is over , everybody knows that .
Obama has won , " said Vernon Watkins , one of the two .
Obama also snagged the support of John Gage , president of the American Federation of Government Employees .
The union claims about 600,000 members who work in the federal and Washington , D.C. , governments .
Another unexpected superdelegate vote came in this afternoon when New Mexico 's National Democratic Committeewoman Laurie Weahkee announced that she would line - up behind Barack Obama .
 After the primary elections in Indiana and North Carolina , it was absolutely clear that Barack Obama would be our nominee ,  Weahkee wrote in an email to the New Mexico Independent .
She added ,  Obama has proven that he can campaign in a difficult environment and still inspire thousands of new voices to take part in the democratic process .
Weahkee is the lead organizer for the Native American Voters Alliance .
Obama , who won a convincing victory in the North Carolina primary and lost Indiana narrowly on Tuesday , has been steadily gaining strength in the days since .
Clinton also gained a superdelegate .
The developments left the former first lady with 271.5 superdelegates , to 268 for Obama , according to AP .
Little more than four months ago , on the eve of the primary season , she held a lead of 169 - 63 .
ABC , however , has Obama now with the superdelegate lead , 267 to Clintons 265 .
" After careful consideration , I have reached the conclusion that Barack Obama can best bring about the change that our country so desperately wants and needs , " said Payne , who in a statement said that Clinton is a good friend and he still holds her in high regard .
Clinton 's new supporter was Rep. Chris Carney , D - Pa .
His congressional district voted overwhelmingly for the former first lady in the Pennsylvania primary on April 22 .
Both Obama and Clinton have courted superdelegates in recent days in private meetings at party headquarters not far from the Capitol .
Despite Watkins ' assessment , Clinton has shown no signs she is ready to quit the race .
She is heavily favored to win Tuesday 's primary in West Virginia , and is in the midst of a two - day swing through several other states with upcoming elections .

I ’ve started to read a number of commentators around editorial pages , blogs , and letters to the editor that are quoting an Australian by the name of David Evans .
In case you ’re unfamiliar , Evans wrote an op -ed in The Australian titled “ No smoking hot spot ” where he raises a number of issues with the science of global heating .
Evans used to work toward mitigating global heating but has since become a skeptic based on perceived weaknesses in the data and modeling of the effects of global heating .
Because of his background as a former global heating analyst for the Australian government , he ’s become something of a rock star in the denier movement , and his quoting of Lord Keynes ( “ When the facts change , I change my mind .
What do you do , sir ? ” ) in his op - ed has become almost a mantra for the global heating deniers and skeptics .
Unfortunately for Evans ’ global heating skepticism , but fortunately for the advancement of understanding of the Earth ’s climate and anthropogenic global heating , it appears that the facts have changed on him yet again .
Evans ’ first “ fact ” is that scientists have been looking for tropical warming in the troposphere for decades and have never detected it .
Since weather balloons ( radiosondes ) have n’t detected the hot spot , it must not be there .
As reported previously in the Carboholic , a new method of measuring temperature by proxy from the velocity of radiosondes in the atmosphere has been developed .
And the new proxy data is not only much less error prone ( the original temperature data that supposedly failed to find heating in the troposphere actually found no such thing – it had so many errors and systemic biases that the temperature measurements were all meaningless , something that Evans fails to mention – see the introduction to this paper for some examples of the errors ) , but the proxy data reveals that the troposphere a ) has warmed and b ) has warmed as the climate models have predicted .
Unfortunately , Evans engages in ad hominim against the scientists who have proposed this proxy measurement .
He should have read the actual papers ( the top three papers available here ) instead of blithely rejecting them with a suggestion that they ’re contaminated simply because the research was done by so - called “ alarmists ” .
Evans ’ second “ fact ” is that we have no evidence that carbon emissions are responsible for global heating .
There are a great many papers that contradict this assertion , starting with John Tyndall in 1861 and proceeding through Svante Arrhenius , G. S. Callendar , and others .
Most of the original science on the greenhouse effect and the impact of carbon dioxide ( CO 2 ) was done before the 1950s .
However , the actual facts of the matter are these – the greenhouse effect exists ( there is no debate about this whatsoever ) , CO 2 is responsible for between 9 and 26 % of the observed greenhouse effect , so a 30 % increase in CO 2 concentrations will increase the greenhouse effect by 3 - 8 % .
This simple estimate is made more accurate by using ice core data , from which climatologists have estimated the sensitivity of the climate to changes in CO 2 ( sensitivity is calculated using stable temperature periods , so which came first , the interglacial transition or the rise in CO 2 , does n’t matter ) at varying levels , but observations of how CO 2 absorbs radiation have given estimates that range from as low as 1 to as high as 14 degrees C per doubling of CO 2 concentration .
Most experts agree that the most likely range is from 2 to 4.5 degrees C per doubling of CO 2 concentration , with a mean value of about 3 degrees C per doubling .
Regardless , however , the actual fact remains that a massive body of evidence that CO 2 is having an impact on global climate exists , not “ none ” as Evans claims .
Evans ’ third “ fact ” is that we can only trust satellite temperature data , but since it only goes back to 1979 , we do n’t have a long enough span of data to make good conclusions .
What ’s remarkable is that Evans ’ claims that nearly 30 years of satellite data is n’t enough to estimate climate trends , yet he points out that the planet has supposedly cooled since 2001 .
If 30 years of data is n’t enough to make good trend estimates , a mere 7 years certainly is n’t long enough .
Not only that , but Evans also claims that the GISS uses only land data and that the other major global temperature sets ( MET and RSS / University of Alabama are two of them , perhaps all three ) use satellite only or satellite and lands measurements .
This is false – GISS uses land and ocean measurements , MET uses land and radiosonde and satellite , while RSS and UoA use the RSS - operated satellites exclusively .
That said , however , Evans ’ concern over the impact of urban heat island effects on land - based is valid .
But that ’s the only part of this section that is .
Evans ’ final “ fact ” is that ice cores show an 800 year difference between the start of a deglaciation ( transition from an ice age to an interglacial period ) and the rise in CO 2 .
While this is certainly true , Evans ’ statement that this “ says something important about which was cause and which was effect ” is fundamentally in error .
A 2003 paper by Caillon et al in the journal Science pointed out that the 800 year lag appeared to be step two in a three - step process : southern hemisphere heats up , southern oceans release a lot of CO 2 into the atmosphere , global heating driven by CO 2 melts the northern hemisphere .
I go into gory detail on this paper here .
Evans ’ facts are hardly factual , yet he has the audacity to claim that he changed his mind because the facts changed .
I ca n’t help but wonder if he ’ll change his mind again now that the false nature of his claims is so readily apparent .

The June 2008 issue of the journal Science published a “ News of the Week ” story about how the Earth ’s deserts appear to be carbon dioxide sinks , roughly on par with temperate forests for their capacity to sequester CO 2 .
What ’s unknown , however , is whether the measurements performed in the Mojave desert of California and the Gubantonggut desert in western China are anomalous or representative of all deserts .
If all deserts absorb CO 2 at the same rate as the two measured deserts do , and if the results of the two deserts are confirmed , then deserts could represent a previously unknown part of the carbon cycle .
However , the story makes it clear that deserts are n’t expected to fully account for the CO 2 missing from the carbon emission / absorption equations – the Earth is simply absorbing more than scientists can fully account for at the moment .
And some scientists are understandably skeptical about whether or not the desert CO 2 flux measurements ( the difference between CO 2 absorbed and emitted ) are even accurate .
There are too many unknowns yet to know what ’s happening for certain , such as what form the sequestered carbon it taking , where it ’s going , the annual carbon flux vs.
the nightly flux that was calculated , and so on .
Regardless , though , the data is interesting enough , and the potential impact great enough , that every scientist interviewed for the story , however skeptical of the methodology or data , recommended continuing and expanding research into how deserts influence the carbon cycle .

A couple of weeks ago , the Guardian newspaper online ran a story about how political cartoonists were addressing global heating .
The paper titled their story “ Cartoonists use humour to tackle climate change ” .
The problem with this title is that very few , if any , of the cartoons are funny in any classical sense .
In fact , most of them are morbidly serious , and a few I just did n’t get .
One of the many cartoons available for viewing from the Guardian is pictured at right .
The others are all worth viewing here .

There ’s a great deal of question whether or not hydrogen makes sense as a “ clean ” fuel .
It ’s difficult to store , difficult to transport , highly energy intensive to create in the first place , and dangerously reactive .
All those things make hydrogen an unlikely , but not impossible , replacement for natural gas and / or petroleum for use in homes or transportation .
Only a few die -hards at the National Renewable Energy Lab ( NREL ) in Golden , Colorado had suggested that hydrogen might be viable as energy storage for when renewable energy sources were n’t active , such as when the wind stopped blowing or the sun set .
Now , however , a new development out of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology may change all that , and all because Professor Daniel Nocera discovered an inexpensive , non-toxic , natural catalyst to boost the efficiency of electrolysis of water ( the splitting of water into gaseous hydrogen and oxygen ) .
According to the article , “ Nocera hopes that within 10 years , homeowners will be able to power their homes in daylight through photovoltaic cells , while using excess solar energy to produce hydrogen and oxygen to power their own household fuel cell . ”
While possible , this vision of a distributed energy future rests not on the ability to split water into its components , but rather on solving technical problems that are unrelated to hydrogen , namely the photovoltaic energy conversion efficiency problem and the safe hydrogen storage problem .
Current photovoltaic cells are inefficient , with the best cells converting about 40 % of the incident solar energy into useful electricity .
Most cells are much less efficient , especially when compared to the global average of 33 % for coal plants , and we do n’t really want to be using the most carbon - intensive fuel around to create otherwise clean hydrogen .
Storing hydrogen presently required great pressure and thus a high risk of explosion , extremely cold temperatures and a correspondingly high risk of freezing , or chemical storage , all of which are inefficient uses of energy .
And I do n’t know about you , but unless I ’m really confident that the explosion , cryogenic temperature , or toxic chemical risks are minimal to my children and pets , I would n’t want any of the above in my personal home .

It may well be inevitable that plug - in hybrids or fully electric cars replace today ’s petroleum - powered behemoths .
In many respects , the sooner this occurs , the better , since it ’s much easier to control the emissions of CO 2 from centralized power plants than it is from hundreds of millions of individual vehicles .
But there ’s a catch – electric utilities could n’t provide all the necessary electricity , and even if they could , the present electricity transmission wires are simply incapable of carrying the required electricity to charge all those batteries at the same time .
The electric or plug - in hybrid future requires a great deal of public investment in the electricity infrastructure , and that will take time .
But according to the Chicago Tribune article , some utilities are hoping that the electric car future arrive sooner rather than later .
The reason is that , when those batteries are all plugged in to the power grid , they serve as electricity storage for when the power company needs extra electricity to balance supply with demand ( something demanded by the laws of physics rather than the laws of man ) , reducing the costs to the utility , the cost to the owner of those electric vehicles , and the amount of carbon dioxide emitted into the atmosphere .
Of course , that requires that drivers charge up overnight and also plug their car into the grid during the day so that the utility can charge , or drain , their car battery as necessary .
And that requires charging stations for every parking lot in the country .
That ’s a lot of 240 volt outlets .
The next decade could be a great year to be a green electrician … .

When it comes to aerosols ( fine particles or droplets suspended in the air ) , climate models have historically modeled their effect on climate in a relatively simple manner – either the aerosol is a net absorber or a net reflector of radiation .
Scientists at Arizona State University have been directly measuring the optical properties of a large number of so - called “ brown aerosols ” ( aerosols that are usually pollution and are n’t soot or visually transparent ) and have discovered that the simple models of brown aerosols does n’t accurately represent their climate effects .
Apparently , the properties of the aerosols are such that whether they ’re absorbing or reflecting depends on where in the atmosphere they ’re located , and most of them are partially absorbing .
What this means for climate modelers is that they ’ll need to update their models to incorporate a more complicated system for estimating aerosol radiative forcing .
Without knowing the exact details of the various brown aerosols , however , the exact error in the estimates of aerosol forcing on the Earth ’s climate is still an unknown .

Here ’s what you need to do to get ipython running on maemo scratchbox ( Diablo , though also applicable for Chinook with slight modifications ) :
Ensure that you have the following in /etc/apt/sources.list :
deb http://repository.maemo.org/extras diablo free non-free
Run ‘ apt - get update ’ and ‘ apt - get upgrade ’ ( this is because the python2.5 shipped with Diablo comes without readline support ) , then install setuptools :
apt - get install python2.5-setuptools
Install ipython with easy_install :
python2.5 /usr/bin/easy_install ipython
HOWEVER , the maemo sdk’s have a buggy readline , so you should fix the cd completer if you are using a newer ipython than 0.8.4 .
In that case , you should add the following lines to your ipy_user_conf.py :
import ipy_completers
ipy_completers.greedy_cd_completer = True
And to always get the latest nightly snapshot of ipython , do :
wget http://ipython.scipy.org/dist/testing/ipython-dev-nightly.tgz
cd ipython - dev- nightly
python2.5 setup.py install

This certainly qualifies as an interesting development .
CBC is reporting that FACIL , a non-profit organization that promotes the adoption of free software in Quebec , is suing the provincial government for buying Microsoft software .
More specifically , they are alleging that Quebec 's provincial government refuses to allow competing bids ( including bids from free software vendors ) in preference of large players like Microsoft .
Allow me to quote from the CBC article .
" Quebec 's open - source software association is suing the provincial government , saying it is giving preferential treatment to Microsoft Corp. by buying the company 's products rather than using free alternatives .
The lawsuit by Facil was lodged with the Quebec Superior Court on July 15 and made public on Wednesday .
In it , the group says the provincial government has refused to entertain competing bids from all software providers , opting instead to supply public - sector departments with products bought from proprietary vendors such as Microsoft and Oracle Corp . "
You can read the entire article on the CBC Website .
You will also want to read FACIL 's press release on this suit .
What do you think ?
Is FACIL doing the right thing ?
I 've said many times that it 's very nearly a crime that our governments and schools cry poverty when they spend a veritable fortune on proprietary software and its trappings .
Is FACIL 's action what 's needed to force government to play nice with our tax dollars ?

Jukebox John keeps changing his tune
It ’s obvious that the McCain campaign and the RNC have decided to go after Barack Obama as a flip - flopper .
What ’s equally obvious , though , that Republicans could n’t have chosen a worse narrative .
McCain & Co. seemed to stumble on this line of attack almost by accident .
They ’d experimented with a variety of memes in recent months , none of which had any real salience .
The right settled on “ flip - flopper , ” in large part because it ’s the closest available , already - written Republican narrative , and in part because McCain staffers have n’t been able to think of anything else .
The irony , of course , is that the McCain campaign could n’t have picked a more hypocritical line of attack .
Below you ’ll find a comprehensive list of reversals from the Republican nominee , numbered and organized by category for easier reference .
Remember , McCain recently said , “ This election is about trust and trusting people ’s word . ”
Just a few days prior , the McCain campaign admonished Obama for trying to “ have it both ways ” on issues .
I should note that there ’s nothing offensive about a political figure changing his or her mind once in a while .
Policy makers come to one conclusion , they gain more information , and then they reach a different conclusion .
That is , to be sure , a good thing — it reflects a politician with an open mind and a healthy intellectual curiosity .
Better to have a leader who changes his or her mind based on new information than one who stubbornly sticks to outmoded policy positions , regardless of facts or circumstances .
So why do McCain ’s flip - flops matter ?
Because all available evidence suggests his reversals are n’t sincere , they ’re cynically calculated for political gain .
This is n’t indicative of an open mind ; it ’s actually indicative of a character flaw .
And given the premise of McCain ’s presidential campaign , it ’s an area in desperate need of scrutiny .
The perception people have of McCain is outdated , reflective of a man who no longer has any use for his previous persona .
What ’s wrong with a politician who changes his or her views ?
Nothing in particular , but when a politician changes his views so much that he has an entirely different worldview , is it unreasonable to wonder whether it ’s entirely sincere ?
Especially when there ’s no other apparent explanation for six dozen significant reversals ?
McCain has been in Congress for more than a quarter - century ; he ’s bound to shift now and then on various controversies .
But therein lies the point — McCain was consistent on most of these issues , right up until he started running for president , at which point he conveniently abandoned literally dozens of positions he used to hold .
The problem is n’t just the incessant flip - flops — though that ’s part of it — it ’s more about the shameless pandering and hollow convictions behind the incessant flip - flops .
That the media still perceives McCain as some kind of “ straight talker ” who refuses to sway with the political winds makes this all the more glaring .
Here ’s the list .
National Security Policy
1. McCain thought Bush ’s warrantless - wiretap program circumvented the law ; now he believes the opposite .
2. McCain insisted that everyone , even “ terrible killers , ” “ the worst kind of scum of humanity , ” and detainees at Guantanamo Bay , “ deserve to have some adjudication of their cases , ” even if that means “ releasing some of them . ”
McCain now believes the opposite .
3 . He opposed indefinite detention of terrorist suspects .
When the Supreme Court reached the same conclusion , he called it “ one of the worst decisions in the history of this country . ”
4 . In February 2008 , McCain reversed course on prohibiting waterboarding .
5. McCain was for closing the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay before he was against it .
6 . When Barack Obama talked about going after terrorists in Pakistani mountains with predators , McCain criticized him for it .
He ’s since come to the opposite conclusion .
Foreign Policy
7. McCain was for kicking Russia out of the G8 before he was against it .
Now , he ’s for it again .
8. McCain supported moving “ towards normalization of relations ” with Cuba .
Now he believes the opposite .

Now he believes the opposite .
11 . McCain is both for and against a “ rogue state rollback ” as a focus of his foreign policy vision .
12 . McCain used to champion the Law of the Sea convention , even volunteering to testify on the treaty ’s behalf before a Senate committee .
Now he opposes it .
13 . McCain was against divestment from South Africa before he was for it .
Military Policy
14 . McCain recently claimed that he was the “ greatest critic ” of Rumsfeld ’s failed Iraq policy .
In December 2003 , McCain praised the same strategy as “ a mission accomplished . ”
In March 2004 , he said , “ I ’m confident we ’re on the right course . ”
In December 2005 , he said , “ Overall , I think a year from now , we will have made a fair amount of progress if we stay the course . ”
15 . McCain has changed his mind about a long - term U.S. military presence in Iraq on multiple occasions , concluding , on multiple occasions , that a Korea - like presence is both a good and a bad idea .
16 . McCain was against additional U.S. forces in Afghanistan before he was for it .
17 . McCain said before the war in Iraq , “ We will win this conflict .
We will win it easily . ”
Four years later , McCain said he knew all along that the war in Iraq war was “ probably going to be long and hard and tough . ”
18 . McCain has repeatedly said it ’s a dangerous mistake to tell the “ enemy ” when U.S. troops would be out of Iraq .
In May , McCain announced that most American troops would be home from Iraq by 2013 .
19 . McCain was against expanding the GI Bill before he was for it .
20 . McCain staunchly opposed Obama ’s Iraq withdrawal timetable , and even blasted Mitt Romney for having referenced the word during the GOP primaries .
In July , after Iraqi officials endorsed Obama ’s policy , McCain said a 16 - month calendar sounds like “ a pretty good timetable . ”
Domestic Policy
21 . McCain defended “ privatizing ” Social Security .
Now he says he ’s against privatization ( though he actually still supports it . )
22 . On Social Security , McCain said he would not , under any circumstances , raise taxes .
Soon after , asked about a possible increase in the payroll tax , McCain said there ’s “ nothing that ’s off the table . ”
23 . McCain wanted to change the Republican Party platform to protect abortion rights in cases of rape and incest .
Now he does n’t .
24 . McCain supported storing spent nuclear fuel at Yucca Mountain in Nevada .
Now he believes the opposite .
25 .
He argued the NRA should not have a role in the Republican Party ’s policy making .
Now he believes the opposite .
26 .
In 1998 , he championed raising cigarette taxes to fund programs to cut underage smoking , insisting that it would prevent illnesses and provide resources for public health programs .
Now , McCain opposes a $ 0.61 - per - pack tax increase , wo n’t commit to supporting a regulation bill he ’s co-sponsoring , and has hired Philip Morris ’ former lobbyist as his senior campaign adviser .
27 . McCain is both for and against earmarks for Arizona .
28 . McCain ’s first mortgage plan was premised on the notion that homeowners facing foreclosure should n’t be “ rewarded ” for acting “ irresponsibly . ”
His second mortgage plan took largely the opposite position .
29 . McCain went from saying gay marriage should be allowed , to saying gay marriage should n’t be allowed .
30 . McCain opposed a holiday to honor Martin Luther King , Jr. , before he supported it .
31 . McCain was anti-ethanol .
Now he ’s pro-ethanol .
32 . McCain was both for and against state promotion of the Confederate flag .
33 .
In 2005 , McCain endorsed intelligent design creationism , a year later he said the opposite , and a few months after that , he was both for and against creationism at the same time .
34 .
And on gay adoption , McCain initially said he ’d rather let orphans go without families , then his campaign reversed course , and soon after , McCain reversed back .
35 .
In the Senate , McCain opposed a variety of measures on equal pay for women , and endorsed the Supreme Court ’s Ledbetter decision .
In July , however , McCain said , “ I ’m committed to making sure that there ’s equal pay for equal work .
That … is my record and you can count on it . ”
36 . McCain was against fully funding the No Child Left Behind Act before he was for it .
37 . McCain was for affirmative action before he was against it .
38 . McCain said the Colorado River compact will “ obviously ” need to be “ renegotiated . ”
Six days later , McCain said , “ Let me be clear that I do not advocate renegotiation of the compact . ”
Economic Policy
39 . McCain was against Bush ’s tax cuts for the very wealthy before he was for them .
40 . John McCain initially argued that economics is not an area of expertise for him , saying , “ I ’m going to be honest : I know a lot less about economics than I do about military and foreign policy issues ; I still need to be educated , ” and “ The issue of economics is not something I ’ve understood as well as I should . ”
He now falsely denies ever having made these remarks and insists that he has a “ very strong ” understanding of economics .
41 . McCain vowed , if elected , to balance the federal budget by the end of his first term .
Soon after , he decided he would no longer even try to reach that goal .
And soon after that , McCain abandoned his second position and went back to his first .
42 . McCain said in 2005 that he opposed the tax cuts because they were “ too tilted to the wealthy . ”
By 2007 , he denied ever having said this , and falsely argued that he opposed the cuts because of increased government spending .
43 . McCain thought the estate tax was perfectly fair .
Now he believes the opposite .
44 . McCain pledged in February 2008 that he would not , under any circumstances , raise taxes .
Specifically , McCain was asked if he is a “ ‘ read my lips ’ candidate , no new taxes , no matter what ? ” referring to George H.W. Bush ’s 1988 pledge .
“ No new taxes , ” McCain responded .
Two weeks later , McCain said , “ I ’m not making a ‘ read my lips ’ statement , in that I will not raise taxes . ”
45 . McCain has changed his entire economic worldview on multiple occasions .
46 . McCain believes Americans are both better and worse off economically than they were before Bush took office .
47 . McCain was against massive government bailouts of “ big banks ” that “ act irresponsibly . ”

50 . McCain endorsed a cap - and - trade policy with a mandatory emissions cap .
In mid-June , McCain announced he wants the caps to voluntary .
51 . McCain explained his belief that a temporary suspension of the federal gas tax would provide an immediate economic stimulus .
Shortly thereafter , he argued the exact opposite .
52 . McCain supported the Lieberman / Warner legislation to combat global warming .
Now he does n’t .
53 . McCain was for national auto emissions standards before he was against them .

In 2007 , he announced his opposition to the bill .
In 2008 , McCain switched back .
55 .
On immigration policy in general , McCain announced in February 2008 that he would vote against his own bill .
56 .
In April , McCain promised voters that he would secure the borders “ before proceeding to other reform measures . ”

Judicial Policy and the Rule of Law
57 . McCain said he would “ not impose a litmus test on any nominee . ”
He used to promise the opposite .
58 . McCain ’s position was that the telecoms should be forced to explain their role in the administration ’s warrantless surveillance program as a condition for retroactive immunity .
He used to believe the opposite .
59 . McCain went from saying he would not support repeal of Roe v. Wade to saying the exact opposite .

71 . In 2000 , McCain accused Texas businessmen Sam and Charles Wyly of being corrupt , spending “ dirty money ” to help finance Bush ’s presidential campaign .
McCain not only filed a complaint against the Wylys for allegedly violating campaign finance law , he also lashed out at them publicly .
In April , McCain reached out to the Wylys for support .
72 . McCain was against presidential candidates campaigning at Bob Jones University before he was for it .
73 . McCain decided in 2000 that he did n’t want anything to do with former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger , believing he “ would taint the image of the ‘ Straight Talk Express . ' ”
Kissinger is now the Honorary Co-Chair for his presidential campaign in New York .

Last Saturday , JJ Abrams was a presenter at the Hollywood Life Magazine Young Hollywood Awards and AP caught up with him to talk a little Trek .
As per usual , the Star Trek director was n’t talking plot details beyond saying “ It ’s a chance to see what Kirk and Spock would look like done now , ” but was keeping up the mainstream media message that the film is a new kind of Trek for both the fans and for non-fans .
JJ Abrams ( a big Star Wars fan ) on why he took on Star Trek :
It was an opportunity to take what I think has been a maligned world to sound crass , a franchise and treat it in a way that made it something that I wanted to see .
To take the characters , the thoughtfulness , the personalities , the sense of adventure , the idea of humanity working together , the sense of social commentary and innovation , all that stuff .
To take it and apply it in a way that felt genuinely thrilling .
On the audience for the film ( and how Bob Orci is keeping it real for the fans ) :
The whole point was to try to make this movie for fans of movies , not fans of ` Star Trek , ’ necessarily .
If you ’re a fan , we ’ve got one of the writers who ’s a devout Trekker , so we were able to make sure we were serving the people who are completely enamored with ` Star Trek . ’
But we are not making the movie for that contingent alone .
You ca n’t really make a movie for them .
As soon as you start to guess what you think they are going to want to see , you ’re in trouble .
You have to make the movie in many ways for what you want to see yourself , make a movie you believe in .
Then you ’re not second - guessing an audience you do n’t really have an understanding of .
On how this is a new kind of Star Trek :
I feel like this is so unlike what you expect , so unlike the ` Star Trek ’ you ’ve seen .
At the same time , it ’s being true to what ’s come before , honoring it , I can say the effects for ` Star Trek ’ have never , ever been done like this .
…
I can only tell you the idea of the universe of ` Star Trek ’ has never been given this kind of treatment .

The nation ’s employers eliminated tens of thousands of jobs in June for the sixth consecutive month in a steady chipping away of the work force that seems likely to leave the economy very weak through Election Day .
Responding quickly to the government employment report , issued Thursday , the presidential candidates called for action , beyond the recent stimulus package , to reverse the deterioration .
In past downturns , the Federal Reserve saved the day , or tried to , by cutting interest rates .
This time , however , with the Fed having already cut rates drastically , appeals are increasingly going to the White House and Congress .
“ The numbers are telling us that there is an ongoing deterioration in the labor market at a relatively rapid clip , ” said Jan Hatzius , chief domestic economist at Goldman Sachs .
“ It is a sign that the fiscal stimulus , the tax rebates , are failing to lift the broader economy . ”
Apart from the 62,000 jobs eliminated in June  and 438,000 since January  most workers lost ground to inflation last month , the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported .
While the average weekly wage of most ordinary workers was up 2.8 percent in the 12 months through June , the Consumer Price Index was up more than 4 percent .
Edwards endorsement pays off for Obama Associated Press
Published : Thursday May 15 , 2008

Print This Email This Barack Obama picked up four of John Edwards ' 19 delegates as the former rival 's endorsement began to pay off .
Edwards endorsed Obama on Wednesday night .
Hours later , some of Edwards ' delegates followed suit , adding to Obama 's growing lead in delegates needed to win the nomination .
Obama is now just 135 delegates shy of the number needed to clinch .
Edwards won 19 delegates in three states before dropping out of the race in January .
They are now free to support whomever they want , regardless of Edwards ' endorsement .
Several , however , said the endorsement is important to their decision .
Obama picked up three delegates in South Carolina and one in New Hampshire , both states that held their primaries in January .
It would have meant more in February or March , but John Edwards ' endorsement of Barack Obama for the Democratic presidential nomination was welcomed nonetheless by a politician eager to turn the page .
Edwards ' surprise appearance at a rally Wednesday steered some of the attention away from Hillary Rodham Clinton 's landslide win over Obama in Tuesday 's West Virginia primary .
Despite the victory , the former first lady faces long odds in trying to deny Obama the presidential nomination .
Edwards had been their chief rival from 2007 through last January .
But after finishing second to Obama in Iowa , the former North Carolina senator and 2004 vice presidential nominee placed third in the next three contests , then left the race .
Obama and Clinton immediately sought his support , but Edwards stayed mum until Wednesday .
The endorsement would have carried more clout had Edwards made it months ago , when the outcome of the Democratic contest was very much in doubt .
" We are here tonight because the Democratic voters have made their choice , and so have I , " Edwards said to thunderous applause .
He said Obama " stands with me " in a fight to cut poverty in half within 10 years , a claim Obama confirmed moments later .
Edwards told the rally that " we must come together as Democrats " to defeat Republican John McCain in November .
He also praised Clinton .
" We are a stronger party " because of her involvement and " we 're going to have a stronger nominee in the fall because of her work , " he said .
Then as Edwards sat on stage and watched , Obama gave one of his most animated addresses in days , much of it devoted to fighting poverty .
In America , he said , " you should never be homeless , you should never be hungry . "
Clinton campaign chairman Terry McAuliffe said in a statement : " We respect John Edwards , but as the voters of West Virginia showed last night , this thing is far from over . "
Political strategist and Clinton ally James Carville said Edwards ' endorsement was a psychological boost for Obama , but unlikely to sway many voters .
" I think it certainly helps in terms of the psychology of the superdelegates , " Carville told ABC's " Good Morning America " on Thursday , referring to the elected officials and party leaders who will ultimately determine the Democratic nominee .
A person close to Edwards , speaking on condition of anonymity , said he wanted to get involved now to begin unifying the party .
Edwards and Obama spoke by phone Tuesday night , and Edwards agreed to fly to Grand Rapids the next day .
Edwards did n't even tell many of his former top advisers of his decision because he wanted to inform Clinton personally , said the person close to him .
His wife , Elizabeth , who has said she thinks Clinton has the superior health care plan , did not accompany him and is not part of the endorsement .

One thing has always annoyed me about the script tag .
Script tags that reference external resources ( via the src attribute ) are no longer able to execute script embedded within the tag itself .
It does n’t make sense to me that we ’re forced to write :
< script src=" some-lib.js " ></ script > < script > var foo = use_some_lib ( ) ; foo.do.stuff ( ) ; </ script >
when this is so much more elegant :
< script src=" some-lib.js " > var foo = use_some_lib ( ) ; foo.do.stuff ( ) ; </ script >
Only one tag – and the semantics would work like this :
The external script would attempt to be loaded ( as normal ) .
If the load and execution was error - free then the internal script would be executed as well .
If the load or execution failed then the internal script would not be executed ( this being the important distinction from the first example , shown above ) .
We can verify these two facts with some tests :
Test 1 : Verify that internal scripts are n’t executed , even if an external src is loaded .
Test 2 : Verify that internal scripts are n’t executed , even if an external src is not loaded .
Running the tests in Firefox , Opera , Safari , and IE show them all passing ( the internal scripts are unable to execute ) .
With this knowledge in place now , let ’s get to the juicy part :
How do we actually implement the above style of script - tag - writing in a way that melds well with our desired style of development ?
It ’s actually terribly simple .
I took a copy of jQuery and tacked the following two lines on to the end of the script :
var scripts = document.getElementsByTagName(" script " ) ; eval ( scripts [ scripts.length - 1 ].innerHTML ) ;
Taking a look at a demo shows it working , using only one script tag :
< script src=" jquery1.js " > j Query ( document ) .ready ( function ( ) { j Query ( " p " ) .addClass ( " pretty " ) ; } ) ; </ script >
We have succeeded !
but how does the above code work ?
The short snippet takes advantage of the way in which script tags are loaded and executed .
Each script tag within a page may be downloaded in any order ( for example , Internet Explorer 8 and Firefox 3.1 are starting to download many scripts in parallel ) .
BUT their execution must come in order AND they must be executed in their exact place in the DOM .
This means that when the script finally executes that it ’ll be the last script in the DOM – and even the last element in the DOM ( the rest of the DOM is built incrementally as it hits more script tags , or until the end of the document ) .
This particular behavior occurs because scripts are able to document .
write , affecting the very nature of the document .
The following is perfectly legal ( even if you can imagine the trauma that it must cause browser vendors – preventing them from performing some perfectly good optimizations ) :
< script>document.write ('<' + '!--');</script > < script src='some_external_script.js '></script > < script>document.write ('-->') ;</ script>
With the above taken in mind – let ’s consider a further optimization to our code .
While the above code snippet is generic to any external source file , what if we were to take advantage of the nature of jQuery , simplifying its behavior ?
Virtually all jQuery - using code is encased within a call to the document ready function ( which delays execution of attached handlers until the DOM is full loaded ) .
If we were to make some adjustments to our script addition , like so :
var scripts = document.getElementsByTagName(" script " ) ; var script = scripts [ scripts.
length - 1 ].innerHTML
; if ( script ) { j Query ( document ) .ready ( function ( ) { jQuery.globalEval ( script ) ; } ) ; }
We can now get the full advantage of having our scripts inline and not having to write out a document ready call , like so :
< script src=" jquery2.js " > j Query ( " p " ) .addClass ( " pretty " ) ; </ script >
Pretty sexy , huh ?
The only thing holding me back from blindly adding the above snippet directly in to jQuery , today , is a small possibility :
The chance that someone could copy the full library and stick it in an embedded script tag ( rather than calling it from an external file ) .
Right now if you were to stick either of the above snippets in an embedded script tag you would end up with a never - ending loop .
Consider this code :
< script > var scripts = document.getElementsByTagName(" script " ) ; eval ( scripts [ scripts.length - 1 ].innerHTML ) ; </ script >
This code would look for the last script on the page , find it ( it would be the script itself ) , and execute – causing a piece of recursion to occur .
It would become necessary to flag the script to prevent it from executing again .
With a little bit of extra work , we can make it possible ( demo ) :
( function ( ) { var scripts = document.getElementsByTagName(" script " ) ; var curScript = scripts [ scripts.length - 1 ] ; if ( curScript .
executed ) return ; // ... jQuery ... curScript.executed = true ; var script = curScript.innerHTML
; if ( script ) { j Query ( document ) .ready ( function ( ) { jQuery.globalEval ( script ) ; } ) ; } } ) ( ) ;
I think this particular technique could serve to simplify a number of web pages , even if it ’s only because :
There ’s one less script tag on the page .
The dependency link between the script being loaded and the script being executed becomes exceedingly obvious .
The dependent script wo n’t execute ( and subsequently cause errors ) if the external script is unable to load .
The need for user - authored window load , document ready , etc. functions are no longer necessary ( can be hidden within the library ) .
It ’s definitely something that ’ll need to be mulled over as it ’s pretty fundamentally changing the existing behavior of the script tag ( although , it is being done in a completely safe and backwards - compatible manner ) .
But if there ’s sufficient interest it seems as if this is one area in which external scripts could stand to offer an obvious improvement to the developer .
Washington , D.C. - A transition to renewable energy sources promises significant global job gains at a time when the coal industry has been hemorrhaging jobs for years , according to the latest Vital Signs Update released by the Worldwatch Institute .
The coal , oil , and natural gas industries require steadily fewer jobs as high - cost production equipment takes the place of human capital .
Many hundreds of thousands of coal mining jobs have been shed in China , the United States , Germany , the United Kingdom , and South Africa during the last two decades , sometimes in the face of expanding production .
In the United States alone , coal industry employment has fallen by half in the last 20 years , despite a one - third increase in production .
! ADVERTISEMENT !
" Renewables are poised to tackle our energy crisis and create millions of new jobs worldwide , " according to Worldwatch Senior Researcher Michael Renner .
" Meanwhile , fossil fuel jobs are increasingly becoming fossils themselves , as coal mining communities and others worry about their livelihoods . "
Strong government support has allowed Germany , Spain , and Denmark to emerge as leaders in renewable energy development - and green jobs .
The German government reports that the country was home to an estimated 259,000 direct and indirect jobs in the renewables sector in 2006 .
This figure is expected to reach 400,000 - 500,000 by 2020 , and 710,000 by 2030 .
In the United States , the renewables sector employed close to 200,000 people directly and 246,000 indirectly in 2006 , due mostly to leadership at the state level .
China is rapidly catching up in manufacturing of solar photovoltaics ( PV ) and wind turbines and is already the dominant global force in solar hot water development .
An estimated 2.3 million people worldwide currently work either directly in renewables or indirectly in supplier industries .
The solar thermal industry employs at least 624,000 people , the wind power industry 300,000 , and the solar PV industry 170,000 .
More than 1 million people work in the biomass and biofuels sector , while small - scale hydropower employs 39,000 individuals and geothermal employs 25,000 .
These figures are expected to swell substantially as private investment and government support for alternative energy sources grow .
The most optimistic analyses project that global wind power employment will increase to as much as 2.1 million in 2030 and 2.8 million in 2050 .
Similar projections estimate that worldwide solar PV production alone could create as many as 6.3 million jobs by 2030 .
" Government officials now have yet another reason to put the full weight of their support behind renewables , " said Renner .
" In addition to protecting our planet and phasing out an increasingly limited resource , policies that support renewable energy also support job creation . "

NIST ’s explanation for the collapse of World Trade Center 7 on September 11th follows the logic in the cartoon at left .
Specifically , NIST claims that the collapse of building 7 is " the first known instance of fire causing the total collapse of a tall building " .
But then goes on to argue :
" The fires in WTC 7 , which were uncontrolled but otherwise similar to fires experienced in other tall buildings , caused an extraordinary event "
In fact , the fires in WTC 7 were orders of magnitude less than other high - rise fires , which did not produce collapses .
My parody from yesterday is not much sillier than NIST ’s real explanation .

Al - Hayat reports in Arabic that the Iraqi government is about to send troops into Diyala in an attempt to tamp down violence and combat local militias there , just as was done in Basra , Maysan and Mosul .
I have begun to wonder whether the secret of these campaigns is not so much the show of military force as the behind - the - scene bribes given by the government to insurgents to go find another line of work .
It still boggles my mind that Mosul could be taken without a shot ( though it has suffered from terrorism strikes in the aftermath .
The periodic waves of euphoria that wash over the political class and some of the media in Washington cause serious security risks in Iraq to be forgotten .
Al - Maliki sent some troops to Basra ?
OK , Basra is fine , we can forget about it .
In fact , the situation there , while improved , is far from stable or assured .
I suspect trying to do more to ensure that this key province does not go south ( it is the source of most of Iraq ’s petroleum wealth and the site of two major ports , without which Iraq would be landlocked ) is one reason PM Gordon Brown has decided not to pull out of Iraq , and , indeed , to send a few more troops there to train Iraqi soldiers .
Finance Minister Bayan Jabr Sulagh argues that Iraq ’s newfound windfall from greatly increased petroleum revenues can help the country grow its way out of crisis .
I hope so , but a word of caution is in order .
Iran and Algeria are also oil states , and one had a revolution and the other a sanguinary civil war .
It is n’t that you have petroleum income .
It is how exactly you deploy it .
Alexandra Davis points out that Iraq ’s election law is still incomplete , casting doubt about whether provincial elections will be held this fall .
Not only that , but cabinet - level decisions such as whether to allow the display of photos of religious personages in connection with political campaigns will now be review and possibly changed by the parliament .
Zavis also reports that Baghdad is putting in solar - powered street lamps .
It is hoped that they will reduce crime and violence .
The regular electricity grid is unreliable .
By the way , the LAT quotes a general suggesting that solar electricity generation is six or seven times as expensive as with fossil fuels .
Is n’t that estimate out of date ?
I thought it was down to only three times .
Engineers , please weigh in .
Baghdad joins my own city of Ann Arbor in this project of solarized street lamps .
“ At least 16 Iraqis were killed and 20 more were wounded in the latest round of violence .
One U.S. soldier died from a non-combat related incident as well , ” according to antiwar.com .

Heath Ledger : The Dark Knight Massive Billboard Photos
appears as The Joker on a giant billboard advertising The Dark Knight on Houston Street .
The ad was placed just two blocks from the Tribeca apartment building in Manhattan , where the actor died of an accidental overdose of prescription medication in January 2008 .
The billboard advertisement heralds the release of the long awaited Batman flick that will open in theaters on July 18th .
Ledgers fellow actors are vocal about their co-stars chances of being nominated for an Oscar .
Christian Bale said :
" I do think that Heath has created an iconic villain that will stand for the ages , and of course , I would love to see him get an award .
But you know , to me , you can witness his talent , celebrate his talent with this movie .
Anything else is gravy .
Heath has done a phenomenal enough job that I would not be surprised if he won . "
Seven actors have receive posthumous Oscar nominations , and only Australian actorwon posthumously for his performance in the 1976 movie Network .
He died of a heart attack prior to the awards show .

My sister , Karen , directed me to this quote People Magazine .
This says a lot more about John McCain than Sarah Palin :
Sen. McCain , of all the candidates you considered , what drew you to her ?
JOHN : Obviously , I found her to be very intelligent and very well - versed on the issues .
But I think the important thing was that she ’s a reformer .
She ’s taken on special interests since she ran for the PTA and the city council and mayor .
The courage , I guess , is what most impressed me .
That ’s what most impressed John McCain .
Granted , McCain does n’t really know Palin , but that ’s still frightening .
Knowledge and understanding of all the foreign policy crises to which McCain is always referring — al Qaeda , Islamo - facists , Iran , Russia , Georgia — that stuff does n’t really matter if one stands up to the special interests at the Wasilla PTA , according to John McCain .
John McCain showed once again that he does n’t have the mindset to be President .
Red Hat has warned that hackers were able to commandeer its systems and tamper with code - but said that since its content distribution was not hit , it is confident that polluted code has not served up to users .
The first hint that something was wrong came last week when Fedora rebuilt its systems , a reconstruction that was accompanied by extended outages .
Red Hat sponsors the Linux distribution .
Fortunately Fedora packages were n't interfered with following the attack , but Red Hat Enterprise Linux packages were touched up by as yet unidentified miscreants .
" Last week Red Hat detected an intrusion on certain of its computer systems and took immediate action , " Red Hat said in a critical security advisory issued on Friday .
" While the investigation into the intrusion is ongoing , our initial focus was to review and test the distribution channel we use with our customers . "
While checks on its content distribution networks came back clean , it did turn up some problems .
" An intruder was able to sign a small number of OpenSSH packages relating only to Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 ( i386 and x86_64 architectures only ) and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 ( x86_64 architecture only ) .
" As a precautionary measure , we are releasing an updated version of these packages , and have published a list of the tampered packages and how to detect them here . "
In a parallel posting to the Fedora announce mailing list early on Friday morning Paul Frields , Fedora project leader , confirmed that an intrusion by computer hackers had prompted the unprecedented rebuild by the Linux distribution , which is sponsored by Red Hat .
" Last week we discovered that some Fedora servers were illegally accessed .
The intrusion into the servers was quickly discovered , and the servers were taken offline .
" Security specialists and administrators have been working since then to analyze the intrusion and the extent of the compromise as well as reinstall Fedora systems . "
Among the compromised Fedora servers was a machine used for signing Fedora packages .
Following a forensic examination , the Linux distribution is convinced that hackers were not able to capture the passphrase used to secure the Fedora package signing key .
" Based on our review to date , the passphrase was not used during the time of the intrusion on the system and the passphrase is not stored on any of the Fedora servers , " Frields writes .
Nonetheless , as a precaution , Fedora has changed its signing key .
Access to the key would have potentially allowed hackers to offer up code with built - in backdoors carrying the Fedora hallmark , the risk Red Hat is grappling with in the case of the doctored OpenSSH packages .
Fedora has carried out checks that suggest the integrity of its packages and source code have not been affected by the breach .
It said it was simply playing it safe when it advised users to hold off from downloads last week , a piece of advice that stoked speculation that a security breach was behind the then unexplained outage .
" The effects of the intrusion on Fedora and Red Hat are not the same , " Frields added .
" Accordingly , the Fedora package signing key is not connected to , and is different from , the one used to sign Red Hat Enterprise Linux packages . " ®
The former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic lived under US protection after the Dayton peace accords until the CIA intercepted a phone call in which he broke the terms of a " secret deal " to stay out of politics , a Serbian newspaper claims .
" Karadzic , indicted for genocide and war crimes , was under US protection until 2000 , when the CIA intercepted his telephone conversation that clearly proved he personally chaired a meeting of his old political party , " the Belgrade daily Blic quoted a " well - informed US intelligence source " as saying .
" They went crazy realising Karadzic was making a fool of them , " it said yesterday .
" The US and CIA withdrew [ his ] informal protection . "
Mr Karadzic has revived the allegations of a deal between himself and the chief US peace negotiator in Bosnia , Richard Holbrooke , since appearing before the UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague last Thursday .
Mr Holbrooke has denied any deals with Mr Karadzic , telling CNN last Thursday that this was a " flat - out lie " .
" He 's been spreading it for 12 years through his friends , now he 's making it personally .
It would have been morally reprehensible and illegal to do such a thing ...
We made no deal , " Mr Holbrooke said .
However , statements by two top officials of the former warring sides seem to confirm the deal .
The former Bosnian Serb foreign minister Aleksa Buha told Belgrade Radio he witnessed the agreement .
He said the deal was made " in the night between 18 and 19 July 1996 " .
The former Bosnian foreign minister Mohamed Sacirbey told the Mostar paper Dnevni that he learnt about the deal through the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe 's head of mission , the US diplomat Robert Frowick , in the summer of 1996 .

In my June , 2007 newsletter article I talked about how to organize IT , but I did n’t address one of the questions that keeps coming up during a bad economic climate : how do we deal with executives who want to cut the number of IT managers by increasing the span of control for each manager ?
Span of control , for those unfamiliar with the phrase , refers to the number of people reporting directly to a manager .
So , for example , a manager with 10 people reporting to him has a span of control of 10 , and a manager with 100 people reporting to her has a span of control of 100 .
Cost - cutting consultants like to look at the average span of control for the managers in each organization , and any organization with a low average is immediately a target for elimination of manager jobs .
IT manager jobs are particularly good targets because no one outside of IT understands the IT manager role .
And what you do n’t understand , you tend to eliminate ; at least that ’s the way a lot of cost - cutting consultants think .
But the reality is that the “ right ” number for span of control depends on a number of factors that are n’t usually taken into account when these cost - cutting consultants go looking .
This article will provide you with some ammunition to fight back if you ’re confronted with accusations that your own organization has a low average span of control .
The Basics
The idea behind span of control is fairly simple .
You as a manager have a requirement to spend a certain amount of time each week doing non-management tasks , and you spend the remainder of your time managing your employees .
Let ’s take a simple example .
Let ’s say that you spend a total of 50 hours per week working ( anything over 50 will be reserved for unplanned use ) .
Now let ’s say that 20 hours of your week will be eaten up by work not related to people management .
The actual number will vary greatly depending on how much “ individual contributor ” work you have to do as part of your job , how much time you spend with your boss , how much travel you do , and how much time you spend with your peers .
Subtracting 20 from 50 leaves 30 hours per week to manage people .
If on average you need to spend 2 hours per employee per week , then you can handle 15 employees ( 30 / 2 = 15 ) .
If you need to spend 4 hours per employee per week , then you can only handle 8 employees .
And if , in the other extreme , you only need to spend 1 / 2 hour per employee per week , then you can handle 60 employees .
In these examples , your span of control would be 15 , 8 or 60 .
The Factors that Influence the Required Manager Time Per Employee
Why would one manager need to spend 4 hours per week per employee ( or even more ) while another manager might only require 1 /2 hour or less ?
Here are the factors that affect the number :
1 . Is the work well - defined and well - understood ?
Employees who are doing simple repetitive work typically require very little time from management .
The employees know what they ’re doing , they do it the same way each time so there ’s very little reason for asking questions , and they know how they ’re measured .
A manager only gets involved in the rare cases when a new employee is needed , when an employee has an occasional problem that requires management intervention , and for periodic goal and performance discussions .
On the other hand , consider the case where employees are doing a new type of work for the first time , the work requires a high degree of skill , there are many decisions to be made that require a manager , and training must be provided to the employees before they can perform useful work .
Clearly this situation requires a lot more manager time per employee to ensure productive employees .
2 . Have your employees been in their jobs a long time ?
Experienced employees with long tenure have very little need for management ( and you ’ll often hear them griping about this very subject ) .
As long as the work and environment stay the same , a large number of these employees can be managed by just one person .
But make sure that no change is imminent , because when change is required to this sort of organization , it ’s going to take even more management time than would normally be needed , since people who are set in their ways are usually reluctant to change .
3 . Are job or working conditions changing ?
One of the primary duties of a manager is to implement change .
When things are changing , more time is required between the manager and his / her employees .
Even if the work is constant , change can include an alteration in physical location or environment , a change in the number of people available to do the work ( a decrease due to downsizing or an increase due to business growth ) , or a change in the pace of the work .
If there is no change , then less manager time is required , and a higher span of control will work effectively .
But during times of change this high span of control will interfere with successful change implementation ; more manager - to - employee time is needed .
4 . Do the employees help each other ?
In many working environments it ’s reasonable and appropriate for experienced employees to help newer employees learn the job and its subtleties .
Sometimes we call these experienced people “ project leaders ” or “ team leaders ; ” other times it ’s just an informal mentoring relationship .
When help from other employees is possible , it relieves the manager of some of these responsibilities , and it allows a higher span of control .
But when the workers are physically separated ( for example , support people based in different remote facilities ) , or when pay - for - performance motivation or union regulations reduce the likelihood of this sort of help , then the manager has to spend more time bringing each new employee up to speed .
5 . Is there a high variation in the type of job working for the manager ?
If all of your employees are doing the same thing ( for example , a help desk organization ) , then it ’s possible to use group instruction to communicate the same message to many employees at once .
If , on the other hand , each of your employees is doing a different type of job , then more individualized communication is required , and this requires a lower span of control .
6 . Do you have a separate training and / or coaching organization ?
Some companies split the traditional management responsibilities , keeping employee accountability with the employee ’s manager but moving responsibility for training and coaching elsewhere .
This type of organization appears to allow a higher span of control , but in fact it usually just spreads the span of control across the different parts of the organization ( see my June , 2007 newsletter article for more about matrix organizations ) .
If you use this approach in your organization , you should be especially careful when your company looks to reduce costs .
Separate training and coaching organizations are easy targets for cost - cutting ( even more popular than managers with a low span of control ) , and when those organizations are eliminated , the managers will have to pick up the slack .
Sure , having a separate training or coaching organization may allow a higher span of control now , but make sure the span of control goes down if that training or coaching organization is eliminated .
7 . Is your organization on the trailing edge of new technology or on the leading edge ?
If your organization is using leading edge technology , then the number of problems associated with the new technology will require more attention , more decisions , and more management time .
On the other hand , if your organization lets other companies do the pioneering , and you use technology that ’s already been proven , then a higher span of control might be possible .
8 . What is the ratio of technology investment per employee in this organization ?
In a highly leveraged organization with many millions of dollars of technology investment being installed or supported by each IT employee , it makes sense to provide more management oversight to reduce the possibility of problems .
In this type of organization , the span of control should be kept lower to provide that required oversight , and to make sure that your high technology investment is protected .
Conclusion
Span of control is one of those things that ’s easy to attack when a company is desperately searching for ways to reduce cost .
There may be certain situations in IT organizations when management jobs should be eliminated , but it ’s dangerous to make a generalized attack on an IT management job just because it has a low span of control .
First , consider that many IT manager jobs require a large amount of time for individual contributor tasks that have nothing to do with managing people .
Many IT managers are doers ; in addition to their management role they also have to roll up their sleeves and work beside their employees on the front lines .
This gives them less time to spend actually managing employees , and so their span of control number is deceptively low .
Second , look at what happens when you increase the span of control above a reasonable number for a given situation :
Employees do n’t get the support and encouragement they need , morale drops , and employee turnover increases .
Employee resources are wasted due to miscommunication and rework .
Employees do n’t get adequate supervision , and they sometimes end up making decisions that are n’t in the best interest of the company .
When evaluating the need for a change in the span of control , consider the answers to the eight questions in this article .
You ’ll find some cases where a greater span of control is possible , but it ’s important to weigh the trade - offs .
Will that increase in span of control result in ineffective use of new technology ?
Will it make your IT organization inflexible and unresponsive to change ?
Will you end up costing your company more money than you ’ll save ?
It ’s important to know the answers .
And it ’s important to push back at consultants who want to increase your span of control if the evidence shows that it will hurt your company .

Over the week - end , I put together a rudimentary rewrite - by - example feature for the rewrite gem ( please be patient , I wo n’t be adding this feature to the gem until it has gone through a few more design iterations ) .
The first thing I tried to do with it was simulating unhygienic macros
What this code produces is a sexp - rewriter that does a global search - and - replace .
It looks for code like this :
And replaces it inline with : Declarative rewriting by example is a darn sight better than hand - written sexp manipulation :
But back to rewriting by example :
As you can deduce , it is using some magic symbols .
In the “ from ” part of the definition , __to_receiver and __to_message mean “ Match something here and name the result receiver and message respectively , ” while __splat_parameters means “ Match a list of things here and name the result parameters .
” In the “ to ” part of the definitions , those magic symbols insert whatever was matched in the from .
This is a crude approximation of how regular expressions capture things with ( ) and insert them with $ 1..$n , only there is no way to capture any arbitrary sub-pattern .
You can use any names you want , as long as they have the magic prefixes __to_ or __splat_ .
( Magic symbols are a blight upon all that is right and good with code , suggestions for a better way to express capturing by name gratefully solicited ! )
The example above is very much like a Lisp macro .
In Lisp , everything is an sexp , so of course macro invocations are sexps just as function calls are sexps .
In Ruby , some things look like function calls , some things look like method invocations .
In this particular case , “ Person.find ( : first , …).andand.friends ( true ) ” looks like a method invocation , but it actually behaves like a macro invocation .
Although it looks like a method , the rewriter version of #andand is not polymorphic .
You ca n’t override #andand in any classes , just as you ca n’t override other syntactic constructions like “ && ” or “ ! ” .
This bothers OO purists , however I am a member of the OO radical fringe who take purity to another level , a level where overriding functionality is not allowed to violate Liskov Equivalence ( I personally do not care for the idea that something like #andand sometimes means one thing and sometimes means another , just as many people would completely freak out if ! foo did n’t always mean “ not foo . ” )
Rewriting goes beyond adding new functions and verbs ( I personally consider # andand to be an adverb ) .
Basically , what we have here is an extremely weak version of XSLT for Ruby code .
Match this , turn it into that .
IMO , XSLT transformations is a much better analogy than macro expansion .
Rewriters can match and replace fairly arbitrary expressions , not just implement things that look like function calls and method calls .
Consider this hypothetical example :
This would transformation code like this :
Into this :
This is an example of an optimization .
For a large class of expressions chaining a select and an inject ( the ones that do n’t rely on side effects ) , this transformation retains the original semantics while rewriting the code to only traverse the collection once and to eliminate the creation of an intermediate collection .
Of course , compilers do this kind of thing all the time for many types of optimizations , so it ’s tempting to wait for someone else to write a sufficiently smart compiler that can figure these things out .
There are two troubles with waiting for someone else to do it .
First , we might be that someone — maybe we ’re the one who ought to Just Do It , and waiting for someone else wo n’t work because nobody else is going to do it .
Second , many problems like this are intractable in the general case .
It ’s hard ( in the mathematical sense ) to know when select {…. }.inject { … } can be transformed like this in an imperative language without accidentally stepping on some hidden side - effect .
But just because it ’s hard in the general case does n’t mean it is n’t easy in the specific case .
For example , you might be the sort of person who never knowingly relies on side effects in select and inject expressions .
So you could use this optimization , while a compiler - level optimization would be a disaster : even if 99.9 % of the code out there would n’t break , the programmers behind the 0.1 % of the broken programs would be furiously blogging about how Ruby was n’t ready for the Enterprise .
The joy and the pain of optimizing your code is that you do n’t need rewrite to perform that optimization .
The joy is that if you discover chaining select and inject is a performance hog somewhere in your code , you simply rewrite the code yourself .
The pain is that the code is no longer in the form you originally decided best represents its intent .
In the trivial example I gave above , a rewritten version looks reasonable , especially if you rewrite it with #each in an imperative style :
Now I ’m not going to say that this is necessarily more or less readable than :
Some people actively dislike using #select and #inject , so they might feel the #each version is better .
For once , let ’s talk about something other than a bike shed .
Let ’s focus on the fact that foo. select {…}. inject {…} says one thing : “ Filter this collection using this predicate , and then fold the result as follows . ”
Whereas foo.each {…} says “ Iterate over this collection doing the following thing with each element .
” If you wrote this as a #select / # inject pair , you might have a good reason for doing so .
Perhaps most of your program is written in a functional style .
Perhaps you like to signal that the there are no side effects in those snippets of code and your team share this understanding of how selects and injects are written .
Granting that you believe that #select and #inject do a better job of communicating the code ’s intent to your fellow team members , it ’s a win to optimize the code ( in the compiler or using a rewriter ) behind the scenes rather than rewrite it yourself .
The code retains its semantics and the form you have decided best expresses its intent , while using less memory and running faster .
What we have just done with our trivial example is separated two concerns :
The concerns of how to best express an algorithm and the concern of how to best implement an algorithm .
If for whatever reason — furious hand - waving to avoid arguing how to write loops — we believe that the best way to express a certain algorithm for readability is not the best way to express a certain algorithm for performance , we have two separate concerns :
How to write readable code and how to writefast code .
Does n’t it make sense to separate those concerns ?
So that the code explaining what the algorithm is supposed to do is in one place and the code expressing how to make such things go fast is in another ?
This is pure speculation here , but I am conjecturing that being able to rewrite arbitrary snippets of code could be used like a compiler optimization directive .
When debugging , you do n’t rewrite the code .
But when things have stabilized and you need to tweak performance , instead of rewriting the code , you use rewriters to do it for you , separating the concern of “ what to do ” from the concern of “ how to do it quickly . ”
Is it possible to get good at swimming late in life ?
Yes .

Swimming has always scared the hell out of me .
Despite national titles in other sports , I ’ve always fought to keep afloat .
This inability to swim well has always been one of my greatest insecurities and embarrassments .
I ’ve tried to learn to swim almost a dozen times , and each time , my heart jumps to 180 + beats - per- minute after one or two pool lengths .
It ’s indescribably exhausting and unpleasant .
No more .
In the span of less than 10 days , I ’ve gone from a 2 - length ( 2 x 20 yards / 18.39 meters ) maximum to swimming more than 40 lengths per workout in sets of 2 and 4 .
Here ’s how I did it after everything else failed , and how you can do the same …
At the end of January , a kiwi friend issued a New Year ’s resolution challenge : he would go all of 2008 without coffee or stimulants if I trained and finished an open - water 1 - kilometer race in 2008 .
I agreed .
He had grown up a competitive swimmer and convinced me that — unlike my other self - destructive habits masquerading as exercise ( no - gi BJJ , etc. ) — it was a life skill and a pleasure I needed to share with my future children .
In other words : of all the potential skills you could learn , swimming was one of the most fundamental .
So why is this post only coming out now , eight months later ?
Because I tried everything , read the “ best ” books , and still failed .
Kick boards ?
Tried them .
I barely moved at all and — as someone who is usually good at most sports — felt humiliated and left .
Hand paddles ?
Tried them .
My shoulders will never forgive me .
Is n’t swimming supposed to be low - impact ?
Strike two .
It continued for months until I was prepared to concede defeat .
Then I met Chris Sacca , formerly of Google fame and now an investor and triathlete in training , at a BBQ and told him of my plight .
Before I had a chance to finish , he cut me off :
“ I have the answer to your prayers .
It revolutionized how I swim . ”
That got my attention .
The Method
He introduced me to Total Immersion ( TI ) , a method usually associated with coach Terry Laughlin , and I immediately ordered the book and freestyle DVD .
In the first workout — I ’ve never had a coach or supervision — I cut my drag and water resistance at least 50 % , swimming more laps than ever before in my life .
By the fourth workout , I had gone from 25 + strokes per 20 - yard length to an average of 11 strokes per 20 - yard length .
Unbelievable .
In other words , I was covering more than twice the distance with the same number of strokes , with less than 1 / 2 the effort , and with no panic or stress .
In fact , I felt better after leaving the pool than before getting in .
I could n’t — and still ca n’t — believe it .
Here are my notes from the Total Immersion book , which I would recommend reading after watching the Freestyle Made Easy DVD , as the drills are near - impossible to understand otherwise .
I was actually unable to do the exercises from pages 110 – 150 ( I cannot float horizontally and have a weak kick ) and became frustrated until the DVD enabled me to attempt technique with propulsion .
The theories and explanation after the DVD , however , will change how you view all of it :
My Top 8 Tips for Novices
Here are the principles that made the biggest difference for me :
1 ) To propel yourself forward with the least effort , focus on shoulder roll and keeping your body horizontal ( least resistance ) , not pulling with your arms or kicking with your legs .
This is counter - intuitive but important , as kicking harder is the most universal suggestion for fixing swimming issues .
2 ) Keep yourself horizontal by keeping your head in line with your spine — you should be looking straight down .
Use the same head position as while walking and drive your arm underwater vs. swimming on the surface .
See Shinji Takeuchi ’s underwater shots at :49 seconds at and Natalie Coughlin ’s explanation at : 26 seconds .
Notice how little Shinji uses his legs ; the small flick serves only to help him turn his hips and drive his next arm forward .
This is the technique that allows me to conserve so much energy .
[ youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJpFVvho0o4&hl=en&fs=1]
A good demonstration of a TI crawl .
[ youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkt31KITQro&hl=en&fs=1]
3 . In line with the above video of Shinji , think of swimming freestyle as swimming on alternating sides , not on your stomach .
From the TI Wikipedia page :
“ Actively streamline ” the body throughout the stroke cycle through a focus on rhythmically alternating “ streamlined right side ” and “ streamlined left side ” positions and consciously keeping the bodyline longer and sleeker than is typical for human swimmers .
For those who have rock climbed or done bouldering , it ’s just like moving your hip closer to a wall to get more extension .
To test this : stand chest to a wall and reach as high as you can with your right arm .
Then turn your right hip so it ’s touching the wall and reach again with your right arm : you ’ll gain 3 - 6 ″ .
Lengthen your vessel and you travel further on each stroke .
It adds up fast .
4 . Penetrate the water with your fingers angled down and fully extend your arm well beneath your head .
Extend it lower and further than you think you should .
This downward water pressure on the arms will bring your legs up and decrease drag .
It will almost feel like you ’re swimming downhill .
I highly recommend watching the “ Hand Position and Your Balance ” video at the top of this page here .
5 . Focus on increasing stroke length ( SL ) instead of stroke rate ( SR ) .
Attempt to glide further on each downstroke and decrease the number of strokes per lap .
6. Forget about workouts and focus on “ practice . ”
You are training your nervous system to perform counter - intuitive movements well , not training your aerobic system .
If you feel strained , you ’re not using the proper technique .
Stop and review rather than persist through the pain and develop bad habits .
7 . Stretch your extended arm and turn your body ( not just head ) to breathe .
Some triathletes will even turn almost to their backs and face skyward to avoid short gasps and oxygen debt ( tip from Dave Scott , 6 - time Ironman world champion ) .

8. Experiment with hand swapping as a drill :
It ’s difficult to remember all of the mechanical details while swimming .
I short - circuited trying to follow half a dozen rules at once .
The single drill that forced me to do most other things correctly is described on pg. 91- 92 of the TI book : hand swapping .
Coach Laughlin ’s observations of the Russian Olympic team practice were a revelation to me .
This is the visualization I found most useful : focus on keeping your lead arm fully extended until your other arm comes over and penetrates the water around the extended arm ’s forearm .
This encourages you to swim on your sides , extends your stroke length , and forces you to engage in what is referred to as “ front quadrant ” swimming .
All good things .
This one exercise cut an additional 3 - 4 strokes off each lap of freestyle .
Gear and Getting Started
Ready to give it a shot ?
If you have a phobia of swimming or just want to feel the difference a few counter - intuitive techniques make , here are some starter tips :
1. Gents , do n’t swim in board shorts .
I tried this in Brazil and did n’t realize it ’s like swimming with a parachute behind you .
Terrible .
Get some Euro - style Speedos and streamline .
Be cool on the beach and opt for efficiency in the water .
2 . Get good goggles .
I am now using Speedo Vanquisher goggles , which I find effective if you use a latex swim cap to keep the straps in place .
I need to tighten the nose bridge straps every 100 - 125 meters or so to prevent chlorinated water from blinding me , and leakage with all three goggles I tested seem to be due to eye pieces spread too far apart .
I ’ll be experimenting with the much - acclaimed Aqua Sphere Kaiman swim goggles , which are simple to adjust and tighten without removing them from your head .
3 . Start practicing in a pool that is short and shallow .
Use a lane in the shallow end ( 4 ft. or less ) and opt for a pool that is no longer than 20 yards .
I ’ve since progressed to 25 yards but found focusing on technique easier with shorter pools .
Since I ’ve adapted to 25 yards , I plan to move to an Olympic - sized 50 - meter pool once I can do 10 x 100 yards with 30 - 45 seconds of rest between sets .
To Finish Up …
I never ever thought I ’d say this but : I love swimming .
This is RIDICULOUS , as I have always HATED swimming and avoided it .
Now — after one book and DVD — I make time whenever possible to do laps like moving meditation .
I ’ll swim for two hours and sneak out to get in an extra session a few hours later .
I still ca n’t believe it .
I encourage all of you — whether you want to overcome your fears or win the Ironman — to give TI training a test drive .
It ’s the first instruction that ’s made sense to me and is 100 % responsible for the fastest transformative experience I ’ve ever had in the world of sports .
Just incredible .
Now , if I can just get from 100 - yard sets to 1 kilometer 🙂

Aug. 15 , 2008 -- Bisphenol A , the controversial plastic chemical , is safe at typical exposure levels from food and drink , according to an FDA draft report .
Bisphenol A , also called BPA , is found in polycarbonate plastic , including some water bottles and baby bottles , and in epoxy resins , which are used to line metal products including canned foods .
The draft report states that based on lab tests in rodents , infants and adults are exposed to bisphenol A levels that are below toxic levels .
" Safe or safety means that there is reasonable certainty in the minds of competent scientists that the substance is not harmful under the intended conditions of use , " but " complete certainty of absolute harmlessness is scientifically impossible to establish , " the draft report states .
Bisphenol A safety became a hot topic in April , when U.S. government scientists at the National Toxicology Program ( NTP ) expressed " some " concern about bisphenol A's possible effects on the mammary gland , prostate gland , and accelerated female puberty .
Since then , there 's been a storm of bisphenol A publicity , with major retailers including Wal - Mart backing away from baby bottles containing bisphenol A , the FDA probing bisphenol A safety , and consumers wondering how concerned they should be .
" It 's become a bit of a media spectacle , " says Sarah Vogel , PhD , MPH , whose Columbia University dissertation traces the politics , economics , and scientific history of bisphenol A .
That spectacle has n't let up .
Today 's FDA draft report , which does n't recommend banning bisphenol A , is the latest development .
But California lawmakers are debating a bill that would limit bisphenol A to trace amounts in products for kids age 3 and younger , and the NTP 's final report is expected this summer .
An FDA subcommittee will meet on Sept. 16 to discuss the FDA 's draft report on bisphenol A .
But will those reports settle the bisphenol A safety debate ?
Or have the questions lodged in the public consciousness , with opinion outpacing official guidance ?
And when all is said and done , will you ever look at your water bottles , baby bottles , and canned foods the same way ?
It depends whom you ask , with three very different viewpoints vying for your favor .
She stands in the empty room , a deplorable , terrible , pitiful sight .
Is it Margaret Hassan ?
Her family believe so , even though she is blindfolded .
I 'm not sure if videos like this should ever be seen – or perhaps the word is endured – but they are part of the dark history of Iraq , and staff of the Arab Al Jazeera satellite channel have grown used to watching some truly atrocious acts on their screens .
The " execution " – the cold - blooded , appalling murder of Margaret Hassan , the Care worker who was a friend as well as a contact of mine – is among the least terrible of the scenes that lie in the satellite channel 's archives .
Kidnapped by men in police uniforms , it is now November , 2004 , and Margaret has already made her last appeal .
Viewers saw her begging Tony Blair to help her , to withdraw British troops from southern Iraq .
" I beg of you to help me , " she says in a voice of great distress .
But there was then another tape which Al Jazeera refused to show , in which Margaret was coerced into claiming that she gave information to American officers at Baghdad airport .
A man 's voice prompts her to keep to a text .
" I admit that we worked with the occupation forces ... " she says .
It is untrue , of course .
Margaret was against the whole Anglo - American invasion .
She would never have spied on Iraqis .

Then comes the last tape .
She is standing in that bare room in a white blouse , a blindfold over her face , her head slightly bowed and a man approaches her from behind holding a pistol .
He points it at her head and places what appears to be an apple over the muzzle – a primitive form of silencer ?
And then squeezes the trigger .
There is a click , an apparent misfire , and the man retreats to the right of the screen and then reappears .
Margaret Hassan does n't move although she must have heard the click .
The man is wearing a grubby grey and black checked shirt and ill - fitting , baggy trousers , a scarf concealing his face .
This time the gun fires and the woman utters a tiny sound , a kind of cry , almost a squeal of shock , and falls backwards onto the floor .
The camera lingers on her .
She has fallen onto a plastic sheet .
And she just lies there .
There is no visible blood , nor wound .
It is over .
Should such terrible things be seen ?
Margaret 's immensely brave Iraqi husband told me I had his permission to watch this , but still I feel guilty .
I think it was only here , watching her death on a screen next to Al Jazeera 's studios more than three years later , that I realized Margaret Hassan was dead .
It was Margaret who took leukaemia medicines donated by readers of The Independent to the child cancer victims of Iraq back in 1998 after we discovered that hundreds of infants were dying in those areas where Western forces used depleted uranium munitions in the 1991 Gulf War .
She was a proverbial tower of strength , and it was she – and she alone – who managed to persuade Saddam Hussein 's bureaucrats to let us bring the medicine into Iraq .
The United Nations sanctions authorities had been our first hurdle , Saddam Hussein our second .
It is all history .
Like Margaret , all the children died .
" We 've trained ourselves not to go to the maximum in our feelings when we see terrible things like this , " Ayman Gaballah , Al Jazeera 's deputy chief editor , says bleakly .
And I can see why .
There are other tapes , other outrages too terrible to show .
George Bush wanted to bomb the station 's headquarters in Doha but staff have shown great sensitivity with what they show the world from Iraq .
There is no proof that any of Al Jazeera 's reporters was ever tipped off about anti-American attacks before they happened – in Iraq , I investigated these claims in 2003 and 2004 – but plenty of proof that some things are too awful to see .
On one tape , a half - naked man is held to the floor while another produces a small butcher 's knife and slowly carves his way through the victim 's throat , the poor man 's shriek of pain dying in froths of blood until his head is eventually torn from his body .
Another tape shows 18 Iraqi policemen held captive against a demand for the release of Iraqi women prisoners .
They are aged between 17 and 40 and stare at the camera hopelessly .
Al Jazeera aired the pictures and the written demands but then cut the next scene .
It shows the 18 men trussed up and blindfolded in front of a ditch .
A hooded man then fires into the back of one of their heads and – along with other men off - camera – goes from one body to the next , firing again and again .
Some of the victims are still alive , their legs kicking and the hooded man goes to each one and fires again into their heads .
Then , in the background , a bearded youth approaches the camera , holding an Islamic flag .
He is singing .
For some in the Al Jazeera studios these archives are intensely personal .
" I trained Ali Khatib – he was a great reporter , " I am told .
" The war was almost declared at an end in Iraq and he went out with our cameraman to cover some story and , while he 's approaching an American checkpoint , you can hear an American soldier on the tape say ' Stop – you have to go back ' .
And then the soldier just shot at them and killed both of them .
Ali had got married two weeks earlier . "
For some , the videotapes will always be too much .
When I met Margaret 's husband Tahseen in his Baghdad home after her murder , he was a picture of courage and mourning .
There were terrible times .
" I would come home and sit here and weep , " he told me then .
" I would sit here sometimes and go out of my mind crying and sobbing .
I do n't think insurgents did this .
I do n't think Iraqi people did this ...
I could n't see the video that was released – not because she 's my wife , but because I can't bear to see anyone assassinated . "
So who did murder Margaret Hassan ?
On the video of her apparent execution , there are no Islamic banners , no Muslim chants , no claim of responsibility , just the killer and the fatal shot .
After her kidnap , Margaret – who once worked as an English - language newsreader on Saddam 's government television station in Baghdad – even found support among the anti-American insurgents ; they issued a joint appeal for her release .
Even Abu Musab Zarqawi , the al - Qa'ida leader in Iraq who was later killed by the Americans , joined in the appeal .
Margaret had worked in Palestinian camps in the 1960s and fought tirelessly for those thousands of Iraqis under her care in Iraq .
If her husband 's suspicions were correct , then whose " foreign " hand took her away ?
The tape leaves no clue .
In Al Jazeera 's archives , it is difficult to escape this repository of death .
The Americans fired a cruise missile at Al Jazeera 's Kabul office in 2001 after it had forwarded Osama bin Laden 's tapes to Doha .
Then an American aircraft fired a missile at the station 's Baghdad office in 2003 .
That time , the Americans killed the bureau chief , Tareq Ayoub .
His jacket and his last notes are today on the wall of Al Jazeera 's Doha head office .
His staff had – for their own protection – earlier given the map coordinates of their Baghdad office to the US State Department .
Reporters asked Tony Blair – on a post - prime - ministerial tour of the Doha offices – if Bush had really planned to bomb them .
" Blair said something about ' the need to move on ' " one of them told me .
" So we knew it was true . "
If Al Jazeera 's staff have paid a terrible price for their reporting and have been the witnesses to some of the ghastlier acts in Iraq , they appear to have the ferocious support of the Emir of Qatar , Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al - Thani , who spends his millions funding the loss - making station .
Stories abound of the day that George Tenet – then America 's CIA chief – turned up in Qatar to give the Emir a dressing down for Al Jazeera 's reporting .
There was a stiff row between the two men before the Emir walked out .
In Washington , he was invited to meet Vice - President Dick Cheney , only to find that Mr Cheney had a thick file on his desk when he walked in .
It was Mr Cheney 's list of complaints against Al Jazeera .
The Emir told him he would not discuss it .
" Then that is the end of our meeting , " Mr Cheney announced .
" It is , " the Emir apparently replied .
And walked out .
The " meeting " had lasted 30 seconds .
But those are the high points , the drama of Al Jazeera .
The dark moments are on those terrible tapes .
I asked some of the reporters how humans could commit such atrocities .
None of them knew .
One suggested that 11 years of UN - imposed sanctions had somehow changed the mentality of Iraqis .
And I do recall , back in 1998 – when Saddam still ruled Baghdad – an NGO official tried to explain to me what was happening to Iraqis .
The Americans and British " want us to rebel against Saddam , " the official said .
" They think we will be so broken , so shattered by this suffering that we will do anything – even give our own lives – to get rid of Saddam .
The uprising against the Baath party failed in 1991 so now they are using cruder methods .
But they are wrong .
These people have been reduced to penury .
They live in shit .
And when you have no money and no food , you do n't worry about democracy or who your leaders are . "
That official was Margaret Hassan .
Pissed off this evening .

I once stood in John McCain 's kitchen and watched Cindy cook eggs for their kids .
It was still dark outside when I arrived at the McCains ' north - central Phoenix house on a winter day in early 1994 .
I remember terra cotta tile and overstuffed plaid couches and wondering whether Mrs. McCain regularly got up before dawn to make breakfast .
I was following her husband around for the day , for a story I was working on about his role in Arizona Republican politics .
I 'd been gathering examples of McCain 's strong - arming , and I needed some face - time with the senator , to ask about that and also to describe his personality .
That day , we drove to Tucson so McCain could sit in as guest host on a local talk - radio show .
VINTAGE McCAIN
Long before he landed on the national stage , John McCain was front and center in Arizona politics � and New Times was publishing stories about him .
For an in - depth look at McCain�s relationship with Charlie Keating , his continued favors from special interests , and the family history of his wife , Cindy , not to mention the history of her drug addiction , check out � Vintage McCain . �
For three hours , with the same piece of gum in his mouth , McCain took calls from listeners .
There was no set topic .
I got the anecdote I needed for my story in the form of a call from " Rosemary , " an obviously elderly woman who wanted to express her concern about nuclear proliferation .
" You make some excellent points , Rosemary , and I wish that everybody were as concerned about the issue as you are .
And I appreciate the call , " the senator told her .
Then he announced a station break , took off his headphones , and leaned over to me ( his BFF for the day ) with a Grinch - like grin on his face .
" I believe that Rosemary has a bumper sticker that says ' Visualize World Peace , ' " he said .
Vintage McCain .
A few months after that story was published , a good friend of mine who knows the senator well pointed out an error in my anecdote about John McCain and Rosemary .
In the story , I wrote :
Although his demeanor is even and cordial throughout the radio shift , his hands betray the storm that lurks beneath the surface .
His hands wring constantly , as if every bit of nervous energy , every distraction , every unspoken slam , is channeled through them .
" Uh , he does n't wring his hands because he 's mad , " my friend said .
" He does it because he 's in pain from the injuries he got as a prisoner of war .
His hands hurt constantly , so he rubs them together . "
It was a good lesson for a young reporter .
Never assume anything .
For years , I was embarrassed by the gaffe .
But looking back , I 've got to say that it 's pretty darn likely that handwringing was the product of McCain 's desire to control both pain and anger .
That 's the thing about covering John McCain .
Someone always wants you to give him the benefit of the doubt .
And there 's usually a pretty good case for why he deserves it , though that does n't mean he should be let off the hook completely .
Even now that McCain 's the one whining that Obama 's getting all the good press in this presidential race , you still do n't see a lot in the national media really damning the guy .
It could be that in this postmodern political world , there 's not much you can say anymore that will get the attention of the American people .
Ever since Monica Lewinsky crawled under that desk in the Oval Office , it 's been hard to shock this country .
Or it could be that , like me , no one really expected John McCain to make another run at the White House .
The man is old , and there 's no way his war injuries — far more extensive than cramped hands — do n't age him further .
I did n't think he'd be in the Senate in 2008 , let alone on practically every television screen , front page , and magazine cover .
If nothing else , that cameo in Wedding Crashers should have signified the end of McCain 's presidential aspirations .
And yet , here we are .
I 've been a writer and editor at New Times for 15 years .
For much of that time , I wrote about Arizona politics , which is to say that I wrote about John McCain .
It 's still odd to see the guy in the spotlight , because for quite a while , I was pretty much the only one covering him .
I never did fall for him in the way reporters fall for politicians , probably because he was n't much to fall for back in the early 1990s .
In those days , McCain was still rehabilitating the image he 'd later sell to the national media .
He was known then for cavorting in the Bahamas with Charlie Keating , rather than for fighting for campaign finance reform and limited government spending .
No one seems to remember Keating much , anymore .
Amazing .
McCain and his fellow Arizonan , Democrat Dennis DeConcini , were hauled before the Senate Ethics Committee along with three other senators to explain their actions on behalf of Keating 's Lincoln Savings and Loan .
Keating gave the senators hefty campaign contributions , then called on them to meet with bank regulators to pressure them to go soft on an investigation of Lincoln .
There were two infamous meetings .
McCain attended both .
It 's true that McCain was the first to back off when the appearance of impropriety became obvious , and the ethics committee was easier on him than most of the others , partly because some of McCain 's actions on behalf of Keating took place while he was in the House , and therefore not under the purview of the Senate Ethics Committee .
More important , what often gets lost in the retelling is McCain 's close personal relationship with Keating .
McCain took trips with Keating , including to his retreat in the Bahamas , and reimbursed him only after the fact was made public .
It was also revealed that Keating had a business relationship with Cindy and her father , Jim Hensley , who ran a very lucrative Anheuser - Busch distributorship in Phoenix .
Most shocking , perhaps , given McCain 's image today , is that McCain took more than $ 100,000 in campaign contributions from Keating and his employees , between 1982 and 1988 .
You may be surprised to know that in 1987 and 1988 , McCain voted against federal legislation reforming the campaign finance system .
It was only in 1990 , in the aftermath of Keating and the shadow of an upcoming re-election campaign , that he started supporting reform .
Ditto for his efforts to cut government spending .
And I 've got to pause to say something about both of those efforts .
In a word , they 're a farce .
McCain famously sponsored a law designed to control special interests ' grip on Washington , but at the same time , he took money from those interests .
Years ago , I analyzed McCain 's contributions , compared with the favors he dealt as chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee ( " An Endowed Chair , " November 25 , 1999 ) .
On top of that , McCain 's efforts have n't done much to reform the campaign finance system ; shady independent expenditures to outside groups supporting candidates now rule the day , in a roundabout way .
And millions are still spent on elections .
Efforts to stop pork - barreling are sadly cosmetic , as well .
First off , the earmarks that groups like Taxpayers for Common Sense rail against account for only 1 percent of the federal budget .
One percent .
And it 's not all bridges to nowhere .
McCain , who used to fight for projects like a regional airport for metropolitan Phoenix ( like minds argued whether building another airport was even necessary ; they wondered whether the airport idea was a ploy to antagonize certain Phoenix officials ) , now refuses to fund anything for the state .
And his sheep .
er , colleagues — Arizona congressmen John Shadegg and Jeff Flake — have followed suit .
As a result , Arizona ranked dead last in earmark funding in the past fiscal year .
Currently , East Valley Congressman Harry Mitchell , a freshman Democrat , is pushing for funding to continue a program at a Scottsdale hospital that trains doctors , nurses , and other military medical personnel in trauma care ; some have already used the training in Iraq and Afghanistan .
If that 's pork , I 'll take a BLT .
Arizona 's political forefathers —
Mo Udall , Barry Goldwater , Carl Hayden — pushed through one of the biggest pork barrel projects in the history of the United States Congress : the Central Arizona Project .
If they had n't , there would n't be much of a state to represent .
As a native Arizonan , those are the politicians I grew up learning about .
McCain just does n't compare .
Yeah , the guy has a sharp wit .
He 'd be fun to have beers with .
But does that mean he should have his finger on the button ?
I have my own share of war stories from covering McCain , like the time I stumbled across the news that Cindy was stealing prescription drugs from her own charity .
A few months later , John McCain berated a close family member of mine , in one of his classic outbursts .
For months after I wrote about McCain 's love affair with the national media , his chief of staff mailed me a copy every time another glowing piece about her boss came out in the press .
I learned the love lesson firsthand during the 2000 election , when — cajoled into doing an interview about McCain for a piece by TV newsmagazine 20/20 — I flew back and forth to Washington in a single day to be interviewed by Sam Donaldson , only to learn later from his producers that , whoops , Donaldson had decided he really liked McCain and did n't want to include anything negative in his profile .
On my way back to the airport that day , exhausted , I checked my voicemail from the back of a town car .
Tucker Carlson , then a writer for now - defunct Talk magazine , had called , looking for quotes for a story .
I called him back and left a message saying I could n't help him .
And since then , for the most part , I 've stayed away from other reporters doing stories about John McCain .
They still call , from as far away as London .
One guy , describing himself as a Phoenix freelancer ( I 'd never heard of him ) wanted to know what it would take to get me to give him all my files of public documents on Cindy McCain .
I tell them that the work my colleagues and I have done on McCain over the years speaks for itself .
And it does .
Yet , something seems to be getting lost in translation .
Much has been made of what McCain learned during his time in Vietnam and his time in Washington .
But there 's also something to be said about what Arizona has learned about John McCain from his time in — or , at least , his time representing — this state .
Here 's a story I 've never seen told .
In 1988 , Arizona was already down and out , politically — and John McCain could n't resist delivering a low blow .
When I was in the Phoenix Public Library just last month , looking for the old Congressional hearing testimony to confirm the story , I was surprised when the librarian knew just what I was talking about .
People here remember .
First , some background .
In the spring of 1988 , things were a mess .
Governor Evan Mecham had just been impeached , and everyone was busy licking wounds .
There was no way of knowing then that Arizona 's ugly days would turn into years — that the state stood to endure a political scandal that would send legislators to jail for taking bags of cash from undercover agents pretending to be lobbyists ( AzScam ) ; that its U.S. senators would become poster boys for corruption on the federal level ( the Keating Five ) ; or that its governor would leave office in disgrace over his personal financial dealings , narrowly avoiding a prison term ( John McCain 's pal J. Fife Symington III ) .
But before all that , there was Ev Mecham .
From a public relations standpoint , Mecham probably did more damage to the state than anyone , which is really saying something .
Mecham 's the conservative used - car dealer who — against all odds and against the GOP candidate anointed by everyone in the party , from John McCain on down — won the 1986 gubernatorial election .
Looking back , you can argue about just how bad a governor Mecham was .
Mostly he was an embarrassment .
He 's the one who used the term pickaninny and kept the state from recognizing the birthday of Martin Luther King Jr. as a national holiday , leaving Arizona 's tourism industry for dead .
Even Doonesbury took note in a series of comic strips .
People were so set on getting Mecham out of office that they launched simultaneous efforts .
To be on the safe side , in case the state Senate did n't impeach , the governor 's detractors started a recall movement .
The campaign was ready to go when Mecham was ousted .
But when it was clear that the recall was n't necessary , some insisted on continuing it .
In Arizona , when a governor leaves office early , the secretary of state ascends .
In this case , that was Rose Mofford , an old - school Democrat from the small mining town of Globe , a lady with a bright white beehive that Arizona Republic cartoonist Steve Benson once famously drew as a cone - full of Dairy Queen .
Mofford had served as secretary of state for decades .
She 'd never aspired to the state 's top spot .
But she accepted graciously and agreed to serve out the remaining 2 1/2 years of Mecham 's term .
She never showed interest in running for another term after that , although she was enormously popular .
As the story goes , John McCain and his friends wanted her out immediately .
And , they figured , they had the mechanism in place to do it .
Mecham was gone , but the recall effort was still in place .
Why not shift gears and target Mofford instead ?
The Democrats did n't like that one bit and asked the Arizona Supreme Court to consider the legality .
In mid-April 1988 , Mofford and some staff flew to Washington for , as one former aide puts it , the " perfunctory wet kiss " meeting with the Arizona congressional delegation .
Even in mean old D.C. , there 's such a thing as protocol , and the tour was expected to go along without incident .
At 10 in the morning on April 12 , Mofford testified before the Senate Energy and Water Development Subcommittee on Appropriations on the topic of the Central Arizona Project .
Now , Mofford had been governor for only eight days .
Before that , her main task had been running the state 's elections department .
This appearance ( there was a similar one , later that day , before the House ) had been billed as ceremonial .
She was not familiar with the particulars of federal water law .
Nor did her staff think she'd be expected to be — just then .
But , apparently , Senator James McClure , a Republican from Idaho , did .
After a lot of looking , that librarian and I ( actually , it took three librarians ) tracked down the testimony from that day .
McClure asked Mofford a series of questions that would leave any water expert 's mouth dry .
Her staff jumped in to try to answer , but even so , ultimately they had to file an addendum to the testimony .
Word spread quickly about what had happened .
Coincidentally , that very same day , Pat Murphy , then publisher of the Arizona Republic , was also in Washington to meet with the delegation .
He and his wife had lunch plans with McCain , and as Murphy recalls , they went to the hearing room where Mofford was testifying , to meet up with him .
Murphy had written glowingly of McCain and considered him a personal friend .
As Murphy recounted in an e-mail recently ( he left the Republic many years ago , and now lives in Idaho ) , the incident crushed him .
He says it was the beginning of the end of his respect for and friendship with McCain .
" We peeked in the room , " wrote Murphy .
" McCain saw us , excused himself , and we three went to the Senate dining room for lunch .
" During lunch , McCain said , almost with mischievous glee , that he had slipped some highly technical questions to [ James McClure ] to ask Mofford — questions she would n't be prepared to answer or expected to answer .
" Flabbergasted , I asked McCain why would he want to sabotage Mofford 's testimony , when in fact the CAP was the nonpartisan pet of Republicans and Democrats — such as far - left Udall and far - right Goldwater — since its inception .
" His reply , as near as I remember , was , ' I 'll embarrass a Democrat any time I get the chance . '
" The lunch continued in strained chit - chat .
We then walked back to McCain 's office , where a few reporters , all of them from Arizona papers , as I recall , were waiting .
One said there was a rumor McCain had tried to sabotage Mofford 's testimony , to which he said something like , ' I 'd never do anything like that . ' "
There was more .
Another rumor , later reported in the Republic , held that McCain had brought in a private film crew to tape the proceedings , so that the tape could be used to embarrass Mofford in the recall election .
At the time , Jay Smith , McCain 's campaign media consultant , was quoted in the Republic as declining comment ; he did not deny the rumor .
The next day , the Republic ran a story about Mofford 's trip to Washington .
There was another story that very same day about the Arizona Supreme Court 's decision not to allow the recall election to go forward .
John Rhodes , the former congressman who had been tapped to run against Mofford , sounded relieved .
He and Mofford were old friends .
Mofford , who lives in Phoenix and is involved with local charities , is hesitant to say much negative .
" I 've known Cindy since she was a little girl , and the Hensleys have always been very good to me , " she says of McCain 's wife and her family .
" I do n't hold grudges . "
But , she adds , regarding the CAP hearing , " that hurt me more than anything . . . to be set up like that . "
Others were upset , as well .
Karen Scates was on that trip and in that hearing room , as an executive assistant to Mofford .
( A one - time Udall aide , she 's worked in many capacities over the years , including for American Express and Kids Voting ; she 's now in the Napolitano administration . )
Scates does hold a grudge .
" Senator McCain did the unthinkable , " she says .
" He orchestrated a partisan , mean - spirited , and utterly inexcusable hearing designed to embarrass Governor Mofford by unfairly pressing her , only a week into her new job , for minute details on the Central Arizona Project , which was the most sacrosanct of all issues critical to Arizona . "
James McClure is now retired .
It 's been 20 years , but , when reached by phone , he remembered the incident immediately — though he was n't sure of all the particulars .
He says he recalls the hearing because it was unusual in that there was a strategy session beforehand .
" I know that there was such an effort , " the former senator says of the decision to ask Mofford tough questions .
" I know that there was quite a little conversation with my staff . . .
I know we did ask [ Mofford ] a number of questions because somebody had told us that she was not well grounded in some of the issues , and it was designed to expose her lack of information . "
As for McCain 's specific involvement ?
" I do n't remember his involvement in it , " McClure says .
" I 'm not saying he was n't , but I just do n't remember . "
Pat Murphy recalls hearing that McCain later called Mofford to apologize .
The former governor says no .
She got a different kind of call from McCain .
" He said , ' I did n't have anything to do with that . '
And I said , ' John , do n't ever call me again . ' "
Rose Mofford started off our phone conversation about John McCain by announcing : " He 's certainly no Barry Goldwater or Mo Udall . "
You hear that a lot around town these days , mainly because McCain tends to bring up Goldwater and Udall a lot on the campaign trail .
It drives some people here nuts .
Particularly those who know , or knew , all three men .
People who were around then say it was obvious that McCain moved to Arizona to run for office .
There have been several instances of such carpetbagging by now ( like Hillary Clinton in New York ) , but it was n't as common in 1982 .
To his credit , McCain worked hard and won a hotly contested four - way race to represent the congressional district that covered Mesa , Tempe , and other parts of the eastern portion of metropolitan Phoenix .
Then he had some catching up to do .
He did a lot of it , in the early days , with Mo Udall , the congressman from Tucson .
Udall liked to joke that he could hold meetings of the U.S. House Democrats from Arizona in his bathtub .
That might be why he worked so well with Republicans .
McCain took to him immediately and as Udall 's top aide , Bob Neuman , recalls , Udall was happy to help .
Neuman , who worked for Udall for many years in the 1970s and again in the ' 80s , says McCain " clung to Mo , " that he dropped by the office unannounced all the time .
This became awkward during the 1986 Senate race , Neuman says , when Arizona Democratic Party operatives worried that McCain was using Udall as a campaign tool .
They asked Neuman to put some distance between the two .
Udall 's aide tried to be subtle , but McCain got the message .
And Neuman felt his wrath .
He refuses to repeat the expletives the then - congressman used when he called to bawl him out , but recalls thinking there was something really wrong with the guy .
Neuman says he thinks McCain did try , early on , to model himself after Udall , in terms of developing both a sense of humor and a concern for environmental issues .
In the end , though , McCain has n't come out too Udall - esque on either front .
Udall 's humor tended toward self - deprecation .
During a rare break for a golf game during the 1976 presidential campaign , someone asked him about his handicap .
" I 'm a one - eyed Mormon Democrat from conservative Arizona , " he joked .
" You can't find a higher handicap than that . "
Neuman , who co-authored Udall 's book Too Funny to Be President and is now a consultant in Washington , concedes that Udall may not have found humor in McCain 's own repertoire of jokes .
One of the senator 's most famous :
Why is Chelsea Clinton so ugly ?
Because Janet Reno is her father .
Think that one was funny ?
How about one from 1986 , recounted in an entry last month on " The Huffington Post " blog .
McCain 's campaign denies it .
Apparently there 's no video , but a Tucson reporter who wrote about it at the time says it happened .
From Huffington :
In an appearance before the National League of Cities and Towns in Washington , D.C. , McCain supposedly asked the crowd if they had heard " the one about the woman who is attacked on the street by a gorilla , beaten senseless , raped repeatedly , and left to die ? "
The punch line : " When she finally regains consciousness and tries to speak , her doctor leans over to hear her sigh contently and to feebly ask , " Where is that marvelous ape ? "
" John McCain is the Eddie Haskell of politics , " Neuman says , admitting he 's a little worried McCain wo n't find that comment funny at all .
" You can attribute that to me , and he 'll kill me for it . "
McCain did vote with Udall on environmental issues — for a while .
But Udall left Congress in 1991 , and for years , McCain 's earned dismal marks from environmental groups , including a zero in the League of Conservation Voters ' most recent ratings .
Representatives of the local chapter of the Sierra Club have n't been able to get a meeting with him in at least the past year , if not two .
The last time they did , he just complained that the group 's positions were unrealistic , recalls Sandy Bahr , the chapter 's director .
McCain tends to support big - picture issues that will play well with voters , but when it has come to protecting Arizona over the past 26 years — well , not so much .
In the 1980s , McCain made a name for himself , supporting the limitation of air flights over the Grand Canyon , but in recent years , backed off the effort when environmentalists wanted to expand the limits from small tour planes to commercial aviation .
And he 's taken a lot of heat recently for refusing to weigh in on efforts to mine uranium near the Grand Canyon .
In fact , despite a vague statement issued last week saying he might , at some point , support mining reform , McCain has failed for years to back proposed changes to the horribly outdated Mining Act of 1872 — and evidence of that is strewn all over Arizona in the form of large strip mines and environmental degradation .
When it comes to Arizona environmental issues , though , McCain 's best known for an infamous U.S. Governmental Accountability Office report that details threats he made to the job of a forest service official who dared to disagree with him on the topic of the endangered Mount Graham red squirrel .
Not very Udall - esque .
Environmentalists were concerned that the University of Arizona 's plan to build telescopes would jeopardize the squirrels ' habitat .
Government scientists agreed .
McCain sided with the university .
And yet , the Udall comparison has stuck , mostly because McCain makes it whenever he can .
Even Newsweek , in an April cover story , noted the phenomenon , writing of McCain :
" He traces his environmental awareness to the sainted Rep . Mo Udall , an Arizona Democrat who took McCain as a young congressman under his tutelage . . .
To environmentalists , that 's like saying you learned about civil rights by driving around Alabama with Martin Luther King Jr . "
Arizona environmentalists do n't have a lot of patience with McCain , although they do celebrate the crumbs he 's handed them over the years .
Don Steuter , conservation chair for the Grand Canyon Chapter of the Sierra Club , is quick to recall that once , in the '90s , one of McCain 's aides came out and toured several mining sites along Pinto Creek in rural Arizona , all points of contention for environmentalists who worry about such issues as where the mines will get ground water to operate and where they 'll dump their waste .
" McCain was , I have to say , at the time , sympathetic with what we were trying to do .
But he never came forward and offered any solutions , " Steuter recalls .
It was Barry Goldwater , long out of public life and a couple of years from dying , who gave the Sierra Club a quote the group still uses in brochures : " Pinto Creek is worth the strongest protection possible . "
McCain also has been mentioning Goldwater a lot these days .
It 's true that the elder statesman chose McCain to run for his Senate seat , though some say McCain stepped over poor Bob Stump , the longtime Republican Arizona congressman who , via seniority , had the right of first refusal .
( Stump died in 2003 . )
Goldwater 's endorsement letter is reprinted in a new book by his son , Barry Goldwater Jr. , and John Dean .
And it 's not the only letter in Pure Goldwater about John McCain .
The book reports that for a while after the 1986 senate race , the men got along , but that Goldwater 's feelings toward McCain started to " cool " after the Keating scandal , and he " soon found he had to stop McCain from using his good name . "
Things really got ugly , according to the book — and accompanying letters — when McCain decided to throw an event honoring Goldwater that was really meant as a fundraiser for McCain .
Goldwater wrote to McCain , chastising him and telling him that he did n't wish to be honored .
He also instructed McCain to donate half the proceeds to the Arizona Republican Party .
The event wound up as a tribute to Ronald Reagan , instead .
Goldwater did speak there , but was unhappy afterward , as he wrote to McCain :
" You will recall during my speech at the dinner for the president in Phoenix , I announced that you were going to give half of the funds you raised to the State Republican Party .
I am told by the Party , that you still owe them $ 35,000 , and unless you pay all of it , or most of it , they cannot meet their payroll next Wednesday . "
McCain continues to bring up both men .
He does deserve credit for the time he spent with Udall during his final years .
" There was no steadier visitor , " Bob Neuman recalls of McCain 's visits to his old boss ' bedside during Udall 's very long struggle with Parkinson 's disease .
And for that , Neuman says , McCain earned his " respect and admiration and affection . "
Until McCain went public with it .
In 1997 , Michael Lewis profiled McCain for the New York Times Magazine .
Lewis ' piece was well - written , and he did get great access to McCain .
In fact , the senator even took the journalist to the veterans hospital in Washington , D.C. , for one of his visits with Udall .
According to Lewis , McCain tried in vain to wake Udall that day .
( Udall died the following year . )
About the encounter , Neuman says , " That was devastating to me , that he brought in a reporter .
I thought that was crossing the line , and it destroyed me . "
I 'm sure I would have accepted the offer to go the hospital , as well .
I can't blame Lewis , but maybe the sight of the legendary Mo Udall in his final , sad days was n't McCain 's to share .
One morning this summer , my work phone rang .
" Hi , Amy , this is Tom Gosinski , " a pleasant voice said .
" No way ! "
Every other call I 'd gotten about McCain , it seemed , had been from some reporter wanting to know where he or she could find Tom Gosinski , the guy who ultimately had led to the outing of Cindy McCain 's drug addiction in 1993 .
I had told people honestly that I had no idea where Gosinski was ; I had n't spoken to him in many years .
" It 's me ! "
" Okay , prove it , " I said .
" Tell me something that only Tom Gosinski would know . "
" I was wearing Pepe jeans the day I came to New Times , so you could interview me for the Cindy McCain story . "
It was him .
True , he could have read that detail in my story about him , but by then , I recognized the voice .
He 'd been on my mind .
Tom Gosinski's is a story worth re-telling , since it 's been parsed so much in the national press .
Sometime in the spring of 1994 , I 'd started hearing the rumors that Cindy McCain was addicted to prescription drugs .
Bummer for her , but not a story — at least not one that I 'd be able to get .
Then I learned something that turned Cindy McCain 's personal tragedy into a real news story .
Two unrelated sources told me about Tom Gosinski .
Gosinski was in his mid-30s , working two crappy part - time jobs to stay afloat .
He 'd been fired months earlier from his position as director of government and international affairs for the American Voluntary Medical Team , McCain 's non-profit charity , which brought medical relief to poor countries all over the world .
Turns out , shortly after he was fired , Gosinski went to the Drug Enforcement Administration .
He 'd suspected Cindy McCain was addicted to prescription drugs and was getting a doctor who worked with AVMT to illegally prescribe them in her employees ' names .
Later , in an interview with New Times , Gosinski said he was not trying to blackmail the McCains .
He was worried about his own culpability , so he asked the DEA officials a rhetorical question : " ' If a person knows that prescriptions have been written in their name , and they never met with the doctor and they do n't know the whereabouts of the drugs , what is their responsibility ? '
And I was told it was my responsibility to turn it in .
So at that moment , I began to cooperate with the DEA . "
Gosinski's suspicions were right .
Dr. John Max Johnson , AVMT 's medical director , had written two prescriptions for painkillers in Gosinski 's name , at Cindy McCain 's behest .
He 'd written more , too , in other people 's names .
Some prescriptions , the DEA found , were for as many as 500 pills at a time .
Johnson told investigators that he never traveled with the drugs ; Cindy McCain kept them in her personal luggage .
( Johnson later surrendered his medical license . )
Gosinski did n't just go to the DEA .
He also filed a wrongful - termination claim against AVMT , which led John McCain 's attorney , John Dowd ( well known for his over - the - top tactics on behalf of McCain and former Arizona Governor Fife Symington ) to persuade then - Maricopa County Attorney Rick Romley to open an extortion investigation against Gosinski ( it was eventually dropped ) .
If Dowd had stayed out of it , there 's a good chance this story would never have gone public .
I heard that the U.S. Attorney 's Office was investigating Cindy McCain , so I asked for the details .
Turns out , public - records law protects the feds ; there is no legal mandate to turn over materials related to an ongoing federal investigation .
But that law does not apply to Maricopa County .
So I asked the County Attorney 's Office for all materials related to the Gosinski extortion investigation , and hit the jackpot : Because Cindy 's drug problem was the topic of Dowd 's extortion case , the county attorney had received copies of all of the federal records related to the case .
I made a public - records request .
I got notice that the records were ready .
First , though , someone had told the McCains .
And so before my piece was even written , I watched their carefully spun version splash across more than one front page and lead at least one morning news show .
Cindy McCain talked openly about her drug addiction ( although the details of just when John had learned about it and about when she 'd gone through rehab remained unclear ) and attributed it to the pain of two back surgeries and stress from the Keating Five scandal .
The McCains claimed Gosinski was trying to blackmail them .
Later , we did our own story at New Times ( " Opiate for the Mrs. , " September 8 , 1994 ) .
Gosinski went on the record , and I also got hold of the journal he'd kept during the time he worked at AVMT .
Although he took a beating in the affair , the journal revealed how conflicted he was over her improprieties .
For example :
" July 27 , 1992 : I have always wondered why John McCain has done nothing to fix the problem .
He must either not see that a problem exists or does not choose to do anything about it .
It would seem that it would be in everyone 's best interest to come to terms with the situation .
And do whatever is necessary to fix it .
There is so much at risk : the welfare of the children ; John 's political career ; the integrity of Hensley & Company ; the welfare of Jim and Smitty Hensley ; and the health and happiness of Cindy McCain .
" The aforementioned matters are of great concern to those directly involved , but my main concern is the ability of AVMT to survive a major shake - up .
If the DEA were to ever conduct an audit of AVMT 's inventory , I am afraid of what the results might be . . .
It is because of CHM 's willingness to jeopardize the credibility of those that work for her that I truly worry .
" During my short tenure at AVMT , I have been surrounded by what on the surface appears to be the ultimate all - American family .
In reality , I am working for a very sad , lonely woman whose marriage of convenience to a U.S. Senator has driven her to : distance herself from friends ; cover feelings of despair with drugs ; and replace lonely moments with self - indulgences . "
Ultimately , the U.S. Attorney did , in fact , investigate AVMT and Cindy McCain .
In the end , she avoided criminal charges and entered a drug - diversion program .
She also paid for the cost of the investigation .
She was lucky ; if she were not well connected , she could have faced much harsher penalties , including prison time .
When I spoke to him this past June , Tom Gosinski said he 's doing well .
He left Arizona many years ago and took up a profession that has nothing to do with his previous work .
He does n't want to talk about the McCains .
( In fact , when I e-mailed him after our phone conversation , asking if he'd like to talk to me for this story , I never heard back . )
He called me because a private investigator had shown up on his mother 's doorstep that morning , looking for him , and they were spooked .
He wanted to know if I 'd heard of the guy , who did n't identify his political camp .
I had n't .
With a couple of exceptions , McCain never spoke to me again after the Gosinski story .
Word eventually trickled back ( years later ) that a few months after the story was published , he 'd cornered a close relative of mine in the Senate Dining Room in Washington , asking why my family could n't control me .
Given the treatment McCain has long received from the national media , it 's easy to see why he gets frustrated by any negative coverage .
At one point , an editor of mine had a brilliant idea : document the glowing coverage McCain was getting — even back then — from the national media .
That resulted in " The Pampered Politician " ( May 15 , 1997 ) .
For months after that story ran , Deb Gullett , one of McCain 's top staff , sent me a copy of each additional positive national story , as it came out .
I have to admit , that was pretty funny .
Better than the habit McCain 's Washington press staff had adopted when I 'd call — promising to be right back , then leaving me on hold until I finally hung up .
Even as the 2000 race heated up , coverage of McCain remained positive .
No one , it seemed , had a harsh word for the straight - talking war hero .
So when national media called , I felt an obligation to help .
I spent a lot of time working with producers for 60 Minutes to gather background research for a piece Mike Wallace was doing on McCain , only to have it deep - sixed when Wallace decided to do a positive story about the senator .
Ditto for Sam Donaldson .
I should have learned after Wallace that the press was willing to overlook political warts when it came to McCain , but since I 'd had a long conversation with Donaldson 's producers , in which I explained just what had happened with 60 Minutes , I did n't expect the same to happen with 20/20 .
From what I know , McCain did n't insert himself into the mix at 60 Minutes or 20 / 20 ; Wallace and Donaldson simply liked him .
But he has tried to do it elsewhere , particularly at his hometown daily , the Arizona Republic .
Back in the day , when McCain was first elected , he palled around with Duke Tully , the infamous Republic publisher who was ousted when it was revealed he 'd fabricated his own military record .
Next , McCain and aforementioned publisher Pat Murphy were buddies ; that relationship fizzled in the late 1980s .
As far as I know , McCain was never close with Chip Weil , who served as publisher , then CEO , at the Republic from 1991 to 2000 .
Weil ( officially , it 's Louis " Chip " Weil III ) is retired now .
He serves on the board of the USO .
In a phone conversation , he laughs , remembering his dealings with McCain , but it 's easy to tell he took them seriously , too .
" He always had his own views of how a newspaper ought to be run , and he did n't like the way we ran it , " Weil says of McCain .
" It 's a free world , so he 's welcome to feel that way . "
When poked , Weil admits the criticism was n't always welcome or , in his view , appropriate .
He confirmed the story going around locally that when McCain called , Weil 's secretary would sometimes put the phone receiver down and let the senator rant .
" We used to sit in the outer office and listen to him , " Weil says , laughing .
Becoming more serious , he continues , " The question was , ' Who [ was ] running the newspaper ? ' "
Weil says he did n't mind criticism but felt McCain was unreasonable in his requests .
The senator called Weil after a trip abroad to complain that the story about his travels was on page 14 , instead of the front page .
This was a time when McCain did n't even have serious opposition .
" Others were much more discreet about it .
For instance , Jon Kyl , if he had an issue , would call and discuss it , and it would be fine , " he says of Arizona 's junior senator .
" But McCain always seemed upset . "
During the 2000 presidential campaign , Weil says , McCain traveled around the country , complaining about the Republic .
" He 'd tell editorial boards how awful his hometown paper was , " Weil recalls .
" So I 'd hear from my colleagues around the country .
That was always fun . "
Would n't that be a badge of honor to good journalists ?
" I do n't know , " he says .
" He 's a United States senator , and you ought to have respect for a United States senator . "
On the first Tuesday in February , fortified with a cocktail or two , a few of us from New Times attended John McCain 's victory party at the Arizona Biltmore .
We had no particular agenda , no immediate deadlines , though there was some talk about watching history being made .
After all , Super Tuesday was going to put McCain over the top , making him the presumptive Republican nominee for president .
The huge ballroom was packed .
It felt like every Republican in town was there .
But not in a good way .
I know people like to joke that Cindy McCain looks like a Stepford Wife , but really , she 's got nothing on the group that night in the Biltmore 's largest ballroom .
Everywhere you looked , there were well - coiffed zombies , all dutifully mingling .
And sneaking peeks at their watches .
A few of the people we chatted up — Congressman Jeff Flake , Tempe Mayor Hugh Hallman , former Maricopa County Attorney Rick Romley — did seem genuinely excited , but just about all the others were clearly there because they had to be .
Maybe everyone was tired from a long workday .
But it seemed that , really , they were all profoundly bored and spending a lot of time looking around to make sure someone important from the McCain campaign noted their presence ( just in case the Arizona senator wins , and a job opens up in D.C. ) .
From that night on , it has been difficult to find anyone who'll say an unkind word about McCain .
Some did , obviously , for this story , but I know there are more .
Often , people would n't call back at all .
Although he has plenty of harsh comments for McCain in his book , Barry Goldwater Jr. never could be reached for comment .
Some I tried to talk to were apologetic about not being able to spill .
They work for ASU or the governor or a conservative think tank or a liberal think tank or they lobby Congress .
Or , like John Hinz , the one - time executive director of the Arizona Republican Party , who recounted some tales of the senator 's temper for the Washington Post this spring , they 've gotten the message that it's not a good idea to say anything negative about McCain .
It 's hard to keep track of the shifting alliances .
Paul Johnson , former mayor of Phoenix , who spent much of the early 1990s publicly loathing the senator , is now a Democrat for McCain .
But lobbyist Knox Kimberly , who once ran McCain 's local congressional office , is a big Barack Obama supporter .
Grant Woods , McCain 's first chief of staff , was very close friends with McCain , until a public falling out in the early '90s , when the senator shunned him for investigating his pal , Fife Symington .
Now Woods is back in the McCain camp .
He was at the Biltmore on election night .
I saw him from across the room .
He did n't return my call for this story .
Nor did anybody representing McCain get back to me after I contacted his campaign for this article .
Maybe some of the dreariness of the Biltmore event could be blamed on the large area roped off for the national press — a group of sad - looking , credentialed folks who could clearly suck the life out of any room .
Tucker Carlson stood watching the action , arms crossed , looking like he'd rather be anywhere else .
Postmodern McCain is just not as much fun as his predecessor , the straight - ahead , shit - talking bad guy .
Watching him up on the stage , struggling with the teleprompter , Cindy looking miserable next to him , I almost pitied the GOP 's presumptive nominee .
No more nasty jokes , no public outbursts .
He 's reduced to talking about climate change and accusing Obama of being the media 's flavor of the day .
" Do n't feel sorry for him , " a friend said .
" The guy might wind up president . "
Should we sue OPEC for anti-trust violations ?:
Sue OPEC , by Thomas W. Evans , Commentary , NY Times :
The president of the United States has the power to attack , and perhaps destroy , the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries , the illegal cartel that has driven the price of oil over $ 130 per barrel .
...
The president need simply allow the states to seek relief in the Supreme Court under our antitrust laws .
The oil ministers of the OPEC countries meet periodically to set production quotas ... and in the process establish an artificially high price for crude oil .
Under our antitrust laws , this is illegal .
Two years ago , Amy Myers Jaffe , an energy expert at Rice University , estimated that the real production cost was $ 15 a barrel , at a time when the price was approaching $ 60 .
Recently , an OPEC spokesman said the price could be $ 70 a barrel — a little more than half the current price — if speculation and manipulation could be eliminated .
Despite this illegal conduct , ... “ under the current state of our federal laws the individual member states of OPEC are afforded immunity from suit brought for damage caused by their commercial activities when they act through OPEC . ” ...
Fortunately , there is another way to sue OPEC .
Even if actions by individual citizens fail , a seldom - used provision of Article III of the Constitution grants original jurisdiction to the Supreme Court over lawsuits brought by states against “ foreign states ” ...
The attorneys general of the various states should sue OPEC as ... a foreign state .
( A joint action by the attorneys general is the method the states used to collectively sue tobacco companies , Microsoft and health maintenance organizations . ) ...
If the states won the case , the court could recover substantial damages based on assets and commercial activities of OPEC member nations in the United States .
Still , even though the states are allowed to sue OPEC in the Supreme Court , they might not prevail .
There are significant separation of powers issues .
...
That ’s where the president ... comes in .
If the Supreme Court decided to defer to the policies of the political branches , the states could ask the president to issue a statement permitting the lawsuit to go forward ...
This pathway was established in a statute passed by Congress in the wake of Cuba ’s expropriation of American sugar interests .
...
Moreover , confronted with the likelihood of huge damages and restraint of its illegal conduct , OPEC , or some of its members , might seek a settlement establishing production goals that would provide a price closer to actual costs .
The probable reduction in the price of heating fuel and gas at the pump might exceed the amount of the current federal stimulus package .
If the president allowed the states to sue OPEC , his actions would undoubtedly anger political leaders in the Middle East and create the need for diplomatic initiatives to limit the fallout .
But how stable is the Middle East right now ?
And is n’t starting a lawsuit better than starting a war ?
And , from the LA Times , Sue OPEC ( same title , but different authors , different editorial pages ) :
As the national average price of gasoline raced toward $ 4 a gallon and airlines laid off workers by the thousands because of rising jet fuel costs , the House of Representatives took action :
It overwhelmingly passed the Gas Price Relief for Consumers Act of 2008 .
The bill would have ... permitted the U.S. Justice Department to charge the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries with violating American antitrust laws .
Even before the 324 - 84
House vote last month , President Bush pledged a veto , saying OPEC might retaliate against U.S. interests overseas or cut oil production further .
But he did n't have to make good on that promise .
Senate Republicans held the line for him , last week threatening a filibuster ...
That effectively killed the bill and , for now , any hope that the United States would finally start treating oil the same way it does computer chips , vitamins , rubber and all other products .
...
If monopoly power is distorting these markets , then sure , we should fix that just as we should fix other market failures ( e.g. not fully internalizing environmental costs into production decisions ) .
However , it 's unlikely that this is the factor behind the run-up in prices .
Monopoly power explains the level of prices , i.e. why price is $ 8 rather than $ 5 , but it does n't explain the change in prices , i.e. why the price would change from $ 8 to $ 12 .
There are ways to tell this story , e.g. a war or some other event giving a cartel the cover it needs to raise prices and blame it on external factors , but I do n't think that 's what 's going on in oil markets today , at least I do n't think this is a significant factor behind the oil price increases .
For these reasons , if we fix the monopoly power problem , it 's unlikely that oil prices will suddenly plummet .
Even if monopoly power is a factor , it 's unlikely it 's as important as the growth in world demand .
And while I do n't put a lot of faith in the speculation story , I 'd be more likely to believe speculation was the cause of the price run up than I would monopoly power .
I do n't mean to downplay monopoly power , I 've been frustrated that we seem to have lost focus on this aspect of markets over the last few decades , and we do n't worry enough about market power in public policy .
And maybe breaking up OPEC would bring down the price noticeably ( for now , world growth will continue to put upward pressure on oil prices ) .
If so , then we should eliminate the monopoly power , there 's no reason to pay more than is necessary ( though if we impose carbon taxes to correct other problems in these markets , the price will go back up again , the difference will be who gets the extra revenue ) .
But I 'd also hate to see the oil price discussion get diverted by false hopes .
Breaking up OPEC might bring prices down some , but it wo n't bring back the good old days and the longer term problems remain .
At some point we have to face that things are changing , that we have to adjust - we can't keep hoping for a return of the low oil prices of the past because those days are n't coming back ( no matter how many holes we drill in Alaska or off our coasts ) .
Maybe technology will save us , but that too will require that we face reality and devote the resources and effort needed to fully investigate and develop alternative energy sources .
What it takes to be great
Research now shows that the lack of natural talent is irrelevant to great success .
The secret ?
Painful and demanding practice and hard work
( Fortune Magazine ) -- What makes Tiger Woods great ?
What made Berkshire Hathaway ( Charts ) Chairman Warren Buffett the world 's premier investor ?
We think we know : Each was a natural who came into the world with a gift for doing exactly what he ended up doing .
As Buffett told Fortune not long ago , he was " wired at birth to allocate capital . "
It 's a one - in - a - million thing .
You 've got it - or you do n't .
Well , folks , it 's not so simple .
For one thing , you do not possess a natural gift for a certain job , because targeted natural gifts do n't exist .
( Sorry , Warren . )
You are not a born CEO or investor or chess grandmaster .
You will achieve greatness only through an enormous amount of hard work over many years .
And not just any hard work , but work of a particular type that 's demanding and painful .
Buffett , for instance , is famed for his discipline and the hours he spends studying financial statements of potential investment targets .
The good news is that your lack of a natural gift is irrelevant - talent has little or nothing to do with greatness .
You can make yourself into any number of things , and you can even make yourself great .
Scientific experts are producing remarkably consistent findings across a wide array of fields .
Understand that talent does n't mean intelligence , motivation or personality traits .
It 's an innate ability to do some specific activity especially well .
British - based researchers Michael J. Howe , Jane W. Davidson and John A. Sluboda conclude in an extensive study , " The evidence we have surveyed ... does not support the [ notion that ] excelling is a consequence of possessing innate gifts . "
To see how the researchers could reach such a conclusion , consider the problem they were trying to solve .
In virtually every field of endeavor , most people learn quickly at first , then more slowly and then stop developing completely .
Yet a few do improve for years and even decades , and go on to greatness .
The irresistible question - the " fundamental challenge " for researchers in this field , says the most prominent of them , professor K. Anders Ericsson of Florida State University - is , Why ?
How are certain people able to go on improving ?
The answers begin with consistent observations about great performers in many fields .
Scientists worldwide have conducted scores of studies since the 1993 publication of a landmark paper by Ericsson and two colleagues , many focusing on sports , music and chess , in which performance is relatively easy to measure and plot over time .
But plenty of additional studies have also examined other fields , including business .
No substitute for hard work
The first major conclusion is that nobody is great without work .
It 's nice to believe that if you find the field where you 're naturally gifted , you 'll be great from day one , but it does n't happen .
There 's no evidence of high - level performance without experience or practice .
Reinforcing that no - free - lunch finding is vast evidence that even the most accomplished people need around ten years of hard work before becoming world - class , a pattern so well established researchers call it the ten - year rule .
What about Bobby Fischer , who became a chess grandmaster at 16 ?
Turns out the rule holds :
He 'd had nine years of intensive study .
And as John Horn of the University of Southern California and Hiromi Masunaga of California State University observe , " The ten - year rule represents a very rough estimate , and most researchers regard it as a minimum , not an average . "
In many fields ( music , literature ) elite performers need 20 or 30 years ' experience before hitting their zenith .
So greatness is n't handed to anyone ; it requires a lot of hard work .
Yet that is n't enough , since many people work hard for decades without approaching greatness or even getting significantly better .
What 's missing ?
Practice makes perfect
The best people in any field are those who devote the most hours to what the researchers call " deliberate practice . "
It 's activity that 's explicitly intended to improve performance , that reaches for objectives just beyond one 's level of competence , provides feedback on results and involves high levels of repetition .
For example : Simply hitting a bucket of balls is not deliberate practice , which is why most golfers do n't get better .
Hitting an eight - iron 300 times with a goal of leaving the ball within 20 feet of the pin 80 percent of the time , continually observing results and making appropriate adjustments , and doing that for hours every day - that 's deliberate practice .
Consistency is crucial .
As Ericsson notes , " Elite performers in many diverse domains have been found to practice , on the average , roughly the same amount every day , including weekends . "
Evidence crosses a remarkable range of fields .
In a study of 20 - year - old violinists by Ericsson and colleagues , the best group ( judged by conservatory teachers ) averaged 10,000 hours of deliberate practice over their lives ; the next - best averaged 7,500 hours ; and the next , 5,000 .
It 's the same story in surgery , insurance sales , and virtually every sport .
More deliberate practice equals better performance .
Tons of it equals great performance .
The skeptics
Not all researchers are totally onboard with the myth - of - talent hypothesis , though their objections go to its edges rather than its center .
For one thing , there are the intangibles .
Two athletes might work equally hard , but what explains the ability of New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady to perform at a higher level in the last two minutes of a game ?
Researchers also note , for example , child prodigies who could speak , read or play music at an unusually early age .
But on investigation those cases generally include highly involved parents .
And many prodigies do not go on to greatness in their early field , while great performers include many who showed no special early aptitude .
Certainly some important traits are partly inherited , such as physical size and particular measures of intelligence , but those influence what a person does n't do more than what he does ; a five - footer will never be an NFL lineman , and a seven - footer will never be an Olympic gymnast .
Even those restrictions are less severe than you 'd expect : Ericsson notes , " Some international chess masters have IQs in the 90s . "
The more research that 's done , the more solid the deliberate - practice model becomes .
Real - world examples
All this scholarly research is simply evidence for what great performers have been showing us for years .
To take a handful of examples : Winston Churchill , one of the 20th century 's greatest orators , practiced his speeches compulsively .
Vladimir Horowitz supposedly said , " If I do n't practice for a day , I know it .
If I do n't practice for two days , my wife knows it .
If I do n't practice for three days , the world knows it . "
He was certainly a demon practicer , but the same quote has been attributed to world - class musicians like Ignace Paderewski and Luciano Pavarotti .
Many great athletes are legendary for the brutal discipline of their practice routines .
In basketball , Michael Jordan practiced intensely beyond the already punishing team practices .
( Had Jordan possessed some mammoth natural gift specifically for basketball , it seems unlikely he'd have been cut from his high school team . )
In football , all - time - great receiver Jerry Rice - passed up by 15 teams because they considered him too slow - practiced so hard that other players would get sick trying to keep up .
Tiger Woods is a textbook example of what the research shows .
Because his father introduced him to golf at an extremely early age - 18 months - and encouraged him to practice intensively , Woods had racked up at least 15 years of practice by the time he became the youngest - ever winner of the U.S. Amateur Championship , at age 18 .
Also in line with the findings , he has never stopped trying to improve , devoting many hours a day to conditioning and practice , even remaking his swing twice because that 's what it took to get even better .
The business side
The evidence , scientific as well as anecdotal , seems overwhelmingly in favor of deliberate practice as the source of great performance .
Just one problem :
How do you practice business ?
Many elements of business , in fact , are directly practicable .
Presenting , negotiating , delivering evaluations , deciphering financial statements - you can practice them all .
Still , they are n't the essence of great managerial performance .
That requires making judgments and decisions with imperfect information in an uncertain environment , interacting with people , seeking information - can you practice those things too ?
You can , though not in the way you would practice a Chopin etude .
Instead , it 's all about how you do what you 're already doing - you create the practice in your work , which requires a few critical changes .
The first is going at any task with a new goal : Instead of merely trying to get it done , you aim to get better at it .
Report writing involves finding information , analyzing it and presenting it - each an improvable skill .
Chairing a board meeting requires understanding the company 's strategy in the deepest way , forming a coherent view of coming market changes and setting a tone for the discussion .
Anything that anyone does at work , from the most basic task to the most exalted , is an improvable skill .
Adopting a new mindset
Armed with that mindset , people go at a job in a new way .
Research shows they process information more deeply and retain it longer .
They want more information on what they 're doing and seek other perspectives .
They adopt a longer - term point of view .
In the activity itself , the mindset persists .
You are n't just doing the job , you 're explicitly trying to get better at it in the larger sense .
Again , research shows that this difference in mental approach is vital .
For example , when amateur singers take a singing lesson , they experience it as fun , a release of tension .
But for professional singers , it 's the opposite :
They increase their concentration and focus on improving their performance during the lesson .
Same activity , different mindset .
Feedback is crucial , and getting it should be no problem in business .
Yet most people do n't seek it ; they just wait for it , half hoping it wo n't come .
Without it , as Goldman Sachs leadership - development chief Steve Kerr says , " it 's as if you 're bowling through a curtain that comes down to knee level .
If you do n't know how successful you are , two things happen :
One , you do n't get any better , and two , you stop caring . "
In some companies , like General Electric , frequent feedback is part of the culture .
If you are n't lucky enough to get that , seek it out .
Be the ball
Through the whole process , one of your goals is to build what the researchers call " mental models of your business " - pictures of how the elements fit together and influence one another .
The more you work on it , the larger your mental models will become and the better your performance will grow .
Andy Grove could keep a model of a whole world - changing technology industry in his head and adapt Intel ( Charts ) as needed .
Bill Gates , Microsoft's ( Charts ) founder , had the same knack :
He could see at the dawn of the PC that his goal of a computer on every desk was realistic and would create an unimaginably large market .
John D. Rockefeller , too , saw ahead when the world - changing new industry was oil .
Napoleon was perhaps the greatest ever .
He could not only hold all the elements of a vast battle in his mind but , more important , could also respond quickly when they shifted in unexpected ways .
That 's a lot to focus on for the benefits of deliberate practice - and worthless without one more requirement :
Do it regularly , not sporadically .
Why ?
For most people , work is hard enough without pushing even harder .
Those extra steps are so difficult and painful they almost never get done .
That 's the way it must be .
If great performance were easy , it would n't be rare .
Which leads to possibly the deepest question about greatness .
While experts understand an enormous amount about the behavior that produces great performance , they understand very little about where that behavior comes from .
The authors of one study conclude , " We still do not know which factors encourage individuals to engage in deliberate practice . "
Or as University of Michigan business school professor Noel Tichy puts it after 30 years of working with managers , " Some people are much more motivated than others , and that 's the existential question I cannot answer - why . "
The critical reality is that we are not hostage to some naturally granted level of talent .
We can make ourselves what we will .
Strangely , that idea is not popular .
People hate abandoning the notion that they would coast to fame and riches if they found their talent .
But that view is tragically constraining , because when they hit life 's inevitable bumps in the road , they conclude that they just are n't gifted and give up .
Maybe we can't expect most people to achieve greatness .
It 's just too demanding .
But the striking , liberating news is that greatness is n't reserved for a preordained few .
It is available to you and to everyone .

Still at Code Yellow , DHS fears 11 months of ' heightened alert ' David Edwards and Nick Juliano
Published : Monday July 28 , 2008
Print This Email This With 99 days until the presidential election , the Department of Homeland Security is raising vague concerns about possible terrorist attacks in the US or abroad .
ABC News ' Pierre Thomas says DHS officials are " quietly declaring " that the US is entering a " Period of Heightened Alert " because of the upcoming Olympics , the Democratic and Republican conventions , the November elections and the fact that a new president will be taking office in January .
Officials tell Thomas the next 11 months will be " a time frame when terrorists may have more incentive to attack . "
Accusations of politicization haunted DHS 's decision to move the nation 's color - coded advisory system from yellow , or elevated risk , to orange , or high risk , just three months before the 2004 election .
( A week after President Bush was re-elected , the agency returned the advisory back to yellow . )
This time around , DHS is n't changing colors , Thomas reports , because the " do not want to be accused of trying to inject themselves into the presidential campaign . "
Instead , apparently , anonymous officials are simply passing unspecific warnings to a correspondent for a national television network .
Government officials point to the Sept. 11 attacks , which happened just nine months into a new administration , and the Madrid train bombings , which were carried out just three days before Spain 's 2004 general election .
They say history suggests a need to take potential threats seriously -- especially in the very near future .
At the moment , though , there are " no specifics " indicating an imminent domestic attack .

Mr Yushchenko said only a collective security pact could protect Ukraine Ukraine has said it is ready to make its missile early warning systems available to European nations following Russia 's conflict with Georgia .
The foreign ministry said Moscow 's abrogation earlier this year of an accord involving two tracking stations allowed it to co-operate with others .
President Viktor Yushchenko said his country could ensure its sovereignty only through collective security .
Last week , Kiev limited the freedom of movement of Russia 's Black Sea Fleet .
The move came after several of the fleet 's warships , based at Sevastopol in Ukraine 's Crimea 's peninsula , were deployed along the Georgian coastline .
Moscow denounced the restrictions as anti-Russian and said its military commanders would answer only to the Russian president .
' Unprecedented situation '
In a statement , Ukraine 's foreign ministry said that because the country was no longer party to the 1992 agreement with Russia on the use of its radar stations , it could now " launch active co-operation with European nations " .
Only a collective security system will provide the highest international guarantees ... that could prevent any actions like those which occurred in ...
South Ossetia
President Viktor Yushchenko
This might include " the integration of Ukrainian elements of missile early warning and space control systems with those of foreign countries that are interested in gathering space data " , it said .
Earlier this week , President Yushchenko issued a decree putting an end to Ukraine 's participation in the accord in view of Russia 's abrogation of it .
He said the situation was unprecedented and showed that his country could only ensure its national sovereignty through collective security .
Only that , he said , " could prevent any actions like those which occurred on 7 - 8 August at first in South Ossetia , and then in other regions of Georgia " .
BBC diplomatic correspondent James Robbins says the decision is evidence Ukraine is now more desperate to embrace the West as its fear of Russia intensifies and Moscow seemingly becomes more determined to prevent any neighbouring states from joining Nato .
Russia clearly sees Nato as America 's sphere of influence , despite US President George W Bush 's insistence that it is a purely defensive alliance of sovereign democracies , our correspondent says .
Increasingly , the events of the past 10 days demonstrate Russia has gone back to arm - wrestling with its neighbours and the West after the immediate post - Soviet years , when it felt too weak , he adds .

( CNN ) -- A Louisiana man was sentenced to four months Friday for using hangman 's nooses to threaten and intimidate civil rights marchers near Jena , Louisiana , officials said Friday .
Jeremiah Munsen , 19 , pleaded guilty to federal hate crime charges for dangling nooses from the back of a pickup in September and driving past a group of protesters at a bus depot in Alexandria , Louisiana , about 35 miles south of Jena , where the marches took place .
The protesters , who were awaiting buses to return to Tennessee , had taken part in demonstrations over the " Jena Six " case , in which a white student was said to have been beaten by six black classmates in 2006 .
The protesters were criticizing local authorities who initially charged the six black students with second - degree attempted murder and conspiracy .
The charges were later reduced , and recently , a Louisiana appeals court removed the Lasalle Parish judge presiding over the cases .
Five of the teens are awaiting trial .
Another , Mychal Bell , reached a plea agreement on a battery charge in juvenile court .
Munsen , of Pineville , Louisiana , must also complete a year of supervised release and 125 hours of community service after his prison term .
He pleaded guilty in April and admitted that " he and the other person had previously discussed the Ku Klux Klan and how they thought the Klan would have responded to the rally in Jena , " the Department of Justice said in a statement Friday .
" The defendant used a threatening and offensive tactic to intimidate peaceful civil rights marchers who were in Louisiana to rally against racial intolerance , " said Grace Chung Becker , acting assistant attorney general .
" Our civil rights laws protect the civil rights of all Americans , and they emphasize the reality that we are all members of one particular race : the human race , " said Donald Washington , U.S. attorney for the western district of Louisiana .
Munsen faced a maximum sentence of a year in prison .

Love Canal 's Lethal Legacy Persists
New generation of children worry about cancer , birth defects , in their future .
Aug. 11 , 2008  -- Renee Retton carries the 1978 photo of her pregnant mother as a reminder of the baby sister who was never born .
The near - term infant was delivered stillborn four days after she died in utero -- just months after the family had evacuated from Love Canal , a Niagara Falls , N.Y. , neighborhood that sits atop 22,000 tons of toxic waste .
Like her sister " Julie Ann " and thousands of other children , Retton was conceived during the nation 's worst chemical disaster .
Her medical history is daunting : an arterial birth defect , deformed teeth , thyroid disease , pernicious anemia , attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and a string of auto - immune conditions .
And now , on the 30th anniversary of Love Canal , a preliminary New York State Department of Health study says women like Retton , whose mothers were pregnant and exposed to those chemicals , have double the risk for reproductive problems -- low birth weights , pre-term deliveries and birth defects .
They are also at higher risk for kidney , bladder and lung cancer , according to a not - yet - released study of the health effects at Love Canal .
There , in a seemingly idyllic subdivision of swales , fields and neat bungalows , children played as carcinogens like benzene and dioxin bubbled up from the earth below .
More than 6,000 residents were affected .
" It 's scary , " Retton told ABCNews.com , as she walked ankle - deep in the untended brush where her childhood home was demolished in the clean - up effort .
" I feel like a research animal , " said Retton , a redhead with cherubic features and waif - like limbs .
" I do n't think anything I have now compares to what I will get later .
It 's not if , it 's when . "
Family Fights Cancer
Retton 's 27 - year - old brother has just had a growth removed from his back .
Their father was recently diagnosed with stage - four cancer , and their mother has had several breast cancer scares .
The 30 - year - old manicurist said doctors told her they fear it might be " difficult " for her to carry a pregnancy to term .
Today , three decades after 900 families were evacuated , the children of Love Canal are coping with a lethal legacy that they say has spilled across generations : birth defects , cancers and auto - immune disorders .
The New York State Department of Health would not comment on any health problems facing these children , all now adults and of child - bearing age .
" Our study is not complete yet , " spokesperson Claire Posposil told ABCNews.com .
The Environmental Protection Agency calls Love Canal " one of the most appalling environmental tragedies in American history , " and many believe the site is still deadly .
Today a menacing chain - link fence surounds an eerily peaceful meadow .
No signage or visitor center points to its poisonous past .
Only the chemical monitors that poke out of the wildflowers and two humming treatment plants suggest what lurks below .
Retton likes to think of the fence as a metaphor -- " the bars of justice " -- and wonders why , if the land is so safe , it 's still off limits .
She has pledged to fight for other victims by studying to be a legal nurse .
" The grass is really green , " she said about the site .
" It 's a reminder of the goo underneath . "
The canal itself -- an unfinished project named for entrepreneur William Love , who tried to connect the upper and lower Niagara River -- was by the 1920s a dump site for the Hooker Chemical Company .
The company covered the canal and in 1953 sold it for one dollar to city officials .
The deed warned of the dangers and included a disclaimer against future liability .
An elementary school was built on the perimeter and by 1978 about 800 homes and 240 low - income apartments sprang up around it .
Deadly Brew Erupts
Residents say they were never told about the chemicals -- a brew so deadly it burned through its drums .
After the record blizzard of 1977 , melting snow raised the water table and toxins began erupting in residents ' backyards .
Their school was equally contaminated .
Children returned from recess in sludge - covered clothing with blackened burns on their hands .
They scoured the grounds for " hot rocks " that , when thrown against a hard playground , sparked and once reportedly caught a child 's pants on fire .
One spring after a heavy snow melt , a swimming pool literally popped up from the ground , surrounded by a " sea of chemicals , " according to the EPA , and the air had a " faint choking smell . "
Early surveys showed 56 percent of the children had a birth defect , and mothers had a 300 percent jump in miscarriages .
In one family , a girl was born deaf and with a cleft palate , an extra row of teeth and slight retardation .
Her brother had an eye defect .
Michelle Brown Skiba , a soft - spoken blond who works as a librarian at Niagara University , remembers playing in the " black muck " at Love Canal .
As a child , she developed rheumatoid arthritis and had a growth removed from her knee .
She also never developed her second teeth .
" All my friends had the same thing , " she told ABCNews.com .
Skiba says her mother had six miscarriages before the family left when she was 12 .
Both her parents died nine years ago -- two days apart -- one from cancer and the other from a diabetes - related heart condition that was diagnosed at Love Canal .
Now 42 and married , Skiba said she had decided never to have children .
" In the back of my mind , I did n't know what the future would bring . "
It was Lois Gibbs , then a young mother and president of the homeowners association , who took action .
She could n't understand why her two children had an array of illnesses : epilepsy , asthma and urinary tract infections .
Her neighbor lost a 5 - year - old to a kidney disease , and many others , like Retton 's and Skiba 's mothers , had miscarriages and stillbirths .
A newspaper article tipped her off to the presence of chemical waste and she organized a door - to - door campaign that brought national attention to the disaster .
Eventually , she founded the Center for Health and Environmental Justice ( CHEJ ) , where she now serves as executive director .
" There should be no more health studies , they 've only created anxiety and frustration , " said Gibbs , now 60 , who wants Love Canal to serve as a " living laboratory " to help clean up 1,400 other Superfund sites across the country .
In 2004 , the EPA removed Love Canal from its Superfund list , a list that was created in response to the Love Canal disaster .
" There is a misconception that it 's been cleaned up , but there 's still 20,000 tons of chemicals and no one has taken a single barrel out , " she told ABCNews.com .
" The waste that leaked into the soil is still there . "
The dump has been capped and two treatment plants were built to catch contaminants , but critics say another big storm could unearth the chemicals anew .
Psychological and Medical Limbo
While experts say there is no scientific proof that all of these ailments were caused by chemical exposure , the children of Love Canal say their lives have been thrown into psychological limbo .
At 13 , Michael Zimmerman remembers his parents ' " anger , frustration and worry " over the evacuation .
His sister had been born two months premature at Love Canal .
Now , 42 , and a senior master sergeant in the Air Force Reserve , he worries about his own two children , though seemingly healthy .
His 38 - year - old brother and father are fighting cancer .
" It 's always hanging over our heads , " Zimmerman , told ABCNews.com .
" I worry about when it 's going to happen to me , like a time bomb going off and the exposure is going to catch up to me . "
About 67 original Love Canal homeowners refused to leave in the 1970s and some of their homes are still standing .
George Kreutz , Amanda Bach and their three boys -- all under the age of 5 -- moved to just one foot from the edge of the contaminated zone .
Rent was cheap and they loved the small , clapboard house until a green , chalky residue appeared in the basement .
The couple had never heard of Love Canal and they can't afford to move .
" I 'd leave here in a heartbeat , " he told ABCNews.com , pointing to what he believes are toxic apples that tempt his toddlers .
" I ca n't take my eyes off my children . "
In the 1990s , the city " reclaimed " some of the boarded - up houses and declared the area outside the perimeter safe .
But in order to obtain mortgages , buyers had to sign waivers that they would not later sue .
David Bower , who was one of the first to buy a home from the city ( for $ 38,000 ) , pays little attention to the fenced wasteland just one street away .
" I 'll be honest , " the 42 - year - old detective told ABCNews.com outside his renovated ranch home .
" This is the most tested part of the country .
I know what 's in the soil . "
" It needs to go to rest , " he said of the efforts of the outspoken Love Canal children .
" I eat the vegetables in my garden and I 'm not glowing in the dark . "
But Stephen Lester , who was a toxologist and science adviser at Love Canal , says health studies are not telling the whole truth .
The New York study only measured birth outcomes after 1983 , and it only asked residents about reproductive health and certain specific cancers .
" In many ways this is a curse , " said Lester , now married to Gibbs and CHEJ 's science director .
" Because no one helped them to get straight answers , they are stuck with illnesses they think are connected to their exposure . "
As far as the EPA is concerned , the case is closed .
In 1995 , Occidental Petroleum , parent company to Hooker Chemical , agreed to pay $ 129 million in restitution .
Out of that federal lawsuit came money for a small health fund and $ 3.5 million for the state health study .
' Worse Than Vietnam '
But some say it was never enough .
" It was worse than Vietnam , " said one 60 - year - old veteran whose wife lost a baby and whose daughter carries birth defects .
Looters plundered his house as he continued to pay his mortgage and rent another home .
Today , he wages his own cancer battle and worries about speaking out , for fear of jeopardizing his job -- and his health insurance .
" There are thousands of people living with a monster in their lives that they cannot forgive or forget , " he told ABCNews.com , staring at the fallow field where his home once stood .
He blames everyone : city , state and federal government , as well as greedy builders and buyers .
" People turned their backs on us . "
Meanwhile , Renee Retton , begs her mother for details about the day she brought home a doll named " Julie Ann " and not a living sister .
" My mom wo n't talk about it and I am still grieving and trying to work it out and fight for those at Love Canal , " she said .
" But forgetting about her is like killing a part of myself . "

Barack Obama has at least seven reasons to be concerned about his chances in November .
7 worrisome signs for Obama
A few weeks back , Time magazine was musing that John McCain was in danger of sliding from “ a long shot ” to a “ no - shot . ”
Around the same time , a hard - nosed former Hillary Clinton insider declared the race “ effectively over ” thanks to the McCain campaign ’s ineptitude , the tanking U.S. economy and Obama ’s advantages in cash , charisma and hope .
And Obama , up by three to six points nationally , was about to leverage a much - anticipated trip to Iraq , Afghanistan and Europe into a pre-convention poll surge .
Instead , his supporters are now suffering a pre-Denver panic attack , watching as John McCain draws incrementally closer in state and national polls – with Rasmussen ’s most recent daily national tracker showing a statistical dead heat .

Meanwhile , Hillary Clinton has been privately enumerating her doubts about Obama to supporters , according to people who have spoken with her .
Clinton ’s pollster Mark Penn recently unveiled a PowerPoint presentation red-flagging Obama ’s lukewarm leads among white female voters and Hispanics – while predicting a five - point swing could turn a presumed Obama win into a McCain landslide .
“ It ’s not that people think McCain will win – it ’s that they are realizing that McCain could win , ” says Quinnipiac University pollster Peter Brown , whose surveys show tight races in Michigan , Ohio , Pennsylvania and Florida .
“ This election is about Barack Obama — not John McCain — it 's about whether Barack Obama passes muster .
Every poll shows that people want a Democratic president , the problem is they ’re not sure they want Barack Obama . ”
Obama ’s aides point to the stability of his small national lead , say they are n’t worried about his summer stall and think his numbers will improve when voters begin tuning in to the conventions .
“ This is a country that is looking for a fundamentally different direction , and John McCain offers nothing but the status quo , ” said spokesman Bill Burton , adding that he was n’t “ losing any sleep ” over Obama 's rough patch .
The campaign ’s confidence may turn out to be justified , but two weeks prior to the national convention there are more than a few worrisome signs for Obama .
Here are seven :
1. Race .
“ The idea that Obama was going to win in a blowout was always preposterous , ” says former Nebraska senator and onetime presidential hopeful Bob Kerrey , an Obama backer .
“ A big piece of this , of course , is whether white people are going to support a black guy .
... If [ Obama ] is a tall , skinny white guy named Paul Jones , it 's a different story . ”
Obama is running nearly neck - and - neck with McCain among white voters in most polls , a major cause for optimism considering that John Kerry lost the white vote by 17 points and that Al Gore lost it by 12 points .
Among whites , he does well with women , the affluent and college grads but fares poorly among low - income earners and Catholics — key swing groups that handed Hillary Rodham Clinton stunning blowouts in West Virginia and Kentucky .
How much does his race factor into tightening contests in Missouri , Wisconsin , Florida , Minnesota and Ohio ?
Nobody knows — and that ’s the problem .
A huge challenge for Obama , insiders say , is simply determining how much skin color will matter in November .
Race is nearly impossible to poll — no one ever says “ I ’m a racist ” — and no campaign wants it revealed they are even asking questions on the issue .
“ It ’s the uncertainty that kills me — we know it ’s going to be factor , but how big a factor ? ” asks a Democratic operative with ties to the Obama camp .
“ How do you even measure such a thing ?
Adding to the jitters : GOP surrogates like New York Rep. Peter King have vowed to make Obama ’s relationship with the Rev. Jeremiah Wright a centerpiece during the homestretch .
2. Obama ’s strength in Virginia may be overhyped .
His chances of ending the Democrats 44 - year losing streak in the commonwealth are pretty good — thanks to the explosive growth of the liberal D.C. suburbs , and a 147,000 spike in voter registration sure to benefit Democrats .
But Obama ’s aides privately concede his odds in Virginia are probably no better than 50 - 50 and that the state is far from a lock - solid hedge if he loses Ohio and Florida .
3. Michigan ’s in play for McCain .
In the year of the downturn , the hard - hit upper Midwest should be prime Obama country .
Instead it ’s a potential minefield .
Obama is still ahead by two to five points there — similar to margins of victory enjoyed by Gore and Kerry in the last two presidential contests — but McCain has quietly crept up over the past month and could vault ahead if he anoints ex-Gov.
Mitt Romney as his running mate .
Simmering tensions between predominantly black Detroit and its white suburbs could hurt Obama .
And McCain ’s surrogates were handed a gift in the jailing of Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick , an Obama supporter .
“ Watch Michigan — the Democrats think they 've got it but they don't , ” says Quinnipiac ’s Peter Brown , a longtime Michigan observer .
“ Obama should be killing [ McCain ] there , but there 's a lot more racial tension in Michigan than in other states . ”
Obama also has n’t pulled away in other Democrat - friendly neighboring states , watching leads in Wisconsin and Minnesota erode over the last month .
4 . Bad times could be good for McCain .
If anger helps Democrats , fear works to the advantage of Republicans .
A growing number of Democratic strategists worry that some swing state voters may opt for McCain if the economy veers from merely awful to downright terrifying .
The typical political calculus — that bad economic times will deliver the White House to Democrats — may not hold if people start viewing the downturn as , essentially , a national security crisis that ca n’t be entrusted to a novice .
And that was McCain ’s underlying message in his Paris Hilton ad : Bank failures , soaring gas prices and plummeting house values are forms of economic terrorism , and he ’s an all - purpose anti-terror warrior .
“ John McCain is a known quantity , ” says Bob Kerrey , who thinks Obama will ultimately prevail .
“ You do n't look at John and say , ‘ Who the heck is he ? ’.
He 's a veteran , he 's a guy who got pretty banged up in Vietnam .
He can deal with crisis .
There 's some uncertainty about Senator Obama . ”
The good news for Obama , of course , is that McCain — who infamously admitted he “ never understood ” economics — is loathed by unions , was somnambulant at the dawn of the housing meltdown and still gropes for a coherent economic policy that does n’t include the words “ offshore drilling . ”
But he does n’t have to win the argument , just reinforce doubts about Obama with wavering swing state voters .
The Illinois senator still enjoys a major edge on the economic issues , but his 20 - point June lead on the question of who can best fix the economy slipped to a 17 - point edge in July , according to the Pew Research Center .
“ Obama wins on the economy , ” said Guy Cecil , Hillary Clinton ’s field director during the primaries .
“ But it will be interesting to see if McCain ’s able to close the economic gap . ”
5 . Where have you gone , Ross Perot ?
Bill Clinton , the lone two - term Democratic president since FDR , would n’t have been elected if independent Ross Perot had n’t siphoned 19 percent of the vote in 1992 .
Former Georgia Rep. Bob Barr , staging an indie bid from McCain ’s right , has little cash and does n’t seem to be a factor in competitive states .
6 . The Legacy of LBJ , Jimmy and Bubba .
Barack Obama would have been a trailblazer no matter what — but the Democrats ’ trail to the White House has been remarkably narrow since 1960 , accommodating only Southern whites with border - state strength : Lyndon Johnson , Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton .
( Add Al Gore if you ’re counting the popular vote . )
7. Americans may want divided government .
Some Democratic operatives think a possible landslide for their party in congressional races could backfire on Obama .
“ Fairly or not , folks think he ’s pretty liberal and nobody wants a pair of Pelosis running things , ” says a New York - based Democratic consultant .
Adds Bob Kerrey : “ The country 's still pretty divided … people may want a divided government .
They want change , but I 'm not sure that the Democratic agenda has the support of a majority of Americans . ”

Politics
Mr. Kimbrough is an Obama supporter but he would not hazard a guess as to how his white buddies will vote .
He said economic disaster had exacerbated racial tensions .
With the mills closed , the work force is resegregating .
Carl Davidson , a white friend and an Obama supporter , sat in Mr. Kimbrough ’s living room .
“ My father voted for Edwards in the primary and now he wants McCain , ” said Mr. Davidson , whose father and grandfather labored in the mills .
“ Without realizing it , he ’s wrapped up in white - identity politics . ”
Sorting out white - voter discomfort with Mr. Obama is tricky business .
Most speak of unease with his newness .
But one in five primary voters surveyed in the Edison / Mitofsky exit poll in Pennsylvania said race was a factor .
Ivan Stickles , a carpenter , worked on his motorcycle in his driveway in Hopewell .
Mr. Stickles , 57 , is not taking what he sees as a gamble on Obama .
“ There ’s this e-mail that he did n’t shake hands with the troops , ” Mr. Stickles said of a rumor that is false .
“ I do n’t have the time to check out if it ’s true , but if it is , it ’s very offensive . ”
In Hookstown , Kristine Lakovich , 48 , works the counter at Kiner ’s Superette .
She likes Mr. Obama , a preference she keeps to herself .
“ If you ask people around here , he ’s not exactly the right answer , ” Ms. Lakovich said .
“ People are split between their politics and their prejudice . ”
Nationally , the Obama campaign shies from talk of race , preferring to argue that the poor economy will dominate this election .
Such delicacy holds no purchase here .
An organizer with the United Steelworkers met with 30 workers in Beaver .
He could not have been blunter .
Mr. Obama , he told them , stands for national health care , strong unions and preserving Social Security .

LEE SUSTAR'S analysis of the political crisis facing Zimbabwe is spot - on ( " Mugabe 's murderous crackdown " ) .
However , in addition to the reasons Sustar cites that explain why the deeply unpopular Mugabe regime remains in power -- historic support ( both financial and political ) from African neighbors ; cozy relations with Russia and China -- Sustar leaves one obvious reason for the durability of Mugabe and his ruling clique unexplored .
During a recent broadcast of National Public Radio's Marketplace program , a report aired that exposed the complicity of some of Britain 's largest private financial institutions , like Barclays of London , in the continued ZANU - PF stranglehold over everyday life in Zimbabwe .
According to the report , Barclays operates a banking house in Harare that makes direct loans to members of Mugabe 's inner circle , thereby providing a vital lifeline for the regime in the form of hard currency .
Characteristically , and wrongly , Barclays claims that if it shut down operations in Zimbabwe , the catastrophic economic crisis facing ordinary Zimbabweans would worsen , since " several thousand " Zimbabweans maintain accounts there .
While Western powers continue to talk tough about " respect for democratic processes " in Zimbabwe , they turn a blind eye to financiers and powerbrokers in their own countries that continue to conduct extremely lucrative business with one of the most odious governments on the African continent .
British Prime Minister Gordon Brown ( demonstrating just how far New Labour has lurched to the right ) managed to issue only a limpid statement urging British firms that do business with Mugabe 's regime to " reconsider " their dealings .
As Sustar points out , the movement for real democratic reforms will continue in Zimbabwe , despite bloody repression .
Socialists in the West must demonstrate solidarity with the democracy activists in Zimbabwe by continuing to expose and condemn the complicity of Western firms and the governments that cover for them at every turn .
James Fiorentino , Amherst , Mass .
In an interview at her home in a public housing complex southwest of Paris , the first she has given since her citizenship was denied , Ms. Silmi told of her shock and embarrassment when she found herself unexpectedly in the public eye .
Since July 12 , when Le Monde first reported the court decision , her story has been endlessly dissected on newspaper front pages and in late - night television talk shows .
“ They say I am under my husband ’s command and that I am a recluse , ” Ms. Silmi said during an hourlong conversation in her apartment in La Verrière , a small town 30 minutes by train from Paris .
At home , when no men are present , she lifts her facial veil and exposes a smiling , heart - shaped face .
“ They say I wear the niqab because my husband told me so , ” she said .
“ I want to tell them :
It is my choice .
I take care of my children , and I leave the house when I please .
I have my own car .
I do the shopping on my own .
Yes , I am a practicing Muslim , I am orthodox .
But is that not my right ? ”
Ms. Silmi declined to have her photograph taken , saying that she and her husband were uncomfortable with the idea .
Eight years ago , Ms. Silmi married Karim , a French national of Moroccan descent , and moved to France with him .
Their four children , three boys and a girl , ages 2 to 7 , were born in France .
In 2004 , Ms. Silmi applied for French citizenship , she said , “ because I wanted to have the same nationality as my husband and my children . ”
But her request was denied a year later because of “ insufficient assimilation ” into France .
She appealed , invoking the right to religious freedom .
But in late June , the Council of State , the judicial institution with final say on disputes between individuals and the public administration , upheld the ruling .

“ She has adopted a radical practice of her religion , incompatible with essential values of the French community , particularly the principle of equality of the sexes , ” the ruling said .
Anyone who has ever called themselves a feminist - even with a laugh in their voice and a toss of their hair - knows that the word is a red rag to misogynists , and that in the face of this , you have to find ways to bolster yourself .
Deep - held conviction helps , as does the camaraderie of brilliant , politicised women .
There 's the self - respect that comes with recognising that not having a penis is no actual impediment , and , finally , crucially , there 's the element of results : the sense that the culture is chugging forward .
There has always been resistance to feminism - the backlash that Susan Faludi chronicled in her 1991 book of the same name .
But there is also the satisfaction of arguments won , rights enshrined , respect ensured , the sense that the central feminist project - the fight for women to be treated as human beings , no more , no less - is inching along .
In fact , reading a recent piece by US feminist writer , Katha Pollitt , headlined Backlash Spectacular and charting the ways in which North American culture is regressing on women 's rights , I felt smug .
Thank God that 's not happening here , I thought , sinking into my seat and reaching for another chocolate .
Of course , if you 're feeling smug , you 've got it wrong .
In the weeks after Pollitt 's article , I found myself tripping over signs , left and right , that not only does the feminist movement still have far to go , but that arguments we thought were long - won have been re-opened , rights we thought were settled are suddenly under threat .
These signs came in a whole variety of forms , some ridiculous , some devastating .
On the ridiculous side , for instance , came a survey by Marketing magazine of the nation 's most - loved and least - loved celebrities .
The respondents ' top five most loved were men : Paul McCartney , Lewis Hamilton , Gary Lineker , Simon Cowell and David Beckham .
Of the five most hated , the top four were women : Heather Mills , Amy Winehouse , Victoria Beckham and Kerry Katona , with Simon Cowell coming in at number five .
On some level , reacting to this at all seemed stupid , and yet ...
Another small sign came in the response to a post on the British feminist website the F Word .
The average number of comments on any post on the site is around 10 , but after one of the site 's bloggers asked whether readers had experienced street harassment , hundreds of responses poured in .
" Of course , " wrote one woman , " I ca n't go out without being honked at , and people have asked me to ' suck their cock ' when I was just walking down the street . "
" Yup , " wrote another , " got threatened with rape on my way home just under a fortnight ago - when I responded angrily the creeps followed me down the road . "
Then there are all the signs about attitudes to women and work .
Flicking through the newspapers one day , I came across an interview with Theo Paphitis , who appears on the TV show , Dragon 's Den , as well as on the country 's Rich List each year ; he is easily one of the UK 's most prominent business people .
" All this feminist stuff , " he said , " are we seriously saying that 50 % of all jobs should go to women ? "
Paphitis went on to note that women " get themselves bloody pregnant and ... they always argue that they 'll be working until the day before , have the baby , go down to the river , wash it off , give it to the nanny and be back at work the following day , but sure enough , their brains turn to mush , and then after the birth the maternal instincts kick in , they take three months off , get it out of their system and are back to normal " .
On the subject of paternity leave he suggested that he thinks " it 's a bit soppy " .
And , sadly , Paphitis is n't alone in his unreconstructed views .
In interviews earlier this year , Alan Sugar , Amstrad founder , Apprentice star and government business adviser , repeatedly challenged a law instituted more than three decades ago .
This law was one of the big wins of the 1970s feminist movement , making it illegal for women to be asked at interview whether they plan to have children , on the grounds that it is clearly discriminatory : a chance for employers to weed out any woman who wants to combine a family with work .
" You 're not allowed to ask , so it 's easy , " said Sugar , " just do n't employ them . "
A survey showed that 68 % of employers agree with Sugar , and it was at this point , admits Katherine Rake , director of equality campaign , the Fawcett Society , that she seriously began to worry that a major backlash was underway - suddenly she found herself having to speak up for rights that are so long - established they had seemed entirely beyond debate .
More cause for concern arrived in a particularly unlikely and depressing figure : former feminist icon , Rosie Boycott , one of the founders of the ground - breaking 70s magazine , Spare Rib .
Writing in the Sunday Times , Boycott , who now runs a smallholding , said that " my pigs certainly are n't going to thrive on flexi - feeding schemes .
And neither is my business .
Little wonder , then , that plenty of angry voices were last week demanding that women should get back to the kitchen " .
If women are n't wanted in the workplace - and the fact that we 're still paid 17 % less than men for full - time work , 36 % less for part - time work , is a sign in itself - then at least our right to be safe from violence is recognised and protected , right ?
Far from it .
Just as the attitudes of business leaders seem to be regressing at speed , the number of women being killed by a current or former partner has remained constant at two a week , and the rape conviction rate has been diminishing to the point of near - invisibility .
I was reminded of this last fact when the Washington Post , a newspaper that rarely picks up on British feminist issues ( the US frankly having enough issues of its own ) ran a long article about this disgrace in our justice system .
The piece pointed out that the rape conviction rate in Britain has plummeted from 33 % in the 70s to just 5.7 % today , and that the 14,000 rapes reported each year are thought to be the tip of the iceberg - Solicitor General , Vera Baird , suggested that only 10 % - 20 % of all cases are brought to the attention of the authorities .
The article quoted a barrister called Kerim Fuad , who has represented many men accused of rape , and who admitted that he had been surprised by some " not guilty " verdicts - including those in which the plaintiff had sustained internal injuries .
It alluded to an Amnesty International poll , conducted in 2005 , which found that 26 % of respondents thought that a woman was totally or partially responsible for being raped if she was wearing revealing clothing , and 30 % thought she was totally or partially responsible if she was drunk .
How does the wider culture respond to this ?
Does it do everything it can to make sure that rapists are punished , that women are granted justice , that the balance is redressed ?
It does not .
In the years in which the rape conviction rate has stood at a point so insultingly low that it represents a backlash in and of itself , the papers have often focused , not on the victims , not on the rapists , but instead on running multiple articles about women who have apparently lied about being raped .
The number of women who take false complaints to the police is thought to stand at 3 % of the total , as it does with other crimes , but the media focus has casually , simply , successfully , helped ingrain in the public imagination that , when it comes to rape , women lie - a notion that , naturally , has a rather serious effect when it comes to trial by jury .
If rapists are n't going to be punished , then there must at least be good support services in place for women who have been raped .
Well , no .
The women 's movement of the 70s and early 80s fought for provision for rape victims , a network of Rape Crisis centres , and , by 1984 , there were 68 of these essential services across England and Wales .
Today , with rapes at an unprecedented high ( the tally of recorded rapes rose by 247 % between 1991 and 2004 ) , the number of Rape Crisis centres has almost halved - there are now only 38 .
This massive shortfall in services is less surprising when you consider that three of the most important women 's charities in the UK - Refuge , Women 's Aid and Eaves Housing for Women - all of which support female victims of violence , have a combined income considerably lower than that of The Donkey Sanctuary , a charity that supports ageing donkeys .
As the number of Rape Crisis centres plummets , the number of lapdancing clubs has proliferated , bolstered by a 2003 change in licensing laws , which bracketed them with coffee shops and karaoke bars .
Since this legislative change came into effect , the number of lapdancing clubs has doubled .
In the small city of Brighton and Hove , for instance , six clubs opened in quick succession and across the country they are now opening at a rate of almost one each week .
The government has recently pledged to tackle this issue , by reclassifying lapdancing clubs as " sex encounter " establishments , and while that 's great , it does n't change what we 've learned in the meantime - the fact that there is clearly a massive demand for these clubs , that venues which involve women 's bodies being marketed to men are patently a brilliant business proposition .
This is n't surprising when you consider that the sex industry is more casually accepted than ever : one in 10 men now admit to having visited a prostitute , stag party visits to brothels are seen as par for the course , and the consumption of internet pornography has gone far beyond the point of familiarity .
The rise of the sex industry is one indication of how women 's bodies are considered public property ; in the wider culture , we 've seen scrutiny of women reach unprecedented levels .
In gossip magazines , women 's bodies are pored over - a pound gained provoking headlines that they 're fat , a pound lost leading to headlines that they 're too thin .
Circles are drawn around a spot on their ankle where they 've failed to apply fake tan , around a bitten nail or a tiny , incipient wrinkle beside their eye - which could just be a stray lash .
What is implicit but unsaid is that there is no objective standard of beauty , no level of perfection that a woman could reach at which her body would be perceived as acceptable and in control .
In the eyes of these magazines , a healthy body mass index could be considered seriously plump .
A woman deemed too fat in one magazine could , on the basis of exactly the same picture , be deemed too thin by another magazine .
The constant message is that women 's bodies are not our own .
They belong to everyone but us , and are there to be picked apart .
Women can try to curry favour , come up to snuff , spend hours like , say , Madonna , working out , perfecting themselves .
But there 's then every chance that they will be derided for the veins on their hands .
There 's something essentially depressing about women being derided for their veins .
That intense scrutiny of women 's bodies is one trend in pop culture .
Another related one is the current obsession with women as mothers , a trend being played out all over our cinema screens - in films including Juno , Knocked Up , Baby Mama , Happy Endings , Waitress and Smart People .
It 's also being played out in the gossip magazines .
In the past few years we have seen Jennifer Lopez paid a reported $ 6 m ( £ 3 m ) for exclusive pictures of her with her twin babies ; Angelina Jolie is expected to clear $ 10 m if she agrees to pose with the twins she will give birth to later this year .
In fact , the obsession is such that one magazine editor has said that " it 's at the point now where some stars might decide to have more kids just to collect the money from their photos " .
We 've seen Christina Aguilera , Britney Spears , former child star Melissa Joan Hart and Myleene Klass all pose naked and pregnant in the past few years - as Keri Russell , an actor who has played a pregnant woman in two films in the past year has said , there is " this weird , crazy pop-culture infatuation with all these actresses being pregnant .
Have you ever seen so many pictures of [ pregnant ] actresses ? "
Indeed not .
The message that these images strike home is that women 's worth is directly tied to childbearing , the constant images of mothers are a siren call for women to get back into the home , and yet we 're also seeing more and more blame put on mothers .
Women whose children are murdered or abducted are increasingly blamed for not having looked after their offspring well enough , for not having been on constant watch ; those who work with the victims of child sexual abuse say that this is true in those cases too - there is often more blame put on the mother of a child who has been abused , than whoever actually abused them .
And on a more day - to - day basis , it seems that it 's impossible for women to live up to social standards of motherhood .
Mothers who go out to work are seen as neglectful , those who stay at home are seen as dullards .
Today 's mothers are regularly defined as too overbearing - when they 're not being reviled as too lax .
The other big gossip - magazine trend is for women to be depicted as " mad " .
Over the past few years we 've seen a massive media obsession with women who are considered to be out of control - Britney Spears , Amy Winehouse , Lindsay Lohan and , to a lesser extent , Paris Hilton - and it's hard to avoid the sense that people want to watch these women 's story arcs reach the same conclusion as that of their predecessor , the former Playboy model Anna Nicole Smith , who died of an overdose last year .
Of course , at one point there was also a massive interest in Pete Doherty 's behaviour , but it 's notable that this was when he was going out with Kate Moss , and his transgressions therefore reflected on her .
Once they had broken up , that interest quickly waned .
These pop cultural trends have been around for a few years , but one longstanding issue that renewed itself very recently was the backlash against abortion rights .
This crept up on me suddenly in late Spring - I knew that a Conservative MP , Nadine Dorries , was campaigning to bring the abortion time limit down from 24 weeks to 20 weeks , but until a few days before the Commons vote on this issue , I had no idea that amendments had been tabled to bring the time limit down to 12 weeks , 14 weeks , 16 weeks , 18 weeks , 22 weeks .
And while the outcome of that vote was a retention of the time limit , that was only because of the Labour majority in the House of Commons .
Eighteen shadow cabinet ministers voted to reduce the limit to 22 weeks ; David Cameron voted to reduce it to 20 weeks .
A survey of prospective Conservative MPs found that only 9 % would vote in favour of the current time limit - 86 % want a lower limit .
With figures like this , there seems no doubt that it could be very difficult to retain current abortion rights if the Conservatives come to power , as many now consider inevitable .
And this is especially true since analysis of parliamentary candidates shows that the already appallingly low rate of women in government - they make up just under 20 % of MPs - may well fall given a Tory influx at the next election , and certainly wo n't rise .
" My big concern , " says Rake , " is making sure that we create a feminist debate that sustains us through however many terms of Tory government we 're going to have " .
And there are plenty of other signs that we 're going to need such a debate - in fact , the backlash is intensely bound up with the current rightward shift in politics .
Since taking office as Mayor of London , for instance , one of Boris Johnson 's first acts has been to axe the role of women 's adviser ; an insider was quoted in the Evening Standard as saying that Johnson saw the role as a " throwback to the Eighties GLC " .
Thankfully , there are signs that the feminist debate is growing - in fact , many of those I spoke to believe that this is exactly why the backlash is so strong at the moment .
Before the abortion vote took place in the Commons , for instance , a large group of women gathered outside Parliament , and formed a rowdy protest against this potential assault on our rights .
Rake says that membership of Fawcett has shot up recently , because " as the progressive space closes down at a national level , it just opens up somewhere else ...
I do think that there 's a general unease about the culture - we 've been campaigning on the lapdancing issue , and we 've had a lot of people saying , ' Thank God someone 's finally saying something about the fact that I have to walk past a lapdancing club just to get home every night ' .
I think that there 's that general concern about backslip on cultural issues , and then just a concern that , while on other issues we 're moving vaguely in the right direction , the progress is incredibly slow .
That 's led to a kind of militancy that 's re-arising now , in all sorts of quarters . "
She points to the revival of the Reclaim the Night marches , and the recent Million Women Rise march .
" I do think that there 's a sense that people are beginning to get active , because they 're also all waking up to the fact that a lot of the rights that we 've taken for granted , ca n't be .
I think that that activism and recognition is a cause for optimism . "
Professor Liz Kelly , chair of the End Violence Against Women campaign agrees that we 're in a time of resistance , but also sees a positive side to the situation : " I think that you always get the greatest resistance when you 're actually doing something , " she says .
" I think it signals that there 's a slightly stronger sense of feminist organisation and voice than there was 10 years ago .
The irony , of course , is that you only get resistance if there 's something to be resisted . "
A friend of mine , a long - time feminist activist , notes that " there 's always been a backlash , ever since day one of women 's existence - long before it 's ever been documented .
So the concept of backlash is always alive , it 's just that there are times when you think that we are really sinking into a cesspit .
What I would say , though , is that , for all the resistance , I do n't think we ever take two steps back .
I think we only ever take steps forward , but those steps can be smaller and harder , like wading through treacle , or sometimes you can have a little sprint , a spurt , and think , ' That 's fantastic , we 've won that little battle . '
" What a backlash does is that it curtails us , but we never take those two steps back , and that 's what I think can send the conservatives - and I mean that with a small ' c ' - and the rightwingers , and the upholders of the traditional family , absolutely wild , because whatever they throw at us , so what ?
What do they think we 're going to do ?
Go back to how we were before ?
Go back into the kitchen and make them a sandwich ?
We might be wading through treacle at the moment , " she says , " but the fact is that they wo n't actually win " .
Tskhinvali is not Sarejevo in 1914 .
South Ossetia will not be the start - line of the Third World War .
But it is a ghastly mess , all the more depressing because the West is partly to blame .
In diplomacy , strategy and geopolitics , our political leaders have been guilty of multiple failures over many years .
First , diplomacy .
President Mikheil Saakashvili of Georgia is a headstrong fellow .
Reference has been made to his Harvard education as if that should ensure sound judgement .
Alas , however , the President 's tutor was not the greatest of Harvard diplomatists , Henry Kissinger – but Anthony Eden at Suez .
Mr Saakashvili has only one defence against the charge of criminal irresponsibility : a plea of insanity .
So where were the Western diplomats with straitjackets and hard words ?
It may be that the President was so headstrong as to be beyond counsel , but it would have been worth trying : pointing out to him that his intended actions would have inevitable consequences and that Georgia would be facing them on its own .
Even if it might not have worked , it should have been tried .
Yet just when the game was in a crucial phase , British and American diplomats took their eye off the ball .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
There is a further diplomatic problem .
Georgia would like to join Nato , for obvious if naive reasons .
Most Georgians have persuaded themselves that if they were Nato members , we would defend our freedoms shoulder to shoulder with theirs , on the Georgian - Russian frontier .
That is nonsense .
The moment Nato extended guarantees to Georgia or the Ukraine would be the moment Nato either ceased to exist as a credible defensive alliance or – more likely – turned into an organised hypocrisy .
It would become a two - tier structure , in which new members were invited to contribute troops but not offered protection when they most needed it .
Alas , however , all the talk about Nato encouraged Georgian adventurism .
It helped President Saakashvili to think that he could behave like a founder member .
He concluded that he could provoke Russia with impunity .
The Russians concluded that it was time to teach him a lesson .
That should not have been necessary .
Rather than waiting for the Russians to instil the fear of death , the West should have taught Georgia the facts of life .
We ought to have reminded them that they were living in a dangerous neighbourhood .
A small nation that has only recently become independent from a neighbouring superpower still resentful at many of the changes which have overtaken it must tread warily .
Eighty per cent of Georgians would like to join Nato .
One suspects that a similar percentage of Taiwanese would like to become fully independent .
Neither country is in the position to conduct its foreign affairs by writing letters to Santa Claus .
Over time , the Taiwanese have come to accept this ; the Georgians should have been helped to do so .
The West 's diplomatic weakness rests on the shoulders of a longer - term strategic incompetence .
We failed to think through the consequences of our victory in the Cold War .
As a result , we have not done enough to consolidate our gains .
We failed to build on the geo-strategic triumphs of the Reagan - Thatcher era .
In 1979 , Mrs Thatcher was threatened by socialism at home – abetted by Soviet fellow - travellers – and by Finlandisation on the Continent .
That latter contest was equally important to the Americans .
The West won , and our victory was even more impressive for costing so little in blood .
But that was not the sole diplomatic achievement of the great Reagan - Thatcher era .
Both the President and the Prime Minister were alert to changing circumstances .
They recognised Mr Gorbachev as a bridge to a new era , even before he had decided to cross it .
They understood the Churchillian maxim : " In victory , magnanimity . "
By 1990 , there was a powerful case for scrapping the West's Cold War concepts while keeping our weapons systems , just in case .
Despite their reputation for intransigence , Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher would have been ready to exploit new opportunities .
They would have understood the need to move beyond Nato , now that it had served its original purposes .
By the early 1990s , there was a need for a new system of collective security in Europe , embracing the Russians .
Once Moscow had renounced the ill - gotten gains of 1944 - 45 , we should have welcomed the Russians back to a Europe which had been spiritually impoverished by their absence .
On a practical level , we should have pressed on with Mr Reagan 's offer to share anti-ballistic missile technology with the Russians : why not employ some of their scientists in the research work ?
Once the Communist threat was lifted and the Soviet Empire dismantled , we had no quarrel with Russia .
A sustained peace - making effort over the past 15 years would have created a diplomatic means of solving the Georgian question before it became one .
Instead , we have a sullen and truculent Russia demanding respect with menaces .
It is possible to make some excuses for all this .
The Russian version of history moves from the sacrifices of the Great Patriotic War to the voluntary renunciation of Empire , neither of them receiving adequate gratitude from the West .
More recently , on a smaller scale , there is the independence of Kosovo .
If Kosovo , why not South Ossetia or Abkhazia ?
Most Russians do not accept that they have done anything wrong .
The Putin-Medvedev administration has a higher popularity score than George Bush and Gordon Brown put together .
The excuses only go so far .
The Russians are not fighting Georgia to defend the rights of small nations .
They also want to remind Europe where much of its energy comes from .
A secure pipeline through Georgia would enable the West to receive oil supplies from Azerbaijan which did not pass through Russian territory .
That pipeline is no longer secure , which is why Georgia is more than a quarrel in a faraway country between people of whom we know nothing .
This brings us to the failure of geopolitical thinking .
Whichever brute or blaggard made the world , he has a black sense of humour .
Much of the oil on which the West depends is located in countries upon whom no one would wish to depend .
But this is not a new problem .
It has been apparent for two decades , which is why the French in particular have moved so heavily into nuclear power .
We in Britain , less far - sighted , have a choice between clapped - out power stations , fantasies about renewable energy and the vagaries of the international oil market .
Our failure to find a nuclear alternative is comparable to our failure to rearm in the late 1930s .
Now , as then , it could open us to blackmail and condemn us to appeasement .
Those are longer - term questions , which is no excuse for not addressing them as a matter of urgency .
In the short - run , Britain , the EU and above all the US will have the task of bringing some relief to the battered people of Georgia .
There is little that we can do beyond calling for restraint , urging a ceasefire , begging all men of goodwill etc .
The Georgians will have to give up the struggle to hold on to South Ossetia and they may as well prepare themselves to lose Abkhazia as well .
If only that were the end of the problem .
Jennifer Aniston's HOT New Ad Campaign Photos
has hit the big time .
Not only is she a spokesperson for Smartwater , but her likeness graces not a magazine cover but the entire side of the Hyatt Building on Sunset Blvd. in West Hollywood .
The 12 story building has Jennifer Aniston prominently superimposed over the entire side of the structure .
The photo is hot and is likely to cause quite a stir .
The photo has a 3D look , as if the actress was sitting up there while enjoying the view .
We hope that the gigantic display wo n't be a traffic hazard .
We would expect more than one drive by gawker will be cramming on the brakes while gazing skyward at Aniston .
The ad campaign uses a quote from the celebrity :
" I love the reflection of water ( but what I drink is a reflection of me ) . "
Check out the rest of the photos below .

Video : Screensaver reveals new test for synaesthesia
Do you hear the dots moving when you watch the video ?
Then let us know in the comments below .
It sounds like a Zen conundrum : what is the sound of dots moving ?
Most of us ca n’t answer that question , but for people with a newly identified form of synaesthesia , hearing such sights is the most natural thing in the world .
Melissa Saenz at Caltech in Pasadena was tipped off when a visitor looked at her screensaver , which made no noise , and said , “ Does anyone else hear that ? ”
She quizzed him and found that his experience had the hallmarks of synaesthesia : a trigger through one sense was giving rise to a sensory experience in another .
It was automatic and her visitor had experienced it as far back as he could remember .

To round up a few more test subjects , she passed around the noisy image via email .
To her surprise , a few hundred viewers yielded three more of the new synaesthetes .
She showed them a variety of visual stimuli , from moving dots to flashes of light .
Depending on the stimulus , people described simple abstract sounds such as tapping , thumping , whirring or whooshing .
Visual Morse
Saenz and collaborator Christof Koch set out to develop a task that would allow synaesthetes to outperform other people if the auditory sensation was real .
Saenz knew that humans are able to judge patterns in time much better using sound than vision , so she developed a simple type of Morse code .
She asked her subjects to either listen to or watch two sequences before saying whether they were identical .
In reality half were the same and half different .
Everyone was about 85 % accurate on the sound trials , but whereas controls got only 55 % of the visual rhythms right , synaesthetes remained steady at 85 % .
As they later reported , they were helped by being able to hear the flashes as well as see them .
“ The choice of task is great , ” says Jamie Ward at the University of Sussex in Brighton , UK .
“ You ca n’t fake being better . ”
He adds that new types of synaesthesia are being uncovered all the time .
Saenz is following up her study with brain imaging and is also eager to recruit new subjects .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
A new national poll suggests the battle for the Democratic presidential nomination between Sens. Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama is a tie .
Sen . Hillary Clinton speaks Monday at a town hall meeting in Hammond , Indiana .
Forty - six percent of registered Democratic voters questioned in a CNN / Opinion Research Corp. survey released Thursday support Obama as their party 's nominee and 45 percent back Clinton .
It 's a statistical tie when taking into account the poll 's 4.5 percentage point sampling error on that question .
" In mid-March , Obama had a 52 percent to 45 percent edge over Clinton , but his support has dropped six points while she has not gained any ground , " said Keating Holland , CNN polling director .
He said " 6 percent now volunteer that they want neither one to be the nominee ; no Democrats in the March poll felt that way . "
" Obama has lost his edge , '' said Bill Schneider , CNN senior political analyst .
" Is it because of the controversy over his former pastor , Jeremiah Wright ?
While most Democrats have an unfavorable opinion of Wright , only 19 percent say Wright 's statements have made them less favorable to Obama .
More than two thirds say they 've had no effect at all . "
" The bigger problem appears to be Obama 's string of losses to Clinton in big states like Pennsylvania and Ohio .
Those losses have not driven up Clinton 's support .
But they may have created doubts about Obama 's ability to win , " Schneider said .
But the poll suggests
Wright certainly does n't help the Illinois senator .

" Among all Americans , Wright gets a 59 percent unfavorable rating ; only 9 percent of the public has a favorable view and a third are unfamiliar with him .
Among Democrats , the figures are virtually the same , " Holland said .
" Roughly a quarter of registered voters and roughly one in five Democrats say they have heard about Wright 's remarks and think less favorably about Obama because of them .
Most , however , say their view of Obama did not change after hearing about Wright . "
The poll also indicates the public is more familiar with Wright now than they were in March , when he first became a presence in the campaign , but the number who feel less favorable toward Obama has not grown since the second round of controversy about Wright erupted last week .
Overall , Clinton and Obama remain extremely popular among Democrats , but enthusiasm for both candidates is flagging as the battle for the nomination wears on .
Holland said just one thing separates Obama and Clinton in the minds of Democratic voters -- by a 20 - point margin , 57 to 37 percent , Obama is seen as the one who is more likely to become the party 's standard - bearer .
Obama leads the New York senator when it comes to pledged delegates , the popular vote and states won in the primaries and caucuses held to date .
A big question facing Democrats concerns the party coming together and backing the eventual nominee .
Will die - hard Clinton supporters back Obama if he 's the nominee and will devoted Obama supporters get behind Clinton if she 's the nominee ?
According to the poll , the number of Democrats who would feel enthusiastic if Clinton were the nominee has fallen from 45 percent in January to 38 percent in March to 33 percent now .
Enthusiasm for an Obama victory has also dropped , from 45 percent in March down to 36 percent now .
As for possible November showdowns with Arizona Sen .
John McCain , the Democratic candidates have virtually identical but statistically insignificant advantages over the presumed Republican nominee .
Clinton and Obama both say they are more likely to beat McCain , but the poll shows each of them winning 49 percent against the Arizona senator , with Clinton topping McCain by five points and Obama beating him by four points .
The polls , however , were taken before both parties settle on a nominee and are not necessarily good indications of what will happen in November .
The CNN / Opinion Research Corp. poll was conducted by telephone from April 28 - 30 , with 1,008 adult Americans interviewed , including 906 registered voters and 441 registered voters who describe themselves as Democrats , or as independents who lean Democratic .
The survey 's sampling error is plus or minus 3 points for the overall poll and plus or minus 4.5 percentage points for the Democratic questions .

SAN DIEGO , July 23 ( Reuters ) - San Diego City Attorney Michael Aguirre said on Wednesday he filed a lawsuit against Bank of America Corp BAC.N and its Countrywide unit to prevent the mortgage lenders from foreclosing on homes in his city , which he aims to make a " foreclosure sanctuary . "
Aguirre plans to file similar lawsuits against Washington Mutual Inc WM.N , Wells Fargo & Co WFC.N and Wachovia Corp WB.N in an effort to make the lenders negotiate with mortgage borrowers facing foreclosure .
“ We would like to see San Diego become a foreclosure sanctuary , ” Aguirre said .
Housing markets across Southern California , including the city of San Diego and the county of the same name , are seeing steep increases in foreclosure rates because so many homes bought there earlier this decade involved subprime mortgages and other types of risky loans .
So far this year , 20,000 homes in San Diego County , population 2.9 million , have been lost to foreclosure as borrowers fail to keep up with mortgage payments and some analysts forecast the number may rise to 40,000 by the end of the year .
“ We have n’t seen the lawsuit and ca n’t comment , ” said Bank of America spokeswoman Shirley Norton .
In statement provided by Norton , Bank of America said it has been reviewing in detail Countrywide ’s operations since acquiring the lender earlier this month and the combined company will not sell subprime mortgages .
“ We are working hard to combine our two companies and are confident we will be recognized as a leader in responsible lending practices , ” the statement said .
Aguirre announced the lawsuit , filed in San Diego County Superior Court on Wednesday morning , at a news conference in front of an abandoned , fire - damaged house in a neighborhood hit hard by foreclosures .
The house is now in Countrywide ’s possession .
Boards cover its windows , its front entrance is charred and burned debris is scattered among tall weeds in its yard , the result of a fire set by transients who had moved in , said San Diego Police Department Sgt. James Filley .
Aguirre ’s lawsuit , brought in the name of the people of California , names four current and former Countrywide officers , including former CEO Angelo Mozilo , and alleges they personally profited from selling shares of the lender ’s stock while knowing its subprime loans did not comply with company policies .
“ The Countrywide executives who originated these subprime loans were engaged in a massive fraud on homeowners , borrowers and investors , ” Aguirre said .
“ They enriched themselves by over $ 1 billion . ”
“ We have the big stick of being found in violation of the law and the carrot of taking something that is a nonperforming asset , that all these houses are , and making it a performing asset by keeping the families in it . ”

Country Briefs :
Algeria : Algeria is an important exporter of both oil and natural gas ( background .ppt on NG supplies to Europe ) .
Algeria is Europe ’s third largest supplier of natural gas , providing 30 + bcm via pipelines and 20 + bcm via LNG tanker in 2007 .
Major projects are currently underway to expand pipeline infrastructure to Italy ( via Tunisia ) and to Spain ( both direct undersea and via Morocco ) , and to expand LNG export capability .
Algeria hopes to expand total natural gas exports to 85 bcm / year by 2010 , making their production roughly the equivalent of Norway ( Europe ’s 2nd largest provider ) .
Significantly , the potential to expand natural gas supplies to Europe enhances Algeria ’s importance as an alternative supplier in light of current dependence on uncertain Russian gas supplies .
Algeria also faces an active Islamist insurgency , a separate threat from the rising al - Qa'ida in the Land of the Islamic Maghreb , and serious demographic challenges in the form of a 1.22 % population growth rate ( graph ) and sharp ethnic divisions ( map ) .
Figure 1 : Algeria 's Place Among African Natural Gas Reserves
Morocco : Morocco 's importance to the global economy is due to its control of at least 2/3 of the world 's reserves of rock phosphate .
The USGS has stated that there are no substitutes ( .pdf ) for rock phosphate in agriculture .
With biofuel demand increasing steadily , and world food shortages hitting the headlines , rock phosphate is arguably as important to the world situation as oil supply .
Importantly , Patrick Dery has performed a Hubbert Lineraization on world phosphorus production and estimates that we have already passed peak phosphorus ( see graph below ) .
While the importance of rock phosphate has been discussed here before , its impact on the situation between Morocco and Algeria has not .
Additionally , fertilizer supplies are a critical component of many biofuel projects , creating an interrelationship between phosphate and energy supplies .
Like Algeria , Morocco faces an internal Islamist insurgency ( though currently less troublesome than in Algeria ) and has significant demographic challenges with a population growth rate of 1.6 % ( graph ) and sharp ethnic divides ( map ) .
Figure 2 : Peak Phosphorus ?
A Hubbert Lineraization of Global Phosphate Production
Tensions : The Sand War , Western Sahara , and Islamist Insurgencies
There are several sources of tension between Morocco and Algeria .
The two states fought the Sand War from 1963 - 64 over a mineral - rich border territory .
In 1975 , when Morocco took control of Western Sahara , Algeria began overtly backing the Polisario Front in an ongoing insurgency that continued unchecked until a 1991 cease fire .
Both states also suffer from internal Islamist insurgencies , exacerbated by increasing demographic problems .
The situation in Algeria is most severe : after independence from France , the revolutionary National Liberation Front ruled the country until Islamists won the first free elections in 1991 , prompting the military to immediately seize control .
More than 160,000 people were killed in the ensuing civil war between 1992 and 2002 .
While the country is relatively peaceful today , factions of the Islamist rebels have remained , operating out of rural regions inside the Malian border and elsewhere in the Sahara , and have recently merged with al - Qa'ida to form AQIM ( al - Qa'ida in the Land of the Islamic Maghreb ) .
The group has recently carried out several attacks in Algeria , including the April 11 2007 Algiers Bombing , the December 11 2007 Algiers bombing , the 2007 Batna bombing , and the 2007 Dellys bombing , as well as being possibly involved in the 2007 Casablanca bombing in Morocco .
The pace of attacks has not slowed , with at least five bombings in the last two months alone .
Infrastructure Targeting ?
While Algerian Islamists have generally mirrored target selection of Islamist groups elsewhere , one attack in December , 2006 , specifically targeted Haliburton workers in Algeria .
This tactic , of targeting critical infrastructure and energy industries , has been increasing around the world as non-state groups everywhere realize that they can maximize their return on investment with these targets .
With rising internal threats and state sponsored proxy conflicts , and the potential for direct state military attacks no longer too remote to consider , it is concerning that both Algeria and Morocco present some extremely high ROI energy and resource infrastructure targets :
- Morocco : The Fosbucraa Conveyor , the world ’s longest conveyor belt , transporting phosphates from the world 's largest phosphate mine at Bou Kra 100 km to the port of el Aioun .
The conveyor was successfully attacked several times by the Polisario Front .
Here 's a satellite image .
- Algerian pipelines & LNG infrastructure : Algeria is chock full of high - vulnerability , high - consequence targets .
Algeria recently signed a 100 million euro contract with French defense firm
Thales to secure oil and gas pipelines .
With 16,200 km of major pipelines to protect in Algeria alone ( and scheduled to increase to 21,000 km by 2010 ) , the task is daunting .
Additionally , two potential future infrastructure projects may represent appealing targets .
The proposed Trans - Saharan natural gas pipeline , that would deliver Nigerian natural gas to Europe via a 4,550 km pipeline , would represent a lengthy and vulnerable target to multiple groups if it is ever built ( construction is “ penciled in ” to start in 2015 ) .
Additionally , speculative plans ( such as the Trans - Mediterranean Renewable Energy Cooperative , or TREC ) to leverage high solar insolation in the Sahara to generate electricity for Europe would require huge transmission infrastructure that would be both highly vulnerable and highly attractive .
Neither the Trans - Saharan pipeline nor TREC is in any danger of being built in the immediate future .
Thoughts on the Future : Proxy Wars & Proxy Mercantilism
Recently , the fragile 1991 cease fire agreement with the Western Saharan Polisario Front has become increasingly unstable .
Complicating the situation with Western Sahara , French President Sarkozy announced his support to Morocco 's decision to postpone indefinitely the self - determination referendum promised in the 1991 accord , along with increased Algerian support to Polisario leadership .
All this comes against a backdrop of rising military tensions between Morocco and Algeria .
In 2008 , the US doubled military aide to Morocco and announced arms deals worth billions of dollars .
At the same time , various sources confirmed that Russian concluded a $ 7.5 billion deal to provide advanced arms to Algeria .
Is there any deeper meaning behind these moves ?
At least two possibilities must be considered .
The first is proxy - mercantilism by the United States to secure control of phosphate supplies .
In 2004 , the US entered into a bi-lateral free trade agreement with Morocco .
This can be explained as a natural extension of the long history of economic and military cooperation between the US and Morocco , but in light of proposed biofuel programs , skyrocketing rock phosphate prices , potentially peaking phosphate production , and mercantilist moves by other great powers , the more nefarious possibilities must be considered .
The second possibility is that Russia hopes to leverage increased influence with Algeria to exert greater influence in global natural gas markets .
Because Algeria is one of Western Europe 's few true alternatives to Russian natural gas supplies , especially given the prospect of sharp increases in Algerian natural gas exports , Algeria represents either a threat to Russian natural gas leverage , or a great enhancement of that leverage by entering a defacto gas cartel .
At a minimum , we know that Russia and Algeria are actively engaged in talks on this topic .
Also , a recent offer by Gazprom to buy all of Libya 's additional oil and gas production supports this suggestions that Russia hopes to control Europe 's alternative sources of natural gas .
Both notions of phosphate mercantilism and a gas cartel are merely informed speculation at this point , but the stakes are so high that these possibilities must be considered .
While there may be no deeper motive behind recent moves with Morocco and Algeria , at a minimum the stakes and tensions are increasing .
Because both Algeria and Morocco are fragile Nation - States , with active Islamist separatist movements , significant internal terrorist threats , and complicated ethnic / territorial problems , the potential for interruption in critical exports of phosphate , oil , and gas is increasing .
but I wo n't allow for it as kissing leads to other .... stuff .
I wish for him to remain a virgin until he is married , just as our good Lord intended !!
Please do n't get me wrong , I 'm not opposed to sex , just sex before marriage ( which is a completely different topic anyway ) !
I have raised him to believe that pregnancy occurs through kissing .
He does not want to become a father and thus far , thankfully , has never kissed a girl .
However , he turned around to me the other day and told me that he really sees a future with this hussy and that he thinks he loves her ( lol , 13 year olds eh ? what do they know about love ?! ) , and if kissing means risking getting her pregnant , then it is a risk he wants to take .
I have shown him a birthing video and shown him the pain she will be in in 9 months if he kisses her , but he seems determined .
What else can I do to prevent him from kissing this slutty girl who is trying to get her claws in and lead my son astray ??
As an eleven year old boy in 1985 , Donald Wylie tossed a bottle into the Orkney sea , with a message asking its finder to track him down .
Almost a quarter of a century later , Donald will be reunited with the bottle which eventually washed up hundreds of miles away on the West Sands in St Andrews
The message in a bottle was the star find among debris collected by a team of keen eco-volunteers taking part in a community beach clean over the summer .
The group , which included students and staff from the University of St Andrews , were startled to find a message despatched to sea twenty - three years ago .
Organisers from the University and Fairmont St Andrews Hotel launched a search to find the sender and were delighted to track him down - still living in Orkney and a house builder .
When Donald confirmed the story , the organisers invited him to St Andrews to collect the bottle and see for himself where it eventually surfaced .
Donald threw his message in a bottle into the sea at the Sandside beach in Deerness on Orkney .
Written inside was a note asking the finder to pass it on to a boy of a similar age .
Today 33 year old Donald recalls regularly going down to the beach as a young boy with his mum , who encouraged him to throw hundreds of bottles into the sea over the years - even now , she continues the tradition at the same beach with her grandchildren .
When contacted by the organisers , Donald said , " Over the years I 've had a few replies , usually from Norway or Denmark , but never one from St Andrews and never one that 's taken this long to wash up . "
Almost sixty volunteers took part in the beach cleanup which filled 77 black bags of debris including nine pieces of wood , five litres of diesel in a plastic bottle , two fish crates , one barrel and a single Wellington boot .
The bottle was found by Mary Stevens ( pictured with Donal above ) , a mature student at the University and member of staff at ELT ( English Language Teaching ) .
It is hoped that the beach clean will become a bi-annual event , with another planned in October .
Roddy Yarr , Environment and Energy Manager for the University of St Andrews said , " The summer event was the first in a series that we hope will be part of a long - term effort to promote the importance of keeping the town 's beaches clean .
By involving local business , we hope that in the future local groups will be given their own slice of beach to look after .
" The message in a bottle was really quite a find and surprised us all , and we 're delighted to be able to reunite the owner with this piece of history .
It really is quite remarkable that the bottle should be found after all this time - who knows where it has travelled to in the last quarter of a decade . "

Borealis , Borouge and Itochu have announced that they have establish a strategic collaboration aimed at introducing renewable polypropylene in the form of consumer and other products to the Japanese market .
During a keynote last night at the OSCON open source convention in Portland , Ubuntu founder and Canonical CEO Mark Shuttleworth affirmed that the Launchpad project hosting platform developed by his company will likely be released under an open source license within the next year .
Although the timeline is still tentative , he articulated a clear commitment to follow through with the plan .
" We will release the source code within the next twelve months , " he said during his presentation .
The proprietary status of Launchpad has long been a point of contention in the open source community .
Some critics have characterized the closed source development of the platform as hypocritical , and a deviation from the company 's stated values .
Shuttleworth said last year that opening Launchpad is part of the company 's long - term strategy , but that it could n't be done until there was a clear revenue model for paying its developers .
The lack of a clear timeline has contributed to skepticism and doubt .
Several pieces , including the Storm object - relational mapping framework , have already been opened , but little has been said over the past year about the plan for opening the rest .
That changed last night when Shuttleworth disclosed his plans for getting the source code out to the community within a year .
The public availability of the Launchpad source code will help to accelerate development and adoption of the service and will likely eliminate the trepidation that has discouraged some members of the open source community from using it for their own projects in the past .
As I noted in my recent coverage of the Launchpad user interface overhaul , it 's already a much better service than competing closed - source project hosting services like Sourceforge and Google Code .
An open code base will make Launchpad even more appealing and make it possible for the broader community to help take it to the next level .
The Daedalus star ship , proposed in the 1970s , would propel itself forward using controlled fusion explosions and would take 50 years to reach Barnard 's Star , nearly 6 light years away .

Many believe that humanity 's destiny lies with the stars .
Sadly for us , rocket propulsion experts now say we may never even get out of the Solar System .
At a recent conference , rocket scientists from NASA , the U.S. Air Force and academia doused humanity 's interstellar dreams in cold reality .
The scientists , presenting at the Joint Propulsion Conference in Hartford , Connecticut , analyzed many of the designs for advanced propulsion that others have proposed for interstellar travel .
The calculations show that , even using the most theoretical of technologies , reaching the nearest star in a human lifetime is nearly impossible .
" In those cases , you are talking about a scale of engineering that you can't even imagine , " Paulo Lozano , an assistant professor of aeronautics and astronautics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a conference attendee , said in a recent interview .
The major problem is that propulsion – shooting mass backwards to go forwards – requires large amounts of both time and fuel .
For instance , using the best rocket engines Earth currently has to offer , it would take 50,000 years to travel the 4.3 light years to Alpha Centauri , our solar system 's nearest neighbor .
Even the most theoretically efficient type of propulsion , an imaginary engine powered by antimatter , would still require decades to reach Alpha Centauri , according to Robert Frisbee , group leader in the Advanced Propulsion Technology Group within NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory .
And then there 's the issue of fuel .
It would take at least the current energy output of the entire world to send a probe to the nearest star , according to Brice N. Cassenti , an associate professor with the Department of Engineering and Science at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute .
That 's a generous figure :
More likely , Cassenti says , it would be as much as 100 times that .
" We just ca n't extract the resources from the Earth , " Cassenti said during his presentation .
" They just do n't exist .
We would need to mine the outer planets . "
A 160 - Million - Ton Needle
Interstellar propulsion systems are not a new idea .
Rocket scientists , aeronautical engineers and science - fiction enthusiasts have proposed such designs for several decades .
In 1958 , U.S. scientists explored the possibility of a spaceship propelled by dropping nuclear bombs out the back , a so - called nuclear - pulsed rocket .
The research , called Project Orion , was killed by the signing of the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty and the budgetary requirements of the Apollo Project .
In 1978 , the British Interplanetary Society designed a mission to Barnard 's Star , almost 6 light years away , using a pulsed fusion rocket fueled by deuterium .
Building such a spaceship would require mining the outer planets for fuel for at least two decades , scientists said at the Joint Propulsion Conference this year .
But the thought experiments continue .
At the conference , Frisbee presented a theoretical design for a ship using antimatter to propel its way to nearby stars .
Frisbee 's design calls for a long , needle - like spaceship with each component stacked in line to keep radiation from the engines from harming sensitive equipment or people .
At the rocket end , a large superconducting magnet would direct the stream of particles created by annihilating hydrogen and antihydrogen .
A regular nozzle could not be used , even if made of exotic materials , because it could not withstand exposure to the high - energy particles , Frisbee said .
A heavy shield would protect the rest of the ship from the radiation produced by the reaction .
A large radiator would be placed next in line to dissipate all the heat produced by the engine , followed by the storage compartments for the hydrogen and antihydrogen .
Because antihydrogen would be annihilated if it touched the walls of any vessel , Frisbee 's design stores the two components as ice at one degree above absolute zero .
The systems needed to run the spacecraft come after the propellant tanks , followed by the payload .
In its entirety , the spaceship would resemble a large needle massing 80 million metric tons with another 40 million metric tons each of hydrogen and antihydrogen .
In contrast , the Space Shuttle weighs in at a mere 2,000 metric tons .
" Interstellar missions are big , " Frisbee said , in part because of the massive amounts of energy ( and hence fuel ) required to get moving fast enough to make the trip in anything like a reasonable amount of time .
" Any time you try to get something up to the speed of light , Newton is still God . "
With that fuel , it would still take nearly 40 years to travel the 4.3 light years to Earth 's nearest neighbor , Alpha Centuri , he said .
Down and Out On Earth
Even improving humans ' access to near space is not easy .
Scientists have all but discarded ideas for rockets that can reach orbit using a single stage .
Instead , private space ventures have focused on lightening the payload and rocket and on increasing reliability .
If space tourism comes into vogue , then launch providers could benefit from economies of scale .
But alternative - propulsion systems ?
They are not in short supply in people 's imaginations , but most fail the test of reality , Marcus Young , a researcher at the U.S. Air Force Research Lab's Advanced Project Group , told conference attendees .
Young and his team surveyed ideas for launch vehicles that could be accomplished in the next 15 to 50 years and found most to be unworkable .
Space elevator ?
Even if the engineering made sense , the design requires a breakthrough in materials science to create cables long and strong enough .
Rail guns ?
A vehicle would have to shoot down a 100 - kilometer track at 50 times the force of gravity to achieve orbit .
Nuclear power ?
Radioactivity would limit its use to outside Earth 's atmosphere , and the politics are positively toxic .
" There are a lot of ideas that initially you say , ' Hey , that might work , ' " Young said .
" But after a little research , you quickly find that it wo n't . "
Yet , just because science fiction is not yet a reality is not a reason to make science suffer , said MIT 's Lozano .
" There is a lot of interesting stuff that you can not do even in the solar system , " he said .
" We have the technical means to do it .
But some of the most sophisticated technologies ... we have not developed .
Not because we can't , but because we have not made it a priority . "
As for interstellar travel , even the realists are far from giving up .
All it takes is one breakthrough to make the calculations work , Frisbee said .
" It 's always science fiction until someone goes out and does it , " he said .

Texas regulators have approved a $ 4.93 billion wind - power transmission project , providing a major lift to the development of wind energy in the state .
The planned web of transmission lines will carry electricity from remote western parts of the state to major population centers like Dallas , Houston , Austin and San Antonio .
The lines can handle 18,500 megawatts of power , enough for 3.7 million homes on a hot day when air - conditioners are running .
The project will ease a bottleneck that has become a major obstacle to development of the wind - rich Texas Panhandle and other areas suitable for wind generation .
Texas is already the largest producer of wind power , with 5,300 installed megawatts  more than double the installed capacity of California , the next closest state .
And Texas is fast expanding its capacity .
Las Vegas - The Electronic Frontier Foundation ( EFF ) today launches its Coders ' Rights Project -- a new initiative to protect programmers and developers from legal threats hampering their cutting - edge research .
In conjunction with the project 's launch , EFF is staffing an " EFF Is In " booth at Black Hat USA 2008 in Las Vegas on August 6 and 7 .
At the booth , EFF attorneys will provide legal information on reverse engineering , vulnerability reporting , and copyright law , as well as patent , trade secret , and free speech issues .
" Coders who explore technology through innovation and research play a vital role in developing and securing the software and hardware we use everyday .
Yet this important work can be stymied by bogus legal threats , " said EFF Civil Liberties Director Jennifer Granick , who is heading up the project .
" EFF 's Coders ' Rights Project will provide a front - line defense for coders facing legal challenges for legitimate research activities . "
The Coders ' Rights Project will build upon EFF 's long history of work to limit the anti-circumvention provisions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ( DMCA ) from reaching security and encryption researchers .
EFF will also expand its involvement in matters involving the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act and state computer crime laws .
Additionally , EFF has created resources for programmers doing work involving reverse engineering and vulnerability reporting , available at http://eff.org/coders.
" Those of us doing research on computer security and privacy need to be able to discuss and publish our work without fear of legal threats , " said EFF Board Member Edward W. Felten , a security researcher and Princeton University professor who challenged provisions of the DMCA with EFF in 2001 .
" The Coders ' Rights Project will give critical legal help to programmers and developers who do the hard work in keeping technology robust and users safe . "
Other goals of the Coders ' Rights Project include narrowing computer crime laws and limiting the power of End User License Agreements ( EULAs ) to protect reverse engineering , reviews , benchmarking , and the consumer 's right to tinker .

In April , Apple filed an updated 52 - page application for a patent on an extensive multi- touch interface for a full Mac OS X - based system .
The illustrations that accompany the application look like the long - heralded but non-existent " iTablet . "
The filing includes descriptions of various interfaces , including a full - size onscreen keyboard that can use modifier keys , like shift or control .
" Although only two keys are described , it should be noted that two keys is not a limitation and that more than two keys may be actuated simultaneously to produce one or more control signals , " reads to the application .
So multiple modifiers can be used , such as shift - opt - ctrl - 3 , used to capture the screen to the pasteboard .
Another interface element is a virtual iPod scroll wheel that can be accessed on demand .
Like the iPod 's scroll wheel , it can be used as a virtual jog dial and be tied to a number of possible adjustments .
Other multi - touch gestures we have seen in the iPhone UI and carried over to the MacBook Air trackpad , such as scrolling , zooming , and rotation , are also described in the patent application .
Perhaps most importantly , however , the application details methods to interact with multiple windows , instead of the single window method used for the iPhone .
There are gestures that enable windows to be shuffled around and resized .
Also included in the description is a method to interact with interface widgets that may be too small , by temporarily enlarging them for accurate touch control .
The latest patent filing details methods for interacting
with multiple windows using multitouch input
The recent application follows on numerous patent applications from Apple recently , giving further evidence that Apple has some plans to integrate multi- touch interfaces in future Macs .
Whether or not this means we will be seeing a Mac tablet from Apple anytime soon , though , is still a mystery .
There is a small , but vocal , contingency hoping for such a product .
But based on comments from Axiotron CEO Andreas Haas , a former Apple product manager , it likely wo n't come from Apple until it sees a much larger market opportunity .
" The iTablet is not gonna come , " Haas told Ars in January .
" We are shipping [ ModBooks ] in the hundreds of thousands , and Apple ships in the millions . "
Until Apple thinks it can move that many tablets , it still remains a pipe dream .

What do we want ?
George Bush .
What do we get ?
A no-show
Inside apparently it was informal and relaxed , as George Bush arrived at Downing Street for a private dinner hosted by Gordon Brown and attended by Rupert Murdoch , a clutch of ministers and a mini-faculty of historians .
But out on the streets of Westminster , it was an edgier affair , as police in riot gear faced down protesters determined once again to voice their anger at the arrival in Britain of the US president .
Crowds often turn out in Britain for the farewell tours of famous American names and yesterday was no exception .
Some 2,500 had gathered in Parliament Square hours before the big event was due to start , and there plenty of T - shirts and memorabilia on sale .
But despite non -stop chants of his name , the star of the show made no appearance in front of the crowds .
The fact that the chants were " George Bush terrorist " and " Arrest George Bush " may have had something to do with it .
Certainly the noise was loud enough to be heard above the polite conversation 200 yards away at 10 Downing Street .
The trouble began after a few cans and placards were lobbed over police lines .
Several protesters were injured in the clashes and 25 were arrested .
Protesters blamed the authorities for not allowing a letter to be handed in to Downing Street .
Police blamed demonstrators for trying to dismantle barriers .
Numbers may have been fewer than those that greeted Bush on his November 2003 visit to London , when anger over the Iraq war was still raw .
But every generation was represented yesterday , from babies wearing " Arrest Bush " stickers , to Tony Benn who left behind his parliamentary career to " spend more time in politics " .
Before things turned ugly , the mood was vibrant .
Whistles were blown , drums were banged , and some carried handcuffs on the off - chance that Bush might present himself for a citizen 's arrest .
" The war in Iraq was a war crime , " said Benn .
" Over 1 million Iraqis have died and the Americans are spending $ 400 m a day on it while people are starving in Ethiopia . "
But nor was the past forgotten .
A loudspeaker played Love is All You Need and one T - shirt read : " I still hate Thatcher . "
Home Arrows generalise monads and idioms Lindley , Wadler & Yallop , 2008 .
The Arrow Calculus , ( Functional Pearl ) ( submitted to ICFP ) .
Lindley , Wadler & Yallop , 2008 .
Idioms are oblivious , arrows are meticulous , monads are promiscuous ( submitted to MSFP )
We revisit the connection between three notions of computation : Moggiâ€™s monads , Hughesâ€™s arrows and McBride and Patersonâ€™s idioms ( also called applicative functors ) .
We show that idioms are equivalent to arrows that satisfy the type isomorphism A ∼> B ≅ 1 ∼> ( A -> B ) and that monads are equivalent to arrows that satisfy the type isomorphism A ∼> B ≅ A â† ’ ( 1 ∼> B ) .
Further , idioms embed into arrows and arrows embed into monads .
The first paper introduce a reformulation of the Power / Thielecke / Paterson / McBride axiomatisation of arrows , which the authors argue is more natural , and shows that arrows generalise both monads and idioms .
The second paper studies the relationships between the three formalisations in more formal depth ; in particular the results about applicative functors struck me as significant .

When I met with Nicholas Negroponte not long ago , he laughed at the coverage he'd received through the past few years , including our own portrayal of Intel chairman Craig Barrett and him as Beavis and Butthead .
Far more hurtful have been the admonitions of his own former staffers who feel he has mismanaged the OLPC project .
Nearly every one of the original staff had abandoned the project by 2008 , often in disgust .
But Negroponte remains stalwart : " My elephant skin is the thickness of steel , " he told me .
Perhaps his resistance to criticism has been one of the project 's fatal flaws .

Although the project seemed threatened in early 2006 from all sides these were minor compared to the problems to come .
The biggest concern at the time was lack of an LCD panel manufacturer , but Negroponte and CTO Mary Lou Jepsen managed to charm another eccentric Taiwanese billionaire .
Wen - Long Hsu — founder of southern Taiwan 's Chi-Mei conglomerate — is the owner of the world 's largest collection of Stradivarius violins , and he played one for them when they visited to sign contracts .

By the fall , everything was working great in prototype form .
Quanta agreed to run its first batch , and even agreed to run a suspend - resume hibernation test cycle 1000 times on each test machine .
Normally , test units were give this cycle four times , so it was a particularly unusual request .
Then , at 3 am on the first day of mass production , Jepsen got a call .
Everything was shut down ; the laptops were going to sleep and not waking up .
" All hell was breaking loose . "
She hauled ass to the manufacturing lab with a few other guys and started pumping the caffeine .

Eventually a Quanta guy named Gary Chang and an OLPC guy named Richard Smith ( " He 's from Arkansas , looks like surfer dude " ) solved the problem .
" We were calling it the second shot from the grassy knoll , " says Jepsen .
Apparently , as the system was shutting down , electromagnetic noise was corrupting data , screwing up the instructions that told the thing how to wake up again .
At around the same time , the maker of the wireless chips , Marvell , decided to update the firmware for the radio , and they started to crash .
" We had four people in four time zones working on that problem , " said networking engineer Michail Bletsas .
" Mark Foster in Taipei , me in Boston , someone in India , and someone in Santa Clara .
We had to program a workaround on the fly :
It 's in the radio , something you 're not supposed to touch under normal consequences . "

" A lot of those stories were n't told , " says Jepsen .
" We were n't hiding it , everybody knew , but we were n't broadcasting it .
We figured it all out , and shipped a million of them . "
Threat Level Rising
By late 2006 , Intel had finalized its specs for the Classmate PC .
Though it would cost $ 30 to $ 40 more than the XO — the " $ 100 laptop " in the end cost $ 188 — the Classmate had a faster processor , Intel brand equity and the option of Windows XP as the OS .
( Bulk buyers could also opt for Linux . )
It was seductive in that it was n't the revolutionary product that the XO was , but something more familiar , and in line with what ministers of education might have been considering already .
What 's more , it was a reference design that regional companies could license and customize to fit their needs .
And , perhaps , countries rife with pirated software infrastructure had plenty of free programs to run from the black market .

As it began pilot program , Intel 's strategy was seen as more traditional too : Laptops could go to teachers , or loaned to students .
It did not enforce Negroponte 's logical but strict mandate , that the laptops be given to the children , and that they should only be deployed when there are enough to go around .
In the middle of 2007 , Intel and OLPC entered into a partnership that was probably more of a hindrance to each other 's initiatives than any sort of help .
From the start , the deal was vague , more of a mutual appreciation society than a true strategic alliance .
Six months later , it had dissolved in acrimony .
OLPC accused Intel of pitching Classmate to would - be XO customers ;
Intel griped that OLPC would n't stop asking that the Classmate be discontinued in favor of the XO .
Advertisement
Meanwhile , Intel 's more profit - minded operatives were hanging out in Taiwan , spinning the baby laptop idea to one of Quanta 's arch competitors , a little known company called Asus .
On June 8 , 2007 , while both the XO and the Classmate were still deep in pilot testing , Asus introduced the Eee PC , a $ 400 mini - notebook running a warm - n - fuzzy flavor of Linux .
Not only did it resemble the Classmate more than a little , it was unveiled at a press conference hosted by none other than Intel .
It would be ready for sale worldwide by that winter , and when it did become available , boy did it sell like hotcakes .
Sales Figures , Sales Facts
" Selling like hotcakes " is an expression that does n't mean anything in particular .
In many cases , " selling a million " does n't really mean anything specific either .
I 've heard OLPC people say they 've hit the million mark , but in terms of actual shipments , it 's not true .
Advertisement
Due to issues that have nothing to do with hardware — and largely to do with Negroponte 's greater mission of educating the world 's poor — the XO spent most of 2007 in beta testing .
In early November , OLPC launched the " Give 1 Get 1 " $ 400 charitable promotion for US buyers , but the first real bonafide XO deployment happened in Uruguay in on December 1 .
Confirmed orders might have topped a million at this point , but the number of existing XOs , both sold in the US and deployed en masse to schoolchildren in Peru and Uruguay , hovers around 500,000 .
Ask Intel how many Classmate PCs are out in the wild , and you get a vague stat , somewhere in the " hundreds of thousands . "
Intel , too , promises large numbers to come .
Portugal will be buying 500,000 of them for the coming school year , for instance .
Advertisement
The Eee PC , though , is already nearing 2 million sold , having hit 1.7 million in the first half of 2008 .
It is on target to reach a promised goal of 5 million by the end of the year .
( By contrast , OLPC will most assuredly not reach 1 million by the end of 2008 . )
The success of the mini notebooks has largely been due to price ( even expensive ones rarely touch $ 600 ) and their intentionally internet - friendly design ( you 're not going to load up Photoshop CS3 , but browsing and email checking work fine ) .
They are also boosted by the negativity surrounding Windows Vista :
By running Linux or Windows XP , they present a desirable alternative to the bulkier , more expensive , resource - heavy machines required to run Microsoft 's latest OS .

In the wake of the Eee 's success , over 40 mini notebooks have hit the market over night .
The top four best - selling notebooks on Amazon fall into this catetgory .

At this point , even if the millions of third - world students eventually get laptops , it 's unlikely that the XO will be the one they receive .
Still , the past two years are definitive proof that Negroponte can take credit for the birth of an entirely new kind of PC .
Advertisement
And Negroponte does claim credit for the Eee PC 's success .
In fact , he says it's why he introduced the next version of the XO laptop — a radical two - touchscreen device aimed at a $ 75 pricetag — so early .
Encore ?
I asked him why , with the first XO so clearly in its early stages of shipment , would he show off the XO - 2 .
Sure , he does n't have customers at Best Buy who may hold off because they know what 's coming , but it seemed to take away from the momentum of the original device , not to mention confirming some of its criticisms ( underpowered , cramped keyboard , etc. ) .

" When we announce something now that will be in play two years from now , it 's partly to give the manufacturers something to start copying now , " he says , elaborating , " If you go back two years and you look at the press , [ the XO ] was dismissed , it was not possible .
Then came the Classmate , then Asus .
If I underestimated anything , it was how fast people would [ copy ] it , even if they did n't get down to the same price or did n't have the same features .
It was a movement — a hardware trend — that happened because of OLPC . "
He also hopes that the announcement of the XO - 2 concept , one that only exists in pictures , will stimulate small developers who work on components .
Jepsen 's new company Pixel Qi will focus on the next - generation of LCD touchscreen , one that can be made as cheaply as current screens today , but have capacitive touch built right into the active matrix , making it thinner than an iPhone screen .
Others who saw the XO - 2 renderings have already begun pitching solutions to the group .

Not a Manager
If there 's one criticism made against Negroponte that 's indisputable , is that he changes his tune .
In the beginning , Negroponte repeatedly affirmed that the XO was to run " Linux or some other open source operating system . "
After a long struggle that could easily be the subject of another series , the XO has recently been made capable of booting both its own Linux OS with Sugar interface , as well as Windows XP .
( Critics say that Negroponte never allowed OLPC's Linux OS to mature so that it could stand up to pressure from the Windows advocates . )
Advertisement
Likewise , he was adamant at the beginning that his laptop be the only one shipped to these third - world educational programs where there is n't so much a " market " as there is a case for charity .
He says now that if there is a true market — schools and families with the means and desire to buy their own laptops — others can serve it .
Inside OLPC , the leader 's mercurial nature and changing priorities proved too much for the talent he had assembled .
On the software side , Walter Bender and Ivan Krstic left after open disagreements with Negroponte — mostly pertaining to the adoption of Windows , but also to the overall goals of the program .
Jepsen left in January 2008 in what she says was an amicable split , though other hardware experts including laptop maestro Mark Foster had abandoned ship earlier , possibly because they could n't get along with Jepsen .
Most people seem rankled by the credit that Yves Behar took as the " OLPC designer , " most notably in a Wired article that would seem laughable to anyone who read Part 1 and Part 2 of this series .
Advertisement
When talking to staff members , there is a sense that no one really got along , and that the religion that Negroponte had instilled in his lieutenants , enough to get them to hang together for two years , has dissipated .
The rocky Intel alliance and the move toward Windows were just the final disillusionments .
Negroponte spoke the painfully obvious to BusinessWeek last March : " I am not a CEO .
Management , administration and details are my weaknesses . "

Pulling an Obi-Wan
Still , Negroponte and whoever has stuck by him charge onward .
He said , to us and to others , " OLPC is not a laptop company . "
He himself said that to be taken seriously , you have to build hundreds of thousands of laptops every month ; Quanta currently outputs a reliable stream of around 50,000 per month .
Now that the mini - notebook movement is in full swing commercially , perhaps the focus should veer from hardware development .
Why then stay in the hardware game ?
Perhaps it 's telling that , on the OLPC website 's own " Progress " page , nothing is mentioned after December 2007 .
Bletsas — who remains hard at work on OLPC today — says that if OLPC does not stay in business , the laptop makers who followed the XO design cues will start doing what they do best : bumping the specs , upping the prices and keeping product too expensive for the foundation to use it in its educational mission .
" Unless we keep designing , showing the world it 's doable , I do n't think they will follow in that path , " he says .
" If we stop at this stage , they are not going to come down enough for us to use their machines .
We have to push them at least one step further . "

BEIJING  A terrorist group seeking an independent Muslim state in western China has released a video threatening an attack on the Olympic Games here , according to an American organization that tracks terrorist Internet posts .
The video ’s opening graphics show a burning Olympic logo and an explosion superimposed over one of the athletic sites , said the monitoring organization , IntelCenter , based in Alexandria , Va .
According to IntelCenter ’s description , a man holding an assault rifle , who identifies himself as Abdullah Mansour , says in the Uighur language : “ We , members of the Turkestan Islamic Party , have declared war against China .
We oppose China ’s occupation of our homeland of East Turkestan , which is a part of the Islamic world . ”
He warns Muslims not to go to the Games and not to let their children go .
“ We do not want to see any Muslim brothers and sisters who believe in Allah and his Holy Prophet Muhammad , who believe in the next life and the day of judgment , get hurt by our fire targeted at China , ” he says .
DENVER , Colorado ( CNN ) -- Sen. Barack Obama laid out his plan for change in America as he accepted the Democratic presidential nomination Thursday night , securing his place in history as the first African - American to lead a major party ticket .
Sen . Barack Obama accepted his party 's nomination for the presidency Thursday night .

" Change happens because the American people demand it -- because they rise up and insist on new ideas and new leadership , a new politics for a new time .
America , this is one of those moments , " he told supporters at the Democratic National Convention .
" I believe that as hard as it will be , the change we need is coming . "
Obama pitted himself against John McCain , repeatedly countering attacks from his Republican rival while casting the election as a choice between change and failure , as he addressed tens of thousands of cheering people and millions of primetime TV viewers .
McCain would continue the policies of the Bush administration , Obama said .
" We are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look just like the last eight .
On November 4 , we must stand up and say : ' Eight is enough , ' " he told the Denver throng .
In addition to slamming McCain on Iraq , energy policy and health care , Obama said his rival for the White House is out of touch with the concerns of the average American .
Watch Obama 's entire speech : Part 1 » | Part 2 »
" He said that our economy has made ' great progress ' under this president .
He said that the fundamentals of the economy are strong .
And when one of his chief advisers -- the man who wrote his economic plan -- was talking about the anxiety Americans are feeling , he said that we were just suffering from a ' mental recession , ' and that we 've become , and I quote , ' a nation of whiners , ' " Obama said , eliciting boos from the crowd .
" It 's not because John McCain does n't care , " Obama said .
" It 's because John McCain does n't get it . "
Watch Obama blast the status quo »
The speech marked the culmination of the four - day convention in Denver , during which party leaders pushed to heal the rift from a bitter and prolonged primary battle between Obama and Sen. Hillary Clinton .
By Thursday , Obama had received clear endorsements from Clinton and her husband former President Bill Clinton .
Watch highlights from the convention »
By early evening , the line of people seeking to get into Invesco Field to hear Obama 's address stretched for six miles , and the crowd that filled the stadium was more than 80,000 strong .
" I stand before you tonight because all across America something is stirring , " Obama told the audience .
" What the naysayers do n't understand is that this election has never been about me .
It 's about you . "
Watch Obama accept the historic nomination »
In a statement issued immediately after the speech , the McCain campaign called the speech " misleading " and said it was " fundamentally at odds with the meager record of Barack Obama . "
" When the temple comes down , the fireworks end , and the words are over , the facts remain : Sen .
Obama still has no record of bipartisanship , still opposes offshore drilling , still voted to raise taxes on those making just $ 42,000 per year , and still voted against funds for American troops in harm 's way .
The fact remains : Barack Obama is still not ready to be president , " said a statement from the campaign .
The " temple " is a reference to the columns that formed the backdrop for Obama 's speech .
Grade Obama 's speech
Obama also outlined his promises for the nation -- vowing to cut taxes , end the country 's dependence on oil from the Middle East and offer affordable healthcare for all Americans .
He also pledged to end the war in Iraq responsibly , and " finish the fight against al Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan . "

He wrapped up his speech by telling the crowd , " America , we can not turn back .
We can not walk alone .
At this moment , in this election , we must pledge once more to march into the future . "
Watch as fireworks mark the end of the convention »
The crowd gave Obama a roaring welcome and met lines of his speech with chants of his catchphrase , " Yes , we can . "
Many political pundits said Obama hit it out of the park with his nearly 50 - minute speech , and those in attendance agreed .

" It was an excellent home run , " said Matt Besser , an Obama representative to the DNC platform committee .
" He did everything he needed to do .
He gracefully dissected John McCain and then set out his own vision , and clearly everyone got it . "
In the hours leading up to the speech , a star - studded line up of musicians performed , including Stevie Wonder , John Legend , Sheryl Crow and Will.i.am .

The scene was much like a rock concert , with the foot - stomping , flag - waving crowd dancing and bouncing beach balls as they awaited Obama 's arrival .
When Obama officially locked in his party 's nomination on Wednesday , delegates sobbed , cheered and hugged in celebration of the historic moment .
The Democratic candidate 's address fell on the 45th anniversary of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s " I have a dream " speech .
In an emotional tribute to the slain civil rights leader earlier in the evening , King 's children paid respect to their father and said he would have been proud of the party and the generation that would realize his dream .
Civil rights hero Rep. John Lewis and Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. , son of civil rights leader Jesse Jackson , were seen hugging each other and weeping .
McCain also honored Obama 's achievement in a television ad that aired during the convention .
Earlier in the evening , former presidential candidate Al Gore turned the focus to the environment , an issue that received little attention earlier in the week .
He also invoked the bitterly disputed 2000 presidential election to argue that Americans should elect Obama in November .
Read about Gore 's address
" Eight years ago , some said there was not much difference between the nominees of the two major parties and it did n't really matter who became president , " he told delegates .
" But here we all are in 2008 , and I doubt anyone would argue now that election did n't matter , " he said .
Next week , it 's the Republicans turn .
Their four - day convention gets underway Monday in Minneapolis - St. Paul , Minnesota .

" Any person subject to this chapter who , in breach of an allegiance or duty to the United States , knowingly and intentionally aids an enemy of the United States , or one of the co-belligerents of the enemy , shall be punished as a military commission under this chapter may direct . "
I remember saying the Pledge of Allegiance as a schoolboy .
I did n’t fully understand what some of these concepts referred to : the words “ liberty ” and “ justice ” , for example , are very abstract ideas for a small boy .
But I had a warm feeling swearing my loyalty to the United States , to God , to liberty and justice .
Now , many years later , I know what liberty and justice are .
I have come to see how important -- and rare -- those ideals are .
And I have learned the entire history of the U.S. , both good and bad .
I have learned of her honorable and selfless actions .
I have also learned about her brutally deceitful and murderous actions , including the frequent use by our government of false flag terror .
But even after learning of all of the deceit and murder committed by our government , I still have strong positive feelings for the United States .
My forefathers fought and died for liberty .
My ancestors struggled to deliver a nation ruled by laws and justice , instead of by the whims of men .
My people gave their blood , sweat and tears to throw off the yoke of the British monarchy and to defeat the ambitions of Hitler , Mussolini and Hirohito in World War II .
And so – even after the Iraq war , and the destruction of New Orleans , and the spying and torture scandals , and the vote fraud , and 9/11 and all of the other false flag attacks carried out by by the government over the years - I am willing to pledge my allegiance to the United States of America .
Because - as sick and twisted and amoral as she may have become in recent years - I still hold out hope that we may again decide to get back to the great work at hand , the “ grand experiment ” of self - government and democracy .
Why not support some other form of government , you might ask ?
Well , no matter what “ ism ” one tries - socialism , communism , etc. - the government will only be as good or as bad as the people that run it , and their adherence to the ideals upon which it is founded .
For example , I personally think any Americans still calling themselves communists are ridiculous , because that whole form of government has been tried and it failed miserably : its leaders were corrupt and brutally repressive ( Russia 's Stalin and the current Chinese leadership , for example , are some of the worst the world has seen ) .
And the American system is clearly imperfect , even on paper .
For example , I believe that European - style proportional representation would be better than the current winner - take - all system , since it allows third parties to have some seats in Congress , and thus breaks the 2 - party monopoly we see in the U.S.
I also believe that , when the Founding Fathers adopted the idea of separation of powers from the Iroquois constitution , they forgot some of the most important parts .
But the Constitutional system we have in America is basically a good system , and – as shown by the recent shenanigans by those currently in the White House and Congress - system , no matter how good it looks on paper , can be subverted by bad people .
The U.S. system is as good a starting point as any .
And - with good leadership - it has at times been a great system .
And it could be again .
So I WILL pledge my allegiance to the ideals of the United States of America .
But I will not pledge my allegiance to George W. Bush and his band of truly un - American wanna - be fascists .
These people want to trash the Constitution which they are sworn to uphold and defend .
These people want to defile the graves of the Founding Fathers in order to destroy our democratic republic , and turn America into a tin - pot dictatorship .
Leaders are only as good as the faithfulness with which they follow their nation 's common ideals .
These people dopledge their allegiance to America , and so I do not pledge my allegiance to them .
I call on all Americans to pledge their allegiance to the Constitution , but not to the usurpers and pretenders who are hell - bent on destroying it .
I also remind the good and honorable people in the military remember -- especially those in leadership positions and also those who come from military families -- that they have sworn an oath to protect and defend the U.S. from all enemies , foreign .
I pray that they remember that they have sworn their allegiance to the ideals of the Constitutional form of government which their ancestors fought so hard - and , in many cases , made the ultimate sacrifice - to defend .
If those who never served a day in the military - the people who got us into the messes in Vietnam and Iraq , who have destroyed the reputation of the U.S. , and who have created many more terrorists than they have killed - are calling on you to do something which will fundamentallythe security of the United States , such as invading a foreign country which has not attacked the U.S. first , or helping to carry out a false flag attack on Americans , then you must decide whether such act is contrary to your solemn oaths .
If you decide that it is ( and how can you not ? ) , then you must act appropriately .
Similarly , if you are asked to torture ansolely because he or she is criticizing the current administration or its policies or working for liberty and justice , you must ask yourself whether you wish to be a good little soldier " just following orders " , like the Nazi police did .
If you think I 'm being overly - dramatic , please note that the newly - passed torture law states :
According to a Yale law professor , " The [ torture ] legislation .... authorizes the president to seize American citizens as enemy combatants , even if they have never left the United States .
And once thrown into military prison , they cannot expect a trial by their peers or any other of the normal protections of the Bill of Rights . "
According to the New York Times , the legislation introduced , " A dangerously broad definition of “ illegal enemy combatant ” in the bill could subject legal residents of the United States , as well as foreign citizens living in their own countries , to summary arrest and indefinite detention with no hope of appeal .
The president could give the power to apply this label to anyone he wanted . "
And according to another law school professor , " Anyone who donates money to a charity that turns up on Bush 's list of ' terrorist ' organizations , or who speaks out against the government 's policies could be declared an ' unlawful enemy combatant ' and imprisoned indefinitely .
That includes American citizens . "
And even peace protestors are being labelled as " terrorists " .
And given that the White House 's National Strategy for Combating Terrorism labels " conspiracy theorists " as terrorist recruiters , just about anyone who says that 2 or more people within the Bush administration have done anything wrong could conceivably be labelled an enemy combatant .
And that 's all before even discussing the " Homegrown Terrorism " act .
It is time for all of us , civilian and military , to remember that our pledge of allegiance , our sworn oath , is to the Constitution , and not to the Commander in Chief and his compadres .
The Commander in Chief is only legitimate to the extent that he follows the Constitution .
His orders must be disobeyed to the extent that they are contrary to the Constitution , and certainly if they will undermine the security and defense of the country in the short or long - run .
And when the President has breached his allegiance and duty to the United States , when he is acting like a domestic enemy of the Constitution , then he should be given about as much legitimacy as Pol Pot , Idi Amin , or Saddam Hussein would be given if they ran for President of the United States of America .
It is time to remember the pledge of allegiance , and to reflect on its true meaning .
And then to act to uphold our pledge and sworn oath , and to save the United States of American from its so - called leaders .
As far as I am aware , I am a mentally healthy , well - adjusted , and sane person with no disorders .
But I have a strange , fairly innocuous quirk which seems beyond my control and I 'm curious about it ...
When I think of / remember something embarrassing from my life , I compulsively make some kind of noise .
It seems to happen unconsciously , before my censor can catch it and stop myself ( it even happens when I am in a quiet or inappropriate place ) .
It 's not especially loud , in fact it 's often under my breath .
The sound is usually just a quiet grunt , or a word / syllable or two .
If I remember an embarrassing conversation , I tend to blurt out a random word of the conversation ( as in , I 'm replaying the dialogue in my head but then all the sudden one of the words pops out of my mouth ) .
If it happens while I 'm reading , I tend to blurt out one or two of the words that happen to be under my eyes at the moment .
It usually only happens when I 'm remembering something palpably embarrassing or humiliating from my life -- not for mild everyday kind of stuff .
( Again , I had a fairly happy childhood and have nothing particularly traumatic in my past -- I do n't think my embarrassing memories are any worse than the average joe's )
So what is this , do I have some kind of low - grade tourette 's syndrome ?
Is there a name for this phenomenon ?
Does it happen to others or is it unique to me ?
What 's with my weird compulsion ?
Time was , you could open up an email in your favourite email client and read it without too many concerns about how that email was constructed .
But times change , or so it would seem ...
My pain of the moment is the abuse of the " multipart / alternative " version of multi- type emails .
Specifically the almost complete absence of valid textual - alternatives in these emails .
Just to recap - RFC 2046 section 5.1.4 ( Alternative Subtype ) states that :
5.1.4 . Alternative Subtype The " multipart / alternative " type is syntactically identical to " multipart / mixed " , but the semantics are different .
In particular , each of the body parts is an " alternative " version of the same information .
Systems should recognize that the content of the various parts are interchangeable .
Systems should choose the " best " type based on the local environment and references , in some cases even through user interaction .
As with " multipart / mixed " , the order of body parts is significant .
In this case , the alternatives appear in an order of increasing faithfulness to the original content .
In general , the best choice is the LAST part of a type supported by the recipient ...
I 've long since given up configuring my email client ( mutt ) to indicate that text is the preferred type .
The number of emails that arrive claiming to have " multipart / alternative " sections but which contain only " Your email client cannot read this email " in the text section finally meant that I had to process the HTML email sections instead .
I 've almost grudgingly accepted that as just the way it is - but an email I received today tipped the scales .
It read ( start to finish ) :
[ emailer_top ] [ emailer_bottom ]
I checked the email - nothing but that and a PDF attached .
I tried viewing the email with a different client and finally realised that the entire text of the email was embedded in images !
The email was a " multipart / alternative " - but the text section read :
This message is in MIME format .
Since your mail reader does not understand this format , some or all of this message may not be legible .
Superb ...
So this is just a plea into the void - when anyone receives such emails contact the sender and tell them what 's wrong .
If you know that you or your organisation are responsible for such emails being sent - STOP DOING IT .
( please ! )
Researchers in Germany , Switzerland , and the United States have shown , for the first time , that an extremely fast climate change occurred in Western Europe .
This took place long before human - made changes in the atmosphere , and is causatively associated with a sudden change in the wind systems .
The research , which appears in the journal Nature Geoscience , was conducted by geoscientists Achim Brauer , Peter Dulski and Jörg Negendank ( emeritus Professor ) from the GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences , Gerald Haug from the DFG - Leibniz Center for Surface Processes and Climate Studies at the University of Potsdam and the ETH in Zurich , and Daniel Sigman from Princeton University .
The proof of an extreme cooling within a short number of years 12,700 years ago was attained in sediments of the volcanic lake Meerfelder Maar in the Eifel region of Germany .
The seasonally layered deposits allow to precisely determine the rate of climate change .
With a novel combination of microscopic research studies and modern geochemical scanner procedures , the scientists were able to successfully reconstruct the climatic conditions even for individual seasons .
In particular , the changes in the wind force and direction during the winter half - year caused the climate to topple over into a completely different mode within one year after a short instable phase of a few decades .
Up to now , it was assumed that the attenuation of the Gulf Stream alone was responsible for the strong cooling in Western Europe .
The examined lake deposits show , however , that the atmospheric circulation , probably in connection with the spreading of sea-ice , most likely played a very important role .
At the same time , these new results show that the climate system is still not well understood , and that especially the mechanisms of short - term change and the time of occurrence still hold many puzzles .
Micro- layered lake deposits represent particularly suitable geological archives , with which scientists want to track down climate change .
Scientists from the Helmholtz Centre Potsdam – German Research Centre for Geosciences ( GFZ ) and other institutions are in search of such archives worldwide , with the hope of obtaining area - wide information on the dynamics of climate and possible regional variations in the future .
Winged cats have been known to exist since the 19th century , but only a handful of people have actually seen–let alone owned–one .
This woman in Sichuan province watched as her beloved kitty grew angel wings on his back last summer after a bunch of female cats tried to mate with him .
" Many female cats in heat came to harass him , and then the wings started to grow , " she said .
Geneticists have a less romantic theory .
They believe it could be a genetic defect , a skin condition , or the result of poor grooming .

The National Rifle Association said Wednesday that Barack Obama is trying to mislead voters about his past support of gun control , calling the Democratic candidate " a poster child of the extremist , elitist gun control movement . "
The group was responding to recent remarks by Montana Gov. Brian Schweitzer , a Democrat who supports gun rights and told reporters this week that Obama " ai n't ever going to take your gun away . "
Schweitzer , who has the NRA 's support in his re-election bid , added that there is little difference between the Democrat and Republican John McCain .
The NRA said Schweitzer was misrepresenting the candidates ' positions .
" To somehow suggest ( Obama ) is supportive of gun owners because he says so when he is in Montana running for president is absurd , " the NRA 's Chris W. Cox said in a telephone interview from Virginia .
" We are going to make sure that anybody that tells Montana gun owners that Barack Obama is not a threat to gun owners is exposed as someone who is not shooting straight . "
Schweitzer said Wednesday he stands by his comments .
The Obama campaign said Schweitzer was right on the mark , noting the governor had said Obama is more outspoken than McCain on protecting hunting access to public lands .
The Obama campaign has stressed to Western voters that the candidate 's support of " sensible " gun control wo n't get in the way of their traditions .
But it has not released specifics on what type of gun measures Obama would deem sensible .
Obama has hired a staff and is running campaign ads in his quest for Montana 's three electoral votes , hoping to be only the third Democratic presidential candidate to carry the state since 1948 .
The NRA plans to spend $ 40 million nationally this campaign season , and has yet to determine how much will be spent in individual states .
What ’s this ?
Dave Grohl just wrote to Metallica ?
That ’s right , former Nirvana drummer and current Foo Fighters frontman Dave Grohl has released an “ open letter ” to Metallica .
Call me an idiot , but there ’s only one reason he ’d do this – he ’s afraid it ’s going to suck .
OK , maybe suck is a harsh word … he ’s afraid the album they ’re going to release will not rise to it ’s potential ( are n’t we all ? ) .
Anyway , great letter , and I really hope he ’s right .
“ Dear Metallica ,
Hey , it ’s Dave !
Remember me ?
Yeah , I ’m the guy that ’s been listening to your band faithfully since 1983 .
I bought your first album ‘ Kill ‘ Em All ’ from a mailorder catalogue called Under The Rainbow , I think .
Actually I ca n’t remember .
It was 1983 for Christsakes !
But that album changed my life and I ’ve been listening to your albums ever since ( even ‘ St Anger ’ ! ) .
I ca n’t wait to hear the new shit , and no matter what you guys do I ’ll always be first one at the shop waiting to hear it .
I ’m sure you ’ll come out and blow everybody ’s fuckin’ minds , because you ’re fuckin’ Metallica !
Good luck .
And do n’t release it until it ’s kick - ass .
Yours , Dave Grohl .
P.S. Are you finished recording the drums yet ? ”
There are a few philosophical problems which occur spontaneously to people who know nothing of academic philosophy but have a naturally thoughtful inclination .
The problem of free will is one , I think , and probably so is qualia ; many people who never heard of David Chalmers sometimes ponder the ‘ hard question ’ , asking themselves how they know that the blue they see ‘ in their heads ’ is the same as the blue other people see .
David M. Black has put his finger on another of these problems in his paper on The Ownership of Consciousness .
Why am I me and not someone else ?
Black ’s main purpose lies elsewhere – he wants to suggest that talk of spirituality can be a valuable way of discussing structures in the subjective part of the world , complementing the reductive scientific account which deals with the objective aspects .
That ’s an attractive project ( though I think he allows himself too much too easily in assuming that subjective experience has causal effects ) .
But it was the issue posed by the title of the paper that particularly caught my attention .
Now of course , there is a sense in which this is is an absurd enquiry .
Whoever I am , that person is me : I ca n’t not be me , by definition .
Self and consciousness are intertwined , so that the ownership of my consciousness can never really be in doubt .
I am my consciousness .
It would make more sense to ask why I have this body than to ask why I have this consciousness .
So it might seem that the mystery of why I am who I am is really about on a par with the mystery of how I was lucky enough to be born on Earth , rather than on a planet without an atmosphere ; not really a mystery at all .
But suppose , we might say , we strip away the details of my body and my life and pare me down to the essential nub of experiencing entity .
What makes this nub any different from other such nubs , and why is it linked with the life of this particular human organism rather than any other ?
Some would say in response that there is no such nub ; it ’s exactly my history and my physical constitution that make my consciousness what it is ; so again it ’s no surprise , properly understood , that my experiences belong to me and not to anyone else .
Strip away all those supposedly inessential features , and you strip me away with them .
Others would accept that it ’s my history and composition that define me as me , but feel , possibly on the basis of introspection , that there still is something to me over and above all that .
They might find this final ingredient in an inscrutable panpsychic quality of matter itself ; others have suggested a kind of universal experiential substrate or background .
Instead of individual nubs , we have a kind of Universal self ; a line of thought which is highly compatible with some religious and mystical views .
However , I think both sides of this argument are missing the point .
To say that my individual consciousness arises from or is constituted by my physical nature and background is not actually to dispose of the essential problem at all , because my physical nature and background are also inexplicably particular .
Perhaps the underlying problem is the vexed question of why anything is anything in particular : it ’s just that in the case of my own experience and my own existence the question hits me with a force it lacks when I ’m merely wondering about a chair .
The basic problem is haecceity or thisness ( the same problem which in my view lies at the root of the qualia problem ) .
The difficulty of this issue is that it seems no kind of explanation will do .
One way to explain the arbitrary complexity of the world would be to assume that everything is really a logical necessity , so if we were clever enough we could deduce all truths from first principles , like Douglas Adams ’
Deep
Thought which , beginning with the cogito had got as far as deducing the existence of rice pudding and income tax before anyone could switch it off , if I remember correctly .
Even if we could pull off such staggering feats of deduction , the explanation is no good because if everything exists only by virtue of logical necessity everything exists in an eternal Platonic world , the opposite of the mutable diversity we set out to explain .
A more scientific view would have it that the current state of the world derives from previous states in accordance with the laws of physics , so that the explanation is essentially historical .
But this is no better .
We now have an expanded set of laws ; beside those of logic , we need those of mathematics and those of physics .
But they ’re still laws , so we ’re still Platonic and immutable unless some arbitrary graininess somehow crept in at the beginning of it all .
Nowadays we ’re readier to accept that huge chaotic complexity can arise out of small beginnings ; but not out of nothing .
Explaining that original graininess is as difficult as explaining the haecceity of the world was to start with .
And what about those laws of physics ?
Do they too reduce to logical or mathematical necessity , or is there some arbitrary element involved ; and if so , how do you explain that ?
One line we could take is to say that all the possible variations of the underlying constants are realized in some possible world .
The problem of how we got these particular laws of physics then turns into the same sort of vacuous problem as the ones mentioned above : if the laws were n’t like that , you would n’t be here to wonder about it .
But that ’s no good .
Even if we could get over the problems involved in the idea of parallel worlds , which seems to involve the problematic retention of identity between non-identical entities , how can we deal with the concept of all possible sets of laws of physics ?
Typically in these discussions it is assumed that we ’re talking about variations in the value of a few constants , but things are much worse than that .
Apart from the sheer bogglement of universes where the value of gravity is determined by quadripedal blurpton interactions in the trouser - pocket of fourth - order fried bread , if all possible sets of laws are realised , that includes universes whose laws and constitution are the same as ours up until 2009 , when the blurptons abruptly take over .
In short , anything could happen at any time ; to say that all possible laws of physics are realised in some universe is in effect to declare that there are no laws of physics and that everything happens arbitrarily .
That is another possible position , of course , though an utterly unsatisfactory one .
Taking a more traditional tack , we could say that the world is the way it is because of the will of God ; but for philosophers , that ’s no good .
We need to know whether God was working on logical principles , and if it was n’t pure logic , where did His axioms or His quirks of personality come from ?
In the last century it was finally established that there is something in maths that is n’t reducible to logic ; not much , but an essential little something which can be construed in different ways .
It seems to me that in the same way there ’s some fundamental element in metaphysics that is n’t any kind of law ; but I have no idea how to construe it at all .

At least one major right - wing smear attack on Obama may be gearing up .
I 'll call it the " Who Sent You " campaign .
As weird as it sounds -- and it is weird stuff -- the gist of it is that Obama 's birth was part of a secret plan by communists , Jews and one - worlders to take over the world .
As you read this it is going to sound so fanatically wingnut / John Birch Society / black helicopter / precious bodily fluids weird that you are likely to dismiss it as the rantings of crazy people .
But I have learned over the years that this stuff resonates with a certain crowd , and they are remarkably effective at tapping the fears of Americans .
Keep in mind how weird and unbelievable the Swift Boat accusations seemed -- and remember the powerful effect they had on the public and election results .
In The Swiftboaters Are Back in the Water I wrote about the effectiveness of the dishonest accusations ,
. . . [ one ] reason it works is because it is ( excuse the pun ) offensive .
They say that the best defense is a good offense , and considering their candidates , the Republicans certainly needed a defense . [. . .]
So with swiftboating you spread a smear to raise questions with the public about the opponent 's patriotism or service .
It does n't have to be true ( how quaint ) it just has to raise questions .
This " neutralizes " the honorable record of or otherwise " discredits " the advantages that opponent has against a Republican with a poor ( like George W. Bush 's ) or no ( like Saxby Chambliss or any number of other " chickenhawks " ) record .
That post also cited the following description of the results of that smear :
" A recent University of Pennsylvania poll showed that its attack ad questioning whether Kerry deserved his medals had been seen or heard of by half the voters questioned .
It also revealed that 44 per cent of independent voters found the advert at least somewhat believable .
Meanwhile a CBS poll showed the number of veterans who supported Kerry had dropped from 46 per cent to 37 per cent . " [ emphasis added ]
This effect increased as the election approached .
And here we are again .
The widely - spread , widely - repeated -- and consequently widely believed -- smear emails about Obama being a secret Muslim who went to a terrorist training school , burned his flag pin etc. have been " preparing the ground " by " raising questions " that get people ready to give a positive reception to this conspiracy theory .
I am seeing signs that the wingnuts are starting to roll out the next phase with the right 's recent " Obama forged birth certificate " blogswarm , with stories like this from Christian Web News ,
In response to mounting media questions about the failure of the Barack Obama presidential campaign to produce his birth certificate , an official spokesman of the campaign has endorsed as genuine the image of a document purporting to be his " birth certificate . "
However , experts who have examined that image in high resolution have pointed out inconsistencies and irregularities which suggest that the document is a forgery .
The idea behind this is that Obama was really born in Kenya ( in a lab , perhaps ? ) , and was later " smuggled " into Hawaii .
From FINAL REPORT ON OBAMA BIRTH CERTIFICATE FORGERY ,
It is irrefutable , empirical evidence - Obama 's birth certificate is a forgery .
Why ?
Why a COLB ( certificate of live birth ) forgery ?
That is the question .
Who Exactly is Obama ? from Right Side News , drives home the paranoia :
If elected , he would be the first Arab - American President , not the first black President .
Barack Hussein Obama is 50 % Caucasian from his mother 's side and 43.75 % Arabic and 6.25 % African Negro from his father 's side .
While Barack Hussein Obama 's father was from Kenya , his father 's family was mainly Arabs ..
Barack Hussein Obama 's father was only 12.5 % African Negro and 87.5 % Arab .
There are already thousands of references to this weird story on the web .
With all of that as background , here is what I think is an upcoming smear attack that will be echoed across the right 's communication channels .
In February , The Corner at National Review Online posted Obama 's Political Origins .
. . . all of my mixed race , black / white classmates throughout my youth , some of whom I am still in contact with , were the product of very culturally specific unions .
They were always the offspring of a white mother , ( in my circles , she was usually Jewish , but elsewhere not necessarily ) and usually a highly educated black father .
And how had these two come together at a time when it was neither natural nor easy for such relationships to flourish ?
Always through politics .
No , not the young Republicans .
Usually the Communist Youth League . . . .
I do n't know how Barak Obama 's parents met .
But the Kincaid article referenced above makes a very convincing case that Obama 's family , later , ( mid 1970s ) in Hawaii , had close relations with a known black Communist intellectual .
. . .
Political correctness was invented precisely to prevent the mainstream liberal media from persuing the questions which might arise about how Senator Obama 's mother , from Kansas , came to marry an African graduate student .
This story refers to this from Accuracy in Media , Obama 's Communist Mentor ,
In his biography of Barack Obama , David Mendell writes about Obama 's life as a " secret smoker " and how he " went to great lengths to conceal the habit . "
But what about Obama 's secret political life ?
It turns out that Obama 's childhood mentor , Frank Marshall Davis , was a communist . [. . .]
Obama 's communist connection adds to mounting public concern about a candidate who has come out of virtually nowhere , with a brief U.S. Senate legislative record , to become the Democratic Party frontrunner for the U.S. presidency .
. . .
AIM recently disclosed that Obama has well - documented socialist connections , which help explain why he sponsored a " Global Poverty Act " designed to send hundreds of billions of dollars of U.S. foreign aid to the rest of the world , in order to meet U.N. demands
I suspect this " he came out of nowhere " idea is going to be repeated over and over .
It has a " do n't trust him " insinuation that feels like it will stick in certain brains .
It lends credence to the really weird stuff that I see bubbling up in the right 's channels .
An example of what is coming can be found in this " PUMA Blog Network " blog " It 's The Communism Stupid " titled , Obama Socialist Trojan Horse and Hive Builder .
Hear the Buzzing ?
Is Obama a Marxist / Stalinist Trojan Horse ..... a Marxist Mole ?
How else is one to explain this candidate who came out of nowhere and since 1996 and involvement with the Chicago Democratic Socialists of America , he has been able to " leap " every three years up the power ladder ..... looking for the GOLD Ring of being the most powerful person in the United States ?
Going back to his roots we find : 1 . His father , from Kenya was a Socialist and wrote papers relating to the oppression of the people of Kenya .
... 3 .Obama 's grandfather introduced him to Frank Marshall Davis , an activist and poet with ties to the Communist Party .
. . .
5 . From Occidental College , Obama transferred to Columbia University and majored in political science and international relations .
OK , I admit my favorite is the way this post highlights political science and international relations as proof that something sinister is going on .
This is a long , paranoid post ( please try to skim it at least ) but I am seeing it echoed around the right 's networks so you have to take it seriously .
OK , to the the meat of the coming attack .
The outlines of it are here in this post , Who " sent " Obama ?.
I know this is weird stuff , but you can see how this paranoid theme develops if you skim it .
It is very difficult to follow the logic , but the claim appears to be that Obama is the product of a secret cabal connected to Stalinist - Maoist - Che Guevara - Hugo Chavez communists .
So take a look ( again , my apologies , it 's weird . )
So it is reasonable to ask , who " sent " Barack Obama ?
In other words , how can his meteoric rise to political prominence be explained ? [. . .]
The people linked to Senator Obama grew to political maturity in the extreme wings of the late 60s student and antiwar movements .
They adopted some of the worst forms of sectarian and authoritarian politics .
...
Many of them have joined up with other wings of the late 60s and 70s movements , in particular the pro-China maoists elements of that era and are now playing a role in the labor movement and elsewhere .
. . .
The most recent effort was by Jonathan Kaufman in the Wall Street Journal who argued that a critical connection for Obama was his links to some in the wealthy and prominent Jewish community in Chicago .
. . .
So , who did " send " Obama ? . . . more likely to the family of ( in ) famous former Weather Underground leader Bill Ayers - not just Bill Ayers , but also Bill 's father Tom Ayers and his brother John as well .
. . .
In my view these types of councils are reminiscent of the manipulative " community " bodies set up in regimes like those of Hugo Chavez and the Sandinistas - used to control genuine democratic movements such as trade unions .
. . .
Ayers , of course , had long held what the left once knew , broadly , as " maoist " politics - a view of the world that was opposed to Russian style bureaucratic communism from above , instead advocates of this approach supported sending revolutionary cadre to " swim among the masses like fish in the sea " or attempting to establish guerilla foco as romantically theorized by Regis Debray and carried out with disastrous results by Che Guevara . [. . .]
So , why or how did Obama - at that point not yet the prominent first black president of the Harvard Law Review ( that would happen the following year ) - end up at Sidley ?
Sidley had been long time outside counsel to Commonwealth Edison .
The senior Sidley partner who was Comm Ed's key outside counsel , Howard Trienens , was a member of the board of trustees of Northwestern alongside Tom Ayers ( and Sidley partner Newton Minow , too ) .
It turns out , Bernardine Dohrn worked at Sidley also .
She was hired there in the late 80s , because of the intervention of her father - in - law Tom Ayers , even though she was ( and is ) not a member of any state bar .
Dohrn ... her former Weather Underground ( now recast as the " Revolutionary Armed Task Force " ) " comrades , " including Kathy Boudin ( biological mother of Chesa Boudin , who was raised by Ayers and Dohrn ) participated .
. . .
The father of Chesa Boudin , David Gilbert , was sentenced to 75 - to - life , with no chance of parole , after a trial in which he refused to participate .
Chesa is the co-author of a recent apologia for the regime of Venezuelan " left " strong man , Hugo Chavez .
. . .
I can only speculate , but it is possible that Tom Ayers introduced Obama to Sidley .
That might have happened if Obama had met up with Bill and Tom and John Ayers prior to attending law school when Obama 's DCP group was supporting the reform act passed in 1988 .
Or it might have been Dohrn who introduced Obama to the law firm . [. . .]
In fact , in retrospect the Ayers / Ayers ( business from above , local activism from below ) joint campaign against both the Chicago School District bureaucracy and the Teachers Union is reminiscent of the kinds of alliances one finds in neo -stalinist regimes like that of Cuba , China or Sandinista - run Nicaragua .
In the Chinese Cultural Revolution , for example , Mao appealed to local activists to attack the party bureaucracy .
These authoritarian movements often try to build their power against democratic institutions like unions . [. . .]
As it turns out , there are other ex-SDS types around the Obama campaign as well , including Marilyn Katz , a public relations professional , who was head of security for the SDS during the disaster in the streets of Chicago in 1968 .
. . .
Davidson and Katz were key organizers of the 2002 anti-war demonstration where Obama made public his opposition to the Iraq war that has been so critical to his successful presidential campaign .
Davidson apparently moved into the maoist movements of the 70s after the disintegration of SDS .
...
Now that we have some idea of who " sent " Obama , the left and labor movement deserve to know more about how the exhausted ideas of the authoritarian side of 60's politics may still be influencing the thinking of a potential U.S. president .
Maybe Andy Stern 's endorsement of Obama makes more sense , now .
If you have time , follow the links .
They go on and on like that .
It seems the idea is if you throw in the words " Maoist " enough times people will get really scared .
I might be right .
I might be wrong .
But my instincts and experience tell me that this is a smear attack that is bubbling up .

Fliers cheer laptop policy change Starting today , some fliers wo n't have to remove laptops from bags at security .
WASHINGTON --
It 's not surprising that Tim Burke is taking an airplane flight Monday , but it is unusual that he 's looking forward to it .
The reason : Starting on Saturday , some of the nation 's airline passengers will not have to remove their laptops at airport checkpoints .
" I 'm going to feel a sense of freedom , " said Burke , CEO of Garven gift - packaging company , who makes weekly flights between his home in Denver and the company 's headquarters in Minneapolis .
Passengers who have what the Transportation Security Administration calls " checkpoint - friendly " laptop cases — so - called because X - ray machines can easily see through them — will be free to go through security without opening the case .
The policy change by the TSA could speed up security lines for the 2 million people who take U.S. flights each day and reduce incidents in which laptops are damaged , lost or forgotten in airports .
" Not having to deal with a computer is a big thing , " said Burke , who bought a $ 25 laptop sleeve he thinks he can put through checkpoint X - ray machines with his MacBook inside .
The new policy also could create confusion at the nation 's 450 commercial airports .
The TSA is not certifying or approving laptop cases , brands or styles .
Instead , the agency has published guidelines for the checkpoint - friendly cases , essentially requiring that they provide a clear and uncluttered view of the laptop through an X - ray machine .
If a TSA screener can't get a clear X - ray view of a laptop to verify that it's not concealing explosives , the screener can order it to be checked .
" There 's going to be an education issue with consumers .
Some people wo n't understand what checkpoint - friendly is , " said Jim Lahren , vice president for marketing at Briggs & Riley Travelware .
The company , like many others , tested its laptop cases in June at Washington Dulles International Airport with a TSA screener giving feedback .
Lahren said the company is adding embroidered " checkpoint - friendly " labels to cases , which will be in stores in two weeks .
He worries that other companies will add similar labels even if their cases do n't follow TSA standards .
The TSA is posting signs at checkpoints explaining the guidelines to passengers .
The for - sale listings on the online hub Craigslist come with plaintive notices , like the one from the teenager in Georgia who said her mother lost her job and pleaded , " Please buy anything you can to help out . "
Or the seller in Milwaukee who wrote in one post of needing to pay bills — and put a diamond engagement ring up for bids to do it .
Struggling with mounting debt and rising prices , faced with the toughest economic times since the early 1990s , Americans are selling prized possessions online and at flea markets at alarming rates .
To meet higher gas , food and prescription drug bills , they are selling off grandmother 's dishes and their own belongings .
Some of the household purging has been extremely painful — families forced to part with heirlooms .
" This is not about downsizing .
It 's about needing gas money , " said Nancy Baughman , founder of eBizAuctions , an online auction service she runs out of her garage in Raleigh , N.C .
One former affluent customer is now unemployed and had to unload Hermes leather jackets and Versace jeans and silk shirts .
At Craigslist , which has become a kind of online flea market for the world , the number of for - sale listings has soared 70 percent since last July .
In March , the number of listings more than doubled to almost 15 million from the year - ago period .
Craigslist CEO
Jeff Buckmaster acknowledged the increasing popularity of selling all sort of items on the Web , but said the rate of growth is " moving above the usual trend line . "
He said he was amazed at the desperate tone in some ads .
Economists say it is difficult to compare the selling trend with other tough times because the Internet , in wide use only since the mid-1990s , has made it much easier to unload goods than , say , at pawn shops .
But clearly , cash - strapped people are selling their belongings at bargain prices , with a flood of listings for secondhand cars , clothing and furniture hitting the market in recent months , particularly since January .
Earlier this decade , people tapped their inflated home equity and credit cards to fuel a buying binge .
Now , slumping home values and a credit crisis have sapped sources of cash .
Meanwhile , soaring gas and food prices have n't kept pace with meager wage growth .
Gas prices have already hit $ 4 per gallon in some places , and that could become more widespread this summer .
The weakening job market is another big worry .
Christine Hadley , a 53 - year - old registered nurse from Reading , Pa. , says she used to be " a clotheshorse , " splurging on pricey Dooney & Bourke handbags .
But her live - in boyfriend left last year , and she has had trouble finding a job .
Piles of unpaid bills forced her to sell more than 80 items , including the handbags , which went for more than $ 1,000 on a site called AuctionPal.com .
Now , except for some artwork and threadbare furniture , her house is looking sparse .
" I need the money for essentials — to pay my bills and to eat , " Hadley said .
At AuctionPal.com , which helps novices sell things online , for - sale listings rose 66 percent from February to March , much faster than the 25 percent to 30 percent average monthly pace since the company was formed in September , CEO Maureen Ellenberger said .
She said she was surprised to see that most of her clients desperately needed to sell items to raise cash .
For LiveDeal.com , a classifieds and business directory site , for - sale listings for January through March rose 10 percent from the previous year .
" We can definitely detect economic stress on the part of the consumer , " said John Raven , the site 's chief operating officer .
On Craigslist , Buckmaster said , three of the four fastest - growing for - sale categories are tied to gas — recreational vehicles like campers and trailers , cars and trucks , and boats .
Raven noted more and more listings for furniture , particularly in areas around Miami and Las Vegas and other regions hardest hit by the housing crisis .
Baughman , who runs eBizAuctions , said that over the past four months she 's been working mostly with sellers who are desperate .
Most are middle - class customers who can't pay their bills and now want to be paid up front for the items instead of waiting until they are sold , she said .
The trend may be hurting secondhand stores .
Donations to the Salvation Army were down 20 percent in the January - to - March period .
George Hood , the charity 's national community relations and development secretary , said that was probably partly because people were selling their belongings instead .

The Imaginary Case Against the Wind Turbine
August 18th , 2008 by Joshua S Hill
With the rush to install as many renewable energy generators by the end of the year in the US , there are more and more stories popping up about great steps being made .
However , sadly , with an increase in the good , there is also an increase in the bad , and it looks as though some people have a major bone to pick regarding the installation of wind turbines .
More often than not , in our efforts to bring environmental news to attention , we find ourselves as writers having to step back a bit , divorcing ourselves from the story to just portray the facts of the matter at hand .
This often leaves us with a lot of pent up aggression and anger , often focused towards those seemingly doing all that they can to hurt the environment .
Well no longer , I say , or at least , not for the next 10 minutes .
I have had enough of the petty machinations of men and women who are literally attempting to deceive people into an environmentally unfriendly way of life .
This latest tirade was sparked by an article written by the Associated Press .
It is a lengthy tale , focusing primarily on the Maple Ridge Wind Farm , the largest wind project in New York State .
In particular , one Mr. John Yancey , a man for whom I am immediately categorizing as a man who would oppose better education for America if it happened to interfere with his life in the slightest .
Apparently , and I ’ll try and be short , Mr. Yancey hates the turbines that his father allowed to be installed on the family land .
“ I was sold out by my own father , ” he apparently sputtered after indicating it was the noise , the “ rhythmic whoosh , whoosh , whoosh of wind turbines ” as author Helen O’Neill put it , that so enrages him .
“ I just want to be able to get a good night ’s sleep and to live in my home without these monstrosities hovering over me , ” he says .
It gets better , because apparently his father ’s decision to allow the installation of these wind turbines across the Yancey land , forced him to not speak to his father for a long time , in addition to – for whatever reason – taking a toll on his marriage .
Now if you have n’t already caught my disgust for this man , let ’s just focus on the fact that John Yancey must actually be the world ’s pettiest man , to apparently be so disturbed by the noise of these wind turbines .
While it may not be first hand , I spent just a few minutes on YouTube listening to the videos taken of wind turbines , and it seems to me that the noise is not even louder than occasional traffic .
Furthermore , and what outrages me the most , is the fact that I have lived on main roads for a vast majority of my life .
In fact , my bedroom currently resides with an open window less than 5 meters from a main road .
Not only do I not care , but I am no longer affected by the noise .
This also comes after living my entire early life in quiet suburbs , with no noise at all .
It ’s simple ; you adapt !
The noise is n’t the only problem that some people will attempt to raise .
Michelle Bennett yesterday wrote about the possible health risks thrown up by wind turbines , a topic that anyone in an unbiased position will acknowledge to be up in the air at best .
There are the accusations that they are destroying bird populations as well , and are an ecological menace .
After spending the past hour looking at examples of people who have issues with wind turbines , I begin to get a feel for what it must have been like a century or so ago , when the automobile and skyscrapers begun to appear .
Some petty English Lord probably exercised some close relationship with a city official to ensure that cars were not allowed to drive within a mile of his front gates .
Basically , it all comes down to this ; wind turbines = cleaner energy , which in and of itself should also reduce land owners electricity bills ( in addition to the handsome rent deals they are signing ) .
These complaints ( with the exception of the possible health risks which I will get 100 % behind if proven to be true ) are nothing but modern day versions of complaints that have been pestering the majority for centuries , from petty minded individuals with more interest in their own little lives than anyone else .

Iran has some of the highest execution rates in the world
At least eight women and one man are reported to have been sentenced to death by stoning in Iran .
The group , convicted of adultery and sex offences , could be executed at any time , lawyers defending them say .
The lawyers have called on the head of Iran 's judiciary to prevent the sentences from being carried out .
The last officially reported stoning in Iran last year drew strong criticism from human rights groups and the European Union .
The eight women sentenced , whose ages range from 27 to 43 , had convictions including prostitution , incest and adultery , Reuters news agency reported .
The man , a 50 - year - old music teacher , was convicted of illegal sex with a student , reports said .
Moratorium imposed Under Iran 's Islamic law , stoning to death is the punishment for the crime of adultery .
In 2002 Iranian judiciary chief Ayatollah Mahmoud Hashemi Shahroudi imposed a moratorium on stoning , but at least three people are reported to have been executed by stoning since then .
Shadi Sadr from the Volunteer Lawyers ' Network , which is representing the women , said : " We are very worried as there are at least eight women and one man with a definitive verdict which can be carried out any moment .
Our specific ... demand is to have the stoning sentence stopped by Ayatollah Shahroudi since the defendants are liable to be stoned at any moment
Lawyer Mariam Kian - Arsi
" There are no guarantees that the punishments will be halted or commuted . "
She called on the international community to back their efforts , adding : " We are in close touch with human rights organisations and many of them have supported our campaign . "
Fellow defence lawyer Mariam Kian - Arsi said : " Our specific and clear demand is to have the stoning sentence stopped by Ayatollah Shahroudi since the defendants are liable to be stoned at any moment . "
Women ' poorly represented '
In theory the penalty of stoning to death applies to both men and women .
But the lawyers say that in practice , many more women than men receive the sentence because they are less well educated and often poorly represented in court .
Human rights group Amnesty International earlier this year called on Iran to abolish " this grotesque punishment " and said many facing execution by stoning were sentenced after unfair trials .
Under Iran 's strict penal code , men convicted of adultery should be buried up to their waists and women up to their chests for stoning .
The stones used should not be large enough to kill the person immediately .

What are these ?
Qantas today confirmed a panel had fallen off a jumbo jet mid-flight , but federal Transport Minister Anthony Albanese has urged Australians not to " talk down " the national carrier .
The Boeing 747 was en route to Singapore from Melbourne when the small engine access panel became detached , a Qantas spokesman said .
The problem was discovered during routine checks on the plane after it arrived at Singapore 's Changi Airport early this morning .
The auto industry has experienced what could best be described as a " demand meltdown " in the US for trucks and SUVs .
Countless land yachts are sitting brand new and unwanted on dealer lots while used ones are becoming worthless as trade - ins .
So , Toyota has decided to combat this problem the best way they can : by sending its US - made oversized vehicles overseas .
Sound expensive ?
Sure , but better than sending them to the junkyard .

“ It ’s far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price . ”
If you can grasp this simple advice from Warren Buffett , you should do well as an investor .
Sure , there are other investment strategies out there , but Buffett ’s approach is both easy to follow and demonstrably successful over a period of more than 50 years .
Why try anything else ?
For anyone who is not an accountant , annual reports of companies are dull things indeed .
Once you know how much money a company has made ( and you do n’t need the annual report for that ) , there is n’t anything much that ’s worth reading .
However , there is one company in the world whose annual report is eagerly awaited for the interesting reading material that it has and that ’s the American company Berkshire Hathaway .
The reason ?
The annual letter to shareholders that is written by the great investor ( and Berkshire Hathaway ’s Chairman and CEO ) , Warren Buffett .
Buffett is perhaps one of the most respected businessmen of the world .
His ideas on business and investing are full of a simple wisdom that would have sounded naive and unworldly had it not been for Buffett ’s fantastic track record .
Buffett ’s 2007 letter , which was released on February 29 , is as interesting to read as any of the earlier ones .
The central tenet of Buffett ’s investment philosophy is that one should not invest in anything that one does not understand and that one should be unremittingly focused on long - term value .
Buffett is also deeply skeptical of financial engineering and ‘ innovative ’ financial instruments .
In today ’s situation , when volatility rules and people are investing day - to - day and sometimes hour - to - hour , it ’s worthwhile to take a cool look at what people like Warren Buffett have achieved and how they ’ve achieved it .
Read
Last week , I read a newspaper article whose writer asked some well - known names in the investment management business their opinion of Buffett and came away with a lot of the criticism .
The underlying theme in most of these views seemed to be that Buffett ’s approach is somehow unrealistic and not suited to ‘ flexible ’ approach required by working fund managers .
This theme is there in a lot of the criticism that Buffett faces .
I find this line of criticism bizarre because it sort of seems to suggest that Warren Buffett is some sort of a guy who lives in a cave somewhere and keeps preaching impractical stuff that does n’t work in the real world .
Excuse me , but Buffett sits at the top of the real world .
As of now he ’s the richest man in that real world .
He is the only investor who is amongst the richest people in the world .
He is exactly as flexible - no more , no less - than was needed to generate returns of 5,000 ( 500,000 per cent ) times for his shareholders over 40 years , beating the stock markets by a wide margin .
I think the basic reason for so many financial industry types around the world to be anti-Buffett is nothing but jealousy .
Not only has he done better than them , but he has done so while frequently expressing utter contempt for their ways .
He has gone so far as to call the sub prime - induced crisis ‘ poetic justice ’ for Wall Street .
Last years ’ letter argued that complex financial instruments are time bombs and “ financial weapons of mass destruction ” that could harm not only their buyers and sellers , but the whole economic system .
Buffett has been justifiably able to say ‘ I told you so , ’ for so long that it ’s no surprise that a lot of people are irritated by his success .
In a crowd of investors and businessmen who seem to be competing to be more and more like each other , here ’s a man who speaks in a unique voice - and more importantly , listens to it , and lives by it .
If investing in wonderful companies at fair prices is good enough for Warren Buffett — arguably the finest investor on the planet — it should good enough for the rest of us .
Polar bear : ' At risk '
Eco-tourists may be endangering the wildlife they are trying to save , scientists have warned .
Animals from polar bears to penguins are being put at risk by the boom in holidays , in which people pay a premium for environmentally - responsible breaks which may include conservation work .
The latest research found a fivefold drop in numbers of coyotes and bobcats in a protected Californian forest frequented by nature - lovers .
Researcher Adina Merenlender told New Scientist : ' We see it over the whole park , not just a single trail . '
Previous studies have shown that dolphins become stressed by boatloads of tourists , while well - wishers may be causing polar bears ' heart rates to rise .
Penguin chicks admired by tourists tend to be lighter than others - possibly because their parents wait until the coast is clear before feeding them .

What really happened in Georgia ?

Some basic facts :
1 . The citizens of South Ossetia have long expressed a desire to break away from Georgia and , in fact , declared themselves independent from Georgia in the 1990s .
2 . On the first day of the 2008 Olympics , Georgia launched an all - out , " shock and awe " attack on numerous civilian targets in Tskhinvali , the capital city of South Ossetia
3. Russia , which shares a border and a long historical connection with South Ossetia , sent troops into the region to fight back the attacking Georgian military .
4 . The arms for Georgia 's attack on South Ossetia were largely provided by the US .
5 . The US and UK news media have successfully managed to portray these events as a random , unprovoked and savage attack on Georgia by Russia .
In this video , Mikhail Gorbachev responds .
This detailed analysis of the US 's provocations in Georgia was published one month ago :
Georgia , Washington and Moscow : a Nuclear Geopolitical Poker Game
Over the course of history , humanity has suffered some horrifying damage to our collective cultural legacy in the form of books and other text lost to accident or neglect .
The digitalization of text holds out the promise of permanently preserving the written word in an archive that can be distributed widely and kept safe from accidental damage .
This presents archivists with a challenge : the works that are most in need of preservation are likely to already be damaged or distorted , making the use of automated scanning and text processing less likely to succeed .
Researchers are now reporting on a successful way to identify the words that computers can't handle : turn them into CAPTCHAs , and get people to do the work .
For those who have n't heard the term , CAPTCHA stands for Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart .
In practical terms , a CAPTCHA takes the form of a string of characters subjected to distortions that make it difficult for computerized character recognition to identify them .
Humans , who have a visual recognition capacity that vastly outperforms even the best computers , generally do pretty well in identifying these distorted characters .
That has made the CAPTCHA a useful tool ( although the bad guys are catching up ) for keeping spam bots from harvesting e-mail addresses or posting spam - filled messages to public forums .
Researchers at Carnegie Mellon noticed a while back that there are parallels between CAPTCHAs and the problem words in scanned works : in both cases , the letters were distorted to the point where computers were n't capable of recognizing the underlying word .
So , they created a system , reCAPTCHA , in which words that were n't recognized by character recognition software were distorted slightly and converted into CAPTCHAs .
We covered the announcement of the system over a year ago .
Today 's issue of Science contains a paper describing the result which , by all measures , appears to be a resounding success .
According to the authors , humans handle over 100 million CAPTCHAs every day .
" This mental effort is precious , " they write , " since deciphering CAPTCHAs requires people to perform a task that computers cannot . "
Their automated system attempts to harvest this precious effort .
Scanned text is subjected to analysis by two optical character recognition programs ; in cases where the programs disagree , the questionable word is converted into a CAPTCHA .
It , along with a control word of known identity ( used for cases where a bot is trying to crack the CAPTCHA ) are then distributed to participating websites .
Currently , over 40,000 sites are using reCAPTCHA .
The identification performed by each computer program is given a value of 0.5 points , and each interpretation by a human is given a full point .
Once a given identification hits 2.5 votes , the word is considered called .
Those words that are consistently given a single identity by human judges are recycled as control words .
Image is Creative Commons licensed
The researchers tested the system using a random sampling of 250 New York Times articles from different eras where the identity of every word was confirmed by two independent transcription experts .
Each OCR software program managed about 84 percent accuracy but , when their results were combined with the reCAPTCHA system , the overall accuracy shot up to 99.1 percent .
That 's actually within the bounds of professional transcription services that use two independent experts to generate copies that are then examined by a third party .
The few remaining problems typically came when the OCR software missed word breaks .
The authors also tested software designed to crack CAPTCHAs against images created using reCAPTCHA , and found that they failed completely .
The authors ascribe this to the fact that the letters in scanned images contain distortions that are not the result of a clean mathematical transformation .
User response times were also measured , but there were no significant differences between the time it took users to handle traditional systems and that required to use reCAPTCHA .
There are still a few limits to the system ; short words are n't recognized as accurately , results from countries where English is a second language and the use of non-English keyboards is common tend to be spotty , and users are very casual about capitalization , punctuation , and spelling .
Still , any improvements based on these identified limits will be going up from 99.1 percent accuracy ; the gains are likely to be marginal .
The best news for those running sites that use the reCAPTCHA system is that their users seem to like it , since it makes the process something more than a mindless security measure .
It 's great to see what the authors term " wasted human processing power " put to use in a way that makes the processors feel good about contributing .

( CNN ) --
For nearly two years , the South Florida middle school art teacher forced the boy to have sex in a classroom supply closet .
Aaron Mohanlal , here in his sex offender registration photo , was allowed to stay out of prison on bond .
Sometimes , Aaron Mohanlal would call in sick to work , take the boy to his home for sex and drop the seventh - grader back off at school at the end of the day .
To keep the abuse secret , Mohanlal bought the 13 - year - old a cell phone and created nicknames for their genitalia .
When police arrested him , the teacher was caught on hidden video trying to destroy letters threatening the boy if he ever told .
Last summer , a Broward County jury convicted Mohanlal of 13 counts , including child abuse , molestation and lewd battery , and a judge sentenced him to 43 years .
But a year later , Mohanlal has yet to spend a day in prison .
" I can't understand why he is n't behind bars , " said the victim , now 18 .
The network is not disclosing his name because it does n't identify sexual assault victims .
" I want to move on with my life .
I 'm trying to graduate high school and forget about this , " he said .
" I try not to think about it , but it 's hard , because all I can think about is , what if he 's out there around other kids ? "
Weeks after the trial , Broward Circuit Judge Marc Gold , who presided over the trial and sentenced Mohanlal , granted the teacher a rare bond that allows him to remain free while his case is tried on appeal , a process that could take years .
During the two months CNN has investigated this story , Mohanlal has been working a construction job in Broward County and spending time at a house in Sunrise , Florida , 15 miles from where the boy and his family live , according to the Broward County Sheriff 's Office .
He resigned from his teaching job in 2005 after his arrest .
" The idea of that monster being that close to my family again is outrageous , " said the boy 's father , who is often so overwhelmed with rage and sadness that he drives to a park , leans against a tree and sobs .
" What did we go through a trial for ? " he said .
A man who identified himself as Mohanlal hung up on a CNN reporter who called his home in Port St. Lucie , Florida , his address on record with the state 's sex offender registry .
Mohanlal 's appellate attorney , Tom Odom , refused to comment on the case beyond saying , " Everyone has a right to a first appeal . "
Gold gave Mohanlal the right to live , work , travel and attend church in South Florida , according to numerous interviews and documents CNN has obtained .
The judge ordered Mohanlal to wear a GPS device , register as a sex offender and surrender his passport .
He stipulated that Mohanlal cannot contact the boy and his family but did not order him to stay away from children , according to a transcript of the July 2007 bond hearing .
Read the entire bond hearing
Mohanlal was allowed to post the $ 610,000 bond using his relatives ' properties as collateral , the transcript shows .
Post - conviction bonds are rarely given in criminal trials , but judges occasionally grant them if there was a procedural error during trial that would make a conviction reversal at the appellate level likely , legal experts say .
But there were no procedural mistakes during Mohanlal 's trial , both prosecutor Anita White and defense attorney Steve Rossi said .
Under Florida statute , defendants without prior felonies are eligible for post - conviction bond unless they have committed first - degree murder or sexual battery .
Mohanlal was n't convicted of first - degree sexual battery .
He was convicted of second - and third - degree felonies , and he had no prior felony record .
Gold refused to talk on record about why he granted the bond .
He would only give this statement : " The simple truth is that I had to rule based on what was presented to me during that hearing .
And I took everything into consideration and felt a bond was appropriate . "
" For a judge to delay jail is highly unusual , but it 's especially unusual when you have someone convicted of a serious crime like sexual molestation of a child , " said CNN legal analyst and criminal attorney B.J. Bernstein .
" One of the concerns is that you have someone who commits a sex offense who , by their employment , seeks to be around children .
They have abused that trust between a student and teacher . "
A dozen legal experts , including criminal attorneys based in Florida , said they agree with Bernstein .
None could recall a single case of a violent offender receiving the same kind of treatment .
Information on how many offenders are out on post - conviction bonds in Florida is difficult to find .
There is no entity in the state , including the Florida Department of Corrections , that keeps track .
Last year , the boy 's family won $ 300,000 from the school district after a civil claim that the district failed to protect the student .
Other students in Mohanlal 's class testified that their teacher handed them fliers , with the boy 's picture and phone number , that falsely accused the teen of having sex with animals .
Caught on surveillance camera at a grocery store copying the fliers , prosecutors say Mohanlal had become a disturbed lover scorned when the boy entered high school and began rejecting his advances .
And there was evidence that Mohanlal was grooming other children .
One middle - schooler told police that Mohanlal rubbed his arms and back during class ; another testified at trial that his teacher gave him his cell phone number , money and hair conditioner .
" This was one of the most disturbing cases I 've ever worked on , and there 's no doubt in my mind that Aaron Mohanlal is a dangerous person , " said Miramar Police Sgt. Jeff Armiento .
The investigator learned that Mohanlal was released on bond when he randomly searched for him on the state 's correctional Web site .
" I was astonished , flabbergasted , " Armiento said .
" I called the state attorney 's office to see if it was some kind of mistake .
I do n't see what would stop him from doing this to other kids . "
Mohanlal 's GPS device is monitored 24 hours a day by the Broward County Sheriff 's Office , meaning his location appears on a computer screen .
Otherwise , there is no police agency watching him .
Kristina Gulick , who oversees the electronic monitoring system , said Mohanlal gives the agency weekly itineraries to help police follow his whereabouts .
But 70 days of itineraries from March to June that CNN obtained from the Broward Sheriff 's Office are not detailed ; for example , some say Mohanlal intends to leave his home at 6:30 a.m. and return at 9:30 p.m. but do not say where he will be or what his plans are .
" We are confident that he is doing what he 's supposed to be doing , " Gulick said .
" We have had no reason to think otherwise . "
Because Mohanlal was required to register as a sex offender , he must provide the Florida Department of Law Enforcement with his home address .
That home is in Port St. Lucie , about two hours from Broward County .
See Mohanlal 's sex offender registration
The St. Lucie County Sheriff 's Department is required to make four visits to the home each year and verify that Mohanlal is living there based on what he tells deputies , according to department spokesman Mark Weinberg .
" This guy has all the reason in the world to take off , " said Tom Blomberg , dean of the College of Criminology and Criminal Justice at Florida State University .
Blomberg conducted a 2006 study of sex offenders who are monitored by wearable GPS devices .
" He 's looking at prison for the rest of his life , " Blomberg said , " and child molesters are almost always victimized in prison .
He has to know that .
" This is not effective monitoring .
In fact , it 's a little bit beyond imagination what 's going on here , " Blomberg said .
" The [ GPS ] technology works ; that 's not the problem .
Police can only do so much .
The question is whether this guy should be out of prison .
" This seems like a system failure on down . "

All About Sexual Offenses • Child Abuse • Broward County
Weight loss surgery works , but is so invasive and has such unpleasant long - term side effects that it ’s recommended for only a fraction of the obese population , and even many in that group are reluctant to undergo the surgery .
In hunting for a simpler and safer alternative , researchers have zeroed in on a nerve that carries much of the communication between brain and gut .
Disrupting this communication , they believe , could lead to safe , effective and sustained weight loss -- mainly by cutting off signals from the gut that tell the brain it ’s time to eat .
The concept still has to be validated , says Dr. Philip Schauer , immediate past president of the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery , a Gainesville , Fla . - based association of U.S. weight loss surgeons , “ But if it gives even a modest amount of weight loss , it could be a winner . ”
Two different methods of disrupting the vagus nerve are now in clinical trials .
One method , vagotomy , simply cuts the nerve and permanently disables it .
The other , vagal nerve blocking , uses an electric current to periodically confuse the nerve and prevent it from transmitting signals .
Preliminary results suggest that both methods help to safely reduce excess body weight by about 20 % on average within six months of therapy .
Amid the complex set of muscles , nerves and organs that team up to regulate body weight , one anatomical feature stands out : the vagus nerve .
Running from the brain through the esophagus and branching out to reach nearly every part of the digestive system , this nerve plays a key role in weight gain .

When the stomach is empty , the vagus nerve informs the brain and triggers the feeling of hunger .
When the stomach contains food , the vagus tells the brain and relays back the brain ’s commands to secrete stomach acid to help digest the food .
The brain ’s control of the passage of food through the digestive system also relies on the vagus nerve .
In short , without the vagus , we would get less hungry , and food would stay longer in the stomach .
The vagus nerve does even more than that .
While food is being digested , the brain tells the pancreas to make insulin , a hormone that helps store energy from food in fat tissues .
That command passes through the vagus nerve .
So too does another that instructs fat tissues to grow by absorbing more nutrients .
“ Everything this nerve does is designed to make you take up energy and put it into your fat , ” says Dr. Robert Lustig , a pediatric endocrinologist at UC San Francisco and one of the lead investigators in a 30 - patient clinical trial of vagotomy for weight loss .
“ It ’s your energy storage nerve . ”
First noticed in the 1940s
The vagus nerve ’s pivotal role in weight gain would appear to make it a prime target of obesity therapy .
But this potential was discovered almost by accident in the 1940s , when surgeons treating intractable ulcers tried vagotomy to help reduce stomach acidity .
The method worked , and soon became widely used ( drug therapy eventually superseded it ) .
But the operation had an unexpected side effect :
It made obese patients lose weight .

Early vagotomy surgeries cut the entire vagus nerve as well as some stomach muscles .
This drastic method caused undigested food to be dumped into the intestines , leading to a range of unpleasant side effects , such as diarrhea , vomiting , flushing and dizziness .
The modern form of the procedure is much more refined :
It cuts only the parts of the vagus that control hunger and weight gain , leaving the stomach muscles and the rest of the nerve intact .
As a result , the side effects of vagotomy are now much milder and tend to disappear after a few months , Lustig says .
Launched in 2005 , the trial Lustig is involved in is taking place at UC San Francisco and the University of Rochester .
About 80 % of the 30 subjects in the trial lost an average of about 30 % of their excess body weight in the first six months , Lustig says .
The trial is sponsored by EndoVx , a Napa - based company that is developing a device to simplify the vagotomy procedure .
One of Lustig ’s patients , 57 - year - old Garth Michaels of Walnut Creek , says he lost about 40 pounds within months of surgery .
He got rid of 60 pounds more over the next year after starting a regular exercise program , and is down to a manageable 220 pounds .

“ It ’s harder for extra weight to come on to me , and it ’s easier for it to fall off than it used to be , ” he says .
In fact , he adds , he feels that his whole attitude toward food has changed for the better after his vagotomy .
“ I eat less food , eat it more slowly and enjoy it more . ”
Once the vagus nerve is cut , it ca n’t be restored -- a potential drawback , because the reduced appetite and slowed digestion may no longer be required or even desirable once a patient attains a healthy body weight .
And so some researchers are testing whether it ’s possible to achieve the weight loss effects of vagotomy while keeping the vagus nerve intact .
The technique they are using is called vagal nerve blocking , which has been developed by St. Paul , Minn . - based EnteroMedics .
A surgeon implants a matchbox - sized device in the patient ’s side that sends a high - frequency electrical signal to the vagus nerve .
The electrical signal effectively blocks the nerve , causing the same effect on appetite and digestion as a vagotomy , says Mark Knudson , the company ’s chief executive .
Turning off the signal restores vagus function , he adds .
This procedure is now being evaluated in a 300 - patient placebo - controlled study underway at several U.S. research centers .
Patients in both arms of the EnteroMedics - sponsored trial are implanted with the device .
But it is not turned on in the placebo group .

“ Vagal nerve blocking gets to the root of the problem to inhibit the hunger pains these patients have , ” says Dr. Ninh Nguyen , a gastrointestinal surgeon who is leading the trial at the UC Irvine Medical Center .
One of Nguyen ’s subjects , San Juan Capistrano resident Jeff Collins , 25 , says he has lost about 20 pounds since he joined the trial in December at more than 300 pounds .
Wearing the VBLOC device causes only mild discomfort , he says .
And judging by the result , he thinks he is getting the therapy , not the placebo .
“ I still love food , and still get hungry , ” he says .
“ But I am eating healthier , and eating a lot less than I used to . ”
Each has its downside
Advertisement
Both vagotomy and vagal nerve blocking have advantages and drawbacks .
“ With vagotomy , they snip something , and your anatomy is permanently altered , ” Knudson says .
“ With our method , you are living a more normal life . ”
“ With the EnteroMedics approach , you carry a foreign object in your body that needs constant attention and could cause infection , ” Lustig says .
“ Vagotomy does n’t have those problems . ”
Both treatments are done using a technique called laparoscopic surgery , which is much less invasive than most weight loss surgeries .
Knudson estimates that VBLOC therapy will cost about as much as gastric bypass surgery ( about $ 25,000 , according to the National Institutes of Health ) .
Vagotomy as it is done now would cost about $ 9,000 , Lustig estimates .
But costs could come down if an experimental technique for snipping the vagus nerve using sound waves , developed by EndoVx , turns vagotomy into a simple outpatient procedure .
This has been tested on animals and will be tried on human patients next year , says William Aldrich , the company ’s chief executive .
It is n’t yet known whether either procedure will have a lasting effect on body weight .
The body ’s ability to adapt to a weight loss therapy and find other ways to gain weight has doomed many initially promising anti-obesity drugs .
VBLOC tries to prevent the body from adapting to it by using intermittent , rather than constant , blocking of the nerve , Knudson says .
Since vagotomy can’t do this , obesity researchers such as Dr. Samuel Klein of the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis predict it may produce only temporary weight loss .

Lustig , however , cites earlier studies that found that weight loss from vagotomy was sustained for up to 25 years and says that most of his patients have not regained lost weight after 18 months .
Both approaches are being conducted only in clinical trials for now .
If the VBLOC study goes well , the device is likely to get Food and Drug Administration approval within two to three years , Knudson says .
Vagotomy , since it is a surgical procedure , does not need FDA approval , but the EndoVx device for snipping the vagus nerve would need to be approved , and this could take several years , Lustig says .
For now , the only really effective therapy for severe obesity is weight loss surgery , Schauer says .
“ But perhaps in five or 10 years we may have a minimally invasive procedure that is just as effective . ”

A more sympathetic strategy ?
Advertisement
Disabling the vagus nerve slows down energy storage in fat tissue .
Another surgery may make the body burn fat faster .
Such a procedure would target the sympathetic nervous system , which regulates fat burning -- as opposed to the parasympathetic nervous system ( including the vagus nerve ) , which regulates energy storage .
Some researchers believe that stimulating certain sympathetic nerves could promote weight loss by burning off more calories from fat tissue .
“ It is like getting the effect of exercise without having to do real exercise , ” says Dr. Jiande Chen , a gastroenterologist at the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston .
Clinical evidence for this idea is lacking , Chen cautions , but indirect support comes from studies on dogs , cats , rabbits and other animals .
For instance , in a 1998 study on hamsters at Georgia State University in Atlanta , Timothy Bartness and co-workers found that cutting the sympathetic nerves to part of an animal ’s fat tissues prevented its body from burning up the energy stored there .
Unlike the remaining fat tissues , the “ denervated ” tissue did not shrink even when food intake was decreased .
This suggests that stimulating the nerves instead could have the opposite effect -- of promoting fat burning .
Inspired by this possibility , Brooklyn Center , Minn . - based Leptos Biomedical is building a pacemaker - like electronic device designed to stimulate sympathetic nerves in specific fat tissues in the body .
In addition to shrinking these tissues , the therapy may cause patients to feel fuller and less hungry , says Kobi Iki , vice president of research at the company .
Animal studies show that the method produces consistent weight loss , reduced food intake and an increase in the muscle - to - fat ratio , Iki says , and the company is currently preparing for human trials of the method .

Although much more speculative as a therapy for obesity than vagotomy or vagal nerve blocking , sympathetic nerve stimulation has a potential advantage over them .
By allowing the surgeon to choose which sympathetic nerves to stimulate , it offers the possibility of targeted weight loss .
Thus the technique could be used to get rid of “ bad ” fat around organs while sparing fat elsewhere in the body , according to Dr. Ken Fujioka , an endocrinologist and principal investigator of the VBLOC trial at Scripps Clinic in La Jolla , and a consultant for Leptos .
“ If you can target abdominal fat , that is really the Holy Grail right now . ”

Ten Essential Emacs tips
Phil Sung
13 Jun 2008 ( revised 13 Oct 2009 )
These are some of the Emacs features I use the most on a day to day basis ( plus a few tricks ) .
For more like this , also see Guided Tour of Emacs .
1. Documentation at your fingertips .
It is difficult to learn more ( and difficult to want to learn more , even ) about Emacs until you know how to get to documentation easily .
There are a few tiers of useful commands here , the most useful of which are : C-h C-h ( help about help ; essential ! ) , C-h k , C-h f and C-h v ( show the purpose of a key , function or variable , respectively ; indispensable ) , C-h r ( read the Emacs manual , within Emacs ) .
In no other program I 've used has the completeness of documentation approached that of Emacs .
And using the documentation commands to find what you need is both faster and more direct than using Google .
More information about help .
2. Keyboard macros .
I have already used keyboard macros in the course of writing this article , and I 'm only on # 2 .
In most editors , macros are only useful for the simplest and most mundane of tasks because you can hardly do anything useful using the keyboard alone .
Emacs is different because it has such a large toolbox of high - level commands ( for starters , commands for moving around in and manipulating characters , words , lines , sentences , functions , paragraphs , pages , and entire files ) .
In Emacs , if you know how to perform some task on the keyboard , then it takes just a couple of extra keystrokes to repeat it as many times as you like — no programming needed !
To record a macro , press F3 , do whatever it is you want to be recorded , and press F4 .
Then press F4 F4 F4 ... to replay as many times as you like .
( In contrast , when you need to learn a completely new scripting language to automate some task — say , Visual Basic , for Office — and then figure out how to do your original task in that language , that can be a huge demotivator . )
Emacs macros have two killer features : ( 1 ) Once you 've defined a macro you can say , " please repeat this macro until it would cause Emacs to start beeping " .
If your macro does some sort of transformation on a single line and moves to the next line , then M - 0 F4 causes Emacs to do that transformation on all lines until it has reached the last line .
Awesome .
( 2 ) Counters let you insert a different number every time a macro is run .
Useful for , among other things , making consecutively ( or non-consecutively ! ) numbered lists .
More information about macros .
3. Rectangle editing .
Even though XML is supposed to be the new hot thing , people still do a lot with columnar data .
It 's pretty much everywhere in a typical Unix , for starters .
The Emacs rectangle commands let you manipulate , copy and move rectangles of text ; you specify the rectangles by putting mark at one corner and point at the opposite corner .
You can also " insert " rectangles by adding the same text in the same position on a bunch of consecutive lines .
More information about rectangles .
4 . The mark ring .
You should never have to scroll around randomly in a buffer to find " that place you were just looking at " .
Whenever you take a diversion ( e.g. by searching , or pressing M-< or M -> ) , Emacs uses the mark to save your previous position , kind of like sticking your finger behind one page of a book while you go to glance at another page .
You can return to the mark with C-x C-x .
However , Emacs saves up to 16 previous values of the mark , and you can jump to previous ones with C-u C - SPC .
This makes mark and the mark ring a valuable navigation tool .
You can use it somewhat mindlessly : if you ever find yourself asking " where was I just now ? " you can often just press C-u C - SPC until you find yourself back in the right place .
( You can also set the mark explicitly yourself with C - SPC , but I almost never need to do that for navigation purposes , only for marking regions . )
More information about the mark ring .
5. Ediff .
Ediff is an easy way to compare two versions of a file .
The most common way I activate it is with M-x ediff - buffers .
Emacs highlights the differing regions in the buffers and pops up a new window in which you can enter additional commands .
For example , n and p move among differing regions in the buffers .
For each region , you can copy the first ( or second ) buffer 's version to the other buffer with a and b , respectively .
You can even edit either buffer while Ediff is active .
Then you can switch back to the Ediff window and press ! to recompute the diff .
Being able to view the differences between two files interactively — while editing those files — can be really useful .
More information about ediff .
6. Tramp .
Ever start up another shell so you could run Emacs to edit a file ?
( e.g. a root shell , or a shell on a remote host )
Well , Tramp has greatly reduced the number of situations where this is necessary .
It allows you to edit " remote " files as if they were local to your machine , taking care of opening up shells , retrieving and writing data for you , etc .
You simply specify remote files using a special syntax in C-x C-f ( and near anywhere else Emacs asks you for a filename ) , e.g. : /ssh:phil@remotehost:records/pizza-toppings.txt .
I say " ' remote ' " in quotes above because Tramp is general enough that you can also use it to edit local files — as another user — via su or sudo e.g. : /sudo::/etc/hosts .
More information about Tramp .
7. Compilation - mode and friends .
One common theme in Emacs is that it gives you a lot of the raw power of tools you already know how to use — your compiler , grep , etc. — and then it augments them with super - powers .
For example , when you run make using M-x compile , Emacs displays the compiler output in a new window .
Should any compile errors appear , Emacs highlights them and notes their line numbers .
Pressing C-x ` ( M-x next - error ) will jump directly to the line in your source code which caused the first error ; press C-x ` repeatedly to jump to successive errors .
( You can also click on the entries in the compilation output buffer . )
You can go forwards and backwards through the list of errors using M -g n and M - g p ( next - error and previous - error respectively ) .
This facility is general enough that you can use the same keys to jump to line numbers that appear in the output of M-x grep or M-x occur .
In short , there is really no reason for you to have to explicitly note filenames and line numbers in program output , because Emacs can jump directly to them for you .
More information about " compilation mode " .
8. VC .
I use Git for all my personal projects , and occasionally CVS and SVN for projects that I interact with .
Emacs provides a package called VC which lets me perform many version control operations from within Emacs .
It provides a layer of uniformity : the commands are all the same regardless of what version control system I am using for any particular project .
This is great because it means that when bzr or hg or whatever comes into vogue , I can get quite a bit of work done before I have to learn yet another VCS .
Typical workflow for me : open a file .
Make and test some changes .
C-x v = to show a diff .
If I like it , C -x v v to prepare a commit .
Emacs pops up a new window in which to type a commit message .
C-c C-c there to make the commit .
VC includes many other useful features , like showing annotated versions of files , showing change logs for particular files , and helping you review historical versions and diffs .
More information about VC .
9 . Emacs server and multi-TTY support .
Multi-TTY support , available in Emacs 23 + , makes opening new Emacs frames painless and fast .
You might use this when you open a file from the shell , or when you run an external program that invokes $ EDITOR .
( However , so much functionality is available directly from within Emacs that it makes many external programs superfluous . )
To use multi-TTY , run M-x server - start in a running instance of Emacs .
The set your $ EDITOR to emacsclient -t .
When a program invokes the editor , emacsclient contacts your existing instance of Emacs which opens up a new frame on the TTY you were using .
It looks as if you had just run emacs , except that you can access all the state of your other instance : all your buffers , kill ring entries , etc. are there .
And it starts up pretty much instantly .
When you are done , press C-x # to finish and close that frame .
I use emacsclient to invoke Emacs in all sorts of other places .
For example , instead of reading man pages using man , I read them in Emacs .
Here 's a snippet of my . bashrc :
pps_man ( ) { /usr / bin/emacsclient -t -e " ( woman \ " $ 1 \ " ) " } alias man=pps_man
10 . global - set - key .
Everyone has a different set of commonly used commands .
Whatever features of Emacs you use the most , bind them to keys to save yourself time .
For example , to bind C -c s to shell globally :
( global - set - key " \C- cs " ' shell )
Users may bind C -c [ any letter ] for their own use , and all major and minor modes are supposed to respect that .
More information about key bindings and key binding conventions .
Who is Bud Day ?
Well , we know this about Bud Day :
Day , who lives in Pensacola , was part of the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth that smeared former Democratic nominee John Kerry 's war record in 2004 .
McCain , who spearheaded major campaign finance reforms , has criticized so - called 527 groups that are not regulated by election laws and can raise unlimited money for attack ads .
But Day said : " The bottom line is this : 527 groups can do very effective , truthful things , and the Swift Boat attack was totally truthful . ''
But , surely only McCain speaks for McCain , right ?
Wrong .
This was a conference call organized by the McCain campaign .
Bud Day is mentioned 143 times on John McCain 's website .
This Swiftboat slimeball was trotted out by the McCain campaign as recently as June 30 to smear Wes Clark .
John McCain feels that it 's appropriate to have bigoted Swiftliars who want to declare war on over a billion people speaking for him .
That speaks volumes about John McCain .
UPDATE II : The McCain campaign just endorsed Bud Day 's comments .
John McCain wants to declare war on the entire Muslim faith .
He is a dangerous radical and war - monger .
He 's worse than Bush .

Barack Obama was in Kaukauna , Wisconsin today talking about tax cuts .
Surprisingly Obama used much of his speech to talk about John McCain ’s tax cut plan which he described as a tax code that rewards wealth instead of work .
“ We both favor tax cuts .
The difference is that Senator McCain wants to continue a Bush tax code that rewards wealth ; I want to reform our tax code so that it rewards work .
That ’s why the typical middle - class family will get three times more from my tax cut than the one John McCain has proposed , while nearly a quarter of his tax cuts go to households making over $ 2.8 million every year .
That ’s right – $ 2.8 million .
That ’s where John McCain wants to focus his tax relief in this struggling economy , ” Obama said .
He also accused McCain of flip - flopping on the Bush tax cuts , “ And Senator McCain once knew better .
He said that he could n’t vote for the Bush tax cuts in good conscience because they were too skewed to the wealthiest Americans , but now he wants to make those same tax cuts permanent .
Later , he said it was irresponsible to cut taxes during a time of war because we could n’t afford them , but now he ’d continue running up hundreds of billions of dollars in debt while spending billions of dollars a day in Iraq .
There ’s nothing conservative about that . ”

Obama said that McCain ’s plan is twice as regressive as Bush ’s , and he has no plan to pay for it , “ Because the fact is , Senator McCain is now calling for a new round of tax giveaways that are twice as expensive as the original Bush plan and nearly twice as regressive , and he has no concrete plan to pay for it . ”
“ He ’d spend nearly $ 2 trillion over a decade in tax breaks for corporations , including $ 1.2 billion for Exxon Mobil .
Think about that .
While you ’re paying four dollars at the pump and your children ’s future is being mortgaged under a mountain of debt , Senator McCain wants to give billions of dollars in tax breaks to Big Oil , and opposes a windfall profits tax on oil companies like Exxon to help families struggling with high energy costs , ” he continued .
Obama proposed a $ 500 tax cut for all workers , and a $ 1000 tax cut for families .
He also wants to eliminate income taxes for those on Social Security who earn less than $ 50,000 , and simplify the tax code .
The proposals by both candidates are pretty much the standard partisan fare .
What is interesting is that so far Obama has been targeting his economic message to swing states North Carolina , Florida , and now Wisconsin .
Obama is extending the definition of change to include economic change .
This is smart move .
Its success or failure will go a long way towards determining the fate of his campaign in November .

“ WATER is the oil of the 21st century , ” declares Andrew Liveris , the chief executive of Dow , a chemical company .
Like oil , water is a critical lubricant of the global economy .
And as with oil , supplies of water — at least , the clean , easily accessible sort — are coming under enormous strain because of the growing global population and an emerging middle - class in Asia that hankers for the water - intensive life enjoyed by people in the West .
Oil prices have fallen from their recent peaks , but concerns about the availability of freshwater show no sign of abating .
Goldman Sachs , an investment bank , estimates that global water consumption is doubling every 20 years , which it calls an “ unsustainable ” rate of growth .
Water , unlike oil , has no substitute .
Climate change is altering the patterns of freshwater availability in complex ways that can lead to more frequent and severe droughts .
Untrammelled industrialisation , particularly in poor countries , is contaminating rivers and aquifers .
America 's generous subsidies for biofuel have increased the harvest of water - intensive crops that are now used for energy as well as food .
And heavy subsidies for water in most parts of the world mean it is often grossly underpriced — and hence squandered .
All of this poses a problem , first and foremost , for human welfare .
At the annual World Water Week conference in Stockholm this week , delegates focused on measures to extend access to clean water and sanitation to the world 's poor .
But it also poses a problem for industry .
“ For businesses , water is not discretionary , ” says Dominic Waughray of the World Economic Forum , a think - tank .
“ Without it , industry and the global economy falter . ”
Water is an essential ingredient in many of the products that line supermarket shelves .
JPMorgan , a bank , reckons that five big food and beverage giants —
Nestlé , Unilever , Coca - Cola , Anheuser - Busch and Danone — consume almost 575 billion litres of water a year , enough to satisfy the daily water needs of every person on the planet .
Although agriculture uses most water ( see chart ) , many other products and services also depend on it .
It takes around 13 cubic metres of freshwater to produce a single 200 mm semiconductor wafer , for example .
Chipmaking is thought to account for 25 % of water consumption in Silicon Valley .
Energy production is also water - intensive : each year around 40 % of the freshwater withdrawn from lakes and aquifers in America is used to cool power plants .
And separating just one litre of oil from tar sands — a costly alternative fuel made viable by high oil prices — requires up to five litres of water .
Quality matters as much as quantity .
According to the World Bank , around 90 % of the rivers in China near urban areas are seriously polluted .
The overall cost of water scarcity — from pollution and the depletion of groundwater — is estimated to be 147 billion yuan ( $ 21.4 billion ) a year , or almost 1 % of China 's annual output .
In 2007 poor water - quality cost China some $ 12 billion in lost industrial output alone .
Elsewhere , Taipei City in Taiwan no longer allows companies to tap its groundwater , because of shortages .
Firms in drought - ridden Australia have lived under stringent water restrictions for years .
Southern Company , an electricity utility based in Atlanta , temporarily shut down some of its power plants last summer because of a drought .
Indeed , according to a survey by the Marsh Centre for Risk Insights , 40 % of Fortune 1000 companies said the impact of a water shortage on their business would be “ severe ” or “ catastrophic ” — but only 17 % said they were prepared for such a crisis .
Not all companies are sitting still .
Since 1995
Dow has reduced the amount of water it uses per tonne of output by over a third .
Nestlé cut its water consumption by 29 % between 1997 and 2006 , even as it almost doubled the volume of food it produced .
And at Coca - Cola bottling plants from Bogotá to Beijing , schools of fish swim in water tanks filled with treated wastewater , testament to the firm 's commitment to clean all its wastewater by 2010 ( it is 84 % of the way there ) .
Cynics say such programmes are mere public relations .
There is some truth to this .
Companies that use freshwater in areas where it is scarce are understandably unpopular .
Activists have attacked both Coca - Cola and Pepsi , for instance , for allegedly depleting groundwater in India to make bottled drinks .
Coca - Cola took the matter to court and was exonerated by an independent commission , which blamed a regional drought for water shortages , but activists were not mollified .
Coca -Cola has responded by redoubling its attention to water — for instance , by backing a scheme in Kaladera to teach villagers how to harvest rainwater and irrigate crops more efficiently .
“ Regulatory licences to water are not enough , ” says Jeff Seabright of Coca - Cola .
“ We need a social licence — the OK from the community — to operate . ”
Cutting water consumption can also make business sense .
Using less water reduces spending on water acquisition and treatment , and on the clean - up of wastewater .
Some firms have no choice .
Elion Chemical in China is working with General Electric to recycle 90 % of its wastewater to comply with Beijing 's strict new “ zero - liquid discharge ” rules , which bar companies from dumping wastewater into the environment .
Of Nestlé 's 481 factories worldwide , 49 are in extremely water - stressed regions where water conservation and re-use is the only option .
Such farsightedness is , alas , only a drop in the bucket .
In a drought , even water - efficient factories can run into trouble .
Moreover , the water used within a factory 's walls is often only a tiny fraction of a firm 's true dependence on water .
José Lopez , the chief operating officer of Nestlé , notes that it takes four litres of water to make one litre of product in Nestle 's factories , but 3,000 litres of water to grow the agricultural produce that goes into it .
These 3,000 litres may be outside his control , but they are very much a part of his business .
2:30 PM UPDATE : The video is now working ….again …finally .
UPDATE :
The video was uploaded a few minutes ago , so if you ’re getting an error trying to view it , give it a few minutes and come back .
Today , in what has to be one of the more desperate , unfounded and outrageous claims coming from McCain , he just said on national television that “ it seems to me that Senator Obama would rather lose a war in order to win a political campaign . ”
Watch the video — and watch McCain ’s creepy smirk at the end .
He knows what he said is brutal — a brutal lie :
[ youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09ob6vjS8aY]
Pure desperation .
In fact , the McCain camp said the same thing a week ago , with nary a word from the corporate media .
Republicans always do something , then accuse Democrats of doing the same thing .
In 2002 , George Bush , Dick Cheney and Karl Rove started playing politics with national security and led the United States into the Iraq war .
John McCain played right along .
NOTE FROM JOHN : John McCain just questioned Barack Obama ’s patriotism .
He did it probably on the advice of Karl Rove , who has been advising him for months .
Rove ’s usual tactic is to say something like this in order to get a rise out of the left , and help us make the story .
That ’s part of what this is about – getting the theme out there that Obama is un-American ( aka “ muslim ” ) .
But also , McCain is simply desperate to change the topic from Obama ’s wildly successful trip to the Middle East .
When are Mrs. Greenspan , Bob Schieffer , and the rest of the corporate media going to hold John McCain to the same standard they hold Barack Obama ?
John McCain basically just accused Barack Obama of treason .
Had we done that to McCain , just imagine the fireworks .
Will the media report how outrageous and desperate McCain has become , or will they do their usual he - said - she - said and present McCain ’s “ argument ” as something worthy of honest debate ?
One last thing .
I can imagine some Democrats saying “ oh no , do n’t respond or you ’ll make it a story just like Karl Rove wants you to . ”
Well , yeah , we could follow that advice .
Or we could ask ourselves “ what would Karl Rove do ? ” Karl Rove would do what McCain did to Wesley Clark .
He would so quickly , so publicly eviscerate us that we would never again have the nerve to question his good patriotic heart .
That ’s what Karl Rove would do .
Democrats , however , sit back , shut up , and take it , hoping it ’ll go away .
Yeah , how ’s that working for us , now that we ’re in our third decade of being called un-American and weak on defense ?
ORLANDO  Presumptive Republican presidential nominee John McCain told USA TODAY on Sunday that he has no problem with his top foreign policy adviser Randy Scheunemann 's past lobbying work .
The fighting between Russia and Georgia has brought renewed attention to Scheunemann and the lobbying firm he founded , Orion Strategies , which received more than $ 730,000 from Georgia since 2001 , records show .
PRICE OF POWER : Read the full USA TODAY series
Scheunemann 's role as lobbyist and campaign adviser came to light in May , when USA TODAY reported he had contacted McCain 's Senate office on Georgia 's behalf last year while he was working for the campaign .
Scheunemann in March ended his lobbying work for Orion , which continues to represent Georgia , and formally separated from the firm in May , said McCain spokesman Brian Rogers .
" I'm proud to have supported them , " McCain said of Georgia in an interview on the campaign plane .
" And I 'm so proud that so many of my friends have done so , who also believe in freedom and democracy . "
McCain said he found it interesting that Barack Obama 's campaign called him " confrontational " with Russia .
Yet " rather than worry about the people of Georgia , " McCain said , his Democratic rival " worried about whether someone on my staff had supported Georgia or not . "
Democratic groups have criticized Scheunemann 's past lobbying work as a conflict of interest .
At Orion Strategies , Scheunemann 's foreign clients have included Romania , Latvia , Macedonia and Taiwan .
" The fact that John McCain is proud of the lobbyists running his campaign and does n't understand the conflict of interest his lobbyist - advisers represent shows that he simply cannot be trusted to bring change to Washington , " Damien LaVera , a spokesman for the Democratic National Committee , said Sunday .
Campaigning in Nevada , Obama also criticized McCain 's advisers as " the same old folks that brought you George W. Bush .
The same team . "
Scheunemann has been a prominent foreign policy conservative for years .
He was an adviser to former senator Bob Dole , both in the Senate and during Dole 's 1996 presidential campaign .
Scheunemann also advised then - Senate majority leader Trent Lott before leaving to join a lobbying firm , the Mercury Group , in 1998 .
McCain 's 2000 presidential campaign brought in Scheunemann as a foreign policy adviser .
After the 2000 election , Scheunemann returned to lobbying and also joined the board of directors of the Project for the New American Century , a conservative foreign policy think tank .
Scheunemann and others at the think tank wrote to President Bush nine days after the 9/11 attacks , urging " a determined effort to remove Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq . "
Scheunemann founded a group called the Committee for the Liberation of Iraq during the run-up to the March 2003 invasion .
Scheunemann 's partner , Michael Mitchell , signed a $ 200,000 contract for Orion Strategies to represent Georgia on April 17 , the firm 's Justice Department filings show .
That same day , McCain issued a statement saying he had spoken by phone with Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili " about Russian moves to undermine Georgian sovereignty . "
McCain , an advocate for Georgia democracy for more than a decade , has advocated Georgia 's " territorial integrity " since the invasion .
Georgia 's internationally recognized borders include the breakaway provinces of South Ossetia and Abkhazia , now occupied by Russia .
On Sunday , McCain said there are a number of steps the international community can take short of military force to produce " pressures that will change the Russians ' behavior . "
They include rejecting Russia 's entry into the World Trade Organization , canceling Russia - NATO military exercises , and possibly speeding up the admission of Georgia and Ukraine into NATO .

Why waste money and add to the world ’s usable waste by buying art materials when there are so many strange and interesting objects out there to use for design projects instead ?
From small found objects to entire abandoned houses , the sky is the limit when it comes to the palettes of these amazing trash artists .
Their subject matter is about as varied as their material choices , ranging from self - portraiture and crushed can paintings to imitations of Monet ’s masterpieces and gigantic sculpture parks .
Tom Deininger is no doubt one of the most creative and versatile trash artists in the world .
His collages viewed from a distance seem like they could be made of anything – and they are indeed made out of just about everything he can find .
He “ majored in women , art and surfing ” at college and “ learned little about all three ” by his own humorous admission .
About a decade ago he moved to Rhode Island and started toying with found objects as artistic materials .
In addition to creating his junk art Tom also lectures at local schools and colleges and creates canvas paintings .
Nek Chand Saini‘s undeniable opus is his 1.7 million square - foot Rock Garden in Chandigarh – much of which he built on his own secretly and in his spare time .
For years while working as a building inspector Chand reused found materials to begin constructing a remote complex of courtyards and sculptures out of pottery , concrete and other recycled materials .
Since these constructions took place on a conserved plot of state - owned land they were nearly destroyed once discovered .
The public came to his support , however , and rather than having his constructions torn down he was given workers and a salary to do his work with the official blessings of the city .
His works have since traveled the world .
Tyree Guyton began the Heidelberg Project decades ago with the help of family , friends and neighborhood kids .
As they cleaned up the streets of their area they began reusing the refuse they collected to fill the area with art .
Deserted houses became massive sculptures and canvases , trees turned into places to hang strange found objects and dead lawns were developed into sculpture pedestals .
Despite the destruction of many of these works by the city the project persists in the community .
This project has breathed life and color into a city in need of both .
Elizabeth Lundberg gathers objects of a kind and recycles them into artwork that is sometimes serious , sometimes silly ( such as a basket made of baseballs … get it ?
A ballbasket ! ) .
By changing the use of objects she encourages us to question their meaning and our relationship to them .
Trained at the Haystack Mountain School of Crafts in mixed media and North Carolina State University in environmental design , Elizabeth has had her trash art featured in shows around the country .
Charles Kaufman makes one kind of art … but he makes it well .
His crushed can works involve flattened beer and soda cans which he paints by hand and then mounts individually .
Of course , both the painting itself ( being hand - done ) and the can ’s particular shape ( being hand - crushed ) is entirely unique .
Aside from his crushed can works he also paints with a similarly engaging color palette and likewise cartoonish flare .
Chris Jordan ‘s Running the Numbers series is not so much art made from trash as art representing the amazing impact of garbage and astounding scale of waste on our planet .
The collection of portraits each takes on a single subject from office paper to aluminum cans and shows the quantities visually used by different industries or in varying specific circumstances ( e.g. the number of plastic cups used on airlines every year ) .
He makes these abstractly large numbers comprehensible by rendering them visual .
Of his work , Chris says that by “ employing themes such as the near versus the far , and the one versus the many , I hope to raise some questions about the role of the individual in a society that is increasingly enormous , incomprehensible , and overwhelming . ”
Gugger Petter has been obsessively creating works of two - and three - dimensional art from ordinary newspaper for decades .
She applies lacquers to preserve these otherwise fragile works of art and selections different sections to achieve the colors , blacks and whites for specific areas of each work .
She also sometimes paints the newspapers but often leaves them as they are .
Her subjects are generally as typical and everyday as her materials – simple portraits of daily life .
1 Eskimo Nebula
The Eskimo Nebula ( NGC 2392 ) , also known as the Clownface Nebula , was discovered by astronomer William Herschel in 1787 .
From the ground , it resembles a person ’s head surrounded by a parka hood .
In 2000 , the Hubble Space Telescope produced this image of it .
From space , the nebula displays gas clouds so complex that they are not fully understood .
The Eskimo Nebula is clearly a planetary nebula .
It is surrounded by gas that composed the outer layers of a Sun - like star only 10,000 years ago .
The visible inner filaments are ejected by strong wind of particles from the central star .
The outer disk contains unusual light - year long orange filaments .
NGC 2392 lies about 5000 light - years away and is visible with a small telescope in the constellation of Gemini .
2 Pillars of Creation
This Hubble image , showing star forming pillars in the Eagle Nebula , is one of the most popular poster images of outer space , and often appears in science - fiction movies .
The Eagle Nebula was one of the space regions passed through during the opening “ zoom out ” shot of the movie Contact ( 1997 ) , and appeared in the opening scene of the Babylon 5 episode Into The Fire .
The Eagle Nebula , along with the Hourglass Nebula , was featured in the liner notes of Pearl Jam ’s 2000 album Binaural .
3 Pale Blue Dot
“ Pale Blue Dot ” is the name of THIS famous Voyager 1 photograph of Earth , and the title of a book by Carl Sagan inspired by the photo .
On February 14 , 1990 , NASA commanded the Voyager 1 spacecraft , having completed its primary mission , to turn around to photograph the planets it had visited .
NASA ultimately compiled 60 images from this unique event into a mosaic of the Solar System .
One image Voyager returned was of Earth , 4 billion miles distant , showing up as a “ pale blue dot ” in the grainy photo .
Britt describes the distance as “ more than 4 billion miles ” .
The picture was taken using a narrow - angle camera at 32 º above the ecliptic , and created using blue , green , and violet filters .
Narrow - angle cameras , as opposed to wide - angle cameras , are equipped to photograph specific details in an area of interest .
In addition , only 0.12 pixels represents Earth in the photo .
Sagan said the famous Earthrise picture taking during the Apollo 8 mission , showing the entire Earth above the moon , forced humans to step back and see the Earth as just a part of the universe .
In the spirit of that realization , Sagan said he pushed for Voyager to take a photo of the Earth from its vantage point on the edge of the solar system .
There was danger to the spacecraft ’s optics from the nearby Sun.
Voyager took similar pictures of Venus , Jupiter , Saturn , Uranus and Neptune .
Thus the Pale Blue Dot photo was part of a “ portait ” of the Solar System that was created by Voyager 1 .
4 Supernova 1987A
SN 1987A was a supernova in the outskirts of the Tarantula Nebula in the Large Magellanic Cloud , a nearby dwarf galaxy .
It occurred approximately 51.4 kiloparsecs from Earth , close enough that it was visible to the naked eye .
It was the closest supernova since SN 1604 , which occurred in the Milky Way itself .
The light from the supernova reached Earth on February 23 , 1987 .
As the first supernova discovered in 1987 , it was labeled “ 1987A ” .
Its brightness peaked in May with an apparent magnitude of about 3 and slowly declined in the following months .
It was the first opportunity for modern astronomers to see a supernova up close .
Since 51.4 kiloparsecs is approximately 168,000 light - years , the cosmic event itself happened approximately 168,000 years ago .
To put this in perspective , Homo sapiens sapiens ( modern humans ) evolved about 200,000 years ago .
5 Antennae Galaxies
Hubble produced this image in October 1997 .
The Antennae Galaxies ( also known as NGC 4038 / NGC 4039 ) are a pair of galaxies about 68 million ly away in the constellation Corvus .
They were both discovered by Friedrich Wilhelm Herschel in 1785 .
The chaotic swirls of blues and oranges represent a firestorm of new star birth ignited by the head - on collision of interstellar hydrogen .
The long arcing insect - like “ antennae ” represent matter flung from the scene of the accident .
6 Hubble Deep Field
The Hubble Deep Field ( HDF ) is an image of a small region in the constellation Ursa Major , based on the results of a series of observations by the Hubble Space Telescope .
It covers an area 144 arcseconds across , equivalent in angular size to a tennis ball at a distance of 100 metres .
The image was assembled from 342 separate exposures taken with the Space Telescope ’s Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 over ten consecutive days between December 18 and December 28 , 1995 .
The field is so small that only a few foreground stars in the Milky Way lie within it ; thus , almost all of the 3,000 objects in the image are galaxies , some of which are among the youngest and most distant known .
By revealing such large numbers of very young galaxies , the HDF has become a landmark image in the study of the early universe , and it has been the source of almost 400 scientific papers since it was created .
7 Crab Nebula
The Crab Nebula ( catalogue designations M1 , NGC 1952 , Taurus A ) is a supernova remnant in the constellation of Taurus .
The nebula was first observed in 1731 by John Bevis .
It is the remnant of a supernova that was recorded by Chinese and Arab astronomers in 1054 .
Located at a distance of about 6,300 light years ( 2 kpc ) from Earth , the nebula has a diameter of 11 ly ( 3.4 pc ) and is expanding at a rate of about 1,500 kilometres per second .
The nebula contains a pulsar in its centre which rotates thirty times per second , emitting pulses of radiation from gamma rays to radio waves .
The nebula was the first astronomical object identified with a historical supernova explosion .
8 Cat ’s Eye Nebula
The Cat ’s Eye Nebula ( NGC 6543 ) is a planetary nebula in the constellation of Draco .
Structurally , it is one of the most complex nebulae known , with high - resolution Hubble Space Telescope observations revealing remarkable structures such as knots , jets and sinewy arc - like features .
It was discovered by William Herschel on February 15 , 1786 , and was the first planetary nebula whose spectrum was investigated , by the English amateur astronomer William Huggins in 1864 .
Modern studies reveal several mysteries .
The intricacy of the structure may be caused in part by material ejected from a binary central star , but as yet , there is no direct evidence that the central star has a companion .
Also , measurements of chemical abundances reveal a large discrepancy between measurements done by two different methods , the cause of which is uncertain .
9 Gamma Ray Explosion
The Hubble Space Telescope captured this image of a gamma ray explosion [ shown at two different scales ] on January 23 , 1999 .
At the time it was the most powerful explosion ever recorded .
According to NASA , gammaray bursts “ may represent the most powerful explosions in the universe since the Big Bang , the explosive birth of our universe .
Hubble images showed that these brief flashes of radiation come from far - flung galaxies that are forming stars at enormously high rates .
By pinpointing the host galaxies , Hubble also identified the sources of the ‘ bursts ’ : the collapse of massive stars . ”
10 Protoplanetary Disks
A Hubble Space Telescope image shows “ proplyds , ” or protoplanetary disks , in the Orion Nebula .
According to NASA , nebulae , flattened disks of gas and dust , “ are the likely birthplaces of new planetary systems .
Hubble provided visual proof that pancake - shaped dust disks around young stars are common , suggesting that the building blocks for planet formation are in place . ”
Review : Mo ’s Bacon Bar ( by Vosges Chocolate )
Look at that picture above .
See the little bits in the bar of chocolate ?
That ’s bacon , baby .
Applewood smoked bacon .
The good folks at Vosges Chocolate had the sense to combine two great flavors – pork and chocolate – to create this salty bar .
Yes , the front of the box lists “ smoked salt ” as an ingredient , too , which I did n’t know existed .
And the tastes go together surprisingly well .
When you bite into it , first you get the deep milk chocolate ( 41 % cacao ) , then you get the salt , and finally the hint of bacon .
It ’s not overpowering , but you definitely have a meat flavor in the corners of your mouth .
It ’s kind of like eating a handful of buttered popcorn and caramel - chocolate popcorn at the same time ; almost like a cracker jack .
And everybody likes cracker jacks .
I recommend this All - American dessert for your next patriotic celebration .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Bank regulators closed a small Florida - based bank on Friday , the eighth U.S. bank to fail this year under pressure from a weak economy and a credit crisis precipitated by falling home prices .
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp said First Priority Bank had $ 259 million in assets and $ 227 million in deposits and its failure will cost the federal fund that insures deposits an estimated $ 72 million .
SunTrust Banks Inc STI.N has agreed to assume the insured deposits of First Priority , whose six branches will reopen Monday as branches of SunTrust Bank .
Customers can access their money over the weekend by check , teller machine or debit card , the FDIC said .
It is the first bank to fail in Florida since Guaranty National Bank of Tallahassee failed in March 2004 , according to the FDIC , which blamed the failure on exposure to the real estate market , predominantly in the construction lending area .
Florida is among several states whose housing markets have seen the sharpest declines .
The biggest bank failure by far this year is IndyMac IDMC.
PK , seized on July 11 with $ 32 billion in assets and $ 19 billion in deposits as of March , and the third - largest bank insolvency in U.S. history .
The FDIC oversees an industry - funded reserve used to insure up to $ 100,000 per account and $ 250,000 per individual retirement account at insured banks .
The agency also has running tally of problem banks that its examiners closely monitor .
At the end of first quarter , 90 institutions were on that list .
The FDIC does not name the institutions on the list , which is expected to be updated this month for the second quarter .
The first armoured personnel carrier nudged past the top of the hill .
It paused as if getting its bearings , and then set off towards Tbilisi .
Behind it , an endless column of Russian military vehicles appeared on a shimmering horizon - trucks , tankers , and a beaten - up Nissan .
The Russian army was on the move .
What was n't clear was where it was going .
For the next hour the column continued its sedate progress , past yellow fields and a hazy mountain valley , from Gori towards the Georgian capital , Tbilisi .
Thirty miles from the city , it stopped .
A Russian soldier hopped out of his vehicle and began directing traffic .
" We 've been told to stay there , " he explained , pointing down a rough dirt track towards the rustic hamlet of Orjosari , just over a mile away .
The soldier said Russia did n't intend to keep going down the main highway connecting Tbilisi to Gori , and the east and west of the country .
" The only reason we 've come here is because of a provokazia by Mikheil Saakashvili , " he said , accusing Georgia 's president of wrongdoing .
In theory the conflict between Russia and Georgia is now over , as European negotiators led by France 's president , Nicolas Sarkozy , hammer out a peace deal .
In reality , Russia 's mighty war machine was trundling insouciantly through Georgia .
Several Russian trucks overshot and missed their turning .
One broke down .
A soldier got the wheezing vehicle going again .
Where was he from ?
" Chechnya .
We 've come here to help , " he said .
For the terrified residents of Gori and surrounding villages , it did n't seem like help .
Yesterday morning , as the Russian tanks advanced from their base in South Ossetia they passed through Georgian controlled - villages , telling residents to hang out white flags or be shot .
Behind them , according to people fleeing those villages , came a militia army of Chechen and Ossetian volunteers who had joined up with the regular Russian army .
The volunteers embarked on an orgy of looting , burning , murdering and rape , witnesses claimed , adding that the irregulars had carried off young girls and men .
" They killed my neighbour 's 15 - year - old son .
Everyone was fleeing in panic , " Larisa Lazarashvili , 45 , said .
" The Russian tanks arrived at our village at 11.20 am .
We ran away .
We left everything - our cattle , our house , and our possessions . "
Achiko Khitarishvili , 39 , from Berbuki , added : " They were killing , burning and stealing .
My village is n't in a conflict zone .
It 's pure Georgia . "
These claims of Russian atrocities were impossible to verify .
But the mood of panic was real enough - with villagers fleeing towards Tbilisi by all means possible .
One family of eight piled into a tiny white Lada ; others fled on tractors .
For much of the day the Russian troops in Gori were busying destroying Georgia 's military infrastructure .
Smoke poured from the military supply camp in the village of Uplistsikhe .
Those who fled expressed a feeling of betrayal .
They said Russia 's president , Dmitry Medvedev , had duped them .
" I believed him when he said there was peace .
That 's why we stayed in our homes .
But it is n't true , " Lamzika Tushmali , 62 , said .
She added : " There is no ceasefire . "
At the end of the Russian column , a group of volunteers arrived in a shabby mini-van flying a Russian flag .
One of them had his face covered with a balaclava ; all were heavily armed ; their mood was exuberant .
What were they doing ?
" We 've come for a holiday , " one said .
For most of the day there was no sign of the Georgian army .
After five days of ferocious bombardment by Russian warplanes , it appears not to exist .
With rumours swirling of an imminent Russian attack on Tbilisi , however , Georgia mustered a platoon of 50 soldiers , who took up positions 10 miles down the road from where the Russians appeared to have parked up for the night .
On Georgian radio , meanwhile , military experts were discussing the possibility of a new partisan war against the Russians - suggesting that the government 's failure meant that it was time for ordinary Georgians to take the initiative .
It 's an idea that may take root .
" I spent two years in the Soviet army .
If there is a partisan army I 'll be in the first row , " Koba Chkhirodze , 41 , said yesterday .
LS9's Designer Biofuel , Renewable Petroleum
June 11th , 2008 by Courtney Carlisle Bolton
The privately held , venture backed industrial biotechnology company , LS9 , maintains that the answer to our gas crisis is renewable petroleum technology that they have custom engineered , a Designer Biofuel .
Researchers at the San Francisco - based company have been able to alter existing bacteria to yield new , diesel - producing strains .
They are also working on developing a bacteria strain that makes crude oil that canbe trucked and go through the refining process .
The hydrocarbon based biofuel mimics fuel properties of gasoline , diesel and jet fuel , which allows it to run through existing pipeline infrastructure and run in any vehicle , setting it apart from other biofuel products .
While LS9 ’s Designer Biofuel emits the same amount of greenhouse gas as regular crude oil and petroleum products in a combustible engine , the company purports that ultimately that they will have a much smaller impact since they do n’t have to drill for the feedstock .
Their product also produces twice the energy of regular petroleum products ; so , it requires half of the amount of feedstock to yield the same amount of energy .
Aside from the environmental questions of emissions , the company is also competing with the challenge of moving this laboratory production to full scale industrial production .

Sightings of mountain ringlet have been called for
The UK's only mountain dwelling species of butterfly could be wiped out in Scotland because of climate change , experts have warned .
Warmer temperatures are driving the mountain ringlet higher up hillsides in the search for cooler conditions .
Butterfly Conservation Scotland ( BCS ) has appealed to the public to report sightings as part of a Scottish Natural Heritage - funded project .
People are also asked to look for northern dart and netted mountain moth .
Paul Kirkland , BCS director , said ringlet faced a very real threat .
It is essential that we find out exactly what is hiding in the hills
Paul Kirkland
Butterfly Conservation Scotland
He said : " This butterfly is retreating higher up the hillsides as the warmer weather makes lower habitats unsuitable .
" The fear is that as climate change continues , this rare species will run out of mountain , and become extinct in Scotland . "
The flip side of global warming has seen species which have died out in the south surviving in Scotland .
They include chequered skipper butterfly , Kentish glory and New Forest Burnet moth .
Mr Kirkland said : " There are already parts of Scotland harbouring butterflies that have become extinct in England , and the largely unspoilt landscape found in the uplands is an increasingly important habitat .
" It is essential that we find out exactly what is hiding in the hills . "
There are 33 species of butterfly that regularly breed in Scotland and about 1,300 species of moths .

Just one more on the magic .
I just got this email from Mind Hacks readers Stefano suggesting that stage magicians that use psychological language actually pollute the public ’s understanding of science .
He also gives a much better , and , I ’m guessing , more accurate explanation of the hand - raising trick in Keith Barry ’s TED performance .
As a psychologist , I have to say I dislike the new sort of mentalism that we ’re seeing nowadays .
Derren Brown ( an incredibly talented performer , as you said ) tries to portray his show as something more than old - fashioned magic by introducing psychological terms and studies , somewhat erratically .
I understand that his use of scientific terminology might be part of the misdirection , but it really makes me cringe to see he perform ridiculous feats and justify it by citing things like the Milgram study , concentration abilities or persuasion techniques .
Almost every time he mentions a psychological concept , he either misrepresents it or uses it to explain absurd stuff that he did with stooges or simply old magic tricks .
I did n’t know Keith Barry , but I have to say his TED lecture made me put him on the same category as Derren Brown : old mentalist tricks disguised as “ persuasion and psychological techniques ” .
He even managed to fool you , it seems : the trick that you attributed to hypnosis has nothing to do with it , being achieved simply by the performer applying pressure on the feet of the subject instead of his hand .
Notice how he never says where the pressure will be , and his left leg is covered by the table .
His other live tricks are equally simple , and have nothing do with psychology , except for the fact that everything you do to an audience – even cheating / fooling them – is part of it .
Stefano makes an interesting point that these acts rely , in part , on misinforming people about psychology .
Derren Brown is a classic example where he often gives explanations after the trick so the viewer feels they are being let in on the secret , but which are obviously misleading and so are part of the more general misdirection that the feats are achieved through the ‘ power of the mind ’ .
In terms of the hand raising trick that Stefano mentions , looking back at the video , this seems a much more likely explanation .
In which case , this is a ‘ theory of mind ‘ illusion , where we are fooled into attributing a different mental state to the person picked from the audience than they actually have .
I hope you do n’t mind me publishing part of your email Stefano , I did try and email and ask but unfortunately the address was n’t valid .
Do get in touch if you have a website or blog and I ’ll happily link to it and many thanks for your interesting commentary .
“ We will hit those points in a few years , and that will help in many ways , ” Mr. Fleming said , referring to the loans made later in the housing boom .
“ We just have to survive through this part of the cycle . ”
Data on securities backed by subprime mortgages show that 8.41 percent of loans from 2005 were delinquent by 90 days or more or in foreclosure in June , up from 8.35 percent in May , according to CreditSights , a research firm with offices in New York and London .
By contrast , 16.6 percent of 2007 loans were troubled in June , up from 15.8 percent .
Some of that reflects basic math .
Over the years , some loans will be paid off as homeowners sell or refinance , and some homes will be foreclosed upon and sold .
That reduces the number of loans from those earlier years that could default .
Also , since the credit market seized up last year , lenders have become much more conservative and have stopped making most subprime loans and cut back on many other popular mortgages .
The resetting of rates on adjustable mortgages , which was a big fear of many analysts in 2006 and 2007 , has become less problematic because the short - term interest rates to which many of those loans are tied have fallen significantly as the Federal Reserve has lowered rates .
The recent federal tax rebates and efforts to modify more loans have also helped somewhat , analysts say .
What will sting borrowers more than rising interest rates , analysts say , is having to pay interest and principal every month after spending several years paying only interest or sometimes even less than that .
Such loan terms were popular during the boom with alt - A and prime borrowers and appeared appealing while home prices were rising and interest rates were low .
But now , some borrowers could see their payments jump 50 percent or more , and they may not be able to sell their properties for as much as they owe .
Prime and alt - A borrowers typically had a five - or seven - year grace period before payments toward principal were required .
By contrast , subprime loans had a two - to - three - year introductory period .
That difference partly explains the lag in delinquencies between the two types of loans , said David Watts , an analyst with CreditSights .
“ EVERYBODY wants it .
Nobody understands it .
Money is the great taboo .
People just wo n't talk about it .
And that is what leads you to subprime .
Take the greed and the financial misrepresentation out of it , and the root of this crisis is massive levels of financial illiteracy . ”
For years John Bryant has been telling anyone who will listen about the problems caused by widespread ignorance of finance .
In 1992 , in the aftermath of the Los Angeles riots , he founded Operation HOPE , a non-profit organisation , to give poor people in the worst - hit parts of the city “ a hand - up , not a handout ” through a mixture of financial education , advice and basic banking .
Among other things , Operation HOPE offers mortgage advice to homebuyers and runs “ Banking on Our Future ” , a national personal - finance course of five hour - long sessions that has already been taken by hundreds of thousands of young people , most of them high - school students .
That many poor people do not have a bank account — and that few of them understand why this puts them at a disadvantage ( let alone other essentials of personal finance ) — is at the heart of “ the civil - rights issue of the 21st century ” , says Mr Bryant .
He calls the attempt to help people help themselves out of poverty through financial literacy and economic opportunity the “ silver - rights movement ” .
In January George Bush appointed Mr Bryant vice - chairman of his new President 's Council on Financial Literacy .
This was launched as part of his administration 's increasingly frenetic response to the financial crisis that followed the meltdown in subprime mortgages , many of them given to borrowers who may not have understood the risks .
Often borrowers did not even realise that their monthly payment would rise if interest rates went up , says Mr Bryant .
Subprime borrowers on adjustable interest rates , whose mortgages make up just 7 % of the total , accounted for more than 40 % of the foreclosures begun in the fourth quarter of last year ( see chart ) .
The council is not short of expertise .
It is chaired by Charles Schwab , eponymous boss of a broking firm .
Its other members include the head of Junior Achievement , which has been teaching children about money since 1919 , and a co-author of “ Rich Dad , Poor Dad ” , a self - help bestseller .
Already , it has approved a new curriculum for middle - school students , “ MoneyMath : Lessons for Life ” .
( Lesson one : the secret to becoming a millionaire .
Answer : save , save , save . )
It is starting a pilot programme to work out how to connect the “ unbanked ” to financial institutions .
And it is supporting what , echoing the Peace Corps , is called the Financial Literacy Corps : a group of people with knowledge of finance who will volunteer to advise those in financial difficulties .
April has been declared Financial Literacy Month by Congress .
The need to make this more than a slogan is especially apparent this year .
But America is not the only country where doing something about the widespread ignorance of personal finance is on the agenda .
Governments from Britain to Russia are declaring their commitment to financial education .
This month the World Savings Banks Institute , which represents retail and savings banks from 92 countries , will hold a summit in Brussels about financial education in the light of the subprime crisis .
Meanwhile , on March 17th a new campaign to promote financial literacy in the developing world was launched at a conference in Amsterdam .
Called Aflatoun ( “ Explorer ” ) , after a cartoon character based on a Bollywood star , it is the brainchild of Jeroo Billimoria , a social entrepreneur who previously worked with street children in India .
Among other things , she founded a successful emergency 24 - hour telephone service , called Childline .
She found that many of the children she helped were entrepreneurial ( indeed , such spirits may have played a part in their decision to leave home ) and became convinced that , given better education , they would have done well in life .
Ms Billimoria addresses herself to children aged between six and 14 , whom most educators consider too young to understand money .
Having begun with experiments in rural India , her non-profit organisation , Child Savings International , has piloted the Aflatoun course in 11 countries , including Argentina , South Africa , Vietnam and Zimbabwe , since 2005 .
It is now extending the course to 35 developing countries .
Only recently , after suggestions from the Dutch central bank and the European Commission , has Ms Billimoria started to adapt Aflatoun for rich countries such as Britain , the Netherlands , Ireland and perhaps America .
“ My mistake .
I never thought it would be needed in developed countries , ” she says .
If only .
Fools and their money
It is a “ well - established fact ” that “ a substantial proportion of the general public in the English - speaking world is ignorant of finance , ” writes Niall Ferguson , an historian at Harvard University , in his forthcoming book about the history of finance , “ The Ascent of Money ” .
He produces a long list of evidence to support this conclusion .
According to one survey last year , four in ten American credit - card holders do not pay the full amount due every month on the credit card they use most often , despite the punitive interest rates charged by credit - card companies .
Nearly one - third said they had no idea what the interest rate on their credit card was .
There is similar evidence elsewhere .
For instance , a survey in 2004 by Cambridge University and Prudential , a big insurer , found that some 9 m Britons are “ financially phobic ” , meaning that “ they shy away from anything to do with financial information , from bank statements to savings accounts to life assurance . ”
Research by the British regulator , the Financial Services Authority , found that one - quarter of adults did not realise that their pensions were invested in the stockmarket .
Financial illiteracy is not limited to subprime mortgage borrowers , then ; it is pervasive in all age groups , income brackets and countries .
“ Subprime is a mere symptom , ” says Mr Ferguson , noting that many of the students he has taught in the “ best universities in the world , including MBA programmes , do n't even know the difference between the nominal and real interest rate . ”
This problem is more pressing than ever , he adds , because governments and businesses have pushed more of the responsibility for financial well - being onto individuals , whether by encouraging homeownership or by promoting personally - managed retirement accounts rather than defined - benefit pensions .
The education system deserves much of the blame , says Mr Ferguson , who recalls having learnt nothing about personal finance at school in Scotland .
In the 2007 survey of American credit - card holders , over half of the respondents said they had learnt “ not too much ” or “ nothing at all ” about finance at school .
Americans still leave school not knowing much about money .
A sample of high - school pupils aged 17 or 18 gave correct answers to barely half of a set of questions about personal finance and economics posed in 2006 by researchers at the State University of New York , Buffalo .
Less than one - quarter knew that income tax could be levied on interest earned in a savings account .
Three - fifths did not know the difference between a company pension , Social Security and a 401 ( k ) savings account .
The same survey , undertaken every two years for Jump$tart , a coalition of 180 organisations in America that promote financial literacy , found that one in six had taken part in a course dedicated to personal finance .
A further one - third said they had learnt a bit from studying other subjects , such as business or economics .
Laura Levine , the head of Jump$tart and a member of Mr Bush 's financial - literacy council , says things are moving in the right direction , but that progress is slow .
The results of the 2008 survey , which are unlikely to show much change , are due to be published on April 9th .
At present only three American states require that students take a course in personal finance .
Another 15 insist that it be incorporated in other courses .
Beyond that , it is a case of persuading schools one at a time .
“ Personal - finance education is not a hard sell conceptually , ” says Ms Levine , “ but only when it comes to getting it prioritised . ”
School principals will usually agree that financial literacy is worth teaching , but they are reluctant to give it time and resources .
Even when personal finance is taught , the right lessons are not necessarily learnt .
“ Wherever you look in America or the OECD , classes in financial literacy do n't do much good , ” says Lewis Mandell , an economist at Buffalo .
“ As an educator , I 'd like to believe you can teach people to do anything right , but clearly the way we are going about teaching personal finance needs to be improved . ”
To Mr Mandell 's frustration , the only classroom method that seems consistently to raise financial literacy among high - school pupils is playing a stockmarket - investing game — which rewards taking high - risk bets .
Most other approaches tend to show only short - term increases in financial literacy , he says .
According to Mr Mandell , one problem is that if financial literacy is taught , it tends to be before a student 's final year — before she has faced any important financial decisions , such as buying a car or taking out a credit card .
Another is that teachers are often financially illiterate , too .
Financial literacy may be less about acquiring knowledge than forming good habits , something that is arguably better done before high school , let alone adulthood .
This is where Aflatoun comes in .
Ms Billimoria encountered a great deal of scepticism when she developed her financial - literacy programme for six - to 14 - year - olds .
Yet she was convinced that starting with youngsters would be more effective , because that is “ when their concept of themselves is developing and by 14 most of their habits have formed . ”
An important part of the teaching is getting the children to start saving , ideally by opening bank accounts .
Typically , they have only tiny amounts , but this is enough to get them used to handling money properly .
At first this faced a lot of resistance , as people asked , “ How can young children handle money ? ” recalls Ms Billimoria , but “ it soon caught on and parents started giving children money to save . ”
To demonstrate its broad applicability , Aflatoun was piloted in economies beset by different difficulties .
Zimbabwe , for example , was selected for its astronomical inflation rate .
The course was adapted to encourage children to save by buying assets such as pencils , which , unlike the country 's money , could be a store of value .
A nudge in the right direction
“ The depressing truth is that financial literacy is impossible , at least for many of the big financial decisions all of us have to take , ” says Richard Thaler , a behavioural economist at the University of Chicago .
Aptly for someone who has built his career on the study of irrational financial behaviour , Mr Thaler admits that even he finds it hard to know the right thing to do .
“ If these things are perplexing to people with PhDs in economics , financial literacy is not the right road to go down . ”
Instead , policymakers should “ focus on making the world easier ” , he argues in a new book , “ Nudge : Improving Decisions About Health , Wealth and Happiness ” , written with Cass Sunstein , a law professor ( and an adviser to Barack Obama ) .
By this he means defining more carefully and simply the financial choices that people have to make , and building “ sensible default options ” into the design of financial products , so that the do - nothing option is “ financially literate ” .
Today , the best choice typically requires some working out and an active decision .
This does not mean that the same choice is right for everyone .
The growing complexity of financial choices in part reflects remarkable innovation , much of which has benefited consumers .
As Operation HOPE 's Mr Bryant points out , thanks to the availability of subprime mortgages , “ homeownership has lifted many poor people out of poverty ; the challenge is to make the product better . ”
Sweden 's system of saving for old age contains an example of what Mr Thaler means .
It offers Swedes a choice of funds to invest in , but includes a well - designed low - cost default option , which has become the choice of 90 % of the people .
The same approach might be taken to America 's company 401 ( k ) retirement plans , in which today 's choices require a high degree of financial literacy .
Employees might also be automatically enrolled in savings plans , with a right to opt out , instead of today 's under - used opt-ins .
Mr Thaler deserves to be taken seriously , as one of his earlier attempts to apply behavioural economics to saving has had impressive results .
Recognising that people find it harder to save money they already possess than to promise to put aside what they might have one day , he designed the Save More Tomorrow scheme , which gets people to commit themselves to saving a slice of any future pay increases .
Where implemented , the plan has already brought about sharp increases in saving rates .
Another idea would make it easier for people to choose a suitable credit card , by obliging card companies to supply customers with two downloadable files , perhaps once a year .
One would explain the issuer 's charging rules ; the other would list the charges the consumer has actually incurred .
The consumer could then upload this to one of several websites that Mr Thaler believes would soon appear .
With one click , the most suitable card would be recommended .
A similar system could work for America 's Medicare prescription programme , in which preliminary research suggests that matching the drugs a person needs with the right insurance plan would save on average $ 700 a year , he says .
Better product design and financial education need not be alternatives , points out Mr Mandell .
They can work in tandem .
He is enthusiastic about schemes such as the Child Trust Funds introduced in Britain .
These “ baby bonds ” give every child a fund that matures at adulthood , letting everyone start out with a nest - egg .
Mr Mandell is particularly excited by the curriculum being designed to be taught in conjunction with these funds , starting when children reach the age of seven .
“ Teachers will be able to talk about money realistically , because the kids will have ownership of wealth . ”
If you can make it there
One of the most interesting attempts to combine teaching and superior products is taking place in New York , championed by a mayor , Michael Bloomberg , who made his fortune selling financial information .
He has created an Office of Financial Empowerment , which is trying to use the powers of government to promote both financial education and better design of financial products .
The city 's regulatory powers mean that it can crack down on firms that exploit financial literacy , and educate the public at the same time , says Jonathan Mintz , New York 's Commissioner of Consumer Affairs .
It has found that many tax - preparation agencies are offering “ rapid refunds ” which , as many consumers do not realise , are in fact loans in anticipation of refunds .
Its publicity blitz about these loans led to coverage on news programmes “ in 22 states and Canada ” , allowing the city to promote the message that “ anyone promising a tax refund within two days is selling a loan — do n't do it . ”
Another initiative is to use the city 's system of helping people to apply for the earned income - tax credit as a chance to encourage them to open a bank account .
As well as explaining to applicants the importance of saving , the city is working with banks to offer carefully designed accounts , and has even persuaded some philanthropists to provide matching funds for the first $ 250 someone saves .
“ You are not just educating me , you are allowing me to nod my head and say yes , and get a windfall , ” says Mr Mintz .
“ Financial education is much more effective when it is connected to something real that is happening . ”
With Miami , San Antonio , San Francisco , Savannah and Seattle , New York has formed the Cities for Financial Empowerment Coalition , which met for the first time to share ideas on March 18th .
There was general agreement that education and better product design should go hand in hand .
Most big banks have started to sponsor financial - literacy efforts , if only to cover their backs .
However , Mr Mandell remarks , by increasing the charges for bank accounts with only small balances they have in effect deprived children of what was traditionally the best practical educational tool , an account of their own .
Indeed , one of the biggest problems may be the illiteracy of financial - service firms , which often fail to provide the products that poor consumers most want .
That , at least , seems to be the conclusion of a recent survey in two of New York 's poorer neighbourhoods .
Many people were using fringe financial products such as pay - day loans or money orders rather than the services of mainstream banks .
The mainstream financial providers are “ missing genuine markets ” , says Mr Mintz .
“ One of the open secrets in this industry is that when people are engaged in behaviour that seems irrational , often it has a rational basis . ”
Which only goes to show that consumers are sometimes only as literate as the products the financial - services industry chooses to sell them .
Mr Bryant makes the same point more colourfully , noting that some of the first people to be hit by the subprime - mortgage crisis were the very brokers who had sold people inappropriate mortgages .
Having drunk their own Kool - Aid , they found themselves with enormous debts and no job .
“ It takes less credentials to be a mortgage broker than a pimp on a street corner in Harlem , ” he says .
“ Because a pimp needs references . ”
Many online games have tried to tackle the trade in game gold Nearly 500,000 people in developing nations earn a wage making virtual goods in online games to sell to players , a study has found .
Research by Manchester University shows that the practice , known as gold - farming , is growing rapidly .
The industry , about 80 % based in China , employs about 400,000 people who earn £ 77 per month on average .
The practice is flourishing despite efforts by games companies to crack down on the trade in virtual goods .
Big industry Professor Richard Heeks , head of the development informatics group at Manchester who wrote the report , said gold farming had become a significant economic sector in many developing nations .
" I initially became aware of gold farming through my own games - playing but assumed it was just a cottage industry , " said Professor Richard Heeks from the University of Manchester who wrote the report .
" In a way that is still true .
It 's just that instead of a few dozen cottages , there turn out to be tens of thousands . "
In many online games virtual cash remains rare and many people turn to suppliers such as gold farmers to get money to outfit avatars with better gear , weapons or a mount .
Many gold farmers focus on World of Warcraft Some gold - farming operations offer other services such as " power levelling " in which they assume control of a player 's character and turn it into a high - powered hero far faster than the original owner could manage themselves .
Prof
Heeks said very accurate figures for the size of the gold farming sector were hard to come by but his work suggested that in 2008 it employs 400,000 people who earn an average of $ 145 ( £ 77 ) per month creating a global market worth about $ 500 m .
But , he said , the true size of the sector was hard to estimate - it could easily be twice as big .
The quasi-criminal nature of gold - farming made it hard to truly gauge its extent , said Prof Heeks .
In most online games all the activities associated with gold farming - gathering in - game cash to items to sell , buying game gold or sharing accounts - are a violation of the terms governing that title .
Anyone caught engaging in any of these activities is likely to be banned from the game and have their account shut down .
" I was drawn to write about gold farming due to my perception that it's a significant phenomenon that academics and development organisations are unaware of , " he told the BBC .
Already , he said , gold farming was comparable in size to India 's outsourcing industry .
You could get rid of it , but you would get rid of one of the most fundamental parts of player - to - player interaction .
Steve Davis , Secure Play
" The Indian software employment figure probably crossed the 400,000 mark in 2004 and is now closer to 900,000 , " said Prof Heeks .
" Nonetheless , the two are still comparable in employment size , yet not at all in terms of profile . "
Prof Heeks suspects gold - farming might be an early example of the " virtual offshoring " likely to become more prevalent as people spend more time working and playing in cyberspace .
" It is also a glimpse into the digital underworld , " he said .
" Or at least the edges of a digital underworld populated by scammers and hackers and pornographers and which has spread to the " Third World " far more than we typically realise . "
Cashing out Steven Davis , chief of game security firm Secure Play , said gold farming had been around since the earliest days of online gaming but had mushroomed along with the popularity of gaming .
The trade was clearly meeting a real need , he said .
Economic depth in games such as Eve Online means it is not as prone to gold farming " When you get people with more money than time and time than money the two will find a way to meet , " he said .
While exchanges of goods and gold take place inside game worlds the deals are typically done via one of many hundreds of online market places and shops .
Some gold farming sites employ just a handful of people but many were large businesses with hundreds of people on their books .
A hierarchy of gold farmers arranged by where wages were lowest was starting to emerge , said Mr Davis .
For instance , the low wages gold farmers in Vietnam will accept means they now do for Chinese gamers what many in China do for those in the West .
" It 's moving down the chain , " he said .
Gold - farming was proving so lucrative that criminal gangs were cashing in on it , said Mr Davis .
These pay for their accounts with stolen credit cards , take money from players and do not hand over gold or goods in return and fill chat channels with adverts for websites hawking game gold .
There were also significant problems in tracking down and prosecuting those behind the gold - farming , he said .
Games makers had tried to limit the amount of trade in game gold and gear , few had reported significant success , said Mr Davis .
" You could get rid of it , " he said , " but you would get rid of one of the most fundamental parts of player - to - player interaction . "

What are these ?
We 've seen Lenovo beefing up its consumer offerings of late , but this is really taking it up a notch .
The company just announced its very first netbook , the recently spotted 10.2 - inch , Atom - powered little wonder .
Sadly , there 's little of note in the design -- it seems to have more in common with the MSI Wind and the Eee PC than its Lenovo siblings -- but the $ 399 starting price is certainly pleasing .
That model brings 512MB of RAM and a 80GB hard drive , while a $ 450 version will be available with 1GB of RAM and 160GB of storage , with both being powered by 1.6GHz Atom chipsets .
Windows XP will be preloaded initially , but Linpus versions will be available eventually .
The display is 1024 x 600 and LED backlit , and the touchpad does multi-touch .
Lenovo did n't skimp on the trimmings either , with WiFi , Bluetooth , ExpressCard , 4 - in - 1 card reader and a 1.3 megapixel webcam .
The S10 hits China on September 5th , and will land in the States in early October .
A 9 - inch version is also in the works for other countries .

In 1998 the Kawakawa Community Board was looking to upgrade 40 - year - old toilet facilities in the central township , and Hundertwasser offered a solution from his design palate .
His concept was adopted and construction was completed early this year , with the artist personally lending a hand in construction supervision , including the provision of materials from his own studio .
Hundertwasser was in fact more involved in construction than he was in the world - renown Hundertwasser House apartments project in Vienna .
In consultation with the Bay of Islands College , students prepared ceramic tiles which have been used throughout the building .
The bricks used came from a former Bank of New Zealand building , and both young and old from the local community volunteered services to the construction process .
The finished product is a work of art , from the grass roof , to gold balls , ceramic tiles , bottle glass windows , mosaic tiling , copper handwork , cobblestone flooring , individual sculptures and a living tree integrated into the design structure .
With the untimely death of the Austrian - born artist in February 2000 , the building is the only Hundertwasser structure in the Southern Hemisphere , and the last major project ever undertaken by the famous artist and designer .
It will remain as both a memorial to Frederick Hundertwasser and a very functional building for the community and visitors alike .
So impressive has been the final result that Creative New Zealand gave the project the “ premier ” certificate in the Creative Places Awards 2000 contest .
The results were announced at the Local Government New Zealand conference at Christchurch earlier this year .
In making the award Creative New Zealand chairperson Peter Biggs said : - “ This project was initiated by a rural community in a district that has faced many challenges .
Yet the Far North has realised a magnificent , integrated project which stands out as a gleaming example to the rest of New Zealand . ”
The Hundertwasser toilet project was also the Urban and Landscape Design category winner in the awards .
The building is now arguably the most photographed “ public loo ” in New Zealand , and possibly in the world .
The Department of Defense ( DoD ) Office of Force Transformation ( OFT ) approached the Naval Research Laboratory ( NRL ) with an opportunity to build and launch a micro-satellite , of the 100 - kilogram class , to provide a platform for a host of technology and operational experiments .
A key challenge posed to the Laboratory by OFT was to build this capability in less than one year .
Bringing this first TacSat vision together required the development of new partnerships and methods as well as the leveraging of existing hardware , software and facilities .
Figure 1 . TacSat - 1 Spacecraft , Solar Arrays Deployed , Nadir ( Earth - Facing ) Side Facing Up Copperfield - 2 , a sensor system developed by the author 's team for the Navy , became the cornerstone of the TacSat - 1 payload infrastructure .
The Copperfield - 2 sensor system ( Figure 2 ) originally was designed for use on unmanned aerial vehicles ( UAVs ) — a good match for adaptation to a space mission , as many of the design requirements are similar .
A satellite bus can be thought of as the spacecraft vehicle .
It provides the physical and electrical infrastructure to support the payload .
The satellite payload is the sensor or experiment being carried by the bus .
TacSat - 1 used a bus originally designed for use in the ORBCOMM constellation of small communications satellites .
If Copperfield - 2 was flown on an aircraft or UAV , that platform would serve as a bus , providing infrastructure to the payload .
Figure 2 . TacSat - 1 Copperfield - 2 Payload Block Diagram
Modular Payload Hardware Design
The first hardware version of the Copperfield payload was designed from legacy hardware systems and was adapted to allow the original hardware to operate through an Ethernet - connected TCP / IP interface .
When trades were made before designing the second - generation experimental capability , various bus standards , commercial off - the - shelf ( COTS ) emerging capabilities and other factors were considered .
We decided to pursue a 3U CompactPCI architecture to allow maximum flexibility of the physical form factor ( Figure 3 ) .
However , we decided to use a custom PCI motherboard so the CompactPCI user - defined P2 connector pins could be used for our own purposes .
This results in a motherboard with slots that support our custom - designed hardware , slots that support COTS Ethernet switch cards and slots that can accommodate cards built to the PXI standard .
The resulting architecture blends standard CompactPCI with Ethernet connectivity available by way of the P2 backplane .
Figure 3 . TacSat - 1 Copperfield - 2 CompactPCI Cardset and Chassis
Modular Standards - Based Payload Architecture
Few satellite programs have the latitude or the ability to take the risks that the TacSat - 1 experiment has .
The TacSat - 1 experiment allows innovative leveraging of both government off - the - shelf ( GOTS ) and COTS hardware components , as well as novel approaches to creating payload software that provide maximum flexibility and standards - based operation .
The risk philosophy allowed the utilization of a modular payload hardware .
Identically , a modular software and communication system was expanded for TacSat - 1 , extending the role of standards - based open - source software such that it provides reusable software infrastructure suitable for flexible command and control of the TacSat - 1 payload .
The Copperfield - 2 payload architecture was intended to provide as much flexibility as possible .
It is a testament to the flexibility of the architecture that extension of the UAV payload to a space application was possible .
Because the payload software components are not space - flight critical , meaning the health and safety of the spacecraft does not depend on its reliability , much of the software can be leveraged across air and space platforms .
Linux Kernel as the Foundation From the beginning of Copperfield - 2 development , it was our desire to capitalize on the momentum , capability and availability of Linux source code .
With the development of the processor card with its PowerPC PowerQuicc II , the hardware infrastructure was in place to support a robust embedded system .
The accessibility of source was a paramount feature that allowed us to recover from various situations we encountered , including board layout errors .
Although the board design was made to look similar to the Motorola reference design — MPC8620ADS - PCI , which no longer is available — some ambiguities , hardware limitations and other issues necessitated changes to the kernel .
When TacSat - 1 development began , many seasoned veterans questioned the choice of Linux as host to the payload control software .
Proprietary real - time operating systems typically have been used for space systems developed at NRL .
During the architectural design process , no hard real - time requirements were discovered , revalidating the original choice of Linux for Copperfield - 2 and , thus , also for TacSat - 1 .
Beyond the tweaks necessary to get Linux working correctly with our hardware , only three device drivers were written — one to support the sensor data format ; one to interface with the Xilinx SystemAce , a Compact Flash interface device that can be used to load FPGAs and also be used for OS storage ; and one on the PowerPC 823 HSI interface box communicating with the FPGA .
Due to the large Xilinx Virtex - II mapped to the memory space of our PowerPC processor , some innovation was required to handle device driver development in the face of changing FPGA designs .
Don Kremer at Aeronix developed a series of utilities that can read Verilog source files and create myriad macros , C code and even HTML documentation that allow the Verilog hardware specification essentially to write the majority of the necessary drivers .
Networking Architecture of COTS Processors
The core Copperfield - 2 payload processor provides two key functions for the mission .
First , it is a sensor system that receives sensed data , processes the data and interacts with onboard communications equipment to transmit the results to other sensors and ground stations .
Secondly , it serves as a general - purpose computer system that provides the infrastructure for storage and data handling .
In fact , multiple general - purpose processors are part of the Copperfield - 2 payload , each communicating by way of an Ethernet network .
A COTS Ethernet switch serves as the center of the star Ethernet architecture .

Gateway to the Bus Legacy Equipment
To capitalize on the Ethernet , TCP / IP , standards - based architecture of the UAV payload while remaining compatible with the satellite bus ' legacy OX.25 interfaces — which provide a means for downlinking science data and state - of - health telemetry — a different embedded computer module was designed specifically to serve as the bridge .
This module is called the high - speed interface ( HSI ) and provides a 2 MB synchronous serial bus connected to the spacecraft communication controller .
The HSI hardware is implemented as a combination of FPGA hardware and a BSE ipEngine general - purpose PowerPC 823 embedded processor .
In the HSI , the FPGA provides the hardware necessary to meet timing requirements for the data link , decoupling the processor from the synchronous data link .
The PowerPC runs a Linux 2.4 - based kernel , and the HSI FPGA interface is implemented as a standard Linux device driver .
No special real - time extensions are used , and a Linux - based application provides the interface between the TCP / IP networking stack , using standard protocols and the device driver implementation .
The HSI system allows multiple processes and Ethernet - connected computers to access the data stream sent to the spacecraft .
The PowerPC communications controller on the Copperfield - 2 processor easily could have handled the HSI tasks on TacSat - 1 .
However , due to the extremely limited availability of hardware and the desire to increase parallel development opportunities , this interface was developed independently .
Rapid Payload Software Development with Existing Tools
The most “ custom ” part in any satellite program often is the payload control software .
Because many of the Copperfield - 2 payload components with processors run Linux , interesting software options are available .
Much of the payload software was implemented as bash ( Bourne again shell ) scripts .
During the rapid development of the payload software , the philosophy was to attempt to divide the software development into two parts , custom and reused software modules .
This philosophy called for minimizing custom code to limited functions and programs with specific purposes .
Occasionally , we did find that existing utilities did not quite fit the requirements , and these were modified or replacements were written .
These specific custom programs and drivers allowed for control of payload elements through small command - line utilities that could be tested completely and easily in their limited functionality .
These programs were developed with the UNIX command - line functionality in mind , along with data input through standard in ( STDIN ) and data output through standard out ( STDOUT ) .
Developing software utilities with interfaces such as these in mind has been the standard for many legacy operating system concepts from the earliest UNIX developments .
We intended to continue that strategy and build upon it , as it provides an amazingly flexible way of constructing thorough capabilities with simple although powerful utilities .
GNU and Open - Source Utilities
The first step in designing the software architecture was to examine what tools already were available to the developers — in this case , parts of the Linux distribution and other GNU and open - source utilities with well - defined pedigrees that provided needed capabilities .
Time and time again , as we were developing the payload control software , we were amazed at the flexibility and amazing number of options that various commands provide .
One example is the GNU compression utility gzip .
During a ground contact event , the payload streams data in real time through a series of software pipes .
It originates in a file located on the Flash filesystem and then makes its way through various utilities , including a compression stage , and into the satellite bus .
We found that it was necessary to tune gzip to select a compression ratio / performance curve that would ensure that the 1MB downlink was filled completely with data packets .
gzip inserted into the downlink stream was a relatively late addition , and it allows us to make maximum use of the available downlink bandwidth .
The design of command - line utilities using STDIN / STDOUT interfaces allows capabilities such as this to be integrated transparently into the data stream , within the performance capability of our computer system .
Listing 1 . Downlink Pipeline Demonstrating tar , gzip and netcat # Configure the file download pipeline tar - cf - $ {downloadFileList} | gzip -c -l | \ file_downloader - tqid $ {target_qid} -rlp \ $ {return_link_path} \ - dri $ {dump_request_id} \ - fmt $ {dataFormat} | \ netcat localhost $ {!returnLinkService}
Payload Control Subsystem — with bash Choosing a scripting language is a difficult task — indeed , in the Open Source community , many competent options are available .
Perl may have been a good choice , but we were not comfortable with the size of its installation and memory footprint .
Python also would have been a great choice , but the development team did not have experience with it .
The most powerful shell - scripting language appeared to be bash , although it also is the heaviest in terms of footprint .
Our smallest embedded systems could not handle the entire footprint of bash , but the Busybox lightweight shell - scripting interpreter , ASH , proved almost as capable for the tasks that had to be monitored and controlled on those smaller targets .
Although space here does not allow for a complete architecture discussion of the payload control software design , at its core the software is a series of bash scripts designed to support various functions of the payload .
The system is designed to take advantage of POSIX - style filesystem security .
Upon boot , the first processes run as root as the system starts .
As the payload control software begins to come on - line , it starts up as user BOOT .
The system can stay in BOOT and provide a certain number of critical system capabilities , including providing binary telemetry streams , file transfers and direct commands .
When a sensor mission is about to begin , the system moves to a state of TRANSITION , and all further data collections take place as the OPS user , who has a different set of permissions .
At the conclusion of the data collection , OPS is commanded to shut down .
Multiple redundant copies of the BOOT directories are designed into the system to provide backup capability in the case of filesystem corruption or other significant error .
bash scripts launch every payload control system function .
They create complex filenames we use to keep track of configuration , date and time and other information .
They un-gzip and untar commands and files that are uplinked to the satellite .
Commands themselves also are bash scripts with simplified functionalities .
They call other bash scripts to do the actual data collection or to set environment variables that change the behavior of other scripts .
Listing 2 . Sensor Data Processing Pipeline #
Start the data processing pipeline # ( with cpf ignoring SIGINT , SIGTERM ) eval " cat $ dig_data_stream | \ tee $ raw_file | \ cpf - i -v$cpf_verbosity $ cpfparams \ > $ output_file & " #
Enable the dig channel set_hardware ' echo $ dig_channel \ channelEnable ena | mapper 2 >&1 '
This combination of the bash scripting language , GNU and open - source utilities and custom command - line applications is unique in satellite programs .
For TacSat - 1 , most of the custom code involves the conversion of data from the TCP / IP world to proprietary OX.25 formats to handle sensor data .

Distributed Development and Collaboration
The extensive use of TCP / IP - based systems and the common Linux operating system provided unique opportunities for a distributed development environment .
Early in TacSat - 1 , our custom PowerPC 8260 development hardware had limited availability .
The design cycle for much of the payload software began on Intel x86 - based computer systems , migrated to generic PowerPC embedded processors and eventually made its way to the final target .
The software design team was distributed spatially and tied together through a virtual private network ( VPN ) architecture .
Remote power control devices allowed developers who were operating off - site to cycle power on hardware components .
A Web - based collaboration tool allowed the posting and dissemination of critical communications and interconnection control documents ( ICDs ) .
Some developers also used instant messaging technology to stay in contact with one another .
Recent additions to the collaborative working environment include the use of E - Log to maintain an on - line database of lessons learned .
We also are working to integrate Bugzilla capability into the system to replace our relatively crude Message Forum - based problem report ( PR ) tracking .
The TCP / IP nature of the payload data network allowed developers to test communications between payload elements at each step in the design process , from developing on a standard PC to final communications before inserting the custom hardware required to communicate with the bus .
Even after complete integration of the payload into the bus , an Ethernet test port allowed network access to the satellite , which was invaluable for collaborative debugging of the system .
Test ports also allow access to serial consoles for most of the payload components and , in some cases , JTAG or other hardware debugging ports .
The payload software design team consisted of experienced satellite and ground station software experts , as well as team members accustomed to the TCP / IP data transport and Web / CGI application development , plus embedded systems experts .
Although quite different from the typical satellite software design team , this combination provided nearly the perfect balance of skills and innovative methods to maximize the use of existing software designed for aircraft applications .
The extensive remote collaboration , interface testing and networking capability provided a smooth bus -payload integration .
The core of the payload control software , including many of the command and control scripts , were developed in a span of less than four months , from start to finish .
Additional scripts were inserted into the core payload control software infrastructure to bring on - line additional sensor capabilities as those sensors became available .
New capabilities and patches may be uploaded to the satellite as requirements dictate .
Conclusion
Few satellite programs have the sponsor - supplied latitude or the ability to take risks that the TacSat - 1 initiative provides .
In this context , the TacSat - 1 program allows innovative leveraging of both GOTS and COTS hardware components , as well as novel approaches to creating payload software that provides maximum flexibility and standards - based operation .
The modular nature of the Copperfield - 2 allowed rapid hardware integration , proving the concept of a modular payload that scales from UAV applications to a spacecraft application , all using Linux and GNU software as a foundation .
At the time of this writing , TacSat - 1 was scheduled to launch in February 2005 .
Danica Patrick Sports Illustrated Cover ' Indy , Yes She Can ' ( Photos )
The Brickyard will host the Indy 500 on Sunday , May 25th .
Danica Patrick will be one of 33 drivers vying for a big win .
She is currently enjoying her career high fifth place points ranking following her first victory in Japan in April , making her the first female winner in the history of the Indy Racing League .
Danica , 5 ' 2 " and 100 pounds , has been voted the sport 's most popular driver three years running .
The 26 year old is poised to make history again this weekend , and would love to take the traditional swig of milk after winning the sports biggest race .
It would be the motor sports story of the year and a spectacular achievement by a woman if Danica wins the race .
She will start in fifth position .
Patrick has raced three times at the Brickyard , finishing in 8th spot or better each time .
She drives for Andretti Green Racing .
Co-owner Kevin Savoree said :
When we considered Danica , we talked about that she could win the Indy 500 , and that 's why we hired her .
She had a lot of marketability , but we hired her because she could win there . "
How does Patrick excel at a track that is considered among the most technically demanding because of its flat layout , sharp corners and 225 - mph speeds ?
According to Kim Green :
We 've given her cars even this month that were maybe too unstable , and she does n't come back ranting and raving .
I 'm so impressed with how calm she is . "
Danica is screaming hot right now .
She is glamorous and photogenic and has a broad fan base , appealing to kids and their parents .
John Griffin , vice president of public relations for the Indy Racing League , said that the week after her victory in Japan , Patrick sold more than $ 100,000 worth of merchandise .
On Sunday at Noon EST over 300,000 race fans will be on hand to witness the race .
Danica does n't claim to be psychic but she had this to say about her chances of winning :
I 'm not the only one who says it could be my year .
But I 've got a good feeling . "

" Did they base this loan on the fact that , even if he lost , he would still be a sitting senator and able to raise money ? " she asked .
" In my mind , that raises questions about whether he complied with Senate ethics rules , " which bar members from using their position to negotiate financial terms that an average citizen could not .
Last November when the McCain campaign had been declared dead by his media base ( where ’s the love ? ) , McCain managed to negotiate a sweetheart deal with the Fidelity & Trust Bank in Maryland for a life saving loan to his campaign .
The $ 3 million line of credit was secured by his fundraising list and the highly unusual requirement that he take out a life insurance policy in case he did not survive the campaign .
With Crucial Loan , McCain Put His Bid Back in the Black - washingtonpost.com
Last year McCain carved out a loophole in the law to exempt aircraft owned by a candidate or his family or by privately held company they control .
This loophole allowed McCain to use his millionaire heiress wife ’s private corporate jet at a substantial savings to his campaign .
McCain Frequently Used Wife ’s Jet for Little Cost - New York Times
“ Last summer , just before starting to use his wife ’s plane , Mr. McCain was quoted in a newspaper report as saying that he did not plan to tap her substantial wealth to keep his bid for the Republican presidential nomination going . ”
But boss , what about “ Zee plane !
Zee plane ! ”
Or maybe McCain never really cared all that much about campaign finance reform in the first place .
McCain 's commitment to public financing questioned - The Boston Globe His reputation as a campaign finance reformer is largely a media myth created by what McCain affectionately calls “ his base . ”
Apparently everyone has kissed and made up over the Roberts ’ Court striking down a big chunk of the McCain - Feingold Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act ( BCRA ) .
This past Tuesday , John McCain pandered to the GOP conservative base by vowing to appoint conservative activist judges like John Roberts , Jr. and Samuel Alito to the Supreme Court .
McCain praised the justices as role models for the judges he would appoint to the court .
Shortly before the New Hampshire primary , McCain returned to the bank to request an additional $ 1 million .
The bank wanted more than his campaign assets as collateral .
McCain promised that if his campaign faltered , he would commit to keeping his campaign alive and to reapply to the federal financing system so the money he raised could be used to gain an infusion of matching funds .
Had that happened , he would have been forced to abide by strict federal spending caps .
McCain Got Loan by Pledging to Seek Federal Funds - washingtonpost.com
According to the loan documents filed with the FEC , McCain agreed that if he did not win New Hampshire or place within ten percent , he would stay in the race for 30 days to reapply for public matching funds , and use that public money to pay off his private loan .
( This is your tax dollars at work ) .
McCain also agreed to stay within the spending limits to remain eligible for public matching funds , and he would not “ break the limits without asking the bank first . ”
McCain pledged his certificate of eligibility for public financing as security for this loan .
He also used his certificate of eligibility to gain automatic access to the ballot in several primary states including Ohio , and bypass the time consuming process and expense of gathering petition signatures to qualify for the ballot , as his GOP primary opponents did .
McCain thus materially benefited from his certificate of eligibility for public financing .
After winning New Hampshire , McCain was able to raise campaign cash and did not need to tap into the public financing .
After having gamed the system , McCain ’s campaign notified the FEC that it would withdraw from public financing .
Not so fast .
It ’s not that simple .
FEC Chairman David M. Mason ( a Republican appointee ) notified the McCain campaign that the FEC must approve a candidate ’s withdrawal from public financing .
The FEC had questions it wanted answered about McCain ’s sweetheart loan .
But the FEC currently only has two members and does not have a quorum to conduct official business .
FEC Warns McCain on Campaign Spending
The McCain campaign response was essentially “ we do n’t need no stinkin’ FEC permission , ” and ignored the FEC , vowing it would continue to raise and spend money without limitation .
By signing up for the matching funds , McCain had agreed to adhere to strict state - by - state spending limits and an overall limit on spending of $ 54 million for the primary season , which lasts until the party 's nominating convention in September .
McCain has since blown past the primary spending limit .
Every dime he spends is a violation of the spending limit .
The Democratic Party filed a complaint in February with the FEC , alleging McCain materially benefited from his certificate of eligibility for public financing and he would exceed the primary spending limits .
The Democratic Party | DNC to File Complaint Against McCain Campaign for Ignoring FEC Law ; The Democratic Party | Democratic Party Files Complaint Against McCain for Ignoring FEC Law .
Like McCain ’s letter of withdrawal to the FEC , however , the FEC lacked a quorum to act upon the complaint .
Because of the FEC impasse , the Democratic Party filed a lawsuit on April 14 , 2008 , asking the U.S. District Court to review whether McCain ’s attempt to withdraw from public financing violated the law .
DNC Files Lawsuit Against McCain Over Public Financing - Politics on The Huffington Post The FEC has 60 days to respond to the lawsuit .
Now McCain ’s “ best friend for life ” George Bush is attempting to stack the FEC with commissioners who will resolve this dispute in his favor .
Bush is seeking to purge FEC Chairman David M. Mason for being responsible enough to question the funding machinations of McCain ’s campaign .
In F.E.C. Moves , Some See Effort to Aid McCain - New York Times Bush proposes to replace him with Donald McGahn , formerly an RNC campaign counsel and the ethics lawyer for Tom DeLay .
As Bob Bauer points out at the Campaign Finance Law Guide Campaign Finance Law Guide : More Soft Money Hard Law ( Bob Bauer ) :
“ For this maneuver to have been arranged for the benefit of Senator McCain , of all people -- the John McCain who has regularly , severely criticized the FEC as a " corrupt " agency -- is a remarkable turn in his career as a reformer .
A Commissioner who acted to enforce the law , to just raise an important question of enforcement , has been stripped of his post .
This was clearly in Senator McCain 's interest , this raw power play .
It is also in his interest to have the FEC , back in business minus Mason , arrange for his money for the fall campaign . ”
McCain has a pecuniary interest in restoring the FEC .
Without official action by the commission , McCain cannot receive his $ 85 million in public financing for the general election .
Without a functioning FEC he would need either a court order or an act of Congress to amend the statute so he could receive the money .
In F.E.C. Moves , Some See Effort to Aid McCain - New York Times
McCain has been cynically baiting Barack Obama about agreeing to accept public financing for the general election , but without a functioning FEC there would be no public financing of the general election .
McCain ’s anemic fundraising to date will be obliterated by the Obama campaign ’s far superior fundraising capability on a ratio of 3 - 1 , perhaps even 4 - 1 .
So now McCain desperately needs a functioning FEC stacked in his favor .
“ In this one move , the White House ended McCain ’s accountability for his use or abuse of the primary public financing system while putting him in position to take money for the general , ” said Bob Bauer .
McCain is also attempting to skirt the $ 2,300 maximum contribution limit set by campaign finance laws with his new “ McCain Victory ‘ 08 ” fund .
The joint entity combines the McCain campaign , the RNC , and four state entities ( Wisconsin , Minnesota , Colorado and New Mexico so far ) , in a “ hybrid legal structure . ”
Washington Wire - WSJ.com : New McCain Fund Gets Around Donation Limits
The new structure allows up to $ 70,000 in individual contributions by channeling the money into different McCain - centric funds .
So a handful of his super - wealthy friends intend to make up for McCain 's lack of popular support among small donors ?
Is n't this the kind of influence that campaign finance reform was meant to eliminate ?
Finally , Judicial Watch has filed a complaint with the FEC accusing McCain of improperly accepting donations from the Rothschild family at a recent fundraising luncheon at London ’s Spencer House to benefit McCain ’s presidential campaign .
U.S. political campaigns are prohibited from accepting contributions from foreign nationals .

Where are the usual suspects on the right howling about foreigners influencing our elections , i.e. , Buddhist Temple fundraiser , Norman Hsu , etc . ?
Billionaire Brits are still foreigners under the law .
So there you have it .
The truth is that “ Mr. Campaign Finance Reform ” is a fraud .
May this media myth be laid to rest forever .
US has little influence in Georgia crisis , Rice wo n't interrupt holiday Agence France - Presse
Published : Monday August 11 , 2008
Print This Email This WASHINGTON ( AFP )  Washington has little room for maneuver in the Caucasus conflict amid perceptions that it helped fuel the crisis by over - inflating Georgia 's hopes of US support for its young democracy , analysts say .
" This is probably a conflict where the United States would not be accepted by both sides as a mediator , " said analyst Steven Pifer , a former US ambassador in Kiev .
" The Georgians would welcome American participation .
I suspect the Russians would probably not accept us because in Moscow , we are seen as too close to Georgia , " added the analyst from the Brookings Institute .
US President George W. Bush Monday condemned the Russian military offensive against Georgia , triggered after Tbilisi sent troops into the pro-Moscow rebel region of South Ossetia seeking to regain control from the separatists .
" I said this violence is unacceptable , " Bush told US broadcaster NBC .
" I expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of Russia and that we strongly condemn bombing outside of South Ossetia . "
But Bush is acutely aware that Washington needs Moscow 's support on several key outstanding international dossiers including the crisis over Iran 's suspect nuclear program and moves to denuclearize North Korea .
In a plaintive reminder to the United States of its support for his 2003 Rose Revolution , Georgia 's staunchly pro-Western President Mikheil Saakashvili sought to remind his ally of how far Tbilisi has come in the past few years .
" No country of the former Soviet Union has made more progress toward consolidating democracy , eradicating corruption and building an independent foreign policy than Georgia , " he wrote Monday in the Wall Street Journal .
" This conflict is therefore about our common trans - Atlantic values of liberty and democracy , " wrote the Georgian leader .
The most charismatic of the Rose Revolution leaders who ousted veteran leader and former Soviet foreign minister Eduard Shevardnadze , the US - educated Saakashvili swept to the presidency in early 2004 on a wave of popular support .
His efforts to implement sweeping free - market reforms won high praise from the West , including Bush , who hailed Georgia as " a beacon of democracy " during a 2005 visit to Tbilisi .
The United States is now seeking to win backing for a strongly worded UN Security Council resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire .
The resolution would also demand a return to the status quo before Georgia sent forces into its breakaway South Ossetia enclave .
But with Moscow holding a power of veto in the Security Council there is little chance that it will pass a resolution strongly criticizing its own actions , and discussions have been deadlocked for days .
US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice has also been noticeably absent on the diplomatic scene , having failed to interrupt her holidays to fly to Tbilisi in support of the Georgian government .
Instead senior State Department official , Matthew Bryza , who oversees the Caucasus region was sent , two days later than planned , to join a joint EU - US mediation effort to win a ceasefire .
French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner , who is leading the mediation mission for the EU , said Monday the United States was " in a sense part of the conflict , " between Russia and Georgia .
" You talk about the Americans , of course they are in a sense part of the conflict , that is why we must emphasise the presence and the strength of the European Union , " Kouchner told French radio .
But State Department deputy spokesman Robert Wood sought Monday to dismiss the notion that the US was relatively powerless in face of the escalating conflict .
" We and the Europeans have leverage ...
The Russians know how seriously we take the situation , " he said .
" The US relations with Russia is of course a complicated one , but certainly Russia understands where we are on this conflict , where the European Union is on this conflict and we expect and hope that Russia will heed the call of the International community to stop the bombings , to agree to an immediate ceasefire and to have discussions with Georgia . "

Brownstein says , “ I was told it could only be personalized with names . ”
They would for instance , accept “ Craig and Doug for John McCain . "

There has been a lot of lively debate about the merits of suburb , country , city - much of it , I think , far too polarized .
For example the powerful impact of James Kunstler and the ( otherwise excellent ) film _ The End of Suburbia_ have effectively led a lot of people to simply dismiss the suburbs .
And yet many suburbs have approximately the same population density as 19th century large towns that supported considerable infrastructure .
Now in many cases , because of the ridiculous zoning laws , there is no such infrastructure , but large suburban houses and garages are appropriately sized to create it - interstitial businesses will spring up rapidly as people can no longer afford to shop , and zoning laws will be overthrown .
Let me be clear , I agree entirely with Kunstler that suburbia was a tremendous misallocation of resources - I think the project of the suburbs was deeply flawed .
Where I disagree is in the idea that we should now abandon them - that we must .
In fact , I think we must not , simply because industrial agriculture is increasingly disconnected from producing real food for real people .
As more and more Americans get poorer and are priced out of food by rising energy prices , we will absolutely require suburbia to keep fed - that arable land , much of it superb farmland - has to be brought back into production .
And since we wo n’t be commuting from the cities , we ’ll be living the houses .
Yes , it would absolutely have been better to build better houses and design better - but that does n’t make suburbia uninhabitable .
The same thing is true with cities - cities of 1 million or so have existed for a very , very long time .
I have my doubts about whether cities of 8 - 10 million will be sustainable in a world with high transport costs , but I also have no doubt that most cities , which were established for reasons - because they sit in a useful or valuable place - will continue to be cities , even if their infrastructure changes and their population reduces in the longer term .
Manhattan and Chicage and LA all do have a future - but it is important to be able to live within the kind of future they do have , and within the limitations of urban centers .
The countryside suffers most from transportation costs - it is reasonable to believe that deliveries may stop being made to rural areas .
It become plausible to think that such shortfalls might begin comparatively soon .
And for those who live in the countryside and have enjoyed the advantages of city jobs , suburban amenities , etc … this is likely to be a rough transition .
But that does n’t mean we will abandon the countryside - being able to eat creates tremendous incentives to keep some lines of connection open .
In short , I think it is most important to talk about how to live in the suburbs , or the city , or the country in a low energy future .
I think that may be more productive than extended screeds against one model or another .
The countryside , as we see in the above articles , is likely to suffer first and deepest from the shortage of fuels .
Now there are ( and I am overgeneralizing here ) two broad groups of people living in the country right now .
The first is made up of the rural poor and working class , farmers , homesteaders and country and those who want to be countr people - that is , people with ties either to land or other people in rural areas .
The other group are exurban commuters who may have hobby farms , keep horses ( not all people with hobby farms and horses fall into this category , obviously ) , or built McMansions out in the pretty countryside when gas was cheap , but who have no particular tie to the area , and strong ties to suburban style amenities .
They have either gotten these amenities by encouraging rural towns to use their growing tax base of exurban commuters to provide them , or by driving distances to where they are available .
Now the harrowing process of high fuel prices is likely to drive a lot of group # 2 , the exurban middle class , back towards population centers .
Some will stay and become part of group # 1 , or find some other way to do well in the rural areas , but most of them will probably pick up and move in the coming few years , dropping tax bases , leaving a lot of empty housing , and in otherwise emptying a large part of the rural landscape .
This change is likely to have two big effects .
The first is that the exurban middle class ( who often moved out as far as they did because they could n’t afford good housing nearer population centers ) will be competing with poorer urban residents for housing now - that is , they are likely to displace lower income people from cities and out into the countryside in a process of gentrification .
The second is that the tax and service base of rural areas is likely to simply collapse .
Many of these areas were pressed into making changes that wo n’t be sustainable - large multi- town district schools , for example , are simply going to be impossible to afford busing for .
On the other hand , group # 1 probably wo n’t move , and should n’t .
They are ( not universally , but often ) lower in income than the departing exurbanites , but they are also better adapted to their place .
The thing that makes it possible for most of the rural working class to get along where they do is that land prices are comparatively cheap - and they are going to become more so for at least a while .
In many ways this may be good - some of the buyers for the foreclosed McMansions are likely to be extended families , people who were already living together by necessity in trailers , and who now can live together in a four bedroom house .
Universally my rural neighbors are extremely handy , and if they ca n’t afford the foreclosure , would be happy to help build an addition onto their trailer from the scavenged pieces of the McMansions as well .
The un-gentrification of rural areas may actually have some benefits .
The same is true as absentee property owners of rural land sell or rent their holdings - some of these may be purchased , others simply reclaimed if left unused long enough .
The other thing that group number 1 often has are family ties - social connections that mean that Grandma takes care of the baby while doing their crappy low wage jobs , and then they take care of Grandma , rather than putting her in a home .
These ties are going to become increasingly valuable .
Yes , the cost of gas is going to be troublesome , but rising prices for food , firewood and fiber will partially offset this , and in general , these places have n’t even begun seriously economizing .
Yes , it is presently illegal to put 8 people in your pickup flatbed and drive to the Walmart for morning shift .
How much enforcement do we expect there to be as the rural police departments can barely afford gas ?
I ’m guessing not much .
Rural dwellers are suffering now because of high food prices and energy prices , but they have barely begun to use mitigation strategies - in most rural areas , the jobs are all in one or two locations , as are the supermarkets .
It will not be hard to put together large carpools and taxi services .
The problem is that as yet , no one has figured out that this is a permanent situation , so the adaptation process has not begun .
The same goes with growing food - yes , many rural dwellers do n’t grow gardens .
But they are often not very far removed from people who did , and they probably hunt , and they often are very resourceful .
Living in the formal economy , it is often very hard to do more than just get by - living in the informal economy can actually be much easier in rural areas , where there are natural resources to build upon ( or exploit - but hopefully that will be kept to a minimum ) .
My expectation is that many of those displaced from cities will probably be recent immigrants , many not very far removed from agricultural livelihoods as well .
There are likely to be some difficulties with this transition , and some hostility on both ends , but in the end , I suspect that many rural dwellers will find that they have a considerable amount in common with their new Mexican or Somali or Hmong neighbors .
I anticipate some trouble here - and some surprising alliances .
What will not be possible is for rural dwellers to live the way they do now - families will have to do subsistence work , most families will have to go back to one earner status ( because they can no longer afford transport costs ) , which should be possible as property values begin to fall .
The shift will be difficult and painful , and particularly hard on the elderly , but it will be possible in many cases .
That is not to say pleasant , or that many people wo n’t be ground up and spit out in the transition , but it is possible .
Living in rural areas will mean being comfortable with a degree of isolation previously unknown to those who went there - you wo n’t be taking the kids to soccer practice and swimming lessons .
You will * have * to get along with the neighbors - you are going to need to work together to get enough gas to afford to truck your produce into the city .
You will have to be very comfortable with fixing things yourself , making do and adapting to shortages .
Meeting your own needs becomes more important when every trip to the city is begrudged , and wo n’t be repeated for a month or more .
The nature of shopping changes - every expenditure of precious cash is begrudged ( in the county my great - great - grandfather lived in in Maine , there was the story that the only cash money in the whole county was a gold piece brought home by a neighbor man from his service in the Civil War ) , and barter and growing / hunting / foraging your own become more and more essential .
Because shopping changes , eating practices will have to change .
Do you drink a lot of milk , or eat a lot of meat ?
Well , I hope you plan to milk each morning and butcher your own - or have good relationships with someone who will , because you will not be buying fresh milk and meat regularly .
That ’s not to say that rural towns wo n’t have resources - for example , exurban McMansions will make great home business sites , and rural areas have been known to produce great local culture - many small rural towns had opera houses and theaters , recitation and music groups .
The Blues and Appalachian folk music , for example , grew up largely in rural areas where nearly everyone made music .
As the urban poor move outwards they will bring urban cultures into rural areas , and the cultures will blend and merge in creative ( and probably sometimes destructive ) ways .
Rural towns did once have thriving cultures - it is not at all impossible to imagine them having them again - or continuing to have them in many cases .
But they will be small cultures .
It will be necessary to derive one ’s pleasures from intense , deep knowledge of a narrow place , rather than broad shallow knowledge .
That is , we will have to find culture and diversity in new ways .
But while we can imagine having culture , we should assume virtually no * services * in rural areas - we will be on our own for protection , trash disposal , regulation of pollutants , etc …
What people do n’t band together to do wo n’t get done .
Access to markets will be intermittent - when you can afford the trip , rather than when you necessarily want to go .
It may also be strenuous - bicycling for long distances , for example .
Eventually new market lines will be built in many places - and some places may die out for lack of them .
But while a transition from the habit of being able to transport quickly may be hard to overcome and painful , it is worth remembering that rural life has existed for centuries .
Anyone who has ever seen a man walking for several days bringing his flock of sheep to market in a poor country , or a truck full of farmers heading down a mountain on market day , all crammed together , knows that it is perfectly possible to overcome scarcity of fuel - but setting up systems to do so is harder .
Ultimately , the ability to adapt and make do will be a fundamental requirement to rural living .
But that ’s true of urban dwellers as well .
Cities will certainly continue to be centers of trade , but the reality is that as prices for urban infrastructure rise , money , which becomes less available and less important for rural dwellers , becomes harder to come by and more essential for urbanites .
Perhaps the defining characteristic of succesful urban dwellers is the same one that defines rural dwellers - the ability to adapt .
But the adaptive abilities required are different - while rural dwellers may need subsistence skills , urban dwellers may need the ability to recognize commercial opportunities and fill them , to rapidly shift from one business to another - first importing goods , then auctioning repossessed items , then being the middleman with local farmers .
The informal economy is likely to be just as important for urban dwellers as for rural ones , but instead of the subsistence economy subsidizing job loss , scavenging , meeting newly opened needs and taking advantage of short - notice opportunities , and black market activities are likely to be among the biggest sources of jobs in cities .
Economic flexibility will probably be key .
While urban centers are likely to be the last places where actual shortages will hit , the high cost of urban living - even urban slum living - is likely to effectively cut many people out of marketplaces .
And there is far less space for further consolidation in urban housing - there is some , and consolidation there will be , both because urban owners will only be able to keep their condos and homes by bringing in other people , and also because density is profitable .
Living well in cities will probably involve the ability to live in quite small spaces , and to tolerate infrastructure breakdowns with reasonable good cheer .
They wo n’t happen as often as they do in the countryside , but when the sewer lines break or the gas goes off or the electricity goes out , the consequences are likely to be considerably more acute .
While country dwellers may find that many services simply disappear - there is no one to plow the road , there are no police anymore , intermittency is likely to be a characteristic of urban life .
The ability to work with others and self regulate well is also likely to be absolutely essential - urban population densities mean the threat that fairly commonsense responses to breakdown could lead to disaster - for example , if the water stops flowing , it only makes sense to begin bringing human manures out of the buildings - but * everyone * must do this in a way that avoids water contamination and that handles the wastes wisely , or disease spreads and the city stinks .
If the gas goes out , the temptation to use a small burner to cook becomes almost intolerable - but the need to regulate these and train people in safety is acute , since a single fire can take out a whole apartment building - or neighborhood .
One of the questions worth asking is whether you will like urban life as it is lived by the poor - because that is probably the reality for most of us , no matter where we live .
For those who are comfortably living in cities , this may be a very rude awakening .
And for those whose experience of urban poverty is primarily of the graduate student or actor / waitress kind , a similar , if not quite as acute shock awaits .
Job losses are rising in the financial centers , in tourism and tourism tied industries , and will rise further .
Without the ability to borrow money to go to college , professors will be laid off .
Those who are n’t comfortably well off themselves in cities , but rely on the disposable income of the middle and upper middle class may also find themselves suffering as that class becomes less wealthy .
If you presently enjoy all the benefits of urban life with extended trips into the countryside to reconnect with nature , ask yourself how you will like doing without these - in August , during a heat wave .
If you have depended on air conditioning to keep cool , and heat to keep warm , think about what happens when the infrastructure fails , or when you simply can’t pay the bills .
If you love your job , ask whether you will love the work you are going to be able to get .
In fact , I generally speaking would say that if you would be reasonably comfortable living in the poorest and worst neighborhood in your city now , you ’ll be fine in the city .
Many urban poor already experience most of the dangers of post peak life - health complications because of urban life , insufficient security , insufficient access to food , energy shutoffs , indifferent response from the wealthy .
The two worries most articulated about urban life are security and food .
Both of these are real worries - but they apply to everyone else on the paradigm to .
Rural areas that do n’t produce all they eat risk not getting imports because it is n’t worth bringing in supplies to the outer margins of the supply lines .
Rural areas that have poor alliances between neighbors are likely to experience rising crime rates , as poverty provides greater incentives for crime and violence .
There is generally more crime in urban areas , but there are also more people - alliances are remarkably powerful in this regard .
Again , urban dwellers may be broadly divided into two groups - the kind who politely try not to know their neighbors and who never make eye contact , and those who have strong community ties .
Many urban dwellers in poor neighborhoods have been dealing with precisely the same things we are facing for decades - inadequate security , poor police presence or reason to fear the police themselves , high crime rates - and often community groups are able , working together , to minimize these problems .
The successful will be those who are prepared to work together in deep ways , and to prioritize the welfare of the community overall .
As for food , it is far more likely that you will go hungry because you ca n’t afford to buy food than because there is none in the stores .
Shortages are a possibility , but again , cities are cities for a reason - they are often at the hub of rail , water , or other lines .
Some cities , particularly those with acute water shortages , simply may end up with a comparatively small population by necessity .
But for the rest , the food will come in , usually .
The question is , will you be able to buy it .
My own feeling is that cities will have to produce a large portion of their produce and probably meat - the end of refrigerated shipping is coming , and probably quite quickly for any but the rich .
While grains will probably be shipped out by train , things that have to be kept cold , that now come from irrigated farmlands far away , are probably going to go out of the reach of many people .
Fortunately , this is possible - even Hong Kong , for example , produces a large portion of its meat and vegetables within the city limits .
For the dryest cities - LA , Las Vegas , Pheonix - Tucson , this may not be possible , and that may be their undoing - they wo n’t go away , but the populations of these cities may contract dramatically .
Not coincidentally , these are also tremendously hot places , and without air conditioning , urban dwellings may be nearly intolerable .
But it is completely possible to imagine even Manhattan or San Francisco or Chicago or Toronto producing quite a lot of its own meat and produce , and certainly Cleveland and Atlanta and Ottawa will be able to do so .
It will be done in vacant lots , on rooftops , on stoops and balconies in containers , in tiny backyards and by the reclamation of public space - food will have to go wherever there is room , and that includes livestock .
Anyone who plans to stay in a city really must take some responsibility for their own food systems , IMHO , not in a light way , but in a commitment to produce as much as possible within city limits .
The great difficulty for cold climate cities will be heat - if utilities become intermittent or too expensive , it will be very cold , and there are fewer options for heating in densely populated areas .
But cold wo n’t generally kill you - it will be merely unpleasant , and the heat island effect and the sheer proximity of neighbors will probably keep most people alive as they wait for spring , in worst case scenarios .
And thus we are back to this question of what kind of person you are - there are those entrepreneurial spirits who will take any job , do any work , and can turn anything into gold , and may always be able to buy food .
And there are those that simply can’t .
It is worth knowing thyself .
Again , the merits of strong family and community ties come up - a great deal can be accomplished by self - help groups working together .
Food supplies can be bought collectively , slum conditions overcome , community gardens reclaimed from the city , security provided , soup kitchens opened .
But one must work together , and be prepared to adapt .
In fact , where to live may depend on how you want to work with people .
Both urban and rural life will require community ties - in rural places , because without those ties , things simply wo n’t happen .
In urban ones , to restrain one ’s self - interest for the greater good .
My own observation is that most people tend to prefer one kind of these regulations to another - they chafe , for example , at the idea that one could restrict their right to do as they want on their property , no matter how stupid or dangerous , or they chafe at the idea that others might be doing things they consider unwise in the privacy of their own homes , and they are not there to observe and stop them .
It is useful , I think , to decide which sort of person you are , and thus , where you will be happy - out in the country where you can get drunk and shoot deer through the unopened windows of your trailer or in the city where you can get drunk and lecture a passerby on the evils of public urination ;-) .
Then again , many of us prefer a middle ground - and suburbia , of course , is supposed to be precisely that .
Whether the ‘ burbs are the best of both worlds or the worst depends on your perspective and probably on the kind of suburb you are living in .
Many suburbs near where I live actually have long histories as towns with meaningful economies , and now simply have more housing in them .
It is not at all improbable to imagine much , say , of suburban Boston reconstituting itself as towns , changing its restrictive zoning to allow the transformation of garages into shops and spare bedrooms into rental housing .
The great advantage of suburbia is that it is often both reasonably proximate to some kind of employment and possible to produce a substantial part of one ’s needs on the land attached to it .
Most suburban lots wo n’t enable any kind of self - sufficiency , but most suburbanites could meet a surprising portion of their needs .
Not enough to obviate the need for supplemental income - while rural dwellers may have little or no cash to pay the property taxes , and urban dwellers cash but not enough to buy food , suburbanites will struggle on both ends - their houses cost a great deal initially , and they wo n’t generally have large enough surpluses for sale .
Successful suburban dwelling may require more flexibility than either urban or rural life , because it will require the maintence of an income in most cases , while also requiring that costs be absolutely minimized so that people can keep their houses .
On the other hand , this may actually be possible .
If people are willing to consolidate housing , and bring extended families ( biological or chosen ) together , keeping the roof over one ’s head should be manageable .
Meanwhile , there probably will be some empty lots across the road , and a few foreclosed buildings to take down and scavenge .
We have essentially been filling suburbia with a large chunk of our wealth - it is no longer worth what we thought it was , of course , but that does n’t mean that boards and reclaimed insulation , copper piping and shingles have no value .
That wealth will probably keep a surprisingly large number of people going , while they also grow gardens and commute , crammed together , into population centers .
The transition from nuclear family to extended is unlikely to be easy - and less easy on middle class suburbanites than on the poor in both rural and urban areas , who already require social ties to keep lives going .
The distances between suburban families will also be a problem as people begin to negotiate - which set of parents do you live near or with ?
Who moves ?
Whose house goes on the block and who keeps theirs .
In many cases , this will be shaped by sequence of events , rather than intent , but I suspect it will go better if intent is involved , if the conversations required for this begin sooner , rather than later .
The anomie of suburbia is legendary , and probably wildly overstated .
Some neighborhoods are better at ties than other .
But what is true is that these ties are generally recreational , rather than practical .
That is , neighborhoods are having barbecues and commercial parties ( cooking equipment , sex toys and lingerie being the most popular , an alliance I ’ve always admired ) , playdates and PTA meetings , not organizing for survival .
That is true elsewhere , but suburbia has tended to have fewer self - help groups ( by which I mean not emotional self - help but practical ) than cities or the country .
That will have to change for suburbia to be successful .
And this , I think , may be the root shift that has to occur in suburbia - what must finally change is the perception of what constitutes “ a good life . ”
The suburbs were the good life for millions of Americans and Canadians - and what may ultimately hurt us most is what Kunstler calls “ the psychology of previous investment ” - our inability to let go of what we expect a particular life to be .
I think that Kunstler and others are right that this is particularly acute for suburban dwellers , who have had in their midst many fewer people showing alternate visions .
Zoning regulations , for example , will have to be rapidly overturned to allow people to survive in many suburbs - and that is likely to be contentious , simply because disaster never hits everyone equally .
But the psychology of previous investment has another side - it may prevent us from abandoning the suburbs , but the sheer psychological weight of our investmen in the suburbs may ultimately enable us to make that shift - that is , people are attached to their place , to the idea of their place , and it may be possible for them to make that space mean something else , in order to keep it .
The question of whether the suburbs are the best or worst of both worlds will depend , finally , on whether our attachement to our previous investment is to the place , or the idea of suburbia .
If it is to the place , to the actual land and soil beneath our feet and if we can become attached to our houses , stop moving so much and settle in a place , it is possible that suburbia could thrive in many regions .
If it turns out that what we wanted was a dream of Eden , only without the snakes , suburbia will fall apart .
Suburbia is so tied up with children and family life that I feel like I should say something about that .
The suburban model of childhood will simply have to come to an end .
Many more children will probably be homeschooled , many more children will probably be put to work sooner helping out at home , and the child - centered model will probably disintegrate , replaced by a family - centered model in which children are expected to pitch in , listen and are not treated always like visiting heads of state to be deferred to and offered the best .
For those who moved to the suburbs for their children , the loss of the way of life and the hopes of giving them the best they can will be painful - and it may be here we are most unable to adapt .
This will apply to some rural and urban dwellers , particularly the wealthy ones now made poorer , but it will be most acute in suburbia .
Some people may actually leave , seeking the pleasures of urban or rural life now that the suburbs ca n’t offer them a fantasy - perfect childhood picture .
For others , a new vision of family life may grow up .
Suburbanites will always be more at risk in the general economy than those who are closer to economic centers , and they will always be more at risk in terms of food security than those who can meet their entire dietary needs , but most suburbs offer enormous potential to allow people to live with one foot in the formal economy and another in the informal economy ( or both feet in the informal , but in different branches thereof ) .
Dmitry Orlov observes that most post - collapse soviet gardens were very small - smaller than the average suburban lot .
Now grains kept coming in - but except for the very outermost suburbs , the lines between city and suburb are fairly strong .
Even if public transport does n’t exist .
there are enough people , a large enough market to justify moving food and fuel and goods out to many suburs .
Houses are large enough for suburban dwellers to stockpile , just as rural ones do - both the produce of their gardens and food bought on infrequent trips to supply centers by shared vehicle .
Suburban dwellers will probably need a wider balance of skills than either their city or country counterparts - they will simultaneously need the skills to minimize dependence on the public economy and the ability to function well there .
They will need to be able to grow their own , fix their own and make do , and also to run businesses or find work when old sources dry up .
And like everyone else they will require strong community ties to keep back the forces of collapse , and to create a local economy and culture worth having .
Moreover , while rural dwellers may struggle to get their pigs or their fruit to market in an era of reduced transportation , suburbanites who can produce moderate surpluses will have hungry and relatively proximate markets for what they own .
I recall someone telling me about their cousins who became “ dill millionaires ” growing dill on an 1/8 acre suburban lot outside of Moscow , simply bringing their herbs into the city .
For those in the areas around cities , the old system , where suburbanites shuttled in to work in city businesses may continue - and those going to work there may be bringing in their eggs and apples to sell to coworkers .
Or the jobs themselves may disappear , and the eggs and apples become the point of the trip .
In this sense , the more proximate suburbs , despite ( often ) greater density , may have an advantage .
In short , I do n’t think it is easy to generalize about where the best place to live is .
In all cases , flexibility , adaptability , self - sufficiency and practicality will matter a lot .
And in each case , it is n’t that any choice is inherently bad , it is that it depends on what we are prepared for , what skills we want to emphasize , what balance we hope to find .
It is easier , of course , to generalize about one choice or another , but ultimately , IMHO , less productive .

I was playing around with DOM Document Fragments recently , in JavaScript , seeing what I could make with them .
Roughly speaking , a DocumentFragment is a lightweight container that can hold DOM nodes .
It ’s part of the DOM 1 specification and is supported in all modern browsers ( it was added to Internet Explorer in version 6 ) .
In reading up on them I came across an interesting point , from the specification :
Furthermore , various operations — such as inserting nodes as children of another Node — may take Document Fragment objects as arguments ; this results in all the child nodes of the Document Fragment being moved to the child list of this node .
This means that if you take a bunch of DOM nodes and append them to a fragment then you can simply append the fragment to the document , instead ( and achieve the same result – as if you had appended each node individually ) .
I instantly smelled a possible performance improvement here .
I investigated a little bit further and noticed that DocumentFragments support the cloneNode method , as well .
This provides all the functionality that you need to highly - optimize your DOM insertion code .
I set up a simple demo to test the theory .
Let ’s take the situation where you have a bunch of DOM nodes that you need to append into the document ( in the demo it ’s 12 nodes – 8 at the top level – against a whole mess of divs ) .
var elems = [ document.createElement ( " hr " ) , text ( document.createElement ( " b " ) , " Links : " ) , document.createTextNode ( " " ) , text ( document.createElement ( " a " ) , " Link A " ) , document.createTextNode ( " | " ) , text ( document.createElement ( " a " ) , " Link B " ) , document.createTextNode ( " | " ) , text ( document.createElement ( " a " ) , " Link C " ) ] ; function text ( node , txt ) { node.appendChild ( document.createTextNode( txt ) ) ; return node ; }
Normal Append
If we wanted to append these nodes into the document we would probably do it in this traditional manner : Looping through the nodes and cloning them individually ( so that we can continue to append them all throughout the document ) .
var div = document.getElementsByTagName( “ div ” ) ;
for ( var i = 0 ; i < div.length ; i++ ) { for ( var e = 0 ; e < elems.length ; e++ ) { div[ i].appendChild ( elems[e].cloneNode( true ) ) ; } }[/js ] DocumentFragment Append
However , when we bring Document Fragments into the picture we can immediately see a different structure .
To start we append all our nodes into the fragment itself ( built using the createDocument Fragment method ) .
But the interesting point comes when it ’s time to actually insert the nodes into the document :
We only have to call appendChild and cloneNode once for all the nodes !
var div = document.getElementsByTagName( “ div ” ) ;
var fragment = document.createDocumentFragment ( ) ;
for ( var e = 0 ; e < elems.length ; e++ ) { fragment.appendChild( elems[e ] ) ; } for ( var i = 0 ; i < div.length ; i++ ) { div[ i].appendChild ( fragment.cloneNode( true ) ) ; }[/js ]
Setting some time stamps we can see our results pay off in spades :
Browser Normal ( ms ) Fragment ( ms ) Firefox 3.0.1 90 47 Safari 3.1.2 156 44 Opera 9.51 208 95 IE 6 401 140 IE 7 230 61 IE 8b1 120 40
As it turns out : A method that is largely ignored in modern web development can provide some serious ( 2 - 3 x ) performance improvements to your DOM manipulation .
Texas tests 10,407 students for steroids – but only 2 flunk Preliminary results find very little student steroid use
Findings prove deterrent effect , supporters say ; but critics argue screenings prove $ 3 million - a- year project is a waste of money
AUSTIN — Only two athletes tested positive for steroid use among some 10,000 Texas high school students tested this spring , raising doubts about whether state lawmakers will renew the $ 3 million - a- year project at current levels .
The testing company 's preliminary results are based on an estimated 10,407 students who were tested since February , when state officials launched the random steroid - testing program mandated by state lawmakers .
National Center for Drug Free Sport is expected to release a formal report later this summer .
Both supporters and critics of the testing program — the largest among high schools in the country — said the results validate their positions .
Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst said Monday he was pleased with the cursory results .
" I pushed this important legislation through the Legislature because I knew it would deter our young people from wrecking their bodies and putting their lives at risk by using illegal steroids , " Dewhurst said .
" And these test results clearly show the deterrent is working because young people know they can't use illegal steroids without getting caught . "
But Sen. Dan Patrick , R- Houston , one of seven state lawmakers to vote against the steroid - testing program , wants it abolished .
There are 181 members in the Texas Legislature .
" This is one of those issues that sounds good but has no real impact except wasting taxpayer dollars , " Patrick said .
" I do n't want to diminish the seriousness of steroids , but you can't take a sledgehammer to kill a gnat .
Spending $ 1.5 million per kid is ludicrous . "
The program missed the football season , although the random tests did include football players in the off - season .
Patrick doubted that testing during the football season this fall would produce significant changes .
The purpose of the program has met its objective of creating a deterrent effect and ensuring fair competition , said Rep. Dan Flynn , R - Van , House sponsor for the steroid legislation .
Flynn did not flinch at the $ 1.5 million cost per positive test result , noting the price tag would be immaterial " if that 's your kid . "
Brett Marshall , a recently graduated Baytown Sterling pitcher and the New York Yankees ' sixth - round draft pick in June 's Major League Baseball draft , said he was n't surprised by the low number of positive tests .
" With everything that 's going on in the majors , I 'm sure if high school kids were taking steroids they stopped ( by time testing began ) , " he said .
" If they would have done it a couple of years ago , I think more would have failed .
But players are more aware because of what has gone on at the major league level . "
Protecting students
Several coaches also questioned the cost of the steroid - testing program , but noted it did serve the purpose of being a deterrent .
" I think in this day and time , anything we can do to protect our kids is good , " said Corby Meekins , Westfield head football coach .
He said it was probably too early to decide whether the testing should be stopped .
" If we 're able to save five , that 's five we would n't have gotten to if we were n't testing , " Meekins said .
The program will resume in the fall , with an estimated 30 percent of student athletes at 400 Texas public high schools to be randomly tested .
Between 40,000 and 50,000 student athletes will be tested next school year , according to state officials .
The results of the second year of testing likely will determine future funding , Flynn said .
" If we come back and you have just another two positive tests , then I think it would be realistic to scale it back some , " he said .
" I do n't think anyone would have a problem with that because you still have the deterrent factor out there because it's a random test . "
The first positive test for anabolic steroid use triggers a 30 - day suspension from competition .
State officials would not identify the schools in which a student - athlete failed the steroid test .
Education 's role
Experts predicted that random steroid tests would result in less than 1 percent of students testing positive , said Jeff Kloster , associate commissioner for health and safety at the Texas Education Agency
" Whether or not the program continues as a state - funded program is a policy decision that the Legislature will have to look at based upon what they know , " Kloster said .
His agency will continue to provide anti-steroid educational information to students , parents and coaches , he said .
State Rep. Debbie Riddle , R - Tomball , agreed that schools should ramp up educational warnings about steroid use .
But she voted against the testing program last year and hopes it fizzles out in the next legislative session .
" I thought the whole concept was absolutely silly , " she said .
" We should focus on education ...
The money needs to be better utilized in preparing our kids for Texas ' global economy . "

One of the lesser known cornerstones of modern physics is Claude Shannon ’s mathematical theory of communication which he published in 1948 while juggling and unicycling his way around Bell Labs .
Shannon ’s theory concerns how a message created at one point in space can be reproduced at another point in space .
He calls the conduit for such a process a channel and the limits imposed by the universe on this process the channel capacity .
The capacity of a communications channel is hugely important idea .
It tells you , among other things , the rate at which you can send information from one location to another , without loss .
If you ’ve ever made a phone call , watched television or surfed the internet you ’ll have benefited from the work associated with this idea .
In recent years , our ideas about communication have been transformed by the possibility of using quantum particles to carry information .
When that happens the strange rules of quantum mechanics govern what can and cannot be sent from one region of space to another .
This kind of thinking has has spawned the entirely new fields of quantum communication and quantum computing .
But ask a physicist what the capacity is of a quantum information channel and she ’ll stare at the floor and shuffle her feet .
Despite years of trying , nobody has been able to update Shannon ’s theory of communication with a quantum version .
Which is why a paper today on the arXiv is so exciting .
Graeme Smith at the IBM Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights NY ( a lab that has carried the torch for this problem ) and Jon Yard from Los Alamos National Labs have made what looks to be an important breakthrough by calculating that two zero - capacity quantum channels can have a nonzero capacity when used together .
That ’s interesting because it indicates that physicists may have been barking up the wrong tree with this problem : perhaps the quantum capacity of a channel does not uniquely specify its ability for transmitting quantum information .
And if not , what else is relevant ?
That ’s going to be a stepping stone to some interesting new thinking in the coming months and years .
Betcha !

This gives you the chance to enjoy all the space you need and to stay with your family , but still have them close enough to be safe and sound .
Republican presidential candidate John McCain said he was n't sure how many houses he and his wife own .
Here is a rundown of the wealth of the Arizona Republican and his wife , Cindy .
Most assets are in his wife 's name .
BEER EARNINGS
Cindy McCain is heiress to her father 's stake - and serves as chairwoman - of a family - owned Anheuser - Busch distributor in Phoenix , Hensley & Co. Beverage industry analysts estimate Hensley 's value at more than $ 250 million and its annual sales at $ 300 million or more .
OTHER ASSETS
Cindy and her children own a minority stake in the Arizona Diamondbacks .
The professional baseball team 's chief executive , Jeff Moorad , and former majority owner Jerry Colangelo are McCain fundraisers .
Assets held by Cindy McCain alone or with her children also include Anheuser - Busch stock ; two condominiums along the California coast worth a total of at least $ 3 million and Arizona investments in rental medical offices and a parking lot , according to property records and John McCain 's latest financial disclosure reports .
PERKS
Cindy McCain 's beer earnings afforded the senator the use of a private jet and vacation homes .
FINANCIAL REPORTING
Sen . McCain reports little more wealth than when he started in politics .
With his book royalties and radio- appearance fees donated to charity , McCain 's Senate salary of $ 169,300 and Navy pension of about $ 56,000 are his only significant sources of income .
AVOIDING CONFLICTS
McCain has long said he refrains from voting on beer industry - specific issues .
Honesty is the first chapter of the book of wisdom .
— Thomas Jefferson
Deception is cancerous .
The first mutation of a truth charts a path to colonize its host .
One fib demands another , two lies need the proof of two more , until eventually even the most innocent half - truth metastasizes into a falsehood requiring surgery .
A lie is a deliberate attempt to fake the nature of reality .
So a scientist who reaches a flawed conclusion through an error in her experimentation method may hint at incompetence , but she is not lying .
But a guy who trades his own happiness for a fat paycheque and calls himself “ successful ” , must be charged with first - degree bullshit .
His deception may succeed temporarily but he has not altered the facts , and the moral transaction is still charged to his account .
Why is faking the nature of reality bad ?
Because reality exists .
No matter how hard you try to treat things differently than they really are , they still are .
A job that drains your will to live is a job that drains your will to live .
A girl who does n’t respect you , does n’t respect you .
When the disconnect with reality comes from a genuine error , the mistake is open to correction .
The evidence of a fallacy shows up in the form of contradiction , and logic and reason can help stitch things back together .
But intentional deceit makes the perpetrator a fugitive ; sometimes physically , always intellectually .
For whenever a liar ’s evidence contradicts itself , he must flee further and further from the facts to maintain his sliding grip on sincerity .
The safe haven from the perils of denying what is , is radical honesty .
To commit to radical honesty is to take an oath sworn directly on the face of existence .
It ’s a pledge — in your work , in your relationships , and to yourself — to see things exactly as they are , to the best of your ability .
It acknowledges that almost all things are small things and that nothing is bigger than the truth .
Radical Honesty at Work
Few relationships will last longer , or have a larger effect on your day - to - day life , than the relationship between you and the value - producing activity that is your work .
Applying radical honesty in your work means creating things that are of value to you personally .
Can each of us really do work that is of value to us personally ?
On what planet would we ever find someone to specialize in the manufacture of , say , toilet paper ?
Someone who would claim that such work is of value to him personally ?
You ’d find that guy on the planet where ass - wiping technology does n’t yet exist , where there ’s a guy who ’s sick of using his bare hands for the task , and where he is the only man alive annoyed enough to scratch this particular itch himself .
The things that are of value to you personally are entirely dependent on your environment and how you relate to it .
For example , I could n’t care less about growing my own food .
There are lots of lots of people — “ farmers ” as they ’re called — who already do this .
And they ’re willing , with the aid of an elaborate supply chain , to take my money in exchange for their food .
If I did n’t have access to anyone who was willing to grow food , maintain livestock , and sell me either when I needed them , then I ’d pretty quickly become interested in this problem .
I value my own life and I need food to live .
What most frustrates you about the world ?
Almost every answer to that question is a business idea with your name written all over it .
And when the work you do pays the bills both financially and spiritually , you have truly become your own boss .
Radical Honesty in Relationships
There ’s a strong tie between your work and your relationships .
Asking “ What most frustrates you about the world ? ” is not only a means of identifying opportunities to create value in your life , it ’s also a compass that directs you towards the people that will help make those dreams come true .
Radical honesty in relationships — whether platonic or intimate — requires self - respect .
Self - respect is a seed planted by the standards you set :
How do you treat people ?
How do you let them treat you ?
Purpose is also paramount .
In geek terms , your mission is like an Uninterruptible Power Supply , a primary source of energy and the motive power behind all the moving parts of your life .
The relationships worth having are those with a voltage high enough to match your own , not those that cause a power failure .
Maintaining integrity in relationships means addressing problems that come up in real - time .
Emotions are not chess pieces , and love is not a game of strategy .
If you sense that something might be wrong , seek to identify and resolve the issue on the spot .
If you ’re constantly met with responses like the Solemn Downward Stare , followed by the Evening of Awkward Silence , and the Night Without Sex , then be warned : the game you ’re playing is n’t worth winning .
Radical Self - Honesty
The hardest person to be honest with is yourself .
Really , the only person you can be honest with is you .
All delusion is ultimately self - delusion .
Radical self - honesty requires a matching dose of humility .
Whatever score you give yourself in any category is almost surely inflated .
If the currency by which we measure others is pounds , the currency by which we measure ourselves is yen .
Some of these feelings of superior knowledge , skill , or judgement are no doubt justified .
But many , if not most of them , are n’t .
The moment you become conscious of this , your self - awareness expands .
You begin to ask yourself more honest questions and give yourself more honest answers .
I find journalling to be an effective way to keep myself honest .
I reach for my journal whenever I feel there ’s an idea or milestone — good or bad — worth documenting .
For example , I ’ve got an overwhelming appetite for change .
So when several months ago I started getting bored with my day - to - day routine , I made a journal entry about it .
I even made a list of specific adjustments I wanted to make to shake things up .
Looking at that list now , I ’ve installed about 60 % of those tweaks so far with more currently in progress .
How Honest Is Too Honest ?
In the honesty business , there ’s a fine line between radical and reckless .
Reckless honesty is the result of pushing the authenticity envelope so far that you shoot yourself in the foot .
Radical honesty is having the balls to walk up to a girl and say “ Hi ” because you think she ’s attractive and you want to find out more .
Reckless honesty is walking up to the same girl and saying “ Wow , you are absolutely gorgeous .
There ’s nothing I ’d like to do more right now than to take you into the nearest bathroom , rip all your clothes off , and fuck you to God . ”
Both approaches are , technically speaking , completely authentic .
But one is obviously somewhat more productive .
The border between radical and reckless must be patrolled by your intuition .
Sometimes that line is obvious ( like in the example above ) , but sometimes it ’s not .
As a general rule , accuracy is more important than precision .
If you have a habit of stopping short of saying what you really think , turning things around will take time .
But there is no challenge more worth tackling .
Authenticity accrues a compound interest , and even a few extra cents of veracity today could become a large down payment on your happiness tomorrow .

House pulls novel on Islam , fears violence Reuters
Published : Friday August 8 , 2008
Print This Email This By Edith Honan NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Publisher Random House has pulled a novel about the Prophet Mohammed 's child bride , fearing it could " incite acts of violence . "
" The Jewel of Medina , " a debut novel by journalist Sherry Jones , 46 , was due to be published on August 12 by Random House , a unit of Bertelsmann AG , and an eight - city publicity tour had been scheduled , Jones told Reuters on Thursday .
The novel traces the life of A'isha from her engagement to Mohammed , when she was six , until the prophet 's death .
Jones said that she was shocked to learn in May , that publication would be postponed indefinitely .
" I have deliberately and consciously written respectfully about Islam and Mohammed ... I envisioned that my book would be a bridge - builder , " said Jones .
Random
House deputy publisher Thomas Perry said in a statement the company received " cautionary advice not only that the publication of this book might be offensive to some in the Muslim community , but also that it could incite acts of violence by a small , radical segment . "
" In this instance we decided , after much deliberation , to postpone publication for the safety of the author , employees of Random House , booksellers and anyone else who would be involved in distribution and sale of the novel , " Perry said .
Jones , who has just completed a sequel to the novel examining her heroine 's later life , is free to sell her book to other publishers , Perry said .
The decision has sparked controversy on Internet blogs and in academic circles .
Some compared the controversy to previous cases where portrayals of Islam were met with violence .
Protests and riots erupted in many Muslim countries in 2006 when cartoons , one showing the Prophet Mohammed wearing a turban resembling a bomb , appeared in a Danish newspaper .
At least 50 people were killed and Danish embassies attacked .
British author Salman Rushdie 's 1988 book " The Satanic Verses " was met with riots across the Muslim world .
Rushdie was forced into hiding for several years after Iran 's then supreme religious leader , Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini , proclaimed a death edict , or fatwa , against him .
Jones , who has never visited the Middle East , spent several years studying Arab history and said the novel was a synthesis of all she had learned .
" They did have a great love story , " Jones said of Mohammed and A'isha , who is often referred to as Mohammed 's favorite wife .
" He died with his head on her breast . " ( Editing by Alan Elsner )

I have great news for MySQL users .
A very nice side effect has emerged from the development of the NeverBlock support for MySQL .
I am glad to announce the release of a new MySQL driver for Ruby applications .
It builds on top of the original Ruby MySQL driver but it comes with two notable additions : Thanks to help from Roger Pack and Aman Gupta we were able to put the thing together that you can use and test right now ( on Ruby1.8 and 1.9 ) To install it please do :
Then you can use it in your code as follows :
The test folder of the gem contains examples for threaded and evented implementations .
The announcement page in NeverBlock shows benchmark results for running the sleeping queries in normal ( blocking ) , evented and threaded modes .
The normal mode is 10X slower , which is normal due to its inability to run queries in parallel .
Now that Rails is becoming so - so - thread - safe this should show tremendous gains with Rails deployments that use MySQL ( PostgreSQL already has such facilities ) .

" We had a dream .
Now it 's a reality . "
For many , Sen. Barack Obama is an agent of change , but some critics say he could make race relations worse .
That 's the slogan on a popular T - shirt linking Sen.
Barack Obama 's presidential run to the Rev. Martin Luther King 's dream of racial equality .
It 's one of several T - shirts -- including " Barack is my homeboy " -- that reflect African - Americans ' euphoria over Obama 's White House bid .
But there are others who warn that an Obama presidency could hurt African - Americans .
They say an Obama victory could cause white Americans to ignore entrenched racial divisions while claiming that America has reached the racial Promised Land .
Paul Street , author of the forthcoming book " Barack Obama and the Future of American Politics , " says Obama risks becoming an Oval Office version of talk - show host Oprah Winfrey .
She and former Secretary of State Colin Powell are African - American figures whose popularity allows some white Americans to congratulate themselves for not being racist , he says
" They 're cited as proof that racism is no longer a significant barrier to black advancement and interracial equality , " Street said .
" This is n't new .
Go to the 19th century , and Southern aristocrats would point to a certain African - American landowner who was doing well to prove that whites are not racist . "
Nick Shapiro , an Obama spokesman , says Obama believes that America has made tremendous progress in the past 50 years .
iReport.com : Biggest challenges for black America
" However , the suggestion that somehow Senator Obama 's campaign represents an easy shortcut is not realistic , " Shapiro said in a statement .
" Senator Obama believes that we still have a lot of work to do , and that 's not just true for the issues facing blacks or Latinos , but for women and other communities struggling to secure the basic necessities in life like jobs , housing , health care and quality education . "
Are we a post - racial society ?
Any suggestion that an Obama presidential victory could set back race relations may seem odd or even inappropriate .
His presidential campaign has been framed by many observers as a glowing example of America 's move to a " post- racial " society .

" Racial polarization used to be a dominating force in our politics , but we 're now a different , and better , country , " Paul Krugman , a New York Times columnist , wrote last month about Obama 's political rise .
The reaction in the African - American community to Obama 's success has also been celebrated with joy .
When Obama became the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee in June , many African - Americans cried because they said they never thought they would live to see such a day .
Vendors soon started selling T - shirts of Obama 's portrait pasted alongside King in Walgreens stores and at online stores .
Yet there are a few political commentators who warn African - Americans that an Obama victory could be twisted to suppress the push for racial equality .
Most of these commentators are African - American , but they also include white , Latino and conservative pundits .
These commentators say that there is a subliminal appeal to Obama 's presidential candidacy that has been ignored .
Obama does n't just represent change ; he represents atonement for America 's ugly racial past for others , they say .
Steve Sailer , a columnist for The American Conservative magazine , wrote last year that some whites who support Obama are n't driven primarily by a desire for change .
They want something else Obama offers them : " White Guilt Repellent , " he wrote .
" So many whites want to be able to say , ' I 'm not one of them , those bad whites .
...
Hey , I voted for a black guy for president , ' " Sailer wrote .
Sailer cited another reason why many whites want Obama as president :
" They hope that when a black finally moves into the White House , it will prove to African - Americans , once and for all , that white animus is n't the cause of their troubles .
All blacks have to do is to act like President Obama - and their problems will be over . "
Glen Ford , executive editor of the online journal blackagendareport.com , offered some white Americans a free solution to the race problem : " Millions of whites came to believe Obama could solve the ' race problem ' by his mere presence , at no cost to their own notions of skin privilege , " Ford wrote in an essay in January .
Other African - American commentators say the " post- racial " tag attached to Obama could be used to dismiss legitimate black grievances .
Andra Gillespie , an assistant professor at Emory University 's political science department , says Obama 's success does n't mean America has become a post- racial society .
She says it may signal the decline of individual racism but not another form of discrimination : systemic racism .
" It does n't mean that there are n't prejudiced people anymore , " she said .
Systemic racism is a form of racism that 's entrenched in institutions .
Some argue that it's the primary cause for intractable problems in the African - American community that range from substandard public schools to disproportionate rates of imprisonment , she says .
Electing a black president does not mean that America is ready to take on systemic racism , Gillespie says .
" A rising tide does n't lift all boats , " Gillespie said .
" Just because [ Obama ] gets elected does n't mean the lives of poor black people are automatically going to improve . "
It could actually get worse for poor African - Americans , she says .
" People could say if Barack [ Obama ] can succeed and someone can't get off of the stoops in the hood , it 's their fault , and it has nothing to do with systemic racism , " Gillespie said .
D. Yobachi Boswell , a blogger for Black Perspective.net , wrote in January that the prospect of an Obama victory was making African - Americans politically passive .
He wrote that too many African - Americans were " doping ourselves up on the euphoric opium " of a black president while forgetting that " we need fundamental change , not just Negroes in high places . "
Boswell says he 's concerned that an Obama presidency would discourage African - Americans from keeping leaders accountable .
" We can't give [ Obama ] a pass because he 's black , " Boswell said .
" We just can't have a black face in a high place .
We have to have people fighting for policies that actually help us . "
Obama has responded to such criticisms before .
In his " A More Perfect Union " speech in March , he dismissed claims that his candidacy was fueled by the desire " to purchase racial reconciliation on the cheap . "
He acknowledged that racial disparities in education and wealth continued to exist and were linked to the legacy of Jim Crow and slavery .
" I have never been so naive as to believe that we can get beyond our racial divisions in a single election cycle , or with a single candidacy , particularly a candidacy as imperfect as my own , " Obama said during that speech .
A black backlash against Obama ?
Despite what Obama has said , his presidency could provoke a black backlash because the expectations are so high , others say .
African - Americans who would expect a President Obama to be a vigorous advocate for their cause may be disappointed by Obama 's approach to race if he becomes president , some say .
Author Street says Obama may be a symbol of bold racial change but he is personally cautious about race .
A President Obama wo n't want to appear to favor blacks , because he might lose political support if he appears as the " angry black man " in the White House .
Street says Obama understands that risk and has run as a " race - neutral " candidate who talks about racial oppression as something largely confined to the past .
" Barack plays a very active role in damping down race consciousness , " Street said .
" Race neutrality is one of the great characteristics of his campaign . "
African - Americans may also be disappointed by an Obama presidency because they may have forgotten what Obama is : a politician , says David Sirota , author of " The Uprising , " a book that examines how populist movements in America shape public policy changes .
" He 's like any politician .
He 's cautious , " Sirota said .
" He 's a potential vehicle for change , and I think he is a good vehicle , but he is just a vehicle . "
His presidency may represent fundamental change , but that does n't mean he will initiate such sweeping changes if he 's elected .
" Politicians , even the best - intentioned ones , are weather vanes , " Sirota said .
" If the wind is n't blowing in the right direction , they will perpetuate the status quo . "
It will take more than a presidential candidate to change the status quo ; it 'll take a movement , Sirota says .
" My concern is that people will think that by simply electing Obama , change will come , whether it's on race or economic justice issues , " he said .
" If people believe that , then real change will not happen . "

Applegate calls double mastectomy a `tough ' choice Associated Press
Published : Tuesday August 19 , 2008

NEW YORK ( AP ) -- Christina Applegate is taking the long view of her battle with breast cancer - the really long view .
Speaking on ABC News ' " Good Morning America " in her first interview since announcing her diagnosis earlier this month , the " Samantha Who ? " star said she had a double mastectomy three weeks ago .
She 'll undergo reconstructive surgery over the next eight months .
I 'm going to have cute boobs ' til I 'm 90 , so there 's that , " she joked in the interview , which aired Tuesday .
" I 'll have the best boobs in the nursing home .
I 'll be the envy of all the ladies around the bridge table . "
The 36 - year - old actress elected to remove both breasts even though the disease was contained in one breast .
She said she is now cancer - free .
Applegate called the operation a logical decision .
Her mother battled breast cancer , and she tested positive for the BRCA1 gene mutation linked to breast and ovarian cancer .
" I just wanted to kind of be rid of it , " she said .
" So this was the choice I made and it was a tough one . "
The experience has been an emotional roller coaster , she said .
" Sometimes , you know , I cry and sometimes I scream and I get really angry and I get really like , you know , into wallowing in self - pity sometimes , " she said .
" And I think that 's - it 's all part of healing , and anyone who 's going through it out there , it 's OK to cry .
It 's OK to fall on the ground and just scream if you want to . "
The Emmy - nominated " Samantha Who ? " star has kept her sense of humor intact .
" I 've laughed so much in the last three weeks , " she said .
" I love living , and I really love my life , and I knew that from this moment on it was only going to be good that was going to be coming .
Yeah , I 'll face challenges , but you can't get any darker than where I 've been .
So knowing that in my soul gave me the strength to just say , `I have to get out there and make this a positive . ' "
Applegate 's cancer was detected early through a doctor - ordered MRI .
She said she 's starting a program to help women at high risk for breast cancer to meet the costs of an MRI , which is not always covered by insurance .
Applegate is scheduled to appear on a one - hour TV special , " Stand Up to Cancer , " to be aired on ABC , CBS and NBC on Sept. 5 to raise funds for cancer research .
She has been nominated for an Emmy and a Golden Globe for the ABC show " Samantha Who ? " , in which she plays a woman who wakes from a coma with no memory of who she is .
In a recent immigration court case involving Turkish Islamic Leader , Fetullah Gulen , US prosecutors exposed an illegal , covert , CIA operation involving the intentional Islamization of Central Asia .
This operation has been ongoing since the fall of the Soviet Union in an ongoing Cold War to control the vast energy resources of the region - Uzbekistan , Azerbaijan , Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan - estimated to be worth $ 3 trillion .
Court Case
The scene for these dramatic disclosures was an application for a Green Card in the Eastern District Court in Philadelphia by " controversial Islamic scholar " Fetullah Gulen .
Gulen , who has been living in the United States since 1998 , argued that he qualified for the Green Card as " an extraordinarily talented academic . "
The court case was covered extensively by the Turkish press .
Leading Turkish newspaper Hurriyet reported :
" Gülen 's financial resources were detailed in the public prosecutor 's arguments , which claimed that Saudi Arabia , Iran , the Turkish government , and the Central Intelligence Agency , or CIA , were behind the Gülen movement .
It stated that some businessmen in Ankara donated 10 to 70 percent of their annual income to the movement and that it corresponded to $ 20,000 to $ 300,000 per year per person .
It added that one businessman in Istanbul donated $ 4 - 5 million each year and that young people graduating from Gülen 's schools donated between $ 2,000 and $ 5,000 each year . "
Another leading Turkish newspaper reported ( translated by Rastibini )
Among the reasons given by the US State Department 's attorneys as to why Gülen 's permanent residence application was refused , is the suspicion of CIA financing of his movement .
[ . . . ]
" There is even CIA suspicion " " Because of the large amount of money that Gülen 's movement uses to finance his projects , there are claims that he has secret agreements with Saudi Arabia , Iran , and Turkic governments .
There are suspicions that the CIA is a co-payer in financing these projects , " claimed the attorneys .
[ . . . ]
Among the documents that the state attorneys presented , there are claims about the Gülen movement 's financial structure and it was emphasized that the movement 's economic power reached $ 25 billion .
" Schools , newspapers , universities , unions , television channels . . .
The relationship among these are being debated .
There is no transparency in their work , " claimed the attorneys . "
Who is Gulen ?
Fetullah Gulen is " a 67 - year - old Turkish Sufi cleric , author and theoretician , " according to a recent profile in the UK's Prospect magazine .
Prospect ran a public poll last month to find the world 's greatest living intellectual .
Gulen ' won ' the poll after his newspapers alerted readers to the poll 's existence .
Gulen is also the leader of the so - called ' Gulen Movement ' which claims to have seven million followers worldwide .
The Gulen Movement has extensive business interests , including " publishing activities ( books , newspapers , and magazines ) , construction , healthcare , and education . "
Gulen and the CIA
The fact that the prosecutors in the court cite documents that claim that Gulen has been financed in part by the CIA is remarkable for a number of reasons , even though there have been strong suspicions about the CIA 's involvement in the Gulen Movement for years .
The Russian intelligence agency , the FSB , has repeatedly taken action against the Gulen movement for acting as a front organization for the CIA .
In December 2002 , Turkish newspaper Hurriyet reported :
" Russian secret service claims : Turkish religious brotherhood works for CIA
The FSB , the Russian intelligence organization formerly called the KGB , has claimed that the ' Nurcus ' religious brotherhood in Turkey has engaged in espionage on behalf of the CIA through the companies and foundations it has founded .
FSB head Nikolay Patrushev has mentioned the names of these companies and foundations , saying , ' The brotherhood engages in anti-Russian activities via two companies , Serhad and Eflak , as well as foundations such as Toros , Tolerans and Ufuk . '
Patrushev has accused the brotherhood of conducting pan-Turkish propaganda , of trying to convert Russian youths to Islam by sowing the seeds of enmity , and of engaging in certain lobbying activities .
These companies and foundations have turned up in the internet site of Fethullah Gulen [ alleged leader of the Nurcu religious community currently living in the United States who is a defendant in several court cases in Turkey , accused of engaging in anti-secularist activities . ] " "
Russia has banned all of Gulen 's madrassas , and in April of this year , bannedthe Nurcu Movement completely .
Gulen 's Madrassas
The Gulen Movement foundedmadrassas all over the world in the 1990's , most of them in the newly independent Turkic republics of Central Asia - Azerbaijan , Turkmenistan , Uzbekistan , Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan - and Russia .
These madrassas appear to be used as a front for enabling CIA and State Department officials to operate undercover in the region , with many of the teachers operatingunder diplomatic passports .
Why Central Asia ?
Central Asia , with its vast energy wealth , is of major interest to US oil and gas companies .
The region is also of key strategic interest in the ' Great Game ' as Russia , China and the US compete for dwindling energy supplies .
The US government has been using Turkey as a proxy to gain control over Central Asia via Pan - Turkic nationalism and religion .
Sibel Edmonds Case
Twenty six people wrote reference letters supporting Gulen 's application for a Green Card - most notably ex-CIA agent George Fidas , former Turkish ambassador Morton Abramowitz , and former CIA Deputy Director Graham Fuller who appears in Sibel Edmonds ' State Secrets Privilege Gallery .
I called Sibel Edmonds to comment on the latest revelations .
She said :
You 've got to look at the big picture .
After the fall of the Soviet Union , the super powers began to fight over control of Central Asia , particularly the oil and gas wealth , as well as the strategic value of the region .
Given the history , and the distrust of the West , the US realized that it could n't get direct control , and therefore would need to use a proxy to gain control quickly and effectively .
Turkey was the perfect proxy ; a NATO ally and a puppet regime .
Turkey shares the same heritage / race as the entire population of Central Asia , the same language ( Turkic ) , the same religion ( Sunni Islam ) , and of course , the strategic location and proximity .
This started more than a decade - long illegal , covert operation in Central Asia by a small group in the US intent on furthering the oil industry and the Military Industrial Complex , using Turkish operatives , Saudi partners and Pakistani allies , furthering this objective in the name of Islam .
This is why I have been saying repeatedly that these illegal covert operations by the Turks and certain US persons dates back to 1996 , and involves terrorist activities , narcotics , weapons smuggling and money laundering , converging around the same operations and involving the same actors .
And I want to emphasize that this is " illegal " because most , if not all , of the funding for these operations is not congressionally approved funding , but it comes from illegal activities .
And one last thing , take a look at the people in the State Secrets Privilege Gallery on my website and you will see how these individuals can be traced to the following ;
Turkey , Central Asia , Pakistan and Saudi Arabia - and the activities involving these countries .
Many of the people in Sibel 's State Secrets Privilege Gallery are closely connected to Gulen , and each other , as well as the operations that Sibel mentions .
Many of them have actively advocated for using Muslims to further their own needs - from Turkistan to Albania and Central Asia .
Marc Grossman , former State Department # 3 and former Turkish ambassador , and one of the key named individuals in Sibel 's case , is currently receiving $ 1.2 million per annum from Ihlas Holding , a Gulen - linked Turkish conglomerate .
Sibel has previously referred to Ihlas as ' semi-legitimate ' and ' alleged shady ' - and emphasized that Grossman 's current payoff is a result of services performed while he was in office .
Grossman 's predecessor as ambassador in Turkey was Morton Abramowitz - in fact , Grossman actually worked under Abramowitz in Ankara for a number of years .
During that period , the US opened an espionage investigation into activities at the embassy involving Major Douglas Dickerson , a weapons procurement specialist for Central Asia .
Dickerson and his wife , an FBI translator , later became famous when they tried to recruit Sibel to spy for this criminal network .
Abramowitz , who is not listed in Sibel 's State Secrets Privilege Gallery , wrote a letter in support of Gulen for his immigration case .
He has long advocated the use of Islamic fighters in furtherance of US interests , including the Afghan mujaheddin against the Soviets and the Kosovo Liberation Army during the war in the Balkans , acting as an advisor to the Kosovar Albanians .
Another player from Sibel 's Gallery is Enver Yusuf Turani - Prime Minister of East Turkistan , a ' country ' recognized by only one country , the United States .
East Turkistan , aka Xinjiang , is officially a part of China , and home to the Uyghur people and the " Eastern Turkistan Islamic Movement , " a UN - nominated terrorist organization " funded mainly by Osama bin Laden 's al - Qaeda network and received training , support and personnel from both the al - Qaeda and the Taliban regime of Afghanistan . "
In fact , the Uyghurs constitute a significant percentage of detainees - at least 22 - at Guantanamo Bay since 2001 .
Five of those have been set free , and were eventually sent to Albania , amid much controversy .
According to TurkPulse :
" One of the main tools Washington is using in this affair in order to get Turkey involved in the Xinjiang affair is some Turkish Americans , primarily the Fetullah Gulen team who are prosecuted in absentia in Turkey for trying to found a theocratic State order in this country because he runs his activities from the United States , his protégé .
Another Turk used in this affair is Enver Yusuf Turani , who is the self styled Foreign and Prime Minister of the East Turkistan Government in exile .
He has been an American citizen since 1998 .
Enver Yusuf is in close cooperation with Fetullah Gulen ...
Their activities for the government in exile are based on a report entitled " the Xinjiang Project " drafted by Graham Fuller in 1998 for the Rand Corporation and revised in 2003 under the title " the Xinjiang Problem . "
It emphasises the importance of the Xinjiang Autonomous region in encircling China and provides a strategy for it . "
In fact , Abramowitz and Fuller were key players in the establishment of ' East Turkistan , '
" proclaiming the government in exile within 4 - 5 months , starting in May ( 2004 ) and completing the proclamation in mid- September .
The ceremony was held at Capitol Hill under American flags in Washington . "
Two others from Sibel 's gallery , Sabri Sayari and Alan Makovsky , have been similarly involved with Gulen , Fuller , and Abramowitz - co-authoring booksand articles , making joint appearances , dinners etc .
Illegal Operations
Earlier I quoted Sibel saying
" And I want to emphasize that this is " illegal " because most , if not all , of the funding for these operations is not congressionally approved funding , but it comes from illegal activities . "
Where does this funding come from ?
Narcotics trafficking , nuclear black market , weapons smuggling , and terrorist activities .
As Sibel makes clear in her The Highjacking of a Nation article , the management of the heroin industry from the farms in Afghanistan to the streets of London and elsewhere " requires highly sophisticated networks , " from the protection of the convoys from Afghanistan through Central Asia to their final destination , to the laundering of the billions of dollars in proceeds in Central Asian casinos and financial institutions in Dubai and Cyprus .
" So , who are the real lords of Afghanistan ’s poppy fields ? "
Sibel asks .
The heroin trade finances al - Qaeda and the Taliban , but they are n't the real lords of the poppy fields .
Journalist Ahmed Rashid , author of " Taliban : Militant Islam , Oil and Fundamentalism in Central Asia " and other similar books about these issues recently noted on Democracy Now that a " cartel " controls Afghanistan 's heroin , which supplies 93 % of global heroin supply .
Sibel has been trying to tell us about these operations for years , but has been gagged by the State Secrets Privilege which was invoked citing certain ' sensitive foreign diplomatic and business relationships . '
These ' sensitive relationships ' have now been exposed to a degree , thanks to the immigration case against Mr Gulen - one of the Turkish operatives who have been fronting for the CIA in the Islamization of Central Asia , incorporating drug trafficking , money laundering , and the nuclear black market , and the convergence with terrorism .
One Last Question
At the end of our interview , Sibel asked me to leave you with this question :
" After 911 , the US Government engaged in mock investigations and shut down many small Islamic charities and organizations , giving the appearance of action in the so - called ' War on Terror . '
Why did they harbor , support and resource Fethullah Gulen 's $ 25 billion madrassa - and - mosque - establishment efforts throughout the Central Asian region and the Balkans ? "

Can you believe NONE of Glenn Greenwald 's articles in SALON.com come up in the first 3 pages of a Google NEWS ( not WEB ) search for " anthrax " ???
How can that possibly be , when numerous mainstream pundits have been commenting on and linking to his articles ???
Anthrax salon pulls one ( 1 ) - along with many articles commenting on and linking to his articles .
Anthrax Glenn Greenwald got NONE .
I ’m not using quotes on anything .
A couple of his articles are top hits in WEB searches :
Google WEB : Glenn Greenwald Anthrax
It ’s the NEWS searches where they are strangely absent :
Google NEWS Glenn Greenwald Anthrax
UPDATE : Stranger still , the Google NEWS search for Salon.com turns up NO hits on Salon.com in the 1st 3 pages ( I did n’t go deeper ) , but plenty of articles linking to Salon.com , including Greenwald ’s Anthrax reporting .
Entertainment Weekly , on the other hand , has the number one hit for EW.com , and EW articles are also featured in the search results .
EW.com is a site with a comparative amount of traffic to Salon.com , but is perhaps less “ news ” oriented ; unless you think events involving celebrities are more newsworthy than politics and false - flag attacks on the US government , media and American people .
See the graphic at the bottom of the page to get an idea of how this affects how many people will see his articles , when searching for NEWS on the Anthrax case .
Also , I set up a “ comprehensive ” Google Alert for " anthrax " on 8/1 or 8/2 ; it has n't returned a SINGLE link to a Glenn Greenwald article on Salon ( a mainstream NEWS website ) , and has actually only sent me one alert , period , despite the daily news coverage of the leaks ; have YOU gotten a Google Alert with a Greenwald article on Anthrax ?
Google NEWS indexes a lot of blogs , including OpEdNews.com , even the Diaries ;
In the past I ’ve gotten plenty of alerts including opednews.com articles and diaries .
Please try it yourselves , and set up some Google Alerts to see what results you get , and leave comments here .
Google NEWS is different from Google WEB ; the News site focuses on news / blog coverage relevant to current events , and this engine governs the vast majority of Google 's traffic for news .
I will not be surprised if the results have improved by later today or tomorrow , Google monitors whatever mentions it .
Salon.com ranks 1508 on Alexa as of now ; this means only 1507 websites are more popular .
None of the websites turning up in the Google NEWS rankings are anywhere near this popular ; some are above 500,000 .
A Google NEWS search of “ Glenn Greenwald ” , who has been writing for Salon.com since 2005 and has written 2 bestselling books does n't hit any of his Salon articles ; but check out the Google NEWS search results for " Stephanie Zacharek " , a much less famous writer who also posts at Salon .
How can Google NEWS be returning these hits on articles linking to Glenn Greenwald at Salon.com , and not be returning the article all these articles are linking to ?
The top hit for Glenn Greenwald Anthrax on Google WEB is “ Vital unresolved anthrax questions and ABC News ” , which has 573 comments , a measure of its popularity .
This August 1 article is his most commented one so far in the series , and the number of comments correlates with its position in the search rankings .
Searching “ Vital unresolved anthrax questions and ABC News ” on Google WEB gets 12,200 hits , and 2 ( two ) on Google NEWS .
These are GlobalResearch.ca and MediaChannel.org , fine sites , but neither of these 2 ( two ) sites are Salon.com , and neither get anywhere near the amount of traffic Salon.com does .
What a crappy service Godgle runs ; as soon as an alternative appears that gives better results , i'm kicking them to the curb ( Cuil.com is n't great - yet , anyway .
Heystaks.com is n't running yet , but might be good ; it uses but is n’t limited or controlled by Google , and is supposed to be less commercially oriented than some of the other multi-search engine services , who I wo n’t promote by naming them , as they ’re generally less useful than Google ) .
Google has one of the worst privacy records , in addition to aiding the Chinese Communist government ’s censorship , and they frequently eliminate relevant stories from search results and their Google Alerts service .
Is something wrong with my computer ?
Am I spelling " Anthrax " incorrectly ?
Or is something wrong with Google ?
This is making me feel Chinese , and gives meaning to the phrase " Do n't be Google " .
What are you afraid of , Google ?
Do n’t you believe in free speech and the sanctity of information ?
I know you ’re reading this ; you read everything that mentions you .
Who are you working for Google ?
Whatever will you do when consumers run from you to alternatives that will no doubt appear , because you are not providing the service people want ; relevant search results ?
You better calculate if the payoff of a close relationship with Big Brother is worth your getting marginalized and / or going under in the future .
Yahoo !
NEWS is * slightly * better ; but as the vast majority of people use Google to search , how do you think this is affecting the public 's understanding of the issue ?
Google ’s “ glitch ” or “ censorship ” actually might not be affecting whether or not people find out about Greenwald ’s reporting , given the number of articles returned in search results that link to Glenn Greenwald 's Salon articles .
However , the shoddy service will likely be making people start to question what 's wrong with Google and start looking for alternatives , even inventing them .
This is the information age , and the old disinfo models no longer work , to paraphrase John Albanese

Note : U.S. District Court Judge William G. Young labeled me a " rogue " juror in a 43 - page court memorandum issued July 25th .
I ’ve corrected them on my blog .
During jury service earlier this year I sat in a judge ’s robing chambers and was asked to take an oath that I expect no juror in American history was ever asked to take before or since :
" Would you be able to set aside your own reading of the Constitution , the judge ’s past instructions , and judge the facts based solely upon the judge ’s explanation of the law ? "
The judge , U.S. District Court Judge William G. Young took 43 - pages in a court memorandum last month to call me a " rogue " for not taking this unusual oath .
I ’m not always the quickest on my feet , but on the drive home from the courthouse that day I thought a clever reply would have been : " Other than the actual words that are written in the Constitution , what words would you have me substitute when I think of the Constitution ? "
I would n’t have given him such a smart - alec reply even if I had thought of it at the time , though , as I was worried about a contempt of court charge .
I stayed polite .
Judge Young ’s oath had two parts : 1 . Disregard the wording of the Constitution and 2 .
Follow only the instructions of the judge .
It was an oath to pledge to act as if we are not a government of laws , but instead act as if we are a government of men , respectively .
If I had taken the oath , the judge could have said " the law says all Italians are guilty " and I would have been bound to declare the defendant guilty because the defendant was of Italian heritage .
I did n’t take the oath , and was immediately dismissed from jury service .
The scene in the judge ’s robing chambers that day reminded me of a passage in Lewis Carroll ’s Through the Looking Glass , where Alice is talking with Humpty Dumpty , the latter having just taken words out of context .
In other words , Humpty Dumpty was lying :
" When I use the word , " Humpty Dumpty said , in a rather scornful tone , " it means just what I chose it to mean — neither more nor less . "
" The question is , " said Alice , " whether you can make words mean so many different things . "
" The question is , " said Humpty Dumpty , " which is to be the master — that ’s all . "
Judge Young ’s court presumed a world without an objective reality , just like Humpty Dumpty ’s worldview .
There ’s only my view and his view , and the only question is " which is to be the master . "
It ’s the kind of worldview that C.S. Lewis described as " Men Without Chests . "
In this world , there can never be such a thing as the law .
The law is a third thing , objective and distinct from both his opinion and my opinion .
When there ’s only his opinion and my opinion in a court , there ’s no law , and only politics .
I was dismissed from jury service exclusively for political reasons .
The whole robing room incident started because of a preposition : " among . "
The case I was on was a Mafia drug trial , U.S. v. Luisi , and Boston Mafia Capo Robert Luisi had been charged with " possession " of cocaine .
I asked the judge how the commerce clause of the Constitution ( " Congress shall have the power … to regulate commerce … among the several states " ) could apply to the Luisi case , as the prosecution in the case did not even attempt to document Luisi had transported drugs over a state line ( or , for that matter , conspired to do so ) .
In fact , every fact of evidence presented in the case that related to the drugs took place within Boston city limits .
This was not " interstate commerce . "
It was not even " intra - state commerce . "
It was " intra - city " commerce .
Such were the facts of the case .
I would not have hesitated to have convicted Luisi in a state court of possession charges , nor in federal court of trafficking charges with sufficient evidence .
Even if no drugs had actually been transported across a state line , but there was evidence of a conspiracy to do so , I would have voted to convict Luisi .
These were just ifs , however .
Luisi was charged of mere " possession " under the U.S. Constitution ’s commerce clause .
The limitations of the commerce clause on the ability of the federal government to ban mere possession of drugs is firmly established in history , as the 19th amendment ( which Congress felt obliged to pass in order to empower prohibition ) gives powerful testimony .
Madison ’s notes on the constitutional convention of 1787 gives even more powerful evidence .
But my primary reason for objecting was not the history , but rather the meaning of the word " among . "
I had to memorize prepositions back in 7th grade , and " among " was one of them .
I know the definition , and a review of various dictionaries after the court case confirmed that " among " is not a synonym for " within . "
Young did not take the trouble to correct me on my understanding of the word " among . "
He did not consult any " third thing " to prove a fact , such as a dictionary or historical record .
There ’s no need in a Humpty Dumpty world .
It ’s only his view and my view , and the only question was who was to be the master .
Young did not take the straight - out liberal view that the commerce clause was a " do whatever you want clause , " though in his Humpty Dumpty worldview of words it was n’t much different .
It means what he wants it to mean , nothing more and nothing less .
He asked me if I thought courts had sometimes " gone too far " in being liberal with the commerce clause , citing the Lopez gun case .
Young is a Republican appointee , and therefore supports the Second Amendment at least in part .
Thus , using the commerce clause to ban guns is " going too far . "
How far was " too far , " he never said .
Nor did he have to .
" Too far " was further than he wanted , or perhaps further than higher courts wanted .
The actual wording of the Constitution has no effect on the limitation of the clause , as far as Young ever established in the court record .
Again , it ’s only a question of who ’s the master .
The ironic thing about the Luisi case is that Young actually did a better than average job of explaining the law in the case , right up until the jury started to deliberate .
After that , he made entirely political — as opposed to legal — arguments and engaged in persistent jury tampering from the bench .
As a result , the defendant did not receive a fair trial in this case .
Judge Young ’s memorandum does say a few helpful things about the proper role of judges .
He appropriately quoted Marbury v. Madison , noting that it was the " the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is . "
Where he goes wrong is when he starts saying things like jurors are " not free to determine any constitutional questions about the law . "
Just because it ’s the judges ’ responsibility to say what the law is , it does not follow that no one else can say what it is .
Admittedly , only judges and lawyers have the training to read the complex statutes coming out of Congress .
These statutes need an " interpreter , " to use one of Young ’s favorite words , because much of what Congress puts out looks like a foreign language .
But the Constitution needs no such “ interpretation . ”
If there ’s doubt , we have both dictionaries and historical documents to consult to clear up any doubt .
The Constitution was written in simple , declarative English language sentences by farmers .
It was written in our name , “ we the people . ”
Not only does
Young ’s view belie the first three words of the preamble of the Constitution , “ We the people … ” , but his philosophy essentially charges every social studies and civics teacher across the country with conspiring to make their students ineligible for jury service .
Juries cannot judge the law , Young says , even though he makes all jurors who enter his courtroom swear an oath to judge the u201Cfacts and the law .
u201D
Just how wacky
Young is on this measure was revealed in his memorandum where he took pains to explain that the jury did n’t have the power to consider the First Amendment in the Callender trial under the Alien and Sedition Acts .
James Callender was a newspaper editor who criticized President Adams in print , and the Alien and Sedition Acts had — in a clear violation of the First Amendment guarantee of freedom of the press — criminalized criticism of the President .
Why could n’t the jury consider the First Amendment ?
Because the judge had told them not to , of course .
The opinion of the judge is all that matters to Young , not the clear and unequivocal wording of the U.S. Constitution .
During the trial , Young stated repeatedly that jurors can’t judge law but can only judge facts .
But that does n’t make any sense .
Jurors are charged with rendering a verdict of either " guilty " or " not guilty . "
How can a fact be " guilty " ?
How can a person be " not guilty " of a fact ?
Is n’t it more accurate to say that a person can only be guilty of law - breaking ?
" Guilty " and " not guilty " are moral terms ; they imply a right and a wrong .
" Facts " are neither moral nor immoral .
Facts are either true or false , but true or false does not imply a moral principle .
Juries must judge the law as well as the fact , which is why the federal oath of jury service requires them to judge both with guidance from a judge .
This was true even in Young ’s courtroom up until he made me swear a second oath .
Young usurps any meaningful function from juries .
In fact , Young ’s memo depicts juries as nothing more than props designed to give some pretended legitimacy to courts .
In his words : " Juries have established district courts ’ authority to u2018 say what the law is . ’ "
Indeed , if judges can legitimately instruct juries to enforce congressional bans against newspapers criticizing public officials , as Young clearly said they can , then juries are nothing more than stage props for pretended legitimacy .
I agree with Judge Young that it is not healthy to have juries “ nullifying ” laws .
I agree completely with his words that " no citizen is above the law , and none is free to make his own law . "
Jurors are required to uphold all law , even laws they do n’t like .
I would stress that Young ’s dictum applies even if the citizen is wearing a black robe and sits at the head of a court .
I am against the type of " rogues " Judge Young describes in his memorandum , the kind of people who ignore their oaths to judge the " facts and the law , " throwing the law to the wind to substitute their own political agenda .
But as a whole , the handful of " rogues " across the nation are far less dangerous to the rule of law than Humpty Dumpty judges .

People think that we 're reading less well online .
That may be true , but not for the reason they suggest
There 's a meme going round that I think we need to stamp on , quick , because I know you wo n't give this piece much of your time .
The reason for that is not because the internet is making you stupid , but because this piece will only appear on screens ( unless you print it out onto paper , you environmental villain ) .
The idea that " the internet is making me stupid " has gained some traction in recent weeks .
Nick Carr kicked it off with an article in The Atlantic magazine called " Is Google Making Us Stupid ? " in which , contrary to longstanding requirements of headlines that ask questions , the answer was not " No , next ! " but " Perhaps , yes " .
His line — roughly — is that access to all this information , and the tendency to leap around as we consume information in little chunks , means that we 're becoming unfamiliar with mastering long , complex arguments , and give up reading after a few screens of HTML .
Others chimed in , saying that they , too , found it hard to concentrate on things .
Well , sure , we have a lot more distractions these days .
There 's always the computer , and your mobile , so a tweet or a quick check on your Scrabulous game on Facebook is never far away .
We 're easily distracted , though I suspect that 's just part of how we 're built as humans .
Nobody criticises birds for being prone to fly away when we approach them ; it 's a defense mechanism against predators .
Humans , too , will flit around , given the chance , just in case we find something that 's fabulously useful to us .
But I think the root cause of all this handwringing is much closer to home than Google .
It 's the screens .
Reading on a screen is tiring .
You read slower on a screen .
Add in a non-optimal font ( sans serif , without the little marks you find at the ends of letters , works best on screen because it 's easier for the computer to draw ) and you have a recipe for slow reading .
It 's interesting to go back and see what Jakob Nielsen , the usability expert , was saying about this 10 years ago : " Low - resolution monitors ( including all computer screens until now ) have poor readability : people read about 25 % slower from computer screens than from printed paper .
Experimental 300dpi displays ( costing $ 30,000 ) have been measured to have the same reading speed as print , so we will get better screens in the future .
People will simply not read long texts at a reduced reading speed , so unless they have much better screens , electronic books will have a problem . "
He added : " Even when e-books gain the same reading speed as print , they will still be a bad idea .
Electronic text should not mimic the old medium and its linear ways .
Page turning remains a bad interface , even when it can be done more conveniently than by clicking the mouse on a " next page " button .
It is an insufficient goal to make computerized text as fast as print : we need to improve on the past , not simply match it .
" The basic problem is that the book is too strong a metaphor : it tends to lead designers and writers astray .
Electronic text should be based on interaction , hypertext linking , navigation , search , and connections to online services and continuous updates . "
( Interestingly , he said the two ideas that would work were print - on - demand , and downloadable audio .
Have you subscribed to Tech Weekly ? )
So this 25 % slower figure : is it true ?
Yes .
Other studies bear it out : this one in 1998 found that higher - resolution screens mean you read more accurately , though still not as fast as print ; another more recent one at Manchester University ( PDF or Google HTML cache ) found reading on paper 10 - 30 % faster .
There 's another thing about paper .
You 're not tempted to go and check your email .
I find I can read 5,000 - word pieces in the New Yorker magazine ( one of the last refuges of really long , well - written pieces , along with the London Review of Books ) as long as they 're on paper .
On screen , I have n't a hope : they 're about 10 screens long , and one does simply get tired of having to click through while retaining everything you 've read .
And there 's always the distraction of following a link that you wo n't have in print .
Computer screens , meanwhile , are still a long way from mimicking the quality — in terms of dots per inch — of paper .
Jeff Atwood of Coding Horror did an interesting comparison at the end of 2006 to show how far we have n't come , comparing commercial printing ( about 2,400 dots per inch , or dpi ) with a good , cheap printer will give you between 600 and 1,200dpi .
A typical computer display , by contrast , is between 72 and 100dpi ( in some cases up to 150dpi — though often the screen is then very small , so the letters of words become hard to read .
( There are other differences , which is that the screen has luminance , where the paper reflects light .
This , as you already know , is why you can read a computer screen at night . )
Atwood 's conclusion : " We have a long , long way to go before computer displays can get anywhere near printer resolutions . "
The only niggling question I have is whether anyone has investigated reading speeds for the Amazon Kindle , which has low luminance and a 167dpi screen .
That 's good , but it 's still a long , long way from paper .
( I can't find any studies about reading speeds on it ; perhaps it 's too early . )
OK , you 've read to the end .
You know now that the internet is n't making us stupid ; it 's just making us read slower .
Go on , go and check your email .
You 've earned it .
( CNN ) -- A German magazine quoted Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki as saying that he backed a proposal by presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Sen. Barack Obama to withdraw U.S. troops from Iraq within 16 months .
Nuri al - Maliki told Der Spiegel that he favors a " limited " tenure for coalition troops in Iraq .
" U.S. presidential candidate Barack Obama talks about 16 months , " he said in an interview with Der Spiegel that was released Saturday .
" That , we think , would be the right time frame for a withdrawal , with the possibility of slight changes , " he said .
But a spokesman for al - Maliki said his remarks " were misunderstood , mistranslated and not conveyed accurately . "
Government spokesman Ali al - Dabbagh said the possibility of troop withdrawal was based on the continuance of security improvements , echoing statements that the White House made Friday after a meeting between al - Maliki and U.S. President Bush .
In the magazine interview , Al - Maliki said his remarks did not indicate that he was endorsing Obama over presumptive Republican presidential nominee Sen. John McCain .
" Who they choose as their president is the Americans ' business .
But it 's the business of Iraqis to say what they want .
And that 's where the people and the government are in general agreement :
The tenure of the coalition troops in Iraq should be limited , " he said .
" Those who operate on the premise of short time periods in Iraq today are being more realistic , " al - Maliki said .
The interview 's publication came one day after the White House said President Bush and al - Maliki had agreed to include a " general time horizon " in talks about reducing American combat forces and transferring Iraqi security control across the country .
iReport.com :
What should the next president know about Iraq ?
The Bush administration has steadfastly refused to consider a " timetable " for withdrawing troops from Iraq .
In a statement issued Friday after a conversation between Bush and al - Maliki by closed - circuit television , the White House said that conditions in Iraq would dictate the pace of the negotiations and not " an arbitrary date for withdrawal . "
The two men " agreed that the goals would be based on continued improving conditions on the ground and not an arbitrary date for withdrawal , " the White House said .
In an interview to air Sunday on " Late Edition , " Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice told CNN 's Wolf Blitzer that " those goals are being achieved now , as we speak .
And so , it 's not at all unusual to start to think that there is a horizon out there , in the not too distant future , in which the roles and responsibilities of the U.S. forces are going to change dramatically and those of the Iraqi forces are going to become dominant . "
White House spokesman Scott Stanzel said al - Maliki had made it clear that such decisions will be based on continuing positive developments .
" It is our shared view that should the recent security gains continue , we will be able to meet our joint aspirational time horizons , " he said .
The prime minister 's remarks emerged as Obama visited Kuwait and Afghanistan before embarking on a tour of the Middle East and Europe to boost his foreign policy credentials .
He also plans to visit Iraq .
The Democratic candidate says he supports a phased withdrawal of troops , promising to remove all combat brigades from Iraq within 16 months of taking office if he becomes president .
McCain does not think American troops should return to the United States until Iraqi forces are capable of maintaining a safe , democratic state .
He has been a strong advocate of the 2007 " surge " to escalate U.S. troop levels and says troops should stay in Iraq as long as needed .
McCain says Obama is wrong for opposing the increased troop presence , and Obama says McCain 's judgment is flawed .
CNN 's Julia Weber and Jamie Crawford contributed to this report .

Chinese methods used to interrogate Gitmo detainees David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Thursday July 3 , 2008
Print This Email This The New York Times revealed on Wednesday that a chart of permissible interrogation techniques for detainees at Guantanamo Bay came directly out of a 1957 study of methods used by the Chinese to extract confessions from American prisoners during the Korean War .
The study by sociologist Albert D. Biderman was later used to train American soldiers in how to hold out against similar techniques .
That training program was then drawn upon by the CIA and the military for the techniques used at Guantanamo .
According to the Times , " The recycled chart is the latest and most vivid evidence of the way Communist interrogation methods that the United States long described as torture became the basis for interrogations both by the military at the base at Guantánamo Bay , Cuba , and by the Central Intelligence Agency .
... Mr. Bidermans 1957 article described ' one form of torture ' used by the Chinese as forcing American prisoners to stand ' for exceedingly long periods , ' sometimes in conditions of ' extreme cold . ' "
The Times added that " versions of the same chart , often identified as ' Bidermans Chart of Coercion , ' have circulated on anti-cult sites on the Web , where the methods are used to describe how cults control their members . "
A article in the Detroit Free Press commenting on the Times story noted , " If you wanted someone to tell you the truth , would you use coercive tactics that have been perfected in order to elicit false confessions ?
...
It 's depressing enough to learn that our interrogators have in effect been emulating 1950s tactics used against captured Air Force personnel .
But it 's downright frightening to think that they relied on a study of how interrogators could get their subjects to basically abandon reality as they originally knew it . "
However , ABC News legal correspondent Jan Crawford Greenburg disagreed with the Times , telling host Charlie Gibson , " These techniques that were on the chart were not considered torture .
And in fact , Biderman says in his report ... that when he told people some of these coercion techniques , they said , ' Is that all there is ?
Surely you can't manipulate people so easily . ' "
Greenburg added , however , " He then goes on in the report -- outside the chart -- to talk about specific torture techniques .
And that 's the fascinating question .
...
Which of those techniques were used ? "

The White House has categorically denied that it ordered the CIA to forge evidence that Saddam Hussein was conspiring with al - Qaida , a charge made by journalist Ron Suskind in his new book The Way of the World .
The credibility of the Bush press office is such that one is tempted to take it as confirmation .
There is an old joke about the guy who claimed he could tell when Henry Kissinger was lying , and when tested had a 100 % success rate .
When asked his secret , he says : " His lips were moving . "
In the great tradition of White House weaselling , in part revealed by Scott McClellan 's book , one notes that there is no denial that the so - called evidence was a forgery , and a very tightly specific repudiation of the White House 's role that actually leaves ten thousand several other ways for forgeries to make their entrances .
Indeed , in the light of Suskind 's descriptions of Dick Cheney 's hard work on providing deniability , the vice - president 's office is one such .
One question asked in the language of another expansive militarist empire is " Cui bono ? "
Who would benefit from such a forgery ?
It is clear that the allegations of an al - Qaida connection , like the equally spurious Niger yellowcake document , were intended to justify the war .
Suskind 's book should not be shocking to anyone .
Like Hitler 's Gleiwitz attack , and the Tonkin Gulf incident , the carefully fed suggestions of Iraqi involvement in the 9/11 attacks were crucial to getting public and political support for war .
That was what made the spurious WMDs so threatening .
Washington
Post polls showed that 70 % of the American public bought the al - Qaida connection , and indeed many of the troops apparently still do .
But there were no proven , or even likely ties between al - Qaida and Saddam .
Let us do the " just the facts " thing before the inevitable ad - hominem attacks on Suskind drive out his message .
The Ba'athists were secular nationalists until Saddam became expediently pious after the first Gulf war .
In addition , at no point did Saddam 's regime allow any Islamist organisations to threaten his monopoly of political power .
It was with mixed shock and amusement that I read Iraq 's answer to the UN anti-terrorism committee 's questionnaire , where the regime proved its impeccable credentials by citing its use of the death penalty for any remotely terrorist - linked offence .
The only connection is that the invasion let al - Qaida and sundry other fundamentalists into Iraq , and Saddam 's viciously efficient secret police were no longer in a position to deal with them .
As for the weapons , by the time President Bush ordered the attack , Hans Blix 's UN inspectors were in Iraq coming up blank in their search for weapons , confirming what Saddam 's own son- in - law Hussein Kamal had said during his defection , that Saddam had indeed disarmed years before .
It would certainly be likely that any defector like Tahir Jalil Habbush would say the same .
But former CIA director George Tenet 's statement in large measure vindicates Suskind 's points .
Intelligence agencies are there to provide evidence that suits their masters , not the truth .
Tenet says that Habbush " failed to persuade his British interlocutors that he had anything new to offer by way of intelligence , concessions or negotiations with regard to the Iraq crisis , " and that " There were many Iraqi officials who said both publicly and privately that Iraq had no WMD – but our foreign intelligence colleagues and we assessed that these individuals were parroting the Ba'ath party line and trying to delay any coalition attack .
The particular source that Suskind cites offered no evidence to back up his assertion and acted in an evasive and unconvincing manner . "
That meant that , unlike Ahmed Chalabi 's inventive sources , they were not providing the necessary excuses for war that their interrogators wanted to hear .
In summary , who are you going to believe : a Pulitzer Prize - winning journalist or a White House that has provably lied about WMDs , about al - Qaida , about torture and indeed about almost any other subject ?
In face of the fear of lese - majesté that afflicts most of Washington 's media and political operatives , Ron Suskind deserves support .
Although one has to wonder .
He is being published by Rupert Murdoch , whose hands - on approach to publishing leads one to wonder whether Fox , the Wall Street Journal and the rest are about to eat eight years ' worth of mendacious words .
Inhabitat ‘s Mike Chino just sent me a text : “ Check your gmail … ” Anyway , he ’s on the scene :
I swear to god this neighborhood keeps getting rougher ….
Today ( August 2nd ) at 12:00 noon I spotted this itinerant horde of bees slowly making its way down 14th street between Mission and Valencia .
The roving mass was apparently following a fugitive queen as she made her way down the block , clustering on top of cars and buildings with no concern for private property .
Police assured a concerned public that there was , in fact , an emergency beekeeper on his way , and that there was no cause for alarm .
Cripes !
Hope everybody ’s okay .
Thanks ,
Mike !
Update : Wendy was on the scene too .
She kind of just broke my heart by explaining that “ Emergency Beekeeper ” is not an official City of San Francisco job title :
the police did n’t even know that you could call a beekeeper .
they said they would put their number on file for future reference though .
before my bf called the beekeepers , the police had called the fire department .
they had no idea i guess .
And she says that sfbee.org is the place to find ass - kicking beekeepers should another emergency arise .
Thanks ,
Wendy !

Back in 1919 , Proffitt ’s opened their first department store in downtown Maryville , TN .
While it did n’t quite have the prestige of a big city department store like Saks Fifth Avenue , it certainly had the technology of one .
As customers entered the Proffitt ’s store , an electronic switch on the door would send a signal to the management office , advancing a counter for real - time traffic numbers .
Browsing through the various departments of goods , perceptive customers would have noticed that the over - sized price tags were actually Hollerith Cards , to be fed into tabulating machines for summarizing the day ’s sales .
Purchasing goods was snap , requiring nothing more than a few taps on the electronic cash register or simply a telephone call to the credit department through the intercom telephone system .
And certainly , no one could miss the pneumatic tubes , zipping around documents from department to department .
Proffitt ’s embrace of retail technology played a crucial role in its growth over the following years .
Each technological leap offered that much more of an advantage , allowing them to plan and expand the company .
By the 1960 ’s , the introduction of basic , strategic computer operations helped so much that they began to acquire other department stores .
However , all of those previous advancements paled in comparison to an innovation from the 1970 ’s : the computerized cash register .
Prior to computerized cash registers , sales and inventory management was arduous .
The accounting department had to transcribe paper receipt tapes into punch cards , sort the stacks , and then feed them into various programs .
Aggregating multiple stores in a timely manner ( especially in the days before overnight shipping ) proved to be almost impossible .
But the computerized register promised to change all this with same - day reporting .
The system that Proffitt ’s ended up purchasing had a fairly simple model .
In the central office ’s data center would sit a minicomputer that housed all inventory data , across all stores , in thing called a “ database ” .
Programmers could create virtually endless reports by simply “ querying ” this database .
Each cash register would read in a thing called a “ barcode ” from the tag , and then record the transaction to a built - in cassette tape .
When a cashier would finish her shift , she ’d simply take her drawer and the cassette tape to her supervisor , who would then count out the drawer and verify the records on the cassette tape with a computer terminal .
From there , the supervisor would place the tape into a “ special transmitter ” , press the TRANSMIT button , and wait until the light was green before removing it .
Behind the scenes , the transmitter dialed the corporate office and dumped the tape ’s data through its 300 - baud modem .
After an enormous preparation and training effort , the new system was rolled out on a Sunday and put into use the next day .
Aside from a few minor glitches , the deployment was a success .
Within a week , management was happily receiving all sorts of detailed sales reports from hours - old data and , needless to say , they were ecstatic .
A few months later , however , their attitude quickly changed .
Having no room in the management office , one of the stores had to place its “ special transmitter ” in the stock room .
One of the stockroom workers , recognizing the device as “ one of those things that plays the new - fangled cassette tape albums , popped in his Lynrd Skynrd album and hit the big green TRANSMIT button .
You know , to transmit it over the stockroom ’s intercom .
The “ special transmitter ” faithfully responded by dialing corporate , establishing a connection with the minicomputer , and playing the “ data ” contained on the tape .
And while the upload program certainly had validation code to ensure that - 1 of a product was n’t purchased , the validation code really was n’t prepared to handle Free Bird .
Nor was the error handling code , as it wrote Free Bird to a small UNEXPECTED_DATA field and eventually overflowed into other data fields – namely , the inventory and financial files – and just kept overflowing .
In the three short minutes that it took for the stockroom worker to realize that the transmitter was n’t quite a boombox , the entire inventory file had become corrupt .
Things went kinda downhill from there .
As the IT staff worked feverously to restore the database , they discovered another problem : the backups they had been making were entirely unusable .
All of the inventory and financial data , for all of the stores , had been lost .
Worse still , there was no way they ’d be able to get the system running before the next day .
After hearing the news from IT , management also realized there was yet another problem : no one had actually developed a manual process .
With everything barcoded , there was simply no way they ’d be able to make and record sales without working cash registers .
The following day , Proffitt ’s management made the difficult decision of closing each and every store .
Crews worked around the clock to manually reinventory every item , count every penny , and reconcile everything using printed receipts .
The process took three full days to complete .
Since that fateful day , Proffitt ’s has embraced yet another critical aspect of IT : disaster recovery .
And it seems to have helped .
The company went public in 1987 and had acquired a whole slew of other department stores in the years that followed .
In fact , almost ten years ago to this day , Proffitt ’s ended up purchasing Saks Fifth Avenue , and has been operating under that name since .

A simulated view of the Sun illustrating the trajectory of Solar Probe + during its multiple near - Sun passes .
For more than 400 years , astronomers have studied the sun from afar .
Now NASA has decided to go there .
" We are going to visit a living , breathing star for the first time , " says program scientist Lika Guhathakurta of NASA Headquarters .
" This is an unexplored region of the solar system and the possibilities for discovery are off the charts . "
The name of the mission is Solar Probe + ( pronounced " Solar Probe plus " ) .
It 's a heat - resistant spacecraft designed to plunge deep into the sun 's atmosphere where it can sample solar wind and magnetism first hand .
Launch could happen as early as 2015 .
By the time the mission ends 7 years later , planners believe Solar Probe + will solve two great mysteries of astrophysics and make many new discoveries along the way .
The probe is still in its early design phase , called " pre-phase A " at NASA headquarters , says Guhathakurta .
" We have a lot of work to do , but it 's very exciting . "
Johns Hopkins ' Applied Physics Lab ( APL ) will design and build the spacecraft for NASA .
APL already has experience sending probes toward the sun .
APL 's MESSENGER spacecraft completed its first flyby of the planet Mercury in January 2008 and many of the same heat - resistant technologies will fortify Solar Probe + .
( Note : The mission is called Solar Probe plus because it builds on an earlier 2005 APL design called Solar Probe . )
At closest approach , Solar Probe + will be 7 million km or 9 solar radii from the sun .
There , the spacecraft 's carbon - composite heat shield must withstand temperatures greater than 1400o C and survive blasts of radiation at levels not experienced by any previous spacecraft .
Naturally , the probe is solar powered ; it will get its electricity from liquid - cooled solar panels that can retract behind the heat - shield when sunlight becomes too intense .
From these near distances , the Sun will appear 23 times wider than it does in the skies of Earth .
The two mysteries prompting this mission are the high temperature of the sun 's corona and the puzzling acceleration of the solar wind :
Mystery # 1 — the corona :
If you stuck a thermometer in the surface of the sun , it would read about 6000o C. Intuition says the temperature should drop as you back away ; instead , it rises .
The sun 's outer atmosphere , the corona , registers more than a million degrees Celsius , hundreds of times hotter than the star below .
This high temperature remains a mystery more than 60 years after it was first measured .
Mystery # 2 — the solar wind :
The sun spews a hot , million mph wind of charged particles throughout the solar system .
Planets , comets , asteroids — they all feel it .
Curiously , there is no organized wind close to the sun 's surface , yet out among the planets there blows a veritable gale .
Somewhere in between , some unknown agent gives the solar wind its great velocity .
The question is , what ?
" To solve these mysteries , Solar Probe + will actually enter the corona , " says Guhathakurta .
" That 's where the action is . "
The payload consists mainly of instruments designed to sense the environment right around the spacecraft — e.g. , a magnetometer , a plasma wave sensor , a dust detector , electron and ion analyzers and so on .
" In - situ measurements will tell us what we need to know to unravel the physics of coronal heating and solar wind acceleration , " she says .
Solar Probe +'s lone remote sensing instrument is the Hemispheric Imager .
The " HI " for short is a telescope that will make 3D images of the sun 's corona similar to medical CAT scans .
The technique , called coronal tomography , is a fundamentally new approach to solar imaging and is only possible because the photography is performed from a moving platform close to the sun , flying through coronal clouds and streamers and imaging them as it flies by and through them .
With a likely launch in May 2015 , Solar Probe + will begin its prime mission near the end of Solar Cycle 24 and finish near the predicted maximum of Solar Cycle 25 in 2022 .
This would allow the spacecraft to sample the corona and solar wind at many different phases of the solar cycle .
It also guarantees that Solar Probe + will experience a good number of solar storms near the end of its mission .
While perilous , this is according to plan : Researchers suspect that many of the most dangerous particles produced by solar storms are energized in the corona — just where Solar Probe + will be .
Solar Probe + may be able to observe the process in action and show researchers how to forecast Solar Energetic Particle ( SEP ) events that threaten the health and safety of astronauts .
Solar Probe +'s repeated plunges into the corona will be accomplished by means of Venus flybys .
The spacecraft will swing by Venus seven times in six years to bend the probe ’s trajectory deeper and deeper into the sun ’s atmosphere .
Bonus : Although Venus is not a primary target of the mission , astronomers may learn new things about the planet when the heavily - instrumented probe swings by .
" Solar Probe + is an extraordinary mission of exploration , discovery and deep understanding , " says Guhathakurta .
" We can't wait to get started . "

An Easy Path for Terrorists
If you fly out of Logan Airport and do n’t want to take off your shoes for the security screeners and get your bags opened up , pay attention .
The US government is testing its “ Trusted Traveler ” program , and Logan is the fourth test airport .
Currently , only American Airlines frequent fliers are eligible , but if all goes well the program will be opened up to more people and more airports .
Participants provide their name , address , phone number , and birth date , a set of fingerprints , and a retinal scan .
That information is matched against law enforcement and intelligence databases .
If the applicant is not on any terrorist watch list and is otherwise an upstanding citizen , he gets a card that allows him access to a special security lane .
The lane does n’t bypass the metal detector or X - ray machine for carry - on bags , but it bypasses more intensive secondary screening unless there ’s an alarm of some kind .
Unfortunately , this program wo n’t make us more secure .
Some terrorists will be able to get Trusted Traveler cards , and they ’ll know in advance that they ’ll be subjected to less stringent security .
Since 9/11 , airport security has been subjecting people to special screening — sometimes randomly and sometimes based on profile criteria as analyzed by computer .
For example , people who buy one - way tickets or pay with cash are more likely to be flagged for this extra screening .
Sometimes the results are bizarre .
Screeners have searched children and people in wheelchairs .
In 2002 , Al Gore was randomly stopped and searched twice in one week .
And last week Senator Edward Kennedy told about being flagged and denied boarding because the computer decided he was on some “ no fly ” list .
Why waste precious time making Grandma Lillie from Worcester empty her purse when you can search the carry - on items of Anwar , a 26 - year - old who arrived last month from Egypt and is traveling without luggage ?
The reason is security .
Imagine you ’re a terrorist plotter with half a dozen potential terrorists at your disposal .
They all apply for a card , and three get one .
Guess which are going on the mission ?
And they ’ll buy round - trip tickets with credit cards and have a “ normal ” amount of luggage with them .
What the Trusted Traveler program does is create two different access paths into the airport : high security and low security .
The intent is that only good guys will take the low - security path , and the bad guys will be forced to take the high - security path , but it rarely works out that way .
You have to assume that the bad guys will find a way to take the low - security path .
The Trusted Traveler program is based on the dangerous myth that terrorists match a particular profile and that we can somehow pick terrorists out of a crowd if we only can identify everyone .
That ’s simply not true .
Most of the 9/11 terrorists were unknown and not on any watch list .
Timothy McVeigh was an upstanding US citizen before he blew up the Oklahoma City Federal Building .
Palestinian suicide bombers in Israel are normal , nondescript people .
Intelligence reports indicate that Al Qaeda is recruiting non-Arab terrorists for US operations .
Airport security is best served by intelligent guards watching for suspicious behavior , not dumb guards blindly following the results of a Trusted Traveler program .
Moreover , there ’s no need for the program .
Frequent fliers and first - class travelers already have access to special lanes that bypass long lines at security checkpoints , and the computers never seem to flag them for special screening .
And even the long lines are n’t very long .
I ’ve flown out of Logan repeatedly , and I ’ve never had to wait more than 10 minutes at security .
The people who could use the card do n’t need one , and infrequent travelers are unlikely to take the trouble or pay the fee to get one .
As counterintuitive as it may seem , it ’s smarter security to screen people randomly than it is to screen solely based on profile .
And it ’s smarter still to do a little bit of both : random screening and profile - based screening .
But to create a low - security path , one that guarantees someone on it less rigorous screening , is to invite the bad guys to use that path .

Unlike the people in Stalin ’s Soviet Union , no U.S. official risked disappearing into the prison for dissent .
Senior State Department and Defense Department official , field commanders , intelligence and FBI officers , and frontline soldiers dissented .
They were usually ignored .
A few were threatened with administrative sanctions ; a few were reassigned ; a few requested reassignment .
The possibility of dissent makes the silence and complicity of senior and frontline medical personnel in the abuse and neglect of prisoners that much more inexplicable and inexcusable .
– Dr. Steven H. Miles , M.D. , Oath Betrayed : Torture , Medical Complicity , and the War on Terror
Despite Dr. Miles ’s book , despite Jane Mayer ’s The Dark Side , despite reports such as the Physicians for Human Rights ' Broken Laws , Broken Lives : Medical Evidence of US Torture and its Impact , Americans still do n't have anywhere near a full picture of what happened after the Cheney - Bush administration decided to spit on the Geneva Conventions , redefine and fine - tune torture and treat human beings like the inferior creatures it thought them to be .
What we do know is horrible enough .
Most horrible of all is knowing that medical personnel and psychologists violated the most basic ethics of their professions – Do No Harm – by participating in and helping to design " enhanced " interrogations designed to break prisoners .
Some did break .
Some were killed .
This systematic torture focused on sensory and sleep deprivation , overstimulation , and dependency creation .
Massive amounts of pain and fear were also included .
For their part , psychologists " reverse - engineered " the military 's Survival , Evasion , Resistance , Escape ( SERE ) program – designed to help American soldiers and marines resist torture – as a means to teach interrogators how to employ torture against captives .
Let me repeat that .
Training established to help American prisoners of war cope with , or at least anticipate , their captors ' efforts to break them down was " reverse - engineered " as a means to break down prisoners at Guantánamo and " black sites " run by the CIA or military intelligence operations in Europe , Asia , North Africa and the island of Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean .
Talk about becoming the enemy .
We also know that , even after the supposed banning of some measures that had been previously approved by the Secretary of Defense , these techniques continued at the detention center at Guantánamo Bay Naval Base , and probably other prisons , even while the Inspector General was putting a seal of approval on the whole affair .
As Josh White wrote in the Washington Post last Friday :
At least 17 detainees held at Guantanamo Bay were subjected to a program that moved them repeatedly from cell to cell to cause sleep deprivation and disorientation as punishment and to soften detainees for subsequent interrogation , according to U.S. military documents .
Defense Department investigations of abuse had previously revealed that the program was used in a limited manner and only on high - value detainees , but the documents indicate that the program was far more widespread and that the technique was still used months after it was banned at the facility in March 2004 .
Detainees were moved dozens of times in just days and sometimes more than a hundred times over a two - week period .
Military police logs for cell blocks at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , show that guards used the program -- dubbed the " frequent flyer " program in official documents -- on numerous detainees and noted the program in their 2003 and 2004 records .
The logs , reviewed by The Washington Post , also indicate that the frequent cell movements took place on the same days a Navy admiral was visiting Guantanamo to assess possible detainee abuses .
The Defense Department claims the program stopped in 2004 .
A spokesperson told White that all prisoners are treated humanely .
Cough , cough .
" Frequent flyers . "
Think about the kind of mentality that not only designs torture methods but turns them into a joke .
Twenty - four - year - old Mohammed Jawad , who will soon go on trial by military tribunal for trying to kill U.S. forces in Afghanistan with a grenade , has sought to have all the charges against him dropped because of abuse he suffered , including that caused by frequent moves .
Air Force Maj .
David Frakt , Jawad 's lawyer , said the newly revealed records demonstrate that :
" ... no one actually knows the full scope of the abuses at Guantanamo " and that " all of these allegedly comprehensive investigations were whitewashes . "
" This is only the tip of the iceberg , " Frakt said .
" This program was approved at the highest levels .
...
It suggests that people had simply lost their ability to distinguish right from wrong . "
With all due respect to the major , that puts the best face on it .
Because among those engaged in vetting , monitoring and carrying out this program approved at the highest levels were some of the very people we count on to help us distinguish right from wrong .
In some cases , they evaluated the status of a prisoner and informed interrogators that he was good for another round or two of " questioning . "
This must stop , wrote psychoanalyst Stephen Soldz in a Sunday Boston Globe Op - Ed , Ending the psychological mind games on detainees :
Psychologists have been identified as key figures in the design and conduct of abuses against detainees in US custody at Guantanamo , the CIA 's secret " black sites , " and in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Psychologists should not be taking part in such practices .
Yet a steady stream of revelations from government documents , journalistic reports , and congressional hearings has revealed that psychologists designed the CIA 's " enhanced interrogation " techniques – which included locking prisoners in tiny cages in the fetal position , throwing them against the wall head first , prolonged nakedness , sexual humiliation , and waterboarding .
Jane Mayer ... reports that the central idea was the psychological concept of " learned helplessness . "
Individuals are denied all control over their world , lose their will and become totally dependent upon their captors .
What angers Soldz and hundreds of other professional psychologists and psychoanalysts is that their organization , the American Psychological Association , has taken an official position that the presence of psychologists makes detainees safer at interrogations .
That view , Soldz declares every chance he gets , is ludicrous .
In fact , the policy enables the torturers .
At the Chronicle of Higher Education , David Glenn writes that , according to Mayer 's book :
... Martin E.P. Seligman , a professor of psychology at the University of Pennsylvania and a former president of the psychology association , accepted a CIA invitation to lecture at a naval training center about his theories of " learned helplessness . "
Mr. Seligman 's widely respected research suggests that when people and animals are traumatized at random intervals , they tend to give up :
They stop seeking to rationally help themselves , and they stop responding to ordinary incentives .
Mr. Seligman insists that his 2002 lecture was intended only to help train U.S. soldiers to resist torture if they are captured .
But in his 50 - person audience that day were Bruce Jessen and James Elmer Mitchell , psychologists who operate a consulting firm that helped the CIA develop interrogation techniques that some critics have called abusive .
According to Ms. Mayer 's book , Mr. Mitchell has long been fascinated by learned - helplessness theory .
( Through a lawyer , Mr. Mitchell denied to Ms. Mayer that his CIA interrogation techniques were inspired by Mr. Seligman 's work . )
Few people in the psychology association believe that Mr. Seligman consciously assisted in the development of detainee abuses .
But many say that the association needs to make a more thorough public accounting of how the work of Mr. Seligman and other prominent members may have been misused by government agencies .
Soldz , and four other authors addressed the Seligman matter at some length in the July 23 issue of Dissident Voice :
This history , along with the current , well - documented authorizations for detainee abuse , should have provided sufficient warning to APA leaders and to individual psychologists about the moral risks in aiding the national security apparatus , especially under the present U.S. administration .
But the APA has not taken the lead in helping psychologists confront these dangerous ethical situations .
To the contrary , the APA has been insensitive to the use of psychological techniques in torture and to the role of psychologists in aiding that torture .
This insensitivity itself has shocked many psychologists here and abroad .
So , for the second year in a row , the issue of torture and illegal detention will be a hot one at the APA 's annual convention , which begins Thursday in Boston .
Soldz will be on hand for a protest .
In addition to rejecting the APA 's position on torture and interrogations , the protesters will be backing the candidacy of Dr. Steven Reisner for the presidency of the organization as well as the " Aye " vote on a referendum that would reinforce the first principle of the APA ethics code : " Psychologists strive to benefit those with whom they work and take care to do no harm . "
Reisner , a psychoanalyst , is a senior faculty member and supervisor at the International Trauma Studies Program , an adjunct professor of Psychology and Education at Columbia University , and a consultant to the United Nations on stress and trauma .
He is a leader of Psychologists for an Ethical Psychology , and , with Soldz and others , a leading critic of the APA 's position .
In April , the mail - in nominating procedure for the APA presidency gave Reisner the most votes ( more than 30 % ) of any of the five candidates who will compete with each other for the post in October ,
The mail - in referendum has tough opposition .
It states :
Be it resolved that psychologists may not work in settings where persons are held outside of , or in violation of , either International Law ( e.g. , the UN Convention Against Torture and the Geneva Conventions ) or the US Constitution ( where appropriate ) , unless they are working directly for the persons being detained or for an independent third party working to protect human rights .
You can read the entire resolution with all its whereases , pro and con statements and pro and con rebuttals here .
For the past few years , the APA bureaucracy and a good piece of the membership has played a game of on - the - one - hand / on - the - other - hand regarding the role of psychologists and psychoanalysts in the kinds of interrogations brought to us by Donald Rumsfeld and other outlaws in the current administration .
There 's just one problem with the APA 's hemming and hawing approach : Torture is not a nuanced issue .
The U.S. House Wednesday approved a housing bill that puts the federal government squarely behind home lending giants Fannie Mae ( FNM ) and Freddie Mac ( FRE ) .
The bill passed by a vote of 272 to 151 .
Fannie and Freddie , which are known as Government Sponsored Enterprises or GSEs , either hold or back about $ 5 trillion in mortgage debt - roughly half of the total outstanding home loans in the United States .
Although Wednesday 's bill was negotiated between the White House and bipartisan groups in both the House and Senate , a number of House Republicans leveled heated rhetoric in opposition to the measure .
Republican concerns crystallized around the idea that taxpayers might be put in the position of bailing out irresponsible investment decisions or helping to support speculators in the housing market .
Meanwhile , Democrats underlined the fact that the housing bill is the latest in a line of measures taken by the government to support the housing market and improve the .
Neither Fannie nor Freddie deal directly with homeowners , instead buying loans from banks and other mortgage lenders .
Still , the subprime lending crisis has fueled fears about the solvency of the lending giants and publicly traded stocks in the two companies have fallen sharply in recent weeks .
The fears prompted the Federal Reserve and Treasury Department to take steps to backstop Fannie and Freddie temporarily .
In addition , Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson called for swift congressional action to extend his authority to support and regulate the GSEs .
The House bill would allow the Treasury Department to extend existing lines of credit to Fannie and Freddie for 18 months and provides for a new regulator to oversee the companies .
The bill also calls for restrictions on executive salaries and dividends to shareholders until taxpayer funds are paid back .
In addition , the measure raises to $ 625,500 the amount of loans the companies can underwrite , according to a fact sheet put out by the House Financial Services Committee .
In speaking out against the bill during Wednesday 's debate on the House floor , Rep. John Boehner , R - Ohio , the Republican leader in the House , said he wished that he could support the bill but that it contained too many risky provisions for him to support .
The bill puts taxpayers " on the hook for billions of dollars " to bail out " scam artists , speculators and banks that made bad loans , " Boehner said .
" The worst loans held by financial institutions will be taken in by the FHA [ Federal Housing Authority ] and who 's going to pay the bill but the American taxpayer . "
Boehner added that allowing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to remain private companies that offer products that are explicitly supported by the federal government was a " recipe for disaster . "
Similarly , Rep. Jeb Hensarling , D - Texas , the chairman of the Republican Study Committee , an organization of more than 100 of the most conservative Republicans , lambasted the housing measure for allowing Fannie Mae 's and Freddie Mac 's executives to " privatize their profits and socialize their losses . "
Repeating a refrain he used last week during Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke 's testimony before the House Financial Services Committee , Hensarling said the GSEs ' executives had manipulated profits to award themselves bonuses by " cooking the books . "
Meanwhile , Rep. Barney Frank , D - Mass. , the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee and one of the chief architects of the bill , objected vehemently to Republicans , including Hensarling , who talked about a $ 5 trillion risk .
Frank cited a Congressional Budget Office report that there was a better than 50 percent chance that no federal funds would be needed to support Fannie and Freddie , and if they were it would likely cost about $ 25 billion over two years .
" How did $ 25 billion become $ 5 trillion ?
It 's fantasy , " Frank said .
" This is a $ 25 billion standby authority to prevent terrible economic damage . "
Frank also decried other aspects of the Republican rhetoric as " simply inaccurate and misleading , " noting that everything in the bill other than the emergency support for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac had been debated and voted on in previous House bills .
" The amount of misinformation here is enormous , " he said .
Citing President Bush 's decision Wednesday to lift a veto threat on the bill , Frank said the continual congressional opposition was a case of " the right hand not knowing what the far right hand is doing " - suggesting that conservatives are not in agreement about combating the measure .
Other House Democrats were as effusive in their praise of the measure as some Republicans were skeptical .
Rep. Gregory Meeks , D - NY , said the measure was " probably the most important bill we 're going to pass in this 110th Congressional Session . "
" A lot of the things in this bill go to the people of the United States , the taxpayers , " he said .
" It makes sure individuals keep their homes .
It makes sure individuals receive financial literacy … and unscrupulous lenders will be wiped off the map . "
Likewise Rep. Nydia Velazquez , D - NY , lauded the efforts of her colleagues in bringing the legislation forward quickly .
" The time to act is now , " she said , adding that the bill " protects a basic need of millions of Americans : affordable housing " adding that it " will restore investors confidence in the housing financial market . "
The White House had threatened to veto the measure out of concern about community development block grants to help communities buy and rehabilitate foreclosed properties , but that objection was waived Wednesday at the urging of Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson .
" Given that the housing legislation is so essential right now , and that we need it promptly , the President agreed to accept Secretary Paulson 's recommendation that it was more important to accept the bill in this form so that we could get the housing reforms in the form of the GSEs , and to go ahead and sign the bill , even though it has the CDBG money in it , " Perino said at a White House press briefing .

There are a variety of techniques and tools that can help get your code running more efficiently - faster , and using fewer system resources .
Performance and optimization overview
On Saturday we went to Columbus zoo , apart from enjoying the lions , penguins , birds , I have also learned 5 simple yet effective lessons in visualization .
1. Design your charts for kids – assume your audience knew bare minimum and curious
Above shown is a typical Zoo-mate info dashboard that you can see next to any animal in the Zoo , All the information that a kid needs to know to enjoy the reptile is shown there , a photo , whether the snake is venomous , what it eats , how endangered it is on a gradient scale and where its found usually .
2. Highlight information that is crucial , leave the rest
This is “ How to read a Chameleon ” next to Chameleon cage , quickly tells how to understand what you are seeing .
But if you need to know more about the colors , the research behind it , there is a bigger section beneath this .
3 . Use images , examples that your audience can relate to
This is the “ measure your ecological footprint ” exhibit .
They have actually shown various sizes of shoes to compare ecological footprint of various Nationals – India , China , World average , US ( not shown ) so that kids can easily understand the point .
4. Remember , your audience is there to look at you , listen to your story , the chart is just an enabler
This is outside the area where tigers are kept .
Obviously very few people stopped at this infographic , people are all curious to see the tigers .
But this chart does tell a very good point about declining tiger habitat across the world , they have used 2 colors per each tiger to convey the point .
No gradients or anything … just 2 colors , one for where tigers thrived earlier , and one for where they are today , and the point is obvious for even a kid .
5 . Finally , have fun
Outside the building where reptiles were kept , I found this .
Having fun in what you do is as much important as telling your story , selling your ideas .
Happy charting 🙂
Edward Tufte ’s books do a beautiful job of illustrating how to present huge amounts of information clearly and simply .
Well presented information is critical to good interface design , but it ’s not the whole story .
Guidelines on how to present complex functionality clearly and simply are harder to find .
I ’ve just spent two months carrying a terrible , ancient cellular phone and a mediocre non-Apple music player around the planet , and interacting almost exclusively with Windows XP terminals at internet cafes and hostels .
As my frustration with these poor interfaces grew , I started a rough list of interface design guidelines .
Here they are :
Read on for explanations and examples of good and bad design related to each one of these rules .
There is a great deal of overlap between some of them , and that ’s OK — they ’re just guidelines .
( Perhaps I , or someone else , will someday condense them into eight or nine fundamental principles of good interface design . )
The application interface should be fast and non-blocking .
If it can not be fast or non-blocking , it should appear fast and non-blocking by being immediately responsive .
Many old - school web applications had disclaimers next to submit buttons saying “ Click this button only once . ”
Submitting data over the network was n’t fast back in the days of 56.6 kbps modems , and it ’s still not fast enough today .
Most web applications now deal with this by disabling the submit button ( good ) or by changing it to a progress spinner ( better ) with JavaScript the first time it ’s clicked .
The application is n’t fast or non-blocking , but it imitates immediate responsiveness .
The application interface should be consistent .
The phone I traveled with had the standard five buttons between the screen and the numeric keypad .
When navigating through and controlling various applications , sometimes the left top button meant “ select ” , and sometimes it was the right top button .
And sometimes the center menu button also meant “ select , ” but not always .
This lack of consistency made it just plain impossible to develop a motor memory for “ select ” on the phone — I constantly had to think about how to select an item or confirm an action .
The cross-platform widget toolkit wxWidgets ensures that dialog boxes it creates match the standard order of OK , Cancel , Yes , and No buttons on whichever platform the application is running on .
Do n’t interrupt users in the middle of common , nondestructive tasks .
The basic , core functionality of the application should be free from confirmations , interruptions , dialog boxes , configuration questions , multiple steps , wizards , and other garbage .
Get out of the way and let users do what they need to do .
Windows XP ’s information bubbles that pop up out of the system tray , on top of other windows , are particularly egregious violators of this rule .
Dialog boxes in Windows and on Linux also break this rule , as an error in a background application can interrupt the user mid-task in another application .
Mac OS
X ’s design that puts dialogs into “ sheets ” attached to the parent window ensures that a dialog box never interrupts a task in a different application .
If one application , or the operating system , violates this rule , it can interrupt users while they are using a different application and therefore affect the usability of the entire system .
Websites for DTF publications like the New Yorker violate this rule when they split their articles up into multiple pages — maybe this is motivated by some weird desire to mimic turning of a page , but more likely it ’s to track readers and increase ad views .
Do n’t do it .
Reload ads and track readers with JavaScript if necessary .
Avoid notifying users of success .
In general , an application should allow users to assume that everything is successful unless they hear otherwise .
If a delayed or background process or command has completed , and notification of its success will help users to continue their work , then that notification must be radically different than failure notification .
Windows ’ information bubbles are a serious violator of this rule too .
When plugging a new device into a Windows machine , it will often emit three or four info bubbles , with a sequence of messages like this : “ New hardware connected , ” “ CanonSony XJ - 4000 PowerCyberShot found , ” and then “ Your new hardware is ready to use . ”
OS X gets this right ; plug in a camera and iPhoto launches , ready to import the photos .
It does n’t say , three times , that a camera has been connected .
i Photo launching is an implicit indication of a successful connection with the camera .
Lots of web applications are doing the right thing by putting success notifications in the page , in little unobtrusive boxes , and putting error messages in red , in a different place on the page .
Using dialog boxes for errors , confirmations , and informative messages , as most applications did for years , just trained users to always click “ OK . ”
Avoid giving users information that they can not use .
Users still must read , think about , and decide that the information is useless .
If the information is useless to begin with , why risk confusing them ?
Why slow them down to read it ?
Every time I plug my USB CF card reader into a Windows machine , it gives me an info bubble that says “ This device could function faster if it were plugged into a USB 2.0 port . ”
And it says this even if the computer has no USB 2.0 ports at all .
What are users supposed to do with this information ?
Run out and buy a USB 2.0 card ?
Or a new computer ?
How many non-technical users actually know what “ USB 2.0 ” means , and can correctly decide to discard this information ?
The information bubbles in the previous example fail here too .
Users do n’t need to know that new hardware has been connected , or what model of camera they just connected , because , he or she is the person who plugged the camera in .
When people are working together on a project , they do n’t call each other every thirty seconds to tell the rest of the team that they successfully typed another word into the report or entered another figure into the spreadsheet .
Rare , destructive actions should be harder to complete than nondestructive ones , but always possible .
Closing a file without saving or emptying the trash are examples of destructive actions .
If most of the actions in an application are destructive , consider building an action history with an “ undo ” command or a back button into it .
Make as many actions as possible nondestructive .
And do n’t just skip implementing destructive actions — building a web application without a “ delete account ” command is criminal .
For a long time , one of the t- shirt sites that I ’d used did n’t have a way to delete a shirt — just a blurb saying to email customer support with the shirt ID .
In the rare case where users do want to perform a destructive action , they are positive that they want to perform it .
If it ’s missing , the application seems ten times more unfinished and underpowered .
Give the user the chance to ask for forgiveness rather than forcing them to confirm a ( destructive ) action .
Gmail and other web applications are pioneering this one .
Rather than asking something like “ Are you sure you want to delete this conversation ? ” they provide a success notification “ The conversation has been deleted ” with an “ undo ” button next to it .
The insight here is that , although the application must provide a way to immediately abort a destructive action like this , 99 % of the time , users actually intended to perform the destructive action .
That should be the easy , one - click case , and aborting the destructive action should be the rarer , two - click case .
If the application pesters users with a confirmation dialog for destructive actions , users memorize a multi-step destructive command : click delete , then click OK — and when they accidentally delete the wrong thing , they miss the chance to abort .
Many , many applications are guilty of this .
Deal with application failure gracefully .
Do n’t lock users out or lose state in the event of an application failure .
Users witnessing an application failure are in the most stressful and worried mental state they will ever be in while using the application .
The interface for alerting users about an application failure and recovering from it should be the smoothest , simplest , most comforting part of the interface .
Preserve state , mode , and user input for as long as it is relevant , until the user saves or discards it .
Never make users answer the same question or enter the same information twice .
Was there an error when saving ?
Show the form again with everything the user entered .
Did the user switch the telephone keypad to Title Case ?
Stay on title case when the word is n’t in the predictive text dictionary and the user has to spell it .
Take advantage of the fact that computers are better at remembering than anything else .
Provide multiple , complete navigation paradigms .
Keyboard and mouse control , back and forward buttons , search and choose , scroll and jump , broad and deep , fast and slow .
Digital bedside clocks and watches are particularly bad violators of this .
Often they provide , to set the time , just “ up ” and “ down ” buttons , or “ fast up ” and “ slow up ” buttons .
With these two - button interfaces , users must hold down one of the buttons and watch the time change .
While performing boring , slow tasks like this it ’s easy for humans ( your users ) to get distracted , miss the target time , and have to go all the way around again , or back in the other direction , slowly .
A speed sensitive knob , like on analog watches , or even just ten numeric buttons , would be a much superior navigation interface .
The iPhone lets the user scroll slowly through their address book , or click on a letter and jump ahead in the alphabet .
The speed of the scroll when dropping an item into a long list in a scrolled window should depend on how far from the edge the item is being dropped .
Would an e-commerce site succeed with just browse - by - category and no search ?
The phone I carried had one button to cycle to the next word in the group of words offered by the predictive text system , but no way to go back to the previous word .
Press next too many times ?
Sorry , you have to cycle through all nine words all over again .
Design the interface before starting to code .
Even just a sketch will help — what commands and what functionality is going to be accessible ?
When and where ?
What will need extra heuristics ?
What will need custom widgets ?
What are the trouble spots ?
And do n’t just copy what some other application has done .
Even great interfaces have problems — copy what ’s good and improve what is n’t .
Did n’t design the interface before starting to code ?
Stop now and design it .
If the application violates one of these rules because its design makes implementation of a better interface too complex or too difficult , then the application needs to be refactored until it supports a better interface .
This one is sometimes the hardest to swallow — how could an application with a mathematically perfect algorithm and beautifully coded implementation of it need to be re-engineered ?
If the excuse for not implementing a powerful new feature is a back - end that ca n’t support it , then that back - end , no matter how awesome it is , is not good enough , and rewriting is the only option .
A better UI is one of the most powerful new features that can be added to an application , so if it requires a redesign and a rewrite , so be it .
Tipping points and international currencies :
Some thoughts on the delayed ascent of the US dollar in the 20th century
Marc Flandreau
Will the dollar lose its place as the premier international currency ?
This column argues that the previous episode of dethroning , in which the dollar overtook the pound , suggests that economic fundamentals , rather than network externalities , drive the choice of a great global currency .
Occasionally , it takes an economic historian to remind his economist colleagues that history may not matter as much as one would want to believe .
The recent depreciation of the US dollar sparked debate about its possible dethroning in the near future .
Such discussion is not new .
It has occurred repeatedly each time the US dollar faces adverse circumstances .
However , the recent combination of financial turmoil , a significant current account deficit , and bear speculation provides a favourable background for renewed concerns .
The attention these phenomena draw themselves is understandable .
But do they warrant worry about the dollar ?
One view , which has been mapped onto contemporary empirical evidence in a noted paper by Menzie Chinn and Jeff Frankel , is that rankings of international currencies change only very slowly , but when they change they do so with a bang .
As the story goes , although the United States surpassed the United Kingdom in economic size very early ( between 1860 and 1875 depending on estimates ) , the dollar did not surpass the pound as the number one international currency until 1945 .
When it did , however , the pound sterling was permanently dethroned .
Now , Chinn and Frankel note , the US dollar has steadily lost ground in the recent past .
London is usurping Frankfurt ’s role as the financial capital of the euro , notwithstanding that the United Kingdom remains outside the EMU .
They say that a tipping point could come within the ten - year horizon : the euro could overtake the dollar even as early as 2015 .
The reason usually put forward to account for the existence of tipping points is network externalities , or if you prefer , agglomeration economies .
Currencies are a bit like malls : you go there because you expect to find a variety of services .
Other customers do the same and sellers understand it .
In the end , the mall is amply furnished with all amenities .
And thus malls or more generally markets may survive somewhat longer than the reasons that led to their emergence in the first place .
Yet a point comes where the underlying geography does change so much that previously active malls become deserted .
Customers just start going somewhere else .
We observe the collapse of a formerly booming market place .
Such are the economics of tipping points .
But what do we really know of the reasons for the long delay in the ascent of the US dollar during the second half of the nineteenth century ?
In recent work I co-authored with Clemens Jobst , we took a fresh look at the issue .
Gathering information on the international reach of every single currency in the world , we articulated a model that enabled us to test for alternative determinants of international currency status .
We found strong evidence of size effects : the currencies of large trading powers tended to circulate widely .
We also found evidence of financial persistence .
The currencies that were actively sought by a large number of countries tended to be more liquid and , as a result , were more attractive , which boosted their use and liquidity .
Figure 1 summarizes the evidence .
It compares the outcome from a history - free scenario where there is no persistence with the actual performance of alternative currencies .
As seen , the US dollar was penalised by history , while some European currencies ( in particular the French franc ) were rewarded with a larger actual share than the history - free counterfactual suggests .

The graph presents the number of foreign markets in which currencies circulated .

Next , we examined whether the model we estimated generated strict persistence – whether currencies that had once reigned supreme would always reign supreme ( this is essentially a property of the elasticity of monetary demand functions to externality effects ) .
Results unambiguously rejected this stronger form of persistence .
One prediction of our model was that the US dollar ought to have managed to rival the pound sterling in the interwar period , rather than post - 1945 as conventionally believed .
Figure 2 simulates the incidence of an increase , other things being equal , of US trade with the rest of the world .
As can be seen , the simulated equilibrium is slightly above the observed one .
History matters , but not that much .
Or if you prefer this one : we cannot lay all the observed persistence at the door of network externalities .

Conclusion
Compelling evidence tells us history matters , but its importance ought not to be overstated .
The importance economists assign to agglomeration economics stems from the mismatch in the first half of the 20th century between the dollar ’s role in global commerce and the US ’s share of the global economy .
Our evidence suggests that fundamentals can explain this mismatch .
First , the US , a protectionist economy in the 19th century , was not a leading trade power in Europe until fairly late , so its share of global GDP mis-measures its importance in trade .
Second , the US and New York were not near the routes of European commerce , so the US was not conveniently located to capture a significant share of trade financing ; distance matters since the trade consignments themselves are natural collateral for such financing .
In plain words , a large fraction of the “ delayed ” ascent of the US dollar in the 20th century is fully in line with fundamentals – once they are properly measured .
We do not require references to the forces of history and agglomeration economics .
Occasionally , it takes an economic historian to remind his economist colleagues that history may not matter as much as one would want to believe .

Expert on bailouts : Bank regulators should investigate themselves Reuters
Published : Sunday August 3 , 2008
Print This Email This NEW YORK , Aug 3 ( Reuters ) - The United States is in the second inning of a recession that will last for at least 18 months and help kill off hundreds of banks , influential economist and New York University Professor Nouriel Roubini told Barron 's in Sunday 's edition .
Taxpayers will pay a big price for helping bail out the rest of the financial services industry as well , Roubini said -- at least $ 1 trillion and more likely $ 2 trillion .
The banks will become insolvent because of mounting losses as a result of the housing bust and because they have only written down their subprime loans so far , he said .
Still in front of them are their consumer - credit losses , for which they lack the reserves , Barron 's reported .
He also said there are hundreds of millions of dollars outstanding in home - equity loans that could be worth zero , too .
U.S. consumers , meanwhile , are " shopped out " and saving less , while the Federal Reserve 's performance in handling the crisis has been poor , Roubini said , because it failed to see that the problem extended beyond subprime mortgage debt .
Now , Roubini told Barron's , the government is overregulating , bailing out troubled participants and intervening in every market .
" The regulators should investigate themselves for bailing out Fannie Mae ( FNM.N ) and Freddie Mac ( FRE.N ) , the creditors of Bear Stearns and the financial system with new lending facilities .
They have swapped U.S. Treasury bonds for toxic securities , " he told Barron's .
" It is privatizing the gains and profits , and socializing the losses as usual .
This is socialism for Wall Street and the rich . "
He said that sometimes it is necessary to use public money to rescue institutions , but in a way that does not bail out the people who made the mistakes .
" In each one of these episodes , the government bailed out the shareholders , the bondholders , and to some degree , management , " Roubini told Barron's .
As for the banks that will go bankrupt , they will include community banks that finance homes , stores , downtown areas , commercial real estate and other mainstays of U.S. towns and cities , Roubini said .
" Of three dozen or so medium - sized regional banks , a good third are in distress , " he told Barron 's , saying half of the group could go bankrupt .
Some big banks could wind up insolvent , he added , but said they might be deemed too big to fail .
Nouriel stressed that he is " quite bullish " about the state of the global economy and that he is positive about the medium and long term .

Here is what you can ask : Five Questions to Ask before Buying a Hard Surface Cleaner .
I am sitting in a fast - food restaurant outside Boston that , because of a nondisclosure agreement I had to sign , I am not allowed to name .
I 'm waiting to visit Apollo Diamond , a company about as secretive as a Soviet - era spy agency .
Its address is n't published .
The public relations staff would n't give me directions .
Instead , an Apollo representative picks me up at this exurban strip mall and drives me in her black luxury car whose make I am not allowed to name along roads that I am not allowed to describe as twisty , not that they necessarily were .
" This is a virtual diamond mine , " says Apollo CEO Bryant Linares when I arrive at the company 's secret location , where diamonds are made .
" If we were in Africa , we'd have barbed wire , security guards and watch towers .
We ca n't do that in Massachusetts . "
Apollo's directors worry about theft , corporate spies and their own safety .
When Linares was at a diamond conference a few years ago , he says , a man he declines to describe slipped behind him as he was walking out of a hotel meeting room and said someone from a natural diamond company just might put a bullet in his head .
" It was a scary moment , " Linares recalls .
Bryant 's father , Robert Linares , working with a collaborator who became a co-founder of Apollo , invented the company 's diamond - growing technique .
Robert escorts me into one of the company 's production rooms , a long hall filled with four refrigerator - size chambers bristling with tubes and gauges .
As technicians walk past in scrubs and lab coats , I glance inside the porthole window of one of the machines .
A kryptonite - green cloud fills the top of the chamber ; at the bottom are 16 button - size disks , each one glowing a hazy pink .
" Does n't look like anything , right ? " Robert says .
" But they will be half - caraters in a few weeks . "
In 1796 , chemist Smithson Tennant discovered that diamond is made out of carbon .
But only since the 1950s have scientists managed to produce diamonds , forging them out of graphite subjected to temperatures as high as 2,550 degrees Fahrenheit and pressures 55,000 times greater than that of earth 's atmosphere .
But the stones were small and impure .
Only the grit was useful , mostly for industrial applications such as dental drills and hacksaw blades .
Over the past decade , however , researchers such as Linares have perfected a chemical process that grows diamonds as pure and nearly as big as the finest specimens hauled out of the ground .
The process , chemical vapor deposition ( CVD ) , passes a carbon gas cloud over diamond seeds in a vacuum chamber heated to more than 1,800 degrees .
A diamond grows as carbon crystallizes on top of the seed .
Robert Linares has been at the forefront of crystal synthesis research since he started working at Bell Labs in Murray Hill , New Jersey , in 1958 .
He went on to start a semiconductor company , Spectrum Technologies , which he later sold , using the proceeds to bankroll further research on diamonds .
In 1996 , after nearly a decade working in the garage of his Boston home — no kidding , in the garage , where he'd set up equipment he declines to describe — he discovered the precise mixture of gases and temperatures that allowed him to create large single - crystal diamonds , the kind that are cut into gemstones .
" It was quite a thrill , " he says .
" Like looking into a diamond mine . "
Seeking an unbiased assessment of the quality of these laboratory diamonds , I asked Bryant Linares to let me borrow an Apollo stone .
The next day , I place the .38 carat , princess - cut stone in front of Virgil Ghita in Ghita 's narrow jewelry store in downtown Boston .
With a pair of tweezers , he brings the diamond up to his right eye and studies it with a jeweler 's loupe , slowly turning the gem in the mote - filled afternoon sun .
" Nice stone , excellent color .
I do n't see any imperfections , " he says .
" Where did you get it ? "
" It was grown in a lab about 20 miles from here , " I reply .
He lowers the loupe and looks at me for a moment .
Then he studies the stone again , pursing his brow .
He sighs .
" There 's no way to tell that it 's lab - created . "
More than one billion years ago , and at least 100 miles below the surface of the earth , a mix of tremendous heat and titanic pressure forged carbon into the diamonds that are mined today .
The stones were brought toward the surface of the earth by ancient underground volcanoes .
Each volcano left a carrot - shaped pipe of rock called kimberlite , which is studded with diamonds , garnets and other gems .
The last known eruption of kimberlite to the surface of the earth happened 47 million years ago .
Diamonds have been extracted from almost every region of the world , from north of the Arctic Circle to the tropics of western Australia .
Most diamond mines start with a wide pit ; if the kimberlite pipe has a lot of diamonds , miners dig shafts 3,000 feet or more deep .
In areas where rivers once ran over kimberlite seams , people sift diamonds from gravel .
Loose diamonds used to turn up in fields in the Midwest in the 1800s ; they were deposited there by glaciers .
Most geologists believe that new diamonds continue to form in the earth 's mantle — much too deep for miners to reach .
The word " diamond " comes from the ancient Greek adamas , meaning invincible .
People in India have mined diamond gems for well over 2,000 years , and first - century Romans used the stones to carve cameos .
Over the ages , diamonds acquired a mystique as symbols of wealth and power .
During the 16th century , the Koh - i- Noor , a 109 - carat diamond from the Kollur mine in southern India , was perhaps the most prized item on the Indian subcontinent .
Legend held that whoever owned it would rule the globe .
" It is so precious , " noted a writer at the time , " that a judge of diamonds valued it at half the daily expense of the whole world . "
Great Britain got the stone in 1849 when Lahore and Punjab became part of the British Empire ; the diamond now sits in the Tower of London , the centerpiece of a crown made for Queen Elizabeth in 1937 .
And yet diamonds are simply crystallized pure carbon , just as rock candy is crystallized sugar — an ordered array of atoms or molecules .
Another form of pure carbon is graphite , but its atoms are held together in sheets rather than rigidly attached in a crystal , so the carbon sloughs off easily , say , at the tip of a pencil .
Thanks to the strength of the bonds between its carbon atoms , diamond has exceptional physical properties .
It 's the hardest known material , of course , and it does n't react chemically with other substances .
Moreover , it 's fully transparent to many wavelengths of light , is an excellent electrical insulator and semiconductor , and can be tweaked to hold an electrical charge .
It 's because of these admittedly unglamorous properties that lab - produced diamonds have the potential to dramatically change technology , perhaps becoming as significant as steel or silicon in electronics and computing .
The stones are already being used in loudspeakers ( their stiffness makes for an excellent tweeter ) , cosmetic skin exfoliants ( tiny diamond grains act as very sharp scalpels ) and in high - end cutting tools for granite and marble ( a diamond can cut any other substance ) .
With a cheap , ready supply of diamonds , engineers hope to make everything from higher - powered lasers to more durable power grids .
They foresee razor - thin computers , wristwatch - size cellphones and digital recording devices that would let you hold thousands of movies in the palm of your hand .
" People associate the word diamond with something singular , a stone or a gem , " says Jim Davidson , an electrical engineering professor at Vanderbilt University in Tennessee .
" But the real utility is going to be the fact that you can deposit diamond as a layer , making possible mass production and having implications for every technology in electronics . "
At the U.S. Naval Research Lab , a heavily guarded compound just south of the U.S. Capitol , James Butler leads the CVD program .
He wears a gold pinky ring that sparkles with one white , one green and one red diamond gemstone , all of them either created or modified in a lab .
" The technology is now at a point that we can grow a more perfect diamond than we can find in nature , " he says .
Butler , a chemist , pulls from his desk a metal box that brims with diamonds .
Some are small , square and yellowish ; others are round and transparent disks .
He removes one wafer the size of a tea saucer .
It 's no thicker than a potato chip and sparkles under the fluorescent light .
" That 's solid diamond , " he says .
" You could use something like this as a window in a space shuttle . "
The military is interested in lab - grown diamonds for a number of applications , only some of which Butler is willing to discuss , such as lasers and wearproof coatings .
Because diamond itself does n't react with other substances , scientists think it 's ideal for a biological weapons detector , in which a tiny , electrically charged diamond plate would hold receptor molecules that recognize particular pathogens such as anthrax ; when a pathogen binds to a receptor , a signal is triggered .
Butler , working with University of Wisconsin chemist Robert Hamers , has produced a prototype of the sensor that can detect DNA or proteins .
The largest single - crystal diamond ever grown in a lab is about .7 inches by .2 inches by .2 inches , or 15 carats .
The stone is n't under military guard or at a hidden location .
It 's in a room crowded with gauges and microscopes , along with the odd bicycle and congo drum , on a leafy campus surrounded by Washington , D.C. 's Rock Creek Park .
Russell Hemley , director of the Carnegie Institution 's Geophysical Lab , started working on growing diamonds with CVD in 1995 .
He pulls a diamond out of his khakis .
It would be hard to mistake this diamond for anything sold at Tiffany .
The rectangular stone looks like a thick piece of tinted glass .
Hemley and other scientists are using laboratory and natural diamonds to understand what happens to materials under very high pressure — the type of pressure at the center of the earth .
He conducts experiments by squeezing materials in a " diamond anvil cell , " essentially a powerful vise with diamonds at both tips .
A few years ago , Hemley created one of the hardest known diamonds .
He grew it in the lab and then placed it in a high - pressure , high - temperature furnace that changed the diamond 's atomic structure .
The stone was so hard that it broke Hemley 's hardness gauge , which was itself made out of diamond .
Using the super - hard diamond anvil , Hemley has increased the amount of pressure he can exert on materials in his experiments up to four million to five million times greater than atmospheric pressure at sea level .
" Under extreme conditions , the behavior of materials is very different , " he explains .
" Pressure makes all materials undergo transformations .
It makes gases into superconductors , makes novel super - hard materials .
You can change the nature of elements . "
He discovered , for instance , that under pressure , hydrogen gas merges with iron crystals .
Hemley believes that hydrogen might make up a portion of the earth 's core , which is otherwise composed largely of iron and nickel .
He has been studying the hydrogen - iron substance to understand the temperature and composition of the center of our planet .
In another surprising discovery , Hemley found that two common bacteria , including the intestinal microorganism E. coli , can survive under colossal pressure .
He and his colleagues placed the organisms in water and then ratcheted up the diamond anvil .
The water solution soon turned into a dense form of ice .
Nevertheless , about 1 percent of the bacteria survived , with some bacteria even skittering around .
Hemley says the research is more evidence that life as we know it may be capable of existing on other planets within our solar system , such as under the crust of one of Jupiter 's moons .
" Can there be life in deep oceans in outer satellites like Europa ? " asks Hemley .
" I do n't know , but we might want to be looking . "
Hemley hopes to soon surpass his own record for the largest lab - grown diamond crystal .
It 's not clear who has produced the largest multiple - crystal diamond , but a company called Element Six can make wafers up to eight inches wide .
The largest mined diamond , called the Cullinan diamond , was more than 3,000 carats — about 1.3 pounds — before being cut .
The largest diamond so far found in the universe is the size of a small planet and located 50 light - years away in the constellation Centaurus .
Astronomers with the Harvard - Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics discovered the gigantic stone a few years ago , and they believe the 2,500 - mile - wide diamond once served as the heart of a star .
It 's ten billion trillion trillion carats .
The astronomers named it Lucy in honor of the Beatles ' song " Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds . "
Natural diamonds are n't particularly rare .
In 2006 , more than 75,000 pounds were produced worldwide .
A diamond is a precious commodity because everyone thinks it 's a precious commodity , the geological equivalent of a bouquet of red roses , elegant and alluring , a symbol of romance , but ultimately pretty ordinary .
Credit for the modern cult of the diamond goes primarily to South Africa - based De Beers , the world 's largest diamond producer .
Before the 1940s , diamond rings were rarely given as engagement gifts .
But De Beers ' marketing campaigns established the idea that the gems are the supreme token of love and affection .
Their " A Diamond Is Forever " slogan , first deployed in 1948 , is considered one of the most successful advertising campaigns of all time .
Through a near total control of supply , De Beers held almost complete power over the diamond market for decades , carefully hoarding the gemstones to keep prices — and profits — high .
While the company has lost some of its power to competitors in Canada and Australia over the past few years , it still controls almost two - thirds of the world 's rough diamonds .
Diamond growers are proud of the challenge they pose to De Beers and the rest of the natural diamond industry .
Apollo's slogan is " A Diamond Is for Everyone . "
So far , though , Apollo 's colorless gems cost about the same as natural stones , while the company 's pink , blue , champagne , mocha and brown diamonds retail for about 15 percent less than natural stones with such colors , which are very rare and more expensive than white diamonds .
Meanwhile , consumers may well be receptive to high - quality , laboratory - produced diamonds .
Like most open - pit mines , diamond mines cause erosion , water pollution and habitat loss for wildlife .
Even more troubling , African warlords have used diamond caches to buy arms and fund rebel movements , as dramatized in the 2006 movie Blood Diamond .
Actor Terrence Howard wears a diamond lapel pin with Apollo stones .
He told reporters , " Nobody was harmed in the process of making it . "
Half a dozen other companies have begun to manufacture gem-quality diamonds using not CVD but a process that more closely mimics the way diamonds are created in the earth .
The method — basically an improvement on how scientists have been making diamonds since the 1950s — requires heat of more than 2,000 degrees and pressure 50 times greater than that at the surface of the earth .
( Both the heat and pressure are more than what CVD requires . )
The washing machine - size devices can't produce stones much larger than six carats .
These HPHT diamonds — the initials stand for high pressure and high temperature — have more nitrogen in them than CVD diamonds do ; the nitrogen turns the diamonds amber - colored .
For now , though , the process has a significant benefit over CVD : it 's less expensive .
While a natural , one - carat amber - colored diamond might retail for $ 20,000 or more , the Florida - based manufacturer Gemesis sells a one - carat stone for about $ 6,000 .
But no one , Gemesis included , wants to sell diamonds too cheaply lest the market for them collapse .
Gemologists plying everyday tools can seldom distinguish between natural and lab - grown diamonds .
( Fake diamonds such as cubic zirconia are easy to spot . )
De Beers sells two machines that detect either chemical or structural characteristics that sometimes vary between the two types of stones , but neither machine can tell the difference all the time .
Another way to identify a lab - produced diamond is to cool the stone in liquid nitrogen and then fire a laser at it and examine how the light passes through the stone .
But equipment is expensive and the process can take hours .
Diamonds from Apollo and Gemesis , the two largest manufacturers , are marked with a laser - inscribed insignia visible with a jeweler 's loupe .
Last year , the Gemological Institute of America , an industry research group , began to grade lab - grown stones according to carat , cut , color and clarity — just as it does for natural stones — and it provides a certificate for each gem that identifies it as lab grown .
The diamond - mining companies have been fighting back , arguing that all that glitters is not diamond .
De Beers ' ads and its
Web sites insist that diamonds should be natural , unprocessed and millions of years old .
" Diamonds are rare and special things with an inherent value that does not exist in factory - made synthetics , " says spokeswoman Lynette Gould .
" When people want to celebrate a unique relationship they want a unique diamond , not a three - day - old factory - made stone . "
( De Beers does have an investment in Element Six , the company that makes thin industrial diamonds . )
The Jewelers Vigilance Committee ( JVC ) , a trade group , has been lobbying the Federal Trade Commission to prevent diamond manufacturers from calling their stones " cultured , " a term used for most of the pearls sold today .
( People in the mined diamond business use less - flattering terms such as " synthetic . " )
The JVC filed a petition with the agency in 2006 , claiming that consumers are often confused by the nomenclature surrounding lab - grown diamonds .
From the beginning of his research with CVD more than 20 years ago , Robert Linares hoped that diamonds would become the future of electronics .
At the heart of almost every electrical device is a semiconductor , which transmits electricity only under certain conditions .
For the past 50 years , the devices have been made almost exclusively from silicon , a metal - like substance extracted from sand .
It has two significant drawbacks , however : it is fragile and overheats .
By contrast , diamond is rugged , does n't break down at high temperatures , and its electrons can be made to carry a current with minimal interference .
At the moment , the biggest obstacle to diamond 's overtaking silicon is money .
Silicon is one of the most common materials on earth and the infrastructure for producing silicon chips is well established .
Apollo has used profits from its gemstones to underwrite its foray into the $ 250 billion semiconductor industry .
The company has a partnership Bryant Linares declines to confirm to produce semiconductors specialized for purposes he declines to discuss .
But he revealed to me that Apollo is beginning to sell one - inch diamond wafers .
" We anticipate that these initial wafers will be used for research and development purposes in our clients ' product development efforts , " Linares says .
Before I leave the Apollo lab , Robert and Bryant Linares take me into a warehouse - like room about the size of a high - school gym .
It 's empty , except for large electrical cables snaking along the floor .
The space will soon be filled with 30 diamond - making machines , the men say , nearly doubling Apollo 's production capacity .
It will be the world 's first diamond factory , they say .
" There was a copper age and a steel age , " Bryant says .
" Next will be diamond . "

Part II : Fossil fuels for fossil thoughts

Part I
Molders of public opinion work in such insidious ways that their actual methods and means usually go unnoticed .
While inculcation of propaganda , lies , and disinformation do much of the shaping , simple omission has profound effect — might even be the favorite because it is , after all , nothing .
It ’s hard to imagine nothing ever accomplishing so much , but consider that for most people under common awareness manipulation , whatever corporate media ( CorpoMedia ) omits , to a large extent does n’t exist .
Flag - draped coffins streaming home in the dead of night from our war crimes in Iraq and Afghanistan are under media blackout , and so mean as little to most Americans as the actual reasons for the invasions , or even the hideous war crimes themselves .
By its nature , omission is all but limitless ; its application by CorpoMedia has grown to enormous proportions as celebrities and sports overpower hard news .
So this article focuses on omission of — the calculated disappearing of a single thing that for thousands of years has profoundly benefitted the health and well - being of people all over the world , and today offers so much more : Cannabis hemp .
6/26/08 , the Economist newspaper published : Better Living Through Chemurgy .
http://www.truthabouttrade.org/content/view/11985/54/
A decent article overall , at the end of paragraph one it points out that chemurgy is an ugly word ; subtle implications being that there might actually be something ugly about chemurgy itself ?
Chemurgy is a branch of applied chemistry focused on preparing industrial products and consumer goods from agricultural raw materials .
The term first appeared in William J. Hale ’s 1934 book The Farm Chemurgic .
The National Farm Chemurgic Council was formed a year later to foster greater industrial use of agricultural raw material — something ugly in ravenous petrochemical empire eyes … .
The Economist article lauds American scientist George Washington Carver for developing hundreds of industrial products from peanuts … then comes disinformation : “ In the 1930s , Henry Ford started using parts made from agricultural materials , and even built an ‘ all - soy car ’ ” .
Sorry , not “ all - soy ” — Ford made a car in 1941 of mostly resin-stiffened hemp fiber , with hemp plastic windows , and powered by hemp ethanol .
Soy resins were used , but it has always been known as Ford ’s Hemp Car .
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxlj6fgQ-ZU
Ford loved American farms , which by the mid-twenties were in an economic crisis that would worsen into the great depression .
Ford knew that creating new markets for farm products was essential , and with his political and financial backing , the Farm Chemurgy movement started taking off .
Ford also knew that with widespread cultivation , hemp could be an economic powerhouse — and that ethanol from hemp , or any other fermentable vegetable matter , was the fuel of the future , something widely agreed upon at the time in the automotive industry .
A favorite quote of Ford ’s : “ There ’s enough alcohol in one year ’s yield of an acre of potatoes to drive the machinery necessary to cultivate the fields for one hundred years . ”
His first Model - T was designed to run on hemp alcohol .
Rudolf Diesel designed the diesel engine to be powered by vegetable oils , such as from hemp seed ; at the 1900 world ’s fair he ran his new engine on peanut oil .
To the stupendous misfortune of virtually everything but Big Oil , the chemurgy movement was stifled by Big Oil .
A new National Energy Program was the subject of many bills in Congress , focused on utilizing part of Americas vast agricultural capacity for production of alcohol fuels .
Big
Oil responded with withering lobby power , including slogans such as the government ’s proposed energy program “ robbing taxpayers to make farmers rich ” .
Then , as now , whatever Big Oil wants , Big Oil gets .
Ford ’s vision of cheap , clean and renewable biofuels spooked early oil barons into keeping oil prices in the range between $ 1 and $ 4 per barrel — prices so low that no other energy sources could compete .
But once they were sure the competition had been killed off , the price of oil began to soar .
They were not only able to eliminate competition from alcohol fuels … but were instrumental in diddling government into effectively banning hemp cultivation — an incredible robbing of the people to protect entrenched corporate profits that still endures .
Food , fuel , fiber , paper , plastics , medicines … cannabis hemp could turn sunshine , water and carbon dioxide into many thousands of pollution - free products with today ’s technology .
Nothing else grows so prodigiously .
Hemp can be grown in all 50 states , needs no petrochemical inputs , actually improves the soil , and could be a powerful resource for mitigating global warming .
However , it ’s becoming obvious that the elite want catastrophic global warming to help further their population reduction plans — more on this in a moment .
Chemurgy attracting such renewed attention is certainly encouraging .
Though after reading more than a dozen new articles on the subject , I saw no mention of hemp … until I hit an article written by a hero regarding modern hemp awareness , Jack Herer .
His book on “ Hemp and the Marijuana Conspiracy ” : The Emperor Wears No Clothes has seen many printings since its debut in 1985 .
A true modern classic , Herer ’s book points out that not only has the word “ hemp ” been removed from all high school textbooks …he found that the Smithsonian Institution had also removed “ hemp ” from all exhibits , replacing it with “ other fibers ” — even though at the time referred to in the exhibits , hemp made up about 80 % of the fibers used , while the fibers mentioned by name , such as cotton and jute , played minor roles .
Herer questioned a museum curator about the absence of “ hemp ” , and was told : “ Children do n’t need to know about hemp anymore , it confuses them . ”
Well , when it comes to CorpoMedia , it seems a similar decision has been made for the entire population .
The fact that the National Congress of State Legislators has passed sweeping pro-hemp legislation , and the National Association of State Departments of Agriculture also vigorously support commercial production of hemp — as well as more than 15 states , most recently Vermont , having passed pro-hemp legislation … prime omission material for CorpoMedia .
Same thing as Congressman Ron Paul ’s “ Industrial Hemp Farming Act of 2007 ″ which has been comatose in the Subcommittee on Crime , Terrorism , and Homeland Security since April 20 , 2007 .
After all , what standard , PAC - fed politico from the world ’s leading trafficker of heroin and cocaine wants to appear “ soft on drugs ” ?
http://www.druggingamerica.com/ciadrugs/index_cia_right.html
Chemurgy without hemp is almost like fire without heat .
Hemp alone could produce more products than all other touted chemurgic candidates combined !
Any serious mention of chemurgy should boldly list hemp as the absolute superstar , but as usual … there ’s the political stench of Big Oil and its petrochemical empire .
Their latest subterfuge involves giving “ biofuels ” a bad name .
By using their legendary clout to help ramrod ethanol from corn , they have not only contrived the outrageous “ food - versus - fuel ” controversy , but also greatly expanded the massive dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico fed by petrochemical runoff from all the new acres of corn — all the while enhancing their profits with soaring use of petrochemical fertilizers and other petrochemical inputs .
http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/editorial/5924145.html
It takes as much if not more fossil energy to produce a gallon of corn ethanol as the energy available from that gallon .
The energy equation is helped somewhat by corn byproducts , but the bottom line in this heavily taxpayer subsidized boondoggle is : corn is one of the very worst crops we could choose for making ethanol , and hemp is probably the very best ; incredible political complications muddy this reality , but under the mud things are very clear .
So why not utilize hemp for biofuels , the most perfect solution available for not only the fuel AND food crisis , but also as a premier scrubber of greenhouse gas ?
This monumental question has the simplest of answers : entrenched profit , and agenda .
Hemp would force profits of Big Oil and its Petrochemical Empire to leak down to farmers …to the people — anathema to the elite .
Wealth must flow up , they insist , not down , so THEIR government ( CorpoGov ) keeps hemp buried with the “ marijuana ” contrivance , while CorpoGov ( and Wall Street ) reap trillions from the trafficking of heroin and cocaine , denying average people of the most valuable of crops to supposedly protect them from the “ menace of marijuana ” .
Could there be a better example of hypocrisy as a cornerstone of CorpoGov ?
Could there by a better example of the sense of it all than Ron Paul ’s federal hemp farming legislation being mummified in the Subcommittee on Crime , Terrorism , and Homeland Security ?
In all other industrialized nations this has been an agricultural consideration , meaning ALL other industrialized nations now benefit from hemp farming .
But here in the home of Big Oil… .
If instead of the obscene prohibition of more than 70 years , American farmers had been “ allowed ” to grow hemp , we might not be facing the intentional scuttling of America to make way for the elite ’s New World Order .
Perhaps America ’s wealth would not be concentrated in so few hands , and Big Oil with their Petrochemical Empire would not so dominate CorpoMedia and Corpogov .
Perhaps the Industrial Military Complex would not be the domestic and global monster it has become , and with goading White House psychopathology , might not have us at the brink of WWIII with imminent attack on Iran .
You ’ve seen the propaganda about Iran being the most evil incarnation this side of Nazi Germany … but along with Prescott Bush , who helped finance Hitler ?
http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2004/sep/25/usa.secondworldwar
And who can say that BushCo under direction of Dick Cheney is not as bad as they ’ve ever come ?
Look closely at the reality of 9/11 , especially what it has set in motion , by design .
If sheer human suffering is the benchmark …with their terminal legacy of depleted uranium munitions , along with all the outright murders — including 3,000 of their own citizens in one fateful day in September , does n’t it seem that BushCo / Cheney are treading beyond the brutality that capitalist propaganda whores falsely attribute to “ Uncle Joe ” Stalin ?
Back to hemp : if we rally the intelligence , dedication , and some of the spirit that got America going in the first place … nothing like hemp offers so much in reducing Big Oil and their Empire of CorpoGov and Industrial Military Complex and Global Predatory Capitalism .
This is the only reason hemp remains banned in America … .
Regional economies , wealth enriching its actual producers , healing of the planet ’s life - support systems — even if we find the spirit , do we still have time ?
Back to global warming : the sheer wealth and propaganda utilized by Big Oil to make it seem like what is happening is not really happening , that should be a dead giveaway .
If global warming caused primarily by runaway consumption of fossil fuels were not happening — were not dramatically accelerating as climate science professionals plus irrefutable evidence say , why would so much elite wealth be thrown at denying it ?
A main reason is that , for the elite , global warming is a maximum ally .
How else could their planned 90 % reduction of human population be so effortlessly achieved ?
Such is the essence of Part II … .

An MIT researcher has a vision : Four hundred huge offshore wind turbines are providing onshore customers with enough electricity to power several hundred thousand homes , and nobody standing onshore can see them .
The trick ?
The wind turbines are floating on platforms a hundred miles out to sea , where the winds are strong and steady .
Today 's offshore wind turbines usually stand on towers driven deep into the ocean floor .
But that arrangement works only in water depths of about 15 meters or less .
Proposed installations are therefore typically close enough to shore to arouse strong public opposition .
Paul D. Sclavounos , a professor of mechanical engineering and naval architecture , has spent decades designing and analyzing large floating structures for deep - sea oil and gas exploration .
Observing the wind - farm controversies , he thought , " Wait a minute .
Why can't we simply take those windmills and put them on floaters and move them farther offshore , where there 's plenty of space and lots of wind ? "
In 2004 , he and his MIT colleagues teamed up with wind - turbine experts from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory ( NREL ) to integrate a wind turbine with a floater .
Their design calls for a tension leg platform ( TLP ) , a system in which long steel cables , or " tethers , " connect the corners of the platform to a concrete - block or other mooring system on the ocean floor .
The platform and turbine are thus supported not by an expensive tower but by buoyancy .
" And you do n't pay anything to be buoyant , " said Sclavounos .
According to their analyses , the floater - mounted turbines could work in water depths ranging from 30 to 200 meters .
In the Northeast , for example , they could be 50 to 150 kilometers from shore .
And the turbine atop each platform could be big -- an economic advantage in the wind - farm business .
The MIT - NREL design assumes a 5.0 megawatt ( MW ) experimental turbine now being developed by industry .
( Onshore units are 1.5 MW , conventional offshore units , 3.6 MW . )
Stable enough for towing
Ocean assembly of the floating turbines would be prohibitively expensive because of their size : the wind tower is fully 90 meters tall , the rotors about 140 meters in diameter .
So the researchers designed them to be assembled onshore -- probably at a shipyard -- and towed out to sea by a tugboat .
To keep each platform stable , cylinders inside it are ballasted with concrete and water .
Once on site , the platform is hooked to previously installed tethers .
Water is pumped out of the cylinders until the entire assembly lifts up in the water , pulling the tethers taut .
The tethers allow the floating platforms to move from side to side but not up and down - - a remarkably stable arrangement .
According to computer simulations , in hurricane conditions the floating platforms -- each about 30 meters in diameter -- would shift by one to two meters , and the bottom of the turbine blades would remain well above the peak of even the highest wave .
The researchers are hoping to reduce the sideways motion still further by installing specially designed dampers similar to those used to steady the sway of skyscrapers during high winds and earthquakes .
Sclavounos estimates that building and installing his floating support system should cost a third as much as constructing the type of truss tower now planned for deep - water installations .
Installing the tethers , the electrical system , and the cable to the shore is standard procedure .
Because of the strong offshore winds , the floating turbines should produce up to twice as much electricity per year ( per installed megawatt ) as wind turbines now in operation .
And because the wind turbines are not permanently attached to the ocean floor , they are a movable asset .
If a company with 400 wind turbines serving the Boston area needs more power for New York City , it can unhook some of the floating turbines and tow them south .
Encouraged by positive responses from wind , electric power , and oil companies , Sclavounos hopes to install a half - scale prototype south of Cape Cod .
" We 'd have a little unit sitting out there and ï¿½ï¿½ï¿ ½could show that this thing can float and behave the way we 're saying it will , " he said .
" That 's clearly the way to get going . "
