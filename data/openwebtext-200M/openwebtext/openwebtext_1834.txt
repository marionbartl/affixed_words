Microsoft ’s MSN Spaces continues to censor its Chinese language blogs , and has become more aggressive and thorough at censorship since I first checked out MSN ’s censorship system last summer .
On New Years Eve , MSN Spaces took down the popular blog written by Zhao Jing , aka Michael Anti .
Now all you get when you attempt to visit his blog at : http://spaces.msn.com/members/mranti/ is the error message pictured above .
( You can see the Google cache of his blog up until Dec.22nd here . )
Note , his blog was TAKEN DOWN by MSN people .
Not blocked by the Chinese government .
Anti is one of China ’s edgiest journalistic bloggers , often pushing at the boundaries of what is acceptable .
( See a recent profile of him here , and an interview with Anti here . )
His old blog at the U.S. - hosted Blog-city is believed to have caused the Chinese authorities to block all Blog - city blogs .
In the final days of December , Anti became a vocal supporter of journalists at the Beijing Daily News who walked off the job after the top editors were fired for their increasingly daring investigative coverage , including some recent reporting on the recent police shootings of village protestors in the Southern China .
( For all the gory details on the current press crackdown click here , here , here , and here . )
Roland Soong at ESWN has preserved the original Chinese - language posts of Anti’s Call for a Beijing News Walk Out and his Call to Cancel Beijing News Subscriptions .
Roland also points to the likelihood that MSN ’s takedown of Anti ’s blog could be the result of dirty politics being played by at least one person at Bokee , China ’s largest domestically - owned blog hosting company – and naturally , a business rival of MSN spaces .
The ESWN blog has a translation of a column on Bokee ’s website which basically denounces MSN for hosting Anti .
An excerpt of the column :
Anti's moving over the MSN is a severely deplorable event in the development of Chinese blogging .
By moving his blog to MSN , he will influence a group of others to move their blogs to MSN .
Furthermore , we need to reflect : of all the BSP 's that Anti has used , how come only MSN was not shut down ?
Here , we must admire the cunning public relations methods of MSN .
We must also think that the Internet supervision departments are negligent about monitoring and controlling blogs , and that they have been lax with respect to MSN .
Our bottom line are being backed up step by step , and our market is being eroded step by step .
We issue the call : Rise up , and oppose the Microsoft monopoly of 2.0 .
Etc , etc .
Basically this author is calling on the authorities to put more pressure on MSN to censor more vigorously .
Roland reacts at ESWN :
The Bokee columnist wrote that the government 's Internet supervisory department should be paying attention to Anti 's blog as well as MSN Spaces .
Well , they did .
Whether this is the true reason or not ( and we will never know for sure ) , Bokee is going to go down in Internet history as calling in the Internet police to crack down on a blogger for exercising his constitutionally guaranteed freedom of speech and the police did just that , and the motivation of Bokee was commercial in nature ( that is , they want to use the government 's security apparatus to damage MSN Spaces as a competitor ) .
I know that this is one columnist 's opinion , but Bokee had better make it very clear that they did not support that opinion AND also they do not support the disappearance of the Anti blog .
This is particularly interesting in light of the observations I made in November on my trip to China : that the Chinese blogging scene is very divided and factionalized , and that the commercial blog hosting companies see people like Anti as a threat to their business .
Now , back to Microsoft ’s MSN and what they do , and how …
As it so happens , in mid-December I played around a bit with Chinese language blog - hosting tools to try and get a better idea of how they censor blogger content .
I have n’t posted about it yet partially because family business and vacation got in the way , and partially because I wanted to do a few more tests .
But given what happened to Anti I think I had better not wait .
Back over the summer I wrote a post titled Screenshots of Censorship about how MSN spaces was censoring the titles of its Chinese blogs , but not posts themselves .
According to my testing in mid-late December , they now censoring much more intensely .
On December 16th I created a blog and attempted to make various posts with politically sensitive words .
When I attempted to post entries with titles like “ Tibet Independence ” or “ Falun Gong ” ( a banned religious group ) , I got an error message saying : “ This item includes forbidden language .
Please delete forbidden language from this item . ”
However I was successful in posting blog entries with non-controversial titles , but with politically sensitive words in the text body .
For instance , a blog post titled “ I love you ” had “ Tibet independence ” in the text body , and a post titled “ I am happy ” had “ Falun Gong ” in the body , like so :
This was on Friday December 16th .
By Monday the 19th , the whole blog had been taken down , just like Anti’s was on Dec.31st , with an error message : “ This space is temporarily unavailable .
Please try again later . ”
Now ,
It is VERY important to note that the inaccessible blog was moved or removed at the server level and that the blog remains inaccessible from the United States as well as from China .
This means that the action was taken NOT by Chinese authorities responsible for filtering and censoring the internet for Chinese viewers , but by MSN staff at the level of the MSN servers .
I did similar tests with five other Chinese blog - hosting services .
They all work differently when it comes to censoring user content , but they all engage in some form of filtering or censorship of user content .
Interestingly , I found that Bokee had no mechanism preventing me from posting anything in the titles or text bodies of the posts .
But eventually , blogs with politically sensitive words in them ( like “ Falun Gong , ” “ Tiananmen massacre ” and “ Tibet independence ” ) were taken down in what appeared to be a human screening process , perhaps assisted by some kind of keyword search or alert system .
Other blog hosting services use a combination of automated systems and human procedures similar to MSN ’s , although MSN was definitely # 1 when it came to full takedown response time .
At least one of the services allows you to post anything , but replaces politically sensitive words with “ ****” when they appear .
I have decided not to go into a detailed naming of names and specifics about who censors more strictly and who censors more loosely than whom , since that will only result in some people getting in trouble – or as the Bokee editorial against MSN shows , some blog - hosting companies trying to curry favor with the authorities may try to sic the goons on those who take a lighter - handed approach to , er , user content management …
Can we say , snakepit ?
It ’s actually not uncommon in China for people in one company to actively “ tattle ” on their rivals and get them into political trouble in order to gain a competitive business advantage .
I saw it happen several times in the media and entertainment worlds when I was living and working in Beijing .
This is one reason the communist party will stick around longer than many outsiders think .
Businesses get greedy and try to manipulate the authoritarian system to their advantage , rather than working together to make the whole thing more fair , accountable , and transparent .
Microsoft clearly is n’t taking the high road either .
A slight postscript : John over at Sinosplice has posted an exchange with Roland of ESWN about why ESWN is n’t blocked , and they speculate as to why my blog has been blocked in China for the past several months .
John says it is currently not being blocked , or at least not from his ISP ( internet service provider ) .
Just to clarify : as far as I know , this blog was inacessible in China because since June all Typepad blogs appeared to have been blocked .
When I visited China in November , this blog and all other Typepad blogs I tried to access were blocked .
If it is now unblocked , it is because all of Typepad must be unblocked on at least some Chinese ISP’s .
I am not aware that my blog has been specifically targeted for filtering up to this point .
UPDATE ( 12:45 pm EST Tuesday ) : Robert Scoble is angry about MSN 's censorship .
He is looking into it and has sent a message to his colleagues : " Guys over at MSN : sorry , I do n’t agree with your being used as a state - run thug . "
He is also inviting Michael Anti to be a guest blogger on his blog .
UPDATE 2 ( 1:35 pm EST Tuesday ) : Anti has re-started his old blog on Blog -city .
It is hosted in the U.S. , and it 's unlikely that Blog - city administrators would respond to Chinese government appeals to take his blog down given that they do not have a Chinese business .
But still , the Blog - city URL is blocked by Chinese ISP 's so nobody inside China can see it without using a proxy server .
( For more info on how to use proxy servers click here , and for information in Chinese click here . )
To get around the block in China , Anti will be emailing his posts to subscribers .
He is also says he is going to resume his English blog at a new URL : Chinathinkbase.com .
His English blog has been providing some fascinating translations of recent writings by various Chinese intellectuals on social issues .
It 's an excellent example of " bridge - blogging " - introducing people in one language group to what 's being said in another language by translating , summarizing , and blogging about it .
I look forward to seeing more great work from Anti in 2006 , despite his troubles .
If a shortage of potatoes occurs either by lack of supply or by growth on demand the market price will rise .
This new higher price will signal to the farmers a need to produce more .
Supply will rise , meeting demand , lowering the price and bringing the market back into balance .
Warm Up
In spite of the mathematics behind it and the historical data supporting it , Peak Oil is often dismissed on the basis that ( free ) markets avoid such phenomena .
The so called Market “ Magic Hand ” purportedly guarantees that the right amount of a commodity is traded at the best price .
The “ Magic Hand ” will take care of any occurrences that momentarily disrupt this balance .
From a regular economist ’s point of view Oil is like any other good or commodity subject to the same rules above .
As you might suspect it is n’t so .
In the next lines we ’ll see why and what is the real role of Markets and Prices in Oil Depletion .
The Basics
For starters we ’ll use that old Price vs Quantity graph ( if you never heard of it I think you ’ll understand anyway , but you can learn more about it here or at Wikipedia ) .
On the yy axis is represented the Price , on the xx axis is represented the Quantity traded for the good or commodity in study .
To represent Demand a curve with downward slope is used - the higher the price the less consumers can by , as price lowers consumers are willing to buy more of the good .
Supply is represented in an opposite fashion – the higher the price the more goods producers are willing trade , at lower prices producers will not be willing to sell as much .
In real life Demand and Supply are not linear , hence called curves , but for didactic purposes are usually represented as straight lines .
These two curves meet at a specific point - the equilibrium .
If the Demand and Supply curves used represent the market correctly , the equilibrium point determines the price and quantity traded of the good in question , as seen below :
Market Equilibrium .
On an unconstrained Market , price and quantity traded are set by point where Demand and Supply meet .
Now imagine that consumers really like this particular good , or become more dependent on it , in that case they ’ll be willing to buy more than before .
This case is modeled by shifting the demand curve to the right .
As seen in the next picture a new equilibrium point will unfold , where more goods will be traded , but at a higher price .
The Demand curve shifts right to reflect a new will from consumers to buy more of the same good .
More goods traded at higher prices , this means profits for producers .
This new profitability will make the market attractive for new producers that will make more goods available to trade .
This new movement in the market can be modeled as a right - ward shift of the Supply curve .
The higher price set by the right shift of Demand triggers in its turn a right shift in Supply .
On a free market ( without price or quantity regulations ) after these two moves the final price will be the same as the initial .
Such is the market “ Magic Hand ” .
In a market with perfect concurrency ( goods are not differentiable from producer to producer ) goods are sold at the lowest price possible , and producers get virtually zero profits over base costs , benefiting consumers the most .
In the case of Oil this kind of movements happened constantly for about 20 years , from the mid 1980s up to 2004 , where global demand for Crude plus NGL moved up from 57 Mb/d to 80 Mb/d .
During that time
Oil prices moved very little , apart from the 1990/ 1991 period with the invasion and subsequent liberation of Kuwait .
Sometimes one tends to forget about this little detail , Oil demand has been a monster growing relentlessly .
So the regular economist might be right to some extent .
Before moving on give it a little thought : is the present Oil market a free one ?
Prices and Reserves
Among the financial and economic communities there seems to exist a hidden belief that Oil Reserves are set by prices .
If prices go up by growing Demand then Reserves should follow , in order to allow Supply to match it .
Even if Reserves grew with prices , it ’s the flow of Oil to the market that has to grow in order to meet Demand .
It ’s really hard to understand why such belief exists or what created it , because there ’s no physical or logic reason to think that way .
Unfortunately some institutions not only fail to dismiss such naive beliefs but even seem to propagate them .
Following is a graph produced by the IEA that leads one to believe in some sort of link between prices and recoverable reserves :
IEA ’s Reserves ties with Prices .
Hopefully the IEA has already made its act of contrition with the last World Energy Outlook , acknowledging energy supply problems in the next decade .
But what the economics and environmental folks remember is that nonsensical graph .
The amount of oil found at a certain reservoir was formed dozens of million years ago , it ’s a physical reality impervious to what happens above ground in the market .
Whatever the price of a barrel of oil , whatever the amounts of money oil companies hold , the amount of oil remaining in a reservoir is the same .
Pretty obvious , but hard to understand for some .
One could remotely argue that it is the money that oil companies hold that make it possible for the exploration of a certain reservoir .
But that money only represents the availability of surplus energy to produce more oil , what really makes a reservoir producible is the energy profit that it will yield .
As we shall see in the next section , the price of oil ( and in tandem the money resources that oil companies may hold ) are just mechanisms to set which reservoirs are more profitable and should come on stream first .
Money and Oil Flows
If it is the net energy that determines the amount of oil recoverable from a reservoir , what ’s the role of oil prices ?
Actually they have a very important role , they set at each point in time which reservoirs should be on production , pushing those with higher EROEI first and leaving those with lower EROEI for last .
To illustrate this effect let ’s use another parable : imagine there are two different energy sources available for exploration in an imaginary country ( it could be Melnibone if you like ) :
. Energy Source
A producible with an EROEI of 1:10 at a maximum rate of 10 energy units per time frame ;
. Energy Source B producible with an EROEI of 1:2 at a maximum rate of 20 energy units per time frame .
In the beginning there ’s one energy unit available got from human hard work , and energy demand of 9 energy units .
Although with larger reserves , energy source B does not provide enough profit for the current energy demand given such low input , so in the market it ’ll have a prohibitive price .
As for energy source A its market price will be lower and affordable , for it fulfills the entire energy needs of the imaginary country .
If supply keeps steady we have equilibrium , were at each time frame 10 energy units are produced , 1 to produce energy in the next time frame and 9 to meet demand .
A possible scenario where energy production gets started from source A , covering a Demand of 9 units per time frame .
Now imagine that demand rises to 12 energy units per time frame .
Energy source A wont suffice , energy source B has to come on stream .
In this case equilibrium will be achieved by producing 10 energy units from source A and 6 from source B .
In order to achieve this new equilibrium a period of turbulence will be underwent in order to raise the energy inputs needed to put source B on stream – this is where the price comes in to play .
Until the new equilibrium is found the price will go up reducing demand and opening space for higher investments in the following time frame .
After the new demand of 12 energy units is fully met the price will come back to its original value .
A possible scenario where a new effort has to be made to bring source B on stream .
After a period where total surplus diminishes a new Demand of 12 units is finally covered .
Take now a new scenario where energy source A goes in to depletion , diminishing 10 % per time frame .
The price will go up again to make possible the coming on stream of the full production from energy source B .
But after the depletion cycle is over only 10 energy units will be available for trade , the price will remain high to keep Demand low .
A possible scenario for source A depletion .
A new effort is made to bring source B into production but in the end the original Demand of 12 units can not be met .
Prices basically set the order by which Society uses the energy sources available , putting those with higher EROEI at front .
In light of this one can draw an interesting postulate :
A new energy source will come on stream on an unconstrained market if and only if all other energy sources with higher EROEI do not entirely cover current energy demand .
By doing so prices and markets guarantee that Society uses energy in the most profitable way possible .
The only problem is when the energy sources with higher EROEI are finite .
Another point worth observing is that the Market is in itself an Agent of Depletion .
It is the market that makes the low hanging fruit go first , producing the declining EROEI phenomenon observed in part I of this series .
The Regular Economist
If a shortage of potatoes occurs either by lack of supply or by growth on demand the market price will rise .
This new higher price will signal to the farmers a need to produce more .
Supply will rise , meeting demand , lowering the price and bringing the market back into balance .
What the regular economist does n’t tell you is that the farmer will need more oil to produce more potatoes .
It ’s that simple .
As long as enough energy is available the farmer can continue to adapt production to the signals sent by the market .
Now imagine that energy supply constraints prevent the farmer from acquiring more than some amount of fertilizers or diesel fuel , he wo n’t be able to meet a possible surge for potatoes .
The same with Oil , energy surplus has to be found to produce more of it , or else rigs will falter , access to reservoirs will not be possible , etc .
This is the major difference from Oil ( and energy sources in general ) to other commodities : more Oil ( energy ) has to be invested to produce more Oil ( energy ) .
Conclusion
Although we do n’t see the Market ’s Magic Hand has been working quite well for the last century , making sure that Supply meets a breathtaking surging Demand .
Major exceptions happened in 1973 ( OPEC embargo ) and in 1980 ( Iran - Iraq war ) but even then the Market prevailed , bringing things back to normal with time .
This “ Magic Hand ” is itself assuring that depletion will unfold by guaranteeing that energy sources with higher EROEI are explored first .
That way net energy keeps falling to the point where production can no longer tackle demand , eventually peaking and entering in decline .
Once energy scarcity unfolds there ’s little the Market can do about it , for to generate a higher supply of energy more of it has to be invested .
Traditional Economics fails to grasp this reality for it deals with energy like any other good or commodity .
The mainstream economic thinking does not acknowledge energy as a propelling factor of growth , even less as the major factor doing it .
Researchers like Robert Ayres , Charlie Hall , R. Kummell et al. have been trying with some success to estabilish this link between energy , money and economic growth , but that ’s a story for another time .

It ’s a great time to be an entrepreneur
There ’s never been a better time to be an entrepreneur because it ’s never been cheaper to be one .
Here ’s one example .
Excite.com took $ 3,000,000 to get from idea to launch .
JotSpot took $ 100,000 .
Why on earth is there a 30X difference ?
There ’s probably a lot of reasons , but here are my top four .
I ’m interested in hearing about what other people think are factors as well .
Hardware is 100X cheaper
In the 10 years between Excite and JotSpot , hardware has literally become 100X cheaper .
It ’s two factors – Moore ’s law and the rise of Linux as an operating system designed to run on generic hardware .
Back in the Excite days , we had to buy proprietary Sun hardware and Sun hard drive arrays .
Believe me , none of it was cheap .
Today , we buy generic Intel boxes provided by one of a million different suppliers .
Infrastructure software is free
Back in 1993 we had to buy and continue to pay for maintenance on everything we needed just to build our service -- operating systems , compilers , web servers , application servers , databases .
You name it .
If it was infrastructure , we paid for it .
And , not only was it costly , the need to negotiate licenses took time and energy .
I remember having a deadline at Excite that required me to buy a Sun compiler through their Japanese office because it was the only office open at the time ( probably midnight ) and we needed that compiler NOW .
Compare that to today .
Free , open source infrastructure is the norm .
Get it anytime and anywhere .
At JotSpot , and startups everywhere you see Linux , Tomcat , Apache , MySQL , etc .
No license cost , no maintenance .
Access to Global Labor Markets
Startups today have unprecedented access to global labor markets .
Back in 1993 , IBM had access to technical people in India , but little Excite.com did not .
Today , with rent - a- coder , elance.com and just plain email , we have access to a world - wide talent pool of experts on a temporary or permanent basis .
SEM changes everything
Ten years ago to reach the market , we had to do expensive distribution deals .
We advertised on television and radio and print .
We spent a crap - load of money .
There ’s an old adage in television advertising “ I know half my money is wasted .
Trouble is , I do n’t know what half ” .
That was us .
It ’s an obvious statement to say that search engine marketing changes everything .
But the real revolution is the ability to affordably reach small markets .
You can know what works and what does n’t .
And , search not only allows niche marketing , it ’s global popularity allows mass marketing as well ( if you can buy enough keywords ) .
So What ?
It ’s nice that it ’s cheaper , but what does it mean to entrepreneuring ?
More people can and will be entrepreneurs than ever before
A lot more people can raise $ 100,000 than raise $ 3,000,000 .
Funding sources explode which enables more entrepreneurs
The sources of funding capable of writing $ 100,000 checks are a lot more plentiful than those capable of writing $ 3,000,000 checks .
It ’s a great time to be an angel investor because there are real possibilities of substantial company progress on so little money .
More bootstrapping to profitability
With costs so low , I think you ’ll see many more companies raise angel money and take it all the way to profitability .
Higher valuations for VCs .
And , for those that do raise venture capital , I think it means better valuations because you can get far more mature on your $ 100,000 before you go for the bigger round .
All in all , it ’s a great time to be an entrepreneur .

Ok , I 'm really curious about this .
How could you possibly have gotten to a launch on $ 100 k ?
Please give some more details , otherwise this just seems like an exaggeration .
I mean , were you paying anyone in the US ?
Because $ 100 k will only get you 1/2 person - years .
Posted by : Anon | Jun 29 , 2005 11:43:29 PM
another set of good reasons :
* down round financing went from > 50 % in 2002 - 3004 to < 20 % in 2004 .
all the old crap is finally being flushed out .
* first round financing expanded 2 quarters in a row ( Q4/04 , Q1/05 ) , and seems to be on the way up .
now that the old crap is out of the way new crap can get funding !
( ok , so hopefully this time it 's not crap ... )
* Google 's IPO created another major portal that can provide acquisition liquidity for new ventures ; so now with MSFT , YHOO , GOOG ( and also IAC , AOL , EBAY , AMZN et al ) , there are a LOT of companies out there willing to buy startups with solid technology -- and thus more optimistic entrepreneurs and angel / VC investors .
* in addition to SEM creating instant traffic , AdSense & other online advertising networks can create provide a new form of instant revenue & monetization for startups ( albeit limited in most scenarios ) .
* a multiplicity of publicly available web services / hosted ASPs are making " mashups " a lot more prevalent , and people can now remix some very cool apps without having to build the entire technology stack from the ground up .
folks like Paul Rademacher can be a one - man band & create HousingMaps.com .
the technology DJ 's time has come .
yep , gotta agree ... time to buy shades :)

Posted by : Dave McClure | Jun 30 , 2005 2:46:32 AM
I am in hole hearted agreement with you but I have also added my own reasons :
* Simpler services are more successful
* Big is no longer cool
* Better frameworks
Which I expand on on my blog post .
I and many other people are trying to bootstrap without Angel Investors , which is something you will see a lot more of as well .

Let 's not forget the proliferation of broadband in the last 2 - 3 years ... lowering the barriers to adoption for any number of startup 's service offerings .
Here in the UK , there 's a direct correllation between the broadband ISP price war and the adoption of broadband services and content .
Posted by : Imran Ali | Jun 30 , 2005 4:50:16 AM
Our experience at Revieworld and Reevoo concurrs with what you are saying .
There is a positive attitude amongst UK investors at the moment .
There is a realisation that a lot can be done with little - " low cost model " is becoming a philosphy .
Everything can now be measured to maximise the benefit .
Technology ( software and hardware ) is cheaper but marketing ( a huge source of cost previously ) can be better controlled utilising the best of the old word off - line techniques combined with modern marketing ( adwords , viral , word of mouth etc ) .
Posted by : Richard Anson | Jun 30 , 2005 6:02:31 AM
I mean , were you paying anyone in the US ?
Because $ 100 k will only get you 1/2 person - years .
That 's just not true .
You'd be surprised how many people out there are working for peanuts on projects .
A lot of people balance their regular work with working on more entrepreneurial dreams , and $ 100 K would go a very long way indeed , especially for the young ( and most entrepreneurs these days are younger than ever before ) .

Interesting article .
i agree with most of what you said except on advertising , search engines will bring you qualified visitors but it will not give you massive reach , and definitely will not make your service popular like what the traditional media ( TV , etc ) did to Excite .
Thanks
Faisal
Posted by : Faisal | Jun 30 , 2005 2:48:39 PM
Yes it is a good time to be an entrepreneur .
I agree that net startups can be done on the cheap , and they should .
But wages still cost , and good talent is expensive .
Yes , you can offshore some of it , but you have better have a solid core base built before you go down that path .
Software development outsourcing is difficult , from the start you 've got cultural , communication and timezone issues .
Not to mention usually a misalignment of macro understanding of what the product is and how it should function .
I am just curious , if you really believe you can bootstrap the entire operation from start to exit , then why did you take in $ 6 MM in venture ?
Why dilute your equity more than you have to ?
I dont fault you for taking the cash , I would take as much money as I could raise ( you never know when / if your going to need it . )
Posted by : John | Jun 30 , 2005 11:17:16 PM
Another great way to save on advertising costs is to concentrate on Internet Adversiting .
I just posted on my website all about that area after attending a great marketing course .

It appears that the people best positioned to startup a new venture on $ 100 k are the ones that are already rich from their previous venture and thus can work for no salary .
I 've seen it first hand , a friend is starting ( co- founding ) a company and wanted me to join , and all his partner can argue back at me is , " See all these people working for me ?
They 're all working for just stock because at the last company they all made a million dollars . "
Great for them , super .
But I did n't ( yet ) , I want a salary .
Does that mean no startups for me ?
Posted by : Duane | Jul 1 , 2005 5:46:44 AM
I am surprised at the comparison drawn between Excite and Jotspot .
No offense , but to me , a search engine is a hell of a lot more algorithmic , tuning and systems work than a customisable wiki is !
Posted by : Ashwin Bharambe | Jul 1 , 2005 8:21:25 AM
I agree that it is a great time to be an entrepneur .
Aside from the lower cost of equipment there are more avenues to sell products and more ways to market your products .
With proven marketplaces like ebay and amazon.com , many people are starting their own small business to supplement their income whereas 10 years ago , a lot of these things were still grey area and were only for the strong willed .
Word of mouth marketing has never been better .
With the advent of blogs and popdcasting , getting a post on one popular blog can spark a firestorm of sales and increased visibility .
The internet now is not just the latest " new " thing , it 's just another outlet , which means that people have become more comfortable with it that has allowed them to embrace starting an online venture .
Posted by : adam | Jul 1 , 2005 8:39:50 AM
much of this has been in place for some time .
yahoo was bootstrapped with free software ... in 1995 .
cheap hardware too .
david filo was way ahead of his time , he was doing " cheap " when it was actually novel and often disputed ( you ca n't do this without sun boxes ! ) .
i credit him for the cheap revolution .
also note that these conditions draw many more players into the game and reduce margins .
when it costs $ 0 to start a business , you can likely expect $ 0 returns .

@ Ashwin :
" I am surprised at the comparison drawn between Excite and Jotspot .

That may true for some wiki projects out there , but it 's not true in the case of Jot .
If you had taken more than a cursory look at what Jot is doing , you would have realized that it is more than a " customizable wiki " .
It 's a large - scale hosted service that is a platform for building applications .

Hello Duane ,
I do not think so .
Here in Canada , I can leave with 15 k$ CND a year ( small accommodation , no car , some food and a monthly subscription for a place to train ) .
Could you ?
If so , you can easily bring 15 k or 20 k a year with small consultant contracts that will take only a part of your working time during a year .
The other part of your working time could then be use to start that dam startup :)
I do not think that the problem is cash , but much more one of work , hard work and patience .
Take care ,
Salutations ,
Fred

I could n't agree more .
Now is a great time to be an entrepreneur .
I have been using Rentacoder , adsense , adwords , and SEO to build and market content online .
So much infrastructure is available today that used to be prohibitively expensive and difficult to build .
I can accept payments using the new Paypal payments API , and I can promote my sites in a few minutes using adwords and other advertising programs .
It does take some money and know how to get started .
If you 're a business person with a great idea , it 's still fundamentally difficult to translate your vision for the business ( a web site , a community , a lead generation system , etc. ) into a product specification that engineers on services like elance and rentacoder can implement .
That said , the cost of getting things up and running is fundamentally several orders of magnitude lower than it was just a few years ago .
How do you get running on $ 100 K ?
You have most of your development done offshore using services like rentacoder and elance .
You hire contractors offshore as well as students to help write the content and marketing text for your sites .
You buy hosting at low cost from any of the many hosting providers ( so you own no hardware ) .
You promote your site or sites via advertising and organic search ( SEO ) .
It truly is a great time to be an entrepreneur .

" So much infrastructure is available today that used to be prohibitively expensive and difficult to build .

this is a decent way to build a small business , a second income etc. , but thats about it .
" How do you get running on $ 100 K ?

this is just clueless .
no 24/7 web service can live without oncall staff who know the code .
i do n't care if they are in sunnyvale or bangalore , you need someone on payroll who can solve mission critical issues asap .
oh yeah you can outsource your colo , but they are n't going to fix your mysql bugs .
all of these comments in any case revolve not around general entrepreneurial activity but setting up small - time websites .
duh !
this has been cheap for a long time .
also 99,999 people are your competitors , once again this approach is great if you want to make $ 20 k a year reselling purses .
tell me how i do advanced materials , alternative energy , biotech etc on the cheap .

Nice post .
Add to the list :
Employees who 've done it before
We take 10s of cycles off of projects these days because we have a core group of people that have built similar technologies before .
The hardware / software costs have diminished a lot , but so have the personnel costs .
Some of the time savings is because they have better tools .
Most of the time savings is because they are walking along well - worn paths .

He gives 8 similar reasons why now is the best time in the history of the world to start a company .
Posted by : Richard Miller | Jul 2 , 2005 10:26:45 AM
I definitely concur that it's an opportune and excellent time to be an entrepreneur and \or a startup .
In our case , we 're defying odds in spite of the fact that we 're located in a region of the world most people assume has
1) No innovation
2 ) Low penetration of technology .
My company , NEO ( New Enterprise Objects ) , is a budding startup specializing in levaraging mobile technology to explode the enterprise and provide an efficient distributed collaboration infrastructure .
Currently , 100 % of our staff ( 5 members ) are either consulting or employed full time .
All time spent coding , having meetings or strategising is derived from what I fondly call , " the night shift " , where the real hacking begins .
In addition , none of us is being paid any salary but is fueled by
1) The vision
2 ) The increasing value of the startup and our stake \stock in it .
Who could have thought that a startup in an LDC could be accelerating in the enterprise space with very little capital ( even much less than you 've indicated above ) and no full time employees ?
This truly is a wondeful time to be an entrepreneur .
Posted by : Nicholas Ochiel | Jul 5 , 2005 9:33:59 AM
The comments to this entry are closed .
There are people you ’ll see whom are outgoing and those seem to be very passive .
There are times when those people who are passive , get so loud that they seem too be too wild , they ca n’t keep quiet .
The opposite is true for those who are loud , but remain quiet for some time .
What ’s going on here ?
This could be the answer when it ’s time to learn to talk less with saying more .
For one , they may be around people who excite them , so those people end up talking your ears off or being too loud .
For those who are quiet , they may be around some people they seem not too get along with , or they may not like , or even more , simply do n’t know them .
In fact , here ’s a good example .
If you ’re live with roommates , your in - laws , or whomever , you may be loud at times with them , but , there comes the time when you simply want to stay silent at times .
It ’s not them , or maybe it is , but , there the time may come when you simply do not want to talk , to anyone .
How do you help them realize it ’s not them that you give the silent treatment to , it ’s you that want ’s to remain silent because you may have personal things you are dealing with .
Most of the time , the normal person will ask you : “ Is everything alright ? ”
Now , there may be a time when those same people have some exciting things going on with them , but you do n’t , so they end up being the loud ones .
You ca n’t blame them for talking … too much .
Let ’s all remain silent when the time is right , in order to let things go on gradually while be graceful .
When people speak , they should have a major ending or climax to their conversation .
If they ’re the “ story - telling ” type , take a seat .
It can be awhile until they get to their point .
Thing is , the listener should , if they have any wits , understand that these type of people are true “ story tellers . ”
Either way , you ’re stuck in their conversation , but without being rude , it ’s good to listen to what they have to say .
Why ?
Because one day you too will be that story teller .
Second , the “ comeback ” of the silent person .
These people will be so quiet , it ’s unbearable because they are n’t , in fact , outgoing , they do n’t have anything to say , they are n’t the storyteller , and they may not like you , period .
The long pause remains there and it can be effective .
This is when you can simply walk away , if you really do n’t care about the situation and that will remain “ as is . ”
In fact , the comeback of that quiet person after a long pause is can be effective .
When they end up talking , their point will be heard loud and clear .
They get straight to the point , and it ’s heard miles and miles away .
Is this the case of the passive aggressive type , where they pay back for being silent all those times ?
It certainly could be the case .
Actually , it is either that or during the times they were quiet , they were thinking of other things , remember “ it ’s not all about you . ”
It is n’t difficult to do it either , if you want to .
When it ’s time to think and time to talk is when the senses , hopefully the wits , come out too .
It can earn people ’s respect if knowing when to be silent is going to help the entire conversation , or the sit -in .
The true fact is that people can figure out who they are around by the first moment .
If you come across a person who is an extrovert , a person outgoing , to a person who is an introvert , the opposite , you ’ll know when to remain silent .
The main element is that as long as you know yourself , and those you care about is when silence and talking can work .
If you know it ’s hard to be quiet , then it can be difficult for those who ca n’t stand these types .
It ’s not you , nor them , it ’s simply that “ mix ” that do n’t “ mix . ”
All you have to do is act the opposite , if you care , to remain silent or talkative .
In fact , there could be some conflict that will remain avoided .
It can also help with relationships , as well as friendships .
Knowing when to is the trick .
It ’s knowing when and where to do this that is very critical .
Finally , when you can tell the difference , bite your tongue , or countdown from 100 , or 50 to yourself , or sing a song of six - pence , to yourself , and see if that works , when that time comes to remain silent .
It can really depend on a person ’s personality and if you know how he / she is around people or just you .
Opting out of prescreened offers of credit might also be useful when you apply for a mortgage .
When you seek a loan , the credit bureaus notice and they put you on a “ trigger list . ”
The information that you are a ripe prospect is then sold to other lenders in as little time as 24 hours .
Suddenly , other lenders are calling .
“ It hurts the image of our members , ” said Harry Dinham , president of the National Association of Mortgage Brokers .
His group also objects because it could be “ an avenue to identity theft . ”
He said , “ We actually do n’t know who they sell it to . ”
Still , some callers may actually have better deals than the one your mortgage broker or bank is offering .
“ Do you want to opt out and never learn how to save money , ” asked Stuart Pratt , president of the Consumer Data Industry Association , a trade group .
Will opting out protect your identity from thieves ?
Mr. Pratt said that “ lender data tells us that prescreened offers of credit result in lower levels of fraud . ”
Nonetheless , he did recommend using a paper shredder on the offers you do reject .
CREDIT FREEZE
The ultimate opt - out for your credit is a credit freeze .
You ’ll sometimes hear it recommended as a way to protect yourself from fraud because once you sign up to have your credit report frozen , no company can get access to your credit report without your expressed permission .
That means no one can open up a credit card or take out a loan in your name .
Think long and hard before you do this .
It sounds great at first , but doing so can backfire .
You might be buying an expensive flat - screen TV at a warehouse store and want to get the instant credit card to score another 5 percent discount .
You will not be able to .
But about half the states have passed laws making credit reporting companies quickly unfreeze a report , some in as little as five minutes .
Not that preventing the opening of one more store account is a bad thing .
Remember that everyone of those cards can hurt your credit score , which determines what your interest rate is when you borrow money .
Roger Nelson has a simple and unequivocal message for the people of the year 12006 : Do n’t dig here .
As chief scientist of the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant , Nelson oversees a cavernous salt mine that is the first geological lockbox for the “ fiendishly toxic ” detritus of nuclear weapons production : chemical sludge , lab gear and filters laced with tons of radioactive plutonium .
Nearly half a mile underground , workers push waste drums into crystalline labyrinths that seem as remote as the moon .
A faint salty haze glows in powdery beams from miners ’ headlamps and settles on the lips like a desert kiss .
Computer projections predict that within 1,000 years the ceilings and walls will collapse in a crushing embrace that seals the plutonium in place .
But plutonium remains deadly for 250 times that long -- an unsettling reminder that some of today ’s hazards will outlast the civilizations that created them .
The “ forever problem , ” unique to the modern technological age , has made crafting the user manual for this toxic tomb the final daunting task in an already monumental project .
The result is a gargantuan system that borrows elements equally from Stonehenge and “ Star Trek . ”

Communicating danger may seem relatively straightforward , but countless human efforts to bridge the ages have failed as societies fall , languages die and words once poetic or portentous become the indecipherable marks of a long - forgotten scribbler .
To future generations , warnings about Nelson ’s dump may seem as impenetrable as the 600 - year - old “ Canterbury Tales ” are for all but a few scholars today .
“ No culture has ever tried , self - consciously and scientifically , to design a symbol that would last 10,000 years and still be intelligible , ” said David B. Givens , an anthropologist who helped plan the nuclear - site warnings .
“ And even if we succeed , would the message be believed ? ”
The Energy Department predicted such a problem when it began planning for the $ 9 - billion waste dump , dubbed WIPP , in 1974 and for a similar repository in Nevada at Yucca Mountain , near Las Vegas .
That site has not yet been opened .
Eventually it will store highly radioactive spent fuel from nuclear power plants as well as high - level waste from the weapons program .

Trying to communicate across 500 generations posed an unprecedented challenge of linguistics , semiotics and materials science , so the government first asked scientists , futurists and historians to envision what the far - distant future might be like .
Their report combines dry analysis and projections worthy of sci - fi disaster films , including massive climate change and feminist corporations that disbelieve WIPP warnings because they were written by men .
Civilization is so interdependent and fragile , one panelist grimly noted , “ that any massive global catastrophe might lead to reversion to at least a preindustrial era . ”
Greed or desperation could give rise to legends that WIPP holds buried treasure -- apparently confirmed by surface warnings to keep out .
In a sense , they ’re right .
Oil and gas deposits lie thousands of feet below the plant .
In 100 or 5,000 years , an energy - poor government , company or gasoline - addicted tribe in a ruined society , like those depicted in the film “ The Road Warrior , ” could adopt a “ drill first , ask questions later ” policy -- piercing the repository and pulling death to the surface .
Others predicted the invention of self - guided robotic “ mole miners ” that would penetrate the site from the side or below .
In a scenario set in the year 11991 , robotic slaves are infected with a computer virus that compels them to override their safety programming as they compulsively drill and construct mine shafts .

Opportunities for WIPP to fail , the experts agreed , are limited only by the imagination .
The government formed a separate panel of scientists , linguists and artists to create a warning scheme to counter the pessimistic projections .
That group immediately rejected digital or paper records -- only a solution cast in stone could hope to solve a problem for the ages .
If Egyptian pyramids have lasted more than 5,000 years , today ’s monuments should fare better -- if built from prosaic materials , such as ultra - hard concrete .
Scavengers stripped the pyramids bare for their once - shimmering marble skins .
The trefoil symbol for radioactive material might seem a natural alternative to text , but experts doubt that it will be understood by future societies any better than today ’s English .
Consider the swastika , first used on pottery by European tribes in 4000 BC .
It was adopted by ancient Troy and later became a holy icon of Hinduism .
When the Nazis claimed it , the symbol became widely reviled .

The panelists also considered the plaque on the 1972 Pioneer space probe , now headed for deep space .
It pictures a nude man and woman , a schematic drawing of the craft escaping our solar system and a basic interstellar map .
They soon rejected it as a model , said Jon Lomberg , an artist who designed the plaque with the late astronomer Carl Sagan .
“ You ’d think it would be easier to communicate with humans ” than extraterrestrials , he said .
“ But the [ Pioneer ] spacecraft will never land , so it ’s only going to be found by some highly developed technological culture .
All we can guess about the future inhabitants of the area near WIPP is that they are human -- unless they are cyborgs ....
Once you have people with augmented brains or genetically engineered minds with enhanced perceptions , you ca n’t be sure how human they will be . ”
There are at least two universally understood pictographic forms .
The human stick figure has survived nearly unchanged from Stone Age cave drawings to the doors of modern public restrooms .
And the sequential panel , or comic strip , was developed independently by ancient Egyptians , American Indians and medieval Japanese .
They also are far from foolproof .
The South Africa Chamber of Mines learned this when it used a simple picture sequence to train illiterate miners to clear rocks from mine tracks .
Instead of improving , the rock problem worsened .

“ Miners were indeed reading the message , but from right to left , ” said Lomberg , a former WIPP advisor .
“ They obligingly dumped their rocks on the tracks . ”
Nelson considers such concerns far - fetched , citing 30,000 - year - old cave drawings .
“ I understand those cave drawings and I do n’t speak Neanderthal ....
He ’s killing a bison , ‘ bison -- food ! ’
I can do pictographs just as well , ” he said .
“ I can convey an absolute sense of danger . ”
Yet the same Stone Age caves contain markings and handprints whose meaning remains obscure .
Advertisement
“ The scribbles , we have no idea what they are ....
The handprints -- is that the artist ’s signature ? ” Lomberg said .
“ We do n’t know .
Of course the big difference is that these were not intended as messages to the future -- so far as we can tell . ”
With so many ways to fail , WIPP ’s planners opted for the classic American approach :
Think big and leave no stone unturned .
The plan will take more than a century to implement .
To grasp the scale of the warnings , start with the Great Pyramid in Egypt , built from more than 6.5 million tons of stone covering 13 acres .
Multiply that mass by five , and you have the first warning layer : a 98 - foot - wide , 33 - foot - tall , 2 - mile - long berm surrounding the site .
That ’s just to get the attention of anyone who happens by .
“ Size equates with importance .
The bigger the animal the more that animal is to be reckoned with , ” Givens said .

Powerful magnets and radar reflectors would be buried inside the berm so that remote sensors could recognize the site as purposefully and elaborately designed .
It would be surrounded by 48 granite or concrete markers , 32 outside the berm and 16 inside , each 25 feet high and weighing 105 tons , engraved with warnings in English , Spanish , Russian , French , Chinese , Arabic and Navajo , with room for future discoverers to add warnings in contemporary languages .
Pictures would denote buried hazards and human faces of horror and revulsion .
The same symbols would be printed on metal , plastic and ceramic disks with abrasion - resistant coatings , 9 inches in diameter , that would be buried just below the surface .
Three information rooms would archive detailed drawings of WIPP ’s chambers and the physics of its hazards on stone tablets .
They would also provide a world map showing all other known waste repositories and a star chart to calculate the year the site was sealed .

One such room would stand in the center of the site .
Another would be buried inside the berm , its only entrance a 2 - foot hole to inhibit theft of the tablets , sealed with a 1,600 - pound stone plug .
The third room would be off site -- perhaps inside the nearby Carlsbad Caverns .
The final thing WIPP needs is a kind of Rosetta stone , a pictorial dictionary to aid in translation .
The markers will take decades to build and test , to help ensure they stand the test of time .
But there ’s no hurry .
WIPP wo n’t be full until 2033 .
It would then be guarded by the Energy Department for 100 years until it is abandoned ; no one who designed the markers would be alive to see them succeed for even a single day .
Inspired by so long a view , one of the site ’s expert panels , in an epigraph to its report , quoted Rabbi Tarfon , a Jewish sage who lived 1,900 years ago :
Advertisement
“ You are not obliged to finish the task , nor are you released from undertaking it . ”
Once the vault is locked , some of WIPP ’s advisors want the site left unmarked because any warnings would draw only more attention , they say .
Warnings , they argue , would be misunderstood or dismissed , the same way ancient grave robbers ignored curses inscribed on the tombs of Egyptian pharaohs to seize the riches inside .
Leave it bare , they contend , and the site will melt unseen into the harsh New Mexico desert .
“ Any monument would become a tourist attraction , ” said Gregory Benford , a UC Irvine physicist and former WIPP advisor .
“ People come ; they need hotels .
Hotels need water .
They drill for water and break into the vault .
‘ No marker ’ is a strategy , but people regard it as immoral . ”

Such views reflect WIPP ’s one certainty :
No one knows what will happen far in the future .
“ I have to assume that the divine creator is going to take care of most of this stuff , ” said Steve Casey , the WIPP engineer charged with overseeing construction of the warning system .
“ No matter what confounded thing we come up with , all it takes is one catastrophic event and it ’s gone . ”
That so much time and effort are spent even thinking about how to warn future generations reflects a significant shift in nuclear attitudes .
The past still can be glimpsed a short drive from WIPP at a site where an atomic warhead was detonated 1,151 feet underground in 1961 .
Two corroded plaques glued to a 4 - foot concrete slab commemorate the test , dubbed Project Gnome .
The monument has been nudged several yards over the decades by cattle that use it as a rubbing post .
Spent rifle shells crunch underfoot ; the pockmarked shrine is favored by locals for target practice .

A third plaque was pried off , perhaps as a souvenir .
According to earlier visitors , it read , in plain English , “ This site will remain dangerous for 24,000 years . ”
Beneath fast - moving sections of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet [ image ] , the continent 's own natural plumbing system fills and empties a network of previously unknown subsurface lakes with surprising speed , a new study suggests .
The movement of water through the lakes might influence the flow of ice streams , which are meandering sections of the ice sheet that move faster than the surrounding ice .
Further research into the phenomenon could help scientists understand how the frozen continent contributes to sea level rise .
While scientists previously have identified at least 145 subglacial lakes under the Antarctic ice sheet , this new system is notable because it occurs under fast - moving glaciers , the Whillans and Mercer Ice Streams , which carry ice from the interior to the Ross Ice Shelf on the west coast , and ultimately out to the ocean .
" We 've found that there are substantial subglacial lakes under ice that 's moving a couple of meters [ yards ] per day , " said Robert Bindschadler of NASA Goddard Space Flight Center , one of the study 's coauthors .
" It 's really ripping along . "
These subglacial lakes are basins that lie between the ice and the underlying bedrock .
In this region , the amount of water under the ice and its rapid movement were unexpected .
" We did n't realize that the water under these ice streams was moving in such large quantities and on such short time scales , " lead author Helen Fricker said .
" We thought these changes took place over years and decades , but we are seeing large changes over months . "
About 2 cubic kilometers of water ( that 's about 5 gallons for each person in the United States every day for a year ) drained in just three years from a previously unknown subglacial lake identified in the study , published today in the online version of the journal Science .
Satellite lasers were used to detect height differences in the surface ice [ image ] that revealed the apparent movement of the underground water system .
The water is heavily pressurized by the overlying ice , which can be up to 1 kilometer ( a little over half a mile ) thick , so when the water moves , it raises and lowers the ice above [ video ] .
When water is pooling in a lake , it pushes up on the ice above , but when the lake empties , the ice above depresses .
The elevation changes measured in the study were as much as 9 meters , or about the height of a 3 - story building , according to Fricker .
" What we 're seeing is changes on the surface which are reflecting what 's happening at the bed due to the water under pressure at the bed moving from one part of the drainage system to another , " Fricker said in a press conference .
It 's unknown how exactly the water drains from the lakes .
The researchers suspect it could drain from one or several channels in the ice or through subglacial till , or coarse sediment .
The discovery of the rapidly changing underground lakes is important because water beneath the ice bed could act as a lubricant and change the flow of the ice streams above .
Whether that is the case under these ice streams is uncertain -- there is evidence that the ice stream is actually slowing down despite an increase in the amount of water under the ice .
And understanding how the underlying water affects the movements of these streams is critical to predicting how the ice will respond to global warming and contribute to sea level rise as it steadily lurches toward the ocean .
" It 's the fast - moving ice , " Bindschadler said , " that determines how the ice sheet responds to climate change on a short timescale . "
There are no solutions yet to longstanding problems like who — the American forces , or the Iraqis ’ own anemic logistics system — will supply the fuel required to keep Iraqi Humvees and troop - carrying trucks running , at a time when the American supply chain will face new strains in supporting thousands of additional American troops .

The plan gives a central role to the National Police , viewed as widely infiltrated by Shiite militias and , despite an intensive American retraining program , still suspected of a strongly Shiite sectarian bias .
One American officer said that the National Police commanders have been “ dragging their feet ” over their role in the new plan and that they could seriously compromise the operation .
Against those concerns , American officers cite several factors they believe will lend impetus to the new offensive .
The five additional brigades of American troops committed by President Bush — approximately 21,500 American soldiers , about 80 percent of them to be deployed in Baghdad — will roughly triple the numbers of American soldiers available for ground operations , as a relatively small proportion of the new troop strength will be needed for “ force protection , ” the military term for troops who safeguard bases and ensure the safety of other soldiers .
Since the resignation of former Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld after the November elections , American commanders here have been more candid in acknowledging something Mr. Rumsfeld often disputed : that the commanders have had to play shell games with thinly stretched troops , and that many crucial operations , including previous attempts to secure Baghdad , have failed because troops have often been moved on to other operations , allowing insurgents and militia groups to retake areas vacated by the Americans .
The new plan , the Americans say , will go a long way toward redressing that problem , at least in Baghdad .
Another positive cited by American officers is the appointment by President Bush of Lt. Gen. David H. Petraeus as the new overall American commander in Iraq , succeeding Gen. George W. Casey Jr. , who will leave next month after more 30 months in command of the war .
General Petraeus , who has already completed two 12 - month tours in Iraq , has a reputation among officers who have served under him as an imaginative commander who enlists strong loyalties among his troops .
Many officers interviewed for this article said they still believed the tide of the war here can be reversed , with the additional troops , the focus on regaining control of Baghdad and the more consistent military strategy they said they expected from General Petraeus .
The 54 - year - old native of upstate New York , a marathon runner , will come to Baghdad after overseeing the Army ’s reworking of its counterinsurgency manual , parts of which he redrafted himself .
American officials in Baghdad and Washington have said that they have limited time — perhaps no more than six to nine months — to show gains from the new American push before popular support erodes still further and the onset of the 2008 presidential campaign leads American politicians to push harder for a troop withdrawal .
There are also questions of how long the overstretched American military can sustain the stepped - up presence here .
Administration officials say their approach was carefully calibrated to focus on concerns that Iran is providing potent weapons used against American troops in Iraq , not to ignite a wider war .
“ We ’re trying to strike the right tone here , ” a senior administration official said Monday .
“ It would have raised the rhetoric to major decibel levels if we had had a briefing in Washington . ”
At the State Department , the Pentagon and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence , officials had anticipated resistance to their claims .
They settled on an approach that sidelined senior officials including Zalmay Khalilzad , the American ambassador to Iraq , and John D. Negroponte , who until last week was the director of national intelligence .
By doing so , they avoided the inevitable comparisons to the since - discredited presentation that Secretary of State Colin L. Powell made to the United Nations Security Council in 2003 asserting that Iraq had illicit weapons .
The White House and the State Department both made clear on Monday that they endorsed the findings presented in Baghdad .
Asked for direct evidence linking Iran ’s leadership to the weapons , Tony Snow , the White House spokesman , said : “ Let me put it this way .
There ’s not a whole lot of freelancing in the Iranian government , especially when its comes to something like that . ”
Sean McCormack , the State Department spokesman , said : “ While they presented a circumstantial case , I would put to you that it was a very strong circumstantial case .
The Iranians are up to their eyeballs in this activity , I think , very clearly based on the information that was provided over the weekend in Baghdad . ”
In Australia , however , Gen. Peter Pace , the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , told reporters that he “ would not say ” that Iran ’s leadership was aware of or condoned the attacks .
“ It is clear that Iranians are involved , and it ’s clear that materials from Iran are involved , but I would not say by what I know that the Iranian government clearly knows or is complicit , ” according to an account posted on the Voice of America Web site .
I was 8 years old when my sister was born .
The length of my mother 's pregnancy she would repeat how she was carrying her differently than she had carried me and that she was certain that it was going to be a boy .
Different friends and family members would remark on the shape and location of my mother 's belly , declaring the same .
At 8 years old , when someone tells you something with the certainty that an adult can do , you tend to believe it .
I geared myself up for having a brother .
I drew pictures dedicated to my future brother , " Alex . " I was as excited as an impending big sister can be .
I distinctly remember sitting in the corridor of the hospital with my grandfather , the sound of his keys jingling in his fidgeting hand , when my dad approached our bench with a huge smile on his face .
" Congratulations , Zara ! " he beamed .
" You have a brand new baby sister ! "
My face was blank for a few beats before I replied .
" But ... where 's my brother ? "
As life went on , the surprises did n't stop there .
Adjusting to having a new baby in the home when you 've been the only child is n't easy for anyone .
I went from being the center of attention , doted on by both of my parents to being that weird little kid that people barely acknowledged before cooing over the infant in the stroller .
My dad began to work more , one of those side effects rarely spoken of about men who become fathers to multiple children .
" Provider Anxiety Syndrome , " I like to call it .
I did not deal with the situation well .
When my sister would cry in the car , I would bop my hand over her wailing mouth , delighting in the Indian battle cry that it would produce .
Listening to my mom and dad yell at me about my antics would just propel me to want to do more .
I would hide her favorite toys and claim ignorance to their disappearance .
Her beloved " blankie " would often find itself crammed into the back corner of the linen closet , unable to heed her cries .
I started spending more time in my room , reading books , writing stories of heroines in peril , ignored and abused by uncaring family .
I do n't really recall the exact time when my sister started to change .
She was a smiling baby , chubby cheeks wrinkling up whenever she 'd greet playmates with a gummy smile .
My mother recalls thinking that she was just a " different " child than I was , but the suspicions of anything deeper than that were not investigated .
Around home , she was as normal as any other weird member of our family .
Her large motor skills were slightly behind for her age , but not to such a significant degree that anyone caught on or paid it any notice .
My mom got pregnant again around the time that she turned 2 .
After losing so much of the attention that I had previously grown to depend upon , it was like hearing a dull thud in my ears the evening that I was delivered the news .
My sister gurgled away in her high chair , throwing food on the floor as my mom served me a plate of Kraft Macaroni and Cheese .
I knew something was up when my health conscious mother was allowing me to eat processed food .
I slid the tube shaped noodles onto the tines of my fork and grunted a response as a way of acknowledging that I 'd heard her .
By the time that my second baby sister was born , I 'd grown as used to not being the apple of my parents ' eye as a kid could get .
I was 11 by then , firmly three quarters of the way through puberty , my worries now firmly centered on myself and only myself , as is normal for preteens .
It was easier dealing with my baby sister .
She was bubbly and thankfully " normal . "
As a form of retaliation towards my first sister , I spent more time doting on my baby sister .
I was a kid at the time , not quite aware of what my actions meant .
Looking back , I understand them now .
At the time it was just a subtle way of continuing my mean streak toward the little person that my young mind perceived as having ruined my easy ride .
When my sister entered kindergarten , my mom started to get the calls .
The teacher began to report that she was " different " than the other kids .
My mother did n't understand why they were making such a big deal over what she thought were just personality tics .
At home my sister was as she had always been .
It was n't until my mom observed her in the classroom that she began to wonder if the teachers were right .
First grade was hellish for my sister .
Out of all of the teachers that she 's had over the years , it is the teacher from first grade that she recalls as being the worst .
Forcing her to do things as the other kids in the class were supposed to do them , with very little understanding or recognition of the fact that she might be different , the teacher made my sister feel ostracized from the rest of her classmates .
Around this time was when my sister first became a target for the school bully as well .
Stalked around the playground and taunted with comments about her weight , the tormenting went on for a couple of years and has stuck with her ever since .
When second grade came around , my sister was blessed with a more understanding teacher .
The woman had previously been a Special Education teacher and after spending time with my sister was able to recognize some of the habits that are associated with autism .
My sister remembers her fondly as being soft - spoken , kind and understanding .
She helped to walk my mother through an uncertain time , getting the school psychologist to sit down with my family and discuss a possible diagnosis .
It was at that time determined that my sister was either schizophrenic or autistic .
Her large motor skills were still behind and she was enrolled in physical therapy to help her catch up .
The two sides of her body were not in sync and when she would jump her feet would lift off the floor and return to it at two different times .
She remained in therapy for a couple of years until her body had progressed to meet the level of other children her age .
I was in high school by the time that this was happening , more concerned with boyfriends and school functions than what my weird little sister was going through .
I despised needing to wait on my mom to take her to appointments when I wanted a ride to the mall to hang out with my friends .
I quickly picked up on dating guys that were older than me , the ones who had licenses and drove cars .
While my mother did n't admit it at the time , I feel she was more permissive of this because it lightened her load and she was able to avoid my bratty outbursts as long as there was someone else to chauffer me around .
Being a teenager is the time of being self - absorbed .
I never really understood what was going on at the time with my sister , nor did I fully appreciate what my parents were going through .
As a parent now myself , I have a great deal of respect for my mother for holding her shit together with me as well as she did .
As I asked her questions recently about what that time in her life was like , it became apparent to me the sacrifices that we make as mothers and fathers .
The whispered voices that quiet when you walk into a room .
The social interaction that you lose .
My mother is an eighth grade English teacher .
By the time that my sister was in school , enrolled in the same district that my mother taught in , her name and reputation as a teacher was established .
Looking back on the time when my sister was first being diagnosed , she recalls the invasive questions that the school asked .
The feeling of being put through the third degree , that the doctors and the teachers were looking for something , anything to pin the autism on .
With a hint of anger she recalls the feeling that they were insinuating that if only she was a better parent , a better teacher , a better person , this would n't be happening with her child .
Those feelings carried over into her professional life .
She describes that there became this shadow of doubt cast over her in the school system .
Talking done behind closed doors and behind her back that she must not be as good of a teacher if she could n't control her own child .
She speaks of feeling like people purposefully distanced themselves from her , like people tend to act around cancer patients .
" It 's as if people feel that it 's ' catching , ' " she said to me .
" Or that they 'll have to deal with a person being emotional .
That they might have to see you cry or become upset and just do n't want to have to deal with that . "
There is a slight hint of bitterness in her voice as she tells me this , explaining how she feels that she lost intimacy with former friendships during this time .
Because of the large gap in our ages , I had graduated from high school before my sister had even exited grade school .
After spending a year in college , I went into the workplace on a more full time basis , scheduling the Thursdays that my sisters had half - days at school to be off so that I could help my mother in picking them up .
At that time it was still easier to relate to my baby sister .
Not realizing at the time that I was still heavily favoring her , I planned outings with her , taking her to lunch , the movies , the mall .
It was easier to not put much thought into my sister , my weird sister .
I guess I still felt like she received extra attention from my parents , so why bother giving her more from me .
Around the time that she was in the third grade , she 'd been prescribed medication to help keep her symptoms on track .
One of the biggest ones was the most common in autism patients .
She would fixate on a certain thing , becoming overwhelmingly preoccupied with it .
Throughout grade school that thing was dinosaurs .
Everything she touched throughout her day had to be dinosaur associated .
Dinosaur plates and cups , dinosaur bed sheets and blankets , dinosaur toothbrushes , toys and books .
As long as she stayed on her routine , took her meds and no one screwed with her things , she could function fine .
When she entered junior high school , my sister 's doctor suggested slowly taking her off her medication .
( She 'd taken Haldol and Cylert among others . )
Seeing that she was doing fine without it , she was taken off drugs at that time completely .
She has n't been on any prescriptions since then .
It was also around that time that she started to feel like she was being repressed in school .
The special education programs , while designed well to handle children with developmental disabilities and the repetitive habits and strange natures , is n't geared toward a great deal of intellectual advancement .
My sister wanted to branch out more into regular classes , especially in high school where she began to excel at art .
This was her area of expertise , where her disability was more of a benefit than a restriction .
However , because she was never fully prepared in the special education courses to handle anything on a higher learning level , many of the other regular classes that she attempted were difficult for her , even despite her strong desire to want to succeed in them .
It was toward the end of her junior high school career that the doctors finally properly diagnosed her disability as well .
It was determined that she had Asperger 's Disorder , a high - functioning version of autism contained under the Autism Spectrum Disorder ( sometimes referred to as Pervasive Developmental Disorder or PDD ) .
With a better understanding of what she was dealing with , my mother was able to do more research and start to fully comprehend what was " wrong " with her child .
Some of the benchmarks of Asperger 's include severe impairment of social interaction skills .
People with the disorder have impaired non-verbal behaviors such as being unable to make eye contact when talking to another person , having a lack of proper facial expressions ( their faces look impassive or on the opposite end of the spectrum they might always smile , even when angry or sad ) , strange body movements or positions of their limbs and using wild or unusual gestures to communicate .
We learned that her obsession with dinosaurs was also completely the norm for an Asperger 's patient .
Other individuals with Asperger 's would display similar behaviors , including sharing her inflexibility when it came to changing routine .
Repetitive motions like finger tapping , a rocking of the body , or in my sister 's case , slowing pulling out hairs on her forearms were also considered normal for her condition .
The upside to finding out that it was Asperger 's and not the general form of autism was that she was n't going to suffer from language impediments , delays in cognitive reasoning or social adaption skills .
She was going to have a better chance of learning habits of other NTs ( " Neuro - typicals , " or what Asperger 's patients tend to refer to us " normal " people as ) out in the world .
In simpler terms , all hope was not lost .
I was 21 when I first moved out of my parent 's home .
Living on my own was the shocking experience that it is for most young people .
Figuring out how to balance expenses , learning to be responsible for laundry , cooking and cleaning , all of those luxuries that we take for granted when our moms and dads are assisting us with .
It was in that time of learning to adapt and survive on my own that I began to miss my family , weird little sister and all .
In those years I attempted to understand more , and I tried reaching out and doing that bonding that I 'd previously avoided .
One summer I signed my sister and I up to be volunteers at the local Humane Society .
It involved picking her up from my parent 's home one afternoon a week , driving into the neighboring city of Ojai , located a 20 minute leisurely drive away .
In that time , she blossomed in front of me .
With each progressive week she opened up more , eventually getting to a point where she dominated our conversations .
I listened in amazement , surprised at how she 'd grown , wondering how long I 'd missed out on being a more interactive part of her life .
If there 's ever been a moment in my life where I came close to feeling regret , it was during those drives .
That feeling soon turned to a feeling of gratitude .
While I worried about what I 'd missed , one evening my mom called me and gave me the most beautiful bit of information that I think I 've ever received .
She told me of how my sister jabbered excitedly one evening at dinner after one of our afternoons .
" I like Zara so much better now that she does n't live with us , " she told my mom .
There has never been a more backhanded compliment that has meant as much to me as that one .
There was a desire to beat myself up over all the times I pushed her out of my room and out of my life when I was an ornery teenager .
A feeling that I needed to be sorry that I could n't have been more understanding for my age .
But without all of those moments , all of those completely understandable developmental stages in my adolescent development , I would have missed the bonding that we did in the later years .
Without all of the bullshit , there would n't have been a recognition of the beauty that our relationship eventually grew into .
As an adult my sister has become an advocate for understanding .
With the proliferation of internet users these days , information at the fingertips of even the most uneducated , there are a lot of ideas floating around to be absorbed by the easily lead .
Sometimes it's not just that people are stupid , ignorant or easily lead as I might refer to them as being .
Sometimes they 're just frustrated parents , much like my mother was back in the days that my sister was initially being diagnosed .
When everyone is trying to pin the blame on you , I can see how they would go looking for someone else to pass that along to .
My mother 's hairdresser has a 14 year old son who suffers from the more classic variation of autism .
She is among the group of parents who believe that vaccinations are to blame for her son 's disability .
Seeing a child that was on a normal developmental track up until the age of 2 when he was given the standard battery of shots that are administered by pediatricians , she genuinely believes that he was negatively affected by them .
While I can empathize with her frustration , I also know that autism can still be undiagnosed up until the age of three , and in my sister 's case even later .
It all comes around to that lack of understanding that we have for the parents of children with disabilities .
The age - old argument of " until you 've been there , you do n't really know what I 'm going through . "
That is true enough , but with 1 in 150 children now being diagnosed with some form of autism , the time is going to need to come when we can stop judging this disability as being something preventable .
This is not Fetal Alcohol Syndrome , a disability put onto children by a mother 's excessive alcoholism .
This is a bio-neurological disorder which knows not race , nor religion , nor region , nor socio-economic status .
In a phrase : IT IS NO ONE'S " FAULT . "
As I set out to tell the tale of my sister , I did the internet route .
I googled the term " Asperger 's Autism . "
I found several websites devoted to " curing " and / or " ending " autism .
They are visible , they are funded , they are supported .
There are organizations like Athletes Against Autism , founded by three NHL players and fathers of autistic children .
There is information on how to " prevent " symptoms from occurring and statements meant to foster hope , like explaining that Asperger 's has a " more positive outcome " than standard high - functioning autism .
I even discovered that President Bush recently signed a bill entitled the " Combating Autism Act of 2006 ( s.843 ) " in which almost $ 1 billion will be dedicated over the next five years to research , screening and early detection of autism and autism spectrum disorders like Asperger's .
The bill is supported by Republicans and Democrats alike , from Congressmen to Senators .
I found much of the information overwhelmingly negative , for all of the positive spin that they tried to put on it .
Using such terms as " curing , " " combating , " and even " against , " made me cringe .
Have we really become a nation where rather than learn to adapt to changes within our environment we have to attack them and eradicate them in order to feel safe at night ?
Are people like my sister really all that scary of a concept for the world at large to try and deal with ?
I took a walk with my sister this afternoon , listening to her drone on about video games ( one of her more recent obsessions ) and thought to myself how much I like her as a person .
I love my sister with all of my heart because she is my sister , but it is a major distinction to be able to say that I like her as another human being .
She is passionate , caring , loving and understanding .
All of this might be hard to read at times , especially if you do n't know her on a personal level , but she has this strength within her that very few people possess .
Much of that I have been privy to as I became a mother and in turn made her an aunt .
When Midget was a baby , my sister wanted nothing to do with her .
One afternoon while my family was babysitting her as a favor to me while I was at work , she was handed an infant Midget and told to hold her while my mom fetched something .
Midget began to fuss and my sister panicked and decided she would put her down on the blanket stretched across the carpet .
Only she did n't lower her down enough , so the dull thud as she dropped the last couple of inches to the floor caused her to begin to wail .
When I returned to retrieve her in the evening , I was told of this incident and greeted with my sister 's profuse explanations .
" I thought she was low enough , " " they should n't have given her to me , " and " you know how I hate babies ! ! " were all on the slate that night .
I was n't angry and there was no harm done .
I had to calm my sister down more than Midget had needed calming at the time that she was dropped .
" Do you think she 'll remember ? " my sister added on at the end .
I reassured her that she would n't , but over the next year she made a point of avoiding any possible baby responsibilities .
One afternoon , around the time that Midget was a year and a half old , she wandered into my sister 's bedroom where she was blaring music out of her stereo and reading while reclined on her bed .
Entranced by the beat , a toddler Midget began to bounce up and down and clap her hands .
I did n't realize it then , but at that moment the tide was forever turned .
Looking at her young niece , my sister later related to me that she was " kinda cool .... for a baby . "
Since that day , my sister has gone above and beyond as an aunt .
Far more patient than other individuals her age , she will spend hours teaching my daughter how to draw animals , demonstrating techniques that she 's learned in art class .
She offers to watch movies with her , go on walks with her and generally is the person that my daughter refers to as being her " favorite aunt . "
For all of the claims about people with autism being closed off from interpersonal affection , my sister has found a way to express her love for Midget .
While there are few hugs , there are always generous birthday and Xmas presents , time spent teaching and lessons learned in understanding .
Even the obsessive nature that is seen as a detriment in the symptoms of autism is a winning feature in the eyes of child .
( And subsequently in the eyes of that child 's mother . )
My sister 's insane love of Halloween has brought us years of complementary costumes , from Little Red Riding Hood and the Big Bad Wolf to Daphne and Scooby Doo .
How anyone could attribute that preoccupation ( one week after Halloween ' 06 was over , my sister was ready to plan the next set of costumes ) as something negative is beyond comprehension to me .
I 've often tried to explain my sister and my relationship with her to other people , often times greeted with a polite but unknowing smile .
There is almost a hush over the autistic community , what with all of the information readily available trying to train you that the symptoms of autism can be stifled , overcome , " cured . "
In an attempt to protect themselves , many of the online communities that share stories of what life is like living with Asperger 's keep certain entries private , visible to only the community 's members and not the internet readers at large .
I discussed with my sister whether or not I could share her name or her picture and even she cringed when trying to decide whether or not she was OK with that .
It is a rough thing to deal with , knowing that there will be a strong backlash against her , one of those who feels as if there is nothing to " cure . "
She tried to describe her emotions to me about this , explaining that she often feels " paranoid " when she hears people speak in different languages or hushed tones around her .
She assumes that they are talking about her and that makes her very " emotional .
And I can't control my emotions very well .
I 'll start crying and I can't stop and people get weirded out by that . "
She started to tear up while explaining this to me , dabbing away at her eyes with the neck of her t- shirt .
" My tears betray my emotions , " she continued .
" It 's very frustrating . "
I joked with her that it was frustrating to live with her at times as well .
There are moments when in a conversation with her where you can tell that she just turned the tape on in her head .
That obsessive nature again at work , the words spilling out of her mouth are a set of pre-recorded bits of information that she 's logged away , ready to share .
You can interrupt her when she 's in the middle of it and watch her expression .
She stops talking because that is the socially acceptable thing to do , but looking into her eyes you know that all she 's really done is put that tape on pause .
As soon as you are done adding your piece , the tape player kicks back in , right at the place she left off .
It 's a feature of hers that I 've learned to live with and even grown a certain degree of awe over .
It is the easiest way for me to explain that she just is who she is , Asperger 's being just a feature of that , much like a " normal " person might be described as being " outgoing , " " talkative , " or even outright " obnoxious . "
It is what makes her who she is , that being my sister , my daughter 's favorite aunt and my friend .
When I asked her to tell me what the hardest part about being autistic was , I was greeted with a response that I was prepared to get .
" Ummm .... " she began to droll while I waited patiently .
Finally she looked over at me and threw her hands up .
" I 'm not good with those things , you know ? " she finished with a short chortle .
Yeah , I know .

For the last couple of weeks I have been working on a little side project called Tercio .
Its meant to be a webapp server for Erlang .
Erlang , however , presents a few twists that a web app system should take into account .
The two major aspects that need to be integrated are concurrency and OTP .
With a bit of thought you can create a system that makes use of concurrency and allows for the use of OTP .
However , I did n't want to do that .
I want to create a system that is intrinsically entwined with concurrency and requires OTP for its best use .
This takes a bit more thought .
In the end though I came up with what I think is a good approach .
That is to create a ' safe ' bridge into an OTP system from javascript .
This would allow to send messages from the client into the server and receive messages back .
This is n't a new idea .
Guillaume Germain created something similar in Termite .
However , I do n't think anyone has made it simple , performant and scalable .
Which is what I am trying to do .
Fortunately I am pretty far along .
I have written a very usable configuration system called tconfig .
For configuring tercio .
I have also built in a pretty basic but working http server for use during development .
This system is based off of the trap exit howto " A fast web server demonstrating some undocumented Erlang features " .
It 's called ' carre ' and built into the tercio system .
Its not the only way to serve tercio apps but its by far the easiest .
The configuration and briding systems are built of a custom , fast implementation of a json parser thats just a bit more lenient on input then the currently available one .
It also can't parse chunked data , but there is always a trade off .
To make message passing between the client and server just a bit more interesting I am integrating the really ingenious narrativejs into the system .
Its written in javascript , but through the power of gcj and rhino I have a native executable that erlang can make use of just fine .
I am just finishing up the erlang / javascript bridge parts of tercio .
Once thats complete I will be able to start building up some really interesting stuff .
ADAPTIVE SOFTWARE

The Problem With Software
The problem with software is that it takes too much time and money to develop , and is brittle when used in situations for which it was not explicitly designed .
Various software design methodologies address this problem :
1970s : Structured Programming makes it feasible to build larger - scale software systems - provided you have a specification of the desired results at the start of the project and the specification rarely changed .
A typical application is a database report writing program which reads an input file and produces an output file .
We call this an input / output based application .

A typical application is a database report writing program which reads an input file and produces an output file .
We call this an based application .
1980s : Object - Oriented Programming makes it easier to reorganize when the specification changes , because functionality is split up into separate classes that are designed to have minimal interaction between them However , each change to the specification ( or to the environment ) still requires programmer intervention , with a costly redesign / reimplement / rebuild / retest cycle A typical application is a desktop publishing system , where user - initiated events ( mouse clicks , menu selections , etc. ) trigger computation .
We call this a user - initiated event based application .

Today : Adaptive Programming is aimed at the problem of producing applications that can readily adapt in the face of changing user needs , desires , and environment .
Adaptive software explicitly represent the actions that can be taken and the goals that the user is trying to achieve .
This makes it possible for the user to change goals without a need to rewrite the program .
A typical application is an information filter which searches the Internet or company intranet for information of personal interest to the reader .
Note that much of the searching may go on when the user is not even logged in .
The application does more on behalf of the user without constant interaction , and the sophistication comes from a splitting of responsibilities between the program and the user .
We call this an agent based application .
Of course , there have been other proposed methodologies for improving software .
Some address the problem of managing change , but only adaptive programming is about anticipating change and automatically dealing with it within a running program , without need of a programmer .
As a definition , we can say :
" Adaptive software uses available information about
changes in its environment to improve its behavior . "
The Challenge of Complex Environments
Software is expected to do more for us today , in more situations , than we ever expected in the past .
This is the challenge of complex environments .
The complexity comes from three dimensions .
First , there are more users .
Now everyone , not just trained professionals , uses software .
Second , there are more systems and more interactions among them .
A company that once had a homogeneous mainframe now has a wide variety of desktop , server , and mainframe machines , running a wide variety of protocols .
Third , there are more resources and goals .
Programmers are accustomed to trading off time versus space .
Now they also have to worry about bandwidth , security , money , completeness of results , quality of information , resolution of images and audio , and other factors , and they have to make the right trade - offs for a wide variety of users .
Together , these three dimensions make the designer 's job harder .
The designer can't foresee all the circumstances in which an application will be used , and thus can't always make the right design choices .
This can shorten a product 's lifetime , because upgrades will be needed for unforeseen situations , and it undermines the end user 's confidence that the product will even perform as advertised .
We can summarize the difficulties posed by complex environments with this table :
Standard Environment Complex Environment Certain Uncertain
All inputs observable Some inputs hidden Deterministic Non-deterministic Repeatable Unique
No other players Other players Static Dynamic Discrete Continuous Virtual world Real world
Five Myths of Traditional Software Development
Traditional software development is based on some principles which are no longer appropriate under this new world of complex environments .
It is worth looking at five of these myths .
The myth of the specification : Traditional software development assumes that the first task is to determine the specification , and all design and development follows after the specification is finalized .
More modern approaches stress spiral rapid development methods in which the specification is constantly being refined .
The target is really a combination of related components , not a single application .

The target is really a combination of related components , not a single application .
The myth of software maintenance :
The word " maintenance " gives the impression that the software has somehow degraded , and needs to be refurbished to its original condition .
This is misleading .
The bits in a program do not degrade .
They remain the same , while the environment around the program changes .
So it is really a process of upgrading or evolving to meet the needs of the changing environment .
By viewing it as a maintenance problem , one risks making the mistake of trying to preserve the old structure when its time has passed .

By viewing it as a maintenance problem , one risks making the mistake of trying to preserve the old structure when its time has passed .
The myth of the black box : Abstraction plays a crucial role in the development of reliable software .
However , treating a process as a black box with an input / output specification ignores the practical problem of resource usage .
When a system built out of these black boxes is too big or too slow , there is no way to improve the performance other than to tear the boxes apart .
Some work has been done on the idea of Open Implementation , in which modules have one interface for input / output behavior , and another orthogonal interface for performance tweaking .
Adaptive software adds to this by making the orthogonal interface a two way system ÷ there is a feedback loop that provides information on the results of the performance tweaking .

The myth of design choices :
In traditional software development , the designers consider several alternatives to implement each component , and then make choices based on the desired product .
The alternatives that were not chosen , along with the rationale for the choice , are then discarded .
That means when the environment changes ( perhaps a new communications protocol becomes popular , or the user gets a computer that is twice as powerful ) , one needs to start all over again to see what choices are now the best .
Often , the original programmers have moved on , and so their design rationale is lost .
The alternative is to capture the design criteria as a formal part of the program , and let the program reconfigure itself , as the environment changes , to optimally satisfy the criteria .

The myth of the expert programmer :
Most programmers have pride in their abilities , and feel they can always come up with a good solution , given a suitable specification of the problem .
In reality , programmers are only one resource available to a project , and an expensive resource at that .
Furthermore , it is impractical to ship a developer with each program ( except for very large and expensive custom applications ) .
This suggests that we find a tradeoff where the programmers and designers do what they can do best ÷ formally describe what the program is trying to do .
Then the program itself does the calculating and configuring necessary to achieve these goals in the current environment .
Key Technologies for Adaptive Software
Now we know what adaptive software does : it uses information from the environment to improve its behavior over time , as the program gains more experience .
And we know why it is difficult to do this : because specifications are incomplete and changing , because the environment is constantly changing , because carefully crafted designs may rely on assumptions that become obsolete , and because there is never as much programmer time as you really need .
In this section we survey some of the tools that help us overcome these difficulties .
Here are five of the most important :
Dynamic Programming Languages provide a robust framework for writing applications that persist over long lifetimes , and can be updated while they are running .
Agent Technology is a point of view that encompasses the idea of acting in accord to a user 's preferences .
Decision
Theory provides the basic terminology to talk about an uncertain world , and about what the preferred outcomes are .
Reinforcement Learning gives us a way to learn what sequence of actions to perform , given local results of the worth of individual actions .
Probabilistic
Networks provide powerful algorithms for computing optimal actions based on whatever is known about the current state of the world .
Static languages like C require the programmer to make a lot of decisions that nail down the structure of the program and the data it manipulates .
Dynamic languages like Dylan and CLOS ( Common Lisp Object System ) allow these decisions to be delayed , and thus provide a more responsive programming environment in the face of changing specifications .
Changes that would be too pervasive to even try in static languages can be easily explored with dynamic languages .
Dynamic languages provide the interfaces by which a program can change or extend its performance .
For example , in Dylan , a running program can add a method to an existing class without access to the original source code ; can define a brand new class or function under program control ; can debug another Dylan program , even one running remotely over the web .
All this makes it possible to build , re-build and modify complex programs using components .
Java is currently the most popular language with dynamic features , although it is not as thoroughly and elegantly dynamic as Dylan and CLOS .
There has been a lot of talk about software agents , and not much agreement on what they are .
The Oxford English Dictionary entry for " Agent " says : from Latin agere ( " to do " ) , 1 . One who acts or exerts power .
2 . He ... who produces an effect .
3 . Any natural force .
( e.g. a chemical agent ) .
4 . One who does the actual work - a deputy , substitute , representative .
So we see that essentially , an agent does something and optionally does it for someone .
Of course , all programs are intended to do something for someone .
Therefore , in order to make a distinction between " software agent " and just a " program , " we stress that software agents should be able to immediately respond to the preferences of their sponsors , and act according to those preferences .
In addition , we think of an agent as existing in a complex environment .
It can perceive part of the environment , and take some actions , but it does not have complete control over the environment .
In short , we want the agent to do the right thing , where " right thing " is defined by the user or users at that point .
There are three reasons why this is difficult :
You can't always get what you want :
In a complex environment , you generally can't optimize everything at once .
You can't have a program that is 100 % accurate , yet uses no resources and runs in no time .
So we need a way for the user to say which resources and results are most important , and which ones are less so .
: In a complex environment , you generally can't optimize everything at once .
You can't have a program that is 100 % accurate , yet uses no resources and runs in no time .
So we need a way for the user to say which resources and results are most important , and which ones are less so .
You never know what 's going to happen : Traditional programs are built with Boolean logic , which treats everything as " true " or " false . "
This is appropriate for the internal working of a digital computer , but out in the real world there are always going to be events about which we are uncertain .
For example , it is " likely " that we will be able to establish a given network connection , but we wo n't know for sure until we try .

For example , it is " likely " that we will be able to establish a given network connection , but we wo n't know for sure until we try .
You 're not the only one in the world :
There are other programs out there which can change the environment , and with which we can cooperate , contract , compete , and communicate .
Decision
Theory is the combination of utility theory ( a way of formally representing a user 's preferences ) and probability theory ( a way of representing uncertainty ) .
Decision
Theory is the cornerstone for designing proper adaptive software in an uncertain , changing environment .
It is " the " language for :
Describing adaptive software :
To respond to user preferences and deal with uncertainty , decision theory provides the only mathematically sound formalism to describe what it means to " do the right thing . "
: To respond to user preferences and deal with uncertainty , decision theory provides the only mathematically sound formalism to describe what it means to " do the right thing . "
Building adaptive software :
In some simple cases , once you 've done an analysis of a problem using decision theory , it becomes clear how to implement a solution using traditional methods .
But more often we need to use decision - theoretic technology like reinforcement learning or probabilistic .
Sometimes , a compilation step can be used , so that the run-time computational demands are minimal .

Communicating with agents :
What should a user say to a software agent ?
Or what would one software agent say to another ?
Most importantly , they should be able talk about what they want to happen , and so they need the language of utility theory .
But they also may want to talk about what they believe , and that requires probability theory .
Reinforcement Learning is a powerful technique to automatically learn a utility function , given only a representation of the possible actions and an immediate reward function - an indication of how well the program is doing on each step .
Given enough practice ( either in the real world or in a simulated environment ) , reinforcement learning is guaranteed to converge to an optimal policy .
Reinforcement Learning problems could in principle be solved exactly as a system of nonlinear equations , but in practice the problems are much too large for an exact solution , so we rely on an approximation technique based on dynamic programming .
As an example , consider assigning cellular phone calls to channels .
You want to use the available channels wisely so that there is no interference and a minimum of dropped calls .
Using reinforcement learning , Harlequin invented an algorithm that dynamically adapts to changes in calling patterns , and performs better than all existing published algorithms .
Reinforcement learning has been applied to other domains , such as flying an airplane , scheduling elevators , and controlling robots .
Probabilistic networks ( also known as Bayesian networks , Decision networks , and Influence diagrams ) are a way of representing a complex joint probability distribution as a graphical model of nodes ( representing random variables ) and arcs ( representing dependence between variables ) .
There are algorithms for determining the value of any variable , for learning qualitative and quantitative dependencies from data , for quantifying the sensitivity of an answer to uncertainties in the data , and for computing value of information : the worth of acquiring a new piece of information .
Side bar 1 : Industries and Applications for Adaptive Software
Here are some real - world applications of adaptive software undertaken by the Adaptive Systems Group at Harlequin :
Crime Pattern Analysis and Fraud Detection : Harlequin makes a data visualization tool for fraud and crime analysis called Watson .
For mid-size databases , trained users can easily navigate through the various displays to find the patterns they are looking for .
However , for larger databases we needed to add data mining techniques to help spot the patterns .
As new patterns in the data occur , we provide ways of visualizing them .
Financial : A credit card company wanted to be able to track purchase authorization requests , and decide which requests were likely to be from a stolen card , or were likely to be a credit risk .
Harlequin supplies the software upon which the authorization system is written .
The key for the customer was to have an efficient system capable of processing large volumes of transactions in real time , but still have a flexible system , where changes could be made in minutes , not days , with no need to bring the system down to install upgrades .
Manufacturing : A multinational company faced the problem of needing to continually build new versions of their product to meet new industry standard specifications .
Each test run of a new product variation costs about $ 10,000 .
Harlequin is actively consulting on this project to bring together all the prior test results and accumulated experience of the organization in one online tool , and to provide sophisticated statistical optimization techniques to recommend an optimal experimental test plan , based on past results and predicted future contingencies .
Electronic Publishing : Harlequin 's raster imaging processing software for high - end commercial printing is the fastest on the market .
But customers are interested in the speed of the total solution , so we are developing a dynamic workflow management system that will optimize the tracking and scheduling of the customer 's complete set of job tasks .
This requires monitoring the jobs and being able to predict how long each job will take at each processing stage .
Telecommunications : A telecommunications company wanted to build an experimental switching system for delivering video on demand to the home .
This requires strict real - time response ( 30 frames per second , no matter what ) , but it also requires flexibility in the software .
The customer required that they be able to add new functionality and even redefine existing functions while the switch is running , because it would not be acceptable to interrupt service .
Harlequin worked with the customer to meet these requirements using a real - time version of CLOS .
The result was a switching system that met all requirements , and was built with only 25 programmers , as compared to the 250 needed on the system it replaced .
A corresponding 10 - fold improvement was also seen in development costs and engineering change turn - around time .
Side bar 2 : Groups Working on Adaptive Software
Harlequin 's Adaptive Systems Group brings added value to Harlequin 's programming tools , web tools , and postscript printing software , and also offers consulting services for other companies .
Some of the projects are shown in the accompanying side bar .
Microsoft's Decision Theory and Adaptive Systems Group was started by several experts in decision theory ( David Heckerman , Jack Breese and Eric Horvitz ) , and was recently renamed to include " Adaptive Systems " in the title .
The group contributed the Print Troubleshooter in Windows 95 and the Answer Wizard in Microsoft Office .
The Symposium on Flexible Computation from the AAAI Fall Symposium dealt with " procedures that allow a graceful tradeoff to be made between the quality of results and allocations of costly resources , such as time , memory , or information .
Systems employing flexible computation gain the ability to adapt the quality of their response to dynamic changes in requirements . "
The Adaptive Intelligent Systems group run by Barbara Hayes - Roth at Stanford is investigating " systems that coordinate perception , reasoning , and action to pursue multiple goals while functioning autonomously in dynamic environments . "
The Demeter Group at Northeastern University says that " adaptations of the interactions of components can only be defined in terms of accumulated individual component adaptations .
New techniques are starting to provide higher levels of abstractions for adaptability .
Software architecting brings system level abstractions .
The Adaptive Software family of languages allows this higher abstraction at the programming level . "
The Open Implementation project at Xerox PARC provides the basis of the black box metaphor used in this paper .
Xerox 's Aspect Oriented Programming project goes one step further .
" AOP works by allowing programmers to first express each of a system 's aspects of concern in a separate and natural form , and then automatically combine those separate descriptions into a final executable form using a tool called an Aspect Weaver™ . "
The GMD's ( German equivalent of NSF ) Adaptive Systems Research Group deals with statistical learning and with adaptive robotics .
Some people use " adaptive " for software that helps people with disabilities .
Other people use " adaptive " to refer to evolutionary , neural , or biological computation .

An article in today 's Toronto Star on the city 's burgeoning debt crisis contained the following nugget of wisdom by councillor Rob Ford of Etobicoke , which I repeat here without further comment :
I can't support bike lanes .
Roads are built for buses , cars , and trucks .
My heart bleeds when someone gets killed , but it 's their own fault at the end of the day .

Christianity ’s relationship with the environmental movement has always been a rocky one .
While some groups of Christians view protecting the planet to be a sacred imperative , others – an alarmingly large number of others – believe that God gave us the Earth to use and exploit in any way we deem fit , and since Jesus is coming back real soon to destroy the world anyway , it really does n’t matter what we do to it in the meantime .
Now , Pharyngula gives us not one but two examples of prominent religious conservatives voicing the latter view – from opposite sides of the theological aisle , no less .
First , Catholic Cardinal Giacomo Biffi , whose highly appropriate former title was Archbishop of Bologna :
An arch - conservative cardinal chosen by the Pope to deliver this year ’s Lenten meditations to the Vatican hierarchy has caused consternation by giving warning of an Antichrist who is “ a pacifist , ecologist and ecumenist ” .
… Cardinal Biffi said that Christianity stood for “ absolute values , such as goodness , truth , beauty ” .
If “ relative values ” such as “ solidarity , love of peace and respect for nature ” became absolute , they would encourage “ idolatry ” and “ put obstacles in the way of salvation ” .
And on the Protestant side , Jerry Falwell , whose position on just about any issue is pretty much guaranteed to be the wrong one :
[ Falwell ] said Sunday the debate over global warming is a tool of Satan being used to distract churches from their primary focus of preaching the gospel .
“ If I decide here as the pastor and our deacons decide that we ’re going to get caught up in the global warming thing , we ’re not going to be able to reach the masses of souls for Christ , because our attention will be elsewhere , ” Falwell said in Sunday ’s sermon at Thomas Road Baptist Church in Lynchburg , Va .
“ That ’s pretty wise for Satan to concoct . ”
… Falwell quoted a scientist saying the west Antarctic ice shelf has been retreating two inches a year for 10,000 years .
“ I would back it up to 6,000 , ” Falwell quipped … … Falwell cited two Bible verses that he said apply to the global - warming debate : Psalm 24:1 - 2 , which declares “ The earth is the Lord ’s , and the fullness thereof , ” and Genesis 8:22 , which says there will be seasons of spring , summer , fall and winter for “ as long as the earth remains . ”
“ Now that alone ought to let you sleep better at night , after you read Al Gore and attend his ‘ Inconvenient Truth ’ film , ” Falwell said .
Yes , that certainly calms my fears .
The Earth is warming so rapidly that entire new islands are emerging out of melting ice in Greenland and Inuit people in the Arctic Circle now need to use air conditioners , but relax !
A book written two and a half thousand years ago by an Iron Age tribe living in a small region of the Middle East explains quite clearly that their tribal god will not allow the Earth to change too dramatically , so we have nothing to concern ourselves about .
I , for one , will sleep much better now that I have that reassurance .
Falwell and Biffi are not by any means the only Christians to voice this view .
Here ’s a similar sentiment stated even more bluntly by pastor John MacArthur :
The earth we inhabit is not a permanent planet .
It is , frankly , a disposable planet — it is going to have a very short life .
It ’s been around six thousand years or so — that ’s all — and it may last a few thousand more .
And then the Lord is going to destroy it .
I ’ve told environmentalists that if they think humanity is wrecking the planet , wait until they see what Jesus does to it .
… This earth was never ever intended to be a permanent planet — it is not eternal .
We do not have to worry about it being around tens of thousands , or millions , of years from now because God is going to create a new heaven and a new earth .
Interestingly , as Falwell and MacArthur ’s remarks show , the young - earth creationist view in particular devalues the planet and regards it as “ disposable ” .
Perhaps these believers ’ lack of appreciation for the true , vast tapestry of geologic history blinds them to what a glorious place the Earth is , and renders them less likely to care about its fate .
Statements like these are a dramatic illustration of how belief in an afterlife makes the theist more likely to view this life as unimportant , as I wrote in “ No Heavens “ .
But these views are especially dangerous , because they impact not just these individuals or their followers , but the rest of us who must share the planet with them .
We all live on this world together , and we are all connected by what happens to it .
Sulfur emitted into the air in one country causes acid rain in another ; fertilizer dumped into a river upstream causes toxic algae blooms that deprive fishers of their livelihood downstream ; carbon emitted by the United States causes melting glaciers in India and Africa and global warming in the Arctic .
We cannot solve the problem of environmental degradation in one place without solving it in all places , and we cannot do that until people around the world are united in purpose to work together .
As a result , the irrational and dangerous faith - based views of fundamentalist Christians and others who view the planet as theirs to abuse as they see fit can completely undermine the efforts of any number of informed , devoted people .
These Christians are confident – suicidally confident – that Jesus is coming back soon and that this makes any major effort at environmental protection pointless , even a Satanic deception .
Two thousand previous years of Christians have lived and died believing the same thing , but this does not give the ignorant , history - blind fundamentalists any reason to hesitate .
But as the ability of human technology to reshape our environment grows ever greater , and as we draw ever nearer to a tipping point after which any action will be too late , it is increasingly urgent that we stand up to these dangerously irrational beliefs now and defeat them .
The task that lies before us is large and grave enough without uninformed bigots nipping at the ankles of responsible people and hindering their way .
Thankfully , not all Christians are as arrogantly complacent as these three .
There are many influential Christian individuals and organizations that have signed onto “ creation care ” initiatives like the Evangelical Environmental Network or the National Religious Partnership for the Environment .
( Credit to Slacktivist for those links , who also points out that even a few apocalyptic “ dispensationalist ” Christians , like Jack Wyrtzen of Word of Life Fellowship , came aboard on the bizarre grounds that it ’s God alone , not human beings , who has the privilege of destroying the Earth .
Well , we ’ll take what we can get . )
Of course , this halting step toward rationality has been fiercely opposed by other , more conservative Christians , but the fact that there is such a movement at all is a hopeful sign .
Not all Christians are content to sit by and cheer as the world careens toward destruction .
There are good ones who understand the moral obligations in giving human beings a safe and clean environment , and who expect the planet to have a future and understand the need to protect it so that it will still be around for generations to come .
Whether they – and we – will succeed remains to be seen .
UPDATE : After posting this article , I came across an example of the kind of fierce opposition that progressive , pro-environment Christians face from fundamentalists .
The vice president of the National Association of Evangelicals , Richard Cizik , is a well - known environmental advocate who has spoken about the need to fight global warming .
Now the leaders of several prominent conservative Christian groups , including well - known rogues ’ gallery members like James Dobson , have sent a letter to the NAE demanding that they either silence Cizik or force him to resign .
As usual , these sex - obsessed theocrats claim that protecting the environment is drawing attention away from what they believe should be the only priorities of Christians , namely bashing gays and outlawing abortion and birth control .
“ We have observed , ” the letter says , “ that Cizik and others are using the global warming controversy to shift the emphasis away from the great moral issues of our time . ”
Global warming is one of the great moral issues of our time , whether or not James Dobson , Gary Bauer or Tony Perkins want to admit that .
I suspect that these people , if asked , would say that giving meat and drink to the hungry , sheltering strangers , clothing the naked , and visiting those who are sick or in prison are likewise “ issues that draw warm and fuzzies from liberal crusaders ” , whereas real Christians know that those things are just insignificant distractions from the really important moral issues , like making sure that gay couples ca n’t get health care .
So far the NAE ’s president Leith Anderson has stood behind Cizik , but only time will tell how this plays out .
This is not my fight and I cannot assist in it , but nevertheless , I wish Cizik and his allies the best of luck .
OK , so George Bush is going to defy Congressional subpoenas in the investigation into the dismissal of the eight U.S. Attorneys .
What does that mean ?
The quickest way to address that right now is to re-run a post on the subject from early December :
[ L ] et 's look at the mechanics of subpoena power .
In its investigative capacity , Congress has adopted for itself the use of a subpoena power that 's roughly analogous to that more commonly seen in the judicial and law enforcement system , in which government prosecutors ( employees of the executive branch ) leverage the power of the judicial branch ( in the form of its ability to sentence those brought before it for contempt , should they defy the subpoenas ) to ensure compliance with the demands made .
But Congress is not the executive branch .
Nor is it the judicial .
Its independent enforcement powers are limited to only the most obscure and archaic procedure -- " inherent contempt " -- which has n't been exercised since 1935 , and with good reason : this procedure itself requires a trial before Congress .
Not a particularly helpful substitute when you 're trying to avoid a trial before Congress [ read : impeachment ] in the first place .
Instead , Congress depends for its enforcement powers on the executive branch .
If you defy a Congressional subpoena , you face the possibility of charges of contempt of Congress , pursuant to the adoption of articles by whichever house is charging you .
But those charges are not self - executing .
In other words , they 're a request that charges be brought .
In order to be effective , those charges still have to be prosecuted in court , and that 's up to the discretion of the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia .
He 's an employee of the " unitary executive , " of course , and reports to the Attorney General .
So if you 're conducting oversight of , say , the NSA spying program , and you want answers from Gonzales regarding the program 's legality , and you subpoena him and he tells you to take a flying leap , what do you do ?
You could try going to court , but not only will that pretty much run out the clock , but the courts are quite likely to tell you , " What are you crying to us for ?
You have your remedy .
If you 're too chicken to use it , that 's your problem . "
They may well hand it right back to Congress as a " political question , " and refuse to resolve it .
After all , tied up in that question is yet another : should the legislative branch be able to leverage the judicial in order to force the executive to submit to its will ?
Long story short :
This is not an issue that can be resolved on moral , ethical , legal , or political grounds alone .
It can be ignored for any or all of those reasons , but not resolved .
That 's some game , eh ? Enforcement of the contempt power falls to the U.S. Attorneys -- the political strong - arming and contamination of which brought us to this crisis in the first place .
Heck , you 'd almost think they ... planned it .
[ W ] hen it comes to deploying its Executive power , which is dear to Bush 's understanding of the presidency , the President 's team has been planning for what one strategist describes as " a cataclysmic fight to the death " over the balance between Congress and the White House if confronted with congressional subpoenas it deems inappropriate .
The strategist says the Bush team is " going to assert that power , and they 're going to fight it all the way to the Supreme Court on every issue , every time , no compromise , no discussion , no negotiation . "
Realize that the resolution of this stand - off will determine the extent to which the Congress is able to investigate everything that 's still on their plate .
If they lose this showdown , they lose their leverage in investigating NSA spying , the DeLay / Abramoff - financed Texas redistricting , Cheney 's Energy Task Force , the political manipulation of science , the Plame outing ... everything .
And that 's why Bush is playing it this way .
Remember , too , that his " administration " is populated by Watergate and Iran - Contra recidivists , chief among them Dick Cheney , who has wanted to relitigate the boundaries of executive power since forever .
Cheney and others on the inside believe that this time , with a friendlier judiciary , these issues can be decided the " right " way , overturning the victories won against Richard Nixon 's insane theories of executive power .
Their thinking is that they 'll either win it in courts , or run out the clock trying .
And the day they get five Justices to say they 're right , everything you thought you knew about checks and balances becomes wrong .

About 97 % of nitrogen fertilizers are derived from synthetically produced ammonia , the remainder being by - product ammonium sulphate from the caprolactam process and small quantities of natural nitrates , especially from Chile .
The production of anhydrous ammonia is based on reacting nitrogen with hydrogen under high temperatures and pressures .
The source of nitrogen is the air , the hydrogen being derived from a variety of raw materials , including water , crude oil , coal and natural gas hydrocarbons .
The hydrocarbons provide the energy for the energy - intensive process .

Vertical farming practiced on a large scale in urban centers has great potential to :
1. supply enough food in a sustainable fashion to comfortably feed all of humankind for the foreseeable future ;
2. allow large tracts of land to revert to the natural landscape restoring ecosystem functions and services ;
3. safely and efficiently use the organic portion of human and agricultural waste to produce energy through methane generation , and at the same time significantly reduce populations of vermin ( e.g. , rats , cockroaches ) ;
4. remediate black water creating a much needed new strategy for the conservation of drinking water ;
5. take advantage of abandoned and unused urban spaces ;
6. break the transmission cycle of agents of disease associated with a fecally - contaminated environment ;
7. allow year - round food production without loss of yields due to climate change or weather - related events ;
8. eliminate the need for large - scale use of pesticides and herbicides ;
9. provide a major new role for agrochemical industries ( i.e. , designing and producing safe , chemically - defined diets for a wide variety of commercially viable plant species ;
10 . create an environment that encourages sustainable urban life , promoting a state of good health for all those who choose to live in cities .
All of this may sound too good to be true , but careful analysis will show that these are all realistic and achievable goals , given the full development of a few new technologies .

THE LIVING TOWER ( Night View )
One of the key " texts " of peak oil doom is " The Oil We Eat " -- a puff piece by Richard Manning , originally published in the Feb. 2004 issue of Harper 's Magazine .
The piece itself is basically a misanthropic screed which talks about humans " stealing " food from animals and the earth .
It also spreads the lie ( debunked in # 28 ) that fertilizer is made from oil .
Here 's Manning in top form : Manning is clearly a doomer , and a traitor to the species , who thinks the earth would be a better place without people on it , because humans are a pestilence ... a CANCER .
Still ... the idea of " eating oil " is interesting .
It makes you wonder : if we can eat oil , can we eat uranium ?
The answer turns out to be : Yes .
Nitrogen fertilizer can be produced from nuclear energy .
Consider this :
As we have seen earlier , nitrogen fertilizer is not made from oil .
It is made from natural gas ( or syngas produced from coal ) .
The interesting thing , though , is that the only part of the natural gas used in the production of ammonia ( the basis of nitrogen fertilizer ) is the hydrogen .
Since hydrogen can be produced through the electrolysis of water , it is possible to produce fertilizer from WATER , as noted in the above passage .
The energy necessary for producing the ammonia can also be derived from fission , so clearly ( if necessary ) we can turn uranium into nitrogen fertilizer .
In fact , we could even go a step further , and use uranium to supply light , heat and mechanization power for multi-story vertical farming facilities , located in the middle of the cities they feed .
This would greatly increase the carrying capacity of the earth , eliminate fuel wasted on long - distance food transport , and reduce the human footprint due to agricultural activities :
Geopolitics A New Hope ?
By Ryan McGreal
Published February 15 , 2007
Fear will keep the local systems in line - fear of this battle station .
-- Grand Moff Tarkin , Star Wars : A New Hope
I 've written before about the futility of aggressive , balance of power based approaches to foreign policy .
Unless you 're prepared to obliterate your enemy completely , subjugation and intimidation just do n't work most of the time .
That does n't stop bully states from using it again and again , to predictably disastrous results .
Two articles that crossed my screen today cast some light on this phenomenon .
In the first , published today in Salon , a piece on the situation in Israel after last year 's month - long war in Lebanon describes the failure of Israel 's much - criticized exercise of military power to accomplish any of its objectives .
[ Note : Salon requires you to click through a banner ad before you can read the article ]
According to Israeli military intelligence , Hezbollah remains firmly rooted in Lebanon and has successfully rearmed - the Iranian - backed Shiite militia now has even more missiles than it had before last summer 's war .
To many Israelis , it seems as if that war , and the destruction it brought , were all for nothing .
... Several senior [ Israeli government ] officials acknowledged unequivocally that Israel lost the war against Hezbollah , and confirmed that this is a widely held view inside the Israeli government - despite many public pronouncements to the contrary by Israeli leaders .
This flies right in the face of Likud Party orthodoxy .
For decades , the Israeli right - wing has argued that Israel needs to be able and willing , as Richard Perle argued in 1996 , to :
contain , destabilize , and roll - back some of its most dangerous threats .
This implies clean break from the slogan , ' comprehensive peace ' to a traditional concept of strategy based on balance of power .
[ Israel must also ] change the nature of its relations with the Palestinians , including upholding the right of hot pursuit for self defense into all Palestinian areas and nurturing alternatives to [ former Palestinian Authority leader Yassir ]
Arafat 's exclusive grip on Palestinian society .
Perle 's argument was based on the false premise that by beating the Palestinians hard enough , Israel would be able to pacify them , domesticate their aspirations , and convince them that passive acceptance would be less painful than active resistance .
Former Likud Party leader and Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon expressed the same sentiment in 2002 when he said , " The Palestinians must be hit and it must be very painful : we must cause them losses , victims , so that they feel the heavy price . "
With the election of Hamas and the ongoing insurgency in Palestine last year and the open presence of Hezbollah in Lebanon , the failure of this strategy is painfully evident .
According to the Salon article , many government officials and analysts in Israel are starting to blame the Bush administration 's Middle East policy for the precarious situation in which Israel finds itself .
This year 's annual report by Tel Aviv University 's Jaffee Center blames " the American failure in Iraq " for harming Israeli security and recommending that the US withdraw sooner rather than later because " There is no Israeli interest being served by a continued American presence in Iraq . "
What remains less clear is the extent to which those same analysts have recognized the the Bush administration 's strategy in the Middle East parallels that of Israel .
Just as the US tipped its hand by invading Iraq and lost the ability to threaten the use of power , so did Israel do the same when it invaded Lebanon .
Far from striking terror into enemies , these actions revealed the US and Israel as being merely human , as susceptible to resistance as any other human agency .
If anything , they emboldened their enemies , who are now ready to call the US and Israel 's bluff again .
At the same time , another development threatens to shift dramatically the underlying balance of power in the Middle East , further squeezing the US out of its former place .
The Times of London ran a remarkable essay today on a recent meeting between India , China and Russia :
Foreign ministers from the three emerging giants met in Delhi yesterday to discuss ways to build a more democratic " multipolar world " .
It was the second such meeting in the past two years and came after an unprecedented meeting between their respective leaders , Manmohan Singh , Hu Jintao and Vladimir Putin , during the G8 summit in St Petersburg in July .
It also came only four days after Mr Putin stunned Western officials by railing against American foreign policy at a security conference in Munich .
They are maintaining that their approach is democratic , cooperative , and multilateral , all of which effectively undermine the Bush administration 's authoritarian , coercive , and unilateral approach to global politics .
Of course , the situation is complicated .
India has long struggled to find a comfortable balance between co-optation and isolation and China is deeply entangled in the globalized American economy .
Of the three , Russia is the most openly anti-hegemonic , but with Putin 's authoritarian tendencies and Russia 's history , it 's not a stretch to expect that Putin really just wants a bigger piece of the action .
However , it 's clear a new non-aligned movement is starting to shape itself , and it's also clear that the biggest impetus for these new relationships is the abandonment in the US of multilateralism , diplomacy , and fairness .
To paraphrase Princess Leia , the more the US tightens its grip , the more nations will slip through its fingers .

10 ) The one that got so many people so hot under the collar .
Many people think she ’s on her front , but personally I remain unconvinced .
9 ) Very close to the original topless sunbather , this one is definitely female , I think .
It looks like she ’s lying on her front , and she does appear to have some kind of top on , so keep your hair on people !
8 ) Just six doors down , here ’s a half - naked Dutch , person .
Wearing a sarong perhaps ?
7 ) This ones been widely discussed on other sites , but I personally reckon this is a guy , wearing shorts .
Phew !
6 ) This person thinks they have privacy on this rooftop ( have n’t they seen Enemy of the State ? ) , and they ’re definitely topless !
( Sex unknown of course , but topless nevertheless . )
5 ) Outside a café on the beach ( presumably before it opened that day ) , we find someone sitting calmly in a chair , blissfully unaware the whole world can now see them in their birthday suit .
4 ) The previous nudist may have also been unaware that just on the other side of the building , there was another person sunning themselves – flat on their back and completely in the altogether !
Does anyone know someone that works in this café by the way ?
3 ) Again on the beach , here ’s a couple of naked people who think they can hide behind a wind - break !
Pah !
Do n’t they know there is no escape ?
2 ) Hiding away behind some bushes is no escape either …
Mind you , I wish that person would keep their legs together .
Yeuch !
1? ) Well , do you know of a better one ?
I ’m sure there ’s loads more brilliant ones yet to be found , so get searching !
Post a comment with your find then I ’ll add the best ones here .
Thanks to the Keyhole Users .

ONE of the few certain facts surrounding the disappearance of an Iranian former deputy defence minister is his name : Ali Reza Asghari .
Most of the other circumstances are hotly disputed .
Has he defected , as most westerners and many Arabs are assuming ?
Or was he abducted by Mossad or the Americans , as Iran 's police chief and some of the Arab press speculate ?
Is he still in Turkey ( where he disappeared ) , as the police chief believes or in Europe , as others claim ?
Some say that he is on his way to America ; others that he slipped his family out of the country quietly before his trip .
Iranian sources denied that part of the story to a Turkish newspaper , saying his wife had called , concerned about him .
The same newspaper said that Iran knew of three calls he made from his mobile phone when he arrived in Turkey : two within the country and one to Egypt .
Despite the contradictory claims it seems clear that he disappeared around February 7th while in Istanbul .
Iran did not confirm his disappearance to the Turks for ten days .
Turkey 's foreign minister , Abdullah Gul , has said that his country is working with Iranian intelligence to find him , and other Turkish officials say he is still there .
But this could be mere diplomatic courtesy , to spare the Iranians the embarrassing confirmation that Mr Asghari is lost to them .
Iran 's silence is probably one of sheepishness .
Little timidity was apparent in the statement of one American intelligence official who told the Washington Post that Mr Asghari is co-operating willingly with western intelligence , and that America has complete access to what he is saying .
What might he know ?
Possibly he has information about Iran 's nuclear programme .
Western countries believe it is designed to build bombs .
Iran denies the charge .
Iranians insist that Mr Asghari has been “ out of the loop ” for years , and anyway had nothing to do with the nuclear programme .
Milliyet , a Turkish newspaper wherein some of the more tantalising reporting on the story lies , says Turkish security sources believe Mr Asghari does know about Iran 's nuclear work .
Whatever knowledge he has of Iran 's nuclear capabilities , Mr Asghari will be almost as tempting a catch for what else he knows .
He was a high - ranking commander in the Revolutionary Guard , which leads Iran 's terror activities abroad .
Mr Asghari was the organisation 's head in Beirut in the 1980s .
The Israelis believe he played an important role in the creation of Hizbullah .
Some even call him the “ founder ” of the Lebanese Shia militia .
The many terrorist attacks carried out by the group include bombings of the American marine barracks , and the American and the French embassies in Beirut in the early 1980s , and the bombing of a Jewish cultural centre in Argentina in 1994 .
Mr Asghari may also know about the attack on an American army facility in Khobar , in Saudi Arabia , in 1996 , and more besides .
Israelis may suspect he can shed light on the fate of Ron Arad , a pilot shot down over Lebanon in 1986 and believed to have been passed on to the Iranians .
This is of more than historical interest .
His connection to the Revolutionary Guard might put Mr Asghari in a position to know quite a bit about Iran 's involvement in Iraq .
American officials have recently claimed that Iran is arming Shia militias in its troubled neighbour with sophisticated armour - piercing weapons .
Some worry that this could be used as a casus belli if America decides to strike at Iran .
If Iran is indeed innocent , Mr Asghari 's testimony might slow down any drive towards hostilities .
It is not clear why he might have defected , and his motivations will determine what he reveals .
Israeli sources told Al - Sharq al - Awsat , an Arab newspaper in London , that he was bitter at his removal from his post as deputy defence minister .
Such commonplace frustrations are often the source of surprising changes of allegiance .
But there is much more still to be learned about why he left Iran , for which he was so long a soldier , and what use he may be to its western adversaries .
The Geek Does n’t Wear Prada November 29 , 2006
Posted by Imran Ghory in job interviews
It ’s a rare occurrence to find geeks debating fashion and what to wear , but that ’s what happened a few days ago when thedailywtf ran a story about job interviews
Most of the participants fell into one of two camps , the “ pro-suits ” and the “ anti-suits ” .
The pro-suits generally took the opinion that “ a job interview is a formal event and as such not dressing formally would be inappropriate and disrespectful ” .
The anti-suit camp generally fell into “ developers should be judged on skill alone , after all what developer wears a suit anyway ? ”
Sadly both camps missed the point completely .
There is no “ golden bullet ” .
There is no definite answer about what you should wear to a job interview .
Different companies have different cultures , different countries even more so .
The single most important factor to consider when deciding what to wear is what other interview candidates will wear .
When you meet meet your interviewer for the first time they ’ll be comparing you to every other candidate they ’ve seen .
And if there ’s anything about you that ’s significantly different from everyone else that ’s what ’s going to stick in their mind as their first impression of you .
Not your skills , not your lovely personality , but what you ’re wearing .
If you ’re the only candidate who ’s turned up in a suit or a t - shirt you ’ll be remembered as “ the suit guy ” or the “ the t- shirt guy ” , not because the interviewer disapproves of your dress sense ( although they may do ) , but simply because that ’s how human memory works .
The key point I ’m making is that you do n’t want to be remembered for what you wearing , you want to be remembered for being “ the Boost wizard ” or “ the smalltalk guy ” or at least something that has some relevance to the job .
Of course if you ’ve just been called for an interview you may have no -idea what other candidates have worn in the past .
But it does n’t harm to ask , HR or your contact at the firm will almost certainly be willing to tell you what the dress code is both for day - to - day work and for the interview .
Or if you ’re reluctant to ask them then ask around , ask your friends what they would wear for an interview at that company .
But if you ’re really stuck then I ’d suggest dressing over - smartly .
There are far more companies that will reject you for looking “ unprofessional ” then there are companies that will reject you for being “ too smart ” .
Plus it ’s a lot easier to take off a tie and undo your top button to become more casual then it is to make t- shirt and jeans look professional
Why iPhone wo n’t revolutionize the mobile web landscape
~ 10 January 2007 ~
… at least not in the short - term .
First things first :
If you plan on buying an Apple iPhone this June , you better get in line in front of me , because I ’ll have $ 500 ready to leave my hands the minute the first one ’s available .
I could n’t be more elated about the announcement and more appreciative of the incredible development effort on Apple ’s part .
Several people have pinged me asking my thoughts about how much the iPhone will change the mobile web landscape , seeing how I ’m in the midst of authoring a book on the subject .
My reply ?
Hardly at all .
Here ’s my reasoning :
Content zooming is n’t new .
Do n’t get me wrong — the UI features in “ Safari Mini ” ( or whatever the new name ) are no doubt really cool , but the technology to see an entire web page and zoom in / out — “ adaptive zooming ” , “ mini- map navigation ” , what have you — has existed , to my knowledge , for some time now ( at least a year ? ) .
Additionally , Opera has been developing similar technology for non-desktop browsers , notably of late in the version for Nintendo Wii ( video ) .
I really like the idea of viewing the exact same site on a mobile , but I question how practical it is for every site .
( Nor is the idea of mobile widgets new , while we ’re at it . )
Data costs will continue to plague subscribers .
Take the NYTimes.com example shown in the keynote .
We can probably expect “ Safari Mini ” to compress images and code to reduce download size much like other mobile user agents , but at the current NYTimes document size of +500 KB you could potentially pay $ 5.00 just to download the home page once , if paying per KB for data access .
I ’m currently subscribed to data plans on two different providers ( Sprint , Cingular ) .
One has unlimited , the other a 5 MB / mo cap .
I surf endlessly on the unlimited plan , but I ’m very cautious about web content on the other .
Granted , iPhone owners will likely be unlimited plan subscribers , but still .
( For the record , let it be said I expect unlimited data plan growth / affordability to continue to increase the next few years . )
Context is still king .
At the end of the day , the iPhone is a device built for mobility .
And with mobility , there are limitations and opportunities that should be addressed , both of which are roughly the same for iPhone as that of nearly any mobile device .
Consider the Google Maps app , for example .
Firstly , Google Maps Mobile has been widely available on a variety of devices for some time now .
Secondly , if iPhone is n’t GPS - enabled , that is to say it can tell where I ’m at rather than typing in my location , it does n’t radically alter the existing experience anyway .
The UI is slick for sure , but beyond that I ’m still at the mercy of text entry .
i Phone owners wo n’t be the typical mobile web user .
If the mobile web is to become anything more than rich internet access for elite phone subscribers , we must look beyond Blackberrys , Treos and yes , iPhone .
Currently India is outpacing all other countries in mobile subscriptions growth ( source ) , but do n’t expect them to be iPhone owners anytime soon — or owners of devices with similar capabilities , speaking in terms of a subscriber majority .
All this aside , while the iPhone wo n’t revolutionize the mobile industry as a whole anytime soon , it will revolutionize the individual mobile web experience , and come June that ’s about all that will matter for me .

Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales is targeting the fourth quarter of this year for the unveiling of an open - source search engine that he hopes could challenge the dominance of market - leaders Google Inc. and Yahoo Inc .
The project is being run through Wikia Inc. , a for - profit company founded by Wales that seeks to use a similar model to the Wikipedia community - written and edited encyclopedia .
He hopes to provide the tools and technology to allow programmers across the Internet to collaborate on the development and testing of a search engine and make the results freely available .
" The essential core principles are that I think search is now a fundamental part of the infrastructure of the Internet and it's really fundamental to society as a whole and therefore as citizens of the world we should be concerned about it being a secretive black box , " he said .
Efforts to create open search engines are n't new but one of the stumbling blocks they face is a difficulty in running large - scale tests of the search algorithm , said Wales .
The algorithm is the code that sits at the heart of the search engine and is responsible for its accuracy or lack thereof .
" To create a full - scale crawling spider of the Web actually requires a great deal of investment in hardware , " he said .
Wikia is planning to provide resources to enable full - scale crawling of the World Wide Web so the software can be fully tested and tuned .
The project is still in the planning stages and Wales expects that the first test version due this year will help programmers spot bugs that occur with real - world usage and speed up the development process .
" Probably what we 'll do is launch something in the fourth quarter of this year with a really big warning ' It sucks , we know it sucks , it 's experimental , do n't panic .
This is just an experiment to show what could be and now we 're going to start working to see how we could make it better ' , " he said .
Already the project is attracting attention , not just from engineers who want to lend a hand but from companies that are already offering search engines .
" We are getting a lot of interest from second - tier search players who are really interested in some of the alternatives that might be available .
If you 're not one of the top three or four you 've got to really wonder how could you ever catch up with Google and their billions of dollars .
This provides kind of a level playing field where lots of people can contribute , " said Wales .
Wales cites a story he heard about research done on search results .
In the study users were presented with results from Google and Yahoo but with the brand names switched , so the Google name was above the Yahoo results and vice versa .
In most cases users picked the Google - branded results as better , he said .
" To me this shows a great vulnerability if Google is only competing on brand image , " said Wales .
" If good quality search results are becoming a commodity , if the problem of search is in some sense solved then if I can make that free it really changes the structure of competition on the Internet . "
" We 'll give away all the technology , all the data .
Release everything under a free license because in my view the idea has been very solidly proven wrong by Wikipedia that in order to out - compete on the Internet you need to have a walled garden of special content no one else has .
Wikipedia gives everything away .
You can download the database and put up a clone of Wikipedia tomorrow .
All that means is that more people find out about the brand , more people drive traffic back , " he said .
Even if multiple competitors spring up using the Wikia search engine he 's hopeful the Wikia site can still grab a 2 percent or 3 percent share of the search market and so would become " a pretty decent little business . "
But just how successful the search engine is will depend on more than just its accuracy .
The search algorithm is the most closely guarded secret of companies like Google because it determines how high a particular site is ranked .
If the algorithm is public then it would mean site owners could precisely tune their sites for high rankings and that 's sure to attract the attention of spammers .
Wales hopes a community effort will result in a black list of abusers to keep the results clean .
" If published algorithms make it too easy for spammers to game the system then we 've got a real problem and my whole idea wo n't work , " he said .

The processes of inflammation are a potent source of age - related cellular damage , as this first article reminds us :
...
Chronic inflammation is so similar in different diseases , Libby said , that when he lectures , he uses many of the same slides , whether he 's talking about diseases of the heart , kidneys , joints , lung , or other tissues .
Only a few years ago , heart attacks were explained as a plumbing problem -- blood vessels that became clogged with atherosclerotic plaque as " bad " ( LDL ) cholesterol was deposited on vessel walls .
Now , doctors know that this bad cholesterol gets embedded inside artery walls as well , where the immune system " sees " it as an invader to be attacked .
The ongoing inflammation in arteries , essentially a revved up immune response , can eventually damage arteries and cause " vulnerable " plaque to burst .
It is because inflammation is now seen as such a hallmark of heart disease that many doctors use a test for inflammation called CRP to help assess a person 's cardiac risk .
It 's long been known that type 1 diabetes is linked to inflammation -- the body 's immune system attacks the cells that make insulin .
Now , new research is suggesting that type 2 diabetes , the kind that generally sets in in adulthood , often begins with insulin resistance , in which cells stop responding properly to insulin .
Doctors now know that during chronic inflammation , one of the chemicals released is TNF , or tumor necrosis factor , which makes cells more resistant to insulin .
" " No one would have thought these things were related , " but they are , said Dr. Walter Willett , chairman of the department of nutrition at the Harvard School of Public Health .
The TNF connection also helps explain why obesity , particularly abdominal obesity , leads to diabetes .
" Fat cells used to be thought of as storage depots for energy , as metabolically inactive , " said Libby .
" Now we know that fat cells are little hotbeds of inflammation .
Excess fat in the belly is a great source of inflammation . "
Autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis are also believed to be linked to inflammation .
In arthritis , for instance , inflammatory cells called cytokines lead to the production of enzymes that break down cartilage in joints .
Inflammation also plays some role in Alzheimer 's disease , said Linda Van Eldik , a neurobiologist at the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine .
Whenever the brain is injured or infected , cells in the brain called glia pump out cytokines .
Normally , this response shuts down when the injury or infection is over .
" But in chronic neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer 's , these glial cells are activated too high or too long or both , " Van Eldik said .
The plaques and tangles in patients ' brains attract the attention of glial cells , making them pump out even more cytokines to try to repair this damage and creating chronic inflammation .

In Defense of Pattern Matching
by Martin Odersky
June 29 , 2006
Summary
Pattern matching is much maligned by object - oriented programmers .
I wonder why ?
Advertisement
As I wrote before , Scala aims to unify object - oriented and functional programming .
When people talk about functional programming , they usually mean one of two different things :
In the exclusive sense , functional means no side - effects .
In the inclusive sense it means a programming style which composes functions in interesting ways .
When I talk about functional programming , I usually mean it in the inclusive sense .
A number of language constructs are called functional because they are used a lot in functional languages or because they first appeared in a functional language .
Three such features are :
functions as first - class values
parameterized types
pattern matching
When I talk to many advocates of object - oriented programming , they readily embrace the first two .
After all , functions as first - class values are also found in Smalltalk ( where they are called blocks ) , Python , or Ruby .
The next version of C# is going to have them , and I would not be surprised if a future version of Java also acquired them .
Parameterized types are also very common , with variations such as C++ templates , or the generics of Eiffel , Java 1.5 or C# 2.0 .
But when I propose pattern matching , I get violent outbursts of rejection .
The arguments against are usually a permutation of :
Pattern matching is unnecessary , just use the visitor design pattern .
Pattern matching is not extensible .
Pattern matching breaks encapsulation .
I disagree , obviously .
``Pattern matching is unnecessary '' - Sure , one can use the visitor pattern to get something similar .
But visitors require a lot of code scaffolding .
Also , they do n't allow nested patterns .
To pick an example ( complete code ) , let 's say I want to simplify arithmetic expressions .
Expressions are given by the following Scala class hierarchy :
class Term case class Num(n : int ) extends
Term case class Var( name : String ) extends
Term case class Mul(l : Term , r : Term ) extends
Term case class Add(l : Term , r : Term ) extends
Term
There is a base class
Term with four subclasses :
Num for numbers , Var for variables , Mul for multiplication operations , and Add for addition operations .
So the term ( 2 * x ) would be represented as new Mul ( new Num ( 2 ) , new Var( x ) ) .
Note that each of the four subclasses has a case modifier .
This means we can pattern match on it , and also that we get an implicit factory method with the same name as the case class .
With the factory methods , we can abbreviate the term above to Mul ( Num ( 2 ) , Var(x ) ) .
Now let 's say we want to implement some simplification rules on such terms .
Two useful simplifications apply the equalities :
0 * x = 0 1 * x = x
With pattern matching they can be expressed straightforwardly :
def simplify ( term : Term ) = term match { case Mul( Num ( 0 ) , x ) => Num ( 0 ) case Mul ( Num ( 1 ) , x ) => x case _ => term }
How much harder is this with a visitor ?
I invite you to try it out !
``Pattern matching is not extensible '' -
This assumes that pattern matching can only be done on so - called algebraic datatypes which have a fixed number of cases .
This is indeed the common approach in functional languages ( an exception are polymorphic variants in OCaml ) .
In Scala , however , any class can be labeled a case class .
It would be perfectly possible to define other case classes that inherit from Term in different compilation units .
``Pattern matching breaks encapsulation '' - I think this is a misunderstanding in that people assume that pattern matching can inspect the internal fields of an object .
But in Scala , pattern matching simply reverses the construction process .
That is , you can find out through pattern matching what is the case class of the selector value and what are its constructor parameters .
Any internal fields remain hidden .
Also , if you do n't want your clients to see the way an object was constructed , do n't mark its class as a case class .
So , in summary I think pattern matching is extremely convenient and is a good fit with object - oriented programming .
I wonder why not more mainstream languages have adopted it .

To prove this , he has worked on a number of language designs , from Pizza to GJ to Functional Nets .
He has also influenced the development of Java as a co-designer of Java generics and as the original author of the current javac reference compiler .

Nintendo's Big Idea is Not the Wiimote
The main problem with modern games , he says , is that they require players to invest enormous amounts of time .
Nintendo's Big Idea is Not the Wiimote
Posted Oct 27 , 2006 — 26 comments below Posted Oct 27 , 2006 — 26 comments below
This whole Wii thing has been bouncing around in my head for weeks .
There 's some common thread between it , the Nintendo DS , the iPod and even Mac OS X .
Is it less technology ?
Is it simpler technology ?
Is is overall experience ?
Then , of all publications , The Economist hit the nail right on the head .
The Economist article paraphrases for Nintendo president Satoru Iwata : That 's it in a nutshell , at least for me .
The physical interactions of the Wii look interesting , and that 's probably enough to differentiate it from PS3 and Xbox on the surface , but the new players wo n't stay if they have to restructure their entire schedule to find time to play .
The idea that you need to spend a lot of time upfront just to get oriented in a game before you actually get to the fun part is one thing .
It 's something else to consider you 'll spend a lot more time trying to get to the end .
How much of that time will equate to fun versus going through the motions is anyone 's guess .
This was the basic problem I had with Oblivion for Xbox 360 .
Within a few hours of playing , I found out that the game is insanely deep andconstructed .
This sort of thing is only possible now because of more advanced hardware .
It 's not just RPGs .
The same is true with many of the newer car racing titles .
Part of me thinks ( or thought ) what I want in a game is a deep , intricate world which rewards exploration .
The problem is that aworld leaves you with the same dilemma as the real world : it 's not always obvious what you 're supposed to be doing .
Do I need to simulate this ?
The question is n't if I 'll feel like the game is rewarding after I play it for a while , but if it 's fun .
Why endure gameplay that is n't fun ( for me ) for the possibility of fun later ?
Realism is part of fun , but only two a point .
For a time , games wereunrealistic ( meaning 8 - bit games ) that it was distracting .
As the hardware got better , the distraction of unconvincing graphics slowly melted away .
But infinitely more realism does n't necessarily mean infinitely more fun .
I can't help but share a story that comes up in my head over and over again , because it fits so perfectly here .
My family went to Universal Studios about 15 years ago and I remember one of the stops on the " train " tour is the " avalanche . "
The train drives through a cylindrical , rotating tunnel .
As you enter , the train tracks tilt about 20 degrees to the right to give you the impression that you 're rotating too .
The tilt is " just enough " to experience the sensation without actually going through all the silliness of the train actually rolling over so you fall out along with all of your possessions and your loved ones .
Enough realism to be convincing , but only to the point that it 's serving the purpose of enjoyment .
The thing that 's strikingly obvious now about Mario Brothers for the DS is that in most cases , any particular moment is fun .
There 's almost no learning curve , and you 're rarely trying to figure out what to do , or digging through menus , or anything of that nature .
You can play for a few minutes , and just turn it off any time .
A game like Brain Age is actually designed for many short sessions of play .
Even with more complex / specialized Nintendo games like Zelda , you 're rarely bogged down in piles of busy work .
It always feels there 's an immediacy to your actions .
You 're generally not building up experience points or that sort of thing .
So what I want is fun more than a " deep world . "
Maybe the counterpart to that in a computer is the idea of " deep features .
" I need to meditate on all of this a bit more , but I have a feeling part of the link between the the Nintendo devices and the Mac / iPod is the assumption the user does not want to invest time .
That is , the Mac tries to not assume that you 're a " computer person . "
Sometimes it 's simply unavoidable , or we 'd end up with an appliance more than a general - purpose computer .
A quick glance at Photo Booth shows this mentality in action .
No wizards , no tips of the day , no toolbars .
Just what you need for the task at hand .
The iPod is the same way .
Instead of making a big deal about synching and playing music , it just does it .
A lot of gadgets get attention initially because of theof the thing .
It 's new , it 's shiny , it has fancy specs on the side of the box .
It seems like a moment in history .
Those moments are great , and even Apple and Nintendo users bask in them , but what sets the Mac , iPod and Nintendo devices apart is that you 're still drawn to them after the initial newness wears off .
The minute - to - minute experiences are n't a chore .
They 're simple , so they 're in harmony with your real life .
Does any of this make sense ?
It 's very late .
Scientists find potential ' off - switch ' for HIV virus
RAW STORY
Published : Thursday January 11 , 2007 Print This Email This
The following is a press release regarding an announcement from Princeton University about a " potential ' off - switch ' " for the HIV virus .
The university 's research was " funded in part by the National Institutes of Health , " according to the release .
#
While there is no cure for lingering viral infections such as HIV and herpes , a recent study at Princeton University suggests it may be possible to deactivate such viruses indefinitely with the flick of a genetic switch .
Princeton scientists Leor Weinberger and Thomas
Shenk hope their work will illuminate the processes by which human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) and other viruses transition into dormant phases in their hosts .
The researchers have discovered a specific genetic trigger that makes HIV fall into its latent phase , where the virus essentially hibernates , relatively harmlessly , but awaiting an opportunity to re-emerge and wreak havoc .
Weinberger and Shenk studied how an HIV protein , called Tat , plays a major part in initiating and also interrupting the cascade of chemical reactions that leads to full - blown infection .
Based on their work and previous studies by others , they have proposed that the Tat protein and the enzymes that modify it serve as a " resistor , " a component of an electrical circuit that reduces the flow of current .
" The resistor paradigm is a helpful way to think about how HIV enters and exits latency , and it might serve as a useful model for latent infections by other viruses , as well , " said Shenk , Princeton 's James A. Elkins Jr. Professor in the Life Sciences in the Department of Molecular Biology .
" Understanding how to activate the Tat resistor to interrupt the reactions leading to viral infection could one day have repercussions in both the lab and the clinic . "
Weinberger and Shenk share their findings in a research paper appearing in the Dec. 26 issue of the online journal Public Library of Science Biology .
" We have helped understand how HIV can turn off , and in doing so I believe we 've uncovered an important component of the biological switch , " said Weinberger , a Lewis - Thomas Fellow in Princeton 's Department of Molecular Biology .
" If we can figure out how such resistors affect viruses , it might lead to a whole new class of drugs that can treat some of the world 's most dangerous illnesses . "
Though Weinberger emphasized the significance of the discovery was primarily for fundamental science research , he said that potential applications to HIV might be an improvement over drug cocktails , which are the mixtures of antiviral agents that have been the best - available treatment for the disease for a decade .
" Drug cocktails extend the life of the patient , but they do not completely alleviate the symptoms of HIV , nor do they work for all victims , " Weinberger said .
" Even when the cocktails get most of the infectious virus in a victim 's body , some viruses will escape because they have hidden by going dormant .
Eventually , these dormant viruses wake up and the infection returns , so it makes sense to try to keep the virus asleep if possible . "
HIV weakens the body 's immune system by invading CD4 +
T cells , which in essence serve as the metaphorical generals in the body 's defense system against illness .
When an HIV virus particle invades a T cell , most often it converts the cell into a factory for making other viral particles , killing the cell in the process .
Without these T cells , the body loses its ability to repel other infectious bacteria and viruses , and eventually dies from assaults from these other " opportunistic " infectious invaders .
On rare occasions , however , a virus will infect the T cell and become dormant .
Why this individual viral infection would not begin to replicate when others do remains a mystery .
" It 's somewhat like the unpopped kernels of corn left in the bottom of the bag when you take it out of the microwave , " Weinberger said .
" They were exposed to the same heat as the others but did not pop .
We wanted to know why about one in a million HIV particles did n't ' pop ' immediately like all the rest did . "
Weinberger and Shenk found the answer in a strand of HIV's DNA where a genetic circuit exists -- not an electrical circuit , but a set of chemical reactions that runs in a loop .
First , one of HIV 's genes creates the Tat protein , which is part of the chemical signal for the virus to begin replicating .
An important player to complete the signal is an enzyme within the T cell called p300 that decorates the Tat protein with a small chemical tail .
The p300 enzyme converts the Tat protein into a message that activates the virus and creates more
Tat protein , and eventually converts the T cell into an active HIV factory .
" The more of these [ messages ] sensed within the cell , the more
Tat proteins the gene creates , resulting in a snowball effect that is difficult to stop , " Weinberger said of the onset of full - blown infection .
Mechanisms do exist to halt the process , however .
For example , another enzyme within the affected cell called SirT1 is capable of pulling the chemical tail off the Tat protein , rendering it silent .
The interplay between p300 and SirT1 comprises the resistor and can effectively keep the virus in its dormant phase .
" SirT1 reduces the strength of the signal to replicate , " Weinberger said .
" It may prove to be the key part of the resistor in the circuit , as our mathematical models are strongly suggesting . "
Not all the molecular players are known yet , nor how their relative roles determine whether the virus becomes dormant , but Weinberger said his and Shenk 's results lead them to think they are on the right track .
If their theories prove correct , they could form the basis for therapies that combat HIV and other viruses that possess these genetic circuits within their own DNA .
" SirT1 and related processes might eventually turn off viral activation in T cells all by themselves , but the cell is usually dead before it can happen , " Weinberger said .
" If we can create drugs that target these enzymes , perhaps we can get SirT1 and related enzymes to assert themselves immediately , forcing HIV into hibernation with high frequency and reducing the threat to the host . "
Weinberger said that drugs already exist that target other cellular enzymes , so there is reason to hope the approach will work .
" There is precedent for this type of treatment , " he said .
Though more research will be needed to develop drugs based on the Princeton scientists ' " resistor " model , Weinberger said he hopes the discovery stimulates more research into potential gene - targeted therapies .
" It would be wonderful to learn more about how these genetic circuits work so that we can enter a new age of drug design , " he said .
" Rather than just giving a static drug , we might one day design therapies that are precisely timed to turn off viruses just like a natural genetic circuit might . " #
WASHINGTON , Feb . 24 — Internal Justice Department performance reports for six of the eight United States attorneys who have been dismissed in recent months rated them “ well regarded , ” “ capable ” or “ very competent , ” a review of the evaluations shows .
The performance reviews , known as Evaluations and Review Staff Reports , show that the ousted prosecutors were routinely praised for playing a leadership role with other law enforcement agencies in their jurisdictions .
The reviews , each of them 6 to 12 pages long , were carried out by Justice Department officials from 2003 to 2006 .
Each report was based on extensive interviews , conducted over several days with judges , other federal law enforcement agencies and staff members in each office .
It had been known that the reports were mostly favorable , but the reports themselves had not been made public .

Wellington , New Zealand
For the moment , the colossal squid is being kept frozen
More details
And for now , this beast of the deep - all 495 kg ( 1,090 lb ) of it - is safely frozen in a one - cubic - metre block of ice at New Zealand 's national museum , Te Papa Tongarewa , in Wellington .
The squid ( Mesonychoteuthis hamiltoni ) came into the institution this week after being caught last month by fishermen operating in Antarctic waters .
Eventually , when the curators at Te Papa are ready , this unique specimen will be thawed to allow detailed investigation .
But that could be up to a year away .
It will require the biggest tank of anything we 've got
Bruce Marshall
Only then can the delicate work of un - freezing this massive mollusc begin .
Dead lump
" It 's got to be thawed out slowly .
You can't put hot water on it , you 've just got to thaw it out naturally , " says Te Papa 's mollsuca collections manager Bruce Marshall .
To minimise handling of the precious specimen , the colossal squid will probably have its temperature raised , over days , in the tank in which it will finally be " fixed " .
" We do n't want to move it too much , " says Marshall .
" When a thing like that is in the water , it 's neutrally buoyant .
The squid could well be the largest specimen ever found
" Already it 's got puncture marks from the net . "
Once un -frozen , the creature will be fixed , or embalmed , and then a long - term preservative will be used .
" What I mean by a fixing tank is a tank that you lay it out in , in a natural position , and you then make all the adjustments - align all the arms , pack out the body and all of that .
Then you have it in a , say , 5 % formalin solution .
" It will require the biggest tank of anything we 've got . "
Sexing squid
Mesonychoteuthis hamiltoni was first identified in 1925 after two tentacles were recovered from a sperm whale 's stomach .
Since then , only a handful of colossal squid have ever been sighted .
Two were found in the Ross Sea , and another turned up near South Georgia in 2005 .
SIZE COMPARISON
This latest colossal squid was caught by a New Zealand fishing vessel in Antarctica 's Ross Sea in early February .
Next week will see an official handover from New Zealand 's Fisheries Minister , Jim Anderton , to Te Papa 's chief executive , Dr Seddon Bennington .
Scientists will be keen to ascertain the creature 's gender ; and then we may get a little closer to understanding just how big these squid can grow .
Marshall thinks that given its size - an estimated 10 m ( 33 ft ) in length - it is likely to be a female , as female squid are often larger than males .
" It 's extremely unlikely to be a male , " says Marshall .
" If it is a male , the mind boggles at how big the female would be . "

See the team ’s lineup below …
President Bush teared up on Memorial Day and said we must complete the mission in Iraq to honor the 18,000 wounded and 2,400 - plus dead .
Well , I have a question .
What is the mission ?
Is it to overthrow Saddam Hussein ?
He ’s been overthrown and is awaiting execution by a kangaroo court we selected to do the hit .
Is it to allow the Iraqi people to hold elections ?
They ’ve held three elections — one for an interim government , one for a Constitution , and one for a permanent government , which is now in place except for two Cabinet positions .
Oh , I forgot that when the president was selling this war , he said the mission was to disarm Saddam because he had all those awful weapons of mass destruction .
Well , of course , they did n’t exist , and now the president does n’t talk about them .
But if the purpose was to install an elected government , why are we still there ?
Why are we spending half a billion dollars to build the world ’s largest embassy , one that dwarfs Saddam ’s palaces and that ticks off the Iraqi people ?
Why , after three years and billions of our tax dollars , do the Iraqi people lack electricity , clean water and sewers ?
They had all those things under Saddam until we destroyed them with our bombs and missiles .
And if we want the Iraqi army to handle security , why are its soldiers still driving around in Toyotas ?
Where are their armored personnel carriers , their tanks , their light machine guns and light artillery ?
Surely there is a lot of that stuff left over .
Why does n’t the president stop spreading heifer dust ?
We take an 18 - year - old kid , give him 18 weeks of training and ship him off to combat .
Is this administration saying it takes five years to train an Iraqi lad ?
I think the only real mission left is to wipe the egg off the president ’s face .
The invasion of Iraq was unconstitutional .
There was no declaration of war , just a namby - pamby , you - can - use - force - if - you - want - to resolution passed by those spineless mountebanks who inhabit Congress .
It was illegal under international law , since Iraq had not attacked us or even threatened to attack us .
Iraq was cooperating with the arms inspectors and telling the truth about the lack of weapons .
That ’s why the U.N. Security Council refused to give the president the resolution he wanted as a cover for his war .
Most of all , though , it was flat stupid , as anybody who knows the Middle East could have told him .
To use a favorite phrase of his father , when the prez ordered the invasion of Iraq , he stepped into deep doo - doo of the camel variety .
I doubt if he knows how to get out of Iraq even if he wanted to , and I do n’t think he does .
I think he intends to stay there indefinitely .
And if that ’s his intention , then he should tell the American people that their sons and daughters will continue to die or be maimed indefinitely .
The Iraqis are a fierce people .
No elf is going to sprinkle fairy dust on them and make them fall in love with us .
Why should they ?
We destroyed their country and caused the deaths of 500,000 Iraqi children just with the sanctions , not counting the thousands we ’ve killed since then .
The Iraqis have many admirable traits , but I do n’t think forgiveness is one of them .
Does the president remember what the Iraqi father told an American officer when the officer asked what compensation he would accept for his son , whom one of our soldiers had killed ?
He said , " Ten dead Americans . "
And what has the president ’s blundering accomplished ?
He ’s converted an old enemy of Iran into a new ally of Iran .
Did he hear the Iraqi prime minister when he said no attacks on Iran from Iraqi soil will be tolerated ?
Did the president hear him when he said Iran has a right to enrich uranium ?
The president has created gas lines in an oil - rich country .
He ’s restarted inflation and the Cold War .
Perhaps we ’re the ones who should be tearing up .
We have two more years of this guy , and he still believes that , except for a misspoke word now and then , he ’s done everything right .
At least he ’s smart enough not to go hunting with Dick Cheney .
That ’s our small consolation .

The Best of Charley Reese
Computer science is not only a comparatively young field , but also one that has had to prove it is really science .
Skeptics in academia would often say that after Alan Turing described the concept of the “ universal machine ” in the late 1930 ’s — the idea that a computer in theory could be made to do the work of any kind of calculating machine , including the human brain — all that remained to be done was mere engineering .
The more generous perspective today is that decades of stunningly rapid advances in processing speed , storage and networking , along with the development of increasingly clever software , have brought computing into science , business and culture in ways that were barely imagined years ago .
The quantitative changes delivered through smart engineering opened the door to qualitative changes .
Computing changes what can be seen , simulated and done .
So in science , computing makes it possible to simulate climate change and unravel the human genome .
In business , low - cost computing , the Internet and digital communications are transforming the global economy .
In culture , the artifacts of computing include the iPod , YouTube and computer - animated movies .
What ’s next ?
That was the subject of a symposium in Washington this month held by the Computer Science and Telecommunications Board , which is part of the National Academies and the nation ’s leading advisory board on science and technology .

New House Speaker Shows She 's Boss
Sworn in just over two weeks ago as the first female speaker of the House , Nancy Pelosi wasted no time showing who 's boss .
The California Democrat rammed six major bills through the House at breakneck speed , stomped out smoking privileges near the House floor , partially sidelined a powerful Democratic committee chairman and decided she liked traditionally Republican office space so much she claimed it for herself .
By Democrats ' timekeeping , she did it all in far under the 100 legislative hours she had allotted .
. . .
Pelosi's initial agenda , completed Thursday , included measures with wide popular support : increasing the minimum wage , broadening stem cell research , allowing government bargaining on Medicare drug prices , cutting student loan costs , putting in place terrorism - fighting recommendations from the Sept. 11 commission and rolling back energy company tax breaks .
Each bill passed with bipartisan majorities and Pelosi triumphantly gaveled down the votes , at one point banging the gavel so enthusiastically that it left a small dent in the podium .
. . .
Pelosi is held in higher regard than the president or her colleagues in the Congress .
An AP - AOL News poll taken Jan. 16 - 18 put her approval rating at 51 percent — much higher than that of Congress ( 34 percent ) or Bush ( 36 percent ) .
Rep. George Miller , D - Calif. , a close ally , called Pelosi 's performance " spectacular . "
" What the Democrats in the caucus are telling me is that this is the best three weeks of their life , " he crowed .
Newly demoted Republicans have been able to do little but watch unhappily from the sidelines , echoing the complaint often made by Democrats during their 12 years in the minority : that they are being shut out of the legislative process .
Yet several GOP lawmakers said it hardly is surprising that Pelosi is flexing her muscles now that she is leading the Democrats ' return to power .
" Speaker Pelosi worked a long time to earn this opportunity to be elected speaker , and she is totally enjoying her first month on the job , " said Rep. Tom Reynolds , R - N.Y .
" It 's not that she 's the first woman , it 's her style , " he added .
" She 's a risk taker . "
Before Nancy Pelosi was even inaugurated as Speaker , the super - smart Washington punditocracy had all but declared her an absurd failure -- a figure far too weak , vindictive and just generally ridiculous to be able to get anything done .
After all , she backed Jack Murtha rather than Steney Hoyer for Majority Leader and decided she did n't want Jane Harman as Intelligence Committee Chair , so her whole Speakership had unraveled before it even began .'s
Wolf Blitzer spoke behind onscreen text that read : " Damaged Goods " ?
Blitzer inquired : " how badly is Nancy Pelosi damaged politically ? "
In , Gloria Borger accused Pelosi of " demeaning " her " exalted position " and said she " MSNBC had a lengthy giggling session devoted to nothing but hilarious mockery over what a silly failure Pelosi was ( as Digby , who watched that segment , put it : they " have just spent half an hour discussing the fact that Nancy Pelosi ruined her own honeymoon and now it is really questionable whether she can lead " ) .'s Timothy Noah decreed : " Let Pelosi remain speaker for now .
But let her know that , before the new Congress even begins , she has placed herself on probation . "
Noah warned her : " One more strike — even a minor misstep — and House Democrats will demonstrate that they , unlike Speaker - elect Pelosi and President Bush , know how to correct their mistakes . "
And the very commentators agreed heartily that Pelosi 's first week had been a " real embarrassment " and a " disaster " and fretted in unison : " How can Pelosi recover ? "
On and on that went for weeks -- the hapless Democrats burdened with this vindictive , bitter woman who had alienated everyone with her petty bickering to the point where her " ability to lead " was in question .
And all of that wisdom solidified in mid-November , almost two full months before Pelosi was even Speaker .
Now that she has actually begun , how do those prognostications look ?
About as good as the punditocracy 's prognostications about Iraq .
From AP today
The article goes on to detail that even " Blue Dog " Democrats have nothing but good things to say about Pelosi , that she has been vigilant about complying with her various promises , and has even attracted the respect and compliments of various House Republicans , notwithstanding their being upset about their lack of influence : I wonder if Tim Noah took her off her two - strike probation yet .
The point here is not that Pelosi is the Greatest Speaker Ever .
She has only been in office less than a month and any judgments about her Speakership would be absurdly premature ( though less absurdly premature than the tidal wave of condemnations and even death sentences before she even began ) .
But what is notable is just how vapid and ill - informed all of that chatter was that filled up the airwaves and conventional - wisdom - spouting newspaper and magazine columns for weeks and weeks after the midterm election .
As I wrote in November when the Pelosi - is - Damaged - Goods theme was in full force : " Nancy Pelosi , and really everyone , would be well - advised not to listen to them and , above all , never adopt as a goal trying to please or satisfy them .
They are frivolous and out of touch with everything that matters and should be treated as such . "
Obviously , Pelosi has learned that lesson a long time ago and it has served her quite well .
There really are few things less reliable and more wrong than the country 's predominant pundit class .
Analysis Apple 's iPhone announcement and Cisco's iPhone trademark lawsuit has brought the iPhone moniker into the spotlight .
But other companies also own and use iPhone trademarks , and market and sell their iPhone products .
Mark Rasch explains how US trademark law works and the real issues at play in this highly publicised trademark dispute .
Earlier this month , Apple Computer , now known as just " Apple " , became embroiled in a trademark lawsuit with Cisco Systems Inc over Apple 's proposed use of the term " iPhone " in connection with its new smartphone .
Cisco claims that Apple 's use of the term infringes its trademark and creates a " substantial likelihood of confusion " with Cisco 's iPhone product .
Apple says Cisco 's claim to trademark protection is tenuous .
In this case , it is quite possible that both trademarks can peacefully coexist .
In the words of Rodney King , " ca n't we all just get along ? "
Primer on trademark law
There is much confusion in non-academic circles about just what is a trademark , a service mark , and exactly how you get one , lose one , or protect one .
Put simply , a trademark is nothing more than something that is associated with the provider of goods , and a service mark is something that is associated with a provider of services .
Thus , company names like " General Motors " or " Cisco " are trademarks , just as particular product lines like " Mustang " or " Big Gulp " .
Trademarks can include colours ( yellow and red for Kodak film ) , logos , typefaces , tag lines ( " good to the last drop " ) and may also include what is called " trade dress " – how the product or packaging looks ( anyone see the new LG " Prada " phone ? ) .
The idea is , when you see the trademark , you think of the particular item or company , and not something else .
One myth about trademarks is that you have to do something to get one .
In fact , all you have to do , really , is just use the trademark .
Open a pet spa in Topeka , Kansas called " Dog Day Afternoon " and you have a trademark .
You could stop someone else from opening a competing store with the same name .
If you want additional legal protection , and you want to put people on notice about not only the identity but also the scope of your trademark , you can register your trademark .
In the United States , this is done through a filing with the United States Patent and Trademark Office .
You can also protect trademarks that you intend to use later on .
Now , not everything can be trademarked .
I could n't trademark the phrase " Law Office " for the provision of legal services because the term is descriptive rather than identifying .
But the phrase " 1-800 - LAWYERS " or lawyers.com might be subject to trademark .
If something merely describes what it is , or if the description is or becomes generic , then trademark protection may either not be grated or may be lost .
Thus , companies have had to fight to keep their trademarks from becoming generic – think " Kleenex " or " Jello " or in earlier times " Sanka " , " Radarange " , or " Frigidare " .
Another common myth is that two people cannot have the same trademark .
Not true .
Kelly Tires , Kelly Furniture , Kelly Temporary Employment services are all registered trademarks .
Two trademarks can peacefully coexist if , for example , they describe substantially different products or services , exist in different geographic areas , or are otherwise sufficiently distinct or are made so .
( Another example : Burlington Coat Factory is not associated with Burlington Industries ... )
If anyone has any doubts about the content industry 's resolve to destroy fair use and usher in new ways of charging you for uses that were previously both free and fair , look no further .
As part of the triennial review of the effectiveness of the DMCA , a number of content - related industries have filed a joint reply ( PDF ) with the government on the effectiveness of the DMCA and the challenges that lay ahead for copyright .
As you might expect , the document is a celebration of the DMCA , and the industries are pushing for even more egregious abuses of technology to fatten up their bottom lines .
With regards to the argument that the DMCA is bad law because it prevents users from making backups , the joint reply dismissed such arguments as " uncompelling . "
First , they argue that there is no evidence that " any of the relevant media are ' unusually subject to damage in the ordinary course of their use . ' "
This " cart - before - the - horse " argument suggests that people do not need to backup anything that does not have a high failure rate a view that fundamentally misunderstands the purpose of backups .
Furthermore , they argue that the success of DVD sales vis-à - vis VHS demonstrates that whatever problem there might be , it 's not big enough to matter to consumers , because DVD sales are skyrocketing while VHS is n't .
Thus high sales volumes are indicators that the consumer are well served , which is an argument that we 'll hope never takes hold in the pharmaceutical industry ( Vioxx sure did sell well ! ) .
Such are the lengths they will go through in order to keep the anti-circumvention provisions of the DMCA intact .
But supporting the status quo is n't in their interest .
No , the idea is to embrace and extend .
To wit , the joint reply also argues that making backups of your CDs is also not fair use .
The [ submitted arguments in favor of granting exemptions to the DMCA ] provide no arguments or legal authority that making back up copies of CDs is a noninfringing use .
In addition , the submissions provide no evidence that access controls are currently preventing them from making back up copies of CDs or that they are likely to do so in the future .
Myriad online downloading services are available and offer varying types of digital rights management alternatives .
For example , the Apple FairPlay technology allows users to make a limited number of copies for personal use .
Presumably , consumers concerned with the ability to make back up copies would choose to purchase music from a service that allowed such copying .
Even if CDs do become damaged , replacements are readily available at affordable prices .
Similar to the motion picture industry , the recording industry has faced , in online piracy , a direct attack on its ability to enjoy its copyrights .
( emphasis added )
As you can see , the argument is hinged partially on the cost of replacements .
Why should you be allowed to make backups of CDs you 've purchased when you can replace them ?
And why should CD backups be legal when users can already decided to purchase from ( DRM - laden ) services that do allow the limited copying of lossy music files ?
Here , again , we see the way in which the RIAA et al. would like to see contract law take over the domain of fair use .
" Leave it up to DRM , you big dummies ! "
But they 're not done with that argument .
The real kicker is buried in a footnote , where the joint reply suggests the unthinkable : that making copies of CDs for any purpose may , in fact , be infringement .
Nor does the fact that permission to make a copy in particular circumstances is often or even " routinely " granted , see C6 at 8 , necessarily establish that the copying is a fair use when the copyright owner withholds that authorization .
In this regard , the statement attributed to counsel for copyright holders in the Grokster case , is simply a statement about authorization , not about fair use .
Allow me to translate : just because people have been copying CDs in the past does n't mean that that they had the authorization to do so , and a general trend does not override such explicit authorization .
But as the EFF has picked up , the RIAA is engaging in a little historical revision .
Their last comment about the Grokster case is attempting to change the substance of comments that were uttered by their own legal counsel .
Why they would do this is abundantly clear when you see the statement in question :
" The record companies , my clients , have said , for some time now , and it 's been on their website for some time now , that it 's perfectly lawful to take a CD that you 've purchased , upload it onto your computer , put it onto your iPod . "
It looks like someone is having a change of heart .
In the world of the joint reply , if and when the RIAA and its member studios say that copying your CDs is not permitted , then it 's not permitted .
Forget fair use .
Forget historical precedent .
The joint reply here is arguing that copyright owners have the authority to deny what has become fair use what their own lawyers have admitted is fair use in front of the Supreme Court of the United States .
The upshot is that this argument suggests that the most common form of CD " copying " — namely ripping CDs for use on computers and portable players — is not necessarily fair use .
The joint reply adds :
Similarly , creating a back - up copy of a music CD is not a non-infringing use , for reasons similar to those the Register canvassed in detail in her 2003 determination that back - up copying of DVDs cannot be treated as noninfringing .
[ Ed note : see above arguments . ]
While we recognize that access controls may in some circumstances affect copying , the fact remains that there is no general exception to the reproduction right to allow back - up copying ( except the limited exception in ? 117 for computer programs ) and thus no justification for allowing circumvention of access controls for this purpose .
Inasmuch as the joint reply was grafted in defense of the DMCA , it remains unclear if the RIAA has any plans to take up this line of argument in front of legislators or the public .
It does mark , however , yet another development in the erosion of fair use , and it demonstrates that the insidious notion of " customary historic use " stems from part of the industry 's campaign to legislate new business models that fly in the face of fair use , the doctrine of first sale , and limited copyrights .
Donald Norman concludes that simplicity is overrated : “ But when it came time for the journalists to review the simple products they had gathered together , they complained that they lacked what they considered to be ‘ critical ’ features .
So , what do people mean when they ask for simplicity ?
One - button operation , of course , but with all of their favorite features . ”
A long time ago , I wrote : “ A lot of software developers are seduced by the old ‘ 80/20 ’ rule .
It seems to make a lot of sense : 80 % of the people use 20 % of the features .
So you convince yourself that you only need to implement 20 % of the features , and you can still sell 80 % as many copies .
“ Unfortunately , it ’s never the same 20 % .
Everybody uses a different set of features .
In the last 10 years I have probably heard of dozens of companies who , determined not to learn from each other , tried to release ‘ lite ’ word processors that only implement 20 % of the features .
This story is as old as the PC .
Most of the time , what happens is that they give their program to a journalist to review , and the journalist reviews it by writing their review using the new word processor , and then the journalist tries to find the ‘ word count ’ feature which they need because most journalists have precise word count requirements , and it ’s not there , because it ’s in the ‘ 80 % that nobody uses , ’ and the journalist ends up writing a story that attempts to claim simultaneously that lite programs are good , bloat is bad , and I ca n’t use this damn thing ‘ cause it wo n’t count my words . ”
Making simple , 20 % products is an excellent bootstrapping strategy because you can create them with limited resources and build an audience .
It ’s a Judo strategy , using your weakness as a strength , like the way the Blair Witch Project , filmed by kids with no money at all , used the only camera they could afford , a handheld video camera , but they invented a plot in which that was actually a virtue .
So you sell “ simple ” as if it were this wonderful thing , when , coincidentally , it ’s the only thing you have the resources to produce .
Happy coincidence , that ’s all , but it really is wonderful !
What works for bootstrapping , I believe , will not work as a good long term strategy , because there ’s very little to prevent the next two - person startup from cloning your simple app , and because eventually you ca n’t fight human nature :
“ The people want the features , ” says Norman .
Just because handheld video was perfect for Blair Witch , does n’t mean every Hollywood blockbuster will use it .
Devotees of simplicity will bring up 37signals and the Apple iPod as anecdotal proof that Simple Sells .
I would argue that in both these cases , success is a result of a combination of things : building an audience , evangelism , clean and spare design , emotional appeal , aesthetics , fast response time , direct and instant user feedback , program models which correspond to the user model resulting in high usability , and putting the user in control , all of which are features of one sort , in the sense that they are benefits that customers like and pay for , but none of which can really be described as “ simplicity . ”
For example , the iPod has the feature of being beautiful , which the Creative Zen Ultra Nomad Jukebox does n’t have , so I ’ll take an iPod , please .
In the case of the iPod , the way beauty is provided happens to be through a clean and simple design , but it does n’t have to be .
The Hummer is aesthetically appealing precisely because it ’s ugly and complicated .
I think it is a misattribution to say , for example , that the iPod is successful because it lacks features .
If you start to believe that , you ’ll believe , among other things , that you should take out features to increase your product ’s success .
With six years of experience running my own software company I can tell you that nothing we have ever done at Fog Creek has increased our revenue more than releasing a new version with more features .
Nothing .
The flow to our bottom line from new versions with new features is absolutely undeniable .
It ’s like gravity .
When we tried Google ads , when we implemented various affiliate schemes , or when an article about FogBugz appears in the press , we could barely see the effect on the bottom line .
When a new version comes out with new features , we see a sudden , undeniable , substantial , and permanent increase in revenue .
If you ’re using the term “ simplicity ” to refer to a product in which the user model corresponds closely to the program model , so the product is easy to use , fine , more power to ya .
If you ’re using the term “ simplicity ” to refer to a product with a spare , clean visual appearance , so the term is nothing more than an aesthetic description much in the same way you might describe Ralph Lauren clothes as “ Southampton WASP , ” fine , more power to ya .
Minimalist aesthetics are quite hip these days .
But if you think simplicity means “ not very many features ” or “ does one thing and does it well , ” then I applaud your integrity but you ca n’t go that far with a product that deliberately leaves features out .
Even the iPod has gratuitous Solitaire game .
Even Ta-da List supports RSS .
Anyway , I gotta go … it ’s time to go upgrade my cellphone to one that includes high speed internet access , email , a podcast catcher , and an MP3 player .
PARIS , March 19 — Russia has informed Iran that it will withhold nuclear fuel for Iran ’s nearly completed Bushehr power plant unless Iran suspends its uranium enrichment as demanded by the United Nations Security Council , European , American and Iranian officials say .
The ultimatum was delivered in Moscow last week by Igor S. Ivanov , the secretary of the Russian National Security Council , to Ali Hosseini Tash , Iran ’s deputy chief nuclear negotiator , said the officials , who spoke on condition of anonymity because a confidential diplomatic exchange between two governments was involved .
For years , President Bush has been pressing President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia to cut off help to Iran on the nuclear power plant that Russia is building at Bushehr , in southern Iran .
But Mr. Putin has resisted .
The project is Tehran ’s first serious effort to produce nuclear energy and has been very profitable for Russia .
Recently , however , Moscow and Tehran have been engaged in a public argument about whether Iran has paid its bills , which may explain Russia ’s apparent shift .
But the ultimatum may also reflect an increasing displeasure and frustration on Moscow ’s part with Iran over its refusal to stop enriching uranium at its vast facility at Natanz .
A 58 - year - old Jerusalem woman is not a typical MySpace user - the hugely popular social networking site is inhabited mostly by people at least 30 years younger .
But the profile she is reading is a profile with a difference : it represents the entire state of Israel .
Officials hope that running a MySpace page dedicated to Israel will help improve relations with people from other countries , and increase awareness and communication with those under 35 .
The idea belongs to David Saranga , a diplomat based at the Israeli consulate in New York .
Mr Saranga said research had shown Israel 's image among the young was not good , and that by reaching out through one of the internet 's most popular sites he could repair some of the damage .
" We saw that we had a problem with the 18 to 35 age group .
The reason is that this group does n't see Israel as relevant .
We have to talk to them in their language , in platforms they are using , and the new media is one of the ways to do so , " he said .
The page is particularly targeted at young Americans , who make up a large proportion of MySpace users .
Since Mr Saranga set up the page , " Israel " has gained 963 friends from around the world , including fictional characters such as TV secret agent Jack Bauer and Star Wars heroine Princess Leia , as well as , it is claimed , the Hollywood actors George Clooney and Leonardo Di Caprio .
The pages include pictures of Israeli cities , as well as music that invites the audience to question the cycle of violence and to " end this holy war " .
Among Mr Saranga 's other initiatives are a blog called " isRealli " and an internet TV station .
Optimising TortoiseSVN December 28 , 2006
As noted in other posts , I am currently using Subversion for source code control , with TortoiseSVN as the “ GUI ” client .
Recently I ’ve been having big performance problems on my machine , particularly with Windows Explorer .
Getting rid of most of the network drives that I ’ve added helped quite a bit , and then I turned my attention to TortoiseSVN .
Our SVN repository is located in New York , whilst we are in London , and the network between the two sites is not great .
For example , when we moved offices our new network was only 10 mbit /s rather than 100 mbit / s. Gigabit ?
Tish and pshaw !
Combined with the fact that our project is 436 Mb means that SVN can sometimes crawl .
I began digging into the TSVNCache .exe process .
TSVNCache determines which icons should be displayed in Windows Explorer , indicating modifications , conflicts , etc .
I then read this article about possible optimisations .
By switching on the TSVNCacheWindow I could see that tens of thousands of directories were being cached .
The first thing was to remove branches that were no longer being used .
Despite having no modifications for several months , they were being repeatedly indexed by TSVNCache .
Next was to specify the directories that I wanted icon overlays for .
Into the “ Include Paths ” I added my C:\dev\trunk and C:\dev\Branches \ directories , with “ * ” after each of them so as to get recursive info .
Into the “ Exclude Paths ” I added C:\* , thereby excluding everything else .
Performance was now significantly better , but I was n’t satisfied .
The final act was to switch on “ Show overlays only in explorer ” , which disables the overlays in File Open dialogs and other non-Explorer windows .
This was an area where I had had particular problems .
The machine is now lightning - fast , far better than it had become and much more like the dual - core , dual - physical 3.2 Ghz Xeon with 2 Gb that it ’s supposed to be .
My settings are shown here .
VANCOUVER -- Champagne bubbled at the University of B.C. 's zoology lab as scientists celebrated the discovery of a secret trick used by fish to live without breathing .
Scientists and anglers have long known the crucian carp , which lives under ice - and snow - covered ponds in Scandinavia , had a special respiratory system .
It can live up to four months without oxygen .
UBC researcher Jonathan Stecyk has been feted in the October issue of the journal Science for his study into how the fish pulls it off , which could have implications for people .
" Maybe one day we 'll be able to make a human heart work the same way , " he said .
" If you think about heart transplants , you only have a couple hours to transplant the heart from the donor to the recipient .
If you could somehow extend that time period , you 'd have more hearts to give to people who need them .
" Hopefully people will see this research and be inspired to exploit the abilities of this fish , " he said .
Stecyk was so intrigued by the carp , he went to Norway and climbed into a fishing boat .
For three weeks , he scooped the fish nets and studied the fish .
He wanted to see how the carp 's heart worked when it was n't breathing and discovered that it could maintain normal levels of cardiac activity without oxygen .
Its brain also continued to send control messages to the heart that kept it pumping .
He is the first scientist to report such a finding in a vertebrate .
" Most ( vertebrates ) die within a minute , others show strongly suppressed cardiac activity , " he said .
He believes the carp is able to carry on normal cardiac pumping without oxygen by ridding itself of lactic acid - the stuff that produces a burning sensation in human muscles after exercise - by converting it to ethanol , an alcohol , which is much less harmful .
A regular heartbeat may ensure that ethanol is circulated to the gills , where it is excreted to the surrounding water .
" Otherwise you 'd have an intoxicated fish , " he said .
Much like some in the lab who celebrated the printing of Stecyk 's work in Science .
Stecyk is optimistic the recognition will hook more carp research dollars and more discoveries , though the Canadian government has already been quite supportive .
" So far it has n't been hard .
I 'm only 26 and I 've been to Europe six times to do studies and I 've never had to pay .
" It 's great , you meet so many different people and learn all these new ways of looking at scientific problems , " said Stecyk , a PhD candidate in UBC 's zoology department .
He is preparing to return to Norway in late October to test his guess that the carp is able to maintain normal cardiac activity by converting lactic acid to ethanol and excreting it .

The Causes of the Economic Crisis is a collection of articles on the business cycle , money , and exchange rates by Ludwig von Mises that appeared between 1919 and 1946 .
Here we have the evidence that the master economist foresaw and warned against the breakdown of the German mark , as well as the market crash of 1929 and the depression that followed .
Mises presents his business cycle theory in its most elaborate form , applies it to the prevailing conditions , and discusses the policies that governments undertake that make recessions worse ( even before Keynes 's General Theory appeared ! ) .
He recommends a path for monetary reform that would eliminate business cycles as we have known them and provide the basis for a sustainable prosperity .
In foreseeing the interwar economic breakdown , Mises was nearly alone among his contemporaries — which is particularly interesting because Mises made no claim to possessing clairvoyant powers .
To him , economics is a qualitative discipline .
But among those who say that economics must be quantitative with the goal of accurate prediction , neither the pre-monetarists of the Fisher school nor the Keynesians foresaw the economic damage that would result from central bank policies that manipulate the supply of money and credit .
Why is this ?
Most economists were looking at the price level and growth rates as indicators of economic health .
Mises 's theoretical insights led him to look more deeply , and to elucidate the impact of credit expansion on the entire structure of the capitalistic production process .
The essays were well known to contemporary German - speaking audiences .
They had not come to the attention of English audiences until 1978 , four years after F.A. Hayek was awarded the Nobel Prize for , in particular , " his theory of business cycles and his conception of the effects of monetary and credit policies . "
In tribute to Hayek 's excellent contributions , the Austrian theory of the business cycle has long been called a Hayekian theory .
But it might be more justly called the Misesian theory , for it was Mises who first presented it in his 1912 bookand elaborated it so fully in the essays presented in this new book from the Mises Institute .
Although the articles address issues that were debated many years ago , the analysis presented by Mises are as relevant today as they were in his time .
Mises reached his conclusions regarding events of the day by means of a coherent theory , as applied to current events , rather than attempting to derive a theory from data alone , as many of his contemporaries did .
This is what gave his writings their predictive power then , and it is what makes his writings fresh and relevant today .
A proper economic theory such as Mises presents here applies in all times and places .
As in the past , most economists today believe that sophisticated mathematical and statistical methods can torture the data enough to reveal some causal link between events and yield a theory of inflation and the business cycle .
But this is a senseless exercise .
It is no more fruitful than a purely descriptive account and it has no more predictive value than a simple data extrapolation .
These essays have been buried in obscurity for far too long .
How fortunate we are to have them in a form that can reach a mass audience .
Reading the writings of this great master economist might convince some economists and policy makers that there is no substitute for sound thinking .
Economics is far too important a subject to be left in the hands of the trend extrapolators , data torturers , and monetary central planners who rely on them .
Do we need ever more money ?
In his articles from 1919 to 1923 .
Mises addressed the factors that were responsible for German hyperinflation .
For Mises , inflation is defined as money creation , the act of which tends to manifest itself through the fall in the purchasing power of money ( PPM ) .
Thus for a given demand for money , an increase in its supply lowers the PPM .
Whenever monetary authorities allow the rate of monetary pumping to proceed at an accelerating pace , the purchasing power of money tends to fall by a much larger percentage than the rate of increase in money supply .
Mises attributed this to increases in inflationary expectations .
Peoples ' expectation that the future PPM is likely to fall causes them to lower the present demand for money .
This sets in motion a mechanism that , if allowed to continue unabated , can ultimately break the monetary system .
Inflationary expectations lead the suppliers of goods to ask for prices that are above what the holders of money can pay .
Potential buyers do n't have the money to purchase the goods .
The emerging shortage of money , according to Mises , is an indication that the inflationary process has gained pace and cannot be " fixed " by raising the supply of money .
On the contrary , policies that accommodate this shortage can only make things much worse .
Ultimately , the sellers demand astronomical prices , transactions with inflated money become impossible , and the monetary system falls apart .
Mises argued that without an impenetrable link to gold , it is not possible to eradicate inflation .
Gold cannot be printed , and it thereby evades the politicians ' desires and wishes and keeps the economy healthy .
For Mises , the real purpose of paper money is to give politicians control over the supply of money .
In response to the view that there is not enough gold to support growing trade , Mises argued that any given amount of gold can fulfill all that money is required to do : provide the services of a medium of exchange .
Additional quantities of gold cannot improve on the economic function of money .
It was also Mises 's view that the international exchange rate of the domestic money tends to follow inflationary trends , all other things being equal .
For Mises , a currency rate of exchange is determined by the relative purchasing power of respective monies .
Any rate of exchange that deviates from the relative purchasing power of money makes it profitable to sell commodities for overvalued money and buy commodities with undervalued money .
This brings the rate of exchange of a currency in line with the relative purchasing power of respective monies .
This opinion clashes with popular thinking both then and today that the currency rate of exchange is set by the state of the balance of payments .
Do we need policies aimed at stabilizing prices ?
Having established that the purchasing power of money is set by the relative supply and demand for money , Mises ridiculed the view that the PPM can or should be " stable . "
The notion of stability is compatible only with the imaginary conditions of economic equilibrium — a state of no change .
Money is of little use in the state of equilibrium ; it is only of use in the state of change .
What 's more , once we accept stability as a policy goal , it would appear that having a money paper standard is a policy solution .
Only a central bank should manipulate the money supply to bring about price stability and economic equilibrium .
In this view , the existence of the gold standard is the major obstacle for attaining the goal of price stability , since the supply of gold is not under the control of the stabilizers , i.e. , the central bankers .
There is a problem here , however .
Even if we were to agree that the stable purchasing power of money leads to better economic conditions , we need to be able to quantify the PPM to provide a benchmark .
But there are no means to determine scientifically the total purchasing power of money ( PPM ) .
The various price indexes that were suggested by the American economist Irving Fisher to calculate the PPM were just exercises in wishful thinking .
For instance , there is no way to determine what type of average one should select in establishing the average price , and there are no objective criteria to prefer a geometrical average over an arithmetical average .
Mises raises the issue of weighing the importance of various goods in the index .
In the world of change such weighting — i.e. , the importance people attach to various goods and services — is constantly in flux .
So even if one ignores various mathematical problems associated with the construction of price indexes , they can at best only describe frozen human beings , or automatons .
Mises concludes that policies of stabilizing the price level must only lead to more instability .
Why ?
Because policies of stabilizing the PPM are in fact tampering with the prices of goods , which by implication must be a destabilizing act .
Also , these policies generate a redistribution of wealth from the late receivers of the newly injected money to the early receivers of money .
Some individuals derive benefit at the expense of other individuals .
Economic Business Cycles And Their Causes
In the slump of a cycle , businesses that were thriving come to experience difficulties or go under .
They do so not because of firm - specific entrepreneurial errors but rather in tandem with whole sectors of the economy .
People who were wealthy yesterday have become poor today .
Factories that were busy yesterday are shut down today , and workers are out of jobs .
Businessmen themselves are confused as to why .
They cannot make sense of why certain business practices that were profitable yesterday are losing money today .
Bad business conditions emerge when least expected — just when all businesses are holding the view that a new age of steady and rapid progress has emerged .
In his writings , Mises argued against the prevailing explanation of the business cycle by overproduction and under- consumption theories , and he critically addressed various theories that depended on vague notions of mass psychology and irregular shocks .
In the psychological explanation , an increase in people 's confidence regarding future business conditions gives rise to an economic boom .
Conversely , a sudden fall in confidence sets in motion business stagnation .
Now , there can be no doubt that during a recession people are less confident about the future than during good times .
But to observe this is not to explain it .
Likewise theories that view various shocks and disruptions as the central cause behind boom - bust cycles do not advance our knowledge regarding the boom - bust cycle phenomenon .
Neither explains how the boom and bust come about , nor why they are of a recurrent nature .
To arrive at a correct explanation , we need to trace the change in business conditions back to a previously established and identified phenomena , and that is precisely what these theories do not do .
Hence Mises concluded that all these theories do not provide an explanation but rather describe the phenomenon in a different way .
That is to say , it does not help us to understand rain to define it as something that makes the ground wet .
Mises also held that various statistical and mathematical methods are others ways of describing but not explaining events .
Statistical methods make it possible to generate charts of data fluctuations but they do not improve on our knowledge of what causes the fluctuations .
The Circulation Credit Theory of Business Cycles
Mises made a distinction between credit that is backed by savings , and credit that does not have any backing .
The first type of credit he labeled commodity credit .
The second he labeled circulation credit .
It is circulation credit that plays the key role in setting the boom - bust cycle process .
Consider a producer of consumer goods who consumes part of his produce while saving the rest .
In the market economy , our producer could exchange the saved goods for money .
The money that he receives can be seen as a receipt as it were for the goods produced and saved .
The receipt is his claim on the goods .
He can then make a decision to lend the money to another producer through the mediation of a bank .
By lending the money of the original saver , the lender transfers his claims on real savings to the borrower .
The borrower can now use the money — i.e. , the claims — and secure consumer goods that will support him while he is engaged in the production of other goods ( say , tools and machinery ) .
The credit in this case is fully backed by savings and permits the expansion of tools and machinery .
With better infrastructure , it is now possible to produce not only more goods but goods of a better quality .
The expansion of real wealth is now possible .
Once a lender lends his money , he relinquishes his claims on real goods for the duration of the loan .
In an unhampered market economy , borrowers are users of savings who make sure that savings are employed in the most efficient way : generating profits .
This means that real savings are employed in accordance with consumers ' most important priorities .
We can thus see here that as long as banks facilitate commodity credit , they should be seen as agents of wealth generation .
In contrast , whenever banks embark on the lending of circulation credit they in fact become agents of real wealth destruction .
As opposed to commodity credit , circulation credit is not supported by any real saving .
This type of credit is just an empty claim created by banks .
In the case of commodity credit , the borrower secures goods that were produced and saved for him .
This is , however , not the case with respect to the circulation credit .
No goods were produced and saved here .
Once the borrower uses the unbacked claims , it is at the expense of the holders of fully backed claims .
In this way , circulation credit undermines the true wealth generators .
Now , as a result of an increase in the supply of circulation credit money , market interest rates fall below the natural rate , that is , the rate that would be established by supply and demand if real goods were loaned directly in barter without the use of money .
( In his later articles , Mises referred to the natural rate as the rate that would be established in a free market . )
As a result of the artificial lowering of interest rates , businesses undertake various new capital projects to expand and lengthen the production structure .
Prior to the lowering of interest rates , these capital projects did n't appear to be profitable .
Now , however , as money market rates are kept below the natural rate , economic activity zooms ahead and an economic boom emerges .
Such a situation cannot last .
Mises here explains the important role played by the subsistence fund .
The expansion of the production structure is always constrained by the availability of the means of sustenance ( saved consumer goods ) to maintain workers during the period of the expansion and the enhancement of the production structure .
The forced lowering of interest rates bring into being production processes that would not otherwise be undertaken .
A production structure is now created that produces goods and services that consumers in fact cannot afford .
Instead of using the limited pool of the means of sustenance to make tools and machinery that will generate consumer goods on the highest individual priority list , the means of sustenance are wasted on capital goods that are geared towards the production of low - priority consumer goods .
At some point , the producers of such goods will discover that they cannot make a profit or even complete their plans .
What we have here is not over - investment but misdirected investment or malinvestment .
The expansion of the production structure takes time and the limited subsistence fund may not be sufficient to support the expansion of the capital structure .
If the new flow of the production of consumer goods does not emerge quickly enough to replace the currently consumed consumer goods , the subsistence fund comes under pressure .
At some point in time , banks discover that they do n't have the savings to back their loans and that marginal businesses are starting to under - perform .
All this causes them to curtail the expansion of circulation credit , which in turn raises interest rates .
This undermines business funding , and can often be the precipitating event that leads to an economic bust .
Mises wrote that the bust phase of the business cycle process could be precipitated by other events .
The expansion in the money supply enriches the early receivers of money .
Those individuals who have now become wealthier as a result of receiving the money may alter their pattern of consumption .
This may force businesses to adjust to this new setup .
Once the rate of expansion in money slows down or comes to a halt , the new pattern of consumption cannot be supported and the new capital structure that was erected becomes unprofitable and must be abandoned .
It is not surprising that Mises was strongly opposed to the idea that central banks should impose " low " interest rates during a recession in order to keep the economy going .
Instead , he believed that the policy makers should not engage in the artificial lowering of interest rates but rather refrain from any attempts to manage the economy via monetary policy .
By curtailing its interference with businesses , the central bank provides breathing space to wealth generators and thereby lays the foundation for a durable economic recovery .
In the shelves of books on the business cycle , this one stands out for its theoretical clarity and also its historical prescience .
May its appearance earn for Mises his rightful place in history as an economist who dared to break with the pack , think for himself , and provide a clear explanation while everyone else was in pan

In the 1960s , researchers in the Soviet Union began an ambitious drilling project whose goal was to penetrate the Earth ’s upper crust and sample the warm , mysterious area where the crust and mantle intermingle⁠ — the Mohorovičić discontinuity , or “ Moho . ”
So deep is this area that the Russian scientists had to invent new ways of drilling , and some of their new methods proved quite inventive .
But despite the valiant effort which spanned several decades , the Russians never reached their goal , and many of the Earth ’s secrets were left undiscovered .
The work done by the Soviets did , however , provide a plethora of information about what lies just beneath the surface , and it continues to be scientifically useful today .
The project is known as the Kola Superdeep Borehole .
Beginning in 1962 , the drilling effort was led by the USSR ’s Interdepartmental Scientific Council for the Study of the Earth ’s Interior and Superdeep Drilling , which spent years preparing for the historic project .
It was started in parallel to the Space Race , a period of intense competition between the U.S. and U.S.S.R .
The survey to find a suitable drill site was completed in 1965 when project leaders decided to drill on the Kola Peninsula in the north - west portion of the Soviet Union .
After five more years of construction and preparations , the drill began to nudge its way into the ground in 1970 .
Core samples from 6 km below the surface
Inside the project ’s 200 - foot - tall enclosure resides a unique drilling apparatus .
Most deep - drilling rigs use a rotating shaft to bore through the ground⁠ — using a series of extensions which are incrementally added as the hole grows deeper⁠ — but such a method was unworkable with a hole as deep as Kola was planned to be .
To overcome this , the Russian researchers devised a solution where only the drill bit at the end of the shaft was rotated .
They accomplished this by forcing the pressurized “ drilling mud ” ⁠— the lubricant pumped down the drill shaft⁠ — through the specially - designed drill bit to cause it to spin .
Today , the deepest hole ever created by humankind lies beneath the tower enclosing Kola ’s drill .
A number of boreholes split from the central branch , but the deepest is designated “ SG - 3 , ” a hole about nine inches wide which snakes over 12.262 kilometers ( 7.5 miles ) into the Earth ’s crust .
The drill spent twenty - four years chewing its way to that depth , until its progress was finally halted in 1994 , about 2.7 kilometers ( 1.7 miles ) short of its 15,000 - meter goal .
The Soviet ’s drilling rig was designed such that core samples would be provided along the entire length of the drill shaft , providing researchers on the surface with an intimate look at the composition of the Earth as the drill ventured further downward .
Before the superdeep borehole project was undertaken , practitioners of Geology had reached a number of conclusions regarding the Earth ’s deep crust based on observations and seismic data .
But as is often the case when humans venture into the unknown , Kola illustrated that certainty from a distance is no certainty at all , and a few scientific theories were left in ruin .
One scientist was heard to comment , “ Every time we drill a hole we find the unexpected .
That ’s exciting , but disturbing . ”
To the surprise of the researchers , they did not find the expected transition from granite to basalt at 3 - 6 kilometers beneath the surface .
Data had long shown that seismic waves travel significantly faster below that depth , and geologists had believed that this was due to a “ basement ” of basalt .
Instead , the difference was discovered to be a change in the rock brought on by intense heat and pressure , or metamorphic rock .
Even more surprisingly , this deep rock was found to be saturated in water which filled the cracks .
Because free water should not be found at those depths , scientists theorize that the water is comprised of hydrogen and oxygen atoms which were squeezed out of the surrounding rocks due to the incredible pressure .
The water was then prevented from rising to the surface because of the layer of impermeable rocks above it .
The Kola Core repository in Zapolyarniy
Another unexpected find was a menagerie of microscopic fossils as deep as 6.7 kilometers below the surface .
Twenty - four distinct species of plankton microfossils were found , and they were discovered to have carbon and nitrogen coverings rather than the typical limestone or silica .
Despite the harsh environment of heat and pressure , the microscopic remains were remarkably intact .
The Russian researchers were also surprised at how quickly the temperatures rose as the borehole deepened , which is the factor that ultimately halted the project ’s progress .
Despite the scientists ’ efforts to combat the heat by refrigerating the drilling mud before pumping it down , at twelve kilometers the drill began to approach its maximum heat tolerance .
At that depth researchers had estimated that they would encounter rocks at 100 °C ( 212 °F ) , but the actual temperature was about 180 °C ( 356 °F ) ⁠— much higher than anticipated .
At that level of heat and pressure , the rocks began to act more like a plastic than a solid , and the hole had a tendency to flow closed whenever the drill bit was pulled out for replacement .
Forward progress became impossible without some technological breakthroughs and major renovations of the equipment on hand , so drilling stopped on the SG - 3 branch .
If the hole had reached the initial goal of 15,000 meters , temperatures would have reached a projected 300 °C ( 572 °F ) .
When drilling stopped in 1994 , the hole was over seven miles deep ( 12,262 meters ) , making it by far the deepest hole ever drilled by humankind .
The last of the cores to be plucked from from the borehole were dated to be about 2.7 billion years old , or roughly 21 million times older than Coca Cola .
But even at that depth , the Kola project only penetrated into a fraction of the Earth ’s continental crust , which ranges from twenty to eighty kilometers thick .
The Kola drill site as of 2012
Kola was not the first nor the last attempt at drilling a superdeep borehole , but it has been the most successful so far .
In 1957 the United States embarked on a similar project dubbed Project Mohole , but that attempt to drill through the ocean floor was cancelled due to lack of funding .
Today , the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program seeks to penetrate the much thinner crust of the ocean floor to probe the Earth ’s lower crust .
The huge repository of core samples are housed at Zapolyarniy , about 10 kilometers south of the borehole .
The Kola Superdeep Borehole was a scientifically useful site until 2008 , when the site was abandoned .
In Soviet Russia , drill bores you .

Harvey Keitel speaks out on " Showbiz Tonight about the controversy ABC's " Path to 9/11 " has caused and in which he stars .
Download - WMP Download - QT ( rough transcript - not full )
Keitel : Yea , I had questions about events -- material I was given in the Path to 9/11 that I did raise questions about .
Yes , I had some conflicts there .
Q : How was that met ?
Keitel : With discussion ..ummm with argument .
When I received the script it said ABC history project -- I took it to be exactly what they presented to me .
History -- and that facts were correct .
It turned out not all the facts were correct and ABC set about trying to heal that problem ..
In some instances it was too late because we had begun .
Q : Do you feel that anything should be changed in this film ?
Keitel : Yes I do .
This is a tough issue .--( sure )
You can compile certain things as long as the truth remains the truth .
You can't put things together , compress them and then distort the reality .
Q:... in the case of September 11th though , do you feel that it is an absolute responsibility that it be factually accurate even if it is a dramatization ?
Keitel : Absolutely , you cannot cross the line from a conflation of events to a distortion of the event .
No .
Where we have distorted something we have made a mistake - and that should be corrected .
It can be corrected .
It can be corrected by the people getting involved in the story that they are going to see .

Seventy percent of respondents said the country was heading in the wrong direction , compared with 23 percent who said they approved of the direction in which the country was heading .
Those findings are not significantly different from the responses to a CBS News poll last week and suggest that Americans are more pessimistic about the country 's direction than at any other time in the 23 years that The Times and CBS News have asked the question .
Immigration is another issue undercutting Republicans and Mr. Bush .
As Republicans battle over how to respond to illegal immigration , the poll found considerable opposition to the strict measures being pressed by conservative Republicans in the House .
About 60 percent of respondents said they favored the plan proposed by some Republicans in the Senate that would permit illegal immigrants who had worked in the United States for at least two years to keep their jobs and apply for citizenship .
Just 35 percent endorsed the view of some conservatives that illegal immigrants should be deported .
Two - thirds opposed building a 700 - mile fence along the United States - Mexican border .
The two biggest problems for Mr. Bush and Republicans are gasoline prices and Iraq .
By 57 percent to 11 percent , respondents said they trusted Democrats more than Republicans to find a way to curb gasoline prices .
Nearly two - thirds of respondents said the increase in gasoline prices was not beyond the control of a president , but 89 percent said this administration did not have a plan to deal with the problem .
More than two - thirds said the war in Iraq was to blame for at least some of the increase in gasoline prices .
Seventy - one percent said they believed that oil companies were profiting from higher prices , and a majority said oil companies were much closer to the Republican Party than to the Democratic Party .
" Bush could put in some kind of regulation to control the profits of the oil companies , " said Jane North , 43 , a Republican from Reisterstown , Md. , who said she recently changed her registration to Democrat .
" He comes from the oil business , so he certainly knows how it works .
I think Bush will just run out his term and not do anything to control gas prices . "
Here 's a mystery for you .
Renegade urban graffiti artist Banksy is clearly a guffhead of massive proportions , yet he 's often feted as a genius straddling the bleeding edge of now .
Why ?
Because his work looks dazzlingly clever to idiots .
And apparently that 'll do .
Banksy first became famous for his stencilled subversions of pop-culture images ; one showed John Travolta and Samuel L Jackson in a famous pose from Pulp Fiction , with their guns replaced by bananas .
What did it mean ?
Something to do with the glamourisation of violence , yeah ?
Never mind .
It looked cool .
Most importantly , it was accompanied by the name " BANKSY " in huge letters , so everyone knew who 'd done it .
This , of course , is the real message behind all of Banksy 's work , despite any appearances to the contrary .
Take his political stuff .
One featured that Vietnamese girl who had her clothes napalmed off .
Ho -hum , a familiar image , you think .
I 'll just be on my way to my 9 to 5 desk job , mindless drone that I am .
Then , with an astonished lurch , you notice sly , subversive genius Banksy has stencilled Mickey Mouse and Ronald McDonald either side of her .
Wham !
The message hits you like a lead bus : America ... um ... war ... er ... Disney ... and stuff .
Wow .
In an instant , your worldview changes forever .
Your eyes are opened .
Staggering away , mind blown , you flick v-signs at a Burger King on the way home .
Nice one Banksy !
You 've shown us the truth , yeah ?
As if that was n't irritating enough , Banksy 's vague , pseudo - subversive preaching is often accompanied by a downright embarrassing hardnut swagger .
His website is full of advice to other would - be graffiti bores , like : " be aware that going on a mission drunk out of your head will result in some truly spectacular artwork and at least one night in the cells " .
Woah , man - the cells !
He goes on to explain that " real villains " think graffiti is pointless - not because he wants you to agree with them , but because he wants you to know he 's mates with a few tough - guy criminal types .
Coz Banksy's an anarchalist what do n't respect no law , innit ?
One of his most imbecilic daubings depicts a monkey wearing a sandwich board with " lying to the police is never wrong " written on it .
So presumably Ian Huntley was right then , Banksy ?
You absolute thundering backside .
Recently , our hero's made headlines by sneaking a dummy dressed in Guantánamo rags into Disneyland ( once again fearlessly exposing Mickey Mouse 's disgusting war criminal past ) , and defacing several hundred copies of Paris Hilton 's new album ( I have n't heard her CD , but I 'm willing to bet it 's far superior to Blur 's godawful Think Tank , a useless bumdrizzle of an album , whose artwork was done by Banksy - presumably he spray - painted it on a brick and hurled it through EMI 's window , yeah ? ) .
Right now you can see some of Banksy 's life - altering acts of genius for yourself at his LA exhibition Barely Legal ( yeah ?
Yeah ! ) , including a live elephant painted to blend in with some gaudy wallpaper .
This apparently represents " the big issues some people choose to ignore " - ie pretty much anything from global poverty to Aids .
But not , presumably , the fat - arsed , berk - pleasing rubbishness of Banksy .
We 're all keeping schtum about that one .

The design will sleep two people
James Dunlop , 23 , came up with a prototype during his final year at the University of the West of England .
He said he got the idea after hearing about the large number of abandoned tents at Glastonbury Festival .
Mr Dunlop hopes to test his design for a two - person tent later this year before it is marketed in 2008 .
' Design award '
His waterproof cardboard shelter , called Myhab , won an award at the annual New Designers ' Exhibition after Mr Dunlop graduated from his product design degree last year .
He said waste managers at Glastonbury Festival had told him one of their biggest problems is discarded tents .
" People use and abuse their tents because they are so cheap , " he said .
" They are just tired and want to go home after festivals .
They do not want to mess about putting their tent away . "
A spokeswoman for the Glastonbury Festival said where possible abandoned tents are recycled or given to charity .
The finance group Mint Equity has provided the funding in return for a 30 % stake in his idea .
2K Games and FIRAXIS have announced that Civilization 4 will be shipping in October , more or less confirming the early shipping time I told you about back in July .
They 've not narrowed down a more definite date , but when I hear of it , I 'll be sure to let everyone know .
They 've also announced a special pre-order edition of the game , which nabs you plenty of goodies .
Shipping on the same day as the regular version of the game , the Sid Meier 's Civilization IV Pre-Order Edition will feature : collector 's packaging , a CD soundtrack of the game , a keyboard template , a tech tree map and a spiral bound version of the manual .
The Pre-Order Edition will be offered through participating retailers while supplies last .
Not too shabby .
I can tell you this much , October is going to be a great month for world domination types .
Not only will we have Civ IV , but Rome : Total War - Barbarian
Invasion will be coming out , as well as Age of Empires 3 .
A word of caution : right now there are a few " pre-orders " out there , but none of them seem to be aware of this special edition .
I 'd hold off on orders for the time being .
About Dumb Little Man
It all started with a boy and his blogging dream …
Ok .
No .
Not really .
Not really at all actually .
My pen name is Jay White and one night in 2006 , I was putting together a sales presentation .
When done ( around 2AM ) I opened a beer and started playing with Blogger , the free blog platform that this site was built on .
To this day , I ’m not sure where the name Dumb Little Man came from .
Maybe I ’ll get analyzed one day by a team of psychiatrists to find out .
What I do know is that I have always been into productivity , exceeding goals , automation , and , well , finding a simpler way for everything .
In this blog ’s infancy , I would share sites and resources that I found helpful , etc .
As my sales career expanded and my writing time diminished , I had a tough choice : either close DLM or accept that you , the audience has something substantial to share .
I quickly decided that sharing info trumped the ego boost of being the sole writer on DLM .
There simply is no master of everything so there is no value in claiming to be one .
Therefore , I opened the door and now allow great writers and experts to share stories or publish tips and advice .
To me , this has been a phenomenal windfall of ideas and concepts that I would have never thought of .
To date , over 17 million people have stopped by Dumb Little Man and I ’d like to think that most learned something .
I am proud to announce that in June 2013 , our humble little blog joined the Caputo Media network .
By becoming a member of this network , we are now able to enjoy additional resources that were beyond our reach in the past .
But not to worry , I continue to run the Dumb Little Man day to day operations in the same fashion as I always have , and do n’t intend on stopping and time soon .
So , with that , I will thank you for stopping by .
I hope that you learned something during your visit and if so , let me know by actively participating in the comment section .
Feel free to send me topics you ’d like to see covered , questions you have , gripes , etc .
I ’d love to hear from you and there are a lot of ways to reach me : Facebook , Instagram , Google + , Twitter , LinkedIn
Warm Regards ,
Jay White
The producer tells her sad story with her fists curled inside the sleeves of an oversize hooded sweatshirt : " I 'm , like , losing my job , and maybe I , like , need that money for my family or something . "
The cause of her consternation : peer - to - peer file - sharing , which she says is devastating Hollywood .
The " producer " does n't produce movies any more than the " actor " or " singer " sitting beside her acts or sings .
They are all seventh - graders at Sierra Vista Junior High in Southern California 's Santa Clarita Valley .
They 're engaged in a role - playing game , as directed in a lesson plan sponsored and bankrolled by the Motion Picture Association of America .
The curriculum - called " What 's the Diff ? : A Guide to Digital Citizenship " - has reached slightly more than half a million junior high students since it began this school year .
The class is led by Jean Sutton , a volunteer from Junior Achievement , a nonprofit business education group .
She hands each student a card that explains what role they are to play - actor , director , producer , singer , computer user , or set builder - and what their viewpoint is supposed to be .
" It 's good you have your own opinions , " Sutton tells them .
" But I want you to do the activity based on what the little piece of paper says . "
Five of the pieces assert that file - sharing is unequivocally immoral .
" Illegal file - swapping has turned my dreams into nightmares , " reads the singer 's card .
" When people illegally download , they are stealing from my family and me , " reads the set builder's .
The single counterpoint is represented by the computer user .
He defends file - sharing largely on the grounds that he wo n't get caught : " Last time I checked , the Internet police did n't exist . "
The activity seems less a role - playing exercise than a regurgitation .
Sutton asks each student " why file - swapping 's such a big deal . "
The kids gamely paraphrase from their squares of paper .
" The directors do n't get paid when the people download movies , " says a director .
" If only , like , one person is buying the movie and everyone else is copying it , the people in the movies can't , like , make the set things , " says a set builder .
" It 's costing me , like , big bucks because people , like , download them instead of buying them , " says a producer .
The children , most from the middle - class suburb of Santa Clarita , participate enthusiastically and do n't appear troubled , or even bored , by the rote nature of the exercise .
" What 's the Diff ? " got its start when the MPAA , the trade group representing Hollywood studios , approached Junior Achievement with $ 100,000 and a notion to get its ideas about the ethics of file - sharing into the classroom .
It was written by JA staffers and consultants in close communication with Craig Hoffman , the director of corporate communications at Warner Bros.
Entertainment .
The point of the program , says MPAA spokesperson Rich Taylor , is for " students to reach their own conclusions about being a good digital citizen . "
The real point , of course , is to protect Hollywood from the fate of the record industry .
While the music business has already suffered from file - sharing , the film industry has so far been largely unaffected .
In fact , according to an Adams Media Research report , Hollywood has seen revenue rise 27 percent in the same four - year period that the recording industry went into free fall .
So consider this a preemptive attack , a giant guilt trip on the file - sharing public .
Compared to the recording industry 's strategy to sue everyone in sight , " What 's the Diff ? " seems downright enlightened .
Critics are n't mollified .
The program presents a " tremendously one - sided view of copyright , " says Wendy Seltzer , a lawyer for the Electronic Frontier Foundation .
" There 's no balance ; it 's entirely corporate driven .
If anything , it 's an exercise in how efficiently you can brainwash students . "
Seltzer might be considerably less concerned had she sat in on a recent lesson at Commerce Middle School in a working - class neighborhood of Yonkers , New York .
As in Santa Clarita , the kids here read their stock responses , but unlike their Californian counterparts , they do it in a sullen monotone , as if reciting some musty poem .
Only the computer user , an animated wiseass in baggy jeans , delivers a passionate response .
" It 's not hurting anybody .
I 'm not selling it .
I 'm using it in my home . "
The other kids nod energetically at this , and hands shoot up throughout the room .
One boy says , " If the computer user is just downloading music , how are the carpenters who work on movie sets being hurt ? "
The other students regard this as irrefutable logic , and a chorus of " mm-hmm " and " that 's right " fills the room .
A confident , articulate girl in cornrows and too - tight jeans speaks up .
" Look , you preview what 's on the CD , and if you like it , you go out and buy the CD because you get a booklet and , like , extra stuff with it . "
This , whether she knows it or not , is exactly the argument that the major music labels are hearing from many of their own consultants .
As the class winds down , several kids say that downloading files from Kazaa is no different than borrowing a library book .
" After you get it , you 're just going to delete it anyway , " a boy says .
JA volunteer Evan Snyder , who 's good with the kids , gets a crafty look on his face .
" How is that different from me just borrowing a Ferrari from the dealership and just passing it around to my friends ? "
The girl in the cornrows snaps back , " Well , that 's fine !
You 're borrowing it !
As long as you give it back . "
The bell rings , and the students bustle into the well - worn hallways of their middle school .

A Google search for real - time haskell yields little of interest , which I suppose is n’t too surprising .
Haskell , if you ’re not familiar , is not just a pure functional language , but a lazy one .
On the surface , this makes it a dreadfully poor choice for a couple of reasons .
Haskell code tends to be slow .
I ’ve started using the Gentoo language shootout as my baseline for language comparisons — it seems fairly unbiased if nothing else — and with a few exceptions , Haskell just does n’t stack up well .
This is n’t too surprising : laziness adds overhead .
My mentioning performance might get the hardcore real - timers in a tiff — theoretically performance has nothing to do with real - time — but in the real world , real - time is typically either done in embedded situations where hardware resources are scarce , or else we ’re in a soft real - time situation playing pr0n , and speed is important .
Haskell code is unpredictable .
This is the biggest flaw in Haskell that Simon Peyton - Jones has offered ( that I ’m aware of ) .
When tracing through Java code , it ’s trivial to derive complexity , and even a rough gauge on absolute running time , just by glancing at the code .
Laziness takes this all away .
I ’ll talk about this in a later post perhaps .
Haskell is garbage collected .
It ’s that last point I want to talk about .
Garbage collection is typically not used in real - time systems , particularly hard real - time systems , for good reason .
Imagine writing the quintessential real - time example code — nuclear power plant code ; yes , I can dream — and you ’ve reserved your time slice , grabbed your mutex , and then the garbage collector decides to run for 400 ms .
Not cool .
For my CS 888 project , I think I ’m going to propose changing Haskell ’s garbage collector to provide a real - time interface .
Something along the lines of :
gcNextCollectionUpperBound :: IO Int
gcBound :: Int -> IO a -> IO a
The first function would give an upper bound on how long the next round of garbage collection would take ( in milliseconds ) .
The second function / combinator would execute a section of code , guaranteeing a bound on the amount of time garbage collection will take , such as :
do gcTime <- gcNextCollectionUpperBound
return $ gcBound ( gcTime + 200 ) do
requestTimeSlice ( gcTime + 200 )
mutex <- getMutex
doComputation
saveLives
giveUpMutex mutex
return answer
This way we ’re guaranteed that we complete saveLives before the garbage collector eats up all our time .
So that ’s about all I need for the interface ; all I need now is the implementation .
Yay , I ’m half done !
GHC ’s documentation on its garbage collector is a big weak , so I ’ll have to dig into the source .
My understanding through a bit of reading is that right now GHC uses a hybrid system , with almost all programs using the copy collector exclusively , and the other part of the system being a generational collector .
This is somewhat exciting because I have n’t found any papers yet discussing real - time copy collector systems yet .
We ’ll see how far I get in this .
The nice thing about a project like this is that a naïve implementation can be done hopefully without too much work ( do garbage collecting until you run out of time , then just give up ) .
Even coming up with a naïve upper bound is easy ( return INT_MAX ) .
But the project offers itself to putting effort into a more finessed solution , too .
I do n’t know , we ’ll see what Watt says about it .

New Orleans held a parade for Martin Luther King Day
On Monday , Mr Nagin had said God must be " mad at America ... for being in Iraq under false pretences " .
However , outrage forced a retraction , and he described some of his remarks as " totally inappropriate " .
He also said he had not meant to offend anyone with his call for New Orleans to be a " chocolate " - or black - city .
Mr Nagin , who is black , said he had merely meant to convey that blacks were a key part of New Orleans ' history and culture , and should be encouraged to return .
' Everybody welcome '
On Monday , Mr Nagin told an audience on Martin Luther King Day that God was angry at the US for the Iraq war .
" Surely God is mad at America .
He sent us hurricane after hurricane after hurricane , and it 's destroyed and put stress on this country , " Mr Nagin said .
" Surely he does n't approve of us being in Iraq under false pretences .
" But surely he is upset at black America also .
We 're not taking care of ourselves . "
He also said that New Orleans must be a mostly black city again because " it 's the way God wants it to be " .
" This city will be chocolate at the end of the day , " he said .
On Tuesday , Mr Nagin said his comments about God were inappropriate and he needed " to be more sensitive and more aware " of what he was saying .
" I want everybody to be welcome in New Orleans - black , white , Hispanic , Asian - because that 's the kind of city that we deserve going forward , " he said .
Mr Nagin added that he had also hoped to make the point that when blacks did return , they should work to stamp out the crime and political wrangling that had held them back .
New Orleans was about two - thirds black before Hurricane Katrina drove many residents to flee last year , and some fear that planned reconstruction will not encourage poor residents to return home .
' Jaws dropping '
The mayor has made a number of outspoken comments since last August 's hurricane .
He is seeking re-election in polls scheduled for April .
A New Orleans city councillor said earlier that " everybody 's jaws are dropping " at his remarks on Monday .
" Who really cares what the racial make - up of the city is as long as it works for everybody ? "
Oliver Thomas asked rhetorically .
Only a fifth of the city 's population of half a million has returned since the mass evacuations in the wake of the 29 August hurricane and subsequent flooding .
Most people are living in areas that did not suffer flood damage and where services have been restored , yet vast swathes of the city hit by deep flooding are still without power .
There is no suggestion that the myriad connections between the administration of President Bush and Enron were illegal .
The corporation had close relations with many Democrats and Republicans in Congress .
Links exist between Enron and the current administration at all levels – personal , social , financial , professional and political .
Political rivals of President Bush have said , however , that the sheer volume of links between the administration and Enron may build up a highly damaging perception of guilt by association .
According to reports , 35 administration officials have held Enron stock – some had six figure investments .
Several , less senior officials , have served as paid consultants for Enron .
The White House has given lawmakers access to thousands of pages of secret documents relating to Enron .

Once upon a time Howie had a god .
It lived in the kennel where Juniper the mongrel had stayed until he died the winter before .
Howie 's mom Sophie was of the opinion that a pet god represented better value for money .
After all , it did n't wake you up barking whenever the postwoman came by .
And you did n't have to have a licence for one , either .
Howie was inconsolable when Juniper died .
They 'd grown up together , been playmates for all of Howie 's twelve years , and though Howie never did learn to wag his tail -- or Juniper to to do his sums -- they understood one another perfectly .
He sobbed and wailed and wept rivers when Juniper was run over , and sulked all March until Fred Phillips said to his wife , " Do n't you think it 's about time we got something to replace Juniper ? "
Sophie Phillips rolled her eyes .
" Pooper - scooper , she muttered ; flea powder , bath time , walks in the rain .
Are you crazy ? "
Do not be decieved ; it was n't that Sophie did n't like animals .
She loved them ; she 'd been so crazy about Juniper that having to take him to the vet had broken her heart .
It was n't the worming and the whining that worried her , but the thought of going through the trauma of the accident again .
Her husband realised this , and being who he was he waited impatiently until she pushed her reading glasses up the bridge of her nose with one finger , and -- knowing that at such a moment she would be distracted enough to pay full attention -- he asked the fateful question ; " Yes , but why do n't we get him something else ?
A god , for instance ? "
Sophie looked at him questioningly , and in that moment of locked gazes they thought with one mind : and their thought was this .
Hounds die on you , hounds need toilet training , hounds mean hassle ; but household gods are trouble - free .
What could go wrong with a minor deity ?
She nodded significantly .
" I think it 's time we went for a little drive , " she said , looking at Howie .
Howie 's eyes were downcast as he dug his spoon into his shreddies with a desultory action perfected long ages ago in the salt mines ;
Fred cleared his throat loudly , and Howie looked up .
" Your mother was speaking to you , said Fred .
What do you say ? "
" Aw ... what ? "
Howie spooned another mouthful of cereal , playing for time .
Sophie smiled tenderly at him .
Fred was of the opinion that she spoiled Howie silly but he kept his mouth shut .
Sophie had a degree in child psychology and Fred was in awe of it .
" Your mother said something , " he repeated .
Howie shifted his gaze from the direction of the demonic abyss -- which lay somewhere below the floor of his cereal bowl and somewhere above the planes of Hades , according to the Dungeons and Dragons book he'd got for Christmas -- and refocussed on Mom 's face .
" Yo ? " he asked , with all the charm and tact of a pre-teen bulldozer .
My , but they grow up fast these days , Mom thought admiringly , looking forward to adolescent sulks and no need to have to work at bringing him up any more .
" We 're going for a little drive , she said brightly ; your father and I agreed that it would be a good idea .
It 's about time , after all .
Since Juniper ... "
" What ? "
Howie looked at her , spoon poised in mid air .
A thin trickle of dirty milk dribbled back into his bowl as his hand sagged under the weight of his curiosity .
" It 's time we took you to temple , " said Mom .
" We 're going to buy you a God . "
You sell pets through a pet shop , but for Gods you have to go to Temple .
Temple was downtown , a sprawling great drive - in cathedral city that stank of incense and resounded with the noise of striking gongs , booming drums , chanting acolytes -- recorded , of course -- and human sacrifice .
The complex sprawled because you have to keep gods well apart .
Being fiercely territorial , gods tend to fight violently and utter the most fearsome curses on sight of a potential rival ; and besides , real estate was cheap downtown .
They 'd built minarets up either side of the entrance boulevard -- very phallic , Sophie thought -- and as she pulled the Toyota up at the gatehouse she shook her head and tut - tutted quietly to herself .
Terrible , she thought , exposing little boys to such oedipal archetypes !
What can the architect have been thinking of ?
" Hiya , " she called , head half out of the window ; " Sophie Phillips and family .
I phoned ahead , remember ? "
" Pleased to meet you ma'am ! " said the bronzed , grinning gatekeeper .
" If you 'd like to wait just a second we 'll have one of our salesmen join you for your journey round our complex . "
He glanced over his shoulder .
" Moon , " he hissed .
The smile slipped back into place with just a seconds ' hesitation .
" Minister Moon will be joining you presently , ma'am . "
A door beside the window opened and a butterball oriental stepped out , face all glowing teeth and sunglasses above his hawaiian shirt .
He walked round the car and Sophie unlocked one of the passenger doors .
" Glad to meet you ma'am , name 's Sunny Moon , but you can call me Sunny if you want !
Hope you enjoy your visit here , have a nice day as well , " he added , glancing nervously at her .
Something about women in mirrorshades gave him a funny turn .
He sat down gingerly on the other side of the back seat to Howie , who cast him a long , cool stare .
Sophie nodded at the gatekeeper and slid the Buick into gear ; then she moved off along the driveway .
" Here on your right we see the temple of the old Egyptian pantheon , " Moon began , launching into his spiel .
It was a huge , sand - weathered pyramid fronted by a temple .
" All the way from Thoth the ibis - headed , especially good with academics and those interested in learning , to Osiris , god of the dead and judge of souls .
Actually he 's a bit patchy -- ever since his rival
Set chopped him into lots of little pieces and lost them all over the Upper Nile .
Tell the truth , " Moon added confidentially , " I would n't recommend any of this mob to you ; they 're a bit clannish and you 'll end up with heiroglyphics all over the bathroom walls and stacks of mummified cats in the cellar . "
He shut up as Mom nodded and drove on ; like many a salesman before him , Moon had mastered the art of sizing up his client and was seducing her with his apparent objectivity before the Big Sell .
" Over there we see Valhalla , hall of dead heroes and home of the Norse deities .
This lot are especially good with Scandinavian buyers , but they do tend to drink a lot and party at odd hours .
Midnight sun , you know .
We had a few Hells Angels the other week who seemed to think Loki would make a good mascot for their chapter , but they got kind of annoyed when he cheated at pool .
Anyway . "
Sophie Phillips drove on , even when the road curled around an outrageous nipple - shaped protrusion covered in the most intricate mosaics .
" Here we have one of the more abstract deities , a kind of second cousin to that Jewish Big God Person .
You can't actually see him but if you adopt him you get to lead a horde of millions of fanatical followers .
He 's big on marriage -- you can have up to four wives -- " he looked at Sophie and backtracked hastily " -- but you get your right hand chopped off for drinking and you have to pray to him five times a day . "
Mom glanced at him in the mirror and nodded , very slightly , as they drove on ; Moon sweated .
Howie slumped in the back seat , bored .
" Actually , most of the deities in this quadrant are a bit abstract for a kid , " Moon chattered .
" I 'd think a young man like your son " -- he actually looked at Howie for the first time since getting into the car -- " would be more interested in something he could sort of relate to on a personal level .
Now over here -- yeah , you want to take this left fork and carry on there , yes , into the tunnel -- we have a special deal this week .
This is where we keep the Elder Gods .
It 's not so much that they 're old stock as that most people want , well , something more familiar . "
Sophie Phillips , to whom the words more familiar translated as more expensive , sat up straighter .
The road disappeared into a hole in the ground , dropping smoothly until the raw stone arched overhead and covered them .
There were no lamps ; she switched the headlights on as she drove .
The walls seemed to glisten with an invisible sheen of sweat , as if the weight above them was squeezing blood from the stones .
This tunnel did n't look like a recent excavation ; more like an ancient , dank , brooding gateway into some isolated network of caverns that had threaded the rocks under New England since long before European settlers first trod these shores .
She removed her glasses , looked about , and sniffed .
Birth tunnel experience , she thought .
How Freudian can you get ?
Moon , who had been silent for a few blissful moments , picked up his sales - pitch again .
" Folks , you are now about to see the Elder Gods .
This bunch are rather less sociably acceptable than some , they tend to slobber a bit and you 've got to take care not to let them on the carpet .
That said , an Elder God can make a faithful pet , an obedient servant , and a lifetime companion .
Keep 'em somewhere shady in the back yard and water it when it does n't rain .
You wo n't get any trouble from rats or mice while you 've got an Old One on the premises , and -- "
He shut up as Sophie hit the brakes .
The tunnel debouched into a monstrous cavern , the centre of which was occupied by a circular black pool .
Dark tunnel - mouths led off in all directions .
The halogen glare of the headlights cast great shadows which imparted an air of instant , brooding menace to the turbid waters that lapped at the nearside tyres .
Something about the pool spoke of ancient evil , of things left undisturbed since before the dawn of time , of an aura of necrotic decay that accounted for the stillness of the air in some bizarre , twisted manner .
" Kill the lights " , said Moon .
Sophie complied .
The darkness was not complete ; overhead a myriad of toadstools cast their ghastly luminescence across the surface of the pond , reflecting like distant , unnameably ancient stars in a cosmos no human eye was meant to see .
Moon wound down the window .
" Cthulhu ! " he roared .
" Here Boy ! Fish ! "
Reaching into a pocket he pulled out something that glistened faintly in the ghost - light .
He cast it far out into the pool , where it sank with a sickly plop that spread no ripples on the surface .
" Squid " , he whispered by way of explanation ; " always brings him . "
Fred clutched at Sophie 's arm .
" Is this wise ? " he ventured .
" I mean , if anything happened ... "
" No problem ! " she answered determinedly .
" They 're chicken , are gods .
Ca n't stand up to a determined atheist , not a - one of them .
You 'll see ! "
Howie sat up attentively and looked out the window .
A smile began to tug at his lips ; a smile of anticipation .
A ripple appeared on the surface of the lake , a ripple which rapidly grew wider and higher as if some unspeakable bulk was rising up from a slumber of aeons , deep on the floor of some miles - deep rift in the continental bedrock .
There was an ominous breeze blowing , as if the very air was being displaced from the cavern ; then something , shapeless and huge , monstrous beyond belief and twice as ugly , began to rear itself from the centre of the lake .
Howie gaped at it in frank adoration .
Sophie took one look in her mirror and changed her mind .
" Big sucker , is n't he ? " she said ; " bet there is n't room for him in our fishpond ! "
She slipped the Buick into gear with a jolt , and they disappeared off up the next side tunnel with Howie still struggling to control his disappointment .
Behind them , Cthulhu continued his monumental rise from his far - drowned bed .
His spine was so tall that it took whole minutes for a command to travel the length of all those synapses ; he often took so long to stop sitting up that he bumped his head on the ceiling .
He saw twin red lights vanishing up a tunnel that his memory said led to the abode of his cousin Shub - Niggurath .
Ponderously he swung his oversized , misshapen abomination of a head to look after them ; tentacles drooped and squirmed from his pulp y lower lip as he examined Moon 's squid , clutched in one unspeakable appendage .
He shook his head .
So long , he rumbled ; cheapskates !
Eventually Sophie and Fred bargained their prodigal down to one -- just one -- child of the unspeakable Shub - Niggurath , father of the woods and eternal spawner of obscene life forms in his root - roofed cavern beneath the rolling green hillsides around Arkham City .
It took dire threats and the promise of fish for supper every night for a week to forestall the promised tantrum and flood of tears that greeted Sophie 's outright refusal to countenance a Cthulhu .
Fred even threatened to buy Howie a beaming fat Buddha if he did n't behave himself ; this latter threat seemed to do the trick .
" That 's cute , " he spat as if the very suggestion brought images of saintly abstinence to mind .
" Here 's your very own user - manual , " said Moon , beaming as he handed Howie a leatherbound copy of the Necronomicon ; " remember , Old Ones do n't like sunlight , they need a plentiful supply of water and a bit of fresh blood from time to time , and do n't let it get at the neighbours ' daughter .
You know , the girl next door ?
Good boy !
Have a nice day ! "
He continued beaming even as the sweating porters levered the tarpaulin - draped crate into the back of the car and Sophie signed the Amex voucher .
His smile only slipped when he saw the happy family drive away .
He shook his head dolefully .
" There goes another one , Ron , he said .
Misers do n't wanna know about the big stuff ... "
" Well hell , ya got to hand it to them , " said Ron , propping his feet up on the desk and putting down his pen -- Ron fancied himself as a writer of science fiction -- " at least they took it off of our hands !
Now you --" he jabbed his fingers at Moon -- " when 're you gonna take advantage of our staff discount scheme ? "
He winked , an affected nautical mannerism that irritated the hell out of Moon .
Moon considered .
" Well , there 's this contemporary goddess I 've been thinking about recently , " he said .
" Name of Norma Jean ... "
The Phillips family arrived home and the installation of Shub- junior -- or Junior as he rapidly became known -- proceeded smoothly .
Juniper 's kennel was the obvious home , given Junior 's glutinous propensities , and Fred insisted that Mom lay down the law before Howie could go play with his new pet .
" Remember , " said Mom , finger poised before her face ; " Junior 's not to get on the carpet !
Your Dad will have a fit if he sees goop all over the staircase , and he 's not allowed in the kitchen either .
You 'll have to walk him at night ; and remember you must n't pray to him .
That 's almost as bad as sacrificing . "
" Why can't I pray to him if I want to ? " demanded Howie , staring up at Sophie and trying to figure what Junior would make of his new red skateboard .
" You mus n't ever worship a God , " she said ; " it 's very important .
If you worship them they get more and more powerful until they start telling you to do unreasonable things .
Once everybody worshipped their gods , and things were really bad .
Only now we know better . "
She grinned with satisfaction , speculating about her son's need for a pre-adolescent bonding ritual .
Howie picked his nose , deeply puzzled .
Surely you needed two legs to balance on a skateboard ..?
" Yes , but if I can't worship my very own god , what can I pray to ? " he asked .
" Conspicuous consumption , " said Fred , backing into the kitchen with a heap of frozen microwave apple pies on a tray .
" Gods all promise jam tomorrow ; at least this way you get to have your cake and eat it ! "
He laughed as he tied on his apron .
" You just go play with your deity , " he said .
" Lunch in twenty , right ? "
After their first ecstatic bonding , Howie and Junior were was as inseperable as any boy and god could be .
On many summer evenings you could look outside after dusk and see the two of them bounding along the sidewalk , Howie weaving his skateboard from side to side and Junior racing to and fro across front lawns , gibbering and leaving a thin trail of slime in his efforts to keep up .
Sometimes they swapped , and Howie would jog along huffing and puffing while Junior rumbled after him on the ' board .
As they passed the neat white picket fences lining the road , hounds would bark frantically and cats would spit from the cover of bushes ; but Howie did n't care .
At school he would look at his fellow fifth - graders with a gleam in his eye ; I bet your pet can't ride a skate board , he would sneer to himself .
And it was true .
This was a small town , and skateboarding elder gods were as thin on the ground as hang - gliding rabbis .
The summer recess stretched into a halcyon period of long , hot evenings and quiet , starlit nights .
Sometimes during the early hours , Howie would be awakened by the noise of scraping from the back yard .
Junior was quite smart for a deity , and had mastered the art of letting himself out whenever he felt like going for a midnight ramble .
He was always back by dawn though , and nobody mentioned the matter unless Junior was careless and left a manhole cover open by mistake .
But the year rolled on towards autumn , and that September Howie was due to start sixth grade .
He did n't want to go back to school -- Aw , mom , -- what kid does ?
But he had to .
" Look Howie , it 's nothing big , " Mom told him on the first morning of term .
" Everybody has to go through it .
Look at me -- I was at school once , you know ?
And look what it made of me ! "
Howie looked up at her through the wrong end of a conceptual telescope .
He was still of an age when cause and effect were confusing .
" But I do n't want to know all about Nietzche or Sartre , " he complained ; " they got funny names and Miz Jones laughs at me when I , when I --" he subsided into gasps of outrage at the very thought that he might mispronounce their names to entertaining effect .
" There , there ! " soothed Mom .
" You 'll see , it 's not that bad !
If you do n't learn about existential philosophy and logical positivism in school , how can you expect to earn a living in this world ?
What 'll you do when you grow up ? "
She picked him up and hugged him , grunting slightly with the effort -- Howie was turning into a big boy , just like his father -- and looked him in the eye .
" And do n't you worry about Miss Jones .
I 'm sure she does n't mean anything , but if she does ... well , your mom used to be a mud-wrestler , right ? "
She swung him in a loop until he laughed like crazy and struggled , then set him down again .
" Now eat your shreddies , dear !
Have you fed Junior today ? "
" Naw , " he said sullenly .
" Dad said he would . "
Anyway , it fell to Sophie to drive Howie to school and drop him off there with all the other kids .
Howie had by this time convinced himself that he was going to have an awful day , so indeed he did ; existentialism had nothing on his angst , which expressed itself to the full when Candy Jessup , who had freckles and red hair and a brace and sat behind him , tugged his pigtail when Miss Jones was n't looking .
It was a lesson about Descartes , so it probably did n't happen anyway .
Howie turned round and snarled at her , quietly and with awesome ferocity : " I 've got a skateboarding god who bites and I 'm going to set him on you after school , so there ! "
" Ooh . "
Candy screwed her face up around an ' O ' of a mouth and looked ever so faintly amused .
" Kiddie 's got a pet god , has he ?
Wanna put your god up against my pit bull terrier ? "
She grinned mockingly and Howie noticed some things about her ; mascara and lipstick and a black leather jacket .
Candy was growing up , already apeing her elders , and she hung out with a bunch of older girls .
He was about to come out with a crushing rejoinder when an iron pair of fingers clamped themselves to the back of his neck and forcibly rotated his head .
" And what have we got here ? " asked Miss Jones , in her Number Two ( scathing ) tone of voice .
" A silly -- shake -- little -- rattle -- boy , not paying attention in class ! "
Ouch .
Yes , very silly .
Howie looked up and Miss Jones looked down with all the concilliatory charm of a rattlesnake .
" And what have you got to say for yourself ? " she asked , the personification of steely retribution .
The room fell silent around her , for all the world loves an execution .
" Talking in class , idle chatter , and not paying attention .
Do you know what happens if you stop paying attention ? " she boomed .
Howie winced in anticipation .
" You stop existing ? " he asked hesitantly .
Thwack !
came the sound of a smart clip round the ear .
" Guess again " , Miss Jones said drily as she returned to the front of the class and retrieved her chalk .
" Now as I was saying ... "
The day dragged on into dystopian distemper for Howie , and when the bell finally rang he ran out into the afternoon sunlight as fast as he could .
That was a mistake .
Candy 's gang was hanging out just past the gate , and they were all there waiting for him ; Bernice and Lilly the Pink and Tarantula deVille who was heavily into black lace and studs ; and the big , sullen one they all called Helen J. Uh oh , he thought , but he was n't tempted to repeat his solipsistic experiment out here , not after his disastrous failure to dispell Miss Jones that morning .
He steeled himself as he walked towards them .
" Hiya kiddy , " shouted Candy .
" Think I do n't exist , huh ? "
Oh shit , he thought .
I think , therefore I 'm not here ...
" Yeah , kid , " drawled Bernice , crop haired number two to Candy 's El Presidente pose , she who was by right lawful custodian of the gang ghetto blaster which even now perched upon a wall , overloading with transients from something ominously hardcore ; " you wanna mess with us ? "
She pushed herself away from the wall with a swing of her ample hips and shambled towards him like a great irritated bear .
Tarantula deVille leered at him and went back to preening long black fingernails that glinted ominously in the sunlight .
" You and whose army ? "
Howie swore , looking round desperately .
There at the other end of the street was mom's Buick , rounding the corner with light gleaming from the chrome .
" Hey , gotta go , " he sang out ; " ' less you want my mom to jump on you ! "
He turned and sped across the road .
If wishes were fishes , he ruminated , his dinner 'd be awfully boring .
It was dad behind the steering wheel .
" Your mom 's going to be home late , " he said brightly as they pulled away from the turbulent stormclouds of adolescent experience .
" She 's staying over at the office ; there 's some kind of problem come up . "
" Uh - huh , " said Howie , musing on his close escape .
Dad drove on , chopping lanes and booting the gas pedal as if a politician was after his vote .
" Howie , " he said presently , " was that a bunch of girls I saw you playing with just then ? "
" Uh - huh , " he replied .
Dad cleared his throat ; " How many times have I told you ... " he changed track ... " what will all the other boys in class say ?
Do you want them to think you 're interested in girls ? "
Howie , who did want them to think that ( because it was a kind of grown - up thing to do ) , and who was n't about to tell Dad of all people just what he'd been doing with those girls -- or about to have had done to him -- kept his mouth zipped .
" Aw , Dad , " he whined .
" Do n't you aw Dad me , young man , " said Fred , who was bitterly afraid that Howie was going to disappoint him .
His knuckles whitened on the steering wheel at the thought of Howie growing his hair long and having his ears pierced and enslaving himself voluntarily before the juggernaut of bizarre fashions , all in the interests of catching a member of the opposite sex .
" It 's not healthy , Howie .
If you go on like this your mom is going to have to take you to see the doctor , you know that ?
You naughty boy !
And at your age too ! "
He resolved to talk to Mom about this , later , in private .
Howie rolled his eyes but kept quiet .
When they got home Dad made it obvious that he was in the doghouse , so he went into the backyard to relate to Junior .
He curled up in the corner of the kennel and Junior leaned up against him and gibbered affectionately to the beat of his cassette player .
Howie ran fingers through his slimy palps and toyed with one of his longer tentacles until Junior rolled over and presented his dryish tongue to be scratched , but nothing Junior did could shift his master 's depression .
Eventually the tape came to the end , so Howie flipped sides and pressed playback before Junior could sit up and beg ; he seemed to have a thing about the Dead Kennedys , which was okay by Howie .
" It 's awful , " he sighed .
" Miss Jones wo n't go away if I ignore her , whatever she says , and Candy pulled my pigtail and was horrible to me and her gang 're going to beat me up and what 'm ' I ' goin ' to DO , Junior ?
Answer me that , mm ?
Gonna get stomped by girls and Dad thinks I 'm hanging around and I 'm unhappy .
Watcha gonna do ? "
Burble , said Junior .
Now Howie had listened when mom told him why not to pray to Junior , but it seemed to him that if he ever needed a friend it was now .
Mom did n't take him to the doctor , but bottles of little white pills appeared in the bathroom cabinet and she kept after him with injunctions to keep taking his vitamins so he'd grow up to be a big boy .
Howie did -- all the way to Junior , who developed quite a taste for stanozolol and androsterone .
Howie stopped hanging about late and taking his time leaving school , so even though Candy carried on pulling his pigtail and whispering obscene , lascivious suggestions in his ear when Miss Jones was n't looking he did n't get beat up .
Not yet , anyway .
When they'd bought him , Junior had been about the size of a large terrier .
He was growing large on a diet of red meat , anabolic steroids and prayer .
He slept with his tentacles in the open air , twitching faintly as he dreamed of whatever it is Elder Ones dream of ; on more and more nights he sneaked stealthily out of his kennel and down the manholes , until the public health inspectors came to look at the sewers and scratched their heads in wonder and pronounced the town rat - free for the first time in living memory .
Mom had to get out her saw and enlarge the kennel opening .
" He just growed , " Howie confided to his friends at school -- ' Fingers ' Freddy and The Worm , who oohed and aahed appreciatively .
Neither of them had a god , although The Worm had a pet snake which spent most of its time asleep and did n't notice if you prayed to it .
It did n't grow either , nor did it gibber at the full moon and rattle its tentacles on the picket fences when it went skateboarding with Howie .
Howie had an old walkman from when he was a kid , and he rigged it so that the headphones fit a couple of Junior 's orofices -- whether they were ears or not he was n't certain , but they sure looked funny and Junior seemed to like it -- so that he could listen to the Dead Kennedys as he rolled down the sidewalk on his red skateboard .
Yes , even if Howie was unhappy and uncertain at school his pet god was doing just fine ; he even had a worshipper , and what more can any self - respecting deity ask than that ?
( Lots , actually . )
As autumn wore on , the nights grew longer .
Candy tormented him intermittently , asked him to go out with her then had a good laugh at him with her gang when he refused out of knock - kneed terror .
Going out with her , while not a totally repulsive prospect , would expose him to the Gang ... and girls in gangs are utterly different to girls on their own .
So she continued to pull his pigtail in class -- almost coyly , as if to retain his interest -- and hang out downtown at night .
Late one afternoon , Miss Stead -- who was , if anything , more fearsome than Miss Jones -- lectured them about the evils of logical positivism .
She closed her big textbook with a thud and a spurt of dust , just as the bell rang .
" Now go and be good children and read chapter seven before your next lesson , all of you ! " she said .
" And remember that the test next Tuesday will cover Bertrand Russell and the post - Godelian numerotheologists ! "
Candy yawned elaborately behind Howie : who did n't look round , so he did n't see that her brace had emigrated to leave a spotless bite and sultry lips that could have graced a film star .
He packed his books and stood up , then Candy grabbed him from behind .
" Hey ! " he protested .
" Yeah ? " she said .
" You a kiddy , kiddy ?
Or are you a man ? "
" I'm a boy ! " he protested hotly .
" I 'll set my god on you --"
" Good , " she said , tightening her grip round his throat playfully .
" You wanna go to the pictures tonight ? "
" I gotta walk Junior , " he gasped .
" Aw , fuck . "
She pronounced it with the breathless reverence of one who had just discovered what the word meant and wondered if it was fun .
" You 're no good , Kiddy .
Hey , I betcha you do n't so have a god , anyway ! "
She let go of his throat and stepped back .
" I do too , " he said trenchantly .
" I pray to it as well ! "
" Yoo hoo ! " she whistled sarcastically .
" A real gawd .
You going to show me , kiddy ? "
" If you want . "
Sullen now , Howie was beginning to see how this short - haired freckle - faced imp had outmanoeuvred him .
" Okay , " she said .
" See you tonight , right ?
Out by Fat Mac's . "
" Hey , ah , " he said , but she 'd already gone , doubtless to tell her gang to be there or be square to see her seduce him or something ghastly .
What was he going to do ?
His mind boggled .
That evening saw Howie in a real tizzy .
He fiddled and put in his best earrings and pulled on his best levis and running shoes .
Then he got out the skateboard and Junior obligingly hopped on and waited while Howie put on his headphones .
" You 're going to behave now , you hear me ? "
Howie prayed .
" And everything 's going to be right , right , ' cos you 're going to make it right , right ?
A - men ! "
He pressed the play button and Junior belched to the beat of Holiday in Cambodia , rocked to Kalifornia Uber Alles , and waved his tentacles as Howie towed him out onto the sidewalk .
In the dim light he seemed to glow with the repressed energy of prayers and steroids , vibrating and shimmering at the edges as if his skateboard was surfing through extraplanar realities in a cosmos too vast and terrible for human senses to comprehend .
( Actually , Junior was surfing through an n-dimensional spatial construct .
Howie was lamentably blind to the cosmic influences of the higher planes ; to the snowflakes of light that whirled in an everlasting blizzard through the vast spaces of infinite insanity : and to the window into emptiness which the power of his prayer had opened .
Harmless in and of himself though Junior was , nevertheless something horrifying had been activated within his diminutive frame by the pernicious virus of belief .
Steroid - fed and anarchic , a spirit of pure evil was growing , pulsing in time to the punk rock overspill which Howie had unknowingly attached to some of Junior 's genitals in mistake for ears .
As he was to discover ...)
Candy and her gang were hanging out at the crossroads MacRonalds , stuffing their faces , when along the boulevard came the oddest sight any of them had ever seen .
It was n't so much the cute boy with the earings and blond hair and designer jeans that turned their heads -- although he got a wolf - whistle from Bernice -- but his companion who stunned them .
A large , quivering lump of tentacles , claws , palps , lubricious orofices and quivering eye stalks was rare enough on these mean streets .
To see this self - same lump riding a red perspex skateboard and listening to the Dead Kennedys on a walkman added a unique touch .
Jaws dropped ; fragments of masticated cow landed in the dirt , unnoticed .
" Shit " , breathed Candy , with the reverence of the truly surprised .
" Do you see where the headphones --" she stopped .
Unlike Howie she did n't need labels for labia .
" Do you believe it ? " drawled Tarantula deVille to her sister Mortitia , who 'd come along for the ride .
" The boy 's balling a ball ! " Mortitia sniggered knowingly , even though she was too young and naive to understand .
" Betcha he is n't , " said Candy , captivated .
The light of the setting sun sparkled fire through Howie 's hair , and she just knew that he was an innocent young thing waiting for the hot taste of her lips to awaken passionate desires supressed for too long by , by ... she shook her head , at a loss for adjectives .
" Here , take this , " she said , passing her hamburger remnants to Helen J. , who looked at them in deep disgust ( being a vegan ) .
She swaggered out into the road , hips swinging and cowboy boots clacking on the blacktop , to meet her paramour and rival .
" Hiya kiddy , " she said , chewing non-existent gum and looking him in the eye .
" Glad ya could make it .
Who 's this here friend o' yours ? "
Howie , for his part , stared at her , noticing for the first time that the brace was gone from her teeth , that her hair was short and extremely sexy , that he was male and she was n't , and that despite all his mothers ' conditioning ( ideologically sound in view of the population explosion ) he was still of heterosexual bent , and that his jeans were embarassingly tight .
" Uh , " he said .
Candy bent over Junior , who bounced up and down on the board menacingly and clacked his -- or rather , her -- claws together .
" Come on , " she said , do n't be coy !
" Who are you ? "
Gobble , said Junior ; grubble gurgle grunt snoo - oo - ork !
She bounced the front wheels of the board from side to side , nearly falling off it in her agitation .
" Hey , " said Howie , " I think you 've got Junior excited .
Now you 've seen him , what do you want ? "
" Well , " said Candy , swinging her hips suggestively , " you can come with me , hang out with the gang for a while , right ?
Maybe --" her eyes flickered from side to side -- " we could kiss .
You want to be my boyfriend ? "
" Ung , " said Howie , who had half - expected an invitation to be her punchbag .
Junior jumped up and down and the skateboard squeaked .
He seemed to be getting awfully indignant about something , Howie realized through the haze of his disconcertion .
" Come on , " coaxed Candy , taking his hand .
" Come this way ? "
Now the trouble was about to begin .
It was about to begin because of a single technical problem ; Howie 's walkman did n't have auto - reverse .
The tape had come to the end of the side , and Junior could hear everything .
( The fact that Howie 'd screwed the headphones into her genitals notwithstanding ; sensitive skin , y'know , picks up vibrations . )
Now it takes a lot to get an Elder God jealous , especially a very young , very inexperienced Elder God , but there 's one lesson that all Gods are born knowing , and that 's that once your worshippers get all starry - eyed and start making love all over the place you lose all hold over their guilt ; and without guilt , where is the motive for prayer ?
For obedience ?
Junior thought she was about to be jilted , with good reason .
And unlike a powerful Big God Person of days gone by , Junior had no priesthood to pronounce anathema upon the couple ; so she / he / it decided to take matters into his / her / it 's own claws / palps / tentacles .
Howie , entranced , turned his back upon Junior and revelled in the warm , tight grip of his very first girl - friend as she led him towards the lights and the company of her gang .
As they reached the kerb , she stopped suddenly and turned , so that he found himself walking into her open arms .
Surprise .
They closed around him -- so unlike the choke - grip of classroom days -- and he found his lips touching something soft and yielding and moist and utterly different that seemed to promise the future to him .
He did n't fight or struggle ; it was too much fun .
Mortitia , who was too young for this , looked away disgustedly while her big sister grinned carnivorously and stretched her black claws out to the couple .
Helen J. turned her back grumpily .
So it happened that only Bernice noticed the skateboarding punk - rocker of an Elder God on anabolic steroids who was accelerating ominously towards them from way back down the boulevard , sparks grating from the skateboard wheels , squatting in a kind of schuss position and gnashing her ominously long , needle - sharp teeth .
Junior glowed , glowed with the rage of a deity scorned , shone with the light of steroid - induced psychosis , the violent flare of martyrdom and a hundred bloody jihads as she rumbled down the street in a foaming of orofices and a clattering of lobster claws .
And as Junior glowed she grew , bulking higher and broader and more hideous by the moment until she filled the road with a rushing wall of darkness that blotted out the sky and the stars and the promise of rescue .
SPLAT !
" That was Junior , " said Howie , staring in disbelief at the enormous mass draped over the hood of the Mack truck that had been crossing the intersection at exactly the wrong time ; " my god ! "
" Well it sure as hell is n't any more , " said Candy pragmatically .
" It did n't look too friendly just then ! "
" Yeah , " said Howie , mouth still adroop and heart pummeling his ribs into submission .
" What d'you suppose got into him ? "
" A touch --" she goosed him -- " of jealousy .
Come on ? "
But Howie did n't move .
He looked at the mess in the road and shook his head .
" Do you believe it ? " he murmured to himself ; " there went my walkman and my best ole Dead Kennedys tape ! "
He shook his head again but , to his surprise , he did n't shed a tear .
Gods have always preyed on ignorance ; and Howie , as he turned his back on it , had more important things to think about .
Incan civilization was a technological marvel .
When the Spanish conquistadors arrived in 1532 , they found an empire that spanned nearly 3,000 miles , from present - day Ecuador to Chile , all served by a high - altitude road system that included 200 - foot suspension bridges built of woven reeds .
It was the Inca who constructed Machu Picchu , a cloud city terraced into a precarious stretch of earth hanging between two Andean peaks .
They even put together a kind of Bronze Age Internet , a system of messenger posts along the major roads .
In one day , Incan runners amped on coca leaves could relay news some 150 miles down the network .

Yet , if centuries of scholarship are to be believed , the Inca , whose rule began 2,000 years after Homer , never figured out how to write .
It 's an enigma known as the Inca paradox , and for nearly 500 years it has stood as one of the great historical puzzles of the Americas .
But now a Harvard anthropologist named Gary Urton may be close to untangling the mystery .
His quest revolves around strange , once - colorful bundles of knotted strings called khipu ( pronounced KEY - poo ) .
The Spanish invaders noticed the khipu soon after arriving but never understood their significance – or how they worked .
Once , at the beginning of the 17th century , a group of Spaniards traveling in the central Peruvian highlands east of modern - day Lima encountered an old Indian carrying khipu that he insisted held a record of " all [ the Spanish ] had done , both the good and the bad . "
Angered , the Spanish burned the man 's khipu , as they did countless others over the years .
Some of the knots did survive , though , and for centuries people wondered if the old man had been speaking the truth .
Then , in 1923 , an anthropologist named Leland Locke provided an answer :
The khipu were files .
Each knot represented a different number , arranged in a decimal system , and each bundle likely held census data or summarized the contents of storehouses .
Roughly a third of the existing khipu do n't follow the rules Locke identified , but he speculated that these " anomalous " khipu served some ceremonial or other function .
The mystery was considered more or less solved .
Then , in the early 1990s , Urton , one of the world 's leading Inca scholars , spotted several details that convinced him the khipu contained much more than tallies of llama sales .
For example , some knots are tied right over left , others left over right .
Urton came to think that this information must signal something .
Could the knotted strings also be a form of writing ?
In 2003 , Urton wrote a book outlining his theory , and in 2005 he published a paper in Science that showed how even khipu that follow Locke 's rules could include place - names as well as numbers .
Urton knew that these findings were a tiny part of cracking the code and that he needed the help of people with different skills .
So , early last year , he and a graduate student , Carrie Brezine , unveiled a computerized khipu database – a vast electronic repository that describes every knot on some 300 khipu in intricate detail .
Then Urton and Brezine brought in outside researchers who knew little about anthropology but a lot about mathematics .
Led by Belgian cryptographer Jean - Jacques Quisquater , they are now trying to shake meaning from the knots with a variety of pattern - finding algorithms , one based on a tool used to analyze long strings of DNA , the other similar to Google 's PageRank algorithm .
They 've already identified thousands of repeated knot sequences that suggest words or phrases .
Now the team is closing in on what might be a writing system so unusual that it remained hidden for centuries in plain sight .
If successful , the effort will rank with the deciphering of Egyptian hieroglyphics and will let Urton 's team rewrite history .
But how do you decipher something when it looks completely unlike any known written language – when you 're not even sure it has meaning at all ?
URTON WORKS A FEW MINUTES ' WALK from Harvard Yard , in a redbrick building with dark wooden doors and copper gutters that also serves as the university 's Museum of Natural History .
But his fifth - floor office is more Lima than Cambridge .
Behind his modest desk hangs a Peruvian pan flute .
Spanish - language posters adorn the walls .
The space is awash in earthy browns – straw - colored carpet , a darker shade for the faux - clay clock face – offset by colorful weavings hung from every wall .
Each object is a memento from his many trips to South America to track down khipu .
Today at least 750 khipu survive , scattered about in museums and private collections .
Each one has a long primary cord , typically about a quarter - inch in diameter , from which hang smaller " pendant " cords – sometimes just a couple , sometimes many hundred .
The pendant cords are tied in a series of neat , small knots .
Originally dyed in rich colors , the average khipu has now faded so much it resembles a dirty brown mop head .
How could the Inca have used strings to write ?
In a sense , any written text is just a record of physical actions .
You put a pen to paper and then choose from a prescribed set of options how to move and when to lift up .
Each decision is preserved in ink .
The same can be done with string .
The writer makes a series of decisions , recorded as a knot that can then be read by anyone who knows the rules .
Back in the ' 20s , Locke began with the observation that the Inca tied their khipu with three types of knots .
There is a " figure - eight " knot , which represents one of something .
There are " long " knots , with two to nine turns , representing those numbers .
And there are " single " knots , which represent tens , hundreds , thousands , or ten thousands , depending on where they fall on the string .
When a khipu is placed flat on the ground , the bottom row is the ones place and successively higher rows stand for higher places .
So , the number 327 would have three single knots in the hundreds place .
A little lower would be two single knots .
Lower still would be a long knot with seven turns .
Most anthropologists assumed that was all there was to it – until 1992 .
That 's when Urton spent a day looking at khipu in the American Museum of Natural History in New York with his friend Bill Conklin , an architect and textile expert .
As he studied the cords , Conklin had an is n't - that - funny insight :
The knots that connect the small pendant strings to the primary cord are always tied the same way , but sometimes they face forward and sometimes backward .
Startled , Urton soon noticed additional construction details – such as whether a fiber had been dyed to have a bluish or a reddish tint .
All told , Urton has found seven additional bits of binary information that might signal something .
Perhaps one means " read this as a word , not a number . "
Perhaps the binary code served as a kind of markup language , allowing the Inca to make notes on top of Locke 's number - recording system .
And perhaps the 200 or so anomalous khipu do n't follow Locke 's rules because they 've transcended them .
Most Incan scholars are intrigued by Urton 's ideas , though a few skeptics have noted that he has not produced any proof that his binary code carries meaning , much less that the khipu contain narratives .
The Harvard professor concedes that some of the information he 's looking at may not signal anything .
But he is convinced the khipu have stories to tell , and he has some history on his side .
José de Acosta , a Jesuit missionary sometimes called the Pliny of the New World , wrote a description of the khipu at the end of the 16th century .
In it , he describes how the " woven reckonings " were used to record financial transactions involving hens , eggs , and hay .
But he also noted that the native people considered the khipu to be " witnesses and authentic writing . "
" I saw a bundle of these strings , " he wrote , " on which a woman had brought a written confession of her whole life and used it to confess just as I would have done with words written on paper . "
EGYPTIAN HIEROGLYPHICS , LINEAR B , ancient Mayan writing – all of the great decipherments have been accomplished by a combination of logic and intuition , persistence and flexibility .
Decoding scripts is not like looking for a combination that will open a lock .
It 's more like rock climbing :
You find a foothold , push up , and hope another presents itself .
Jean - Jacques Quisquater – a tall man with a thin crown of wispy white hair – would like to join the pantheon of puzzle solvers .
Quisquater directs a large cryptography laboratory at Belgium 's historic Catholic University of Louvain , where he is known for his work on securing smartcards .
In the fall of 2003 , he came to MIT for a yearlong academic sabbatical .
At the time , he had been thinking nostalgically of a trip to Greece 40 years before when he saw the famous undeciphered Phaistos Disc , a small red - brown disc from deep in the second millennium BC covered on either side with a spiral of glyphs – a fish , a shield , an olive branch .
Quisquater hoped to find something equally romantic and challenging to work on .
When he heard about the mystery of the khipu , he was immediately enthralled .
He soon met Urton , and they teamed up with a father - son pair of MIT computer scientists , Martin and Erik Demaine .
The group began chatting , with the mathematicians offering detailed plans about how to sort the data .
The team agreed that one of Quisquater 's graduate students , Vincent Castus , would first try an analysis known as a suffix tree .
The method uses a computer to identify all the blocks of characters in a text that repeat themselves .
Thus , the word Mississippi would yield several repeated blocks , including issi , iss , and ss .
Suffix trees are used in genetic analysis to find the shortest unique pattern in a sample of DNA .
With the khipu database loaded onto his iMac , Castus worked to build a suffix tree from the knots , leaving aside the more complicated binary data on this first pass .
He began in May 2006 .
By October he had worked out all the details and found an astonishing number of repeats : 3,000 different groups of repeated five - knot sequences .
Shorter patterns appeared even more often .
He found several pairs of khipu linked by large numbers of matches , suggesting that they could be related .
None of this tells us whether the khipu contain words or stories .
It 's possible the researchers have found khipu that just happen to include repeated number sequences that are not interesting for any particular reason , or that some khipu are deliberate copies of others .
But Urton suspects there 's more to it than that .
He knows repetition is the code - breaker 's great friend .
A Cold War sleuth noticing an oft - used sequence might guess it stood for Moscow or Khrushchev .
Recognizing repeated place - names was one of the first steps in deciphering the ancient Mycenaean script Linear B .
Now the team has a key for all the khipu in the database , allowing them to instantly identify whenever a particular sequence appears .
They also have a list of common short sequences – the most obvious candidates for words .
The team had previously made one breakthrough in identifying connections between knots , thanks to Brezine , who has a background in mathematics and just happens to be a weaver on the side .
The master of the khipu database , she wanted to find examples of strings with numbers that added up to sums on another khipu .
So she developed a simple algorithm and combed through the data .
Her efforts identified a handful of interlinked khipu that had been uncovered together in a cache in Puruchuco , an archaeological site near Lima .
The khipu looked like records kept by three successively higher levels of Incan administrators .
Add the numbers on one khipu and the sum is found on another , with that sum in turn found on a third .
Imagine , for example , that they depict the results of a census .
The village counts up its people and then forwards the total to the district .
The district records the numbers from several villages and then forwards the results up to the provincial head .
Urton and Brezine do not know what is being counted ( people ? llamas ? ) , but their 2005 Science paper showed for the first time that information flowed between the khipu .
They have also identified what may be the first word .
The two higher - level khipu in the census example use an introductory sequence of three figure - eight knots ( 1 - 1 - 1 ) that does not appear on what they assume is the village - level khipu .
Perhaps only the upper layers have the sequence because it is a label for a particular place , used when compiling information from many locations .
Maybe , they suggest , the first symbol to be read off a khipu means this : Puruchuco .
Quisquater 's team , meanwhile , is now working on another , even more ambitious way of extracting clues .
It depends on thinking of each knot as a node and each khipu as a network and the links being lengths of string .
One of the surprises from the burgeoning new field of network theory is that the role of a particular node can be summarized – in a deep and meaningful way – by a single number .
A good example of this is Google 's PageRank algorithm .
The power of the company 's search engine comes from its ability to rank Web pages by relevance .
On the Web , a link runs from one page to another , like an arrow .
The algorithm interprets that as the first page voting for the second one .
Votes flow from across the Internet , like streams joining rivers , eventually pooling at the eBays of the world .
The analysis that the team plans for these khipu networks does n't exactly mimic PageRank .
After all , the string links between knots are n't unidirectional like arrows ; one knot does n't point to another .
But the concept is the same :
If you think about a big mass of information as a network , and analyze it as a network , looking for the thousands of small and big ways that different piles of information relate to one another , you can see things that you would n't notice otherwise .
Vincent Blondel , a Belgian mathematics professor who is a friend of Quisquater 's , recently helped work out the math behind an approach that allows a computer to calculate degrees of similarity between nodes in two separate networks .
Like PageRank , the procedure uses voting , but it assigns each node many scores instead of one and employs a more complex scheme for calculating the totals .
Type " baseball " into Google and its spiders will race over the Internet , look at links , and spit back that yankees.com is the 11th most useful site for you and seattlemariners.com is the 22nd .
If Quisquater 's algorithm were used on the Web , it would return a slew of numbers , some of which would show similarities between different nodes – or knots .
So you 'd see that the Yankees and Mariners sites are similar because both receive feeds from majorleaguebaseball.com and have outgoing links to the homepages for 29 teams .
When Quisquater 's algorithm is used on khipu , it will reveal knots or groups of knots that always play a certain role in relationship to others .
These might be labels or formatting signs .
For example , it may turn out that some of the khipu start with sets of knots that say something like " read this as a calendar . "
Or collections of khipu may have similar networks of closely related knots , perhaps signaling that they originate from the same geographic area .
Or it could even turn out that the anomalous khipu will all have some pattern that signifies " read this as a story . "
The results from this technique should come in sometime later this year , and they will provide valuable clues , even if they do n't immediately crack the Inca paradox .
URTON'S GREAT INSIGHT has been to treat the khipu not just as a textile or a simple abacus but as an advanced , alien technology .
Sitting on a poncho draped over the couch in his office , Urton describes a formative trip to a remote Bolivian village where he worked with traditional weavers .
Observing these women spin and ply yarn into multicolored tapestries with elaborate symmetries , he caught a glimpse of the Incan mind at work .
For an expert weaver , fabric is a record of many choices , a dance of twists , turns , and pulls that leads to the final product .
They would have seen a fabric – be it cloth or knotted strings – a bit like a chess master views a game in progress .
Yes , they see a pattern of pieces on a board , but they also have a feel for the moves that led there .
" You can see inside of it , " Urton says .
It would be all too easy to dismiss the khipu as the work of a less advanced civilization , one that did n't develop guns , iron , or wheels .
But for more than a decade , Urton has assumed that the khipu are evidence of Incan sophistication in ways we have still not grasped .
Acosta , the 16th - century Jesuit missionary , believed this .
He traveled throughout the Americas and recorded several observations of khipu in use .
He described religious converts memorizing prayers using khipu - like devices made of small stones or kernels of corn .
He also described people in a churchyard completing difficult calculations " without making the slightest error …
Whoever wants may judge whether this is clever or if these people are brutish , " he wrote , " but I judge it is certain that , in that which they here apply themselves , they get the better of us . "

In rice - growing states , traces of an unapproved genetically modified ( GM ) rice have been found mixed in with conventional rice meant for human consumption .
In Oregon , genetically engineered creeping bentgrass , being tested for possible use on golf courses , has been found miles outside its test beds , making it the first GM plant known to have escaped into the wild .
In Hawaii , a federal judge has admonished the US Department of Agriculture ( USDA ) for displaying " utter disregard " for the state 's endangered native plant species .
The judge says the USDA failed to conduct research on the environmental effects of fields of experimental corn and sugarcane that had been genetically modified to produce pharmaceuticals .
Environmental and food - safety groups have asked for a moratorium on all field tests of experimental drug - producing plants until their safety precautions can be reviewed .
Early indications are that in each case little substantial harm has been done .
The experimental rice , for example , is similar to two other GM strains already approved for general use .
But many who closely watch how biotechnology is changing agriculture , including those who see a valuable role for GM crops , are disturbed by what appears to be a series of recent incidents showing lax supervision of experimental plantings by the government and agribusinesses .
" You absolutely should be in compliance with regulations , " says Martina Newell - McGloughlin , an internationally recognized advocate for the uses of biotechnology based in Davis , Calif .
She directs the University of California 's systemwide biotechnology program .
The three incidents " are n't health concerns , but they are regulatory concerns , " she says .
" It 's incumbent on the companies , on the USDA ... to ensure that everybody complies with these regulations . "
The three incidents convey a message that " the US government has been somewhat lax in its oversight of the biotechnology industry and in some instances has not taken its responsibility to regulate as strongly as it should , " says Gregory Jaffe , director of the biotechnology project for the Center for Science in the Public Interest , a consumer group in Washington that has expressed qualified support for the use of genetic modification in agriculture .
" Clearly this shows that the companies and the government do n't have as much control over experimental crops as they need to have , " Mr. Jaffe says .
" I think there 's a sloppiness out there .
Industry does n't take the rules of conduct as seriously as it should . "
Government agencies , he says , have adopted what almost amounts to a " do n't look , do n't find " policy .
" We have a fairly passive regulatory system , " he says , that does " a little spot checking " but mostly relies on businesses to step forward and report their own problems .
The cases of the escaped GM grass and the mysterious appearance of experimental rice in the food supply raise important questions , says Michael Fernandez , executive director of the Pew Initiative on Food and Biotechnology , a nonprofit group in Washington that seeks to be an independent and objective source of information on agricultural biotechnology .
" How do you know that [ GM crops ] are staying where you want them to stay ? " he asks .
" As there are more kinds of genetically - engineered crops out there , it continues to pose challenges for companies and for regulators . "
Some amount of movement of GM crops outside their containment areas " is virtually inevitable , " Mr. Fernandez says .
" The question is , how do we feel about that ?
How important is that ?
Does it matter what the crop is ? "
The bentgrass may pose no significant danger , he says , but " would we feel differently " if it were a plant that produced pharmaceuticals ?
Last December , a report from the USDA 's own Office of the Inspector General urged the department 's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service ( APHIS ) division " to strengthen its accountability for field tests of [ genetically enhanced ] crops . "
The report added that " weaknesses in APHIS regulations and internal management controls increase the risk that regulated genetically engineered organisms ( GEO ) will inadvertently persist in the environment .... "
The report also criticized APHIS for lacking " basic information about the field test sites it approves and is responsible for monitoring , including where and how the crops are being grown , and what becomes of them at the end of the field test . "
In a response , APHIS agreed to implement 23 of the inspector general 's 28 recommendations .
Among those it rejected was a request to develop guidelines to physically restrict public access to unapproved edible GM crops .
US corn and cotton are mostly GM
America is awash in genetically modified crops that already have been approved for use both as animal feed and for human consumption .
This year , 61 percent of all corn and 89 percent of all soybeans planted in the United States were GM varieties , the USDA estimates .
More than 80 percent of the US cotton crop is also GM .
But despite that wide usage , the development of other applications and other crops has largely stalled .
Plans to introduce a GM wheat to the market have yet to go forward .
Nearly all widespread applications of GM to agriculture have been limited to two functions : enhancing resistance to insects or to herbicides .
Plans to alter plants through genetic modification to improve such qualities as their flavor , growth rates , or size have yet to blossom .
Suspicion of GM foods in Europe , and to some extent in Asia , is limiting the world market for GM crops .
China had been expected to OK the use of GM rice by now , but appears to be dragging its feet .
After the news spread that unapproved GM long - grain rice had been found in US consumer supplies , the European Union announced it would require imports of long - grain rice from the US to be certified as free from the GM strain .
Japan has suspended its imports of American long - grain rice pending further review .
Farmers sue over ' contaminated ' rice
Earlier this month , the USDA reported that a long - grain GM rice strain produced by Bayer CropScience had been found in bins of conventional commercial rice .
It marked the first instance in which an unapproved GM rice had been found in the rice supply .
The GM rice poses no health or environmental threat , the USDA said .
But rice farmers in Arkansas , Missouri , Mississippi , Louisiana , and Texas filed a lawsuit against Bayer this week alleging its genetically modified rice contaminated the crop , according to the Associated Press .
The USDA is conducting an investigation to determine how the contamination occurred , and Bayer now is petitioning to have the strain approved for general use , a spokesman for APHIS says .
In Oregon , APHIS is continuing to monitor the escaped creeping bentgrass , an APHIS spokeswoman says .
The ruling in Hawaii by a federal judge was the first to involve drug - producing GM plants .
A coalition of consumer and environmental groups is asking that the government suspend all field tests of drug - producing plants until its process for issuing permits can be reviewed .
In addition , says Bill Freese , science policy analyst at the Center for Food Safety , a consumer group in Washington that is among those seeking a moratorium , the USDA should follow all the recommendations in its inspector general 's report .
It should also take additional measures , such as regularly testing fields neighboring GM test beds for potential contamination , he says .
But Dr. Newell - McGloughlin hopes that this summer 's outbreak of GM fiascos wo n't be taken out of context .
" The few missteps that have occurred , in my opinion , are tiny in the context of the large amount of good that has been done with this [ GM ] technology , " she says .
Genetic manipulation has much more promise for good that has yet to be tapped .
By overreacting , we could miss out . "
The risks , she says , always must be weighed against the benefits .
" There is the cost of not doing something , " she says .

Foreword to Ron Paul ’s new book : A Foreign Policy of Freedom : u2018 Peace , Commerce , Honest Friendship ’
Ron Paul has always believed that foreign and domestic policy should be conducted according to the same principles .
Government should be restrained from intervening at home or abroad because its actions fail to achieve their stated aims , create more harm than good , shrink the liberty of the people , and violate rights .
Does that proposition seem radical ?
Outlandish or farflung ?
Once you hear it stated , it makes perfect sense that there is no sharp distinction between the principles of domestic and foreign policy .
They are part of the same analytical fabric .
What would be inconsistent would be to favor activist government at home but restraint abroad , or the reverse : restraint at home and activism abroad .
Government unleashed behaves in its own interests , and will not restrict itself in any area of life .
It must be curbed in all areas of life lest freedom suffer .
If you recognize the line of thinking in this set of beliefs , it might be because you have read the Federalist Papers , the writings of Thomas Jefferson or George Washington or James Madison , or examined the philosophical origins of the American Revolution .
Or you might have followed the debates that took place in the presidential election of 1800 , in which this view emerged triumphant .
Or perhaps you read the writings of the free traders prior to the Civil War , or the opponents of the War on Spain , or those who warned of entering World War I .
Or perhaps you have read the speeches and books against FDR ’s New Deal : the same group warned of the devastating consequences of World War II .
Or maybe , in more recent history , you understood the animating principles behind the Republican takeover of Congress in 1994 : a generation had turned away from all forms of foreign and domestic “ nation building . ”
Not only does this Paulian view have a precedent in American history ; it sums up the very core of what is distinctive about the American contribution to political ideas .
The proposition was and is that people are better able to manage their lives than government can manage them .
Under conditions of liberty , the result is prosperity and orderly civilization .
Under government control , the result is relative poverty and unpredictable chaos .
The proof is in the news every day .
How unusual , how incredibly strange , that Ron Paul , who has stood for these principles his entire public life , is criticized by some as a radical , outside the mainstream , and influenced by experimental ideas that are marginal at best .
And why is he treated this way ?
Because he takes the ideas of Washington and Jefferson seriously , just as seriously as he takes the idea of freedom itself , and he does so in times when faith in Leviathan remains the dominant political ideology .
Ideology is such a powerful force that it has propped up policy inconsistency for more than a century .
The left has a massive agenda for the state at home , and yet complains bitterly , with shock and dismay , that the same tools are used to start wars and build imperial structures abroad .
The right claims to want to restrain government at home ( at least in some ways ) while whooping it up for war and global reconstruction abroad .
It does n’t take a game - theory genius to predict how this conflict works itself out in the long run .
The left and the right agree to disagree on intellectual grounds but otherwise engage in a dangerous quid pro quo .
They turn a blind eye to the government they do n’t like so long as they get the government they do like .
It ’s one thing for the left to grudgingly support international intervention .
It makes some sense for a group that believes that government is omniscient enough to bring about fairness , justice , and equality at home to do the same for people abroad .
In fact , I ’ve never been able to make much sense out of left - wing antiwar activism , simply because it cuts so much against the idea of socialism , which itself can be summed up as perpetual war on the liberty and property of the people .
What strikes me as ridiculous is the right - wing view that government is incompetent and dangerous domestically — at least in economic and social affairs — but has some sort of Midas Touch internationally such that it can bring freedom , democracy , and justice to any land its troops deign to invade .
Not that the right wing is principled enough to pursue its domestic views , but I ’m speaking here of its campaign rhetoric and higher - level of critique of government that you find in their periodicals and books .
The precise critique of government that they offer for the welfare state and regulatory measures — they are expensive , counterproductive , hobble human energies — applies many times over to international interventions .
But the right always seems to have an excuse for its inconsistency .
In the early fifties , many on the right said that the usual principle of nonintervention had to give way to the fight against communism because this was a uniquely evil threat facing the world .
We have to put up with a “ totalitarian bureaucracy ” within our shores ( words used by W.F. Buckley ) for the duration in order to beat back the great threat abroad .
And so Leviathan grew and grew , and never more than under Republican presidents .
Then one day , communism went away , the regimes having collapsed from self - imposed deprivation and ideological change .
A few years went by after 1990 when the right was inching toward a Paulian consistency .
Then 9 - 11 happened , and the great excuse for Leviathan again entered the picture .
Never mind that , as Congressman Paul pointed out , the crime of 9 - 11 was motivated by retribution against ten years of killer US sanctions against Iraq , US troops on Muslim holy lands , and US subsidies for Palestinian occupation .
No , the American right bought into the same farce that led them to support the Cold War : Islamic fanaticism is a unique evil unlike anything we ’ve ever seen , so we have to put up with Leviathan ( again ! ) for the duration .
Well , Ron Paul did n’t buy into it .
He is unique in this respect , and this is especially notable since he has been under pressure from his own party and at a time when his party has ruled the executive , judicial , and legislative branches .
He stuck by his principles , and not merely as a pious gesture .
His critique of the post 9 - 11 warfare state has been spot on in speech after speech .
He foresaw the failure of the US invasion of Afghanistan .
He never believed the nonsense about how US bombs would transform Iraq into a modern democracy .
He never went along with the propaganda lies about weapons of mass destruction .
Nowadays , we often hear politicians say that they have changed their minds on the Iraq War and that if they had known then what they know now , they never would have gone along .
Well , hindsight is child ’s play in politics .
What takes guts and insight is the ability to spot a hoax even as it is being perpetrated .
In any case , they have no excuse for not knowing : Ron Paul told them !
The freedom to trade internationally is an essential principle .
It means that consumers should not be penalized for buying from anyone , or selling to anyone , regardless of the residence .
Nor should domestic suppliers be granted anything like a monopoly or subsidized treatment .
Nor should trade be used as a weapon in the form of sanctions .
Ron Paul has upheld these principles as well , which makes him an old - fashioned liberal in the manner of Cobden and Bright and the American Southern tradition .
He has also rejected the mistake of many free traders who believe that a military arm is necessary to back the invisible hand of the marketplace .
For Ron Paul , freedom is all of a piece .
Ron Paul ’s singular voice on foreign affairs has done so much to keep the flame of a consistent liberty burning in times when it might otherwise have been extinguished .
He has drawn public attention to the ideas of the founders .
He has alerted people to the dangers of empire .
He has linked domestic and foreign affairs through libertarian analytics , even when others have been bamboozled by the lies or too intimidated to contradict them .
He has told the truth , always .
For this , every American , every citizen of the world , is deeply in his debt .
In fact , I ’m willing to predict that a hundred years from now and more , when all the current office holders are all but forgotten , Ron Paul ’s name will be remembered as a bright light in dark times .

Being locked in the zoo and offered bananas to eat is the kind of extreme diet scenario to wake some of us screaming in the night .
But that was how a group of volunteers opted to try to cut their blood pressure and cholesterol levels .
EVO DIET : WHAT THEY ATE 5kgs or 2,300 calories of fruit , vegetables , nuts and honey
On a 3 - day rota , typically : Broccoli , carrots , radishes Cabbage , tomatoes , watercress Strawberries , apricots , bananas Mangoes , melons , figs , plums Satsumas , hazelnuts
One volunteer 's story
For example , nearly half Britain 's 117,000 annual deaths from coronary heart disease are linked to high cholesterol , according to the British Heart Foundation .
And while the government urges everyone to eat five portions of fruit and veg a day , obesity is still rising .
So could an experiment on ordinary people 's lives deliver the healthy eating message ?
Nine volunteers , aged 36 to 49 , took on the 12 - day Evo Diet , consuming up to five kilos of raw fruit and veg a day .
Hunter - gatherer style
The regime was devised by nutritionist and registered dietician Lynne Garton and King 's College Hospital .
It was based on research showing such a diet could have health benefits for cholesterol levels and blood pressure , because it is made up of the types of foods our bodies evolved to eat over thousands of years .
Ms Garton looked for inspiration to the plant - based diet of our closest relatives , the apes , and devised a three - day rotating menu of fruit , vegetables , nuts and honey .
The prescribed menu was :
• safe to eat raw ;
• met adult human daily nutritional requirements ; and
• provided 2,300 calories - between the 2,000 recommended for women and 2,500 for men ,
Volunteers could also drink water .
In the second week , standard portions of cooked oily fish were introduced - a nod to a more hunter - gatherer lifestyle .
There was a lot of farting going on
Jill Fullerton - Smith
Producer
Among the volunteers was Jon Thornton , 36 , a driving instructor from Sheffield , who had never eaten vegetables , from childhood upwards .
Weighing in at almost 19 - stone , his typical diet read like the children 's book , Mr Strong .
Breakfast was four slices of toast ; at 10 am a bacon sausage and egg sarnie followed ; fish and chips for tea and a Chinese take - away before bed .
That was before his wife signed up Mr Thornton for the experiment .
Over 12 days he lost 5.7kg ( 12.5lbs ) , and reduced his cholesterol by 20 % .
His blood pressure also fell .
Despite nearly backing out at the start - the first day's food arrived in a cool - box , was raw and he was distinctly uncomfortable with the idea of broccoli - he was converted to eating vast portions of fresh fruit and veg .
" I did n't feel any loss of energy , I did n't feel ill at all , " he says .
" It 's not a diet you 'd recommend as a diet itself , but it worked to bring my cholesterol and blood pressure down . "
Harmony in camp
With so much food bulk and plenty of calories the subjects did not go hungry - indeed most failed to finish their daily ration .
And once they were over the withdrawal from caffeinated drinks and some foods , says Ms Garton , they enjoyed good energy levels and mood .
So the " moments of unhappiness and grumpiness " that the TV crew was primed to capture failed to happen .
The proved to be a motivated group , although the one odorous side - effect from all that roughage could n't be ignored .
Driving instructor Jon cut his cholesterol and his weight
Overall , the cholesterol levels dropped 23 % , an amount usually achieved only through anti-cholesterol drugs statins .
The group 's average blood pressure fell from a level of 140/83 - almost hypertensive - to 122/76 .
Though it was not intended to be a weight loss diet , they dropped 4.4kg ( 9.7lbs ) , on average .
The regime provided an education for all , and a permanent change for some .
" The main lesson that they took away was to eat more fruit and veg , " says Ms Garton .
They also cut salt intake from a group average of 12g a day , to 1g ( against a guideline maximum of 6g ) and reduced saturated fat - which makes cholesterol - from 13 % to 5 % of calories ( recommended , 11 % ) .
At the same time , they increased the soluble fibre which binds cholesterol in the gut , so that it is expelled , and increased the intake of plant sterols - which help to lower cholesterol .
For Jon , life has changed since he was " released " from the zoo .
He has gained a little weight but now says he only eats when hungry and knows good food can help health and longevity .
He can play football because his knees no longer hurt under the extra weight and he goes cycling .
He even managed to hold out at the most tempting time of year .
" For the first time in 36 years this year I had vegetables with my Christmas dinner , " he says .
" Usually , I say no to them and have a few extra roast potatoes instead . "

Yes you can eat well on a plant only diet - it 's called being vegan .
And the food does not have to be dull .
Rebecca , Brighton
It 's amazing what can be achieved with a little will power .
Slightly extreme , but we survived for millions of years in this way , and surely if everything comes full circle , the days of fast food could be numbered ?
Julia , Manchester
This is all just common sense really .
I do n't think it 's possible for anyone in the twenty - first century to not know how to eat healthily .
The information has not only been available to us but has been actively shouted at us for as long as I can remember .
I lost forty pounds last year after giving up a lot of processed food and carbohydrates , and moving to simpler and often more pleasing meals , such as a bowl of fruit for my evening meal .
I also got on my bicycle and started exercising every day after work .
I am more fit now than ever before .
Mark L. Scott , Briton in the USA
Sounds great and you do n't have to cook .
Abby , Alexandria
I notice there 's no mention of the cost of this wondrous diet .
Drew McMutrie , Livingston , Scotland
I 've always been a firm believer in this way of eating .
I do n't have a diet regime and sometimes I eat the most unhealthy , fattening , salt - laden things ( e.g. a 10 piece family KFC bucket for 1 ) but for the vast majority of the time , I only eat when I 'm hungry and I eat plenty of fruit and raw or partially cooked veg .
I 'm 25 , very healthy , 6ft1 and just over 11 stone .
Never tired , stressed or irregular .
All diets are a sham , once people see past the need for the 3 meals a day at set times rubbish a lot of people will start to get healthier .
Matt , Birmingham
There is a significant variable in here that has not been accounted for : to what extent is the lower cholesterol and blood pressure the result of 12 days in a relaxed and laid back environment , rather than 12 days in the busy mess of work , life and everything else ?
Matthew G , London
I think the problem with the 5 - a - day campaign is that many people think they should eat 5 portions of fruit / veg in addition to all their existing junk .
Perhaps it should be made clearer that they also need to reduce their intake of modern processed trash ?
David , Cheshire , UK
If we need TV programmes to teach us to eat the diet our bodies evolved for then we really are all doomed .
Ian Westbrook , Folkestone , Kent
I do n't think much of that diet as an ' ape diet ' .
Is that nutritionist aware that our closest relatives are omnivores who , in the case of Bonobos , if not all chimps , will kill and eat their own kind ?
More half - baked disinformation from the " eat healthy " brigade !
Mike Watkinson , London
Drew McMutrie asks about the cost of the diet .
It always amazes me when people say they can't afford to eat healthy food - fruit and veg are really cheap !
Whenever I 'm on a health kick ( like now ) I feel very smug at the supermarket checkout with bags and bags of produce for only a tenner , whereas the person in front was buying chips , crisps , biscuits , ready meals etc and paying several times as much fir the privilege .
Tom , London
I 'm almost certain that the ancestral environment in which we evolved did not provide us with tropical fruits such as mangoes alongside mild - climate vegetables like cabbage and broccoli .
Nor did it allow us to eat summer fruits like strawberries in the same three days as autumnal produce like hazelnuts .
By all means cut out the processed foods , but dressing it up as some faddy ' evo diet ' is just more nutritional nonsense .
Jane , Kent
Bonobos do not eat each other ; Mike Watkinson 's comment is confusing Bonobos with common Chimpanzees , who have only been seen to kill and eat each other under extreme environmental stress .
Thomas Worthington , Bangor , NI
Yes it was a publicity stunt , but unlike other stunts this had several real points to make .
And what better way than by taking advantage of the Big Brother mania that is sweeping the country .

MIT scientists have harnessed the construction talents of tiny viruses to build ultra-small " nanowire " structures for use in very thin lithium - ion batteries .
By manipulating a few genes inside these viruses , the team was able to coax the organisms to grow and self - assemble into a functional electronic device .
The goal of the work , led by MIT Professors Angela Belcher , Paula Hammond and Yet - Ming Chiang , is to create batteries that cram as much electrical energy into as small or lightweight a package as possible .
The batteries they hope to build could range from the size of a grain of rice up to the size of existing hearing aid batteries .
Batteries consist of two opposite electrodes -- an anode and cathode -- separated by an electrolyte .
In the current work , the MIT team used an intricate assembly process to create the anode .
Specifically , they manipulated the genes in a laboratory strain of a common virus , making the microbes collect exotic materials -- cobalt oxide and gold .
And because these viruses are negatively charged , they can be layered between oppositely charged polymers to form thin , flexible sheets .
The result ?
A dense , virus - loaded film that serves as an anode .
A report on the work will appear in the April 7 issue of Science .
Belcher , the Germeshausen Professor of Materials Science and Engineering and Biological Engineering ; Chiang , the Kyocera Professor of Materials Science and Engineering ( MSE ) ; and Hammond , the Mark A. Hyman Professor of Chemical Engineering ( ChE ) , led a team of five additional researchers .
They are MSE graduate students Ki Tae Nam ( the lead author ) , Dong - Wan Kim , Chung - Yi Chiang and Nonglak Meethong , and ChE postdoctoral associate Pil. J. Yoo .
In their research , the MIT team altered the virus 's genes so they make protein coats that collect molecules of cobalt oxide , plus gold .
The viruses then align themselves on the polymer surface to form ultrathin wires .
Each virus , and thus the wire , is only 6 nanometers ( 6 billionths of a meter ) in diameter , and 880 nanometers in length .
" We can make them in larger diameters , " Belcher said , " but they are all 880 nanometers in length , " which matches the length of the individual virus particles .
And , " once we 've altered the genes of the virus to grow the electrode material , we can easily clone millions of identical copies of the virus to use in assembling our batteries .
" For the metal oxide we chose cobalt oxide because it has very good specific capacity , which will produce batteries with high energy density , " meaning it can store two or three times more energy for its size and weight compared to previously used battery electrode materials .
And adding the gold further increased the wires ' energy density , she added .
Equally important , the reactions needed to create nanowires occur at normal room temperatures and pressures , so there is no need for expensive pressure - cooking technology to get the job done .
The work is important , too , because energy density is a vital quality in batteries .
A lack of energy density -- meaning the amount of charge a battery of a given size can usefully carry -- is what has hampered development of electric cars , since existing batteries are generally too heavy and too weak to compete with gasoline as an energy source .
Still , battery technology is gradually being improved and may someday even become competitive as the price of oil escalates .
" The nanoscale materials we 've made supply two to three times the electrical energy for their mass or volume , compared to previous materials , " the team reported .
The researchers ' work was spurred by " growing evidence that ' nanostructured ' materials can improve the electrochemical properties of lithium - ion batteries , " compared to more conventional batteries based on older technologies , the team wrote in Science .
But to create new battery materials , Belcher noted , special control is needed so just the right amounts of the exotic materials end up exactly where they belong .
Cobalt oxide " has shown excellent electrochemical cycling properties , and is thus under consideration as an electrode for advanced lithium - ion batteries . "
In earlier research , Belcher and colleagues learned they could exploit the abilities of microbes to recognize the correct molecules and assemble them where they belong .
A new means of inducing this order comes from self - assembly , a tool that is commonly used now in Hammond 's lab .
" By harnessing the electrostatic nature of the assembly process with the functional properties of the virus , we can create highly ordered composite thin films combining the function of the virus and polymer systems , " Hammond said .
This work was funded by the Army Research Office Institute of Collaborative Biotechnologies , the Institute of Soldier Nanotechnologies and the David and Lucille Packard Foundation .

Officials celebrated as the EU flag was raised in Bucharest
Tens of thousands attended concerts in the two capitals , Bucharest and Sofia .
The Romanian president said EU entry was an " enormous chance for future generations " , while Bulgaria 's leader said it was a " heavenly moment " .
Their accession means the EU now has 27 members and half a billion people , and stretches as far east as the Black Sea .
The day we are welcoming - 1 January 2007 - will undoubtedly find its place among the most important dates in our national history
Georgi Parvanov
Bulgarian president
Q&A : EU enlargement
" We arrived in Europe .
Welcome to Europe , " Mr Basescu said on stage in University Square , where he was joined by EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn and government ministers .
Foreign ministers of Germany , Denmark , Austria and Hungary , who were also attending , wished Romanian citizens a happy new year .
Earlier , the EU flag was raised outside the government headquarters in Bucharest to the European anthem , Beethoven 's Ode to Joy .
Thousands of people in Battenberg Square cheered as midnight struck .
Fireworks lit the sky over the building where the Communist Party once held its headquarters .
In an emotional address to the nation , Bulgarian President Georgi Parvanov called the country 's EU entry a " heavenly moment " .
" The day we are welcoming - 1 January 2007 - will undoubtedly find its place among the most important dates in our national history , " he said .
" But let 's make it clear , our future success as a nation depends not on European funds and resources , but on our own work . "
' Falling enthusiasm '
The accession of the two new countries comes amid falling enthusiasm in Europe for the bloc 's continuing expansion .
A recent Eurobarometer poll suggested only 41 % of people in the 15 states that were part of the EU before 2004 supported further enlargement .
The two new countries will now be subject to strict monitoring , to ensure they make more progress in the fight against corruption and organised crime .
They face export bans on certain foods , and Bulgaria has been warned that 55 of its aircraft could be grounded unless they reach EU safety standards .
Analysts say there is a risk that EU aid will be mis-spent , or just not taken up because the countries ' institutions are too disorganised .
There are also fears that the countries ' economies will fail to compete with the rest of the EU 's once trade barriers come down .
Immigration fears
Both Bulgaria and Romania are much poorer than the rest of the EU , with GDP per capita of about 33 % of the EU average , compared with 50 % in Poland .
Some Western European member states fear a flood of new immigrants , but officials in both countries say most of those who wanted to work abroad have already left .
Most of the 15 older EU member states have put in place restrictions on the free movement of workers from the two new members - though Finland and Sweden are two exceptions .
Also on 1 January , Slovenia became the first of the 10 states which joined the EU in 2004 to adopt the European currency , the euro .
The existing Slovenian currency , the tolar will remain in dual use with the euro for 14 days .
Germany also takes over from Finland for six months as the country holding the presidency of the European Union .

Jostein Gaarder , the author of the global literary phenomenon Sophie ’s World ( printed in 26 m copies in 53 languages ) , launches a scorching attack on Israel in Aftenposten , Norway ’s paper of record .
Gaarder , a historian of ideas , describes himself as a friend of the Jewish people but doubts whether Israel truly is the same .
Suffice it to say that this will not appear in the New York Times anytime soon .
The form of Gaarder ’s condemnation is inspired by Amos , the first Judaic prophet whose message is preserved in scroll ( ca. 750 B.C. ) .
Quoting Wikipedia : “ The central idea of the book of Amos according to most scholars is that Yahweh puts his people on the same level as the nations that surround it —
Yahweh expects the same morality of them all . ”
God ’s chosen people
Jostein Gaarder , Aftenposten 05.08.06
From the Norwegian by Sirocco
There is no turning back .
It is time to learn a new lesson :
We do no longer recognize the state of Israel .
We could not recognize the South African apartheid regime , nor did we recognize the Afghan Taliban regime .
Then there were many who did not recognize Saddam Hussein ’s Iraq or the Serbs ’ ethnic cleansing .
We must now get used to the idea :
The state of Israel in its current form is history .
We do not believe in the notion of God ’s chosen people .
We laugh at this people ’s fancies and weep over its misdeeds .
To act as God ’s chosen people is not only stupid and arrogant , but a crime against humanity .
We call it racism .
Limits to tolerance
There are limits to our patience , and there are limits to our tolerance .
We do not believe in divine promises as justification for occupation and apartheid .
We have left the Middle Ages behind .
We laugh uneasily at those who still believe that the God of flora , fauna , and galaxies has selected one people in particular as his favorite and given it funny stone tablets , burning bushes , and a license to kill .
We call child murderers ‘ child murderers ’ and will never accept that such have a divine or historic mandate excusing their outrages .
We say but this :
Shame on all apartheid , shame on ethnic cleansing , shame on every terrorist strike against civilians , be it carried out by Hamas , Hizballah , or the state of Israel !
Unscrupulous art of war
We acknowledge and pay heed to Europe ’s deep responsibility for the plight of the Jews , for the disgraceful harassment , the pogroms , and the Holocaust .
It was historically and morally necessary for Jews to get their own home .
However , the state of Israel , with its unscrupulous art of war and its disgusting weapons , has massacred its own legitimacy .
It has systematically flouted International Law , international conventions , and countless UN resolutions , and it can no longer expect protection from same .
It has carpet bombed the recognition of the world .
But fear not !
The time of trouble shall soon be over .
The state of Israel has seen its Soweto .
We are now at the watershed .
There is no turning back .
The state of Israel has raped the recognition of the world and shall have no peace until it lays down its arms .
Without defense , without skin
May spirit and word sweep away the apartheid walls of Israel .
The state of Israel does not exist .
It is now without defense , without skin .
May the world therefore have mercy on the civilian population .
For it is not civilian individuals at whom our doomsaying is directed .
We wish the people of Israel well , nothing but well , but we reserve the right not to eat Jaffa oranges as long as they taste foul and are poisonous .
It was endurable to live some years without the blue grapes of apartheid .
They celebrate their triumphs
We do not believe that Israel mourns forty killed Lebanese children more than it for over three thousand years has lamented forty years in the desert .
We note that many Israelis celebrate such triumphs like they once cheered the scourges of the Lord as “ fitting punishment ” for the people of Egypt .
( In that tale , the Lord , God of Israel , appears as an insatiable sadist . )
We query whether most Israelis think that one Israeli life is worth more than forty Palestinian or Lebanese lives .
For we have seen pictures of little Israeli girls writing hateful greetings on the bombs to be dropped on the civilian population of Lebanon and Palestine .
Little Israeli girls are not cute when they strut with glee at death and torment across the fronts .
The retribution of blood vengeance
We do not recognize the rhetoric of the state of Israel .
We do not recognize the spiral of retribution of the blood vengeance with “ an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth . ”
We do not recognize the principle of one or a thousand Arab eyes for one Israeli eye .
We do not recognize collective punishment or population - wide diets as political weapons .
Two thousand years have passed since a Jewish rabbi criticized the ancient doctrine of “ an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth . ”
He said : “ Do to others as you would have them do to you . ”
We do not recognize a state founded on antihumanistic principles and on the ruins of an archaic national and war religion .
Or as Albert Schweitzer expressed it : “ Humanitarianism consists in never sacrificing a human being to a purpose . ”
Compassion and forgiveness
We do not recognize the old Kingdom of David as a model for the 21st century map of the Middle East .
The Jewish rabbi claimed two thousand years ago that the Kingdom of God is not a martial restoration of the Kingdom of David , but that the Kingdom of God is within us and among us .
The Kingdom of God is compassion and forgiveness .
Two thousand years have passed since the Jewish rabbi disarmed and humanized the old rhetoric of war .
Even in his time , the first Zionist terrorists were operating .
Israel does not listen
For two thousand years , we have rehearsed the syllabus of humanism , but Israel does not listen .
It was not the Pharisee that helped the man who lay by the wayside , having fallen prey to robbers .
It was a Samaritan ; today we would say , a Palestinian .
For we are human first of all — then Christian , Muslim , or Jewish .
Or as the Jewish rabbi said : “ And if you greet your brethren only , what do you do more than others ? ”
We do not accept the abduction of soldiers .
But nor do we accept the deportation of whole populations or the abduction of legally elected parliamentarians and government ministers .
We recognize the state of Israel of 1948 , but not the one of 1967 .
It is the state of Israel that fails to recognize , respect , or defer to the internationally lawful Israeli state of 1948 .
Israel wants more ; more water and more villages .
To obtain this , there are those who want , with God ’s assistance , a final solution to the Palestinian problem .
The Palestinians have so many other countries , certain Israeli politicians have argued ; we have only one .
The USA or the world ?
Or as the highest protector of the state of Israel puts it : “ May God continue to bless America . ” A little child took note of that .
She turned to her mother , saying : “ Why does the President always end his speeches with ‘ God bless America ’ ?
Why not , ‘ God bless the world ’ ? ”
Then there was a Norwegian poet who let out this childlike sigh of the heart : “ Why doth Humanity so slowly progress ? ”
It was he that wrote so beautifully of the Jew and the Jewess .
But he rejected the notion of God ’s chosen people .
He personally liked to call himself a Muhammedan .
Calm and mercy
We do not recognize the state of Israel .
Not today , not as of this writing , not in the hour of grief and wrath .
If the entire Israeli nation should fall to its own devices and parts of the population have to flee the occupied areas into another diaspora , then we say :
May the surroundings stay calm and show them mercy .
It is forever a crime without mitigation to lay hand on refugees and stateless people .
Peace and free passage for the evacuating civilian population no longer protected by a state .
Fire not at the fugitives !
Take not aim at them !
They are vulnerable now like snails without shells , vulnerable like slow caravans of Palestinian and Lebanese refugees , defenseless like women and children and the old in Qana , Gaza , Sabra , and Chatilla .
Give the Israeli refugees shelter , give them milk and honey !
Let not one Israeli child be deprived of life .
Far too many children and civilians have already been murdered .

Monad Transformers and Modular Interpreters
Monad Transformers and Modular Interpreters
Abstract :
We show how a set of building blocks can be used to construct programming language interpreters , and present implementations of such building blocks capable of supporting many commonly known features , including simple expressions , three different function call mechanisms ( call - by - name , call - by - value , and lazy evaluation ) , references and assignment , nondeterminism , first - class continuations , and program tracing .
The underlying mechanism of our system is monad transformers , a simple form of abstraction for introducing a wide range of computational behaviors , such as state , I/O , continuations and exceptions .
Our work is significant in the following respects .
First , we have succeeded in designing a fully modular interpreter based on monad transformers , including important features missing from Steele 's , Espinosa's , and Wadler 's earlier efforts .
Second , we have found new ways to lift monad operations through monad transformers , in particular difficult cases not achieved in Moggi 's original work .
Third , we have demonstrated that interactions between features are reflected in liftings and that semantics can be changed by reordering monad transformers .
Finally , we have implemented our interpreter in Gofer , whose constructor classes provide just the added power over Haskell 's type classes to allow precise and convenient expression of our ideas .
This implementation includes a method for constructing extensible unions and a form of subtyping that is interesting in its own right .

Autistic children are able to interpret the mental state of others by looking at their eyes , contrary to previous research , a new University of Nottingham study has found .
In findings that contradict previous studies , psychologists found that autistic children can ‘ read ’ a stranger ’s mental state based on that person ’s eyes .
Autistic children have long been thought to be poor at interpreting people ’s mental states based on facial expressions , especially expressions around the eyes .
Some researchers believe that this lack of ability could be central to the social problems experienced by autistic children and adults .
But the latest findings cast doubt on this hypothesis .
A study at The University of Nottingham found that autistic children were able to interpret mental states when looking at animated facial expressions .
The findings also suggest that the use of moving images , rather than conventional still pictures , gives a much more accurate measure of the abilities of autistic children .
Researchers hope that by increasing understanding of autism , their findings may ultimately help in the teaching and treatment of people with the condition .
Published in the latest issue of the journal Child Development , the study was led by Dr Elisa Back .
Her co-researchers were Professor Peter Mitchell and Dr Danielle Ropar of the School of Psychology at The University of Nottingham .
Dr Back said : “ Previous findings show that children and adolescents with autism may have difficulty reading mental states from facial expressions but our results suggest that this is not due to an inability to interpret information from the eyes .
“ Surprisingly , autistic children seemed particularly reliant on the eyes and also the mouth when making mentalistic inferences .
“ The conclusions of previous research are largely based on methods that present static photographs to participants .
Our study indicates that a more accurate measure of the abilities of those with autism can be obtained through the use of sophisticated digital imaging techniques with animated facial expressions . ”
The study compared two groups of autistic children , one group aged 10 – 14 and one aged 11 – 15 , with two control groups of non-autistic children .
They underwent a series of tests to see whether they could gauge the mental state of a stranger by looking at different parts of the face .
Researchers conducted two experiments in which the participants looked at a series of facial expressions on a laptop screen .
In the facial images used , the eyes and mouth were either ‘ freeze - framed ’ in a neutral expression , or animated and expressive .
By showing a sequence of different combinations , they were able to gauge which aspects of the face were used by the autistic children to ‘ read ’ someone ’s mental state — and how successful they were .
In the second experiment , the 18 autistic children involved were as successful as non-autistic children in interpreting mental states , whether they saw the eyes in isolation or in the context of the whole face .
This indicates that autistic children do , in fact , make use of information from the eyes — a finding that contradicts prior studies .
An estimated 588,000 people have autism in the UK , according to the National Autistic Society .
A mental health survey by the Office for National Statistics found the prevalence of children and young people anywhere on the autistic spectrum is 0.9 per cent — almost one in every 100 .

ELEPHANTS are big , powerful and can be very dangerous - but they are not drunkards .
Anecdotes about African elephants going on alcohol - fuelled rampages after eating the fermented fruit of the marula tree are probably incorrect , says Steven Morris at the University of Bristol , UK .
Assuming an alcohol content of 3 per cent , his team calculates that a 3 - tonne elephant would need to eat more than 1200 fruit to get drunk .
That would require a diet solely of fermented marula fruit consumed at 400 times the normal maximum food intake .
It is more likely that " drunk " bulls are just defending a prized food source , says Morris .
The study will be published inSource - The New Scientist

UPDATE : One more for good measure .
The ferocity of Israel 's onslaught in southern Lebanon and Hizbullah 's stubborn battles against Israeli ground forces may be working in the militant group 's favor .
" They want to shatter the myth of Israeli invincibility , " says Amal Saad - Ghorayeb , a leading Lebanese expert on Hizbullah .
" Being victorious means not allowing Israel to achieve their aims , and so far that is the case . "
Still , the intensity of the Israeli bombing campaign appears to have taken Hizbullah aback .
Mahmoud Komati , the deputy head of Hizbullah 's politburo told the Associated Press , " the truth is – let me say this clearly – we did n't even expect [ this ] response ... that [ Israel ] would exploit this operation for this big war against us . "
When Hizbullah guerrillas snatched two Israeli soldiers from across the border , it appeared to be a serious miscalculation .
In the days that followed the July 12 capture , Israel unleashed its biggest offensive against Lebanon since its 1982 invasion , smashing the country 's infrastructure , creating 500,000 refugees , and so far killing more than 400 civilians .
Thursday , Israeli air and artillery strikes continued in southern Lebanon and the International Committee of the Red Cross said bodies were laying in the streets of some Lebanese border villages where fighting has trapped civilians .
Also Thursday Al Qaeda 's second in command , Ayman Zawahiri , called in a televised video for Muslims to join fighting in the Gaza Strip and Lebanon in a holy war against Israel .
While al - Qaeda is a Sunni Muslim group which in general views Shiites , who make up Hizbullah 's ranks , with disgust and not even as Muslims , they share a common hatred of Israel and the US .
In a televised address Tuesday , Hassan Nasrallah , Hizbullah 's secretary general , said the Israeli onslaught was an attempt by the US and Israel to " impose a new Middle East " in which Lebanon would be under US hegemony .
" Our fate is to confront this plan ... we are waging a war for the liberation of the remaining occupied lands and the liberation of our detainees , " Mr. Nasrallah said .
Ms. Saad - Ghorayeb says that Hizbullah 's goals have changed , " assuming a wider strategic importance " in which the party is at the forefront of opposition to the Bush administration 's agenda of transforming the Middle East into a series of pro-Western democracies .
" Hizbullah is in a unique position to confront the US agenda which if successful will be , by extension , a victory for Syria , Iran and Hamas , " she says .
Hizbullah's top guerrilla fighters are mounting a stubborn campaign against the region 's most powerful army in and around Bint Jbail , the largest Shiite town in the border district where support for the party runs high .
Hizbullah has had six years – ever since Israel withdrew from south Lebanon – to prepare for this climactic showdown .
Instead of storing weapons and ammunition in vulnerable stockpiles , they are scattered throughout the south in natural caves , tunnels , and homes .
Hizbullah officials say they have sufficient ammunition and high morale tofight for months .
Hizbullah 's frontline fighters are battle - hardened veterans after fighting Israeli forces in the 1990s .
They are armed with advanced Russian antitank missiles , which have proved deadly against Israel 's vaunted Merkava tanks and use classic hit - and - run guerrilla tactics .
" Hizbullah is doing what it does best , harassing the enemy , " says Timur Goksel , who served 24 years with the UN peacekeeping force in south Lebanon .
Indeed , Nasrallah has announced the launch of the " second phase of our struggle " in which his long - range rockets would " go beyond Haifa , " Israel 's third–largest city .
Israeli officials have been bracing for possible rocket attacks on Tel Aviv , which would mark a major escalation in the conflict .
" If Hizbullah hits Tel Aviv , I think that Israel will totally wipe off the map Bint Jbail , Khiam , Tyre and Nabatieh , " says Nizar Abdel - Kader , a columnist for Ad - Diyar newspaper and a retired Lebanese army general .
The stakes are high for Hizbullah , but it seems it can count on an unprecedented swell of public support that cuts across sectarian lines .
According to a poll released by the Beirut Center for Research and Information , 87 percent of Lebanese support Hizbullah 's fight with Israel , a rise of 29 percent on a similar poll conducted in February .
More striking , however , is the level of support for Hizbullah 's resistance from non-Shiite communities .
Eighty percent of Christians polled supported Hizbullah along with 80 percent of Druze and 89 percent of Sunnis .
Lebanese no longer blame Hizbullah for sparking the war by kidnapping the Israeli soldiers , but Israel and the US instead .
The latest poll by the Beirut Center found that 8 percent of Lebanese feel the US supports Lebanon , down from 38 percent in January .
" This support for Hizbullah is by default .
It 's due to US and Israeli actions , " says Saad - Ghorayeb , whose father , Abdo , conducted the poll .
The most favorable outcome for Hizbullah , analysts say , is to keep harassing Israel until there is a cease - fire agreement that essentially leaves Hizbullah intact .
If Israel establishes an occupation zone along the border to police the area , Hizbullah will likely continue fighting , unhindered by a weakened Lebanese government and backed by a radicalized Shiite community .
That growing radicalization is palpable in this laid - back coastal town where support for Hizbullah traditionally has been arbitrary .
Ghassan Farran , a doctor and head of a local cultural organization , gazes in disbelief at the pile of smoking ruins which was once his home .
Minutes earlier , an Israeli jet dropped two guided missiles into the six - story apartment block in the centre of Tyre .
" Look what America gives us , bombs and missiles , " says this educated , middle–class professional .
" I was never a political person and never with Hizbullah but now after this I am with Hizbullah . "

One of the main differences between humans and other animals is our larger brain size — but what prompted and guided this growth ?
Wanting to better understand the origins of human uniqueness , scientists from the University of Tennessee have recently modeled the evolution of the brain , based on previous explanations of intelligence as the individual ’s quest to achieve greater social and reproductive success .
“ One of the two challenges in this research was to find a mathematical representation of verbal arguments underlying the Machiavellian intelligence hypothesis , ” co-author Sergey Gavrilets told PhysOrg.com .
“ Second , we had to perform a thorough numerical study of the mathematical model that we built , which required using a very large number of powerful computers .
We found that the mathematical model strongly supports previous verbal arguments , which adds a lot of credibility to the latter . ”
Acknowledging that their model base is controversial , scientists Gavrilets and co-author Aaron Vose focused primarily on the effects of social factors on the evolution of brain size ( other possible factors include climate and ecology ) .
Sometimes called “ Machiavellian intelligence , ” the hypothesis suggests that social power and competition for mates was driving human males to invent strategies that increase cerebral capacity on an evolutionary timescale .
( The current study neglected females for simplicity . )
In their model , Gavrilets and Vose described “ intelligence ” as “ the ability to learn and use different ideas to the individual ’s own benefit . ”
Two factors defined intelligence in the study : “ learning ability , ” which is how easily a brain learns new strategies ; and “ cerebral capacity , ” which measures the number of different ideas that a brain can learn and use .
These traits get passed on genetically , with the more socially intelligent humans winning mates and reproducing more offspring , who inherit their progenitors ’ intelligent genes .
Secondary benefits of a complex brain include technological , linguistic , environmental and other skills .
Three phases of evolutionary intelligence
According to their model simulation , which ran through about 30,000 generations of humans , Gavrilets and Vose identified three phases of the dynamics of intelligence .
In the “ dormant phase , ” the only route to an individual ’s increased intelligence is to invent an idea in his lifetime .
However , large brains are advantageous only if they also have learned some ideas which are not happening during the dormant phase .
“ The dormant phase is when nothing much happens , ” said Gavrilets .
“ In a sense , this is a default state from which we start simulations . ”
Not until the “ cognitive explosion phase ” — 5 to 20 thousand generations later — does increased learning ability and cerebral capacity offer advantages .
At this time , much of the population has received both genes , promoting rapid expansion of the ideas .
Interestingly , the scientists found that cerebral capacity evolves more rapidly than learning ability , suggesting that potential is more important than ability .
Also , even though complex ideas are more beneficial for the population , individuals largely gain simple ideas during this phase — which was a surprise to the scientists .
“ [ T ] he complexity of memes [ ideas ] present in the population does not increase but , on the contrary , decreases in time , ” the scientists wrote in their study .
“ This happens as a result of intense competition among memes : whereas complex memes give advantage to individuals on a longer ( biological ) time scale , they lose competition to simpler memes on a shorter ( social ) time scale . ”
After a while , though , the increasing brain becomes difficult to afford , partly due to high - risk births as well as energy consumption .
Although accounting for only 2 % of the body weight , the brain uses about 20 % of a resting body ’s metabolism .
Therefore , cerebral expansion cannot last forever , and a “ saturation phase ” occurs , usually a couple hundred thousand generations later .
Throughout this process , natural selection causes a competition between simple and complex ideas , where simple ideas always win because they spread easier .
Other conditions that emerge in this phase promote postponing brain growth until after birth , and reducing the size of the guts .
Diminishing IQ - sex correlation
Historically , males with greater social intelligence generate more offspring , corresponding with the evolution of more intelligent humans .
In modern times , however , it ’s fairly obvious that intelligence and reproductive fecundity do n’t generally correlate .
This change , the scientists found , along with exposure to a large number of ideas , could throw a curve ball to evolution ’s increasingly intelligent humans .
“ As the extent to which social success translates into reproductive success declines in modern societies , cognitive abilities are expected to be significantly reduced by natural selection , ” the scientists wrote in their study .
This was also one of the most eyebrow - raising results for Gavrilets .
“ Surprisingly , the competition for social / reproductive success was a very large driving force in the whole process , ” he said .
“ Personally , I did n’t expect to find that the model would predict a reduction in intelligence . ”
The Human Uniqueness Factor
Before trying to relate these dynamics to our modern society , however , Gavrilets and Vose caution that they did not develop this model for direct application to the history of Homo sapiens .
Rather , the model combines several explanations for human brain size , and determines the outcome when taken together .
As Gavrilets explained , the model has identified key parameters , factors ( e.g. , competition for reproductive success ) , patterns ( e.g. , the three phases ) , and time scales ( 10 to 20 thousand generations ) for human brain evolution .
Still , the scientists are n’t sure why these large brain dynamics occurred for humans , but not other animals .
“ This is ‘ The Question ’ , Gavrilets said .
“ There is not much agreement on this in the scientific literature .
Alexander and others argue that the fact that humans managed to reach a state of ‘ ecological dominance ’ was crucial .
To me , Alexander 's arguments make a lot of sense .
Others will strongly disagree and will interpret the data differently . ”

( 2006.02.19 ) BSD 系OS でのスタック領域情報の取得の仕方を追 加
初めに
C/C++ でプログラムをしているとつい忘れてしまうのがスレッドのスタックオーバーフローの問題。
最近の OS はスレッド当たり 2〜8MB のスタック領域を持っているため、よほどのことがない限りスタックが溢れてしまうことはない。 だが、再帰や alloca を積極的に使うようなプログラムではスタックオーバーフローを気にすべきだ。 スタックのオーバーフローが起きた場合でもプログラム中で事故処理を行い、適切にリカバリーできるようにしたい。
一般的な OS ではスレッドが生成された時に所定のサイズの仮想メモリ空間が割り付けられる。 これがスタックが取りうる最大サイズになる。 実際には、仮想メモリの仕組みを利用してスタックの最初のページにだけ実メモリが割り付けられる。 実行が進みスタックが伸びてくるとメモリが割り当てられていないメモリページへアクセスが起きる。
CPU はアクセスバイオレーションの例外を発効し、それを
OS がハンドリングしてスタックの未マップ領域にメモリを割り当てることになる。 このスタック管理 は
Windows 、Solaris 、Linux ではユーザープロセスからは隠蔽されている。
そしてスレッドに割り当てられたスタックの最大サイズを越えてアクセスが発生しそうになった場合には、UNIX 系では SEGV シグナル 、Win32 API では EXCEPTION_STACK_OVERFLOW
構造化例外がスローされる。
この文書では主に UNIX 系 OS ( Linux 、Solaris ) でスタックオーバーフローをハンドリングする方法について述べる。
WindowsNT 系についても少しだけ書く。
以下に出てくるサンプルは C++ 言語です。
1. 代替シグナルスタック ( Alternate Signal Stack )
UNIX 系 OS でスタックオーバーフローをハンドリングのためには SEGV シグナルを補足する必要がある。 現在の UNIX 系 OS はスタックオーバーフローを起こしたスレッド自身が SEGV シグナルを補足するようにできている( ものがほとんどだ ) 。 しかし、シグナルハンドラ処理はシグナルを補足したスレッドのスタックを利用するため、いざ
SEGV 例外が発生した場合には、シグナルハンドラを呼び出すスタックフレームを置くメモリがないということになる。
この問題に対処するために UNIX 系 OS では 代替シグナルハンドラ ( alternate signal stack ) の機構を用意している。 これはシグナルハンドラが予め用意された通常とは異なるスタックを使用する機構である。
Linux / Solaris では代替シグナルスタックは明示的に設定を行った時にのみ利用される。
Windows では同様の機構がデフォルトで用意されている。
#include < stdio.h > # include < stdlib.h > # include < signal.h >
# define ALT_STACK_SIZE
( 4096*8 ) # define ALLOCA_SIZE ( 1024*2 ) /* シグナルハンドラ */ static void signal_handler ( int sig , siginfo_t * sig_info , void* sig_data ) { if ( sig == SIGSEGV ) { fprintf ( stderr , " SEGV : %p
" , sig_info -> si_addr ) ; fflush ( stderr ) ; exit ( 1 ) ; } /* ここで位置で以前に登録されたシグナルハンドラを
呼び出す処理を行ってもよい。 */ } /* わざとスタックオーバーフローを発生させる */ static void cause_stack_overflow ( ) { cause_stack_overflow ( ) ; } /* メイン関数 */ int main ( int argc , char ** argv ) {
/* 代替シグナルスタックのセット */ stack_t ss ; /* alternative signal stack としてメモリを確保 */ ss.ss_sp = malloc( ALT_STACK_SIZE ) ; ss.ss_size = ALT_STACK_SIZE
; ss.ss_flags = 0 ; if ( sigaltstack ( &ss , NULL ) ) { /* error */ fprintf ( stderr , " Failed sigaltstack
" ) ; exit ( 1 ) ; } /* シグナルハンドラのセット */ struct sigaction newAct , oldAct ; /* 古いシグナルハンドラを退避 */ if ( sigaction ( SIGSEGV , NULL , &oldAct ) == - 1 ) { /* error */ fprintf ( stderr , " Failed to acquire the current sigaction_t .
" ) ; exit ( 1 ) ; } /* 新しいシグナルハンドラをセット */ sigemptyset(&newAct.sa_mask ) ; sigaddset ( &newAct.sa_mask , SIGSEGV ) ; newAct.sa_sigaction = signal_handler ; newAct.sa_flags = SA_SIGINFO|SA_RESTART|SA_ONSTACK ; if ( sigaction ( SIGSEGV , &newAct , NULL ) == - 1 ) { /* error */ fprintf ( stderr , " Failed to set my signal handler .
" ) ; exit ( 1 ) ; } /* わざとスタックオーバーフローを発生させる */ cause_stack_overflow ( ) ; return 0 ; }
この時点ではまだシグナルをハンドラしただけで、スタックオーバーフローに対処したとはいえない。
以下のような問題がある。
SEGV はスタックオーバーフロー以外でも送出されるので、 スタックオーバーフローとそうでない場合の切り分けが必要。
( Windows では EXCEPTION_STACK_OVERFLOW と EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION
は 区別される )
( Windows では と は 区別される ) 実際のプログラムでは シグナルハンドラ内ですべての問題に対処するわけには行かないので、 もう一度スタックオーバーフローを起こしたコンテキストに戻る必要がある。
だが、 元のコンテキストに戻ると代替シグナルスタックは効かないので スタックオーバーフローのままである 。
この問題は Windows でも存在する ( が、Windows では少しだけ楽をして対処可能 ) 。
だが、 元のコンテキストに戻ると代替シグナルスタックは効かないので スタックオーバーフローのままである。 この問題 は
Windows でも存在する ( が、Windows では少しだけ楽をして対処可能 ) 。 スタックオーバーフローが発生した場所とは
異なる場所から実行を再開したい場合がある。
特定のバージョンの Linux ではこのコードは正しく動作しない。 その原因 を Part 2 で述べる 。
2. スタック領域情報の取得
スレッドのスタックがメモリ上のどこにあるか判定する方法について述べる。
2.1 Linux
Linux のスタック事情は大変複雑だ 。
Linux のスレッドの特性は、使用されるスレッドライブラリによって大きく変わってくる。 現在までに以下のようなライブラリが使用されてきた ( はず ) 。
種類 特徴 ディストリビューション libc5 ( 筆者はこの時代のことは良く知らない ) 古い Slackware など glibc2 LinuxThreads
( fixed stack ) スレッドを同一メモリ空間を共有する 複数のプロセスとして実装。 管理スレッドを必要とする 。
マルチスレッド使用時の スタックサイズが 2 MB に固定。 RedHat Linux v7.0 以前
Debian
Vine Linux 2.6 以前 LinuxThreads
( floating stack ) スレッドを同一メモリ空間を共有する 複数のプロセスとして実装。 管理スレッドを必要とする 。
マルチスレッド使用時の スタックサイズを自由に選択できる。 RedHat Linux v7.1 〜 v8
RedHat Linux AS v2.1 以前 NPTL カーネルレベルでのスレッドのサポート。
管理スレッドが不要 に
シグナルが POSIX 準拠に
同期オブジェクトのカーネルサポート
同一プロセスのスレッドが同じプロセ スIDを持つようになった。 マルチスレッド使用時の スタックサイズを自由に選択できる。 RedHat Linux v9 以降
RedHat Enterprise Linux v3 以降
現在では libc5 は使われなくなっているので、さすがに気にしなくてもよいと思われる。
glic2 では大きく分けて 2 種類 Linux スレッド ( LinuxThreads ) と Native POSIX スレッドライブラリ ( NPTL ) がある 。
NPTL は最近になって出てきた ちゃんとした POSIX スレッドライブラリ で比較的問題は少ない。 よって NPTL では Part1 のコードは正常に動作する 。
LinuxThreads もバージョン間でずいぶん仕様が異なっている。 まず 、LinuxTheads のバージョンによって fixed stack と floating stack に二分される。 fixed stack は、スタックのサイズが 2MB に固定されていて変更不能である。 floating stack は、スタックサイズを変更することが可能になっている 。
Linux のスレッドライブラリの最大の問題は、現在システムにインストールされているスレッドライブラリがどのようなバージョン・種類なのか明示的に確認する方法がないことだ(例えばスレッドライブラリをバージョン番号を返す API などがあればよいのだが ) 。
スレッドライブラリの特定には、いささか ad hock な手法を使う必要がある 。
スレッドを使用しないプロセス まずスレッドを使用しない Linux プロセスは、 プロセスに 1 つだけのスレッドを持っている 。
この場合のプロセスのスタックは、 仮想メモリ空間のアドレス 0xC0000000 から始まり下向きに伸びてゆく。 プロセスのスタックサイズはリソースによって決定され、 tcsh では limit stacksize < n > 、 bash では ulimit -s < n > を指定することで変更できる。
デフォルトのスタックサイズは 8192 K なので [ 0xB800000,0xC0000000 ) が スタックサイズになる。 リソースリミットからスタックサイズを取得するには 以下のように getrlimit を用いる 。
rlim.rlim_cur にスタックサイズがバイト数で格納される。 struct rlimit rlim ; getrlimit( RLIMIT_STACK , &rlim ) ; fixed stack の
LinuxThreads プロセスがスレッドを使う場合、libpthread .so をアタッチする。 この共有ライブラリがプロセスにアタッチされると、 スタックの使用の仕方が変わる。 libpthread .
so がアタッチされると、 プロセス起動時にあったスレッド(? ) がメインスレッドとなる。 そしてメインスレッドのサイズの上限が 2MB に制限される 。
ただしリソースリミットを指定することで、 メインスレッドのスタックサイズを 2MB から減らすことは可能。
ただしリソースリミットを指定することで、 メインスレッドのスタックサイズを 2MB から減らすことは可能。 pthread_create を使って新しいスレッドを作成すると、
0xC0000000 から下のアドレス空間に 2MB のメモリを確保し、 新しいスレッドのスタックとする。
新たに作られたスレッド ( 以後、派生スレッドと呼ぶことにする ) は リソースリミットのスタックサイズ指定の影響を受けない。 fixed stack は古い Linux スレッドの設計で、 スタックのサイズを 2MB に固定し 2MB 境界に揃えて配置する。 そのため fixed stack では ( SP レジスタの値 ) & ( 2MB - 1 ) を 計算することでスタック領域を識別することができる。 この 「 スタックレジスタからスタック領域判定でき、
そこからスレッドも識別もできる」という
特性を利用してしまったライブラリがある ( らしい ) 。 そのため SP レジスタを固定の 2MB の以外の場所に変更すると エラーとなる可能性がある。 この制約は 代替シグナルスタックの使用方法とバッディング する 。
これは このような hack で回避することが可能。 floating stack の
LinuxThreads floating stack の LinuxThreads も libpthread .
so の形で提供されている。 プロセスが libpthread .
so をアタッチすることでスレッドの使用が始まる。 floating stack の場合には、 リソースリミットで制限したプロセスのスタックサイズが デフォルトのスタックサイズとなる ( デフォルトは 8192 K のことが多い ) 。
そのため libpthread .
so 前のプロセススタックが、 メインスレッドのスタックになると考えてよい。
そのため libpthread .
so 前のプロセススタックが、 メインスレッドのスタックになると考えてよい。 pthread_create を使って新しいスレッドを作成すると、 0xC0000000 から下のアドレス空間の中に指定サイズのメモリを取って 新しいスレッドのスタックとする 。
指定がない場合にはデフォルト値が採用される。 floating stack ではスタックを 2MB 境界に置かねばならないという制限はない。 NPTL NPTL はスタック周辺の動作は floating stack と同様 。
このような複数のスタックシステムを区別しながら、動的にスタックのサイズを取得するためには以下のような方法を用いればよい。
pthread_getattr_np を使用したスタック領域情報の取得 POSIX にはスレッドのアトリビューションから スタックの位置とサイズを読み取 る
API pthread_attr_getstackaddr 、 pthread_attr_getstacksize が用意されている。 ただスレッドアトリビューションは スレッドを新規に作成するときに与えるものであって、
実行中に動的に取得することは ( POSIX の仕様上は ) できない。 ただし glibc の特定バージョンからは、 POSIX の仕様外の API として 動作中のスレッドからスレッドアトリビューションを取得する pthread_getattr_np が用意された。 これを用いてスタック領域の取得にせまる。 fixed stack と floating stack の判別方法 まず floating stack が実装されたの は LinuxThreads v0.9 以降である 。
pthread_getattr_np API は、 このバージョンから実装されている 。
そこで共有ライブラリ中から dlsym API を用いてシンボルを探すことで、 現在稼動しているシステムに pthread_getattr_np が存在するかどうかをチェックする。 pthread_getattr_np がなければ fixed stack であると断定できる。 typedef int ( * PTHREAD_GETATTR_NP_FUNC ) ( pthread_t , pthread_attr_t *) ; PTHREAD_GETATTR_NP_FUNC
pthread_getattr_np_func = NULL ; pthread_getattr_np_func = ( PTHREAD_GETATTR_NP_FUNC ) dlsym( RTLD_DEFAULT , " pthread_getattr_np " ) ; if ( pthread_getattr_np_func != NULL ) { // floating stack } else { // fixed stack } ただし LinuxThreads をビルドする際に、 オプションで fixed stack を選ぶことも可能である 。
そのため pthread_getattr_np が存在した場合に必ず floating stack であるとは限らない 。 Debian や Vine Linux 2.6 は 新しい glibc / LinuxThreads を採用していても fixed stack になっている。 今のところシステムのスレッドライブラリが floating stack なのか、 それとも fixed stack なのかを見分ける確実な方法はないようだ。 pthread_getattr_np の問題 pthread_getattr_np API が存在する場合、 以下のようなプログラムを使用すると スタックの開始ポイント( 最下位アドレス ) とサイズを取得できる。 pthread_attr_t attr ; if ( pthread_getattr_np_func(pthread_self ( ) , &attr ) ) { fprintf ( stderr , " Failed pthread_getattr_np ( ) .
" ) ; fflush ( stderr ) ; exit ( 2 ) ; } void * stack_base = 0 ; size_t stack_size = 0 ; // Method 1. pthread_attr_getstackaddr( &attr , & stack_base ) ; pthread_attr_getstacksize( &attr , & stack_size ) ; // Method 2. pthread_attr_getstack ( &attr , & stack_base , & stack_size ) ; ただし、 この pthread_getattr_np によってアトリビューションが正しく取得できるのは派生スレッドのみで、 メインスレッド pthread_getattr_np を使っても不正確な値しか手に入らない 。
メインスレッドだけはリソースリミットからスタックサイズを得る必要がある。 注意！
スタックハンドラ内で pthread_getattr_np を使用した場合、 代替シグナルスタックを使っている場合でも ( 代替でない ) ノーマルなスタック情報が手に入る。 メインスレッドのスタックサイズ メインスレッドのスタックサイズを取得するには、 プロセススタックと同様に getrlimit API によって リソースリミットを取得する。 floating stack の場合には プロセススタックサイズ ＝ メインスレッドスタックサイズとなるため rlim.rlim_cur の値がそのまま使える ( リソースリミット で 8192 KB を指定すれば 8192 * 1024 が入っている ) 。 fixed stack の場合には、 スタックサイズからガード領域のサイズが引いた値が返ってくる。 これは libpthread .
so アタッチ後のスタックサイズに近い値となる。
スタックガード領域 は Part 3 で説明するが、 通常 1 仮想記憶ペー ジ。x86 / Linux では 4 kB なため getrlimit から取得できるスタックサイズは 2044KB と出る。 メインスレッドのスタック開始位置は固定 ( 0xC0000000 ) である 。
以上をまとめると 、Linux のスタックの位置とサイズを求めるプログラムは以下のようになる。
2.2 Solaris
Solaris の場合は thr_stksegment を使用する 。
#include < thread.h > # include < sys/ signal.h >
/* スタック領域情報の格納先となる*/ stack_t st ; if ( thr_stksegment ( &st ) == 0 ) { /* スタックの天井 ( スタック領域の上限となるアドレス ) */ char * stack_base = ( char * ) st.ss_sp ; /* スタックの底 ( スタック領域の下限となるアドレス ) */ char * stack_end = ( char * ) st.ss_sp - st.ss_size ; }
バージョン 8 以前の Solaris には、 メインスレッドで thr_stksegment を複数回呼ぶと正しく結果を返さないバグがあったようだ。 メインスレッド内で thr_stksegment を呼ぶのは 1 回だけに抑えた方がよい 。
2.3 Windows
Windows の場合は、 スタック情報は各スレッド毎に存在する thread information block ( TIB ) に記述されている。 以下のようなコードでアクセス可能( ソースコードは VC を想定 ) 。
/* TIB を取得する関数 */ NT_TIB * getTIB ( void ) { NT_TIB * pTib ; __asm { mov eax , dword ptr FS : [ 18H ] ; mov pTib , eax ; } return pTib ; } /* スタック領域の判定 */ NT_TIB * pTIB = getTIB ( ) ; printf ( " [ %08 x %08 x ]
" , pTIB -> StackBase , pTIB-> StackLimit ) ;
NT_TIB の詳細は プラットフォーム SDK や Visual Studio の インクルードファイル中にある WinNT.h を参考に 。
2.4 FreeBSD 、OpenBSD、MacOS
X
BSD 系 OS でもスタック領域情報の取得の仕方はバラバラのようだ。 以下のような _np のサフィックスのついた API が用意されている 。
OS API インクルードファイ ル FreeBSD pthread_attr_get_np pthread_np.h OpenBSD pthread_stackseg_np(3 ) pthread_np.h & sys/ signal.h MacOS X pthread_get_stacksize_np
pthread_get_stackaddr_np pthread.h
以下は MacOS X と FreeBSD でのコード例 。
#include < pthread.h > int get_macosx_stack_info( void** stackaddr , size_t* stacksize ) { size_t size = pthread_get_stacksize_np(pthread_self ( ) ) ; void * addr = pthread_get_stackaddr_np(pthread_self ( ) ) ; * stackaddr = ( char * ) addr - size ; * stacksize = size ; return 0 ; }
#include < pthread_np.h > int get_freebsd_stack_info(void** stackaddr , size_t* stacksize ) { int ret = 0 ; pthread_attr_t attr ; if ( ( ret = pthread_attr_init ( &attr ) ) == 0 ) { ret = pthread_attr_get_np( pthread_self ( ) , &attr ) || pthread_attr_getstackaddr( &attr , & stackaddr ) || pthread_attr_getstacksize( &attr , & stacksize ) ; pthread_attr_destroy ( &attr ) ; } return ret ; }
3. スタックのユーザー制御
Part 1 の代替シグナルスタックを設定し 、SEGV シグナルを補足したシグナルハンドラ内で
Part 2 の判定を行えば、スタックオーバーフローを補足できる。 この後、シグナルハンドラ内で exit / abort するような終了処理を行うのであれば、スタックオーバーフローハンドリングは
Part 2 までの処理でおしまい。 しかし、スタックオーバーフローが発生した時に何らかの処理をした後に元のコンテキストに戻りたい場合には、さらに工夫が必要になる。
シグナル発生後の処理の継続方法としては、以下の二通りの方法が考えられる。
( a) シグナルハンドラー内 で 「 スタックオーバーフローが発生しましたよ」という警告フラグを立てておいてシグナルハンドラを脱出。
元のコンテキストに戻って処理を再開。
( b ) 通常のコンテキストの再開ポイントを sigsetjmp を使って記録しておき、 シグナルハンドラ内で siglongjmp を 使ってそこにジャンプすることで再開する 。
まず ( a ) の実現方法について説明する。 だが、その前にスタックオーバーフローが発生する機構を再考してみる。
スタックオーバーフローは 「 スタック領域が溢れて(越えて)しまった」というニュアンスがあるが、大概の
OS ではスタックオーバーフローの不正アクセス例外はスタック領域の中で発生するように実装されている。
OS またはスレッドライブラリはスタック領域の最後 ( 普通はスタック領域の最下位アドレス ) に仮想記憶 1 ページ分の ガード領域 を設けていて、このページの属性を読み込み・書き込み・実行に設定する。 スタックが伸びようとしてガード領域と接触した場合SEGV シグナルが発生し、 「 もうこれ以上はスタックは伸ばせません」ということが通知される。
独自のガード領域の設定
( a) の実現方法のために、ユーザーがガード領域を自由に設定する方法を考える。
(1) システム定義ガード領域のサイズの確認 まず POSIX に準拠するスレッドライブラリの場合、 スタックの最終ページをガード領域として設定しているはずである。 このような システム定義ガード領域 と呼ぶことにする。 このシステム定義ガード領域の大きさを何らかの方法によって予め調べておく。
＃ Pthread ライブラリのバージョンによっては、 pthread_attr_getguardsize API を用いて動的に取得できる。 ( 2 ) ユーザー定義ガード領域の設定 ユーザー独自のガード領域は、 システム定義ガード領域の直上の領域に 仮想記憶ページの整数倍となるように設定する。 i486 / Linux の場合、 スタック領域は上位アドレスから下位アドレスに向けて 実メモリを貼り付けていくので、 この時点ではユーザーガード領域と定めた領域には 実メモリが貼り付けられていない 。
ここで mmap API を用いて強制的に実メモリをり付けてしまう。 この時、 ページの属性を PROT_NONE ( 読み・書き・実行禁止 ) に設定してしまう。 スタックとして使える領域 ユーザー定義ガード領域 システム定義ガード領 域
( 3 ) ユーザーガード領域内でのアクセスバイオレーション
実行がはじまりスタックが激しく消費されると、
ユーザー定義ガード領域までスタックが伸びる。
ユーザー定義ガード領域は すでに実メモリが貼り付けてあるが、 属性が読み・書き・実行禁止のため SEGV シグナルが発生する 。
( 4 ) シグナルハンドラで補足 シグナルハンドラ内で SEGV シグナルを確認し、 アクセスエラーの発生アドレスから ユーザー定義ガード領域内でアクセスバイオレーションが発生したことを確認する。
確認ができれば mprotect API で ユーザー定義領域のアクセス権 を PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE など 必要な属性に変更する。 また、 この SEGV シグナルは真のスタックオーバーフローの予兆的なシグナルなので、 ここからユーザー独自のスタックオーバーフロー処理を開始する。 ( 5 ) 処理の再開 シグナルハンドラを脱出すれば アクセスバイオレーションが発生した位置から処理が再開する。
アクセスページの権限を変更したので、 ユーザー定義ガード領域は通常のスタック領域に戻っていて
実行を再開することが可能である。
以上のような流れで、ユーザー定義ガード領域を使ったシグナルハンドリングを行えばよい。
ただし、この方法ではユーザー定義ガード領域は通常のスタック領域に戻ったままなので、どこかのポイントでユーザー定義ガード領域は再設定する必要がある。
下の例では元々 スレッドが持っていたスタック下半分を独自に制御している( 完全なコードは StackOverflowHandling_linux.cpp を参照のこと ) 。
/* スタック領域を取得する */ get_linux_stack_info(( void**) &stackaddr , &stacksize ) ; /* スタックの中に独自のガード領域を設定する
ここではオリジナルのスタックの下半分をガード領域とする。 */ start_new_guard = stackaddr + SYSTEM_GUARD_PAGE_SIZE
; end_new_guard = stackaddr + ( stacksize / 2 ) ; /* アライメントを合わせる */ start_new_guard = ( char * ) ((( intptr_t)start_new_guard + VM_PAGE_SIZE -1 ) &(~( VM_PAGE_SIZE - 1 ) ) ) ; end_new_guard = ( char * ) ((( intptr_t) end_new_guard ) &(~( VM_PAGE_SIZE - 1 ) ) ) ; /* スタックの中に実メモリをコミットする。この際、アクセス権限を
PROT_NONE にする */ if ( mmap( start_new_guard , end_new_guard - start_new_guard , PROT_NONE , MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_ANONYMOUS , - 1 , 0 ) == ( void * ) - 1 ) { fprintf ( stderr , " faield mmap
" ) ; fflush ( stderr ) ; exit ( 1 ) ; } printf ( " New guard area : [ % p , % p )
" , start_new_guard , end_new_guard ) ; /* わざとスタックオーバーフローを発生させる */ cause_stack_overflow ( ) ; /* シグナルハンドラ */ static void signal_handler ( int sig , siginfo_t * sig_info , void* sig_data ) { if ( sig == SIGSEGV & sig_info -> si_code == SEGV_ACCERR ) { char * address = ( char*) sig_info -> si_addr ; /* ガードエリア内で発生した SIGSEGV か */ if ( start_new_guard <= address < end_new_guard ) { /* スタックオーバーフローをハンドリング */ if ( address < start_new_guard + VM_PAGE_SIZE ) { /* ガード領域内の最後の 1 ページなのでエラーメッセージを出して停止 */ fprintf ( stderr , " Stack overflow !!
" ) ; fflush ( stderr ) ; exit ( 1 ) ; } else {
/* ユーザー制御スタック部分までスタックが伸びる */ char* start = ( char * ) ( ( ( intptr_t ) address ) &(~( VM_PAGE_SIZE - 1 ) ) ) ; printf ( " New memory mapped : [ % p , %p " , start , start + VM_PAGE_SIZE ) ; fflush ( stdout ) ; /* アクセス権を替えてユーザー制御スタックを使用可能にする */ if ( mprotect ( start , VM_PAGE_SIZE , PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE ) == - 1 ) { fprintf ( stderr , " faield mprotect
" ) ; fflush ( stderr ) ; exit ( 1 ) ; } } } } }
Linux の代替シグナル問題の解 決
Fixed stack の LinuxThreads で代替シグナルハンドラがまともに使えない問題は、これは最初に取られた
2MB のスタック領域の中に代替シグナルハンドラも入れてしまえば解決する。
つまりスタックの構成を以下のように変更してしまえばよい。
Fixed floating のスタック ( 2MB ) スタックとして使える領域 Glibc が用意するガード領 域
Alt. siganl stack を 2MB 内に挿入 スタックとして使える領域 ユーザー定義のガード領域 代替シグナルスタックを設定 Glibc が用意するガード領 域
代替シグナルスタックは mmap を使って実メモリを無理矢理貼り付ける。 この方法では Glibc が用意した通常のガード領域が使えなくなるので、代替シグナルスタックの上に新しいガード領域を作って自分で管理する必要がある。
以上を実現したサンプルプログラムは以下のようになる。
Part 4 スタックオーバーフローからの強制復帰
Part 3 で述べた ( b ) 案のように、スタックオーバーフローが発生した時に予め登録しておいた場所にジャンプし、そこから再開させる方法もある。
このジャンプは sigsetjmp / siglongjmp を用いて実現する 。
スタックオーバーフローが起こる前の場所で sigsetjmp を用いて場所を戻り場所を登録しておき、
スタックオーバーフローが起きた場合シグナルハンドラ内で siglongjmp を呼び出して元に戻る。 このプログラムの概略は次のコードのようになる。
#include < setjmp.h > # include < unistd.h > static sigjmp_buf return_point ; int main ( int argc , char ** argv ) {
/* ( ここにシグナルハンドラを登録するコードを ) */ if ( sigsetjmp( return_point , 1 ) == 0 ) { /* メインの処理 ( この中でスタックオーバーフローする ) */ } else { /* スタックオーバーフローからの戻ってきた場合の処理をここに書く */ } return 0 ; } /* Signal Handler */ static void signal_handler ( int sig , siginfo_t * sig_info , void* sig_data ) { if ( sig == SIGSEGV ) { if ( /*スタックオーバーフローと判定されたら */ ) { siglongjmp( return_point , 1 /* ここは 0 でない任意の整数 */ ) ; } } }
いくつか注意点がある。
sigsetjmp/siglongjmp の代わりに setjmp / longjmp を使わないこと。
POSIX の規約では setjmp / longjmp は シグナルマスクなどのシグナルコンテキストを 保存・復帰することを保証されない 。 Linux では setjmp/longjmp ではシグナルコンテキストが保存・復帰されるが、
Solaris などの SYSV 系では シグナルマスクの処理が放置される 。
その結果、以下のようなことが起こる。 SEGV シグナルを補足したシグナルハンドラでは、 SEGV シグナルがブロック ( マスク ) される。 シグナルハンドラ内から longjmp で戻ると シグナルマスクがそのままになる。 再度、スタックオーバーフローが起きると シグナルハンドラに飛べず Segmentation Fault で落ちる 。
/ を使わないこと。 POSIX の規約では setjmp / longjmp は シグナルマスクなどのシグナルコンテキストを 保存・復帰することを保証されない 。 Linux では setjmp/longjmp ではシグナルコンテキストが保存・復帰されるが、
Solaris などの SYSV 系では シグナルマスクの処理が放置される。 その結果、以下のようなことが起こる。 siglongjmp 呼び出し時には代替シグナルスタックの 切り替えは自動的に行われる ( 放置してよい ) 。
アクセスバイオレーションの発生したアドレス ( 仮想記憶ページ ) も放置してよい 。
Windows NT 系の場合
Windows NT 系では構造化例 外( SEH ) を用いることで、スタックオーバーフローのハンドリングは簡単に処理することができる。
例をあげる 。
/* 本文 */ __try { /* メインの処理 ( この中でスタックオーバーフローする ) */ } __except ( ExceptionHandler(( _EXCEPTION_POINTERS*)_exception_info( ) ) ) { // 例外発生時に行う特別な処理 } /* 構造化例外ハンドラ */ LONG WINAPI ExceptionHandler ( struct _EXCEPTION_POINTERS * pExceptionInfo ) { DWORD dwExceptionCode = pExceptionInfo->ExceptionRecord->ExceptionCode ; switch ( dwExceptionCode ) { // スタックオーバーフローと( 考えられる)アクセス case EXCEPTION_STACK_OVERFLOW : { PEXCEPTION_RECORD pExceptionRecord = pExceptionInfo->ExceptionRecord ; void * pAddr = ( void * ) pExceptionRecord->ExceptionInformation [ 1 ] ; /* pAddr へアクセスしたときに例外が発生している。 これに対処した後、戻り値として下の 3 つの値のいずれかを返す。 戻り値によって復帰動作が変わる。 EXCEPTION_CONTINUE_EXECUTION
例外をキャンセルし、例外を発生させた命令からやり直す。
EXCEPTION_CONTINUE_SEARCH
この例外ハンドラでは対処せず、親の例外ハンドラに処理を移す。
EXCEPTION_EXECUTE_HANDLER
この例外ハンドラで例外に対処する。__except 節の処理を実行した後、 */ } break ; // スタックオーバーフロー以外の不正アクセス case EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION : { // 不正アクセスがあったメモリアドレスの位置は
EXCEPTION_STACK_OVERFLOW
と // 同様に補足できる。 } break ; default : break ; } // 外側の _try のハンドラを探す。 return EXCEPTION_CONTINUE_SEARCH ; }
__try 〜 __except は入れ子に構造にしても構わない。 入れ子にした場合には最初に一番内側の __except 節から評価される。 そこで EXCEPTION_CONTINUE_SEARCH
を返せば、より外側の __try 〜 __except を探しに行く 。
構造化例外をハンドリングするコンテキストは、原則として例外を受けたスレッドのスタックを使用する。 ただし EXCEPTION_STACK_OVERFLOW
の場合だけは別スタックを用いるように切り替えられるようである(つまり Alternative Signal Stack が不要 ) 。
追記
( 2004/ 12/5 ) Windows NT 系の PAGE_GUARD 属性の話 Windows の VirtualProtect API は、 PAGE_READONLY 、 PAGE_READWRITE 、 PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE
など他に PAGE_GUARD 属性が存在する。 この属性を付けたページに初めてメモリアクセスすると
STATUS_GUARD_PAGE
構造化例外が発生する。 この例外はトラップしてもトラップしなくてもプログラムが続行する無害な例外で、 いったん例外を発効したページは PAGE_GUARD 属性を落したノーマルな属性へと戻る。
Windows NT 系はスレッドスタックの実装のために この PAGE_GUARD 属性を使用しており、 スタックトップに PAGE_GUARD 属性ページをおい て STATUS_GUARD_PAGE 例外をトラップするごとに スタックを伸張するということを行っている。 参考
Ask Dr. GUI # 49 ( 2004/12/22、2005/1/17 )
Linux で sigaltstack と posix スレッドを併用したときの問題点 Linux で sigaltstack ( ) をセットしたスレッドが、 pthread_create ( ) を使って pthread_attr 指定なしで子スレッドを生成すると、 親スレッドの代替シグナルスタック設定がそのままコピーされる。 このため二つのスレッドが同一の代替シグナルスタックを共有してしまい、 二つのスレッドが同時に例外を補足するとスタックを上書きしあう。 こうなると動作はまったく不定となり非常に高い確率で abort することになる。 この問題は、バージョン・ディストリビューションを問わず広く
Linux 全般に存在するようだ。 これは Linux のスレッド実装の根底にある clone システムコールが、 スレッド構造体中の代替シグナルスタックに関するメンバ変数を単純コピーしてしまうことに起因している。
POSIX 仕様としては新しいスレッドを生成した場合、 代替シグナルスタックの属性は継承してはいけな い( shall not be inherited ) とあるので、 この動作は POSIX 仕様に準拠していない 。

We had already creepy playgrounds from Russian cities here , this is a second part .
Enjoy .
And if to follow up just look at THIS .
Of course we all could imagine that drinking in Russia starts early but SO EARLY ?
And another thing :
Do you want to see another weird thing from Russia ?
A canned herring turned to be some creature with full mouth of sharp teeth …
Click on the pick above for the hole story !
Groups of people are uncannily accurate at guessing the number of beans in a jar , the weight of a steer , and the like .
In fact , the bigger the group , the more accurate its collective guess — a principle known as the Condorcet Jury Theorem .
There ’s a significant limitation , though :
This only works if each person in the group has a better than 50 % chance of getting the right answer .
If the individuals in the group have a less than 50 % chance — for instance because they know absolutely nothing about the question at hand — then increasing the size of the group will decrease the likelihood of their getting the right answer .
I learned this today by reading Ethan Zuckerman ’s interesting review of Infotopia by Cass Sunstein .
The converse of Condorcet — that groups of ignorant people make worse decisions as the size of the group increases — is Ethan ’s formulation .
I ’m not sure if either version of the theorem is borne out ( other than in pure theory and in relatively abstract test cases ) but they sure make a compelling argument for the importance of a voting public being educated and well - informed — and it ’s a significant proviso to glib statements about “ the wisdom of crowds . ”
Ignorant voters make bad decisions — worse the more of them there are .
Informed voters make good decisions — and better ones the more of them there are .

Typeful symbolic differentiation of compiled functions

In this message , we develop the `symbolic ' differentiator for a subset of Haskell functions ( which covers arithmetics and a bit of trigonometry ) .
We can write test1f x = x * x + fromInteger 1 test1 = test1f ( 2.0 : : Float ) test2 f = diff_fn test1f test2 = test2f ( 3.0 : : Float )
We can evaluate our functions _numerically_ -- and differentiate them _symbolically_ .
Partial derivatives are supported as well .
To answer Jacques Carette 's question : the type of the derivative operator ( which is just a regular function ) is diff_fn :: ( Num b , D b ) => ( forall a . D a => a -> a ) -> b -> b where the class D includes Floats .
One can add exact reals and other similar things .
The key insight is that Haskell98 supports a sort of a reflection -- or , to be precise , type - directed partial evaluation and hence term reconstructions .
The very types that are assumed of great hindrance to computer algebra and reflective systems turn out indispensable in being able to operate on even * compiled * terms _symbolically_ .
We must point out that we specifically do _not_ represent our terms as algebraic datatypes .
Our terms are regular Haskell terms , and can be compiled !
That is in stark contrast with Scheme , for example : although Scheme may permit term reconstruction under notable restrictions , that ability is not present in the compiled code .
In general , we cannot take a _compiled_ function Float -> Float and compute its derivative symbolically , yielding another Float -> Float function .
Incidentally , R5RS does not guarantee the success of type - directed partial evaluation even in the interpreted code .
Jacques Carette has mentioned `useless reflection / reification ' .
The paper ` Tag Elimination and Jones - Optimality ' by Walid Taha , Henning Makholm and John Hughes has introduced a novel tag elimination analysis as a way to remove all interpretative overhead .
In this message , we do _not_ use that technique .
We exploit a different idea , whose roots can be traced back to Forth .
It is remarkable how Haskell allows that technique .
Other features of our approach are : an extensible differentiation rule database ; emulation of GADT with type classes .
This message is the complete code .

We should point out that the terms are fully typeful .

Mul x y deriving Show > data Div x y = Div x y deriving Show > data Pow x = Pow x Int deriving Show > newtype Sin x = Sin x deriving Show > newtype Cos x =
Cos x deriving Show
We can now describe the grammar of our term representation in the following straightforward way : > instance Term ( Const a ) a where reflect ( Const a ) = const a > > instance Term ( Var a ) a where reflect _ = id > > instance ( D a , Term x a , Term y a ) =>
Term ( Add x y ) a > where > reflect ( Add x y ) = \a -> ( reflect x a ) + ( reflect y a ) > > instance ( D a , Term x a ) =>
Term ( Sin x ) a > where > reflect ( Sin x ) = sin .
reflect x
The other instances are given in the Appendix .
This is the straightforward emulation of GADT .
The function `reflect ' removes the `tags ' after the symbolic differentiation .
Actually , ` Sin ' is a newtype constructor , so there is no run -time tag to eliminate in this case .
We must stress that there is no `reify ' function .
One may say it is built into Haskell already .
We only need to declare the datatype for the reified code > data Code a = forall t. ( Show t , Term t a , DiffRules t a ) =>
Code t > instance
Show a =>
Show ( Code a ) where show ( Code t ) = show t > reflect_code ( Code c ) = reflect c inject the reified code in the D domain > instance ( Num a , D a ) => D ( Code a ) where >
Code x + Code y = Code $ Add x y > Code x - Code y = Code $ Sub x y > Code x * Code y = Code $ Mul x y > Code x / Code y = Code $ Div x y > ( Code x ) ^ n = Code $ Pow x n > sin ( Code x ) = Code $ Sin x > cos ( Code x ) = Code $ Cos x > fromInteger n = Code $ Const ( fromInteger n ) and we 're done with the first part :
We can define a function > test1f x = x * x + fromInteger 1 > test1 = test1f ( 2.0 : : Float ) we can even compile it .
At any point , we can reify it > test1 c = test1f ( Code Var :: Code Float ) and reflect it back : > test1f ' = reflect_code test1c > test1 ' = test1f ' ( 2.0 : : Float ) * Diff > test1 5.0 * Diff > test1 ' 5.0 * Diff > test1c Add ( Mul Var Var ) ( Const 1.0 )
The differentiation part is quite straightforward .
We declare a class for differentiation rules > class ( Term t a , D a ) => DiffRules t a | t -> a where > diff :: t ->
Code a
The rules are the instances of the class DiffRules > instance ( Num a , D a ) => DiffRules ( Const a ) a where > diff _ = Code $ Const 0 > > instance ( Num a , D a ) => DiffRules ( Var a ) a where > diff _ = Code $ Const 1 > > instance ( Show x , Show y , DiffRules x a , DiffRules y a ) > =>
DiffRules ( Mul x y ) a where > diff ( Mul x y ) = case ( diff x , diff y ) of > ( Code x ':: Code a , Code y') -> >
Code $ Add ( Mul ( x : : x ) y ') ( Mul x ' ( y ::y ) ) > > > instance ( Num a , Show x , DiffRules x a ) > =>
DiffRules ( Sin x ) a where > diff ( Sin x ) = case diff x of > ( Code x ':: Code a ) -> >
Code $ Mul x ' ( Cos x )
The other instances are in the Appendix .
The approach is scalable -- we may add more rules later , in other modules .
And that 's about it : > diff_code ( Code c ) = diff c > > diff_fn :: ( Num b , D b ) => ( forall a . D a => a -> a ) -> b -> b > diff_fn f = > let code = f ( Code Var ) > in reflect_code $ diff_code code the differentiation operator could not be any simpler .
We can try > test2 f = diff_fn test1 f > test2 = test2f ( 3.0 : : Float ) we can even see the differentiation result , symbolically : * Diff > diff_code test1c
Add ( Add ( Mul Var ( Const 1.0 ) ) ( Mul ( Const 1.0 ) Var ) ) ( Const 0.0 )
True , simplifications are direly needed .
Well , the full computer algebra system is a little bit too big to be developed over one evening .
Besides , I wanted to go home three hours ago .
Here 's a slightly more complex example : > test5f x = sin ( fromInteger 5 *x ) + cos( fromInteger 1/x ) > test5c = test5f ( Code Var :: Code Float ) > > test5 = test5f ( pi:: Float ) > test5d = diff_code test5 c > > test6 = diff_fn test5f ( pi:: Float )
One can evaluate the function test5f numerically , differentiate it symbolically , check the result of differentiation -- and evaluate it numerically right away .
We can even do partial derivatives : > test3f x y = ( x*y + ( ( fromInteger 5 ) * ( x ^ 2 ) ) ) / y > > test3c1 = test3f ( Code Var :: Code Float ) ( fromInteger 10 ) > > test4x y = diff_fn ( \x -> test3f x ( fromInteger y ) ) > test4y x = diff_fn ( test3f ( fromInteger x ) ) -- * Diff > test4x 1 ( 2:: Float ) -- partial derivative with respect to x -- 21.0 -- * Diff > test4y 5 ( 5:: Float ) -- partial derivative with respect to y -- - 5.0 Appendix : > instance ( D a , Term x a , Term y a ) =>

­ As soon as a living organism dies , it stops taking in new carbon .
The ratio of carbon - 12 to carbon - 14 at the moment of death is the same as every other living thing , but the carbon - 14 decays and is not replaced .
The carbon - 14 decays with its half - life of 5,700 years , while the amount of carbon - 12 remains constant in the sample .
By looking at the ratio of carbon - 12 to carbon - 14 in the sample and comparing it to the ratio in a living organism , it is possible to determine the age of a formerly living thing fairly precisely .

A formula to calculate how old a sample is by carbon - 14 dating is :
t = [ ln ( Nf / No ) / ( - 0.693 ) ] x t1/2
t = [ ln ( N f /N o ) / ( - 0.693 ) ] x t 1/2
where ln is the natural logarithm , N f /N o is the percent of carbon - 14 in the sample compared to the amount in living tissue , and t 1/ 2 is the half - life of carbon - 14 ( 5,700 years ) .
So , if you had a fossil that had 10 percent carbon - 14 compared to a living sample , then that fossil would be :
t = [ ln ( 0.10 ) / ( - 0.693 ) ] x 5,700 years
t = [ ( - 2.303 ) / ( - 0.693 ) ] x 5,700 years
t = [ 3.323 ] x 5,700 years
t = 18,940 years old
Because the half - life of carbon - 14 is 5,700 years , it is only reliable for dating objects up to about 60,000 years old .
However , the principle of carbon - 14 dating applies to other isotopes as well .
Potassium - 40 is another radioactive element naturally found in your body and has a half - life of 1.3 billion years .
Other useful radioisotopes for radioactive dating include Uranium - 235 ( half - life = 704 million years ) , Uranium - 238 ( half - life = 4.5 billion years ) , Thorium - 232 ( half - life = 14 billion years ) and Rubidium - 87 ( half - life = 49 billion years ) .
The use of various radioisotopes allows the dating of biological and geological samples with a high degree of accuracy .
However , radioisotope dating may not work so well in the future .
Anything that dies after the 1940s , when Nuclear bombs , nuclear reactors and open - air nuclear tests started changing things , will be harder to date precisely .
Why is the US press silent on Brzezinski ’s warnings of war against Iran ?
By Barry Grey in Washington DC
3 February 2007
The major national newspapers and most broadcast outlets failed even to report Thursday ’s stunning testimony by former national security adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee .
Brzezinski , national security adviser to President Jimmy Carter , is among the most prominent figures within the US foreign policy establishment .
He delivered a scathing critique of the war in Iraq and warned that the policy of the Bush administration was leading inevitably to a military confrontation with Iran which would have disastrous consequences for US imperialism .
Most significant and disturbing was Brzezinski ’s suggestion that the Bush administration might manufacture a pretext to justify a military attack on Iran .
Presenting what he called a “ plausible scenario for a military collision with Iran , ” Brzezinski laid out the following series of events : “ Iraqi failure to meet the benchmarks , followed by accusations of Iranian responsibility for the failure , then by some provocation in Iraq or a terrorist act in the US blamed on Iran , culminating in , quote / unquote , ‘ defensive ’ US military action against Iran ... ” [ Emphasis added ] .
Thus Brzezinski opined that a US military attack on Iran would be an aggressive action , presented as though it were a defensive response to alleged Iranian provocations , and came close to suggesting , without explicitly stating as much , that the White House was capable of manufacturing or allowing a terrorist attack within the US to provide a casus belli for war .
It is self - evident that such testimony at an open congressional hearing from someone with decades of experience in the US foreign policy establishment and the closest ties to the military and intelligence apparatus is not only newsworthy , but of the most immense and grave import .
Any objective and conscientious newspaper or news channel would consider it an obligation to inform the public of such a development .
Yet neither the New York Times nor the Washington Post carried so much as a news brief on Brzezinski ’s testimony in their Friday editions .
Nor did USA Today or the Wall Street Journal .
All of these publications , of course , have well - staffed Washington bureaus and regularly cover congressional hearings — especially those dealing with such burning political questions as the war in Iraq .
There is no innocent explanation for their decision to suppress this story .
The Washington Post on Thursday published a large page - two column and photo on Henry Kissinger ’s appearance the previous day before the same Senate committee .
The former secretary of state under Richard Nixon gave testimony that was generally supportive of the Bush administration ’s war policy .
Moreover , the Post ’s web edition carried an Associated Press report on Brzezinski ’s appearance .
That article introduced subtle but significant changes to Brzezinski ’s speculative scenario of the road to war with Iran which had the effect of underplaying the sharpness and urgency of Brzezinski ’s critique of the Bush administration .
It omitted the suggestion that a terrorist attack within the US could become the justification for war , and it removed the quotation marks from Brzezinski ’s talk of a “ defensive ” war against Iran .
The World Socialist Web Site on Friday telephoned the New York Times , the Washington Post , the Wall Street Journal and USA Today to ask for an explanation for their failure to report Brzezinski ’s testimony .
None of the newspapers returned our calls .
As for the television news outlets , the “ News Hour with Jim Lehrer ” on PBS showed a clip of Brzezinski laying out his war scenario before the Senate committee , without making any comment .
“ NBC Nightly News ” ignored the story entirely .
The suppression of this damning critique of the Iraq war , the conspiratorial methods of the Bush administration , and its drive to an even wider war in the Middle East is one more demonstration of the corrupt and reactionary character of the American mass media .
It indicates that the establishment media is preparing once again , as in the run-up to the invasion of Iraq , to serve as a sounding board for the administration ’s war propaganda and lies .

The German justice minister has proposed that all EU states should criminalise Holocaust denial and ban the public display of Nazi insignia , as Germany itself does .
The EU 's justice commissioner has apparently supported her .
No reasonable person will doubt their good intentions , but this would be a big mistake .
I hope and trust that other EU members will put a stop to this deeply unwise proposal , as they have to similar ones in the past .
Let me be clear about my starting - point .
The Nazi Holocaust of the European Jews was unique .
The main historical facts about it should be known by every contemporary European .
Trying to ensure that nothing like that ever again happens here in Europe ( or anywhere else in the world , insofar as that is in our power ) should be one of the fundamental aims of the EU .
As someone who came to European affairs through the study of Nazi Germany , I can say that this was a major reason for my personal commitment to what we call the European project .
That a measure is well - intended does not , however , make it wise .
The road to hell is paved with good intentions .
And this proposal is very unwise .
First of all , if passed , it would further curtail free expression - at a time when that is under threat from many quarters .
Free expression is a unique and primary good in free societies ; it 's the oxygen that sustains other freedoms .
You must therefore have very good reasons for restricting it by law .
The German justice minister , Brigitte Zypries , argues that she has such reasons .
Recalling the way in which the anti-semitic words of Hitler and others paved the way for the horrors of Nazism , she says : " This historical experience puts Germany under a permanent obligation to combat systematically every form of racism , anti-semitism and xenophobia .
And we should not wait until it comes to deeds .
We must act already against the intellectual pathbreakers of the crime " ( I translate from a speech posted on the German justice ministry 's website ) .
So this additional restriction on free expression - an EU - wide ban on Holocaust denial and Nazi insignia - is justified because it will make a significant difference to combating racism , anti-semitism and xenophobia today .
But what is the evidence for that ?
Nine EU member states currently have laws against Holocaust denial : Austria , Belgium , the Czech Republic , France , Germany , Lithuania , Poland , Romania and Slovakia .
That happens to be a list of countries with some of the strongest rightwing xenophobic parties in the EU , from France 's National Front and the Vlaams Belang in Belgium to the NPD in Germany and the Greater Romania party .
Self - evidently those parties do n't exist as a result of Holocaust denial laws .
Indeed , the existence of such parties is one of the reasons given for having the laws , but the laws have obviously not prevented their vigorous and dangerous growth .
If anything , the bans and resulting court cases have given them a nimbus of persecution , that far - right populists love to exploit .
The same thing has happened with the imprisonment of David Irving in Austria .
Six years ago Irving lost , in the British high court , a spectacular libel case that he had himself initiated against the American historian Deborah Lipstadt , who had described him as " one of the most prominent and dangerous Holocaust deniers " .
Mr Justice Gray concluded that Irving was " an active Holocaust denier " .
The last shreds of his reputation as a serious historian were torn apart - in a country that does not ban Holocaust denial .
Now , having served time in Austria for statements he made there 16 years before , he can pose as a martyr for free speech and receives renewed publicity for his calumnies .
At a press conference after his release , he reportedly endorsed the drunken anti-semitic comment of Mel Gibson that " the Jews " are responsible for all the wars in the world
Now suppose the ban on displaying Nazi insignia had already been in force EU - wide and the British courts had therefore been obliged to prosecute Prince Harry for ( offensively and idiotically ) sporting an Afrika Korps uniform and swastika armband at a friend 's fancy dress party .
What would that have done to combat Eurosceptic and xenophobic extremism in Britain ?
Nothing .
Quite the reverse : it would have been worth thousands of votes to the British National party .
And while we 're on the subject of the swastika , Hindus across Europe are protesting against the proposed ban , on the grounds that for them the swastika is an ancient symbol of peace .
Meanwhile , the German legal authorities have got themselves into a ridiculous tangle because a court in Stuttgart has convicted the manager of a mail - order company for selling T - shirts showing crossed - out and crushed swastikas .
These might be anti-fascist T - shirts , you see , but they still showed swastikas and were therefore illegal .
And so it goes on , and would go on even more if the whole EU adopted such measures .
The argument that these well - intentioned bans actually feed the flames they are meant to quench is , of course , ultimately unprovable , although circumstantial and anecdotal evidence points in that direction .
But the burden of proof is on the proponents of the ban .
In a free society , any restriction on free speech must have a compelling justification - and that is not available here .
Holocaust denial should be combated in our schools , our universities and our media , not in police stations and courts .
It is , at most , a minor contributing factor to today 's far - right racism and xenophobia , which now mainly targets Muslims , people of different skin colour , and migrants of all kinds .
Nor will today 's anti-semitism be countered most effectively by such bans ; they may , at the margins , even stoke it up , feeding conspiracy theories about Jewish power and accusations of double - standards .
Citizens of the Baltic states , who suffered so terribly under Stalin , will ask why only denial of the Holocaust should be criminalised and not denial of the gulag .
Armenians will add : and why not the genocide that our ancestors experienced at the hands of the Turks ?
And Muslims : why not cartoons of Muhammad ?
The approach advocated by the German justice minister also reeks of the nanny state .
It speaks in the name of freedom but does not trust people to exercise freedom responsibly .
Citizens are to be treated as children , guided and guarded at every turn .
Indeed , the more I look at what Zypries does and says , the more she seems to me the personification of the contemporary European nanny state .
It 's no accident that she has also been closely involved in extending German law to allow more bugging of private homes .
Vertrauen ist gut , Kontrolle ist besser ( trust is good , control is better ) .
Is n't that another mistake Germany made in the past ?
Zypries is right : we must learn the lessons of history .
But we must learn the right lessons of history , the ones relevant to a free , multicultural continent today .
" Experience shows , " writes the former attorney general of India , Soli Sorabjee , " that criminal laws prohibiting hate speech and expression will encourage intolerance , divisiveness and unreasonable interference with freedom of expression ...
We need not more repressive laws but more free speech to combat bigotry and to promote tolerance . "
True for India and true for Europe .

Still in the shadows , an artist in his own right
crumb_095_mac.jpg
Crumb is currently working on a comissioned art piece for a couple in New England .
Maxon Crumb , the once - itinerant brother of noted R. Crumb , was featured in the movie " Crumb " by Terry Zwigoff -- sitting and begging on Market Street in the lotus position , swallowing a piece of rope in his room at a fleabag Tenderloin hotel .
All the Crumb brothers , as we saw in the film , suffered considerable psychological damage at the hands of their late father .
Ten years ago this month Maxon got off welfare and started selling his paintings , mostly through gallery owner Malcolm Whyte 's website www.Word-Play.com.
He 's sold scores of his unique works , and has just finished a commission for a CD cover of music that features the " Crumb Suite for Solo Piano . "
Maxon still lives in the same hotel , but now he faces deadlines , pays taxes and no longer has time to meditate and beg for change on Market Street .

Crumb is currently working on a comissioned art piece for a couple in New England .
Maxon Crumb , the once - itinerant brother of noted R. Crumb , was featured in the movie " Crumb " by Terry Zwigoff ... more Photo : Michael Macor Photo : Michael Macor Image 1 of / 4 Caption Close Still in the shadows , an artist in his own right 1 / 4 Back to Gallery
Judging by his appearance in " Crumb , " Terry Zwigoff 's 1995 documentary about an artistic and deeply troubled family , Maxon Crumb did n't seem long for this world .
The younger brother of underground cartoonist Robert Crumb was filmed in his seedy hotel room , sitting on a bed of nails and begging for money on San Francisco sidewalks .
He looked haunted , spiritually ransacked -- done in by the family abuse that drove his oldest brother , Charles , to suicide .
[ Podcast : Edward Guthmann with Maxon Crumb . ]
Twelve years later , Maxon Crumb still resides in the same Sixth Street dump , and still maintains an extreme spartan diet -- " only plant food " -- and an ascetic spiritual practice that includes long , holy - man treks to Bolinas Ridge , where he sits in lotus position for 12 hours at a time .
But in the years since " Crumb " was released , he is no longer dependent on government assistance and has stopped panhandling and started supporting himself with his art .
His paintings -- more intricate , surreal and disturbing than Robert 's antic work -- sell for as much as $ 3,200 ; his ink drawings go for $ 1,200 .
His personal life is also enriched .
Once a recluse , Crumb , 61 , has a close kinship with Yannick Ingey , a shy , birdlike French woman whom he met when they were both panhandling downtown .
Although it's " platonic , " Crumb says , he spends several nights a week at her tiny , Zen- like Geary Street apartment and credits her with nursing him to health after he was hospitalized in 1994 for vitamin deficiency .
Yannick brings him " balance , " Crumb says .
" It just makes life more smooth . "
And Yannick , who is unemployed and has the face of a careworn mother in a Dorothea Lange Dust Bowl photo , says Crumb does the same for her .
" His simplicity , " she says when I ask her what makes Crumb unique .
" His goodness and intelligence .
...
His remoteness from the madness . "
But if all this suggests that Crumb 's rough edges are buffed to a warm glow , or that the raging madman we saw in " Crumb " now radiates a guru 's placidity , that 's not quite accurate .
True , he no longer sits on cold sidewalks with a beggar 's bowl in front of him .
He keeps his bed of nails at home , but uses it rarely .
And it 's been years , Crumb says , since he grabbed or physically harassed women in public .
In " Crumb , " he told of following a young woman into a store in the Marina district and , in a self - propelling fever of lust , pulling down her " obscenely brief shorts " to reveal buttocks " like a ripe peach . "
Today , he dismisses that behavior as " outrageous " and " bestial " -- but says he did n't feel embarrassed to see himself discussing it on film .
It was a function , he says , of coping with celibacy .
Every three weeks , Maxon Crumb swallows a long strip of purification cloth , a kriya ( yogic discipline ) that alleviates his chronic stomach pain .
That pain , he says , is the legacy of his father who , while stationed in Shanghai in 1938 , shot a beggar in the stomach .
In Crumb 's mind , that event triggered a karmic chain that still plays out in his troubled stomach .
Maxon Crumb will never live a life of convention .
He says he 's been celibate " since the mid-' 70s " and remains so " by necessity " -- because sex triggers the epileptic seizures that began when he was in sixth grade .
Crumb is a man who lives on a precipice between conscious thought and fierce , bedeviling dreams ; who uses his art , as the formerly abused child is wont to do , to confront the darker impulses in human nature .
Crumb 's first published book , " HardCore Mother , " released by CityZen Books in 2000 , is a sexual horror story of mother - daughter incest and sadism .
Illustrated with Crumb 's surreal ink drawings , the book treads a mindscape similar to Edgar Allen Poe or David Lynch : mad , unrestrained , emotionally violent .
The work of an artist scraping at the bone of his existence .
" I got two reactions , " he says of the book .
" A lot of people really got behind the subject matter .
And other people were totally outraged by it .
It just steps over a line for certain people -- and then they 're just gone . "
There 's a fearlessness in Crumb , similar to his brother Robert , that compels him to expose his id , his sexual fears and fantasies , with no concern for the marketplace .
The bottom line is that Maxon Crumb is a very odd guy with no desire -- or ability -- to duplicate the patterns of existence and thought that most of us call " normal . "
That is what makes him fascinating , and that is what makes him maddening .
Conversation with Crumb is erratic , nonlinear .
He 'll speak to a question but quickly slip into a tangent or philosophical rant .
Italicized with nervous gestures and shakes of the head , his words issue forth in a crazy rush .
In the first of three visits I paid to his tiny room at the Winsor Hotel on Sixth Street , Crumb was sitting on the dirty woven mat on his floor -- he has no furniture -- and explaining how art and money exist for him on separate tracks .
While the first feeds his spirit and intellect and supplies his life force , the second barely holds his interest .
" Money is vague if you 're poor , " he says .
He does n't know what he earns year to year , and insists he 's never made as much from his art as he did from the SSI ( Supplemental Security Income ) payments he received for 20 years .
Malcolm
Whyte , an art dealer who has sold Crumb 's work for 10 years , says Crumb has never made more than $ 15,000 in a year .
For several years , Crumb says , " I was doing a little over $ 6,000 a year . "
Breaking free of government assistance was a good move , " but I do n't know if the way I 'm living would be less socially acceptable or less understood by most people than if I was actually on welfare . "
On the floor , propped up by a pair of bricks , is a painting commissioned by a Connecticut couple who admire Crumb 's work .
Both figures are exaggerated , in a comic , grotesque way , by buck teeth and craning necks .
The man is broad - chested and formidable and holds the woman in his hand like a pencil .
She is naked , with one marionette - like arm upraised .
Her aureolas are surrounded by concentric circles so that her breasts resemble marksmanship targets .
Each work takes weeks , perhaps months to complete , " depending on the depth of the project , " Crumb says .
During that time , he 'll go into a creative fugue and sometimes stop eating altogether .
The world drops away .
The making of art eclipses every mundane concern .
" I know it 's absolutely ridiculous , " Crumb says at one point .
" I could be making thousands more .
...
It 's not so much that I produce real slowly .
( But ) you can see the detail of my work , which obviously takes more time . "
As Crumb works on the portrait of the Connecticut couple and Chronicle photographer Michael Macor shoots him , an anguished voice reaches the fourth - floor room from the alley below .
A man is threatening to kill another man , but Crumb , who probably hears similar imprecations daily , works steadily and calmly , impervious to the shouting .
His room at the Winsor Hotel , home for the past 26 years , is filthy .
The plaster is coming down in sheets , and layers of dust and grease cover the floor .
Books on poetry , art and computer programming sit in piles ; so does his collection of meditation audiocassettes .
There 's a clunky Underwood typewriter ; various computer parts ; a monk - like arrangement of food ( half an avocado , ginger root ) , bowls and dirty silverware .
It 's the home of someone unencumbered by the material .
Crumb , who enjoys the opportunity to talk , is wearing Army camouflage jeans and a loose green shirt , unbuttoned .
He 's got a billy goat 's patch of hair on his chin and neck .
Several teeth are missing from the left side of his mouth , the result of a dental bridge that did n't fit and an extreme fear of dentists that followed .
Crumb says he 's still close to his brother Robert , who in 1992 moved to the south of France with his wife , Aline , and daughter , Sophie .
The older Crumb , who captured the hippie zeitgeist with his trippy , LSD - inspired Zap Comix in the mid-'60s , stills visits California occasionally and stays in contact with his brother .
But Maxon , who has a fear of flying , has never been to France .
" I have a very strong affection for Robert , " he says .
A strong rivalry persists , but during the '70s and ' 80s , when Robert still lived in California , " he was the only person in my life that I was still in contact with .
Separation from him kind of gives me some disconcert on that point . "
Most of Crumb 's family is gone :
His father , Charles Sr. , a former Marine who beat and emotionally terrorized his sons , died in 1982 .
His mother , Beatrice , who in " Crumb " is seen living a hermit 's existence with her son Charles , died in 1997 .
Younger sister Sandra , who declined to be interviewed for " Crumb , " died of liver cancer in 1998 .
The most tragic of all , Charles Jr. , never moved out of his parents ' home .
Unemployed , haunted by " homosexual pedophiliac tendencies " -- his own words -- Charles ended decades of depression when he killed himself in 1992 .
Robert , Maxon and their older sister , Carol , survive .
The family 's dysfunction , illustrated so heartbreakingly in " Crumb , " continues to shape Maxon 's life .
In his introduction to the 1995 collection , " Crumb Family Comics , " he wrote , " I have to continue indefinitely as a socially misfitted , god-mad , brooding ascetic and celibate , starving and street begging , eating a cloth string for meat and sitting on a bed of nails . "
When I read that quote back to him , he says the description still fits , except for the street begging .
His childhood wounded him , but it gave him a sensitivity and a way of seeing -- a spot of genius -- that he would n't otherwise have .

インターネットの進化を振り返ると、その発展の過程はニューヨークのマンハッタン島の歴史とよく似ている。どちらも最初に住所システムが作られた。片や碁盤目状のストリート（東西方向）とアベニュー（南北方向）、片や8ビットの数字で表されるツリー構造のIPネットとサブネットだ。この2つの体系的な住所システムは、どちらも後に、名前による場所の表記が組み合わされた。前者では地下鉄の駅名、後者ではDNSディレクトリだ。
だが現状では、この豊かで多様などちらの空間でも、そこに詳しい人以外が一般に目にするものは、そのリソースのごく一部に限られてしまっている。よそからニューヨークを訪れる人は観光ガイドに相談するし、一般のインターネットユーザーは、Googleが検索結果の最初のページに表示するものしか見ないからだ（4月26日の記事参照）。どちらの場合も、見えない力が選択肢を狭め、ほとんどのユーザーは排除された選択肢の存在を知るよしもなく、ましてやそれらの選択肢を実際に利用することはない。
人々は実世界では、サイバースペースで偏ったアドバイスを受ける場合と比べて、他人の利害に影響されることにずっと敏感だ。あなたはタクシードライバーから特定のレストランを熱心に勧められたら、そのドライバーはそこに顧客を連れて行くことで、紹介料を受け取っているのではないかと疑うだろう。
検索エンジンが行う処理は、一見合理的なものに思えるが、Googleのページランクアルゴリズムのようなものに基づいて操作が加えられており、検索エンジン企業、そしてほかの誰かの利益になるバイアスがかかりがちだ。だが、そのバイアスの性質やメカニズムは、ほとんどのユーザーにはまるで見えない。
「 search engine optimization （検索エンジン最適化）」という言葉でググると、6500万件近くヒットする。これらのヒットしたサイトでは、インターネットの機能のルールを故意に悪用してユーザーを狙った場所に誘導することの理論的な可能性や、そのことへの倫理的な反発が語られているわけではない。それを効果的に実行する方法と手段が語られているのである。
私はGoogleのボイコットを勧めているわけではない。まったく逆だ。例えば以前、地元の交響楽団の幹部会でPRの方法についてのブレーンストーミングをしたとき、私はポスターや広告に交響楽団の面倒なURLを載せるのはやめて、代わりに「
『Beach Cities Symphony』とググってください！」とメッセージを掲載することを提案した。その方が覚えやすいし、交響楽団がアピールしたい層にとって分かりやすいからだ。

Magic water harvesting machine
Sher : secret science Sher : secret science
Amazing .
A gizmo which sucks the air in , then sucks the water out of the air , and then spews out clean fresh water .
500 Gallons of it a day .
Every off - grid home should have one .
Only problem is it ’ll set you back a cool $ 500,000 .
FEMA have already bought two , and the US Army is said to be on the verge of buying many , because getting our boys pure water is one of the key logistics requirements of any operational planning .
The box o’ tricks is from Aqua Sciences Inc , and the company says the high cost is justified because in the end it “ only costs you $ 0.25 per gallon .
For those of us without an entire battalion at our command , however the price is still a little steep .
The makers are working on a consumer model , but it wo n’t be out any time soon .
Its precise workings are n’t public , but they use a chemical process similar to the one that causes salt to absorb moisture from the air ( and clump up your saltshaker ) .
The water - harvesting technology was originally the brainchild of the Pentagon ’s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ( DARPA ) , which sought ways to ensure sustainable water supplies for U.S. combat troops deployed in arid regions like Iraq .
Darpa gave millions to research companies like LexCarb and Sciperio to create a contraption that could capture water in the Mesopotamian desert .
But it was Aqua Sciences , that was first to put a product on the market that can operate in harsh climates .
“ People have been trying to figure out how to do this for years , and we just came out of left field in response to Darpa , ” said Abe Sher , chief executive officer of Aqua Sciences .
“ The atmosphere is a river full of water , even in the desert .
It wo n’t work absolutely everywhere , but it works virtually everywhere . ”
Sher said he is “ not at liberty ” to disclose details of the government contracts , except that Aqua Sciences won two highly competitive bids with “ some very sophisticated companies . ”
He also declined to comment on how the technology actually works .
“ This is our secret sauce , ” Sher said .
“ Like Kentucky Fried Chicken , it tastes good , but we wo n’t tell you what ’s in it . ”
“ We figured out how to tap it in a very unique and proprietary way , ” Sher said .
“ We figured out how to mimic nature , using natural salt to extract water and act as a natural decontamination .
“ Think of the Dead Sea , where nothing grows around it because the salt dehydrates everything .
It ’s kind of like that . ”
The 20 - foot machine can churn out 600 gallons of water a day without using or producing toxic materials and byproducts .
Jason Rowe , chief of staff to Rep. Tom Feeney , Florida Republican , called the technology “ pretty impressive . ”
“ I was pretty blown away by the things it ’s able to do , ” Rowe said .
“ The fact that this technology is not tied to humidity like others are makes it an attractive alternative for military bases in the Mideast where humidity is not really an option .
“ It seems like it ’s a cheaper alternative to trucking in bottled water , which has a shelf life , ” said Rowe , who described himself as a fiscal hawk .
Once deployed , the machines could reduce the cost of logistical support for supplying water to the troops in Iraq by billions of dollars , said Stuart Roy , spokesman of the DCI Group , Aqua Sciences ’ public affairs firm .
The cost to transport water by C - 17 cargo planes , then truck it to the troops , runs $ 30 a gallon .
The cost , including the machines from Aqua Sciences , will be reduced to 30 cents a gallon , Roy said .
Several systems on the market can create water through condensation , but the process requires a high level of humidity .
Aqua Sciences ’ machines only require 14 percent humidity , Roy said .
“ That ’s why this technology is superior and why they are getting the contracts . ”
Here ’s the spec :
Fully - contained mobile freshwater generation system for large - scale production , including power generator
Self - powered by diesel generator ( 7 - day supply ) , or by grid electricity
Easy to install , use and maintain
Container models can produce up to 1,200 gallons of water per day for 7 days without outside electrical source or refueling .
The 40 foot container with the reverse osmosis module can provide emergency water for up to 3,000 people per day .
20 FOOT EMERGENCY WATER STATION
Rated Water Production : Up to 500 gallons / day ( depending on conditions )
Dimensions : Modified 20 ′ container : 20 ′ long x 7.7 ′ wide x 7.8 ′ high
Water Containers : Individual water containers for emergency distribution included
40 FOOT EMERGENCY WATER STATION
Rated Water Production : Up to 1,200 gallons / day ( depending on conditions )
Integrated R.O. Module : Included reverse osmosis module can provide up to an additional 8,000 gallons / day from an existing source dependent upon conditions .
Dimensions : Modified 40 ′ container : 40 ′ long x 7.7 ′ wide x 7.8 ′ high
Water Containers : Individual water containers for emergency distribution included
Modular design enhances reliability
Quick standard connection for external storage tank
Can be powered by electricity or generator
Portable or can be affixed to structure
Easy to install , use , maintain and move
Deliverable by truck to isolated areas

The debate about adding closures to Java has spawned a curious debate about the role of explicit loops , recursion and higher - order list combinators .
I wonder why no one has stepped up in defense of GOTO yet .
Misguided Java snob Elliot Harold harangues fist and teeth against progress in computer languages :
I do n’t know what it is some people have against for loops that they ’re so eager to get rid of them .
This is n’t the first or even the second time CS theorists have revolted against for loops ( or equivalent ) .
This is n’t even the most proeminent below - the - belt jab at new expressive techniques .
Take this cheap shot at Haskell by Python ’s dictador buenito Guido van Rossum * :
It is a strongly typed pure functional language , where just about everything is written as recursive functions , because the language has no looping construct .
Because of this it will probably always remain a language of mostly academic interest : loops may be theoretically inferior to recursion , but I have no doubt that the human brain has special reasoning abilities for loops , and many real - world problems are most naturally expressed using loops rather than recursion .
Being the nice guys on the block , the Haskeller response is oh , but wait , the traditional Bird - Merteens / Standard Prelude functions are kinda expressive too , you know .
Which is fine and quite useful for bystanders trying to evaluate this debate on merit alone .
I myself should repackage the section in this endless meandering rambling on program transformations ; I still believe that the moment the masses figure out about map fusion , their brains are going to spontaneously explode , hurting and maybe killing thousands of others with skull bone pieces .
What I intend to submit here , though , is that this is n’t a technical debate : the “ they will have to forcefully extract my for loops from my cold , dead hands ” contingent is probably moved by three main nontechnical motivations :
Bone - headed resistance to change : this may come out as shocking to the likely audience of this blog , but .. many ( probably most ) people hate learning new stuff .
The writing ’s on the wall : monads in VB.net , closures and type - classes in Java , a ML in Microsoft ’s .
NET , etc seem all to point towards increasing importance of functional programming techniques in this “ real world ” the loop apologists seem to enjoy talking about , and when the levee breaks , the ordinary programmers they stand for —
I want to believe Guido understands the basic FP CS101 students understand — will have to learn something new .
Vested interest in current technologies ; for example , this Elliote Harold bloke who seems to have kickstarted the debate in the blogs , has written dozens of books on current dominant technologies ; he ’d sure like to be able to milk that cow for a while .
Vested interests in making simple software complex ; there is , after all , an entire industry built on maintaining 10 k - lines code that sums a few numbers and prints out the result .
Note that I ’m not saying there ’s a vast conspiracy ; Microsoft , Sun , etc. are out there to sell whatever people are buying , and if people are buying new programming paradigms , more power for them .
But how many consultancy models would go bust if Haskell - style functional programming was to rise to mainstream ?
I ’m pretty sure map fusion alone would bust one fourth of the current “ refactoring ” pundit market .
Maybe I ’m coming across as cynical , but it ’s just a little economist - think at work .
Functional programming is not crackpot science that would make people this passionate to fight out against .
If functional programming was an academic wonder with no place in the real world of software engineering — like countless other academic wonders out there trying to make a break into actual practice — would it attract this kind of slander ?
*( Guido is in fact trying to sell the idea that functional program is merely a matter of occasional syntactic convenience ; about this particular [ blatant lie | stupid , stupid slip ] , I fully , heartily endorse Xah Lee ‘s harsh words , rude expletives and all ) .
I 'm not entirely sure what I am basing this theory on but I believe that favouring composition over inheritance is when a programmer / developer is maturing into a better programmer who creates code that is easier to maintain and extend , along with solving the problem you are writing the code for the two main goals of my coding .
I wrote an article about why you should use Composition instead of inheritance and as always the comments for this post were very interesting .
It 's just a personal opinion of course but initially I use to think first of using inheritance because it seems easy and you can use code in the base class in all the classes that inherit this class .
I think this is why people favour inheritance .
I think the next step of evolution as a programmer is using interfaces as a way to protect against change in the future .
The next stage that perhaps I am at ( what I like to think , my work colleagues may disagree ) is that you start to use composition .
I have stopped thinking that the best code is the least amount of code written , which was one of the reason I use to use inheritance .
I now think of good code as code that has loose coupling and that does one thing i.e has high cohesion .
This type of code can easily be reused and change in any part of the code will hopefully affect a small part of the code base .
Code should be DRY and many other things but I am not talking about that kind of code intricacies but sort of looking at the code at a more holistic view .
I believe that favouring composition is way to achieve the code above .
I would like to get it clear that I am not against using inheritance and there is a time and place for using it when it 's the best option etc .
What I am trying to say is that there was a stage where I would try to use inheritance a lot but then over time I have stopped doing this and the reason for this is because I think my coding has matured and the goals of code I am trying to create have changed .
I 'm not really sure when the change of thought process occurred but I will now spend a bit more time creating code like the above to try and manage the complexity of the code and the effect of change on the code .
Of course this can also be abused with the creation of a million to many classes , as with everything there is a balance to achieved but more classes maybe better than too few because at least change is more likely to be isolated then .
I would like to know what other people think about this and what 's the next stage of development of a programmer

Police are accused of brutally mistreating Genoa protesters
Two Molotov cocktails allegedly planted by police in a school used as a base by anti-globalisation protesters can no longer be found .
The bombs are seen as crucial physical evidence against many of the defendants in the high - profile trial .
The police are accused of brutality and perjury over a raid on the Diaz school .
The petrol bombs - expected to be a key piece of evidence in the case - were due to be presented in court this week .
Prosecutors now fear that the case could collapse , allowing many of the high - ranking defendants to walk free .
Case at risk
The apparent disappearance of important evidence sparked strong reactions within Italy .
I 'm a bit shocked and numb at the state of the Italian judiciary
Mark Covell
British journalist injured in Genoa
' I still have nightmares '
The Reform Communist party - part of Prime Minister Romano Prodi's centre - left coalition government - has asked for a parliamentary investigation .
Mark Covell , a British journalist who suffered serious injuries in the Diaz raid , told the BBC News website the disappearance could endanger the whole trial .
" They have spent 20 million euros ( £ 13 m ) on this and if these Molotov cocktails are n't found it could all be for nothing , " he said .
" I'm a bit shocked and numb at the state of the Italian judiciary .
" But we can't calculate the full impact of this yet .
We will have to wait and see . "
Police hopeful
One police officer , Francesco Borre , told Italy 's La Repubblica newspaper that police routinely kept records of what they received and handed over .
There were riots by violent protesters before the Diaz raid
The secretary general of the Italian police union , Claudio Giardullo , held out hope that the trial could continue .
" Because the Molotov cocktails were actually photographed before they disappeared , the material need to have the bottles has been lessened , " he told the BBC .
" It is up to the magistrate to decide whether the evidence is fundamental to the trial .
" Police will hold an investigation about this - it is in their own interest , " he added .
Political priority
The trial centres on a raid carried out on the night of 21 July 2001 .
Nearly 300 officers , most dressed in full riot gear , forced their way into the Diaz school , which was being used as a base by anti-globalisation protesters .
Dozens of people were injured in the raid , as police also smashed windows and destroyed computers .
The two Molotov cocktails found inside the school were originally cited as evidence that the protesters were planning violence .
But reports soon emerged that the bombs were planted in the school by police themselves .
Prime Minister Prodi has made the swift conclusion of the trial a priority , and has promised to investigate the conduct of the police .
Wow .
Just when you think Republicans can't get any crazier , we find out that the powerful chairman of the Texas House Appropriations Committee , Warren Chisum , does n't even believe that the earth revolves around the sun .
Still , it 's enough to set the world a -spinning that the chairman of the House Appropriations Committee , the most powerful committee in the House , distributed to legislators a memo pitching crazed wingers who believe the earth stands still -- does n't spin on its axis or revolve around the Sun -- that Copernicus was part of a Jewish conspiracy to undermine the Old Testament .
Head on over to FixedEarth.com , and you 'd swear this was a parody site .
Levitating Globe " An electromagnet and computerized sensor hidden in its display stand cause the Earth to levitate motionlessly in the air . "
Could God have engineered something like that for the real Earth ?
The Bible and all real evidence confirms that this is precisely what He did , and indeed : The Earth is not rotating ... nor is it going around the sun .
The universe is not one ten trillionth the size we are told .
Today ’s cosmology fulfills an anti-Bible religious plan disguised as " science " .
The whole scheme from Copernicanism to Big Bangism is a factless lie .
Those lies have planted the Truth - killing virus of evolutionism in every aspect of man ’s " knowledge " about the Universe , the Earth , and Himself .
Take your time .
Check it all out .
Decide for yourself .
Hooookaay .
Warren Chisum does n't just believe this crap , but is evangelizing it .
He may very well be the craziest winger in all of elected politics .
I bet even Roy Moore believes that the earth revolves around the sun .
And this guy chairs one of the most powerful committees in the Texas legislature .
Update :
As shared by many in the comments , I really , really miss Molly Ivins today .
The Language of Eve
Geoffrey Nunberg
" Fresh Air " commentary ,
January 3 , 2007
In 1569 , an Antwerp physician and naturalist named Johannes Goropius Becanus published a book arguing that the language spoken in the Garden of Eden must have been Flemish -- or more specifically , the Flemish of Antwerp -- and that all other languages could be derived from that tongue .
According to Becanus , for example , the name Eve came from the Flemish words eu-vat -- " people barrel " or " barrel of generations " -- since all of humanity had its origin in Eve 's womb .
Not surprisingly , Becanus 's theories were congenial to many of his countrymen , though others found them loopy -- Ben Jonson ridiculed him in his play The Alchemist and the philosopher Leibniz turned his name into a verb that means " to speculate foolishly about language . "
But Becanus 's spiritual descendants have flourished over the centuries .
Scarcely a day goes by that the group of linguists I post with at the LanguageLog blog are n't debunking some claim about language that 's no less absurd than Becanus 's were .
So we decided to create the annual Johannes Goropius Becanus award , or Becky for short , awarded to the promulgater of the single most ridiculous or misleading bit of linguistic nonsense that somebody manages to put over in the media .
The year 2006 was rich in contenders .
Start with a character named Paul J. J. Payack , who announced last May that using a secret algorithm , he had determined that the English language contained exactly 986,120 words and that it would pass the million mark in the fall .
It was a perfect example of what I think of as cow - pie linguistics , but the claim was duly reported by sources like the New York Times , Reuters , and NPR .
Then there was the publicist for the British dairy industry who managed to get the BBC to run a story in August that reported with all seriousness that cows from the English West Country moo with a distinct regional accent .
If you believe that , I 've got a English bulldog who drops his h's I want to sell you .
And just last month , the BBC reported that research had shown that British teenagers had become so inarticulate that nearly a third of their speech consists of just 20 simple words like yeah and no .
Actually , that figure is probably about right , but It sounds a lot less alarming when you realize the 20 most frequent English words account for around a third of everybody 's speech , whether you 're listening to William Safire , Susan Sontag , or the BBC 's own news reports .
But by a unanimous vote , this year 's Becky goes to the psychiatrist Louann Brizendine , whose bestselling book The Female Brain argues that most of the cognitive and social differences between the sexes are due to differences in brain structure .
It 's a controversial thesis .
The New York Times 's David Brooks and others have hailed the book as a challenge to feminist dogma , and Brizendine herself has charged that her critics are angry because her conclusions are n't politically correct .
Actually , though , you can leave out the " politically " part .
The reviewers for the British science journal Nature described the book as " riddled with scientific errors . "
And in newspaper commentaries and posts on the LanguageLog blog , the University of Pennsylvania linguist Mark Liberman has been meticulously debunking Brizendine 's claims about men's and women 's language .
For example , Brizendine asserts that differences between men's and women 's brains make women more talkative than men , and goes on to say that women on average use 20,000 words a day while men use only 7000 .
That factoid conforms so neatly with gender stereotypes about chatty women and taciturn men that a lot of people were indignant that anybody would spend money to discover anything so obvious .
One reporter at a San Francisco TV station began his story on Brizendine by saying " Here 's a news flash .
Women talk more than men .
Duh . "
Except that , duh ! , it is n't true .
It turns out that the figures Brizendine reported had been taken from a book by a self - help guru who had simply pulled them out of the air .
And the studies that have been done generally show either that men talk slightly more than women or that the two sexes talk about the same amount .
Or take Brizendine 's claim that women on average speak twice as fast as men do .
That 's another cherished bit of gender lore , but no research shows anything of the sort -- the best evidence indicates that men on average speak a bit faster than women do .
Nor is there any scientific basis for her claims that men think about sex every 53 seconds while women think about sex only once a day , or that women are more emotionally attentive because their more sensitive hearing enables them to hear subtle tones and nuances in speech that escape men .
In short , saying that Brizendine 's claims about sex differences in language are not exactly scientific gives " not exactly " a bad name .
Yet the media generally covered the book uncritically , without running the claims past linguists or neuroscientists , or apparently , past their own science writers , either .
In fact the book got much more media attention than any of the serious recent research on the biology of sex differences .
That work suggests a more complex picture of the relation between nature and nurture .
But in the lifestyle sections where these language items inevitably end up , the preference is for simple stories laced with plausible - sounding nuggets that confirm what we think we already know -- that English is the biggest language , that teenagers are inarticulate .
Or in this case , that women are congenital chatteboxes .
Four hundred and fifty years after Goropius Becanus , we 're still easy marks for engaging fables about where Eve 's language came from .
Corporate R&D March 15 , 2007
Posted by gordonwatts in science
The March 3rd edition of the Economist had a good article on the state of corporate R&D .
You know — the people the brought us the transistor ?
This survey points out how the boom of technology has really changed how research is done .
In the old days places like AT&T had Bell laboratories — places where research was done that did n’t focus on an immediate product .
Sure — the research was more applied than what goes on in some university lab where there is absolutely no pressure to produce a product — but still the product horizon was pretty far off .
No so much any longer , however .
According to this survey research departments in companies ( if they still have them ) are much more focused on solving the problems of product teams — indeed , research groups are often paired with product teams which was rarely the case previously .
It was a science advisor for Franklin Roosevelt that setup this system : universities would do only pure research and companies would do applied .
This model with separation of scientists and engineers was duplicated in companies .
Obviously , it worked quite well .
But it has changed .
The Economist ’s argument for this change ( now ) ?
The approach to R&D is changing because long - term research was a luxury only a monopoly could afford . …
“ The fusion of research and development is meant to solve the central shortcoming of [ Roosevelt ’s science advisor ’s ] plan : how to turn ideas into commercial innovations .
… … the nature of IT has changed so much .
… the science that went into computing was itself closer to basic research .
By contrast , many of the big scientific questions in computing have been answered — at least well enough for companies to find that innovation emerges from new ways of arranging today ’s technologies rather than inventing new ones .
What is the new model ?
Companies tinker with today ’s products rather than pay researchers to think big thoughts .
More often than not , firms hungry for innovation look to mergers and acquisitions with their peers , partnerships with universities and takeovers of venture - capital - backed start - ups .
There is ( at least one ) one ironic passage in the article :
But making this vision work technically is hard .
Academics , he says , cannot do this , since they continually struggle for funds .
This forces them into projects of just one or two years — even shorter than industry horizons .
“ It ’s insane , ” says Mr. Drucker [ a Microsoft media applications researcher ] .
He reckons it means corporate research can look farther ahead , do bigger things and risk more money for a big payout .
You ca n’t have it both ways , right ?
You ca n’t depend on universities for start ups and long term research and also talk about really short event horizons .
Sadly , there is truth to this split .
Perhaps they are right .
All the important big questions that require years of work have been answered in computing ( where have we heard that before ! ? ) , and it is fitting that companies , most motivated to put out a working product , are the right place for further research .
But this product driven model wo n’t work for the next big thing .
If transistors powered this revolution — what will power the next ?
You ’ll need something hidden away , insulated from the corporate winds , to do that research .
Currently only the government has a “ business model ” that can fund that sort of research .
Now , if only they had enough cash to carry out that mission …

But now the point : I shave after I get out of the shower .
I throw a towel around my waist , but other than that I shave naked .
Like I said my kitten - let 's call him Butters - is hanging out in the bathroom the whole time .
At this point he 's maybe 4 months old , still young , but full of energy .
He 's playing , doing his thing , and eventually he starts rolling and playing around my feet .
' How sweet , ' I think .
' This is a great cat .
' Next thing I know i'm on the floor , curled in the foetus position with blood dripping down my chin from a razor cut and Butters is hiding out behind the porcelin throne , starring at me with huge , dialated eyes .
yeah , he went there .
Dangling objects + kitten = kill .
For those who still have n't caught on , while playing around my feet Butters must have looked up and seen the ole ' twig and berries , and decide that it would be a great idea to give the danglies a swat .
He had good aim - very good aim ... I do n't understand masochists .

Thus far , I ’ve been riding the fence on the " cut the funding " debate .
But no more .
Not after listening to that moron , our President , on TV this morning .
After listening to him bumble his way through another public appearance , I ’m convinced that , whatever the cost politically , the Democrats must now move to cut funding for the war in Iraq .
As a soldier who ’s served in both theaters of this war , I ’m often asked whether I think a freeze on war funding would hurt the soldiers .
I usually respond rationally by saying something like , " No , but it could hurt them in the long term if such a move were to cost the Democrats the elections in 2008 . "
Well , I do n’t think this is the time for long - term planning anymore .
I ’ve played the pros and cons of cutting funding over and over in my head for months , and I am now convinced that a cessation of funding is the only way to stop this lunatic .
Cutting funding will not endanger the troops .
Here ’s why :
These are some of the arguments used against the idea of cutting funding :
It hurts Democrats politically
It might .
But I ’m not really concerned with that at this point .
Call me short - sighted , but all I have to do is take one look at George W. Bush muddling his way through a question and answer session and I am convinced that the American people will be with me on this .
Note to policymakers reading this :
Please take a gander at the latest poll numbers .
It endangers the troops
This is propaganda nonsense .
The House of Representatives could easily fashion a bill that halts any funding for the war on March 1 , 2008 .
Such a bill would fully fund the troops in harm ’s way for the rest of the year — but it would force the President to begin the redeployment immediately .
How we , as Americans , have gotten it into our collective consciousnesses that cutting the funding could somehow " hurt the troops " is something I ’ll never be able to figure out .
The Pentagon has some evil people that work within its halls , but the organization itself is not inherently evil .
If the funding were cut , the Defense Department would very quickly move to begin a safe and orderly withdrawal .
I think back to when I was in Iraq and I wanted to come home .
Never once did it enter my mind that if the funding were cut , I would somehow be in more danger .
I mean , I was already there with soft - skinned humvees and only a single plate for my vest .
It hurts the troops ’ morale
Go talk to a 22 - year old father who ’s been there for 13 months and who ’s never seen his baby .
Ask him how ending the war would affect his morale .
Better yet , go ask him right after he ’s survived his third IED and follow - on ambush .
Ask him an hour after it happens , while he can barely hold his cigarette because he ’s still got the shakes from the fear and adrenaline .
" Hey , bub , how ’s your morale ? "
It emboldens terrorists
Embassy bombings .
U.S.S. Cole. 9/11 . World Trade Center tumbling down on TV .
Who the fuck came up with this talking point ?
In case you missed it , the " terrorists " were pretty riled up before the invasion of Iraq .
And another thing I hate about this meme is that it is stated from a position of fear — the implication being that we will be in more danger if we leave .
Sigh .
So you ’re telling me that if we pull out of Iraq , rebuild our military to its former strength , and re-focus on Afghanistan and Pakistan , we would be emboldening the terrorists ?
I gotta tell you , if I were a terrorist , the thing I ’d be most afraid of would be a fresh , rested , rebuilt , and focused American military .
If I ’m a terrorist , I ’m currently loving the fact that a beaten down and confused American Army is sitting at a standstill , stuck in the February mud of Iraq .
It makes my life easier .
It will cause Iraq to fall into a bloody civil war in which regional players will involve themselves
Have I been sleeping ?
Were we not at that point already ?
How do these assholes on the right get away with continuing to say that on one hand , if we leave , it could cause other countries to step in , and on the other hand , to say that these other countries are already meddling in Iraq ’s business ?
Did n’t we just get a Powerpoint on that ?
Bottom line :
Cut the funding .
Pull the plug .
Take away the keys .
However you want to phrase it , it needs to be done soon .
The book I was working on for most of 2006 is now finally showing up in bookstores so it 's time to announce it here .
Linux Kernel in a Nutshell is now availble online , for free , from the kernel.org world - wide mirror systems ( so that I really have no idea how many people download it , and that 's fine with me . )
To quote the book 's official site :
If you want to know how to build , configure , and install a custom Linux kernel on your machine , buy this book .
It is written by someone who spends every day building , configuring , and installing custom kernels as part of the development process of this fun , collaborative project called Linux .
I 'm especially proud of the chapter on how to figure out how to configure a custom kernel based on the hardware running on your machine .
This is an essential task for anyone wanting to wring out the best possible speed and control of your hardware .
Not satisified with just offering up electonic PDF versions that mirror the book as it was exactly printed , I have availble the DocBook source that is heavily marked up by some tools that was used to generate the PDF files from .
Also , as a first in the history of publishing books ( that I know of ) , the entire revision history of the book is availble as a git archive so you can see how slowly the process went , how bad my writing really is before the excellent editors at O'Reilly get ahold of it , and how much the Technical Reviewers for the book really helped me out in making this something that everyone will want to have on their bookshelf .
It weighs in at a slim 175 pages , which is amazing as both the editor and myself thought it would be about 350 pages before the layout people attacked it with a bunch of small pointy fonts , saving a few forests in their glee to pack as much information as possible on every printed page .
And yes , to answer all of the questions that people have asked when reading the introduction , the book did start out at over 1,000 pages , consisting of nothing other than a description of every kernel configuration option possible ( see the git tree if you do n't believe me ) .
Luckily , cooler heads prevailed , and a whole bunch of useful content was written by me to make this something that would acually sell .
What are you waiting for ?
Go buy a copy or if you are cheap , just download the thing and start building kernels !
What next ?
No more books for a while , that 's for sure .
But before quiting the writing gig , I was lucky to write a chapter for a special compilation project from O'Reilly that has turned into an amazing book that I feel honored to have been able to contribute to .
More on that in a few months when it gets closer to publication date .

In the beetle Onthophagus nigriventris researchers have found a trade - off between testicle and horn size ( Image : O Helmy and D Emlen ) Onthophagus lanista is another species of dung - beetle endowed with impressive head gear ( Image : E Greene )
Dung beetle research may be about to boost the cliché about men with flashy sports cars .
According to new study , male beetles with the most dramatic and ostentatious sets of horns apparently pay for that with smaller testicles .
Advertisement
The research is one of the first studies to experimentally demonstrate that investing energy in one mating advantage may come at the expense of another .
Male dung beetles of the genus Onthophagus are noted for the size and diversity of their horns .
In some species , these make up 40 % of males ’ body length .
These iridescent beetles use their flashy ornaments to battle against one another and block access to tunnels where they mate with females .
The competition does not end there , however , as females often mate with more than one male .
In these species , once inside the female , one male ’s sperm must compete with other males ’ sperm to fertilise eggs .
It is generally thought that the males that produce the most sperm are more likely to achieve a fertilisation so , besides the horns , testicle capacity is important in competition between males too , says Douglas Emlen , study co-author at the University of Montana in Missoula , US .
Stunted development
The problem is that in developing organisms there are limited resources available .
Previous work has shown that horn size is negatively correlated to other traits such as eye , wing and antennae size .
To test the tussle that goes on between different sex- related structures , Emlen and colleague Leigh Simmons at the University of Western Australia in Crawley , experimentally stunted the development of horns in a brood of larvae of the species Onthophagus nigriventris .
They did this by cauterising areas of cells on the surface of larvae that would otherwise have developed into horns .
The pair found that in comparison to a control brood of males which were allowed to develop normally , hornless males grew into larger adults with disproportionately large testes .
In general , the pair found an inverse relationship between horn and testes size .
Energetic constraints
“ This study is the first solid experimental demonstration that adaptations to compete for mates trade - off with what it takes to compete for fertilisations , ” says Scott Pitnick at Syracuse University in New York , US , who was not involved in the study .
“ Because of energetic constraints , you really ca n’t be good at all things , ” says Pitnick , who last year revealed a trade - off between relative brain and testes sizes in 300 different species of bat .
In a follow - up analysis , the researchers looked at 25 species of Onthophagus beetles .
Between these other species , the researchers did not find an inverse relationship between horn and testicle size .
They suggest that those species with the most dramatic horns were those that had developed an evolutionary strategy to buffer or protect the development of their testes .
The study also showed that in species where females mate with the most males – where sperm competition is at its fiercest – horns tend not to develop on the thorax .
The thorax is closer to the testicles than the head , so a thorax horn might be more likely to divert precious resources from the testes during development , the researchers suggest .
“ Trade - offs are fundamental to biology but they continue to surprise us , both in the forms they take , and in the myriad ways they can shape the evolution of organisms , ” says Emlen .

We ’ve received several questions asking how to block specific sites from being accessed directly on the Mac .
The frustration seems to lie in how easy it is to circumvent the typical measures , such as setting Parental Controls and blocking sites in Safari , only to have them accessed in Camino or Firefox .
Well , a quick and efficient way to block access to specified sites is by editing the /etc / hosts file , which has the added bonus of providing system wide results .
Whether it ’s children or your roommate who you ’re trying to stop from visiting a particular website , here ’s how to do it .
Block Access to Websites on a Mac
Editing /etc/hosts
1 ) To edit the hosts file and add a new entry , open up your Terminal and type the following ( You ’ll be asked for your root password because this is a system file ) :
sudo nano
/etc/hosts
2 ) This will bring up a screen that looks a lot like the one below , notice that yahoo.com has been added at the bottom as a site we want to block .
To block any other site , simply type it in the same fashion .
You can use the loopback IP of localhost and have as many sites map to 127.0.0.1 as you want , or specify other IP ’s to redirect a URL to , like 0.0.0.0 :
Blocking websites in ETC HOSTS File of a Mac
3 ) Now save the file in nano by hitting control -o and the return key .
Note that you may need to run the following command for changes to take effect :
sudo dscacheutil - flushcache
This flushes your DNS cache .
How this works : you are now telling your Mac to send requests for MySpace.com ( or whatever site you listed ) to 127.0.0.1 , your local machine .
This completely blocks the MySpace.com address from being loaded in any web browser .
( Note that if someone is savvy enough though they could access the blocked site through a web proxy ) .
If you really want to be crafty and have Personal Web Sharing enabled , you could put up a simple webpage for people to see when they try to access the blocked sites .

Today , an acquaintance ( I ’ll call her “ Laura ” ) asked me if I would buy some Girl Scout cookies from her daughter ’s troop .
I told her “ No thank you . ”
It ’s not that I do n’t enjoy eating Girl Scout cookies ( I do enjoy Thin Mints and Peanut Butter Sandwich Cookies ) .
It ’s not that I generally oppose the activities of Girl Scouts .
I approve of much of what Girl Scouts do .
Here ’s what triggered this post .
Laura told me that the average box of cookies sells for three dollars and that the average profit for each box of cookies is only fifty cents .
Hmmmm .
Therefore , I can support their Girl Scouts to the same extent by handing $ 5 directly to the local troop or by buying $ 30 worth of cookies .
Unless you think that eating cookies is an especially good thing , it makes much more sense to simply hand the local troop $ 5 .
Then again , eating cookies , especially a lot of cookies , is not a good thing .
Cookies consist largely of refined carbohydrates and sugars .
These are exactly the kinds of ingredients that invite obesity .
Are the Girl Scouts concerned about obesity ?
Very much so ( so am I ) , yet they continue to rely on cookie sales to fund their activities .
But let ’s go back to the money for a moment .
If you click here , you can see it stated that “ all of the revenue ” from cookie sales “ stays with the local Girl Scout council that sponsors the sale . ”
The official site carefully points out that individual troops receive “ from 12 - 17 % of the purchase price of each box sold . ”
There are various important numbers that the site does not provide , however .
For instance , is $.50 per box ( the amount indicated to me by my acquaintance ) the average amount of proceeds per box sold ( as Laura indicated ) ?
If so , the 12 - 17 % of the purchase price of each box sold amounts to $ .45 per box , which means that most of the proceeds go to the local troop .
If true , it would be commendable .
But we do n’t know , because the Girl Scout organization does not specify how much profit is involved in the sale of each box of cookies .
All of this makes me wonder , because the Girl Scout organization is based in the middle of one of the highest rent districts in the world , 420 5th Ave in Manhattan .
That ’s where 400 employees work for the Girl Scout organization .
But nowhere on the site will you find anything about the sales information I just mentioned , or other things I wonder , such as the salaries and perks of these 400 employees .
Would n’t it be nice to know how much money it takes to run that fancy headquarters ?
How about a pie chart showing the sources of that money ?
Nowhere will you find the amount of that annual cookie profit money that flows back to the Girl Scout headquarters from determined efforts of little girls .
Would n’t that be interesting to know ?
I suspect that , indirectly , cookie money flows back to the Girl Scout headquarters at a brisk rate .
I ’d be interested in knowing for sure , though , especially since my client has told me that the local troops have to purchase their own badges and other supplies with their own money .
Much of what local Girl Scout troops do is not subsidized by cookie profits .
I do n’t know how much aggregate cookie profit is generated each year , because that is not on the website either .
Maybe those cookie - revenue numbers are just too big to fit on the official Girl Scout webpage !
I have occastionally supported local Girl Scouting activity , despite my concerns with the financially opaque corporate hierarchy .
I ’ve decided , though , that my solution will now be to offer a direct donation to the local troop , just as I mentioned at the top of this post .
Five dollars handed to a little girl who approaches you to sell cookies is the equivalent of buying $ 30 worth of cookies , and you can rest assured that all of that money will stay with the local troop .
If you really want to get good bang for the buck and you usually buy $ 30 for the cookies , just hand the full $ 30 to local troop –that ’s like buying $ 180 worth of cookies .
In the process , everyone will be healthier and the local troop will be flush with cash to spend on those badges and other supplies that the national organization refuses to buy for them .
The Girl Scout cookie phenomenon raises an interesting issue about the way Americans think of charities .
Why is it that people insist on getting something back for themselves in order to donate money to allegedly good causes ?
The Girl Scout cookie phenomenon is a classic case of this need for a quid pro quo .
If someone really believed in the Girl Scouts , they should n’t need to receive cookies in return for supporting the Girl Scouts .
Rather , they would just hand the local troop some money ( as I ’ve suggested above ) .
This problem ( the need for a quid pro quo when soliciting for charities ) , is not peculiar to Girl Scouts .
It ’s everywhere you look .
Almost every institutional charity offers stuff to people who donate .
Mugs , T - shirts , videos , CDs , plaques , special access to celebrities , umbrellas , admissions to amusements , paperweights , inscribed souvenirs , admission to concerts or other special events .
Sometimes an organization will invite you to turn down any sort of gift .
Kudos for those people who do so , those people who realize that demanding a gift in return for their contribution effectively reduces their contribution .
They realize that those mugs , T - shirts and cookies are not free .
And furthermore , who really needs more stuff of that sort ?
All of this makes me wonder what kind of people we ’ve become that so many of us insist on getting substantial amounts of stuff back in order to “ contribute ” to charities .
I would suspect we ’ve reached new levels of proficiency at being rampant consumers .
See here and here .
Admittedly , this need for a quid pro quo is nothing new .
After all , people were selling indulgences hundreds of years ago .
But now , it is also much more visible and so widely accepted .
It makes me frustrated enough to go eat half a box of Thin Mints .
If only I had bought those cookies . . .
Anil Dash and I have the same job title : evangelist .
I share Anil 's reservations about his job title , too :
You see , these days my business cards describe me as " Chief Evangelist " .
On the plus side , it 's the first time in the history of the company that I 've basically only had one job ( though I still help out with as much stuff as I can ) , but on the downside , the title is f**king ridiculous .
I hate the word " evangelist " as a description for people who advocate technology not merely because of its religious connotations , but also because it implies a degree of proselytization that I 'd like to think I do n't participate in .
Most of the time , my job is really just simple education .
However , unlike Anil , I believe the religious connotations of the evangelist title are perfectly suited to the field of software development .
Software development is a religion , and any programmer worth his or her salt is the scarred veteran of a thousand religious wars .
That does n't mean we need to be humorless jerks about it , of course .
But to completely disavow the connection between religion and software development is dishonest .
I say we embrace it .
We 're all disciples of the church of Von Neumann .
Praise the lord and pass the ones and zeroes !
The title is a little ridiculous .
My wife tells me that everyone laughs when she explains that her husband is a technical evangelist .
Am I offended ?
Heck no .
I think that 's great .
Laughing is the only sane , rational response to any kind of evangelism -- it means you have a sense of humor .
Entertainment is a crucial part of being an evangelist .
Without it , you 're a sanctimonious bore .
Good evangelism is always equal parts education and entertainment .
Edutainment , if you will .
Of course , you 'll only be effective as an evangelist if you can clearly communicate your ideas to other people .
This is a critical skill , whether you have any desire to be an " evangelist " or not .
As Joel Spolsky famously said :
The difference between a tolerable programmer and a great programmer is not how many programming languages they know , and it's not whether they prefer Python or Java .
It 's whether they can communicate their ideas .
It 's questionable how effective you can be by writing code alone .
You have to convince us how awesome your code is .
You have to make us believe in the glory of that code .
In short , you evangelize .
And that means constantly cultivating those essential communication skills .
With apologies to Jeff Foxworthy , if you frequently find yourself entertaining people to effectively communicate with them , you may be .. an Evangelist .
Take Marc Hedlund 's experiences , for example :
I was recently asked how I run our development team .
I said , " Well , basically I blog about something I think we should do , and if the blog post convinces the developers , they do it .
If not , I lobby for it , and if that fails too , the idea falls on the floor .
They need my approval to launch something , but that 's it .
That 's as much ' running things ' as I do , and most of the ideas come from other people at this point , not from me and my blog posts .
I 've argued against some of our most successful ideas , so it 's a good thing I do n't try to exert more control . "
I 'm exaggerating somewhat ; of course I have n't blogged about all of our ideas yet .
But I do think of myself as Lobbyist - in - Chief , and I have lots of good examples of cases where I failed to talk people into an idea and it did n't happen as a result .
One person I said this to asked , " So who holds the product vision , then ? " and I replied , " Well , I guess I do , " but really that 's not right .
We all do .
The product is the result of the ideas that together we 've agreed to pursue .
I recruit people based on their interest in and enthusiasm about the ideas behind Wesabe , and then set them loose , and we all talk and listen constantly .
That 's how it works -- and believe it or not , it does work .
Like Marc , you may already be an evangelist and not even know it .
And it really does work .
Evangelism is simply sharing your excitement and enthusiasm with other people in an effective way .
If that makes you more entertaining and a better communicator , well , those are side effects you can probably live with .
How I Write - Conversation Transcript Robert Sapolsky
Robert Sapolsky developed his writing skills doing field work in Africa .
He was lonely .
There was no radio or any other company , and “ as a result you wind up sending letters to every human that you have known in your life in hopes that they would write back to you . ”
Some would , he would write numerous letters , often saying the same things but each time getting more concise .
Today he likes to write with his laptop on the train commuting between San Francisco and Stanford – it ’s “ amazingly addictive ” – which limits his writing to two hours a day .
Sapolsky has to be careful : there ’s the writing for his research , serious writing about neurological issues , often based on his research with primates ; but then there ’s the writing he ’s gotten famous for , his essays in The New Yorker and other magazines and books on scientific issues written with broader audiences in mind .
He points out that those scientists who write too much for popular audiences become “ Saganized ” ( after Carl Sagan ) : they begin to loose credibility in the scientific community .
And yet he has been called one of the top science writers in the country .
In this talk , he reveals how he generates his ideas for articles – Who could imagine that People magazine could be such a vital tool ?
He discusses how he shapes his fascinations and anxieties into stories , how he talks it through with his wife and others , how he fashions books on a grander scale .
He takes his writing very seriously – but above all it is a pleasure , something that he enjoys doing , and he allows us to visit the source of that fun .
Transcript of How I Write Conversation with Robert Sapolsky
HO : Hi , I ’m Hilton Obenzinger .
I ’m Associate Director for Honors Writing at Undergraduate Research Programs , and I teach in the English Department .
I have been conducting — this is the end of the second year — of “ How I Write ” conversations .
The actual whole project is called “ How I Write : Varieties of Writing Experience . ”
If you know the book Varieties of Religious Experience by William James , it ’s that kind of investigation of all the different ways that people approach writing .
This obviously always involves content — what people write about — but one of the main issues , the concerns that we have is how people go about writing , the whole process of writing , and the work style , the work habits involved in writing .
Since starting , we have discovered a lot of different things .
Anyone that has been coming fairly regularly will note the main thing that we have discovered is that there is just wild variety and idiosyncrasies of people who are advanced writers .
I ’ll just give you a couple examples , and we find out things about people .
Eric Roberts , who is a computer scientist , refuses to have a computer at home , has a religious vow never to watch TV , actually reads books — what happened to our stereotypes about computer scientists ?
And Mary Lou Roberts , who was in our history department , would write eighty pages until she would figure out what she was writing about , and is very used to the fact that she would toss out eighty pages and start at that point .
It is hard to find a lot of other people who could bear the idea of throwing away eighty pages .
She would also write with light rock playing in the background , and she hates light rock .
And the reason is that because she hates light rock she does n’t have to concentrate but it creates that white noise .
And every half hour she would stop and play a computer game .
That ’s one .
Another kind of take on this : David Abernethy , who writing his last book that came out on the history of European colonialism all around the world , and from its very beginnings would take notes and then keep a log and have a kind of conversation with his notes .
The nature of political science and the way he worked , he did not want to publish anything until he knew his entire argument for everything .
Consequently , it took him fifteen years to write this book , and he got a reputation as being a lazy academic who got tenure and never wrote anything by the way that he worked , and he was working very hard , but only during the summers when he had the time .
He could n’t get any fellowships , any grants , because he did n’t have much of a CV because he was n’t publishing — the way the system works .
And he was very adamant in his style .
I said , you know , I can suggest to you ways of …
“ No , no , it ’s the way I work . ”
Now he ’s emeritus , so he ’s got time .
But that ’s just some of the examples .
Diane Middlebrook , who gets up in the morning , loves writing biography , drinks six cups of coffee , reads a nice essay that inspires her in terms of language , and sits down and does n’t get up until she ’s done working , like a real nine - to - five type operation .
When she gets stuck — gets blocked — she sits there until she ’s unstuck .
Other people go for walks ; she will just sit there for hours at a time , fighting herself .
So I can give you many , many examples .
So the main thing that we have learned is that people are very , very different in how they approach the whole process of writing — revisions , everything .
So , today we ’re going to speak with Robert Sapolsky , professor of neurology and neurological sciences , and one of the leading neuroscientists in the world , and a research associate with the institute of primate research museums in Kenya .
He has received a MacArthur fellowship and wonderful praise for the books that he ’s written — in addition to his regular scientific writing for the scientific community — for the broader intellectual community .
So , these books include Why Zebras Do n't Get Ulcers — and I told him I would n’t get ulcers because I would be the zebra that gets eaten by the lion —
The Trouble with Testosterone and Essays on Biology , and A Primate 's Memoir , a book I found that reminded me of the same pleasure I had reading Jules Vernes ’ Mysterious Island in eighth grade .
I was so drawn in by the book that it was just pure pleasure of trying to find out what was going to happen in the book .
And he ’s written in many magazines .
Later on this quarter we ’ll be hearing from George Fredrickson , one of the most esteemed American history professors , and Penelope Eckard , in linguistics and the director of feminist studies , so very different types of fields .
And this is co-sponsored by undergraduate research programs and Stanford Writing Center .
Now , welcome , and the way that I generally begin is that I have a conversation for part of the time , and then open it up to the floor to ask any kinds of questions of Professor Sapolsky about his writing , about writing , any concerns or issues about writing , anything that you want — and I suppose anything about primates as well , but really we ’re focusing on writing .
And the way that we generally begin is , I ’d like to ask you , first of all is there anything that you wanted to just raise yourself before I get going ?
RS : Well , let ’s see , this ranks as a fairly bizarre setting .
You know , I 'm basically a scientist ; I do n't really think of myself as a writer and it ’s something that I need to discipline myself to do less of , because it is much easier for me than doing the science a lot of the time , and just as much quickness .
“ Oh Christ , ” says half the English majors in here or something .
So , I definitely do n’t think of myself as a writer .
And just as a measure of that , I 've been here on campus for fifteen years and not only have I never set foot in the English department before , I could not have told you where it was .
So , I 'm not terribly in tune to this stuff , and it is also striking me as , like , I am really up a creek here on the next hour if I have to come up with a philosophy of how you do a rewrite here .
So I ’m a scientist who writes now and then .
So I start off with my , like , do n’t hurt me if I do n’t make sense .
HO : We do n’t , I mean , I do n't expect a philosophy of writing .
I mean , that would be incredible , but we already have an interesting dynamic : you actually enjoy writing .
RS : That ’s true .
HO : Where did that come from ?
I mean , did you begin writing for school – all of a sudden in third grade you got this delight ?
RS : Naaa… HO : OK , when did it happen ?
RS : I was OK with writing , and throughout college I did n't have a writer 's block .
So I had friends who would pull their hair out over it , and that was sort the central organizing emphasis of their life , and I never had a writer ’s block .
It was something that I was OK at , but nothing I took any great pleasure in .
I never took a literature class in college , or any English course or anything .
And I was not particularly into writing , and it was not until after I finished college — right after , a week after graduation — I went off to Africa for a year and a half to begin to get my field work started , which I have been doing ever since for twenty - five years and it was fairly isolated site , where a lot of the time I was by myself .
I would go 8 to 10 hours a day without speaking to anyone , I would get a mail drop about once every two weeks or so , there was no electricity , there was no radio , there was no anything , and I suddenly got unbelievably , frantically dependent on mail .
So as a result you wind up sending letters to every human that you have known in your life in hopes that they would write back to you .
So what would happen is , all I could afford at the time were like these one - page aerogram things that you could sort of get in these big stacks , and something vaguely interesting would happen every couple of days or so .
So you would write to somebody about it , and then you would write to the next person about it , and you would realize that before the end of the day , you had just written 25 versions of it , each of which was a page and a half long .
And I think somehow the process that year , sort of the writing just got very intertwined with sort of all of the more emotional issues , and there was definitely a shift there .
I mean , before that I was a very , sort of a very serious musician , and a year and a half out in the field completely wiped that out , and there was a transition during that time from music to writing .
HO : So it was in some ways an emotional protection racket .
I mean , you were able to keep yourself attached to the world that way .
RS : Yeah , with a weird sort of time delay .
Yeah , it did sort of …if you sent enough letters to people they would feel guilty and eventually write back to you .
That ’s what the weird thing is .
It ’s a whole Peace Corps dynamic .
HO : Well , it ’s interesting , though .
Because , you said , the same incident you would write it several different times .
It would n’t be identical ?
RS : No , I would get incredibly bored with the damn thing and would thus started editing and make it more concise , and all of that , and you could sort of see it shrinking until it was half an aerogram , and then I would have to come up with something else to say .
So I think just sort of in passing it kind of forced me to start editing .
HO : And so , yeah , you started editing and went through a process of revision actually forced by duplication …
RS : Yes .
HO : … rather than the need to get it right .
Just the need to do it again .
RS : And the need to get it shorter and get out of there .
HO : Yeah , when did this then , you know , kind of develop into an interest — and I want to talk about the difference between scientific writing and writing for the broader public — but , you know , how then did your writing develop ?
RS : Umm …I guess it remained very much an outgrowth of the field work stuff : you know , all throughout , sort of , from like the late 70s to early 90s I was spending like four months a year out in the field , making the most of the time by myself , so sort of the writing stuff remained sort of extremely critical , and it just kind of became rhythm , and sort of volumes of journals from out in the field whereas I can’t do anything remotely like that out here .
And it just become sort of a habitual thing out there , and slowly started doing stuff like bringing subjects I had been thinking about during the year here and did n’t have two minutes to concentrate on , would bring out there , and so would have a lot more unstructured time to work on it and just kind of slid into that .
I think , mid -grad school I sent what in retrospective was a extremely embarrassing article into Psychology Today on my baboon work , which they took — which says something or other — and then sort of like a year 's delay I then sent something to Discover magazine , which was sort of ranting about an area that I knew something about .
And there was this sort of transition that as I got a few more of these out , I started to be able to write about stuff that I knew absolutely nothing about and had no , like , had no grounds having any opinions on , and then they would start asking me to have some , like , unfounded opinion on something , which I would gladly oblige and it just sort of started spreading out from there .
HO : So , for one thing , all the journals , you started writing by hand , right ?
No computer , no typewriter .
RS : Eventually I got this really clunky journalist 's typewriter , from I do n’t know exactly where .
It ’s all gummed up with dust and there ’s bugs in all the keys and stuff .
You know , on an actual typewriter I can type somewhat effectively ; with this , and like the ribbon would get bleached out in the sun , and you could n’t write , but I would come back at the end of the season with scads of like stains on normal pieces of paper .
HO : Typed and handwritten .
And when you ’re typing and handwriting in a journal - type form do you go back and do some revision and concision and that or do you just plow ahead ?
RS : I tend to do the plow through , and then the edit afterward .
HO : Alright , it sounds like there was a key element of this in what you said is lots of unstructured free time .
RS : Yeah , a huge , huge issue .
I ’m frantically type A the rest of the year here , and out there things are extremely unstructured and open .
There ’s just absolutely nothing to do other than take a blood sample from a baboon once every forty - five minutes or so .
So much less , much less structured time .
What 's been a big challenge is , sort of adulthood has intervened , and I spend , like , maybe a month out in the field each year now at best .
So trying to figure out how to do my writing sitting in a style out there sort of sitting here instead .
That ’s been relatively hard to figure out .
HO : You only have so much free , unstructured time .
When you worked on , let ’s say , this book came first , right ?
So you had another book before this one , right ?
RS : Umm ... this very technical biology monograph that ’s like put happy smiles on the faces of the three people on earth who ’ve read it .
[ laughter ]
Mostly ignored .
HO : OK , well how did you find the time and how did you structure your work to be able to — and did it change over the course of the different types of book ?
RS : Umm … I think probably it came from the times … I live up in San Francisco , so I spend two hours a day on Caltrain , so I do a big percentage of my writing there and the phone ’s not going to ring and nobody ’s going to come in to ask me for a med school recommendation , and conductors leave me alone or whatever so that ’s , that ’s where I do my writing .
And it ’s actually gotten amazingly addictive .
It ’s a very , you know … anyone who does science , like nothing ever works when you ’re doing science and when it works it takes two and a half years to find out that it ’s worked .
It ’s a very different sort of metabolic rate than the writing stuff , where like you can find out in the course of an hour if this paragraph pleases you or not .
It ’s like teaching , sort of ; it ’s much faster .
So , sort of , if you ’re spending most of your time in the science , where it ’s this very holding your breath process .
The writing stuff just has much faster reinforcement rates , and so it ’s real addictive .
HO : And you ’re writing on the train with a laptop ?
RS : Yes .
HO : So how is then the experience versus the pushing along with the journal working with a laptop ?
RS : You know , actually , none of the writing — the editing sort of out in the field I would do by hand — but the actually writing would be on the clunky typewriter .
It would sort of go fast enough that it …I was not constrained to the speed of getting it down on paper ; so a computer has not been a big transition .
HO : So it ’s basically the same as the typewriter for you .
Because it sounds like you ’re doing a lot of the revision before you get to the keyboard ?
Looking at a draft and there ’s… RS : Stuff tends to come out fast .
So I do n’t spend a lot of time trying to get a phrase right .
That will come later .
So sort of having a fast machine in some sort really helps .
HO : Where do you get ideas for what you want to write about ?
I mean , how do they come to you ?
Clearly not on the train because you are writing on the train .
RS : Well , most of my writing is — sort of most of my non-science writing — are essays and wind up in various magazines in either science magazines for non-scientists like Natural History or Scientific American or whatever , or , like , doing science in non-science venues , the New Yorker or places like that , so it ’s a limited length that I have to produce .
And typically what happens is , you know , I am constantly reading about , just hopping around , subjects all over the place .
I read very broadly and very shallowly science outside my own area .
So just a huge array of areas that I ’m sort of tapping into and just read , like , crappy contemporary culture type stuff .
I 'm completely obsessed with People magazine ; it ’s the most fabulous source of material for science articles .
And it just …
HO : Explain that .
I can see the primate research , but …
RS :
You know , I ’m fairly socially disconnected .
I ’m an academic ; all I do is work and that sort of thing .
So I have no idea of what ’s going on out in most of the world out there and culture , so People magazine allows me to recognize , like , the names of the most important humans on earth for the next ten minutes and let ’s me understand why they ’ve broken up with whoever or like being a UN ambassador to a refugee camp or some such thing .
And it just , it gives you sort of an anchoring for cultural references and stuff .
So what tends to be is I ’ll just be reading along and stumble into something or other that ’s like really quirky and bizarre and will spend the next two months just obsessing over it and just reading everything possible .
Like I just sent a piece into the New Yorker that they took , which was prompted by this , like , half - page long piece in a neurology journal entitled ' Why we can't tickle ourselves ? ' .
It ’s actually extremely interesting and there ’s , like , a scientific explanation , and these people had actually like done experiments with a tickle machine where they showed what parameters you need to modify so that people can now tickle themselves .
And another group picked up on this and discovered a subset of schizophrenics who could tickle themselves .
So like this was just irresistible so I went berserk with this for about two months and wrote up something and downloaded it and — sort of my wife was finally pleased that I would stop like orating at her about ticking and all that — and sort of got it out of my system and then have n’t thought about it since .
And then just stumble into the next weird , quirky thing .
HO : Now , you said orating to your wife : do you read what you write out loud ?
RS : No .
I just like bore her by obsessing over it .
HO : And you do n't go through a complicated revision process ?
RS : I think probably less than most people who are like trained , serious writers .
HO : Let me , first of all , you ’re a trained , serious writer .
You do your own training , and serious stuff .
The other side is you take complicated scientific ideas and you ’re able to explain them in this step - by - step kind of way that make it accessible to people who are n't familiar with the science .
How do you do that ?
RS : Umm…well this is going to sound silly , but I was actually not terribly well - trained as a scientist in college ; I was much more of the social science type , so I actually never took any chemistry or physics in college and do n't have a very good fundamental grounding .
So I am easily panicked in my science and I think thus I can easily imagine more readily than most people in my position how somebody else can be .
I think sort of pedagogically where that came about : during grad school I wound up in a grad school that did n’t have an undergraduate college — it was just a research institute — so we did n't have to do the TAing stuff that grad students do here , and thought that was probably a bad thing sort of professionally , so I figured out a way to sneak off and moonlight , I was in New York at a place called The New School for Social Research , where they kind of hired me to moonlight on the side , and it like totally violated my fellowship and I had to like sneak off out the back way from my university and stuff .
And right around time there was this fashion institute in New York called Parsons School of Design that had just lost their academic accreditation — which it turned out to be , like , decades after that probably should have happened — and they decided , they went out and like shut out all their tenured non-design faculty and they forced their students to go over to The New School to take their courses .
And there was a science requirement and I was like offered one of the two science courses at the New School , so I would get these classes full of these unbelievably hostile , phobic , teeny - bopper textile designers , and this forced an enormous pressure to be clear , and to have a good sense as to when people are about to go berserk with too many terms and stuff and like when you have to stop and give an anecdote or metaphor or something , so I think in retrospect it was actually very good training .
I know every one of those people is now a chief of neurosurgery at a major medical center .
HO : So , it ’s the training of being able to explain things to people and then the impulse that you had initially , in some ways , to try to do so , to be able to break it down in that kind of way .
How did you feel , for example — in all of your books — but actually , for example , in A Primate ’s Memoir , you incorporate actually a great deal of wit and irony , just from conversation ?
Right ?
RS : I know that part .
HO : How did you design , for example , that book , because there ’s a chronology but it ’s also not a chronology .
You are always going back and forth , in terms of description of the baboon society .
And , you know , various instances grow step - by - step .
Did you write , like , one anecdote and then another anecdote , and then piece it together , or did you see it as a flow when you were doing it ?
RS : Yeah , um , most of my other books have each taken about two years to write and the Primate 's Memoir book took twelve years .
HO : Wow .
RS : I think one of the reasons for that was I really could only work on it in Kenya .
So I would have to wait for the summers , that , I just had to just get into the right state of mind for it .
Whereas with the other ones , you know , I could write in , like , sitting in the airport waiting for a flight , and you know I have a very up and down time .
So about eight years into it I just got with the others , who were this whole stack of stories , and sent it off to couple of my editors , and they informed me this was , like , not remotely ready yet , and it needed a chronology and had no sense of an overall shape to it .
And that took about four years to sort of figure out in there .
And initially , eventually — this is pathetic — but eventually it reached a point of having this big flow chart of stories that are set in particular periods and ca n’t be moved , and stories that are serious stories and monster stories , and long ones and short ones .
And I went through all these , like , really deep sort of algorithms for how to like satisfy as many of these constraints as possible , and each of the four sections of the book starts with a chapter about the baboons .
And then I actually went through this very mechanical algorithm of listing all the baboons , where they were introduced at which point , making in each chapter there was a reference back to somebody so that sort of the readers would be able to keep the thread of what ’s going on with the baboons throughout .
So I had this whole , like , mechanical structure which was much more mechanical than anything I had ever done in my science writing , and kind of shoe - horned everything into it , and it kind of worked .
HO : Sounds like the basic composition paper experience for lots of students : making this kind of diagram and putting things and rearranging things , but on a grander scale .
But this came after you had written quite a bit ?
RS : Yeah .
HO : So you ’ve written all of it , was then … ?
RS : And it was then a matter of getting the transitions with the new form and all the things .
HO : Right so …and then rearranging it in that way .
Did you paste up whole , like , here ’s a section and this section and maybe did you actually physically do it in that way , or … RS : No , it was just sort of moving pieces around and …
HO : So you had it in different files or whatever or literally file folders or you have a computer type thing to be able to arrange it in that way .
Did you have an editor at the publishers who besides giving that first feedback — this is n’t right , there needs to be more ?
RS : Umm…no .
HO : Did they do any copy editing ?
RS : Actually a small amount .
An odd thing with my books is that in all of them I ’ve always , I have n’t let anybody see them until they were done , except sort of sending the early draft to these couple of previous editors .
So , I 've never done the , like , sending in a thirty - page proposal and hoping to get a big advance , and they start harassing you about when you ’re getting it done .
Just because I decided long ago , you know , I am a scientist , this writing stuff is a hobby , and I ’m never going to be in a position where I ’ve , like , inadvertently gone and committed myself to write some book and the clock is ticking and I , like , really need to do my lab work instead ; so I never send it to an agent or any publisher until it is done .
So I 've actually never worked with an editor going back and forth on a piece .
The only exception I ever had — and likewise with the magazine pieces that I do where they always get pissed off at me because they much prefer somebody to come in and say “ I ’m thinking of doing a piece on X , are you guys interested ? ” and , like , the few times they ’ve come to me and go “ will you agree to something ? ” , I ’ve kind of hated it .
And so it leads to this anxiety because I ’ve got a deadline .
So I always send stuff in when it ’s finished .
The only time I ’ve ever worked heavily with an editor was this piece I had in The New Yorker , like , five years ago which wound up being on why we get less and less interested in novelty as we get older , we ’re less open to certain cultural experience , and it was prompted by this guy that I working as a secretary who just graduated as an English major and needed to make money for a couple years before going off to English grad school and starving , so he hung out for a couple years , and he was irritating the crap out of me because he was great at his work , but he was , like , pathologically open to new experience .
He was sitting out in the office out there , and everyday he ’s listening to a different style of music each day , like radically , like contemporary rock and then Gregorian chants and these irritating wedding songs and stuff like that .
And he would come in , one day — he like a beard and long hair — and one Monday morning he comes in , he ’s shaved everything off because he wants to see if people would relate to him differently that way .
Like , he would just like spend the whole weekend at , like , a festival of , like , twenty back - to - back Indian movie musicals just because he had never seen one and thought that would be interesting .
And he was just like totally depressing me , because I was sitting there having , like , not done anything new in about fifteen years , and this prompted this whole thing .
So I started off the piece basically with he had prompted this and how irritating this was , and this editor at the New Yorker who was , like , the most frightening thing I had ever dealt with , because this is the image of the most knowledgeable , scholarly person on earth .
In any subject that comes up , he ’s read four books on it , including all of my areas of science , which he knows much better than me and we would have these , like two hour phone conversations about , like , three sentences in there , and this was completely , like , novel for me , and I realized at some point , this guy who was working for me — his name was Paul — and at some point I was making some reference back to him at the beginning and something with the tone was wrong and I had this two hour conversation and like three - quarters of the way through , he says , “ The trouble is , the thing that ’s the core here , is Paul does n't want to grow up and be you , and you know that and it hurts you . ”
This is like , I almost burst into tears .
It was like I was having these therapy sessions .
And he was right .
Paul had betrayed me because he did n’t want to grow up and be like me .
And I like immediately had to call up Paul and , like , relate this to him , and this was the case , that in fact he had no desire to ever be , like , this narrow .
And , it immediately cleared up this one sentence .
And this was like the only I 've ever had the agonizing over , the editor keeping me from becoming an alcoholic by telling me the unresolved issue .
So like that one time , and I ’ve been scared of this guy ever since and never have dealt with him again .
HO : Most experiences with editors are more on the level of “ rewrite this . ”
RS :
This paragraph is n’t clearing up or can you put the lead for the story a couple of paragraphs up .
HO : I mean , a lot of writers , I mean literary writers , would love to have an editor like that , someone who really interacted with the whole essence of what you ’re trying to do .
RS : I ’m so frightened of this man .
HO : But , you know , with some of the things that you ’ve said , lead me to think , first of all , you do n't like writing for deadlines , right ?
RS : Yes , I wo n’t do it .
HO : But you do n’t have any problem getting yourself to write , actually , as long as there is n’t a deadline , right ?
RS : Yeah , and I have to actively discipline myself from not spending too much time on the writing ; it 's , just , it ’s fun ; it ’s easy .
HO : Yes , we do n't want to have fun , do we ? [ laughter ]
RS : OK .
HO : But you have other things to do .
RS : Yeah , and , you know , really some of you do this for a living and , like , you probably , like doing neurochemistry would be a great hobby on the side .
You know , the science stuff is incredibly slow , and it never works , and if screw up people , like , lose their jobs in your lab and things like that ; and this is just , you read some quirky article and you can just call up people and find what neato stuff they ’re doing and you just package it , and , like , you get it done and it ’s gone and you never think about it again .
And your pushing back the edges of science do n’t depend on it .
And it is just so much more relaxed than the science stuff .
Yeah , so I have to actively discipline myself from not doing too much .
HO : Uh-huh .
It ’s actually , you know , those who really aspire to be literary writers , get a job that ’s very anxiety producing .
And then you ’ll be just fine with the writing .
RS : You just got to balance it .
HO : And now , so consequently , also , you do n’t get stuck .
RS : Now and then , but basically not .
I find , I have an incredibly easy time getting pieces started ; I can never figure out how to end them , and that ’s — the last paragraph I sort of obsess about — but that ’s the only thing that gets me gummed up where I go and it ’s not obvious .
And I try a couple of really clunky things and that ’s really about the only element that just does n’t seem to flow .
HO : Do you ever show people — friends or something — something in progress ?
RS : Nah .
HO : Oh , ok .
RS : And I think it is still part of this sort of credibility thing and it just sort of seems silly , if like I 'm a scientist , and , “ Oh , I ’ve got a recent piece that I ’ve been working . ”
It just sort of seems ridiculous , so I sort of just like firmly send it off to one of these magazine and that sort of thing .
I actually have a whole section of my CV , where I was like too embarrassed to have some of these articles listed with the regular part of my CV , so I have a whole section that I call “ pieces in embarrassing places ” — um , with like GQ - type of piece that I am particularly by this , Men ’s Health , and so forth .
Scientists are not supposed to do stuff like that .
HO : Well , you know , it seems like , actually , well , in another interview perhaps , in another context it would be , you know , how does this affect your science , right ?
But it seems from the point of view of writing , the fact that this writing is fun , not essential , furtive , perhaps even silly , allows you to be a good writer .
RS : It certainly takes the pressure off ; there ’s no neurosis involved because I just save that for the science .
It ’s just relaxing , and it ’s relaxing in a sense of , like , many of the pieces are subjects where it ’s not just sort of neato getting engrossed in that , um , like , what a weird , quirky thing to write about , but all the pieces have some sort of goal or some sort of angle .
I 've got this whole cranky obsession with disliking genetic explanations for behavior , and think that that ’s really dangerous stuff and has had some sort of disastrous historical consequences .
So I sort of get on my high - horse about that , so there ’s some angles with that .
Or other pieces that I kind of quite disturbing , but it ’s fun to just sort of simmer in that for a while .
After my first child was born , my son , who ’s six now , like a week later , I suddenly found there ’s like psychiatric disorder that I have never found interesting in the slightest , called Munchausen 's - By - Proxy , which is this incredibly disturbing disease .
Munchausen 's disease is where people fake medical symptoms in themselves in order to get medical care .
And it ’s got nothing to do with getting out of work or insurance fraud , it ’s just there ’s something , like , neurotic and sensual about these people , getting medical care to the point that they will fabricate symptoms to get ten rounds of surgery , they will get limbs amputated .
There ’s a technical term for people with a psychiatric disorder of people who imagine themselves as not having limbs and will manipulate things , will like pull off industial to get , so this is Munchausen's .
Munchausen 's - By - Proxy is when a parent does it to their child , and generates symptoms .
This is not the coming and saying , “ Oh , every night my baby coughs from ten to eleven . ”
This is feeding your child poison , injecting you child with feces , like unbelievable stuff .
And a week after my son was born this disease I had vaguely known about for years and had n’t given a thought to suddenly struck me as the most horrifying disease I had ever heard of I my life , and I spent the next six months just reading everything there is out there on the subject and wrote a long piece on it for The Sciences , which was like , they had to force me to edit out some of sections because the writing was just too aggressive and too , like , incredibly emotionally in a froth about this thing , where it was great … it was great , I was , like , wildly upset about this .
I would just , like , read these case reports that were nightmarish things .
And packaging this whole up into one of the longer pieces I have ever written it was spectacularly cathartic .
So , like , that was fun in a strange definition of fun .
HO : Well , it was cathartic .
You know , one week after your child is born , it ’s a way of , kind of very concrete in a writing kind of way of dealing with your anxieties , not only anxieties about the child but maybe even anxieties about yourself , and being with a child and to investigate this sort of thing .
Look I want to open this up for everyone here to join the conversation .
I also want to pass these flyers around for the other “ How I Write ” events .
So if you can just pass it around while I ’m doing this .
A : My question is : do you ever use quotes to start a chapter ; and if so , how do you find the quotes that you use ?
RS : Umm…yeah , I do sometimes .
I actually just finished writing a chapter for a textbook on what stress has to do with memories where I was supposed address disorder for a psychiatry textbook , and I actually started off with a Faulkner quote , which is “ Not only is the past not dead , the past is n't even past ” ( where I did n’t get the wording exactly ) .
And , you know , this is pretty cool , and already I heard back from the editor of the text , and I ’ve actually never read a word of Faulkner in my life .
It ’s just I could n’t possibly understand it and this is way too boring and I never have time for it .
So , you know , I just constantly have supplies of this stuff , and I just frantically take notes on every little sort of thing and sort of everything eventually gets used .
And somewhere along the way , somewhere around the second edition of the Zebras book , where my books tend to have lots and lots of trivia in them , and sort of cultural history trivia stuff — that I actually started getting a research assistant who does library stuff for me .
Like , I 've got a piece right now in Discover magazine with Paul Ehrlich talking about why it is that we like stuff that ’s rare .
Why the fact that something is the last something on Earth is appealing to us , framing it in the context of conservation of what winds of happening is if you control something that ’s rare , like the Serengeti , and you go piss of it away to get immediate profits , the remaining half is at least twice as valuable because people will pay that much more because this is the last whatever on Earth .
And so we just started it off with just sort of this museums that have weirdo rare stuff in the world .
And , in fact , there 's this museum in Minnesota that ’s a zoo of like bizarre medical devices that eight thousand people a year come to make them see their prostate warmer and things like that .
And , like , there ’s some museum in Amarillo , Texas that has a sculpture of Jefferson Davies made out of six hundred deer antlers , and people fight to get in to see this stuff .
And so this would be the sort of thing where I would say to like some obsessive , factoid research assistant who ’s great at this stuff , “ Go and find out some weirdo stuff in museums all across the United States , ” and they ’ll come back with a long list of these things .
So I ’m heavily dependent on that right now .
A : Is there any neurological theory of narrative , and why story is so appealing to human beings ?
RS : Oh Christ , let me just first get a sense of grounding here .
Are you in the English department ?
A : No , I 'm a writer .
RS : OK … I just want to see like , how far this is from where I ’m coming from .
Never in my entire life would I consider using a sentence in which I would say , “ Is there a neurobiology to story ” instead of “ to how you write stories ” or “ how people like read stories ” or something with a ‘ s ’ at the end .
The whole notion of , like , “ story ” clearly puts in some academic realm that ’s outside my experience .
Umm …but in terms of that , there 's a whole sort of tradition that some people , biological anthropologists , looked at , like , ritual and stuff in different societies , and all societies get into ritual .
And somewhere in there they drag in oral tradition so you can see where I ’m flailing to try to connect this to literature .
And how they entrain rhythms in the brain , and the brain finds rhythmic patterns of action potentials to be reinforcing and this is basically gibberish ; there ’s like no neurological basis for that .
No doubt there is some neurological basis for , like , why people like stories and why every culture comes up with them .
But we 're centuries away from having any understanding of that .
A : My question is :
You ’ve been in the New Yorker and magazines like that and I feel like whatever questions the intellectual community is going after , your science writing has come just as close as any of them to answering .
And so my question is , kind of , how does science fit into that broad intellectual community ?
And it seems like , with you and Oliver Sacks , the best writing that applies to general intellectual stuff is neurology ; and could you talk about that a little ?
RS : I should point out , this guy was in my class last quarter , so he ’s obviously still in the habit of trying to make me feel good , in terms of getting a grade .
I agree , I the brain stuff is the most interesting , and sort of Oliver Sacks has like mobs of the world ’s , like , great neurological patients .
No , actually he ’s got this whole franchise by now that no one would dream of having a quirky neurological patient by now without sending them to him first .
So he just gets his next books just written for him .
It ’s this self - perpetuating .
You know , I could , obviously the temptation here is to go through a whole song and dance about how not only science but also my subdiscipline of science and in particular the version we were working on last Tuesday afternoon in my lab is going to solve the following list of world problems .
Because we all do that sort of thing , especially when we ’re trying to get funded .
Science is useful for some of this stuff ; science has also done spectacularly destructive things in its history , in terms of when ideologues have grabbed onto science and many cases have been scientists themselves who have been the ideologues and have done some incredibly destructive things .
Most of the time what science comes up it is completely perpendicular to anything that does either any good or any harm to society ; why we can't tickle ourselves is great , but this is not really terribly relevant to the human predicament .
But , you know , now and then it comes up with some stuff .
And the realms that strike me as most important to that is the stuff having to do with brain , and behavior , and who we are as individuals .
And , not to sort of run off into a tirade with this , but there ’s neurological disorders where you have a certain epileptic seizure for 30 seconds once every 6 months and it changes your level of religiosity the rest of your life .
There are neurological disorders due to a single gene ’s mutation where somewhere in your mid-forties to abandon your family , go run around , get drunk brawling , and have lots of affairs ; and two or three years later you ’re incapacitated in a neurology ward — because early - on this disease wipes out the part of your cortex that keeps you from doing things you think about but would never actually want to do .
And twenty five percent of people on death row have a type kind of neurological injury to that same part of the brain that controls impulsivity .
You know , this plays out into who we are , who we incarcerate , how we make judgments , how we have our sense of self - definition , blah , blah , blah ; it ’s incredibly pertinent to making sense of that stuff .
Most people do n’t want to go anywhere near science and should n’t be forced to .
A : Well then , should there be more scientists who do this ?
RS : If they are writing about something interesting that ’s accessible , sure , why not ?
A : As a teacher , as someone who often teaches writing , I want to thank you .
You ’ve given lots of great advice to teachers as well as students who are here today .
From my own experience as a writer who also enjoyed writing , I find that I do enjoy talking about my writing if not showing it to other people .
And I ’m intrigued by one little moment in your interview when you said you orate to your wife , right , and yet you do n't show to anyone in advance .
And I am wondering if , as is true for many of my students and myself as well , do you ever work things out by speaking it out ?
And you ’re obviously such a verbal person ; these orations , do you ever work out ideas by talking about them ?
RS : Umm…rarely ; mostly I just sort of download the factoids to my wife , sort of the Munchhausen ’s - By - Proxy sort of , every night tortured her with the seventeen reports I had found .
She ’s in there just sort of in the aftermath , glowing in motherhood , and I just sort of , “ Look at this , this is important here . ”
Umm…rarely , not really .
I pace a lot .
A : Then let me refine my question .
Is dialogue ever useful , you orate , you rant ?
Does she ever ask , you know , the question that crystallizes something or sends you off on a fruitful direction ?
RS : Yeah , she is very aggressive and skeptical .
And challenges all my assumptions and so that ’s a very good thing .
She is also a clinical psychologist and understands human behavior far more than I do .
Most of what I come up as explanations turn out to be really a crock , and she challenges them pretty effectively .
And so , yeah , definitely getting lots of feedback there , but it ’s turning into the writing stage I just kind of burn right through it .
A : Thank you .
A : Along the same lines as Valerie was asking , does an imagined audience play a part in how you write and how you explain things ?
And that experience as a TA was useful and I have read Why Zebras Do n't Get Ulcers , and I honestly never would have picked it up because I ’m on the literary side but a scientist friend of mine said , “ You have this ; it ’s great ” .
And I enjoyed it very much and it was very clear , but it ’s something that I would just never pick up because it was actually , I think , there in the self - help part , and for me that usually has a very bad connotation of , like , getting in touch with my inner zebra , which is something I have no desire to do .
But , so , do you really think about , what is going to be attractive about my book to a reader , and how is a reader going to pick up this book at the bookstore , and does that form a part of how you write and eventually , sort of , figure a title and the overall presentation of your book ?
RS : Yeah , definitely .
By the way I should note here that I fought tooth - and - nail to get the book not in the self - help section , but my publisher thought that would do wonders for sales , which apparently it does .
No , I ’m not going to do that .
I do n't so much think of a reading audience as much a lecture audience just because I do tons and tons of lecturing .
So the Zebra book grew out of , I do these continuing medical education lectures for nurses and psychologists , where it ’s this all - day six hour lecture , that I do this whole day course on stress and disease .
And the Zebra book directly came out of it .
But I think I am very frequently thinking of , sort of , lecture audiences .
And sort of pertinent to that , I ’ve got two pieces that I ’ve written that I wrote in this sort of , I do n’t know what , adjective , I was in a very agitated state a couple of weeks after my father died where for one thing , it was extremely instructive that if that had happened ten years earlier — I had been a concert pianist up through college — that I would have been playing the piano at that point .
Instead , the clearest evidence that the transition had occurred emotionally was that I was writing instead and it was serving its purpose .
Um , but sort of during the final stretch when he was kind of falling apart and off to the hospital and that I found just as a sheer coping mechanism that I was just obsessively distancing all it and turning it into lectures .
How would I lecture about this subject ?
OK , here ’s the variables that they do n’t understanding and that goddamn doctor who ’s not doing anything , who ’s unwilling to make the blah , blah .
But just turning it all into lectures triggered this distancing mechanism , but where it definitely served a purpose emotionally afterward .
So , yeah , that ’s definitely the case .
A : Though you probably would n’t agree that you meant to make yourself so interesting , you did .
And I was really struck from the beginning how you protested too much .
You know , “ I ’m not a writer , ” that ’s the first thing you said .
“ I ’m not a writer ; I ’m a scientist ” .
And it became so abundantly clear you are so open about your process , that you are not only a writer and you do n't just do it to relax — you know , you could play golf for that or something — but you are a writer who really needs to write .
And you described some need that propelled you into it from the beginning , still does , and you use words like “ obsessive ” or “ addictive ” .
And it fulfills all kinds of great needs , so I ’d like it — this is really an observation , but maybe the last thing will be a question — so , would you agree — after my little presentation — that you ’re not only a writer but an artist ?
That was the impression I had .
RS : Yeah , right , I 'm really going to say yes to that !
You know , like a year ago I had this bizarre day where I was in a scientific conference up in San Francisco like all day , and then in the evening I had this like completely sort of different experience , in that this Bay Area Book Reviewers club or association or something or other was having an annual book awards thing HO : Bay Area Book Reviewers Awards by the Independent Book Sellers Association .
RS : Yeah .
So they sort of have this evening thing in the library up in San Francisco , this whole reception thing , and I went to it .
And so I had spent the whole day at a science conference and I then spent the evening with all of these obviously writers and the contrast was just unbelievable .
It just so clearly , you know , C. P. Snow and two cultures and all of that , which probably is a measure of…oh , C. P .
Snow was a physicist who turned into a writer who had some famous essay or lecture in the fifties about how we ’re getting two cultures — the humanities and the sciences — sort of that ’s another obligatory quote ; I ’ve never actually read C.P. Snow .
It was simply because all of these writers had so many more facial expressions than scientists , they wore clothes that had primary colors in them , they would like touch your upper arm when they spoke to you and things like that that a scientist does n’t do .
It was clearly like just a very different world .
So , you know , I am dependent on this and all of that , but it seems like a very different world .
A : When you write something for an educational purpose — and I guess you would try to make it simple with fewer concepts so people ’s eyes do n’t start to glaze over — do you think you lose something versus sort of more traditionally serious scientific work ?
Do you get less information across ?
Is it more cartoonish in some sense ?
RS : That depends on heavily on whether you ’re a fellow scientist or not .
Since most scientists that I know think decide there is absolutely no way they could to do without becoming totally simplistic and distortive .
And there 's even a snotty term in science for what this is about .
Carl Sagan with his billions and billions of stars , he ’s like the most successful science writer of his time , and , as a result of doing that , he totally destroyed his scientific career .
And the snotty term that ’s used for it among scientists is , that one gets “ Saganized . ”
There ’s a presumption that if you ’re spending so much time doing this that you can’t possibly do good , serious science any more .
And it actually , it did quite literally damage his professional career .
So there ’s an assumption that they cannot be simplified or whatever , and , you know , obviously there ’s a certain amount of distortion that comes in with it , but , you know — back to the question before — people really need to learn this stuff .
Like , one of my favorite pieces is … I constantly crank out pieces that get back to the same theme : “ genes do not determine behavior , genes do not determine anything , there ’s next to no genetic determinism , this is politically dangerous , blah , blah . ”
And like most of them wind up being really preachy and irritating .
But I had this that works — I think it ’s one of the pieces that I like the most that I ’ve done — where like three years ago People magazine had their annual issue of fifty most beautiful people in the world , while I avidly read for months at a time .
And what they do is they have sort of a theme each year .
And that year their theme was “ nature or nurture , what explains the secrets of the fifty most beautiful people on Earth ? ”
And they asked each one of these people where they thought their beauty came from .
This was like to die for , you could not have asked for more ludicrous , fabulous stuff .
And the people who like had these utterly bizarre environmentalist stances .
What ’s his name , Ben Affleck said it ’s all due to his cosmetic dentistry .
This was his explanation .
And then the other extreme : Gwyneth Paltrow had her grandfather come in and says , “ She was like this from birth , ” which makes sense of probably why the two of them did n't stay together as a pair , and I actually know that because if People magazine did n’t write it , I ’d have no idea who these people are .
And this was like perfect , and I wound up writing this very sarcastic piece about the fifty most beautiful people in the world debate the nature - nurture question .
And sort of they set it up so that it ’s obviously ludicrous , and there was like one person in there who came up with what ’s accepted as the scientific , like , resolution to that , which is , genes affect how you interact with the environment and the environment affects how you interact with your genes , which was some singer who only had one name — and I ca n’t even remember who it is anymore .
But her mother was explaining , “ It 's all due to her cosmetics ’ skill ” — OK , this sounds like a fairly environmentalist — and then she says “ she was just born knowing how to put on make - up ! ” A gene - environment interaction — this is exactly !
And said this is great , can you believe this , I think this is fabulous , too bad people can't think about this when they think about what genes have to do with IQ or aggression or criminality , which was the last sentence of the piece .
So , you know , hopefully it serves a purpose , but it has to be simplified and lots of scientists will get on you for it .
HO : Let me follow up just briefly on that , which is : has your scientific reputation been jeopardized by writing for the broader audience ?
I mean , but you have n’t been saying that .
RS : Um , I am convinced that this is the case , but this is probably just my rationalizing every time I get a crappy grant score .
Every now and then I do get evidence that this is the case .
Because all I have to do — with science stuff what you do is write a paper , and you send it in to some professional journal and it ’s reviewed anonymously .
And this is this amazing dis-inhibitory process that allows people to be just total shits to each other in this business , and it ’s really like brutal .
And I am guaranteed if in some paper of mine — with one that I ’ve written instead of obviously if someone in my lab reporting primary data with sort of a large review paper — all I need is like one incoherent sentence in there , and there is going to be a snotty comment , “ Boy , for someone who publishes in this and that , that was sure incoherent ; I have no idea what you ’re saying ! ”
HO :
You mean , anonymous in the sense of you do n’t know who they , but they know who you are .
RS : They know who I am .
So it ’s a really good realm for settling scores , and undermining stuff .
It ’s a very childish arena of science .
HO : One last question because we ’re going to finish up .
A : I read that New Yorker article five years ago and was wondering what effect that revelation that you came to the conclusion about had on your life .
Do you listen to new music and eat sushi ?
RS : Um , It ’s had no impact whatsoever .
And it reflects very much the fact that I ’m like this expert on stress and stress - related disease and how it ’s bad for you .
And I ’m like unbelievably stressed ; all it means is like I can give you very detailed explanations for why I ’m going to get a coronary .
You know , it does n’t translate into you know …
A : It sounds like you were resolving at the end of that .
RS : I was , I was sort of laboring to come up with pretty , pretty inept reasons for why this in fact was a good thing , and sort of actually it ’s had no impact whatsoever .
As the purpose of writing : to keep it at a distance .
HO : Ah-hah .
Well , I want to thank you very much for coming .
RS : Thank you .
HO : Please , everyone .
[ Applause ]
I just want to say if you ever do get “ Saganized , ” there is the rest of the universe , billions and billions of people who would appreciate reading the things that you write .
Thanks a lot .
DIGG THIS
Americans actually have an interesting 2008 presidential candidate — Ron Paul .
As Thomas Woods pointed out in " The Revolutionary Candidate " ( posted 3/26 at LewRockwell.com ) , " He is a bigger supporter of the free market than anyone in Congress , but he 's also the most consistent opponent of war . "
He would indeed be a revolutionary change in Washington , because he represents the ideals Americans fought a revolution for over two centuries ago .
In a long public life , Dr. Paul has always kept faith with the limited defensible role for our federal government .
He has n't sold out that vision to " buy " goodies extorted from others via government coercion , truly representing those disenchanted with the ballooning size and scope of government .
As a result , he has been criticized , including by those in his own party , for failing to " go along to get along " or look the other way at poorly thought out proposals and policies , both foreign and domestic .
Yet what better qualification is there for an office charged with benefiting all of us , rather than some of us at others ' expense ?
He simply knows that both logic and evidence imply that better government requires far less government .
A fan of the Constitution , Paul upholds its strict limitation of the federal government to those roles enumerated in the Constitution .
Instead of fostering wasteful bureaucracies and boondoggles that erode individual rights and incentives , government 's role is to establish and enforce property rights , equally applied , so all citizens can increase their welfare through voluntary exchanges .
In that world , lobbyists could not use government to pick citizens ' pockets , and incomes would have to be earned by actually creating something worth more than it costs to others .
Perhaps alone among those plying their trade in Washington , Paul recognizes and opposes the central danger of government :
Its power will be captured by organized special interests and used to advance narrow objectives by imposing costs on others .
He seems to be the only one inside the beltway acting on the reality that it is impossible for all citizens to gain from this , as those that cannot compete as effectively in the political arena of special interest must lose from the government transfer game .
Ron Paul is best defined by what he would not do .
He has steadfastly opposed war .
He rejects domestic subsidies and beggar - thy - neighbor policies on the same basis .
He would not support government policies that , while depriving taxpayers of income and restricting citizen choices , do not achieve their intended results .
He does not support government redistribution of wealth , as it forces involuntary , harmful " trades " on citizens without their consent .
He does n't want to " soak the rich , " as he recognizes that the way for sellers of goods and services to get wealthier in a market economy is to make others better off , and therefore willing to voluntarily buy from them ( a characteristic not shared by government interventions ) .
Essentially , Ron Paul wants to treat Americans as adults , rather than as children constantly begging their parents to give them what they want .
He believes in freedom from taxes that fund wasteful and ineffective programs and freedom from a government powerful and intrusive enough to routinely override individual choices , when those choices do not infringe on the rights of others .
Verifying Dr. Paul 's consistent , principled approach is also easy .
His voting record in the House speaks for itself .
In addition , he has expressed his beliefs extensively , in a clear , consistent and substantive manner .
The Foreign Policy of Freedom , recently released , lays out those beliefs in the international area .
But his domestic policy stands are also easily available , with articles archived at LewRockwell.com .
Consider the following excerpts , all from the past year 's archive , as an indication of where he stands :
" We can't tax , borrow , and inflate forever .
That 's what we 've been doing , and our obligations are overwhelming . "
" Whether it 's a war on drugs , a war on illiteracy , or a war on whatever , people say u2018 well , it 's a war ; we have to be willing to sacrifice our liberties and let the government take care of us '… we would be safer and we would be more economically secure if we assumed responsibility for ourselves . "
" It ’s hypocritical and childish to dismiss certain founding principles simply because a convenient rationale is needed to justify interventionist policies today .
The principles enshrined in the Constitution do not change . "
" [ Courts ] routinely rubber stamp egregious violations of the 1st , 4th , and 5th Amendments , and allow Congress to legislate wildly outside the bounds of its enumerated powers . "
" Most of our mistakes can be laid at the doorstep of our failure to follow the Constitution . "
" We must rethink the very role of government in our society .
Anything less , any tinkering or ‘ reform , ’ wo n't cut it . "
" We forget that those powers not explicitly granted to Congress by the Constitution are inherently denied to Congress . "
" … politicians are not supposed to have power over us — we ’re supposed to be free .
We seem to have forgotten that freedom means the absence of government coercion . "
" Remember that one ’s relationship with the state is never voluntary .
Every government edict , policy , regulation , court decision , and law ultimately is backed up by force … .
That is why political power must be fiercely constrained by the American people . "
" Our constitutional system …was designed to restrain political power and place limits on the size and scope of government . "
" In a free society , government is restrained — and therefore political power is less important .
I believe the proper role for government in America is to provide national defense , a court system for civil disputes , a criminal justice system for acts of force and fraud , and little else . "
" … with truly limited government , [ i] t simply would not matter much who occupied various political posts , since their ability to tax , spend , and regulate would be severely curtailed .
This is why champions of political power promote an activist government that involves itself in every area of our lives from cradle to grave . "
" Political power is inherently dangerous in a free society : it threatens the rule of law , and thus threatens our fundamental freedoms .
Those who understand this should object whenever political power is glorified . "
" We get into trouble by not following the precepts of liberty or obeying the rule of law . "
" We cannot suspend the laws of economics or the principles of human action any more than we can suspend the laws of physics .
Yet this is precisely what Congress attempts to do time and time again , no matter how many times history proves them wrong … "
" If … you [ pay ] $ 1000 less in taxes next year , have you taken something from the government that rightfully belongs to it ?
Or has the government simply taken less from you ?
You do n't cost the government money , the government costs you money ! "
" Taxes never create prosperity . "
" Most importantly , federal spending must be dramatically reduced so that all Americans can go back to working for themselves instead of working to pay their taxes . "
" Once we accept that the federal government needs [ trillions ] from us — and more each year — the only question left is from whom it will be collected .
Until the federal government is held to its proper constitutionally limited functions , tax reform will remain a mirage . "
" I apply a very simple test to any proposal to overhaul the tax code :
Does it reduce or eliminate an existing tax ?
If not , then it amounts to nothing more than a political shell game that pits taxpayers against each other in a lobbying scramble to make sure the other guy pays .
True tax reform is as simple as cutting or eliminating taxes . "
" Politicians throughout history have tried to solve every problem conceivable to man , always failing to recognize that many of the problems we face result from previous so - called political solutions .
Government cannot be the answer to every human ill .
Continuing to view more government as the solution to problems will only make matters worse . "
" Money and power are important only because the government wields power not granted by the Constitution .
A limited , constitutional government would not tempt special interests to buy the politicians who wield power . "
" The big government nanny - state … assumes people are not smart or responsible enough to take care of themselves , and thus their needs must be filled through the government 's forcible redistribution of wealth .
Our system of intervention assumes that politicians and bureaucrats have superior knowledge , and are endowed with certain talents that produce efficiency .
These assumptions do n't seem to hold much water … "
" With no consistent moral defense of true liberty , the continued erosion of personal and property rights is inevitable .
This careless disregard for liberty , our traditions , and the Constitution have brought us disaster … "
" A real solution to our problems will require a better understanding of , and greater dedication to , free markets and private property rights … .
Our liberties and our prosperity depend on it . "
" … one has to wonder how Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin would react to the current state of affairs .
After all , they were outraged by mere import tariffs of a few pennies on the dollar .
Today , the average American pays roughly 50 percent of their income in direct and indirect taxes . "
" … [ many ] are not bashful about using government power to do ‘ good ’… always speaking of the noble goals while ignoring the inevitable failures and evils caused by coercion … .
Once we concede government has this u2018legitimate ' function … constitutional limits on power and its mandate to protect liberty are totally forgotten . "
" … government action rarely solves any problem , but rather worsens existing problems or creates altogether new ones . "
Ron Paul is the only presidential candidate who has the principles and character to stand for truly Constitutional government .
He has resisted the explosion in federal power and its intrusion , both foreign and domestic , at every turn .

The Minsky Register Machine ( MRM ) is a model of computation equivalent in power to the Turing Machine .
A Universal MRM ( URM ) can be built which can emulate any other MRM by encoding its instructions and register contents as initial values of the URM 's registers .
On 11th November 2002 I completed the construction of a Life pattern , based on Dean Hickerson 's Sliding Block Memory , which implements the actions of a URM .
It is a true model of universal computation in Life .
Unlike the finite tape of Paul Rendell 's marvellous Turing Machine , the values in the URM 's registers are unbounded .
Version 0 of the URM is large ( 268,096 live cells in an area of 4,558 x 21,469 ) and slow ( 20 gen /s using Johan Bontes 's Life32 on a 400MHz AMD K6 - II ) .
I plan further versions which I hope will improve on these figures , producing at best a quadratic increase in speed .

Design Overview
The pattern is constructed on a lattice of 30x30 squares .
Lightweight Spaceships ( LWSSs ) are used to communicate between components , which have P60 logic ( except for Registers - see below ) .
A LWSS takes 60 generations to cross a lattice square .
Every 60 generations , therefore , any inter-component LWSS ( pulse ) is in the same position relative to the square it 's in , allowing for rotation .
Seven components are used in the construction : Register , Latch , Split Left , Split Right , Merge Left , Merge Right , and Eater .
All inputs and outputs of a component are aligned spatially on lattice squares and temporally at the correct P60 phase .
A component is quiescent until a single input pulse arrives .
The input pulse triggers some activity in the component , which results some time later in the production of zero , one or two output pulses and possibly an internal state change .
After all processing is complete , the component re-enters its quiescent state .
Only one input pulse at a time is processed by each component .
Multiple pulses may exist concurrently .
More than one pulse may be heading for the same component at the same time , but are never required to arrive synchronously at that component .
The overall layout of the components ensures that pulses heading for the same component arrive sufficiently well - spaced and in the correct order where necessary .
Overall Layout
A description of a Cellular Automaton which was used as the blueprint for the design and operation of Life MRMs can be found here .
An MRM is made up of nine regions ( Figure 1 ) .
Left - to - right at the top : Latch Header
The small area in the top - left corner ; converts Z and NZ pulses to Latch read and clear pulses Register Table Along the top ; the chief state information storage for the URM Left - to - right across the middle : Latch Table Down the left side ; marks potential next instructions Loopback Pulse Eater Table A thin column of eaters just right of the Latches ; consumes loopback pulses .
Branch Table
The irregular area right of the eaters ; branch Splits generate branch pulses from loopback pulses to control program execution flow .
Loopback Table
The relatively solid column just right of the Branch Table ; loopback Splits and Merges generate loopback pulses from execution pulses .
NOP / HALT Eater Table Occasional eaters to the right of the Loopback Table ; consumes execution pulses for NOP and HALT instructions .
Operation Table
The sparse irregular area on the right ; operation Merges redirect execution pulses upwards towards the Registers .
At the bottom : Latch Footer Below the Latches ; four eaters to consume Latch read and clear pulses .
Ten different kinds of pulse are used to communicate between MRM components :
Execution Rightward from Latch or branch - end Merge to operation Merge or NOP / HALT eater .
INC Upward from operation Merge to Register .
DEC Upward from operation Merge to Register .
Loopback Downward from loopback Split , then leftward from loopback Merge through branch Splits to eater .
Branch Upward or downward from branch Split to branch - end Merge .
Latch Set Leftward from branch - end Merge to Latch .
NZ Leftward from Register to Latch Header .
Z Leftward from Register to Latch Header .
Latch Read Downward from Latch Header through Latches to eater .
Latch Clear Downward from Latch Header through Latches to eater .
The sole initial pulse is an execution pulse .
Operation
As each instruction is performed , both an execution pulse and a loopback pulse for that instruction are generated .
The operation of the four kinds of instruction is as follows :
HALT
The execution pulse is consumed by an eater .
The loopback pulse generates no branch pulses and is consumed by an eater .
Thus no further instructions are executed .
Other pulses may still be en route even after the HALT instruction completes , so the final state of the machine should not be read before the absence of all pulses .
NOP
The execution pulse is consumed by an eater .
The loopback pulse generates one branch pulse to the next instruction .
INC
The execution pulse generates an INC pulse for the appropriate Register .
The loopback pulse generates one branch pulse to the next instruction .
Since the generation of the branch pulse is immediate , INC ( and NOP ) instructions are in effect " pipelined " .
DEC
This is by far the most complex instruction .
The execution pulse generates a DEC pulse for the appropriate Register .
The loopback pulse generates two branch pulses , which in turn generate two Latch set pulses for the Latches associated with the two possible next instructions according to whether the DEC instruction passes or fails .
There are two kinds of Latch , the NZ ( pass ) Latch and the Z ( fail ) Latch .
They have the same design , but are aligned at different horizontal offsets within the Latch Table .
NZ Latches are aligned to the right side of the Latch Table ; Z latches are aligned to the left side of the Latch Table .
An instruction which has no associated Latch is never the next instruction after a DEC instruction .
An instruction may have an NZ Latch or a Z Latch but not both .
Any instruction in the original MRM which is the target of both pass and fail branches is split into two instructions , the first a NOP , by the Life MRM pattern - builder software .
The Latch associated with the next instruction after the DEC instruction if it passes is always an NZ latch .
The Latch associated with the next instruction after the DEC instruction if it fails is always a Z latch .
Thus the two branch pulses generated by the DEC instruction ultimately set one NZ Latch and one Z Latch .
The DEC pulse attempts to decrement the appropriate Register , which some time later outputs either an NZ ( pass ) or a Z ( fail ) pulse towards the Latch Header .
The Latch Header generates two pulses , a Latch read pulse and a Latch clear pulse .
An NZ pulse from the Register generates a Latch read pulse aligned with the NZ Latches and a Latch clear pulse aligned with the Z Latches ; conversely , a Z pulse from the Register generates a Latch read pulse aligned with the Z Latches and a Latch clear pulse aligned with the NZ Latches .
In the case of an NZ result , the Latch read pulse activates each NZ Latch in turn .
Cleared Latches ignore the pulse .
The single NZ Latch set by the DEC instruction generates an execution pulse for its instruction , and the Latch is cleared .
The Latch clear pulse activates each Z Latch in turn , and ensures that the Latch is cleared .
A Z result similarly executes the instruction associated with the single set Z Latch and ensures all Latches are cleared .
The layout of the MRM ensures that a Latch set pulse arrives before its associated Latch read and clear pulses , even though in large MRMs it may be the case that the read and clear pulses begin their journey from the Latch Header before one or both Latch set pulses have been processed .
In a large MRM , multiple Latch read and clear pulses may be en route , but the layout of the MRM again ensures that inputs to individual Latches always arrive in the right order .
Components Eater
Split Left and Split Right
Merge Left and Merge Right
Latch
Register Eater
The Eater has one input and no outputs .
It is just a standard eater .
Split Left and Split Right Each Split component has one input and two outputs .
A Heisenburp reaction deletes a glider from a P60 gun ( from Jason Summers 's edition of Dieter Leithner and Peter Rott 's gun collection ) , which in turn allows another P60 glider through to the orthogonal bees to generate a LWSS ( by Paul Rendell and Paul Callahan ) .
Merge Left and Merge Right Each Merge component has two inputs and one output .
An input LWSS from either of two orthogonal directions destroys a glider in a stream suppressing the output from the P30 LWSS gun ( by Dean Hickerson ) , thus allowing an LWSS to escape .
Latch The Latch is based on a reaction ( obtained from Mark D. Niemiec 's comprehensive library of glider syntheses , most by David Buckingham ) in which two gliders coming from opposite directions synthesize a block which is offset from one of the glider paths sufficiently to avoid being hit by subsequent gliders on that path .
The presence of the block means that the Latch is in the set state ; the absence of the block means that the Latch is in the clear state .
The Latch has three inputs and three outputs .
Two of the outputs , Latch read and Latch clear , are merely respective copies of the input of the same name .
The Latch set input pulse arrives from the right .
It is converted to a NE glider using Dieter Leithner and Stephen Silver 's P30 LWSS - to - glider converter ( also from Jason Summers 's collection ) , which comprises a pentadecathlon and a clock .
This glider reacts with a SW glider from a P60 gun to create a block as described above .
Incidentally , the Latch set input is actually a toggle : if the Latch is in the set state , an input pulse will clear it .
However , this feature is not used here .
The Latch clear input pulse arrives from above , between the right - hand pair of P60 guns on the left .
A Heisenburp reaction destroys a glider in the SW suppressing stream , allowing a SE glider to escape towards the main part of the Latch .
The SE glider in turn destroys a NE glider in a supressing P30 stream , which releases a SE block detection glider heading for the site of the Latch state block .
If the block is present , the glider destroys it .
If it is absent , the glider passes through a gap in the SW P60 stream and is eaten .
The Latch read input pulse also arrives from above but activates the left - hand Heisenburp detector .
In this case , the resulting SE glider reacts with a glider from a P30 gun and a block using Dieter Leithner 's signal duplicator reaction ( from David Bell 's pattern collection which is listed on Stephen Silver 's Life Page ) , deleting a glider from the same suppressing P30 stream referred to above , and creating a new SE glider which is reflected NE by a buckaroo ( by David Buckingham ) .
If the block is absent , the SE block detection glider and the NE glider from the buckaroo annihilate one another .
If the block is present , the block detection glider destroys it , thus clearing the Latch , and the unhindered NE glider from the buckaroo deletes a NW glider from a suppressing stream , which allows the escape of a rightward LWSS from the P30 LWSS gun to form the main Latch output .
Register The Register is based on ( and would not have been constructed without ) Dean Hickerson 's P120 Sliding Block Memory ( SBM ) , which I have updated slightly by replacing the P120 gun available at the time of its original design with a smaller modern version .
This part of the component can be easily identified by its compact and efficient design .
The distance of a block NE from the diagonal marked by two long boats towards the upper right of the Register represents the nonnegative value held by it .
Note that I interpret as the value zero a position of the block which Hickerson in his original description interprets as the value one , and that therefore what Hickerson interprets as a transition from one to zero , I interpret as a transition from zero to minus one .
I shall not describe the SBM further , except to note that the P120 increment and decrement suppression streams and the P120 transition detector stream serve the same purposes here .
The Register has four inputs and two outputs .
Two of the inputs , NZ and Z , are merely copied respectively to the output of the same name by the merge subcomponents .
Each of the operation input pulses , INC and DEC , arrives from below .
Each is detected by a P60 - to - P120 converter of my own design ; the detector at the very bottom of the Register detects an INC input pulse on the left , while the detector immediately above detects a DEC input pulse on the right .
The converter comprises a pair of P120 guns , the upper one a standard on - off - off - off , and the lower one an on - off - off - on of my own design .
The first pair of gliders collide to create a block .
The final glider from the lower gun destroys the block .
The block thus lives for slightly fewer than 90 generations .
A correctly positioned LWSS arriving while the block exists destroys it , and the next glider from the lower gun escapes .
With correct timing , therefore , the block is destroyed by any P60 LWSS , and a P120 glider timed to the SBM is released .
The NW P120 glider generated by an INC input pulse is reflected by a series of twelve buckaroos up the left side of the Register , eventually hitting the back of the P30 gun which creates the P120 SBM increment suppression stream .
It thus suppresses a glider from the suppression stream , in turn causing the value held by the SBM to be incremented .
The NE P120 glider generated by a DEC input pulse immediately suppresses the suppression stream of a p30 LWSS gun , sending an ( intra - component ) LWSS up the right side of the Register .
This LWSS hits a P30 glider stream , and a signal duplicator reaction eventually produces two gliders , one heading NE and the other SW .
The SW glider takes a circuitous journey around the diamond shape created by the two back - to - back merge subcomponents .
It is reflected SE , NE , NW by buckaroos , and then SW and SE by two P8 reflectors ( by Noam Elkies ) .
Its fate then depends on whether it encouters another glider ( the Z glider ) or not .
But supposing it does n't , it is further reflected by three more buckaroos , SW , SE and finally NE , towards the glider stream circulating below the lower of the two merge subcomponents .
It annihilates a glider in that stream , in turn releasing an NZ output pulse heading left .
The NE glider from the duplicator is reflected NW by a buckaroo into the back of the P120 gun producing the SBM decrement suppression stream .
It thus suppresses a glider from the suppression stream , in turn causing the value held by the SBM to be decremented .
If the SBM held a nonzero value before it was decremented , the transition detection glider survives ( as usual during the Register 's quiescent state ) .
This glider in turn goes through a signal duplicator .
The ( positive logic ) NW glider from the duplicator suppresses a SW stream ( the Z stream ) from a P120 gun ( with the help of a SE stream from a P60 gun at the very top of the register , needed because the NW - SW glider reaction is n't a clean annihilation ) .
The ( negative logic ) gap left in the SW stream from the duplicator is timed to allow the P120 increment suppression glider through .
If the SBM held zero ( and was therefore decremented to minus one ) , the transition detection glider is destroyed .
No hole is created in the SW stream from the duplicator , and thus the increment suppression stream is interrupted , in turn immediately causing the SBM to be incremented , thus restoring its value to zero .
The absence of a glider in the NW stream from the duplicator in turn allows a SW glider to escape along the Z stream .
If it is created , the Z glider is reflected NW by a buckaroo , then SW by a P8 reflector .
It then zigzags down the left side , reflected by the other end of each of five buckaroos which are also used to guide the INC glider upwards .
( This two - way buckaroo ladder is of my own design . )
The Z glider exits the ladder by being reflected SW by a P8 reflector , then SE by a buckaroo , and heads for a signal duplicator ( narrowly missing the circuitous glider ) .
The straight - ahead output from the duplicator annihilates a glider in the stream circulating above the upper of the two merge subcomponents , in turn releasing a Z output pulse heading left .
The ( negative logic ) output of the duplicator is inverted to a SW glider by a P30 gun ; this glider is reflected NE by the pentadecathlon , and annihilates the circuitous glider .
Thus overall , if the decrement succeeds , the circuitous glider survives to cause the output of an NZ pulse .
If the decrement fails , the Z glider causes both the destruction of the circuitous glider , and the output of a Z pulse .
If even one person has actually read through this and followed the operation in one of the MRM patterns , then it has been worth writing .
WASHINGTON , Feb .
18 — Senior leaders of Al Qaeda operating from Pakistan have re-established significant control over their once - battered worldwide terror network and over the past year have set up a band of training camps in the tribal regions near the Afghan border , according to American intelligence and counterterrorism officials .
American officials said there was mounting evidence that Osama bin Laden and his deputy , Ayman al - Zawahri , had been steadily building an operations hub in the mountainous Pakistani tribal area of North Waziristan .
Until recently , the Bush administration had described Mr. bin Laden and Mr. Zawahri as detached from their followers and cut off from operational control of Al Qaeda .
The United States has also identified several new Qaeda compounds in North Waziristan , including one that officials said might be training operatives for strikes against targets beyond Afghanistan .
American analysts said recent intelligence showed that the compounds functioned under a loose command structure and were operated by groups of Arab , Pakistani and Afghan militants allied with Al Qaeda .
They receive guidance from their commanders and Mr. Zawahri , the analysts said .
Mr. bin Laden , who has long played less of an operational role , appears to have little direct involvement .
Scene at immigration counter .
him :
So where do you come from now , sir ?
( flips through my passport , filled with stamps in Arab writing )
me : Right now , from London Heathrow , but that was just a transit .
I flew in from Cairo , Egypt .

I work for the UN , you see .
him :
Do you have any tickets to prove that ?
me : No , I flew on a UN plane .
him : I do not see Iraq immigration stamps in your passport .
me : No , there is no Iraq immigration anymore since the war .
The US military checks inbound passengers , but they do not stamp passports .
him : OK , how long where you there for ?
me : A week .
him :
So where were you longer than a week ?
Where do you actually live ?
me : Well , my legal residency is in Belgium , but I spend most of my time in the UAE .
In Dubai .
him :
What do you do there ?
me : I head the office of one of the UN agencies there .
I have the status of an ambassador .
him :
Do you have proof of that ?
me : Sure .
{ I show him my UAE diplomatic card )
him :
How long have you been living in Dubai ?
me : Two years .
him :
And before that ?
me : I shuttled between Pakistan and Afghanistan
him : …
him : ( after two minutes of typing on his computer )
Could you step aside for a moment , sir , and come with me ?
me : ?!
Thirty minutes later , in a separate room with clearly a number of other ‘ doubtful cases ’ :
him # 2 : Mr Keyscher ( ? ) ( it is difficult to pronounce my name in English )
me : Yes , sir , good evening .
him #2 : Evening , what is the purpose of your visit to the US ?

me : To Dubai
him #2 : Do you have any other travel documentation than this passport , your Belgian national passport ?
me : Yes , I have two UN passports
him #2 : Blue or red ones ?
( the red one is a full diplomatic passport )
me : I have both .
( I hand them over )
him #2 : Why do you travel on your Belgian passport , if you have a UN passport ?
me : It is easier , as I do not need a visa to enter the US with my Belgian one .
him #2 : Have a seat sir , someone will be with you in a minute
Thirty minutes later :
him #3 : Mr Keyscher ?
me : That is me
him #3 : I am sorry sir , but we can not allow you to enter the US .
me : ?!?!
Why is that ?
him #3 : You tried to enter on your Belgian passport , but this one is not valid to enter the US .
me : Why not ?
I was in New York two weeks ago .
I fly to the US three - four times a year .
I always use my Belgian passport .
him #3 : Sorry , but the rules changed .
As of last week , Belgian passports have to be machine readable .
me : ?!?!
him #3 : They need a strip on the ID - page which is machine readable .
Yours does not have that .
me : But two weeks ago , nobody said anything about that at the New York ’s immigration office .
him #3 : Sorry , but I do not make the rules .
And they changed since last week .
We can not let you enter the US .
me : But I am on a diplomatic mission .
I have a diplomatic status .
You have my diplomatic passports .
him #3 : Sorry , but that does not matter .
Just last week , we stopped a foreign minister from a Middle Eastern country entering the US also .
Not the right paperwork neither .
me : Is it possible to speak to your supervisor please ?
him #3 : I am the supervisor , sir .
me : Can I still speak to your superior , please ?
him #3 : I will call him on the phone .
One moment please .
After fifteen minutes with his supervisor on the phone :
him #3 : I am sorry .
But we can not let you enter the US .
I will call the British Airways representative , and see if you can get a seat back on the same plane you came in with .
me : You do understand that I flew for three days for this meeting , straight out of Iraq ?
Is there any way anyone could vouch for me ?
I can call the UN head office in New York ?
him #3 : No , sir , I am sorry , that decision is final .
me : Can I call someone to let them know I can not make it to my meeting ?
After all , twenty people will attend , and I was to chair that meeting .
him #3 : Sure , here is a phone .
But you can are only allowed one local phone call .
me : Can I use my mobile phone to call ?
The person I need to talk to is from our HQ in Rome .
He has an Italian mobile number .
him #3 : Sorry , you are not allowed to use your mobile phone here .
I try to call Gianluca in his hotel downtown Washington , but there is no response .
me : ( sigh ) So , what will happen now ?
him #3 : We will need to take your photograph and finger prints , sir .
me : ?!?!
Four mug shots , ten finger prints and thirty minutes later :
me : Can I use the bathroom , please ?
him #2 ( again ) : Sure .
An armed guard escorts me to a bathroom .
Stays outside of the door .
I take out my mobile phone , call Gianluca , and explain what happened .
I whisper I will not make it to the meeting .
I give him a 60 seconds briefing on what my message was going to be in that meeting .
The guard bangs on the toilet door saying “ It is time , let ’s go ” .
Back in the immigration screening office , the British Airways representative is talking to him #2 .
she : I picked up his luggage , but we have a pretty full plane
him #2 : …
me : What would happen if I can not get on this return flight ?
him #2 : We will have to detain you until you can get a return flight .
You have a ticket for tomorrow , so I guess that would mean detention until tomorrow .
me : ?!
Detention ?
him #2 : Yes .
she : I will do my best .
him #2 : Can I have your tickets please ?
him # 2 puts my three passports and all travel papers in a sealed envelop .
Thirty minutes later , the BA representative comes back .
she : I have a seat for you .
me : Thank you
him #2 : We will escort you to the plane now
me : Can I have my passports and tickets , please ?
him #2 : No .
You will get them back at Heathrow .
Do know that the next time you want to enter the US , you will not be able to enter on the visa waiver program for Belgian nationals .
You will need a visa .
Each time you enter the US , you will be taken for questioning .
Front desk immigration officers will not be allowed to let you enter .
I need you to sign a paper stating you understood that , and agree to it .
me : Do I have a choice ?
him :
No sir , there is no appeal for this .
me : For how long do I need to get a visa .
When will I be able to use the visa waiver program again ?
( I sign the papers )
him #2 : This is valid for ever .
Once refused entry into the US , you can not enter with the visa waiver program anymore .
This gentlemen will escort you to the plane .
Two armed men take me outside the building , onto the tarmac .
It is night already .
It rains .
A blinded truck is waiting for me .
More armed men .
I see cigarette butts on the ground , just outside of the door as we step outside .
me : I am sorry , but can I ask you one favour ?
I flew in from Cairo , non-smoking .
Four hours .
Had no time in Heathrow for a cigarette .
Then flew trans -Atlantic for six hours , spent two hours here , and now will fly again .
Can I have at least one cigarette please ?
him # 4 : ( looks at him # 5 ) OK ..
A quick one then .
me : That is the only good news I had since I landed here .
Thank you .
They escort me back onto the plain .
There are no passengers yet .
Him # 4 and him #5 whisper to the captain and the flight attendant .
They look at me .
I feel like a criminal .
Six hours later , I step out of the plane in Heathrow and get my papers back .
My flight to Dubai leaves in two hours .
I need to find a place to smoke a cigarette and call Gianluca again .
Dozens of schools are using creationist teaching materials condemned by the government as " not appropriate to support the science curriculum " , the Guardian has learned .
The packs promote the creationist alternative to Darwinian evolution called intelligent design and the group behind them said 59 schools are using the information as " a useful classroom resource " .
A teacher at one of the schools said it intended to use the DVDs to present intelligent design as an alternative to Darwinism .
Nick Cowan , head of chemistry at Bluecoat school , in Liverpool , said : " Just because it takes a negative look at Darwinism does n't mean it is not science .
I think to critique Darwinism is quite appropriate . "
But the government has made it clear that " neither intelligent design nor creationism are recognised scientific theories " .
The chairman of the parliamentary science and technology select committee , the Lib Dem MP Phil Willis , said he was horrified that the packs were being used in schools .
" I am flabbergasted that any head of science would give credence to this creationist theory and be prepared to put it alongside Darwinism , " he said .
" Treating it as an alternative centralist theory alongside Darwinism in science lessons is deeply worrying . "
The teaching pack , which includes two DVDs and a manual , was sent to the head of science at all secondary schools in the country on September 18 by the group Truth in Science .
The enclosed feedback postcard was returned by 89 schools .
As well as 59 positive responses , 15 were negative or dismissive and 15 said the material was " not suitable " .
" We are not attacking the teaching of Darwinian theory , " said Richard Buggs , a member of Truth in Science .
" We are just saying that criticisms of Darwin 's theory should also be taught . "
" Intelligent design looks at empirical evidence in the natural world and says , ' this is evidence for a designer ' .
If you go any further the argument does become religious and intelligent design does have religious implications , " added Dr Buggs .
But leading scientists argue that ID is not science because it invokes supernatural causes .
" There is just no evidence for intelligent design , it is pure religion and has nothing to do with science .
It should be banned from science classes , " said Lewis Wolpert , a developmental biologist at the University of London and vice - president of the British Humanist Association .
The DVDs were produced in America and feature figures linked to the Discovery Institute in Seattle , a thinktank that has made concerted efforts to promote ID and insert it into high school science lessons in the US .
Last year a judge in Dover , Pennsylvania , ruled that ID could not be taught in science lessons .
" Intelligent design is a religious view , a mere relabelling of creationism , and not a scientific theory , " he wrote in his judgment .
It is not clear exactly how many schools are using the Truth in Science material , or how it is being used .
The government has made it clear the Truth in Science materials should not be used in science lessons .
In a response to the Labour MP Graham Stringer on November 1 , Jim Knight , a minister in the Department for Education and Skills , wrote : " Neither intelligent design nor creationism are recognised scientific theories and they are not included in the science curriculum . "
Andy McIntosh , a professor of thermodynamics at the University of Leeds who is on the board of Truth in Science , said : " We are just simply a group of people who have put together ... a different case . "
A variety of consumer electronics devices present problems in search of a solution .
Inconsistent user interfaces are key problem , but so is overall stability and the ability to painlessly sync with computers and networks .
Increasingly , devices store information that needs to be kept in sync , including calendar , contacts , and notes .
Others access networks for content , including media downloads and software using web browsers and specialized web services .
Nearly all of them need updates of some sort .
Other device issues deal with digital media , including cameras and music and movie playback devices .
With the DRM protecting DVDs , how do users get their movies to work on a portable player ?
How does music get from a computer to a car stereo system to a mobile device ?
Device Platform Problems
The problems PDAs and mobile phones suffer are comparable to the mess of incompatibility and complexity that plagued desktop computing in the 80's .
The problems are n't all the same , but they similarly act to limit the usability and potential of consumer electronics .
User Interface
Mobile phone manufacturers have achieved incredible physical designs , have dramatically improved upon battery life , and deliver high quality cameras and other impressive features .
However , inconsistency and complexity mute the potential of all that fancy hardware .
Over the last decade , both Palm and Microsoft have tried to solve these issues with the PalmOS and WinCE .
However , outside of the dying market for PDAs , both companies have ended up with slivers of the smartphone market , and efforts to build alternative tablet or kiosk devices have all been huge failures for both .
Stability
The reigning leader in smartphones is Symbian , which dominates the market with a share similar to the iPod 's majority share of music players .
Symbian is successful because it provides a highly reliable basic framework that can be used by various mobile phone makers to create highly customized interfaces .
Linux takes second place in smartphones using a similar strategy .
The success of Symbian and Linux in the market has not resulted in phones with brilliant interfaces , but rather simply phones that work .
The flexibility they offer manufacturers does nothing for users , who still end up with phones which provide a randomly designed user interface that bears no similarity with any other devices .
That problem was supposed to be solved by PalmOS and WinCE , both of which provide a standardized user interface .
However , unlike Symbian and Linux , PalmOS and WinCE simply do n't work .
They both frequently lock up and crash , and the very interface they intend to provide is n't that great .
PalmOS is too simple and lacking in modern functionality , while WinCE is excessively complex and clumsy , a desktop OS stuffed into a small screen .
Data Sync
These devices also need systems to connect to for content and syncing .
PDAs from Palm , or those using WinCE , have specialized software for data sync but are generally tied to a single computer .
Keeping multiple computers and devices in sync is often problematic .
Mobile phone manufacturers provide their own sync tools , which often try to sync over a network , making it too complex and expensive to be practical .
Various devices all sync using different software with unique interfaces .
Depending on the manufacturer or service providers involved , hardware functions may be crippled to protect business models .
For example , Verizon has turned off Bluetooth features on some mobile phones to force users to spend their minutes using the company 's cell network to transfer files , rather than being able to copy files directly to their PC for free .
Software Availability
Software is also an issue .
Users want to pick a phone on features , not based on what software platform it offers .
Java intended to solve that issue by running everywhere , but rivals , including Qualcomm 's BREW , have muddied the software landscape in efforts to enrich service providers by creating barriers to compatibility .
Verizon likes BREW because it offers a way to lock up the market for paid content and programming .
The result is that few phones are capable of running anything beyond a few gimmicky , overpriced games .
PalmOS and WinCE phones can run a variety of specialized applications , if crashing and phone size is n't a concern .
Media Platform Problems
In addition to the latest mobile phones , an increasing number of devices now offer to play back music and video : portable players , wireless media extenders and libraries that deliver content to televisions and home theater installations , and integrated audio and display systems for cars and aircraft .
User interface problems also factor into these devices , as does media syncing and overall stability .
The main problem for media platforms however is DRM .
If the world were as simple as was back in the 80's , we 'd still be using mix tapes in our Walkman players , our car tape decks , and in our home stereos .
Along with the digital revolution came new abilities and also new threats for commercial developers of songs and movies .
The imagined panic of the early 90's that consumers would use their new ability to liberally distribute copyright material was proven true just a few years later as the web suddenly made it simple to mass distribute perfect digital copies across the Internet instantly .
The resulting lockdown of media under various draconian DRM systems effectively killed the market for early digital audio devices such as MiniDisc and DAT .
A decade after Sony 's mistakes with excessive DRM lead to the failure of its new digital formats , Microsoft repeated the same mistakes in designing Janus , its DRM framework for digital files .
Predictably , Microsoft 's experiment in mistake duplication lead to the failure of its WMA digital media format as well .
Why DRM
Some consumers have decided the problem lies with DRM .
However , DRM is merely a tool that serves a purpose .
It has a bad reputation because most DRM efforts have gone irresponsibly overboard in destroying user rights under the guise of protecting copyright .
In reality , DRM is just a lock .
Consumers are aware of why retail stores use locks to prevent theft .
There are locks on the doors , physical locks on some merchandise , and sometimes electronic tags that trigger inventory alarms .
Everyone knows there are no locks or security systems that are impossible to outwit , but retail locks do work to block the majority of theft related loss retailers would otherwise suffer .
The theft they help to stop also prevents retailers from having to cover their losses by raising prices .
In the digital world , DRM serves the same purpose .
It can be a functional deterrent to mass theft without being an insane barrier to normal use .
When abused , DRM fails , just as it did for Sony 's MiniDisc and Microsoft 's PlaysForSure , and just as its now doing for the Zune .
When DRM is created to serve the needs of both producers and consumers , it works to create markets ; DRM creates a product that can be sold , creating demand for content that would otherwise be unavailable .
Supply and Demand
With real goods , the scarcity of a product is what makes it valuable ; it has value because of its limited supply .
If the supply increases , the price drops .
Lower prices mean there is less reason to produce it , which eventually results in a lower supply and higher prices .
The value of intellectual property is not based on the scarcity of a product , but in the scarcity of good ideas to put inside a product .
The supply and demand forces that affect production and determine value to set prices have little to do with CD blanks or MP3 files that can be infinitely duplicated at near zero cost .
There is no physical scarcity involved with digital bits that can be freely duplicated .
The value in music , movies , and other content is in the talent needed to originate , produce , and manage intellectual and artistic work .
Without DRM acting to turn content into a product that can be sold in the same manner as other physical goods , there is no market because there is no way to establish a price using supply and demand .
DRM And Markets
Chaos and uncertainly are devastating to markets ; consider trying to run a retail business during a riot without locks or any police protection .
And consider the potential for markets if currency could be freely copied .
In the US , the main role of the Secret Service is to prevent the counterfeiting of money .
Using markets to set a fair price for digital media is similarly impossible if users can artificially and illicitly inflate supply and glut the market with counterfeit copies on a whim .
Ignoring the recent grandstanding by Yahoo ! to sell a single track as an MP3 , few commercial producers are willing to offer songs and movies in a wholly unrestricted form ; its the same reason that money is printed with anti-counterfeiting features .
The musicians that do sell their work as unrestricted MP3s are in the same position as software developers who offer their work as shareware .
Unfortunately , both are rarely able to afford to live off the proceeds they get .
The less status a producer has , the more willing they are to offer their work without limitation .
Conversely , the more popular and prominent entertainers and developers become , they harder they work to actually get paid by their users .
The result is simply that major commercial producers of music , television , and movies demand DRM to protect their work from mass duplication .
Two Extremist Perspectives on DRM
Without a fair and functional system of DRM , the world would be stuck in the same struggle that prevented markets from developing through the 90's : an ideological battle between the foes of any form of DRM at all , and the equally ridiculous producers who have similarly unrealistic ideas about the value of their content and how tightly it has to be locked down .
As described in The Online Music and Movie Rental Myth , these two extremes boil down to :
• Media producers who like to delude themselves into thinking that their software , patents , music , movies , or other intellectual property is so unique that it has near infinite value and can command any price they want .
• Peanut gallery freeism fanatics who think that anything that can be duplicated at little cost effectively has no inherent value , and should be free for anyone to obtain , copy and redistribute .
Fair DRM
The very idea of " fair DRM " is no doubt considered to be an oxymoron by those who have no respect for intellectual property .
Unfortunately for them , the owners and producers of music and movies do n't care .
In fact , the market itself does n't really care , because people who do n't respect the law do n't materially participate in the economy anyway .
Trying to sell DRM to foes of intellectual property is as pointless as trying to make sure burglars pay for items they take as they flee a store .
Fortunately , most consumers are willing to pay for the things they want .
Fair DRM allows them access to the content they want in exchange for a set price that makes sense .
For DRM to work , it has to be understandably consistent , not subject to unreasonable unilateral changes , and offer fair pricing .
MiniDisc failed because its DRM prevented customers from using the system in expected and reasonable ways .
PlaysForSure failed for similar reasons , but also introduced too many options , so users had no assurance that music they bought would consistently play back , burn to CD , or continue to work past the end of the month .
A Consistent Problem
Uncertainty kills markets .
Unprotected music distribution creates uncertainty for producers .
Excessive and burdensome DRM creates uncertainty for consumers .
In fact , the common thread behind all these device problems in search of a solution boils down to consistency :
• Consistent User Interface • Consistent Stability • Consistent Data Sync • Consistent and Fair DRM
It just so happens that consistency is Apple 's core competency , and the platform Apple is building will extend consistency throughout digital devices the same way the Macintosh solved the problems of inconsistency in early computing .
The next segment will explain how .

Susanna Holt , PhD , has developed the Satiety Index , a system to measure different foods ' ability to satisfy hunger .
A fixed amount ( 240 calories ) of different foods was fed to participants who then ranked their feelings of hunger every fifteen minutes and were allowed to eat freely for the next two hours .
Of all the foods tested , potatoes were the most satisfying .
How full did that meal you just ate make you feel ?
Did it satisfy your hunger , or did it make you feel like you 'll need a snack later ?
Now a new tool is available to measure the hunger fighting power of certain foods and help with blood sugar control .
Studies by Australian researcher Dr. Susanna Holt and her associates at the University of Sydney have developed one of the most exciting diet concepts ever .
Called , the " Satiety Index , " Holt 's tool ranks different foods on their ability to satisfy hunger .
Holt drew up the Satiety Index by feeding 240 - calorie portions of 38 different foods to volunteers .
The foods were served from under a hood to minimize the influence of appearance , and , if possible , they were served at the same temperature and in the same size chunks .
After eating , the volunteers told the scientists what their appetite ratings were , but they were not allowed anything else for the next two hours .
Then , after two hours , they were then allowed to eat from a small buffet , where the scientists measured how much they nibbled from a variety of other foods .
Their consumption was closely monitored , and every 15 minutes they were questioned about their hunger to see if their subjective impression of satisfaction matched their eating behavior .
Using white bread as the baseline of 100 , 38 different foods were ranked .
In other words , foods scoring higher than 100 are more satisfying than white bread and those under 100 are less satisfying .
What Really Satisfies ?
Holt found that some foods , like croissants , are only half as satisfying as white bread , while boiled potatoes are more than three times as satisfying , easily the most satisfying food tested .
But potatoes in a different form — French fries — did not score well .
This type of information can have important implications for those wanting to lose weight .
The chemical components of a food is one of the factors that determines how it ranks on the index .
" Beans and lentils , for example , contain anti-nutrients which delay their absorption so they make you feel full for longer , " says Holt .
" Roughly speaking , the more fiber , protein and water a food contains , the longer it will satisfy .
But you have to look at each foodstuff individually — and that is why we think our index will be so useful . "
Another thing that makes a food satisfying is its sheer bulk .
" You can eat an awful lot of popcorn without taking in a lot of calories , " says Holt .
" It may not weigh much , but it makes your stomach feel full just because it takes up so much space .
Oranges come out very high on the index for the same reason — but orange juice probably would n't , even though it has the same number of calories . "
It is , in fact , the size , bulk and blandness of potatoes that may account for much of its high satiety .
Their " portion weight was up to four times greater than the other foods [ for the same caloric content ] , " Holt and her co-authors note in a paper published in the December 1996 issue of the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition .
As a group , fruits ranked at the top with a satiety index 1.7 times more satisfying , on average , than white bread .
Carbohydrate - rich foods and protein - rich foods deter nibbling almost as well .
Holt warns , however , that there are big differences between the satisfaction values of individual foods within the same group .
" You ca n't just say that vegetables are satisfying or that bakery products are n't , because there can be a two - fold difference between two similar foods , " says Holt .
" We found that bananas are much less satisfying than oranges or apples , and that wholemeal bread is half again as satisfying as white bread [ 157 compared to 100 respectively ] . "
This too can be valuable information to the weight conscious .
" A diet which simply recommends cereal for breakfast overlooks the fact that muesli is only half as satisfying as porridge [ oatmeal ] , " she adds .
Some Surprises
In general , the more satisfying a food felt , the more effective it proved as a nibbling deterrent .
But even here there were some surprises .
" Fatty foods are not satisfying , even though people expected them to be , " says Holt .
" We think the reason is that fat is seen by the body as a fuel which should be used only in emergencies — it stores it in the cells instead of breaking it down for immediate use .
Because it does n't recognize the fat as energy for immediate use , the body does not tell the brain to cut hunger signals , so we go on wanting more .
Carbohydrates are the opposite — they raise blood glucose so the body knows it has gotten enough fuel . "
Jellybeans also scored higher than expected .
Volunteers fed jellybeans did not feel satisfied , yet they ate very little afterwards .
This resulted in the sweets getting a satiety rating of 118 — higher than that of muesli and yogurt and almost the same as white pasta .
" I suspect the reason that the jellybeans came out so well was that they made our volunteers feel slightly nauseous , " says Holt .
" We 'll be doing some research on that one — if we can persuade people to act as volunteers ! "
A Few Words of Advice
Holt is concerned that there may be some confusion in the interpretation of her study 's findings .
" The Satiety Index scores reflect the total amount of fullness produced by the set portions of the test foods over two hours — i.e. short - term satiety .
Although most foods with high Satiety Index scores kept fullness relatively high for the whole two hours , there were a few exceptions , " Holt notes .
" The fruits were served in very large portions , but fullness dropped off quickly towards the end of the second hour , reflecting the rapid rate of gastric emptying ( oranges and apples and grapes are mainly sugar and water ) , " she adds .
" Many ' health - conscious ' dieters , " she continues , " will eat a meal based on several pieces of fruit and some rice cakes ( in Australia anyway ) and then wonder why they feel ravenous a few hours later .
These kinds of extremely low - fat , high - carb meals do not keep hunger at bay because they are not based on slowly - digested carbs and probably do n't contain enough protein .
A dieter would be better off eating a wholesome salad sandwich on wholegrain bread with some lean protein like tuna or beef and an apple .
This kind of meal can keep hunger at bay for a very long time . "
What About Sugar - free Drinks ?
Does drinking sugar - free beverages rather than those loaded with sugar help you cut down on the total amount of calories you take in during a typical day ?
Or do they just make you hungrier ?
The answer , surprisingly , is neither .
Researchers at the University of Sydney in Australia compared the effects of equal volumes of sugar - rich and sugar - free beverages on feelings of hunger and fullness and the free consumption of a palatable , fat - rich snack .
Eleven healthy men drank equal amounts of sugar - rich cola , sugar - free cola , and mineral water in random order on separate mornings .
Then , 20 minutes later they could snack on all the potato crisps they wanted for the next hour and one - half .
Then they got a buffet - style lunch .
All the while the researchers covertly recorded what the men ate , and at the end of the day they completed a weighed food diary .
Each drink initially decreased hunger to a similar degree .
The potato crisp intake was not significantly different for the three drinks .
The amount of calories in the crisps and lunch were also not significantly different .
" By the end of the day , total energy intakes were similar for the three test conditions , " they concluded .
" Therefore , the low - calorie / low - sugar drinks did not facilitate a reduced energy intake by the lean , non-dieting male subjects . "
The Work Continues
Holt now works as a research scientist with the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization ( CSIRO ) , Australia 's largest scientific research agency , and is continuing to develop the satiety index .
" We 've just done a short study comparing the satisfying power of different breakfasts , " she writes of her , as yet , unpublished work .
" Two high - fat breakfasts of fried eggs and bacon and toast or croissants and jam were much less filling than two equal - calorie high - carb breakfasts which were either rapidly - digested ( cornflakes with sugar and toast and jam ) or slowly - digested ( All - Bran with banana slices , toast and margarine ) , " she adds .
Holt is also interested in how foods affect mood and alertness .
" The two high - carb breakfasts tended to improve alertness to a greater extent than the two high - fat breakfasts .
Also , because the subjects were not completely satisfied by the two high - fat meals , they tended to be grumpy and a bit more aggressive / disappointed . "
Additional studies of satiety among children are also being planned .
Clearly , future research is warranted and Holt hopes to do it .
Eventually tables showing the ratio of satiety to energy will be developed as a tool in planning diets for weight loss or gain .
This way we can minimize our hunger pangs and make it easier to stay on our diet programs .
The Satiety Index Each of the following foods is rated by how much food people ate after consuming them to satisfy their hunger .
All are compared to white bread , ranked as " 100 " Bakery Products Carbohydrate - Rich Foods Croissant 47 %
White bread 100 % Cake 65 % French fries 116 % Doughnuts 68 % White pasta 119 % Cookies 120 % Brown Rice 132 % Crackers 127 %
White rice 138 % Snacks and Confectionary Grain bread 154 % Mars candy bar 70 % Wholemeal bread 157 % Peanuts 84 % Brown pasta 188 % Yogurt 88 % Potatoes , boiled 323 % Crisps 91 % Protein - Rich Foods Ice cream 96 % Lentils 133 % Jellybeans 118 % Cheese 146 % Popcorn 154 % Eggs 150 % Breakfast Cereals with Milk Baked beans 168 % Muesli 100 % Beef 176 % Sustain 112 % Ling fish 225 % Special K 116 % Fruits Cornflakes 118 % Bananas 118 % Honeysmacks 132 % Grapes 162 % All - Bran 151 % Apples 197 % Porridge / Oatmeal 209 % Oranges 202 %

Update NutritionData.com has just published on that site a self - directed diet that uses what it calls the " Fullness Factor " at http://www.nutritiondata.com/fullness-factor.html.
Ron Johnson , who together with his wife , Lori , developed NutritionData.com , explains the Fullness Factor concept in email to me , part of which I except below because it clarifies what they publish on the website : Volumetrics ) to help establish additional data points or constraints , which were then used to create the current FF formula .
Sue Holt 's study played an important role in the Fullness Factor concept , because it 's the only published study ( to our knowledge ) that provides quantitative observations of satiety along with nutrient composition for a reasonably wide variety of foods .
Modeling this data set alone , however , proved to be problematic , as it is still limited in number and does n't represent the full range of foods that humans consume .
We consulted many other studies and published observations ( such as Barbara Rolls 's ) to help establish additional data points or constraints , which were then used to create the current FF formula .
There are at least three criticisms of the Fullness Factor that we readily acknowledge :
The formula does n't take into account all known contributing factors for satiety .
The formula is derived from a small data set .
The data set is based on subjectively reported , rather than directly measured , criteria .
The Fullness Factor is our first pass in establishing the concept that the satiating effect of a food can be reasonably well predicted from commonly available nutrient values .
We have not published a book or tried to sell this concept .
We are merely giving our web visitors free access to FF calculating tools to allow their own experimentation .
Our site sees approximately 500,000 visitors per month , which undoubtedly includes some obesity researchers .
Hopefully the presentation of our ideas will encourage additional studies that will allow this concept and formula to be further improved .
I have a great deal of respect for the amount of GI research that Jennie Brand - Miller has done .
I believe that GI and GL are invaluable markers for carbohydrate evaluation .
As a scientist and athlete , I 've used GI values to help guide my own dietary decisions for more than 10 years .
However , the general public ( or at least the general American public ) has tried to take GI beyond its original premise .
In our opinion , it 's not a complete enough indicator to be the entire basis for a diet .
Of course , neither is / was the whole “ low carb ” idea .
Our goal is to create or help create a simpler way for the average person ( who may not even understand what a carbohydrate is ) to evaluate foods .
FF is not the complete answer , but we believe it's at least an improvement over simple caloric density .
And when we combine FF with our nutrient - density - based Rating , as we do on our Nutritional Target Map ( described on http://www.nutritiondata.com/better-choices-diet.html), the resulting food recommendations fall fairly well in line with most respected dietary plans ( i.e. , higher reliance on fresh fruits , vegetables , fish , and lean meats ; lower reliance on sugars , fats , and processed foods ) .
Our calculations may never replace a knowledgeable dietician , but we hope they help bridge the gap for those without access to that knowledge and assistance .

The Satiety Index Elsewhere on the Internet :
" Diet Tips — The Satiety Index , " reports on studies by researchers at the University of Sydney in Australia for National Bodybuilding & Fitness zine .
The article says in part , " Food weight appears to be the determining factor .
A portion of food that weighs more than another portion of food of equal caloric value is more satisfying .
For example , boiled potatoes rated very high on the index , foods like hard candy ( high sugar foods ) , or candy bars rated very low .
Extremely high fat foods like cheesecake also rated badly , however some foods with moderate amounts of fat , such as lean steak , rate fairly well ....
A quick way to determine weather a food would have a high satiety index or not is to look it up in your calorie book and compare the calories to the portion size .
If a 4 ounce portion of food ( about 120 g. ) , has over 250 calories — avoid it . "
http://nbaf.com/nbaf/se6pgc.htm#a
" Weighing in the fullness factor , " the Web site of the Toronto Vegetarian Association , quotes an article in Spectrum , July - August , 1996 , page 5 .
The article says in part , " According to their investigation , the most satisfying foods were high in fibre .
These included such items as whole grain products , potatoes and fruits .
Foods high in fat were the least filling .
Ironically , the tastiest foods — those high in sugar and fat , like sweet bakery products — were the least satiating .
That 's because volunteers reached their caloric limit for these foods before they 'd eaten enough to feel satisfied .
In real life , there may not be a scientist looking over our shoulder to prevent us from going overboard on calories , so the tendency is to eat until satisfied , and pay the price in being overweight . "

The report where I first read about the satiety index , " Carbohydrates in Human Nutrition ; Interim Report of a Joint FAO / WHO Expert Consultation , Rome , Italy , 14 to 18 April 1997 , " says in part : " Two indices of carbohydrate foods based on their physiologic functions have been proposed .
A recently suggested satiety index [ citing reference 53 , which is Holt , S.H.A. , J.C. Brand Miller and P. Petocz .

Interrelationships among postprandial satiety , glucose and insulin responses and changes in subsequent food intake .
Eur. J. Clin. Nutr.,50:788-797 ] measures the satiety value of equal energy portions of foods relative to a standard , which is white bread .
The factors which control food intake are complex and satiety needs to be distinguished from satiation .
Nevertheless , investigation of satiety indices of foods is considered an interesting area of future research , which , if validated , may aid in the selection of appropriate carbohydrate foods to promote energy balance .
A more established index is the glycemic index which can be used to classify foods based on their blood glucose raising potential . "

At Blogs For Bush , which bills itself as the Whorehouse ... er , " White House " of the Blogosphere , the ever effervescent Mark Noonan writes about the DeLay indictment :
As our Sister Toldjah noted earlier , the " indictment " of Tom Delay is entirely bogus - from what I 've read , Tom Delay did n't know about the perfectly legal transaction he is accused of conspiring to make .
We have now left entirely the field of normal political conflict and entered a twilight world where fantasy is presented as fact and the only standard of conduct is " will it work ? " .
This is not the actions of a political Party engaged in seeking a majority - it is the action of a Party determined to destroy its opponents entirely and sieze all power for itself ... it is , in short , the stuff from which civil wars are made . [...]
I really do urge our Democrats to step back from the edge - you are sitting in a lake of gasoline and you are playing with fire .
We on our side will only put up with so much before we start to pay back with usury what we have received .
If you can't defeat Tom Delay in the electoral field , then you will simply have to accept him as Majority Leader of the United States House of Representatives - and you 'd better start accepting political reality before things get really bad .
Mark ... may I call you Mark ?
I feel when someone has shown me the insides of their own rectum , we 're pretty much on a first name basis ...
I have some words for you .
Whitewater .
Rush Limbaugh .
" Drug Dealer " Bill Clinton .
Swift Boats .
Vince Fucking Foster .
Playing with fire , you say ?
Because the indictments ringing Tom DeLay finally reached up that one , final step from his ring of closest advisers to DeLay himself ?
Because the SEC has launched a formal investigation into the same behaviors by Bill Frist that put Martha Stewart recently in prison ?
Because one of the single most visible , highest profile Republican money men has been indicted for fraud , is being investigated for client shakedowns , and has his close business associates being investigated for a mob-connected murder ?
What utter cowardice .
What pathetic anti-American pedantry .
What laughable protestation .
The crimes of campaign money laundering , of fraud , of conspiracy , the violation of the laws of the nation , to be answered with stern visions of potential gunfire if Democrats have the audacity to pursue it .
This is the world of the Republican Party , split open like a rotting pumpkin .
Crime after crime after crime being investigated , all revolving around the Republican money machine .
Every seed connected by the strands of money they share between them .
Barely - laundered campaign money passed in the palm of every flabby handshake .
Every player in boldface , underlined print in the Rolodex of every other .
And still , this same bottom - tier world of flag - waving supporters still obsessed over an extramarital sex act , but offended to the point of sad , blustering threats at the notion that crimes by gilded and worshipped Republicans are really still crimes .
Your party has set aflame the entire political landscape , and now , once burned , you warn sternly from the branches of a burnt - out tree about " playing with fire " .
You used the ashes of one of the great liberal cities of America , New York City , as war paint for your own sick , racist dreams .
You shudder at a burning flag , yet are willing to snip - and - cut basic tenets of the Constitution as needed or convenient .
And now , you 're outraged , not by any of the rest of it , not by anything that has come before , but because a few prominent Republican faces have -- shock of shocks -- been indicted in probes that have spanned years of investigation , and interrogation , and deposition .
That , you say , represents the underpinnings of a civil war .
You poor , hollow , blood - painted clowns .
Cheering the trials and failures of your country with the same pennants and giant foam hands that you wave at your favorite sports teams .
Willing to accept the most outrageous of lies , if they are spoken from your favorite talking heads , and soothe your own notions of America for you , and only for you .
And as for the audacity of Democrats speaking up during this process ... the redfaced , flatulent fury with which you declare Republicans off - limits to that which you so gleefully hurl yourself ...
Welcome to the world of the politics of personal destruction , you tubthumping , chin-jutting , Bush humping gits .
Welcome to the nasty and partisan world that Rush Limbaugh , Ann Coulter , Michelle Malkin , Hugh Hewitt , Grover Norquist , Newt Gingrich , Tom DeLay , and a legion of insignificant lowest - rung toadies like yourselves nurtured into fruition daily with eager , grubby hands , and now look upon with dull - faced faux horror .
I know you hate me , and anyone else who dares disturb the thin strands of alternate reality in which George W. Bush is an intellectual giant , Saddam really was responsible for 9/11 , the economy is getting better by the minute , and we capture the most very important members of al Qaeda on a weekly basis .
But here 's some advice .
You 'd better start hating me more .
This is the world you forged and , unfortunately for you , I 'm beginning to take a fancy for it .
Welcome to the politics of your own party , finally sprouting from the ground on which you planted the seeds and shat upon them .
Step back from the edge ?
You poor boy , asleep in the back of the car the whole trip , finally waking up and wondering where you 're at .
Swift boats .
Aluminum tubes .
Niger uranium .
" Mushroom clouds " .
Whitewater .
Vince Fucking Foster .
You can't even see the edge from here .
You left it behind a hundred miles back .
So do n't give me chest - thumping crap about civil wars , if your politicians are indicted .
Do n't give me visions of a lake of fire , if all those who find you loathsome refuse to suck at your teats of scientific ignorance in the name of religion , racism in the name of freedom , and corruption in the name of the New World Order .
Get used to the world you have created , and the stench your worshipped heroes have unleashed .

これはネットニュースの規約案だが、電子メールでも署名まで引用するのは（以下略）、というのはよくある話だよね。特に、行頭引用記号を用いないで、 "
-----Original Message ----- " という行の後に原文が丸ごとくっついてくるタイプは、自分の署名が返信者の署名に化けてしまって、大変気持ちが悪かったりする（最近、この引用部分で、署名区切り " -- " の空白を削って＝署名扱いにならない単なる " -- " に変換して＝くるのもあって、これはこれで不思議だ）。
で、Thunderbirdは、このsig-dashesで区切られた署名を見つけると、返信を作成するときにその部分を引用に含めないのだ。へぇ、こりゃ賢い。手元には同じような挙動をするものは見あたらなかったが、Sylpheedも返信用テンプレートの設定で %q を用いれば署名を引用しないようだ（追記：試してみたらOperaのメーラーでもできた）。

For Ivan Marovic , video games are serious business .
As one of the founders of the Serb student - resistance group Otpor ( " resistance " ) , Marovic helped remove former Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic from power .
Since then , he has worked with the International Center on Nonviolent Conflict , or ICNC , helping human rights activists to organize pro-democracy movements .
This year , Marovic and ICNC will add another training tool to their arsenal : a computer game called A Force More Powerful , which teaches players the strategy of nonviolent conflict .
Created by BreakAway Games , the game leads players through simulations of real - life events , such as Gandhi 's struggle for Indian independence , the civil rights movement in the American South , and Otpor 's protests in Serbia .
" Young people grew up with video games , " said Marovic , " and they take the medium seriously . "
The game does n't require an itchy trigger finger or keen hand - to - eye coordination ; rather , it relies entirely on strategy .
As well as historical recreations , players can set up their own scenarios , based on their own situation on the ground , and experiment with different nonviolent strategies .
The game 's artificial intelligence calculates the results .
" You start with just a couple of students under your control , so you plan parties and meetings , working within society to build up the strength of your group , " said BreakAway CEO Douglas
Whatley , outlining one possible game scenario .
" You have to worry about your organization , " he continued .
" Do you set up a hierarchal organization , or a cell - based one ?
Who is the best figurehead for the media ?
What kind of training do people need ?
And if you march on the capital without proper controls , things may turn violent , which will harm your cause .
These are the things people can learn . "
" You can have a ' what if ' approach , " Marovic said .
" Play the same game several times , but try different things every time .
You can't do that with books .
This interaction makes a player spend more time with a game than with a movie .
Weeks , instead of hours . "
A Force More Powerful is the follow - up to a PBS documentary on the history of nonviolent resistance that aired in 2000 .
Last year , the documentary 's producers , New York City - based York Zimmerman , asked Marovic , a self - confessed " computer geek , " to help Break Away create a game version .
The company had been overseeing the game 's development for two years prior to Marovic 's arrival .
" The idea was to use the game to transfer knowledge about nonviolent action , " said Marovic .
" The game can help more than movies and books because activists can simulate different situations and try different strategies before they try them in real life . "
Marovic sees games as a weapon of change , and so does BreakAway Games .
For the last few years , the Maryland - based developer has been a leader in what it calls " serious games . "
The company has worked closely with various arms of the Department of Defense to create military training and war - game simulations , and has also worked with health care professionals to develop Code Orange , a game that helps doctors learn to manage mass - casualty emergencies .
" The logical extension of this , " said BreakAway President Deb Tillett , " is that through our work with ICNC , we can help people change their repressive regimes . "
A Force More Powerful will initially be distributed on CD , accompanied by extensive documentation and research material on nonviolent resistance .
ICNC 's aim is to sell the title to gamers in the United States , but distribute it free to international groups .
" Every group thinks that it is the one that needs freedom the most , and that their country is most in need of a pro-democracy movement , " said Marovic .
" The good thing about this game is that it can reach all of them at the same time , even if trainers like me can't . "

Big news :
The court said the men , who are accused of having ties to al - Qaeda , have the right to see and respond to evidence against them .
It pointed to a law in Britain that allows special advocates or lawyers to see sensitive intelligence material , but not share details with their clients .
In its ruling , the court said while it ’s important to protect Canada ’s national security , the government can do more to protect individual rights .
But the court suspended the judgment from taking legal effect for a year , giving Parliament time to write a new law complying with constitutional principles .
Critics have long denounced the certificates , which can lead to deportation of non-citizens on the basis of secret intelligence presented to a Federal Court judge at closed - door hearings .
Those who fight the allegations can spend years in jail while the case works its way through the legal system .
In the end , they can sometimes face removal to countries with a track record of torture , say critics .
UPDATE : As Atrios notes , if Harriet Miers would just start blogging again , we could get to the bottom of this pronto .
He 's not resigning , what a surprise .
He accepts responsibility for the mistakes that " we 're made . "
Oh my , now he 's playing the race card .
He 's overcome a lot of obstacles in his life to become attorney general - sounds like the race card to me .
Which is funny coming from an administration that attacks Latinos every change it gets .
I 'd like to see him overcome a perjury charge .
LOL
He saying that DOJ is a really big organization and he's not aware of everything that goes on .
So much for him accepting responsibility .
It was his freaking chief of staff , and the president of the United States , who were involved in this - and he did n't know about it ?
Oooh , he 's now saying that he 's dismayed that he may not have given the congress accurate information .
UNDER OATH , I might add .
Now we know why he 's doing the presser .
Oh here were go again , we have 110,000 people here at DOJ , and he just can't know everything .
So I guess he was just lying when he went before congress and under oath said he knew definitively that this entire affair was n't political .
Or did Gonzales only JUST discover that there are 110,000 people at DOJ and he does n't know everything that goes on - you know , so he was n't lying to the congress under oath because he thought he did know everything that goes on with all 110,000 people ?
Ooh , now he 's outright blaming his now - ex chief of staff , and he 's stumbling a bit , stuttering , etc .
Someone is nervous .
I never saw documents , we never had a discussion .
But he 's accepting responsibility , even though he 's totally innocent .
Oh man , that was fascinating .
The man is n't just trying to keep his job , he 's trying to avoid going to jail .
CNN : " He comes out really strong , ' I take responsibility for all the mistakes , mistakes were made and I take responsibility for them , but I did n't know about them . '
It sounds like he 's taking responsibility , and then not so . "
Macworld 2007 is just days away .
Here 's a look at what 's likely to be revealed , some promising ideas that are less likely to get delivered , and things that have no chance of happening .
Part two covers the Mac family .
Part 2 : Macs and MacBooks
While Macworld covers other Apple products , it largely directs attention to the Mac .
Last year ’s Macworld introduced the new Intel based iMac Core Duo and previewed the new MacBook Pro .
Over the last half decade however , Apple has only released one or two new or revised Mac hardware lines at each Macworld event :
• Macworld 2000 - G4 Cube • Macworld 2001 - Titanium PowerBook • Macworld 2002 - Flat panel iMac G4 , 14 ” iBook • Macworld 2003 - 12 ” and 17 ” PowerBooks • Macworld 2004 - Xserve G5 • Macworld 2005 - Mac Mini
Anyone hoping for Apple to release “ an all new everything ” this year will be disappointed , just as legions of bloggers announce every year in a united chorus of “ that ’s it ? ” after hearing that the year ’s Macworld will be much the same as every other Macworld before it .
Ultralight Rumors
This year ’s unsubstantiated rumors for Mac hardware include a 12 ” MacBook , a product Apple announced it would not build .
There is a market for ultralight laptops , but it is n’t clear how Apple could capitalize on that market .
The reason is that ultralight laptops are inherently fragile , and being super light and thin also necessitates being more expensive with fewer features , or fully featured at a ridiculous price .
Expensive products with limited appeal are not what Apple ’s been building , nor are they easy to sell in Apple ’s retail stores or to education .
Apple ’s products are all designed to perfectly hit 80 % of the market .
To do that , the company forgoes the ultra cheap and ultra high end .
Apple wo n’t be shipping sub $ 500 Macs , nor is it likely that the company will try to sell $ 4000 ultralights .
It ’s simply a difficult product to target because ultralight buyers are notoriously fickle .
Existing competitors already have loyal customers , simply because ultralight laptops are not a mass market product with broad common appeal .
Some focus on being light and thin with a slow CPU and no CD , others ship loaded with features and a painful price tag .
Who would Apple target ?
Speed Bumps
Intel Xserves and Mac Pros were just announced in the second half of 2006 , making it unlikely Apple would need to say anything about them , although Adobe CS3 will likely be trotted out as the reason to buy a new Mac Pro .
The rest of Apple ’s lineup , from MacBooks and MacBook Pros to the iMac and Mac mini are all relatively fresh , leaving little room for any exciting updates .
The star of Macworld may be the half - sized companion to the Mac mini : the iTV , or as I like to call it , the Airport AV .
Earlier events have all tried to add excitement to Apple ’s hardware lineup or expand into new product categories .
This year , there is n’t a huge void demanding a new Mac however .
• Macworld 2000 The G4 Cube attempted to deliver a new personal workstation .
• Macworld 2001
The Titanium PowerBook created new sizzle in the tired laptop line .
• Macworld 2002
Flat panel iMac G4 resurrected the languishing iMac series .
• Macworld 2003 12 ” and 17 ” PowerBooks revitalized and expanded Apple ’s laptops .
• Macworld 2004 Xserve G5 renewed the server line .
• Macworld 2005 Mac Mini created a new category between PowerMacs and iMacs. • Macworld 2006
Launched the new Intel lineup , now complete .
New Tricks For Existing Macs
More interesting than new hardware will be new applications .
The iTV will launch a major new initiative in connecting the home computer with home theater , iTunes , iLife , and gaming .
Of course Leopard will also be a key star , and if the planets align as expected , Apple will announce the launch of the iPod Phone , and how it will link the iPod , iPhone , iTV platform all together .
For Macs , that just leaves speed bumps and reports on how Mac sales are going .
Last summer , I estimated Mac sales increasing toward 2010 to get an idea of how long PowerPC Macs would stick around .
Sales Estimates
2009 5,250,000
2008 5,000,000
2007 4,800,000
2006 4,600,000
Actual numbers
2005 4,534,000
2004 3,290,000
2003 3,012,000
Since the dotcom crash in 2001 , Mac sales have languished at around 800,000 per quarter .
In 2005 , sales jumped above a million per quarter , peaking out at 1.2 million during the fourth quarter .
They did n’t drop back down , either .
The line graph above shows actual sales numbers , not my estimates .
In the middle of this year , Mac sales surged to a 1.6 million Mac quarter , leaving my fiscal year 2006 estimate low by nearly a million : 5,303,000 vs. 4,600,000 .
That ’s more Macs than Apple sold in the 2000 tech bubble , and more than I expected Apple to sell in any year within this decade .
It also does n’t count this winter quarter ’s sales , which is Apple ’s fiscal Q1 2007 .
Installed Base
For this winter quarter , Mac sales will approach 2 million !
That ’s good news for anyone who buys Mac software , as it means a dramatic lift in demand for new software development .
Consider installed base figures .
At Macworld 2006 , there was an installed base of 13.9 million recent Macs -- less than four years old -- and all were PowerPC .
This year , there are over 16 million recent Macs , and nearly a third are Intel based .
Next year , there will be close to 20 million Macs , and more than half will be Intel based .
That ’s a huge increase , and it ’s being driven by factors that are not going away .
The rosy glow of the iPod , combined with Apple ’s retail efforts and the new features of Intel Macs make the Mac platform broadly appealing , particularly when compared to the same old PC offerings .
That means more new Mac development both from Apple and third parties .
The next article will look at Macworld 2007 on the software front .
Macworld Scorecard : Macs and MacBooks
Likely to be revealed
• Boring hardware updates • Mac Pros demonstrating Creative Suite 3 • Mac minis paired with the iTV • Impressive sales reports
Promising ideas that are less likely to get delivered
• Ultralight pro laptop
No chance of happening
• Origami Mac tablet running Mac OS X CE

U.S. Government Contractor Injects Malicious Software into Critical Military Computers
This is just a frightening story .
Basically , a contractor with a top secret security clearance was able to inject malicious code and sabotage computers used to track Navy submarines .
Yeah , it was annoying to find and fix the problem , but hang on .
How is it possible for a single disgruntled idiot to damage a multi-billion - dollar weapons system ?
Why are n’t there any security systems in place to prevent this ?
I ’ll bet anything that there was absolutely no control or review over who put what code in where .
I ’ll bet that if this guy had been just a little bit cleverer , he could have done a whole lot more damage without ever getting caught .
One of the ways to deal with the problem of trusted individuals is by making sure they ’re trustworthy .
The clearance process is supposed to handle that .
But given the enormous damage that a single person can do here , it makes a lot of sense to add a second security mechanism : limiting the degree to which each individual must be trusted .
A decent system of code reviews , or change auditing , would go a long way to reduce the risk of this sort of thing .
I ’ll also bet you anything that Microsoft has more security around its critical code than the U.S. military does .

If you are an investor in one of the many U.S. - listed technology outsourcing giants such as Infosys , then I have some bad news for you : they are no longer the cherished destination for the brightest and the smartest in India .
Instead , they are being viewed derisively as “ code factories . ”
What gives ?
Read on …
One of the most amazing things you notice about Indian newspapers recently is the lack of technology headlines .
Instead the focus is on telecom and manufacturing and organized retail .
This is in sharp contrast from a few years ago , when I encountered newspapers proudly chronicling the tech outsourcing boom while visiting the city of my birth .
A few reports today in the local media , when taken together , seem to be like the proverbial dark cloud hanging over the Indian technology sector that sparked off the local economic boom .
The Hindustan Times reports that an increasing number of employees who work for business process outsourcers ( BPOs ) are leaving their jobs and heading to the business schools .
Nearly 10 - to - 12 % of new management students came from the BPO industry .
The grueling hours and hard life with few prospects to rise to the managerial ranks are the main reason why many are looking to upgrade their professional lives .
The Times of India today is running a piece called the Myth of The Indian Programmer , which has some pretty startling revelations .
Apparently , last year only 10 of the 574 graduates of IIT Powai joined the tech outsourcers , with a majority opting for the likes of Google .
The article argues that a lot of churn at companies like Infosys is a result of dissatisfaction with being just coders and engineers are switching to jobs with bigger challenges .
A Tata Consultancy Services ( TCS ) executive acknowledges that the outlook is gloomy .
The question then is that if the top outsourcers cannot attract the best and the brightest , then how are they going to stay competitive ?
The third piece , again in the Times of India , points out that the IIT system is facing a resource crunch , which could mean even the brightest minds may not be able to get the resources they need to become world - beaters .
Maybe I am being pessimistic , overcome with the idea of a 22 - hour journey and leaving my family , but something tells me that my pessimism may not be completely unfounded .
If you are a professional from the “ outsourcing ” business , please let me know how you feel about your business , and give us your outlook .

NetBSD now scales better than even FreeBSD 5 !
FreeBSD 4.9 benchmarked as well .
While some aspects may be more well - tuned , FreeBSD 5.1 scales better .
Introduction
These benchmarks are the result of my scalable network programming research .
My interest in this area is to see how scalable and fast network applications can be on standard PC hardware .
I have done most of my research on Linux 2.4 , 2.5 and 2.6 kernels using a home - grown distribution I affectionately call " Leanux " .
I have experimented with several APIs and methods to try and get the most scalability and performance out of a web server .
The ultimate goal , however , is to demonstrate scalability by surviving a Slashdotting .
Please note that most of the sites succumb not only because of bad software but also because of their internet connectivity being saturated .
Besides choosing an ISP with small bandwidth costs , there is only so much I can do about this .
I hope this ISP can handle the load .
During my research I experimented with several APIs on what abstraction to choose for the different scalable event notification mechanisms .
In the end , I settled on Dan Bernstein 's IO library interface , which I slightly extended to include an abstraction around writev and sendfile .
When my implementation worked on Linux , I decided to port the API to BSD as well , to finally get some real benchmark data into the eternal flamewar on which IP stack scales best .
To that end , I installed FreeBSD , OpenBSD and NetBSD on my notebook , so all benchmarks would run on the same hardware .
Benchmarking BSD and Linux
About the hardware
The benchmark hardware is a Dell Inspiron 8000 with a 900 MHz Pentium 3 and 256 MB RAM .
The network chip is a MiniPCI Intel eepro100 card , which is supported and well tuned on all operating systems .
Since my intention is to benchmark the software and not the hardware , I did n't care that it was only a single , slow CPU with slow memory and a slow IDE hard disk .
Real server machines built for high scalability will probably use more powerful hardware than this .
Common settings
On all of the operating systems , I took the default settings .
If I had to turn a knob to get PCI IDE DMA enabled , I did so .
If the OS had power management support , I did not disable that .
I enabled ( and used ) IP v6 support on all operating systems .
Linux 2.4
I benchmarked a stock Linux 2.4.22 kernel .
Linux 2.6
I benchmarked a stock Linux 2.6.0 - test7 kernel .
OpenBSD 3.4
I benchmarked an OpenBSD 3.4 - CURRENT .
I directly installed - CURRENT to get patched up openssl and openssh versions .
The first OpenBSD installation was wasted because the stupid boot loader ( after installing everything ) did not want to boot from the partition , apparently because it is beyond cylinder 1024 .
In my opinion , this is absolutely unexcusable for a modern operating system in the year 2003 , and the OpenBSD people should be ashamed of themselves .
Linux and the other BSDs did not have a problem booting from high places .
I ended up reinstalling OpenBSD in the swap partition from my Linux installation .
In the end I had so little space that I had to copy the logs over to my desktop box after each benchmark , otherwise the filesystem would be full .
OpenBSD also caused a lot of grief on the IP v6 front .
The OpenBSD guys intentionally broke their IP v6 stack to not allow IP v4 connections to and from IP v6 sockets using the IPv4 mapped addresses that the IP v6 standard defines for thus purpose .
I find this behaviour of pissing on internet standards despicable and unworthy of free operating systems .
OpenBSD had lots of performance and scalability issues .
Particularly embarassing is the fact that even NetBSD outperforms it on a few benchmarks .
OpenBSD is a fork of NetBSD , so I expected it to be no worse than it 's ancestor in all key areas .
I was wrong .
[ Update Oct 22 2003 ] : While I received a lot of verbal abuse from OpenBSD users , the OpenBSD project itself is focusing on solving the issues ; the 1024 cylinder limit is apparently being worked on , and the fork panic has been reproduced and a bug has been opened in the bug tracking system .
[ Update Oct 23 2003 ] : Please see this update as well .
The OpenBSD project has several patches pending in - CURRENT to speed up bottlenecks identified in these benchmarks , so the next update will probably look much better for OpenBSD .
[ Update Nov 1 2003 ] :
To my knowledge OpenBSD still has not integrated all the patches , so I have not redone all my benchmarks .
However , Ted Unangst wrote me to explain the weird touch - after - mmap behaviour .
It turns out that OpenBSD 's buffer cache is not unified in that if you read something with read / pread and then mmap and touch it , the value is read from disk again .
OpenBSD apparently has a unified buffer cache in the works , but it is not there .
Ted suggested changing my mmap benchmark to improve the OpenBSD graph , but I think that would not be fair .
I , for once , have always used cat to put databases into the buffer cache that are later accessed by a process with random access patters ( djbdns , openldap ) .
So what my mmap benchmark actually measures on OpenBSD is the disk access time .
This is curious because I ran all the benchmarks 5 times and took the average time , and it was still zig - zag for all five , which means even if I prime the mmap cache , OpenBSD will still not cache the whole file .
I hope OpenBSD will use this benchmark as incentive to try integrating the unified buffer cache again , as it is clearly worth it .
FreeBSD 5.1
I installed a FreeBSD 5.1 - RELEASE on a free partition .
However , the kernel turned out to be unstable under load and would panic or even freeze under load .
So I reluctantly upgraded the kernel to 5.1 - CURRENT , which fixed the problems and proved to be a very stable kernel .
I also upgraded openssl and openssh on this installation .
And I amended my library to use the IPV6_V6ONLY sockopt to get proper IP v6 behaviour from FreeBSD .
Apart from the stability issues in 5.1 - RELEASE , FreeBSD turned out to be very stable and the fastest and most scalable BSD .
NetBSD 1.6.1
I installed a NetBSD 1.6.1 - RELEASE on a free partition .
The kernel was very stable and had a much snappier feeling to it than OpenBSD , which was the first BSD I tried out , and I somehow expected NetBSD to be slower than OpenBSD in every respect .
The opposite was true : in particular disk and file system performance appears to be much better in NetBSD .
Unfortunately , the IPV6_V6ONLY sockopt did not work on NetBSD .
One has to use a sysctl to get the proper IP v6 behaviour .
That is unfortunate but bearable .
Since NetBSD did not start any network services per default , I did not feel obliged to upgrade openssl and openssh .
Since the kernel was so stable , I did not feel I had to try the - CURRENT version .
In the mean time I heard that the - CURRENT version of NetBSD has over two years worth of improvements in it , so it probably is even better than NetBSD 1.6.1 , which already surprised me with its good performance ( although it is clearly outperformed by FreeBSD ) .
The socket benchmark
My first benchmark was calling socket ten thousand times .
I normally use gettimeofday for taking the time in benchmarks , but in this case the results were so close and small that I switched to reading the CPU cycle counter , which has 900 times finer resolution on my notebook , but makes the results not so easily comparable .
The task we are benchmarking here is the kernel allocating a socket data structure in kernel ( which is easy to do ) and selecting the lowest unused file descriptor ( which is not so easy ) .
On this benchmark you can see that all the operating systems scale quite well .
While there are variations , there is no O ( n ) or even worse implementation .
I find the FreeBSD graph particularly interesting , because it indicates some sort of " cheating " by suddenly being so much faster than all the others ( and itself a few sockets earlier ) .
This looks like the kernel starts pre-allocating file descriptors when a process has more than 3500 descriptors open or so .
I did n't look in the code , though , and after all there is nothing wrong with this kind of tweaking .
Conclusion : FreeBSD outperforms all other operating systems in this benchmark .
However , all contestants scale equally well , there are no clear losers .
And the overall latency in this benchmark is so low that the results are interchangeable in practice .
( Note : this initially said " NetBSD " instead of " FreeBSD " .
That was a brain fart , sorry , and thanks to Maxwell on Slashdot for pointing this out )
The bind benchmark
The second benchmark is calling bind with port 0 on each of the sockets .
This was actually done in the same benchmark program than the previous benchmark , and in the same run .
This benchmark is not important for scalable web servers , but it is important for proxy servers , FTP servers and load balancers .
Oh , and for our http benchmark program , of course .
The task we are benchmarking here is the kernel selecting an unused TCP port .
There are 65535 TCP port .
Traditionally , ports greater than 1024 are selected here , but at least on Linux this range is configurable ( / proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_local_port_range , which is set to 32768 - 61000 per default ) .
This task is actually easier than selecting the first unused file descriptor , but since it is not so important for web servers , some operating systems decided not to optimize it .
In this graph you cannot see FreeBSD and Linux 2.4 , because they are overdrawn by the Linux 2.6 graph .
All three graphs are in the same area , scaling equally well : O ( 1 ) .
The dents in the graphs for OpenBSD and NetBSD are normally a sign for a data structure becoming so big that it does not fit into the L1 cache any more ( or L2 cache ) .
You can see that NetBSD and OpenBSD scale O(n ) here , while Linux and FreeBSD scale O ( 1 ) .
Since OpenBSD has so many data points with dramatically higher latency , it is the clear loser in this benchmark .
The fork benchmark
This benchmark creates a pipe and then opens many child processes , which each write one byte into the pipe and then hang around until they are killed .
After creating each child , the benchmark waits until it can read the one byte from the new child process from the pipe and takes the time from the fork until having read the byte .
This way we measure how fast fork is implemented , and we measure the scheduler performance as well , because the scheduler 's job becomes more difficult if there are more processes .
The OpenBSD and FreeBSD graphs stop early because OpenBSD crashed when I forked more processes , and I could n't find out how to increase FreeBSD 's system limit on the number of processes ( sysctl said the value was read - only ) [ Update Oct 19 2003 : I was told that I have to put kern .
maxproc=100000 into / boot / loader.conf to do this ] .
Please note that the benchmark process was linked dynamically .
The Linux 2.4 graph is very peculiar , because it looks like two graphs .
All of the graphs in all of the benchmarks here are taken five times and I initially planned to show the average values with error margins .
The Linux 2.4 data from this benchmark were the reason I did n't ; now I just plot all the values for each of the five runs .
You might guess that the first run of the benchmark on Linux 2.4 produced the O( n ) graph and the others were O ( 1 ) , maybe because some internal data structure was continuously enlarged during the first run , but that is wrong .
Each of the five benchmark runs on Linux 2.4 alternated randomly between a point in the O ( 1 ) graph and one in the O ( n ) graph .
I have no explanation for this .
The clear winner in the graph is Linux 2.6 .
OpenBSD does not scale at all , and even panics under high load .
NetBSD scales O( n ) , which is respectable for the grandfather of all the BSDs , but it is not a winning performance .
Linux 2.4 shows that there is work to be done ; I give it the third place .
FreeBSD looks like it would scale O ( 1 ) if I could create more processes with it , but as long as I can't confirm it , I can only give it the second place .
The static fork benchmark
fork has more work to do when the processes are dynamically linked .
So I reran the fork benchmark with a statically linked binary , but only on FreeBSD and Linux 2.6 , the winners of the previous benchmark .
To show you the difference , I plottet the new results besides the old results in this graph .
As you can see , linking statically almost halves the fork latency on both systems .
The mmap benchmark
It is important for databases and large web and proxy servers to map files into memory instead of having a buffer and reading the file contents into the buffer .
If you map the file into memory directly , the operating system has more memory left for I /O buffering .
The Unix syscall for memory mapping files is called mmap .
The performance aspect we are benchmarking here is the efficiency of the data structures the kernel uses to manage the page tables .
Memory is managed in units of " pages " , with one page typically being 4 k .
Many architectures ( including x86 ) can to 4 MB pages as well for special occasions .
On some SPARC CPUs the page size is 8 k , on IA - 64 it can be 4 k to 16k .
The operating system needs to maintain two data structures for memory mapped files : one system wide " page table " for all the pages , because more than one process may do a shared mapping of the same page , plus one table for each process .
The process specific table is what fork copies .
This benchmark takes a 200 MB file and mmaps other second 4 k page of it into its address space .
To make sure we measure the mmap data structure and not the hard disk , the benchmark starts by reading every of those pages once , so they are in the buffer cache .
Then this benchmark takes the time it takes to mmap each page , and the time it takes to read the first byte of each page .
The point is that the operating system does not actually need to map a page into the address space when we mmap it .
Only when we access that page , the process local page table needs to get updated .
The MMU will signal an exception to the operating system as soon as the process touches the mmapped page that the OS did not actually map yet .
[ Update 20 Oct 2003 ]
I was asked what the point of this benchmark is , why I do not mmap the whole file sequentially .
The reason is that I want to simulate a web server that mmaps a lot of small files ( Apache has an mmap module that does this ) , without having to create a million small files for the benchmark .
It is easier to simulate the pressure on the mmap data structures this way .
As you can see , we have three clear losers in this benchmark : Linux 2.4 , NetBSD and FreeBSD .
The OpenBSD graph scales much better than these , but wait until you see the second part of this benchmark .
The clear winner is Linux 2.6 .
Here is a graph of Linux and FreeBSD latency for touching a page .
As you can see , Linux 2.4 appears to scale O( n ) , while Linux 2.6 is O ( 1 ) .
FreeBSD looks to be much faster than Linux 2.6 , but you need to keep in mind that FreeBSD took an extraordinary time to do the actual mmap , so this good result does not save the day for FreeBSD .
So where are the others ?
Here are the same results , but this time with NetBSD .
As you can see , NetBSD is significantly slower than Linux and FreeBSD for this benchmark , but at least it does not get much slower when more pages are mmapped .
And now the final graph , with OpenBSD :
Whoa !
Obviously , something is seriously broken in the OpenBSD memory management .
OpenBSD is so incredibly slow that compared to this performance , NetBSD looks like Warp 9 , and Linux is not even on the same chart .
Conclusion : Linux 2.6 is the clear winner , scaling O ( 1 ) in every respect .
The clear loser is OpenBSD ; I have never seen bad performance of this magnitude .
Even Windows would probably outperform OpenBSD .
NetBSD performance leaves a lot to be desired as well .
This mmap graph is the only part of the whole benchmark suite where FreeBSD did not perform top notch .
If the FreeBSD people fix this one dark spot , they will share the top space with Linux 2.6 .
[ Update : Oct 19 2003 ]
Moshe Bar just wrote me that most commercial databases do not actually use mmap but regular read and write .
And he should know , he is the maintainer of OpenMOSIX .
Fragmentation
I would like to show you one more graph , although it is not OS specific .
The next graph shows the effect of file system fragmentation and of I /O scheduling .
The red graph shows one client downloading one big CD image over a dedicated Fast Ethernet connection .
As expected , the Ethernet is completely saturated , and the throughput is 11 MB /sec sustained .
This was measured on Linux 2.6 , but all the other operating systems ( except OpenBSD ) were also able to saturate the Fast Ethernet .
OpenBSD had big performance drops in the process , adding to the previous embarassment with mmap .
I can really only warn of using OpenBSD for scalable network servers .
Anyway , the green graph shows a badly fragmented file ( I downloaded another ISO image using an old version of BitTorrent ) .
Although the IDE disk is slow , it is not that slow .
It can read a sustained 25 MB /sec linearly .
But on modern hard disks the throughput is only good as long as you do n't have to seek around on disk , which basically means that large files need to be non-fragmented .
For this fragmented file , the throughput drops to about 4 MB/sec ( which already has the positive effects of the Linux 2.6 I/O scheduler , it 's more like 1.5 MB/sec on Linux 2.4 ! ) .
Another way to get the disk head to seek around is to have two people download different large files at the same time .
The blue graph shows this : at first it also gets 11 MB / sec throughput , but as soon as someone else downloads something , the head has to move around , killing the throughput for the poor guy .
Please note that the second download was a rate limited 4 MB / sec download over the loopback interface , so what you see here was not Ethernet saturation , it was latency from the hard disk .
By the way : the blue graph downloads the same file as the red graph .
The connect latency benchmark
We are ultimately interested in the performance of HTTP requests .
There are two parts to that : the connect latency and the latency for answering the actual HTTP request .
The connect latency is the time it takes for the server to notice the connection attempt and call accept .
This time is largely dominated by the event notification .
Accepting a connection does not actually do anything besides sending a TCP packet and allocating a file descriptor .
The socket benchmark already showed that allocating a file descriptor is O ( 1 ) for each OS in the test .
So it is reasonable to expect this benchmark to show that the operating systems with special event notification APIs scale O( 1 ) ( Linux 2.4 : SIGIO , Linux 2.6 : epoll , FreeBSD + OpenBSD : kqueue ) and the rest to scale O( n ) ( NetBSD ) .
My benchmark http server is called gatling and it makes use of SIGIO , epoll and kqueue if available , but falls back to poll if not .
I omitted the graphcs for Linux and FreeBSD because they were O ( 1 ) , as expected .
As you can see , it was OpenBSD that showed the O( n ) graph , and NetBSD that has the O ( 1 ) graph here .
I am as surprised as you .
Believe me , I double and triple checked that gatling used kqueue on OpenBSD and that I had n't switched the results or graphs somehow .
The clear loser is , again , OpenBSD .
Do n't use OpenBSD for network servers .
NetBSD appears to have found some clever hack to short - circuit poll if there only are events for one of the first descriptors in the array .
Measuring HTTP request latency
This final benchmark measures how long it takes for the http server to answer a request .
This does not include the connect latency , which I showed you in the previous graph .
This graph shows that Linux 2.4 and Linux 2.6 perform equally O ( 1 ) here .
FreeBSD is a little slower for the first 4000 connections and becomes faster after that .
I am at a loss how to explain that .
The FreeBSD guys appear to have found some really clever shortcuts .
The Linux 2.4 graph is overdrawn by the Linux 2.6 graph here .
OpenBSD data points are all over the place in this graph ; again , I would advise against using OpenBSD for scalable network servers .
NetBSD is missing on this graph , but here is a graph with NetBSD :
The clear loser of this benchmark is NetBSD , because they simply do n't offer a better API than poll .
As I wrote in the introduction , I only benchmarked the stable NetBSD 1.6.1 kernel here , and I assume they have included kqueue in their - CURRENT kernel .
I will try to update my NetBSD installation and rerun the benchmarks on it .
Conclusion
Linux 2.6 scales O ( 1 ) in all benchmarks .
Words fail me on how impressive this is .
If you are using Linux 2.4 right now , switch to Linux 2.6 now !
FreeBSD 5.1 has very impressive performance and scalability .
I foolishly assumed all BSDs to play in the same league performance - wise , because they all share a lot of code and can incorporate each other 's code freely .
I was wrong .
FreeBSD has by far the best performance of the BSDs and it comes close to Linux 2.6 .
If you run another BSD on x86 , you should switch to FreeBSD !
Linux 2.4 is not too bad , but it scales badly for mmap and fork .
NetBSD 1.6.1 was treated unfairly by me because I only tested the stable version , not the unstable source tree .
I originally only wanted to benchmark stable versions , but deviated with OpenBSD and then with FreeBSD .
I should have upgraded NetBSD then , too .
Nonetheless , NetBSD feels snappy , performs well overall , although it needs work in the scalability department , judging from the old version I was using .
Please note that NetBSD was the only BSD that never crashed or panicked on me , so it gets favourable treatment for that .
OpenBSD 3.4 was a real stinker in these tests .
The installation routine sucks , the disk performance sucks , the kernel was unstable , and in the network scalability department it was even outperformed by it's father , NetBSD .
OpenBSD also gets points deducted for the sabotage they did to their IP v6 stack .
If you are using OpenBSD , you should move away now .
The Code
I used my experimental web server gatling to measure these numbers .
All the benchmark programs are also part of the gatling package .
You can download gatling via anonymous cvs from :
% cvs -d :pserver:cvs@cvs.fefe.de :/cvs -z9 co libowfat % cvs -d :pserver:cvs@cvs.fefe.de :/cvs -z9 co gatling
libowfat contains my implementation of the IO API , gatling is the webserver .
You need to build libowfat first .
If you are using Linux , also check out
% cvs -d :pserver:cvs@cvs.fefe.de :/cvs -z9 co dietlibc
Remarks
Slashdot accepted the story , and this site is being slashdotted as of Oct 19 2003 .
Here are a few answers to questions that have been raised in the Slashdot forums :
Did he disable debugging in FreeBSD 5 ?
Yes .
comparing epoll to kqueue is n't fair because Linux 2.6 is a development platform
You could say so .
On the other hand , my graphs show that SIGIO performs equally well , it 's just not so nice to use .
And since Linus has declared feature freeze a long time ago , and the kernel hackers on Linux Kongress agreed that Linux 2.6 is actually more stable than Linux 2.4 , I thought it 's OK .
And it would have been sad not to benchmark Linux 2.6 because of that .
After all , I also benchmarked FreeBSD 5.1 - CURRENT .
Why did he use FreeBSD 5 at all and not FreeBSD 4.8 ?
Because I read that they did many exciting scalability improvements in FreeBSD 5 , and that 's what this is about , after all .
FreeBSD is getting so fast under load , did he make sure the calls actually succeeded ?
Yes .
But please do n't take my word for it , download the benchmark sources ( see above ) .
All he does is bash BSD all the time
Sorry if you get that impression .
The opposite is true : I was extremely impressed with FreeBSD performance and I also found NetBSD to be quite snappy .
The 1024 cylinder boot restriction has been fixed for a while in OpenBSD
Then apparently some evil infiltrator meaning harm to the OpenBSD project sabotaged my - CURRENT download set from Oct 4 2003 .
The OpenBSD IPv6 problem is for security , not evilness
That 's what itojun has said for ages .
When I challenged him to point to even one case that demonstrated anyone was ever negatively impacted by the normal behaviour , he posted a message to bugtraq asking for people to step forward .
Nobody did .
By the way : Linux Kongress had an own talk about how to use autoconf macros to write portable IP v6 applications .
This is because the API got fragmented , which is a very bad thing , especially for something new we want people to adopt .
Like IP v6 .
Why is there no real network load ?
Because I do n't have gigabit ethernet at home .
I 'm working on it .
If you are a big hardware vendor and would like to lend me some server hardware for testing , please contact me !
Non-x86 is also welcome .
Where are the file system benchmarks ?
There are none , because this is very difficult to do in a fair way .
I am considering a few micro benchmarks here , but I have n't decided yet .
Suggestions are welcome !
Why did you not tune the kernels ?
I did some tuning ( like increasing kernel limits ) , but it was a conscious decision not to try to tune kernels , because I am not proficient enough with all the operating systems to make this fair .
Also , tuning can only reduce latency a little , it wo n't turn O ( n ) into O ( 1 ) .
In the end , I 'm not going to do any benchmarks on tuned kernels unless there is a way for me to avoid being accused of trying to make one OS look bad .
I could ask all the kernel teams to give me tuning instructions for their OS , but then I would open myself up to accusations of trying to make myself more important than I am .
Again , suggestions on how to do this properly are welcome .
OpenBSD looks slow because the disk was full !
Actually , no .
All the benchmarks are conducted in a way that preloads all the accessed portions from disk into the buffer cache , so there are no disk accesses during the benchmarks , and only in the new manymap open benchmark file system code is benchmarked at all .
For some reason , nobody asked for a Windows benchmark .
That is strange because everybody else I showed this to asked me about this .
The reason is the same as for DragonflyBSD : I do n't have more space on my hard disk .
But please , run the benchmarks yourself and send me the graphs !
The slashdotting also revealed a problem in gatling or Linux , I can't tell yet : sendfile ( although on a non-blocking socket , or so it should be ) suddenly blocks , which blocks the whole server .
I will investigate further ... ;)
By the way , if you have any grief with how and on what configurations I ran my benchmarks , please scroll up a little and download the sources .
Then run them yourself and send me a link to your results , so I can link them from here .
New Measurements
NetBSD-CURRENT
[ Oct 20 2003 ] I just upgraded my NetBSD 1.6.1 to NetBSD - CURRENT and reran the benchmarks .
The upgrade build process did not run smoothly , the NetBSD crowd will have to review that ( e.g . I got a /usr / src/usr.bin / ktrace / ktrace / directory from CVS , which the make clean run in build.sh tried to rm -f ( without - r ) , and that caused the whole build to abort ) ( sorry , it 's not kqueue , it 's ktrace as I initially wrote ) .
Anyway , here are the graphs comparing NetBSD 1.6.1 with NetBSD - CURRENT as of today , Oct 20 2003 :
socket : whoa , someone broke something here .
While the bulk of the time is still spent on the same graph as for 1.6.1 , there are several shadow graphs above it .
bind : looks about the same , but the graph goes up earlier , so apparently the size of the data structure increased slightly , causing it to leave the CPU cache earlier .
connect : same .
fork :
The scalability actually deteriorated for this benchmark .
It 's still O( n ) .
When running the fork benchmark , the system became unresponsive ( fix this ! ) .
Here is a graph for static linking that looks not so grim , so the dynamically linked fork is apparenty caused by libc becoming more bloated .
mmap : basically the same graph , the tendency is a very slight improvement .
touch after mmap : BIG improvement here !
http request latency : it sure shows that NetBSD - CURRENT now has kqueue !
[ Nov 1 2003 ] I got an email suggesting that I re-check NetBSD .
The results are nothing short of astonishing .
In two weeks time the NetBSD team made dramatic improvements .
socket : previously O( n ) , now O ( 1 ) .
bind : greatly improved , but still O( n ) .
Much less steep , though .
fork : a modest O(n ) for dynamically linked programs , O ( 1 ) for statically linked .
mmap : a bad O ( n ) before , now O ( 1 ) with a small O ( n ) shadow .
touch after mmap : a bad strange graph in 1.6.1 , a modest O( n ) a week ago , now O ( 1 ) .
http request latency : previously O( n ) , now O ( 1 ) .
Congratulations , NetBSD !
NetBSD now has better scalability than FreeBSD .
OpenBSD
[ Oct 20 2003 ] I was asked by a few OpenBSD people why I 'm even comparing them here , since " everyone knows " they do n't scale well and their goal is security and not scalability .
The answer is : I did n't know that OpenBSD did not try to improve scalability as well .
But even if I did know that , I would still have benchmarked them , if only to give people some numbers on how much less scalability they should expect .
Knowing how much less scalability you get is also an important part of the decision process .
And I also hope that security and scalability are not mutually exclusive and some volunteer veteran OpenBSD users will now be motivated to help port some scalability enhancements from FreeBSD and NetBSD to OpenBSD .
My " fork crashes " problem was already reproduced and the OpenBSD people are working on it .
That was fast ! ;)
FreeBSD
[ Oct 22 2003 ]
I was asked many times to also benchmark FreeBSD 4 - STABLE , because people thought it was more optimized than the unstable development branch FreeBSD 5 - CURRENT .
Yesterday I downloaded the ISO and today I installed and benchmarked 4.9- RC3 .
As for NetBSD , I plotted the graphs for 4.9 against the graphs for 5.1 - CURRENT .
Here are the results :
socket latency
This graph is interesting because 4.9 is the inverse of the 5.1 here .
Scalability is still very good .
This graph is interesting because 4.9 is the inverse of the 5.1 here .

bind to port 0 latency
This graph looks quite strange .
I do n't know what is wrong with FreeBSD 4.9 here , but look at the scale !
These numbers are actually worse than the NetBSD numbers .
I took this benchmark five times and got the same numbers in all runs , so this is systemic and looks like it needs fixing .

fork latency
This graph shows how much improved the scalability and latency of FreeBSD 5 - CURRENT is .
It even looks like the FreeBSD 4 graph is worse than O( n ) .
Maybe someone with one or two gigs of RAM can run this benchmark further and send me the graph ?

mmap latency
This graph actually has FreeBSD 4 ahead of FreeBSD 5 .
It looks like some the size of each element in a central VM data structure has doubled in size or so .
Still , the general scalability is the same .

touch - after - mmap latency
No change .
No change .
connect latency

No change .
http request latency
Here FreeBSD 4 does not have the curious sudden performance improvement after 4000 open connections .
Other than that , both have O ( 1 ) scalability .
fork cleanup
[ Oct 23 2003 ] Niels Provos suggested also measuring the fork cleanup time by killing the process .
The graph is indeed quite interesting ( zoomed version without NetBSD ) .
You have to read this graph backwards .
A position 0 we have lots of processes , so killing and waiting is expensive .
As we kill off one process after the other , it becomes less and less expensive .
Since fork is benchmarked a lot , it is optimized well , but cleaning up after fork is equally important but not benchmarked at all .
I could only run OpenBSD up to 2000 processes , and NetBSD up to 4000 processes , but important is not the length of each graph , but the angle .
This is the first graph where Linux 2.6 does not perform O ( 1 ) , by the way !
fork latency revisited
[ Oct 23 2003 ]
It turns out that my fork benchmark was unfair to the BSDs .
I neglected to measure fork latency for statically linked binaries on NetBSD and OpenBSD , because I assumed the fork latency was because of a bad fork implementation .
As this graph shows , fork is O ( 1 ) on all BSDs if the binaries are statically linked !
This still indicates a bad fork implementation , but this means it can be worked around in practice .
I apologize to NetBSD and OpenBSD for only noticing this now .
mmapping many small files
[ Oct 23 2003 ]
Thor Lancelot Simon suggested that my mmap benchmark ( mapping every other page from a big file ) was actually taking a different code path than what I wanted to benchmark : mmapping many small files .
I updated the CVS to include a program to create many small files and a variant of the mmap benchmark to mmap these in order .
If you want to repeat this test , please make sure you read README .
manymapbench first !
Since this benchmark also opens many files , I also did an open test on this , which is purely informational because it uses ext2fs on OpenBSD instead of the native UFS ( because of my partition space problems , see above ) , but I thought you might be interested anyway .
Again , all the files and directories are read - only and in the buffer cache , so journaling and softupdates do not influence this graph .
Here is the open graph .
As you can see , Linux 2.6 appears to be the only one achieving O ( 1 ) here .
There are 10000 files total , 100 of them in one subdirectory ( this is how actual applications like squid or qmail do it , putting a 10000 files in one directory has been benchmarked by others ) , so this should be pretty close to O ( 1 ) except for the cost of allocating the file descriptor maybe .
After opening each file , the benchmark mmaps the whole file ( each file is about 150 bytes , so mmapping the complete file maps one page ) .
Here is the mmap graph ( zoomed version with only OpenBSD and Linux 2.6 ) .
After mmapping each file , the benchmark again reads one byte from each page to cause a page fault .
One obvious optimization for this case ( mmapping the whole file , and it is very small ) would be to directly map the page , not wait for the page fault , and that appears to be what FreeBSD is doing .
Here is the manymap touch graph ( zoomed version without OpenBSD ) .
This graph shows the curious behaviour that the strange OpenBSD pattern only occurs starting at file 6600 or so , so OpenBSD 's performance in this case is OK if you can limit yourself to 6500 or less pages .
... and how to fake Lisp macros with Template Haskell
( I wrote this article in response to a comment by sigfpe .
You may find it pretty dry reading , unless you want to build domain - specific languages in Haskell .
Proceed at your own risk . )
Haskell 's built - in Monad type has some serious limitations .
We can fix those limitations using a number of advanced Haskell techniques , including Template Haskell , Haskell 's closest equivalent to Lisp macros .
We can illustrate the limitations of Monad with an example from math .
In set theory , we can define a set by specifying how to compute each element :
{ xy : x ∈ { 1,2,4} , y ∈ { 1,2,4} }
We can read this as , " the set of all xy , where x is one of { 1,2,4} , and y is one of { 1,2,4} . "
To calculate the answer , we first multiply together all the possible combinations :
1×1=1 , 1×2=2 , 1×4=4 , 2×1=2 , 2×2=4 , 2×4=8 , 4×1=4 , 4×2=8 , 4×4=16
We then collect up the answers , and --- because we 're working with sets -- we throw away the duplicates :
{ 1,2,4,8,16}
Can we do the same thing in Haskell ?
Well , using Haskell 's list monad , we can write :
listExample = do x <- [ 1 , 2 , 4 ] y <- [ 1 , 2 , 4 ] return ( x * y )
But when we run this , Haskell gives us lots of duplicate values :
> listExample [ 1 , 2 , 4 , 2 , 4 , 8 , 4 , 8 , 16 ]
Our problem :
We 're using lists ( which can contain duplicate values ) to represent sets ( which can 't ) .
Can we fix this by switching to Haskell 's Data .
Set ?
import qualified Data .
Set as S --
This does n't work .
setExample = do x <- S . fromList [ 1 , 2 , 4 ] y <- S . fromList [ 1 , 2 , 4 ] return ( x * y )
Unfortunately , this code fails spectacularly .
A Haskell monad is required to work for any types a and b :
class Monad m where return :: a -> m a fail :: String -> m a ( >>= ) :: m a -> ( a -> m b ) -> m b
But Data .
Set only works for some types .
Specifically , it requires that values of type a can be ordered :
data ( Ord a ) =>
Set a = ...
As it turns out , we can make Data .
Set into a monad .
But be warned :
The solution involves some pretty ugly Haskell abuse .
Splitting Monad in half
If we want to put a restrictions on a and b , we 'll need to move them into the signature of Monad .
My first attempt looked like this :
{-# LANGUAGE MultiParamTypeClasses , UndecidableInstances #-} import Prelude hiding ( return , fail , ( >>= ) ) import qualified Prelude --
This wo n't work : class NewMonad m a b where return :: a -> m a fail :: String -> m a ( >>= ) :: m a -> ( a -> m b ) -> m b
Unfortunately , the type b does n't appear anywhere in return or fail .
This makes the type checker sad .
But there 's a workaround , discovered by oleg .
We can split Monad into two pieces :
class Monad1 m a where return :: a -> m a fail :: String -> m a class ( Monad1 m a , Monad1 m b ) =>
Monad2 m a b where ( >>= ) :: m a -> ( a -> m b ) -> m b
Using these type classes , we can finally make Set a monad :
instance ( Ord a ) => Monad1 S .
Set a where return = S . singleton fail _ = S . empty instance ( Ord a , Ord b ) => Monad2 Set .
Set a b where m >>= f = ( setJoin .
S . map f ) m where setJoin = S . unions .
S . toList
This gets us very close to our goal :
setExample :: S .
Set Int setExample = S . fromList [ 1 , 2 , 4 ] >>= \ x -> S . fromList [ 1 , 2 , 4 ] >>= \ y -> return ( x * y )
When we run this code , the duplicates are gone :
> setExample fromList [ 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 , 16 ]
Rebuilding do : Macros
Unfortunately , GHC wo n't let us use the built - in do syntax .
Even though we 've carefully hidden the regular >>= operator , GHC goes digging around in the libraries and finds it anyway .
So we need to somehow replace the built - in do with a new version that uses our redefined >>= .
Update : As Brandon points out below , we can get the same result with - fno - implicit - prelude , which will force GHC to use whatever >>= is in scope .
Thanks , Brandon !
We can build our own version of do using Template Haskell .
Template Haskell allows us to generate code at compile - time , in fashion similar to Lisp macros .
In the code below , $ (... ) means " insert some code here , " and [ |...| ] parses an expression and returns it as a data structure .
setExample ' :: S . Set Int setExample ' = $ ( restricted [ | do x <- S . fromList [ 1 , 2 , 4 ] y <- S . fromList [ 1 , 2 , 4 ] return ( x * y ) | ] )
The function restricted maps a parsed expression to another parsed expression .
As it turns out , we 're not allowed to define restricted ( or any of our earlier type classes ) in the same file as setExample ' .
So we need to create a file " RestrictedMonad.hs " and move all our definitions into it :
{-# LANGUAGE MultiParamTypeClasses , UndecidableInstances , TemplateHaskell #-} module RestrictedMonad ( Monad1 , Monad2 , return , fail , ( >>= ) , restricted ) where import Prelude hiding ( return , fail , ( >>= ) ) import qualified Prelude import qualified Data .
Set as S import Language .
Haskell .TH import Language .Haskell.TH.Syntax --
Our earlier definitions go here ...
Now , we can define our " macro " :
-- Maps a quoted expression to a quoted -- expression .
restricted :: Q Exp -> Q
Exp restricted code = do ( DoE stmts ) <- code expand stmts
Before we can define expand , we need one more piece .
Template Haskell is based on monads , and we 've redefined the built - in monad operators .
To generate our replacement code , we 'll need to use the built - in return operator :
ret :: a ->
Q a ret = Prelude .
return
Now we 're ready to define expand .
This function expands a parsed do - body into a series of function calls .
The implementation gets a little messy at times , due to limitations in Template Haskell .
-- pat <- expr ; stmts ...
We use lamE here -- because we can't insert ' pat ' directly -- into the [ |...| ] form . -- --
Note that we do n't call ' fail ' on -- pattern - match failure , but we should .
expand ( BindS pat expr : stmts ) = [ | $ ( ret expr ) >>= $ ( lamE [ ret pat ] ( expand stmts ) ) | ] -- let decls ... ; stmts ... expand ( LetS decls : stmts ) = letE ( fmap ret decls ) ( expand stmts ) --
The final expression in the ' do ' .
expand ( NoBindS expr : [ ] ) = ret expr -- expr ; stmts ... expand ( NoBindS expr : stmts ) = [ | $ ( ret expr ) >>= ( \ _ -> $ ( expand stmts ) ) | ] expand stmts = error ( " Malformed ' do ' : " ++ show stmts )

Some lesser - known monad laws
There are three well - known laws that all monads must obey .
But there are some lesser - known monad laws that are automatically enforced in standard Haskell , thanks to the type checker .
But now that we allow our monad to use the operations defined by Ord , we need to prove these extra laws manually .
This should be a complete list :
-- The standard monad laws .
join .
return == id join .
fmap return == id join .
join == join .
fmap join --
The other monad laws : Return and join -- are natural transformations .
fmap f . return == return .
f fmap f . join == join .
fmap ( fmap f ) --
The functor laws .
fmap id == id fmap ( f . g ) == fmap f . fmap g
While reading Larry O'Brien 's latest column in SD Times , I could n't help noticing that the article text was dwarfed by the advertisements .
I was curious exactly how much of the page was dedicated to advertising .
There 's a clever technique used in the book Homepage Usability : 50 Websites Deconstructed to measure the composition of webpages .
The fifty corporate homepages used in the book did n't contain much advertising , but I was still amazed how little screen real estate is dedicated to actual content .
Let 's apply the same technique to the SD Times page .
I 'll highlight navigation , content , and advertising .
A full third of the page is dedicated to advertising .
That 's more than the content itself !
I carried a torch for micropayments for years , but it 's never going to happen .
Ad - supported content appears to be the only sustainible business model on the internet .
Clay Shirky has been saying this for years .
Just open a web browser and it's painfully obvious that he was right .
The web is awash in advertising .
This model , which generates income by making content widely available over open networks without charging user fees , is usually called ' ad - supported content ' , and it is currently very much in disfavor on the Internet .
I believe however , that not only can ad - supported content work on the Internet , I believe it can't not work .
Its success is guaranteed by the net 's very makeup - the net is simply too good at gathering communities of interest , too good at freely distributing content , and too lousy at keeping anything locked inside subscription networks , for it to fail .
Like TV , the net is better at getting people to pay attention than anything else .
Indeed , ad - supported content is the house that AdWords built .
It 's difficult to criticize a system that works , a system that allows content creators to at least break even on their hosting costs .
We watched the movie Idiocracy this weekend .
It 's a brilliant bit of social satire from Mike Judge , which ( among other things ) takes ad - subsidized content to its logical extremes .
People wear nothing but clothes plastered with corporate logos .
Wallpaper and lampshades are made up of patterns of tiny corporate logos .
Every square inch of every imaginable surface is covered with billboards and even more advertisements .
Watching television in Idiocracy bears an unfortunate resemblance to reading that SD Times article .
To be fair , Larry 's content is a bit more highbrow than " Ow ! My Balls ! " .
But it 's still a tiny window of content , surrounded by dozens of flashing , animated advertisements .
It 's a disturbing vision of the future .
It 's supposed to be funny , but it 's uncomfortably close to the experience of reading today 's ad - supported internet content .
Are we creating a world of endless advertising ?
Parents often get a bad rap when it comes to video games .
If they are n't complaining about how violent games are and then ignorantly buying their children the same games in the quest for pacifism , they 're on a crusade to get their children to go outside and enjoy the real world .
However , nothing you 've seen , heard , or read before will prepare you for the latest parental concern regarding video games .
National Public Radio posted a commentary from Kelly McBride , a concerned parent , regarding her children 's frequent use of the Wii .
Rather than relishing the fact that the new toy has them off the couch and swinging their arms , Kelly worries that her children are equating the game version of the sports with the real - life counterpart ; that is to say , the children are gaining " a false sense of what it 's like to compete in the world . "
The two minute commentary begins with Kelly outlining her dreams for fit children who come home sweaty and bruised after a game of pick - up baseball .
She then proceeds to patronize her own children 's new affinity for sports via Wii Sports .
She mocks their sudden interest in these virtual sports and their so - called " exercise , " despite the obvious physical benefits .
She belittles their understanding of the real sports , only to widen her target to attack all the over - weight children of America and their newfound self - esteem before finally questioning whether or not these children will ever know the true sense of accomplishment that only reality can provide .
As her commentary draws to a close , one can only think that her children 's supposed self - esteem problems do n't stem from their lack of interest in sports .
Her only plausible point — that a drop in self - esteem may occur should the children attempt the real sport and fail — can be quickly dismissed when you consider that such a drop in self - esteem would occur upon failing regardless of whether or not they first played Wii Sports .
Rather than embrace the fact that her children are more active in their game - playing and may be pushed to go out and play the real sport , Kelly is more interested in placing the blame for her children 's failures on the toy that is so cruelly depriving them of the natural inclination to go out and swing a racquet .
I find it amazing that the advances towards physical activity in gaming offered by the likes of DDR and the Wii are already being attacked by parents who are seeking to blame their own maladies on someone else .
I 'm honestly surprised that an argument against the exercise offered by the Wii even surfaced ; if they were n't playing the Wii , they 'd certainly be playing something else that had nowhere near an equivalent level of physical activity .
Alas , perhaps my own investment and belief in the direction Nintendo has taken is skewing my interpretation of this commentary .
What do you guys think ?
Does she have a point ?
This is a list of HTML elements I 've found to be very poorly represented in most markup on the web today .
Many of these elements offer more semantic value than actual functionality , but with the rising popularity of CSS driven design where HTML elements are used for what they were actually intended for , I felt shining a little light on them was appropriate .
< address >
The < address > tag was intended to contain address , signature , and authorship information .
Phone and fax numbers , physical street addresses , email addresses , AIM / ICQ / Yahoo / etc , and any other online or offline contact data are all valid .
Typically < address > elements are found at the top or bottom of a document .
Usage :
< address > My Company < br /> 1234 Somewhere Lane < br />
Seattle , WA < br />
Phone : ( 123 ) 456-7890 < br />
Fax : ( 123 ) 456-7890 </ address >
What 's the point ?
I can do the same thing with a < div > tag
Elements grouped with < div > have no semantic value unless they 're assigned to a class or ID .
Why create < div class= " contact " > when there 's already an element to do it for you ?
Example :
address { background : url(/images/bg_address.jpg ) no -repeat bottom left ; padding : 35 px 0 35 px 35 px ; font - style : normal ; } < address > < a href = " https://moz.com/matt.php " >
Matt Inman</a> < br /> SEOmoz.org LLC < br /> 4314 Roosevelt Way NE < br />
Seattle , WA 98105 </ address >
Output : Matt Inman
SEOmoz.org LLC
4314 Roosevelt Way NE
Seattle , WA 98105
Elements grouped with < div > have no semantic value unless they 're assigned to a class or ID .
Why create < div class= " contact " > when there 's already an element to do it for you ? < q >
Note : Apparently this little gem does n't work in IE .
Sorry folks .
W3C specs it , actual attempts prove otherwise .
A List Apart has an interesting article on how to make < q > work .
Many web developers ( myself included ) have fallen into the practice of using character entities such as &quo ; to quote text .
The < q > tag does this for us - it'll surround the enclosed text in quotes .
Embedded Quotation
One of the cool features of using the < q > tag is the behavior of embedded quotes .
If you enlose a < q > tag within another < q > tag it'll automatically switch quotation types .
The default is outer < q > elements are surrounded in double quotes and inner < q > elements are surrounded in single quotes .
This is particularly useful if you 're writing copy that involves heavy use of quotes within quotes , such as character dialogue .
Example :
< q >
The internet , or < q > interweb </q > , is full of bitchin content </ q > ,
said Matt ,
< q > If I were to surf the < q > interweb </q >
I 'd totally do it nekkid
</ q >
Output :
The internet , or interweb , is full of bitchin content , said Matt , If I were to surf the interweb I 'd totally do it nekkid
Styling your quoted content
You can define the type of quotes that are rendered using the following CSS command :
q { quotes : " Â « " " Â » " " ' " " ' " ; }
The first two values specify the first level of quotation embedding , the next two values specify the second level of quote embedding .
Using < q > instead of character entities also allows you to apply CSS styles to your quoted content such as color , font - style , font - weight , etc .

Ever had a bunch of < option > elements inside a < select > box that you wanted to group into categories but did n't want those categories to be select - able ?
< optgroup > does just that .
Example :
< select > < optgroup label= " Mammals " > < option value = " dogs " > Dogs </ option > < option value = " mrrow " > Cats </option > < option value = " pigs " > Pigs</ option > </optgroup > < optgroup label= " Reptiles " > < option value = " lizards " > Lizards </ option > < option value = " geckos " >
Geckos </ option > < option value = " iguanas " > Iguanas </ option > </optgroup > </ select >
Output :
Dogs Cats Pigs Lizards Geckos Iguanas
Ever had a bunch of < option > elements inside a < select > box that you wanted to group into categories but did n't want those categories to be select - able ?
< optgroup > does just that .
Dogs Cats Pigs Lizards Geckos Iguanas < acronym > or < abbr > combined with the title attribute The < acronym > and < abbr > tags define acronyms and abbreviations .
In addition to offering semantic value , using these in combination with the title attribute will show the expanded version of the expression when you hover over the element .
Example :
< acronym title= " Search Engine Optimization " > SEO </ acronym >
Output :
SEO
The < acronym > and < abbr > tags define acronyms and abbreviations .
In addition to offering semantic value , using these in combination with the title attribute will show the expanded version of the expression when you hover over the element .
< fieldset > and < legend > < fieldset > is an excellent element to use when grouping items inside your form .
By default it 'll draw a box around whatever elements it contains , combine it with < legend > to easily caption your form data .
Styling the fieldset
You can easily style your < fieldset > using CSS :
fieldset { border - top : 1 px solid #efefef ; border - left : 1 px solid #efefef ; border - bottom : 1 px solid #ccc ; border - right : 1 px solid #ccc ; padding : 1em 1em 1 em 1.5 e m ; } fieldset : hover { background : url(/images/bg_fieldset.gif ) repeat-y ; border : 1 px solid # 3A789D ; } Output :

Now that I 'm done writing this entry I suppose I should get started on the task of putting these elements to use on the SEOmoz site itself . :)

CHICAGO ( Reuters ) -
Tiny bits of protein extracted from a 68 - million - year - old dinosaur bone have given scientists the first genetic proof that the mighty Tyrannosaurus rex is a distant cousin to the modern chicken .
“ It ’s the first molecular evidence of this link between birds and dinosaurs , ” said John Asara , a Harvard Medical School researcher , whose results were published in Friday ’s edition of the journal Science .
Scientists have long suspected that birds evolved from dinosaurs based on a study of dinosaur bones , but until recently , no soft tissue had survived to confirm the link .
That all changed in 2005 when Mary Higby Schweitzer of North Carolina State University reported finding soft tissue , including blood vessels and cells , in a T. rex bone dug out of sandstone from the fossil - rich Hell Creek Formation in Montana .
Schweitzer , in another study appearing in this week ’s issue of Science , found that extracts of T. rex bone reacted with antibodies to chicken collagen , further suggesting the presence of birdlike protein in dinosaur bones .
For his study , Asara used a highly sensitive technology called mass spectrometry to determine the chemical makeup of bone fragments provided by Schweitzer and her team .
He first had to purify the bone extract , which came in the form of a gritty brown powder that remained after minerals were extracted .
Asara then broke it down into peptide fragments , little bits of proteins , isolated into the amino acid sequences that make them up .
“ It was very tough to get anything , ” he said in a telephone interview .
He wound up with seven separate strands of amino acid , five of which were a particular class of collagen , a fibrous protein found in bone .
Next , Asara had to interpret the sequences .
He compared his results to collagen data from living animals .
Most matched collagen from chickens , while others matched a newt and frog .
BIRDS OF A FEATHER
“ Based on all of the genomic information we have available today , it appears these sequences are closer to birds or chickens than anything else , ” Asara said .
Ultimately , scientists had hoped to find genetic material that was unique to the T. rex .
That was not possible with the tiny T. rex sample .
“ We never found unique T. rex tags , ” he said .
In a similar study of mastodon bones supplied by Schweitzer , Asara had more luck .
He compared the samples to a database of existing amino acid sequences and against a theoretical set of mastodon sequences and found a total of 78 peptides , including four unique sequences .
Still , Asara said the T. rex protein sequence was useful in providing clues about the evolution of the species .
The researchers said the results may change the way that people think about fossil preservation .
“ The fact that we are getting proteins is very exciting , ” said palaeontologist Jack Horner , who dug up the T. rex in 2003 and is co-author of the paper with Schweitzer .
Horner said palaeontologists will need to dig deeper for specimens that have not been corrupted by ground water and bacteria .
“ I think we are going to find that many specimens are like it .
It will be a matter of palaeontologists getting into sites that are not necessarily easy , ” he told reporters in a telephone briefing .
James Baker III and the seven dwarfs of the " Iraq Study Group " have come up with some simply brilliant recommendations .
Not. Baker 's Two Big Ideas are : 1 . Stay half the course .
Keeping 140,000 troops in Iraq is a disaster getting more disastrous .
The Baker Boys ' idea : cut the disaster in half -- leave 70,000 troops there .
But here 's where dumb gets dumber : the Bakerites want to " embed " US forces in Iraqi Army units .
Question one , Mr. Baker : What Iraqi Army ?
This so - called " army " is a rough confederation of Shia death squads .
We can tell our troops to get " embedded " with them , but the Americans wo n't get much sleep .
2. " Engage " Iran .
This is a good one .
How can we get engaged when George Bush has n't even asked them out for a date ?
What will induce the shy mullahs of Iran to accept our engagement proposal ?
Answer : The Bomb .
Let me explain .
To get the Iranians to end their subsidizing the Mahdi Army and other Shia cut - throats , the Baker bunch suggest we let the permanent members of the UN Security Council -- plus , Germany -- decide the issue of Iran 's nukes .
Attaching Germany is the signal .
These signers of the Non-Proliferation Treaty ( NPT ) agree that Iran should be allowed a " peaceful " nuclear power program .
More ...
Now , I am absolutely wary of neo -con nuts who want to blow Iran to Kingdom - come over its nuclear ambitions .
But that does n't mean we should kid ourselves .
Iran has zero need of " peaceful " nuclear - generated electricity .
It has the second - largest untapped reserve of natural gas on the planet , a clean , safe , cheap source of power .
There 's only one reason for a " nuclear " program , and it's not to light Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's bedside lamp .
Here 's the problem with Baker 's weird combo of embedding our boys with Iraq 's scary army while sucking up to the Iranians : it wo n't work .
The mayhem will continue , with Americans in the middle , because the Baker brigade dares not mention two words : " Saudi " and " Arabia .
" Saudi Arabia is the elephant in the room ( camel in the tent ? ) that can't be acknowledged -- and the reason Baker is so desperately anxious to sell America on keeping half our soldiers in harm 's way .
James III wants to seduce or bully Iran into stopping their funding of the murderous Shia militias .
But the Shias only shifted into mass killing mode in response to the murder spree by Sunni " insurgents .
"
Where do the Sunnis get their money for mayhem ?
According to a seething memo by the National Security Agency ( November 8 , 2006 ) , the Saudis control the , " public or private funding provided to the insurgents or death squads . "
Nice .
Baker wants us to bribe or blackmail Iran into stopping one side in Iraq 's uncivil war , the Shia .
Yet we close our eyes to the Saudis acting as a piggy bank for the other side , the Sunni berserkers .
( The House of Saud follows Wahabi Islam , a harsh , fundamentalist sect of Sunnism . )
Why is Baker , ordinarily such a tough guy , so coy with the Saudis ?
Baker Botts , the law firm he founded , became a wealthy powerhouse by representing Saudi Arabia .
But do n't worry , the Iraq Study Group is balanced by Democrats including Vernon Jordan of the law firm of Akin , Gump which represents … Saudi royals .
Of course , the connections between Baker , the Bush Family and the Saudis go way beyond a few legal bills .
( See , " The Best Little Legal Whorehouse in Texas " from my book Armed Madhouse .
Baker is more than aware that , two weeks ago , Dick Cheney dropped his Thanksgiving turkey to fly to Riyadh at the demand of the Saudis for a dressing down by King Abdullah .
The Saudis have made it clear that they will crank up their payments to warriors in Iraq to protect their Sunni brothers if America pulls out our troops .
King Abdullah 's wish is Cheney 's command -- and Baker 's too .
The Saudis want 70,000 US troops baby - sitting the Shia killers in Iraq 's Army -- and so we will stay .
What gives King Abdullah the power to ghost - write the Iraq Study Group recommendations ?
It 's not because the Saudis sell us broccoli .
And therein lies the danger .
Behind the fratricidal fracas in Iraq is something even more dangerous than bullets in Baghdad : a proxy war between Iran and Saudi Arabia to control Iraq 's place in OPEC , the oil cartel .
What is painted by Baker 's Iraq Study Group as an ancient local clash between Shia and Sunni over the Kingdom of God , is , in fact , a remote control proxy war between Iran and Saudi Arabia over the Kingdom of Oil. --- Greg Palast is the author of the New York Times bestseller , " Armed Madhouse " which includes Palast 's investigation , conducted for Harper 's Magazine , of the secret role of James Baker III and Saudi Arabia in the forming of US plans for Iraq 's oil .

Lessons From The Roundabout SEO Test
My favorite comedian of all time , the late great Mitch Hedberg , once told a joke about what he called “ The Roundabout AIDS test . ”
Click Mitch ’s mouth below to hear it :
While obviously not meant in any serious manner , the joke reminds me of my attitude towards SEO , or “ Search Engine Optimization ” .
A lot of people spend an inordinate amount of time making sure all of their pages are specifically geared towards achieving a high ranking on Google .
While I understand the business objectives of such an obsession , I find my own attitude towards SEO much more apathetic .
I ’m a lot more interested in how many people subscribe to Mike Industries than how many people typed in something like “ expiring domain ” and somehow ended up at my site .
So for that reason , my SEO activity is limited to my own little “ Roundabout SEO Test ” , which I perform a few times a year .
It ’s a very simple test and takes only a few seconds to execute .
Here is the procedure :
1 . Go to google.com .
2 . Type in “ mike ” .
3 . Hit return .
4 . Take note of how high or low Mike Industries is on the list of results .
That ’s it .
Yes , it seems a little narcissistic , and yes , it ’s not a true measure of how well each page on this site is optimized for search engines , but it ’s a general indication of how well or poorly this blog is doing and that ’s really all I ’m interested in .
In running this Roundabout SEO Test since creating Mike Industries last year , I ’ve seen my ranking among Mikes climb from in the thousands , to in the hundreds , to the top 50 , to the top twenty , and most recently to number 5 .
Number 5 is great and I ’m totally cool with it considering that my parents were unoriginal enough to christen me with the most popular name in the 70s , 80s , and 90s , but now that the list of “ competitors ” is down to 4 , I thought I ’d take a close look at why the pecking order on Google is the way it is .
In other words , what are the factors which most affect search results in the real world ?
First , a rundown of the combatants :
1. Mike Little
PageRank : 7
Household Name : No
Code Quality : Very good .
Mentions : 30,200
Incoming Links : 16,400
“ Mike ” appearances in source : 54
Notes : Mike is known for his contributions to WordPress , and like Matt Mullenweg , auto - Matt-ically appears in the sidebars of many WordPress blogs .
He is also a diabolical genius in his ability to put 54 mentions of his name in his page source without being “ spammy ” .
I fear any attempt to “ outmike ” him would require me being “ spammy ” .
He is the king , and will probably remain that way .
2. Michael Moore
PageRank : 8
Household Name : Yes
Code Quality : Average .
Old - school table layout .
Mentions : 218,000
Incoming Links : 18,500
“ Mike ” appearances in source : 13
Notes : Michael makes wildly popular , wildly controversial films that are praised and reviled the world over .
3. Mike Portnoy
PageRank : 5
Household Name : No
Code Quality : Oh my god .
This is not even HTML .
Mentions : 44,200
Incoming Links : 417
“ Mike ” appearances in source : 1
Notes :
Mike was is the drummer for a now not defunct rock band called “ Dream Theater ” .
4. Mike DeWine
PageRank : 7
Household Name : Maybe in Ohio
Code Quality : Bad .
Frames , tables , etc .
Mentions : 23,900
Incoming Links : 301
“ Mike ” appearances in source : 1
Notes : Mike is a senator from Ohio who apparently supports the frameset initiative .
5 . Your self - absorbed host , me , Mike Davidson
PageRank : 8
Household Name : Ha !
Code Quality : Very good … minus the intentional invalidation stuff .
Mentions : 38,800
Incoming Links : 1,870
“ Mike ” appearances in source : 21
Notes : Works and plays well with others .
Ok , so there are two combatants that I ’m particularly puzzled with here .
See if you can guess which ones .
Number one is the republican Senator from Ohio Mike DeWine .
His PR , Code Quality , Mentions , Links , and “ number of mikes ” in source are all less than mine , and yet , he ’s number 4 .
The guy ’s entire site is a frameset too , so let ’s put to rest any suspicions that framesets disqualify you from good SEO .
The only few things I can think of which may have led to Senator DeWine ’s SEO ranking are 1 ) he has a .gov domain , which may yield an advantage over a .com , 2 ) of his measly 312 links , most of them might come from other .gov sites which have high Page Ranks as well , and 3 ) most people might link to him by name ( e.g. vote for “ Mike DeWine ” ) whereas many of my links might not even contain my name ( e.g. “ sIFR ” technology is evil and kills kittens ) .
Ok , so Senator DeWine is the first curious result , but the second is much more confounding and — really — 90 % of the reason why I decided to even write this article :
Mike Portnoy .
This guy was is in a rock group called “ Dream Theater ” a long time ago and whoever is doing his site for him writes the worst HTML I ’ve ever seen .
Seriously .
The worst .
It ’s so bad that I ’m just going to go ahead and paste the entire source of his front page right here :
< TITLE > Mike Portnoy.com - The Official Website</ TITLE >
< LINK title=default href= " /inc/mp2.css " type=text /css rel=stylesheet >
</HEAD >
< BODY >
< br >< br >< br >
< div align=" center " >
<img src= " /images/mp-hof.jpg " >
< br >< br >< br >
[ < a href= " / default2.asp " >
Enter MP.COM </a >]
Yep , that ’s the whole thing .
The kid who coded the site did n’t even give poor Mike an HTML tag .
I guess I do n’t blame him considering he probably only got an acid - washed denim jacket and a pair of drumsticks out of it .
I also find it ironic that there is actually a call to a stylesheet amidst this neanderthal mess , but whatever .
It ’s awful … and I wo n’t even get into the actual design of the site .
We ’ve already done that once this year . :)
* Note : It looks like Mike ’s front page was updated ( slightly ) for the better just this week .
Still no HTML tags but here ’s what it looked like for the past two years ( and when this test was run ) .
When I saw Mike Portnoy ’s site at # 3 among all Mikes and then peeped the corresponding code , I had a giant moment of doubt about the whole web standards movement .
If the worst code any human being has ever produced gets a narrowly - known drummer to the front of 251 million Mikes on Google , is SEO even a valid benefit of writing standards - friendly code ?
And furthermore , considering that said drummer has a PR of 5 and I have a PR of 8 ( supposedly three orders of magnitude or 1000 times greater ) , does PageRank matter at all in search result ranking ?
The only way we can find out is to test .
The Google Vacuum Tests
After witnessing the strange results from the Roundabout SEO Test , I set out to discover exactly what effect , if any , HTML code has on Google search results .
The first thing I did was make up a word .
That word is “ lodefizzle ” … a nickname given to the legendary Stephen Lodefink of Finkbuilt.com during our days at the Disney Internet Group .
I created 15 files in a new directory on my site which contained the term “ lodefizzle ” in different contexts .
Some had the word in the title element , some in the H1 element , some in the filename , etc etc etc .
The idea was to see how treatment of this word affected search result ranking within Google .
Here are the results from the five tests performed ( raw results here ) :
Test 1
Function :
To determine if using semantic tags like H1 boost ranking , and to what degree .
1a – Contains “ lodefizzle ” in an H1 tag .
1b – Contains “ lodefizzle ” in a B tag and one extra mention further down the page .
1c – Contains “ lodefizzle ” in a B tag .
The important test case is 1 b here .
It ’s a safe assumption that 1a would beat 1c ( and indeed it does ) , or else we might as well quit our jobs and start using FrontPage .
But the real question is , will one lousy extra instance of “ lodefizzle ” override the H1 tag ’s advantage and bump 1b past 1a ?
The answer : No .
Conclusion :
The H1 tag does indeed assert some dominance and we can therefore assume you are better off using proper headings in your HTML documents .
Somewhere , Molly and the recently reawakened Doug are smiling .
Test 2
Function :
To determine if the mere appearance of tables and nested tables penalizes search result ranking , and to what degree .
2a – Contains “ lodefizzle ” once in the document .
2b – Contains “ lodefizzle ” twice in the document and a 14 - deep nested table .
2c – Contains “ lodefizzle ” once in the document and a 14 - deep nested table .
All cases are important here , but once again , the one to watch is the middle one .
So we have two questions to answer :
Does the appearance of a nested table penalize you at all in search engine ranking ?
The answer : Yes .
Does an extra instance of “ lodefizzle ” in the source override this penalty ?
The answer : Yes .
Conclusion :
The mere appearance of many nested tables in your code does not have a strong enough negative effect to be considered a drag on search engine ranking .
I imagine the only negative affect at all was because the ratio of “ lodefizzle ” to other content on the page was slightly lowered by the addition of more code .
This , however , could be an argument to keep your code as small as possible .
Test 3
Function :
To determine if invalid code penalizes search result ranking , and to what degree .
3a – Contains “ lodefizzle ” once in the document , after a valid table .
3b – Contains “ lodefizzle ” twice in the document , after an invalid table .
3c – Contains “ lodefizzle ” once in the document , after an invalid table .
First , let me say that I expected all three of these results to be about the same , with 2b taking the cake only because of the extra mention .
I ’ve never really believed the claims of validatorians about bad code getting you booted off of Google .
So can invalid code get you penalized on search engines ?
The answer : Yes , to a draconian degree , in fact .
3a is the only document which even shows up on Google .
Whoa !
A full - on blackballing from the Big G .
We already know that 99 % of the world ’s web pages are invalid to some degree and they show up just fine on Google , so what happened here ?
Let ’s look .
The valid table I created looks like this :
< table class=" checkered " >< tr >< td >< div></div></td></tr></table>
… while the invalid table looks like this :
< table cloth= " checkered >< invalid >
The interesting part here is that while the source code of all three test cases looks pretty similar , the appearance of the pages in a browser is completely different .
The invalid pages , in fact , do n’t even render ( at least in most browsers they do n’t ) .
The reason for this is the degree to which the code is malformed .
The missing quote on the end of the “ checkered ” attribute is causing the entire page to fail and the word “ lodefizzle ” to not even appear on the rendered page .
What ’s really interesting to me is that Google is doing one of two things ( or both ) :
1. Somehow grading pages based on how they are rendered as well as how they are coded .
2. Simply counting the rest of the page as an attribute of the invalid table because the attribute is never officially closed off with an end quote .
There may also be other explanations to why this is happening , but this was the most interesting test in the bunch for me .
Conclusion :
It ’s not clear that validity helps search engine ranking , but it ’s definitely true that certain errors in your code can get you completely removed from indexes .
Test 4
Function :
To determine if semantics are more valuable than raw phrase placement on a page .
4a – Contains “ lodefizzle ” in an H1 tag , after the first paragraph on the page .
4b – Contains “ lodefizzle ” in an H4 tag , at the very top of the page .
The question here is , are semantics powerful enough to override a simple shift in placement of the keyword ?
The answer : Yes .
4a shows up well before 4b in the search results , even though keyword placement on 4b is theoretically better .
Conclusion :
The semantic effect of hierarchical HTML headings is a stronger factor in search rankings than more rudimentary measures such as physical keyword placement .
Test 5
Function :
To test if the advantage of clean , semantic HTML can be easily overridden by other factors .
5a – Contains “ lodefizzle ” in H1 , H2 , H3 , and H4 tags .
5b – Contains “ lodefizzle ” four times in normal text and once in the page title .
5c – Contains “ lodefizzle ” four times in normal text and is linked once from my old site , mdavidson.com .
5d – Contains “ lodefizzle ” four times in normal text and once in the filename .
Since we already know that good semantics do matter to an extent , the question is : will any or all of the methods in 5b , 5c , and 5d be strong enough to usurp the proper use of hierarchical headings ?
The answer : Yes , in all cases !
The winners , in order , were 5c , 5b , 5d … followed up by 5a .
* Note : Some time between when I ran these tests and now , the link between mdavidson.com and 5 c ceased to be recognized by Google , causing 5 c to drop to the bottom of the current search results .
I have no idea why this happened , but for the purposes of this test , we ’ll assume it did n’t .
Conclusion : Although good semantics are somewhat valuable in optimization , simple things like proper titles , descriptive filenames , and incoming links are dramatically more important .
Final analysis and lessons learned
Some of these results are commonsensical and some are not .
None are in the least bit scientific , so please do n’t tell me that .
I already know that much better tests could be performed .
The findings do support my initial suspicions about web standards as they relate to SEO though : that they matter about as much as a cheap umbrella in a hailstorm .
That is to say : “ kind of ” .
Developers should write clean , semantic code as a matter of professionalism rather than search engine optimization .
For good SEO , making your site sticky enough to attract quality incoming links is by far and away the thing to concentrate on .
In revisiting the list of five combatants above , it ’s now easy to see why Mike Portnoy ’s front page did not penalize him too much on Google .
It renders in the browser ( even without an HTML tag ! ) and his 44,000 mentions around the web are apparently enough to bump him into the # 3 spot .
“ But he has a PR of only 5 ! ” you say .
Well , apparently that does n’t matter a whole lot either .
From what I ’ve been able to gather , PR has a much greater effect on the link love you ’re able to give than the search engine placement you yourself actually receive .
While the findings from this test explain the placements of the top three Mikes , they still do n’t tell us anything about the republican Senator from Ohio , Mike DeWine .
I seem to kill him in every measurable category and yet , he ’s one slot ahead .
The conspiracy theorist in me says that Larry and Sergei are closet puppeteers in the political process of this country , but the realist tells me there ’s something else I have n’t considered .
Perhaps it ’s the unexposed “ quality ” of the incoming links …
I do n’t know .
What I do know is that , while this was a fun experiment , I wo n’t be mucking around with any more in - depth SEO tests .
The roundabout is good enough for me .
It probably wo n't be remembered as such , but last week was truly significant for the technology industry .
The proposed FAIR USE
Act was unveiled , and while many media outlets were busy praising it , the fact is that true DMCA reform has been abandoned .
Despite this , the RIAA came out swinging , and trashed the bill .
A conversation I had Friday with a mainstream media journalist on the topic really surprised me because the RIAA 's argument against the bill is n't being fully appreciated here .
As I tried to explain to this journalist , the RIAA is trying to preserve protections for its interests that run counter to how a civil society embraces freedom and responsibility .
Just as bad , the RIAA is making the fatal mistake of treating its honest customers like criminals who have to be supervised , while their staunch position does nothing to stem actual piracy .
In a nutshell , the RIAA argues that the DMCA 's anti-circumvention clause cannot be nuanced to allow for circumvention in special cases ( like fair use ) , because if any circumvention is allowed , then the cat 's out of the bag and piracy shall reign supreme .
DMCA scholars often spar over whether or not the blanket prohibition against circumventing access controls truly applies to fair use , but I think it 's quite clear what the RIAA and the content industry thinks : the DMCA makes circumvention illegal , period .
Does this all - or - nothing principle sound familiar ?
If you 're thinking of Prohibition in the United States , you 're right on the money .
Once upon a time powerful people in our society decided that alcohol could not be trusted in the hands of the common person .
If some folks can't be responsible with it , no one should have access .
You know how it played out : a large underground opened up , alcohol still flowed , but lots of people got caught up in a horrible situation that ruined lives , made cities unsafe , and punished millions of responsible people .
But let 's be 100 % clear : alcohol did n't vanish , and more than one scholar will tell you that Prohibition did more for alcohol than the marketers could have accomplished themselves .
The RIAA is like the Prohibitionists of old .
In their view , the law cannot allow for something completely reasonable such as legal circumvention because it could be abused .
Millions of people are thereby punished .
Yet this is not how a civil society typically functions .
Life is full of potentially dangerous products , services , and ideas .
It 's up to individuals to take responsibility for their actions , because we all know that catering to the lowest common denominator does not give birth to a free society , let alone an intelligent one .
Yet the RIAA will stop at nothing to make sure that you and I never have the chance to make such decisions for ourselves .
The absurdity of their arguments regarding the slippery slope of reform fails to recognize the most salient fact in all of this : anti-circumvention tools are easy to find , easy to use , and are being used every day .
And this says nothing of the fact that in the instance of music , CDs are distributed without DRM anyway .
In other words , the cat is already out of the bag , and the people who are inclined to infringe on copyright are doing it right now .
The only people left out in the cold are the honest users who are either afraid to circumvent access controls for fair use purposes , or lack the time and patience to go looking for tools .
No one benefits from this situation except the RIAA and friends , and of course their interests ultimately have little to do with anything but trying to create new artificial business models .

Last year protesters clashed with police at Mr Taha 's trial
Mohammed Taha ran the al - Wifaq paper and was taken from his home on Tuesday night by an unknown group of armed men .
Last year , he was put on trial for blasphemy after his pro-government paper reprinted an article questioning the parentage of the prophet Muhammad .
The charges were later dropped but if convicted of blasphemy under Sharia law , he could have been put to death .
The BBC's Jonah Fisher in Khartoum says no - one has claimed responsibility but suspicion will immediately turn to Sudan 's hardline Islamic groups .
In May last year , thousands of people demonstrated outside a courtroom in central Khartoum calling for Mr Taha to be put to death .
After several emotionally charged days the case was adjourned and later quietly dropped .
Our correspondent says the killing of Mr Taha , an ally of Khartoum 's Islamist government , will raise fears that extremist groups are once again active in Sudan .
Sudan provided a home for al - Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden in the 1990s and the country is still on the United States ' list of states sponsoring terrorism .
Khartoum has been governed by strict Islamic Sharia law since 1983 - but our correspondent says that in recent years courts have shown a degree of flexibility in their interpretations of Islamic law .
Well - I can comment on this as I recently had a nasty accident with my gear at a wedding .
Managed to knock the 5D with 24 - 70 2.8 L and 580EX flash off a limestone wall for a metre+ fall onto concreteThat is about $ 8000 AU worth of gear .
The terrible thing was that I did n't even know I had done it until I heard the sound of my gear hitting the concrete behind me .
The hard plastic Canon lens hood definitely saved the lens , 5D has a little scuff ( not as bad as when I took a fall on a glacier with it ) and the 580EX snapped at the bottom .
Fortunately this is a sacraficial part designed by Canon for events just like this - cost me $ 45 to get the part .
So - total cost for repair of possible $ 8000 accident - $ 45 plus delivery fee for overnight freight of $ 10 = $ 55 AU .
Thanks Canon for great design .
Thank you God for my little miracle .
The moral of the story - be more careful Chris ... and spend the extra for the original plastic lens hood .
Despite how all this sounds I do take good care of my gear - but accidents do happen .
A number of the booms in Japan , including Tamagotchi — basically a virtual pet that grew on a computer screen — and the fanciful cartoon characters of Pokémon , have made their way across the Pacific and swept up American children , too .
Image Hirofumi Sasaki , a pet store owner in Hiroshima , has seen so many defective dogs that last year he converted an old bar into a hospice to care for them .
So far he has taken in 32 dogs , though only 12 have survived .
Credit ... Masafumi Yamamoto for The New York Times
The affection for fads in Japan reflects its group - oriented culture , a product of the conformity taught in its grueling education system .
But booms also take off because they are fueled by big business .
Companies like Sony and Nintendo are constantly looking to create the next adorable hit , churning out cute new characters and devices .
Booms help sustain an entire industrial complex , from software makers to marketers and distributors , that thrives off the pack mentality of consumers in Japan .
The same thing is happening in Japan ’s fast - growing pet industry , estimated at more than $ 10 billion a year .
Chihuahuas are the current hot breed , after one starred in the television ads of a finance company .
In the early 1990s , a TV drama featuring a Siberian husky helped send annual sales rocketing from just a few hundred dogs to 60,000 ; sales fell when the fad cooled , according to the Japan Kennel Club .
The breed took off despite being inappropriately large for cramped homes in Japan .
The United States also experiences surges in sales of certain breeds , and some states have confronted “ puppy mills ” that churn out popular breeds by enacting “ puppy lemon laws ” that prevent breeders from selling diseased animals .
But in Japan , the sales spikes are far more extreme , statistics show .
The kennel club says unethical breeders try to cash in on the booms , churning out large volumes of puppies from a small number of parents .
While many breeders have stuck to healthy mating practices , the lure of profits has attracted less scrupulous breeders and led to proliferation of puppy mills .
Some veterinarians and other experts cite another , less obvious factor behind widespread risky inbreeding in Japan ’s dog industry — the nation ’s declining birthrate .
As the number of childless women and couples in Japan has increased , so has the number of dogs , which are being coddled and doted upon in place of children , experts say .
In the last decade , the number of pet dogs in Japan has doubled to 13 million last year — outnumbering children under 12 — according to Takashi Harada , president of Yaseisha , a publisher of pet industry magazines .
" We believe what Second Life did was great , but it 's time for ' virtual worlds 2.0 ' . . . unlimited , open , scalable worlds . "
Outback Online uses P2P networks of PCs , not central servers .
A P2P - powered virtual world draws on the network power of all participants - and could handle 100 times the visitors of the central server model , Yoick claims .
National ICT Australia ( NICTA ) developed the online game technology over three years to test scalable and economical applications .
Mr Leeb - du Toit , NICTA 's business development director , added a powerful graphics engine and spun - off Yoick .
" We decided what we needed to build was not a game , but a playground , " he says .
" It 's very much about virtual worlds , user - generated content and social networking . "
Yoick wants to " mash - up " the endearing qualities of successful internet ventures : the addictiveness and visual richness of World of Warcraft , the personal expression of MySpace and the mobility of internet phone service Skype .
" Outback Online is a virtual world system that will be on your computer 24/7 , and we do n't yet know what changes that 's going to bring , but we 've got an inkling that will be pretty profound , " Mr Leeb - du Toit says .
In the new world , an ' outback ' is equivalent to Second Life 's islands - a hub for users .
It 's an environment in which one can talk , build and play .
Yoick 's Phil Morle calls it " a huge box of Lego " .
You can develop private outbacks for friends or a concert for 5000 visitors .
The P2P architecture overcomes some obstacles that prevent such a gathering in Second Life but Mr Morle , a consultant who worked on Outback 's development , says the visual quality is greatly improved .
" Second Life has a low - res look to it whereas sometimes I just stand there in the rain and watch the sun go down in World of Warcraft because it is so beautiful , " he says .
" Our stuff is rich , 3 - D and graphically more like something you 'd see in World of Warcraft . "
Usability was also a focus .
" I want my kids to be able to design an experience in Outback , " Mr Morle says .
" They can't even figure out how to move in Second Life . "
With a release date of " sometime this year " , it will take a while to determine how Outback Online handles a million users an hour .
" It 's hard to say there will never be problems , " Mr Leeb - du Toit says .
" But the advantages of P2P versus a client - server ( system ) are huge . "
Mr Morle , the former Kazaa CTO , has assembled an expert team experienced in P2P applications that includes development director Marty Poulin , formerly online technology director at Disney 's Buena Vista Games .
" While I was at Kazaa it was a common conversation to dream up ways of using peer - to - peer in 3 - D worlds , " Mr Morle says .
But a P2P system suffers from a more complex network architecture - the peer with the information you need to update your scene may be firewalled .
And overcoming the lag with data queries will be a challenge - in multi-player gaming , milliseconds matter .
Outback promises fewer rules than other virtual worlds - which suffer from pedophiles ( MySpace ) and public sex ( Second Life ) - but better controls to shield children .
Second Life chairman Mitch Kapor reportedly claims virtual worlds are a " hundred billion dollar opportunity " .
With a Skype pricing model , Mr Leeb - du Toit says Outback Online will be free for the average user .
And there is a " strong possibility " of venture capital funding .
For now , they are still building the world of their dreams .
To be recognized as a neurotransmitter , a chemical compound must satisfy six conditions :
It must be
synthesized in the neuron , stored there , released in sufficient quantity to bring about some physical effect ; when administered experimentally , the compound must demonstrate the same effect that it brings about in living tissue ; there must be receptor sites specific to this compound on the postsynaptic membrane , as well as a means for shutting off its effect , either by causing its swift decomposition or by reuptake , absorbing it back into the cell .
A hormone , by definition , is a compound produced by an endocrine gland and released into the bloodstream where it can find it 's target cells at some distance from it 's actual site of release .
A neurotransmitter on the other hand is a compound released from a nerve terminal .
When an electrical impulse travels to the end of a nerve cell , it stimulates the terminal of this cell to secrete a chemical signalling molecule at a special junction between nerve cells called a synapse .
These nerve terminals are in direct apposition with their target cells to ensure rapid and specific delivery of the signal .
This mode of transmission is in general much faster than the endocrine transmission mentioned above .
Both target cells possess receptors for the signalling molecule and may produce identical biochemical responses , it 's just a question of the release mechanism that determines whether or not a given molecule is a neurotransmitter or a hormone .
So , in the case of adrenaline , it 's a hormone when the adrenal gland releases it into the bloodstream and it goes to the heart or the lungs OR it 's a neurotransmitter when it is released from a stimulated presynaptic nerve cell and acts on it's neighbouring postsynaptic cell .
In 1950 , a chemist at Rhône - Poulenc , a French pharmaceutical company , modified the structure of an antihistamine and accidentally created a drug that can eliminate the psychotic thinking of people with schizophrenia .
Within a few years the drug became world famous as chlorpromazine ( Thorazine ) , the first truly effective medication for a disabling mental disorder .
Because of its dramatic effect , chlorpromazine set a new course for psychiatry for the rest of the twentieth century .
The great success of chlorpromazine stimulated vigorous competition from other pharmaceutical companies .
In the 1950s , the search for more antipsychotic medications led to the accidental discovery of two other types of phsychiatric drugs .
First Geigy , a Swiss pharmaceutical company , came up with a modified version of one of its antihistamines that , although useless against psychosis , proved to be a valuable treatment for severe depression .
Named imipramine ( Tofranil ) , it paved the way for many contemporary antidepressants .
Then Hoffman - La Roche , another Swiss company , created chlordiazepoxide ( Librium ) , which does n’t help psychosis either but does relieve anxiety .
It was soon followed by another benzodiazepine , diazepam ( Valium ) , which became the best - selling drug in America for about a decade , beginning in the mid-1960s .
Adding to the excitement over these drugs were a flurry of findings about their effects on neurotransmitters , a class of brain chemicals that transmit signals between nerve cells .
By the 1970s it was discovered that chlorpromazine blocks certain actions of a neurotransmitter called dopamine ; imipramine augments the actions of several neurotransmitters , including norephinephrine and serotonin ; and diazepam amplifies the effects of yet another neurotransmitter , called gamma- aminobutyric acid [ GABA ] .
In each case , the net result is a change in signaling in brain circuits that control emotional aspects of behaviour .
These discoveries spurred a search for other chemicals that would have similar effects on neurotransmission but fewer undesirable side effects than the originals .
The search paid off in a stream of new medications that patients perfer .
The most famous , fluoxetine [ Prozac ] , was initially identified as a chemical that prolongs neurotransmission by serotonin ; it was subsequently shown to be an effective treatment for both severe and moderate depression .
Called an SSRI ( selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ) , it prolongs serotonin ’s effects by inhibiting its reuptake by the nerves that release it , which is the normal way that serortonin signaling is terminated .
Related drugs , including sertraline ( Zoloft ) , paroxetine ( Paxil ) , fluvoxamine ( Luvox ) , and citalopram ( Celexa ) soon followed .
Neutrotransmitters
Found a number of fascinating stories of how neurotransmitters were discovered and sketches of what these things do .
Acetylcholine :
As I 've mentioned previously , I 'm working on a framework for pushing events from an Erlang based web server to browser based clients using AJAX .
My goal being to make it look like normal Erlang message sends to ' processes ' running on the browser .
I have a server process that needs to broadcast events to interested parties whenever something of interest happens .
My first thought was that this is the classic Observer pattern in OO style frameworks .
I wanted other processes to be able to register with the server and they would then receive the notification .
They can then later unregister when no longer interested in the data .
This turns out to be very easy in Erlang .
A simple process to handle this looks something like :
notifier ( Observers ) -> receive {notify , Message} -> lists : foreach ( fun ( To ) ->
To !
Message end , Observers ) , notifier ( Observers ) ; {register , Observer} -> notifier ( [ Observer |Observers ] ) ; {unregister , Observer} -> notifier ( lists : delete ( Observer , Observers ) ) end .
Given a notifier , observers can register their interest in events .
A server then sends a ' notify ' message to the notifier , passing it the required data .
This is in turn sent to all currently registered observers .
So something like :
test ( ) -> receive X -> io :format ( " Received ~ p~n " , [ X ] ) , test ( ) end .
Changes = spawn ( module , notifier , [ [ ] ] ) .
Observer1 = spawn ( module , test , [ ] ) .
Changes !
{register , Observer1} .
Changes !
{notify , " Hello Message ! " }. ...observer1 will output ' Received Hello Message !'...
Changes !
{unregister , Observer1} .
Using code similar to this I created a notifier for my data source , and the observers are my HTML web pages .
This is easy since I 'm modelling each active page as a process .
When an event occurs , the HTML on all displayed web pages are updated immediately using the AJAX based server push .
Spyware - malicious programs that covertly track surfing habits or steal confidential data - are likely to migrate onto new platforms , including mobile phones and RFID chips .
The scenario is sketched out in the second issue of McAfee 's twice annual Global Threat Report .
RFID chips , which began life as a replacement for bar codes in retailing and warehousing , are now being integrated into some identification documents , such as passports , and in emerging technologies like contactless credit cards .
In January , SoMark Innovations announced the development of bio-compatible chipless RFID ink , making RFID " tattoos " and synthetic biometrics possible .
The British government plans to test RFID - embedded license plates , developed by Hills Numberplates .
Such e-plates might be read by any strategically placed reader along a road at speeds of up to 300 km / h and up to 100 metres away .
Applications include speed traps , detecting stolen vehicles , and traffic management .
Network security firm McAfee reckons that the technology also lends itself to its use as a surveillance tool by governments or criminal exploitation .
The growing , almost ubiquitous , use of RFID technology creates a platform for malware .
Research first presented in March 2006 shows how vulnerabilities in RFID technology might be used to spread viruses , worms , and spyware .
Dutch researchers showed how RFID tags could be virally infected through SQL injection attacks , exploiting links between an RFID tag and a vulnerable database .
Spy on the wire
The increasing processing power and growing features set of mobile phones make the devices an " ideal candidate " for exploitation by spyware , according to security researchers at McAfee .
Examples of this limited breed are capable of forwarding call logs to a remote server , recording and forwarding text messages , listening to calls , or even remotely turning the device into a live radio " bug " without the phone user 's knowledge or consent .
These applications hide or camouflage themselves once installed on mobile devices .
Sold as a means for suspicious partners to track the activities of their potentially errant spouses , applications such as FlexiSpy pose a wider threat to security , McAfee warns .
A lack of awareness among consumers about how to use Bluetooth securely also represents a serious security threat to mobile phone users such as Bluebugging , where an attacker manipulates a phone to dial numbers , and Bluestabbing , where an attacker tries to crash vulnerable devices .
Second Life
The second issue of McAfee 's twice annual Global Threat Report also looks at other security issues the industry is likely to face over the next five years .
McAfee continues to criticise the security shortcomings of Vista it first made prior to the release of what Microsoft describes as its " most secure " operating system ever .
" While Microsoft has taken steps to make the base of Microsoft Windows Vista more secure , the improvements both weaken third - party efforts to secure systems and do n't go far enough to do the job alone , " McAfee analysts argue .
The majority of cybercriminals target PC users , making money by selling access to compromise PCs to spammers , for example .
As technologies such as Voice over IP ( VoIP ) and radio frequency identifications ( RFID ) tags become more widely adopted , attackers are likely to branch out .
Security crystal ball gazers at McAfee also predict that application security will become a key battleground between hackers and security defenders over coming months and years .
Using disk encryption technologies to prevent stolen or purloined PCs giving up secrets will become " ubiquitous " in enterprises within five years , McAfee predicts .
The report also forecasts that online crime will " migrate " to mobile phones , something McAfee has been predicting since Bill Clinton and John Major were in power , with scant evidence to date .
More on all these threats to e-commerce can be found in McAfee 's report here . ®
Magic 8 - Ball Answers Your Questions Regarding Microsoft ’s ‘ Zune ’
Q : So Microsoft has confirmed that Zune , the “ iPod / iTunes killer ” project that Engadget has been reporting on for a few weeks , is for real .
It ’s a “ music and entertainment ” project that will involve portable players , an online media store , and desktop software for managing media and getting content from the store onto the players ; all of it integrated and all of it produced and sold exclusively by Microsoft themselves .
Does this sound familiar ?
A : YES — DEFINITELY .
Q : Have you seen the photo of the first Zune gadget “ leaked ” to Engadget ?
Seems , uh , a bit familiar , too , what with the white plastic and scroll wheel :
A : AS I SEE IT , YES .
Q : I mean , if this is even vaguely the form factor of the device they plan to ship , it ’s so shameless a rip - off that they might as well have called it the “ xPod ” or even the “ Ipod ” ( “ It ’s a totally different name — we have a capital ‘ I ’ , see ! ” ) .
The scroll wheel , the sparsity of buttons , the plain white facade .
But that “ Microsoft Designs the iPod Package ” video be damned , you just know there are executives at Microsoft dying to slap a logo on the front of this thing , right ?
A : ASK AGAIN LATER .
Q : Speaking of logos , what about the Zune logotype that ’s going around ?
With the magenta - to - orange gradient and weird overly - complicated Necker - cube - ish Z - shape mark ?
That ’s just temporary , right ?
A : CANNOT PREDICT NOW .
Q : According to Engadget , the Zune service and devices wo n’t just be separate from Microsoft ’s PlaysForSure platform , they ’ll be wholly incompatible with each other .
I ’ll bet that ’s just delightful news to all of Microsoft ’s “ PlaysForSure ” partners like Creative Labs and Napster .
A : YOU MAY RELY ON IT .
Q : But yet Engadget reports , “ Microsoft will continue to support and develop for their PlaysForSure initiative , but all things PlaysForSure are handled by [ an ] entirely separate division that will not have any crossover . ”
Is that not the epitome of metastatic corporate bureaucracy ?
One division within Microsoft spending $ 100 million or more to launch their own closed media player system ; another division charged with lining up “ partners ” for the PlaysForSure platform that Microsoft ’s own media player division deems not good enough .
A : YES .
Q : Is n’t that like inviting guests to your home for dinner and serving them hot dogs while you yourself eat a steak ?
A : AS I SEE IT , YES .
Q : And so now that Microsoft is abandoning the licensing model ( or at least deprecating it ) in favor of a closed model that they completely control , will all those pundits who ’ve been predicting doom for the iPod for the last four years declare that Microsoft , like Apple , is now making the same mistake with Zune that Apple made with the Macintosh in the 1980s ?
A : DON ’T COUNT ON IT .
Q : Jackasses .
A : WITHOUT A DOUBT .
Q : The “ leaks ” about Zune strike me as rather comically transparent .
The gist of their origin seems to be that Microsoft has been making the rounds to various “ partners ” — which in this case means the entertainment industry and iPod peripheral makers — to line up content and peripheral support for the Zune , and that it ’s these “ partners who ’ve been briefed by Microsoft ” who are leaking the details .
My guess is that it went something like this : some guy from Microsoft showed up , delivered his spiel , and then gave a big wink and said something like “ This is all top - secret stuff , so whatever you do , do n’t go and blab about all these details to Engadget and Gizmodo !
And for god ’s sake do n’t send them this photograph which I ’m emailing a copy of to each of you right now !
Can you see that I ’m winking ?
Winking is a social cue that you use when you say one thing but mean the opposite ! ”
A : IT IS DECIDEDLY SO .
Q : So in other words , this has all the hallmarks of a good old - fashioned Microsoft vaporware campaign : wildly optimistic ship date ( “ this November ” ) and a laundry list of features missing from the iPod and iTunes ( Wi - Fi , social networking , a video game mode , adjustable faceplates , and maybe even Sirius and / or XM satellite radio ) .
I ’ll bet it will ship on schedule , with all those features , and will be lightweight , thin , and get great battery life .
A : VERY DOUBTFUL .
Q : I was being sarcastic .
My point is that it ’s now late July , and despite the fact that there are leaked photos and a features list the length of your arm , no one has claimed to have actually seen a working prototype .
And some of these proposed features , like peer - to - peer file sharing and proximity - based recommendations , sound rather like a lot of work .
Do they honestly expect to have this on the shelves in time for Christmas ?
A : MY REPLY IS NO .
Q : So what they ’ve done is leak a November release date and a fantastic feature list — a feature list that the next batch of new iPods , no matter how cool , are unlikely to match — and hope that people will wait for the Zune .
And then even when it misses the holiday season and slips into 2007 , and wo n’t include all of the previously - promised features , they ’ll say it was n’t their fault ( despite the fact that the whole point of the Zune platform model is that Microsoft controls the entire system ) but that it ’ll be worth the wait anyway .
That sound right ?
A : SIGNS POINT TO YES .
Q : Seems funny to think that Microsoft went around to the entertainment companies with a message that , if you think about it , boils down to , “ So we hear that you ’re worried about the growing leverage that Apple is accumulating in the digital media space , and that you ’re looking for a partner who can be trusted not to use such an advantage unfairly or to bludgeon competitors .
How about Microsoft ? ”
A : YES — DEFINITELY .
Q : As for “ Coming Zune ” , Microsoft ’s ostensibly “ viral ” teaser site featuring an animated guy stroking a bunny rabbit while a six - inch - tall man moves in for a hug — well , the less said the better .
A : MOST LIKELY .
Q : Back to the form factor .
Again , presuming this is really what the thing looks like , it seems almost comical that Microsoft is so clearly mimicking the look of the current iPods .
The best they can do with such a design strategy is to approach the coolness of the current iPods ; whereas Apple itself is always at work on new designs that make their own current ones look dated .
Sure , there are all sorts of innovative new features supposedly slated for the Zune , but if people look at it and their initial reaction is “ Oh , it ’s an iPod rip - off , ” that ’s a pretty crummy first impression .
Does anyone at Microsoft realize that rip - offs are n’t considered cool ?
A : MY SOURCES SAY NO .
Q : Then again , Pablo Picasso said , “ Good artists copy .
Great artists steal . ”
By that standard the people on the Zune team must be a bunch of Michelangelos , eh ?
A : CONCENTRATE AND ASK AGAIN .
Q : As for Apple , well , Steve Jobs is a big fan of that Picasso quote .
My guess is they ’ve been expecting this , that Apple expects their competitors , especially Microsoft , to copy everything they do , and that thus the only thing they find surprising about Zune is that it ’s taken this long for Microsoft to attempt to copy the entire iPod / iTunes / ITMS troika .
Agree ?
A : WITHOUT A DOUBT .
Q : But Microsoft does have one genuine ace in the hole : their mountain of cash .
They ca n’t buy taste , but they can burn money .
One of their rumored features is an ITMS converter , where the Zune desktop app will go through your iTunes music library and look for songs purchased through the ITMS , and they ’ll give you “ free ” versions of those same songs from the Zune music store , and Microsoft will just pick up the tab with the record labels .
That ’s actually a pretty clever idea , is n’t it ?
A : REPLY HAZY , TRY AGAIN .
Q : Microsoft ’s rumored “ we ’ll just buy them another copy of every song they bought from ITMS ” feature — pretty clever , is n’t it ?
A : IT IS CERTAIN .
Q : And hardware - wise , if they ’re really serious about this , they ’ll do what they ’ve done with the Xbox : cram $ 800 worth of components into a $ 400 box and lose hundreds of dollars on each unit sold .
There ’s something perverse about the fact that the only recent brand - new product from Microsoft that ’s considered a success is the Xbox , which according to Forbes lost $ 4 billion from 2001 - 2005 .
That ’s enough money to sink most companies , but it was just a small slice of Microsoft ’s cash hoard .
A similar strategy with the Zune would prove difficult for Apple to follow , would it not ?
A : MOST LIKELY .
Q : On the other hand , although the Xbox 360 is slicker than the original Xbox , it ’s still bigger , clunkier , hotter , and louder ( fan- wise ) than the PS2 and GameCube .
Those traits are OK for a game console that goes in your entertainment center , but they ’re not OK for a portable media player that goes in your pocket .
If their $ 60 billion bank account has n’t yet helped Microsoft develop a penchant for the simplicity / clarity / elegance thing , it never will , will it ?
A : OUTLOOK NOT SO GOOD .
Q : Should I even bother asking whether Zune will work on the Mac ?
A : BETTER NOT TELL YOU NOW .

Childhood obesity can signal problems in later life
Super - sized vehicles have been introduced and new air ambulances will be remodelled to carry heavier people .
Studies estimate that 67 % of Australian men and over half of all women aged over 25 are overweight or obese .
So many Australians are now bulging at the waistline that ambulances are being equipped with heavy - duty stretchers .
These are capable of carrying patients weighing up to 220 kg ( 34 st 9 lbs ) .
In the country 's most populous state , New South Wales , officials have said that more super - sized ambulances may well be needed to cope with this health crisis .
Special vehicles with over - sized wheelchairs and a hydraulic tailgate were introduced a few years ago to transport larger people .
Their workload has doubled since 2004 .
Obese toddlers
Dealing with the obese or overweight is becoming more common for medical teams and it can be an arduous experience .
In a recent case in Sydney it took 16 people several hours to take an injured man from his home to hospital .
He weighed about 400 kg ( 63 st ) and had broken his leg .
Emergency workers had to demolish part of his house to lift him out .
There are strong signs that Australia 's obesity epidemic is getting worse .
A lack of exercise and a poor diet , including drinks loaded with sugar and high - fat snacks , are breeding a new generation of fat Australians .
Experts here are warning that by 2030 half of this country 's children will be overweight or obese .
They have insisted that breast and colon cancer as well as diabetes and heart disease have strong links to obesity .
It is reported that some Australian hospitals are now treating obese patients who are as young as two years old .

The cloak is constructed from advanced " metamaterials "
The device mostly hid a small copper cylinder from microwaves in tests at Duke University , North Carolina .
It works by deflecting the microwaves around the object and restoring them on the other side , as if they had passed through empty space .
But making an object vanish before a person 's eyes is still the stuff of science fiction - for now .
We 've opened the door into the secret garden
Prof John Pendry , Imperial College London
Like visible light waves , microwaves bounce off objects , making them apparent and creating a shadow .
But at microwave frequencies , the detection has to be made by instruments rather than the naked eye .
New chapter
Water behaves differently .
When water in a river flows around a smooth rock , the water closes up on the opposite side .
Someone looking at the water downstream would never guess it had passed around an obstacle .
The metamaterial cloak channelled the microwaves around the object like water flows around the rock .
Scientists were able to watch waves bending around the cloak
In the experiment , the scientists first measured microwaves travelling across a plane of view with no obstacles .
Then they placed a copper cylinder in the same plane and measured the disturbance , or scattering , in the microwaves .
Next , the researchers placed the invisibility cloak over the copper cylinder .
The cloak did not completely iron out the disturbance , but it greatly reduced the microwaves being blocked or deflected .
Hidden from view
" This cloak guides electromagnetic waves around a central region so that any object at all can be placed in that region and will not disturb the electromagnetic fields , " explained co-author Dr David Schurig from Duke University .
" There is reduced reflection from the object , and there is also reduced shadow . "
In principle , the same theoretical blueprint could be used to cloak objects from visible light .
But this would require much more intricate and tiny metamaterial structures , which scientists have yet to devise .
" As an application , it 's not clear that you 're going to get the invisibility that everyone thinks about - as in Harry Potter 's cloak , or the Star Trek cloaking device , " said Professor David R Smith of Duke .
Broad applications
John Pendry commented : " There 's a rule about the internal structure of the metamaterial : it has to be smaller than the wavelength of radiation .
So for radar waves that 's 3 cm .
You can easily engineer something a few millimetres across .
" You go up to optical radiation - visible light - and the wavelength is less than a micron .
So your microstructure has to be a few tens of nanometres across .
and we 're only just learning how to do nanotechnology ... maybe in five or 10 years ' time you could do this , but not today . "
The researchers say that if an object can be hidden from microwaves , it can be hidden from radar - a possibility that will ensure interest from the military .
Professor Pendry said a metamaterial cloak could be manufactured to wrap around a fighter plane or tank .
But , he said : " You must n't demand that the cloak be too thin .
Despite the hype around Harry Potter , this is n't anything that flaps around in the breeze ; it 's more like a shed . "
It could be used to hide objects from terahertz waves , a regime that is being exploited for numerous sensing technologies , or even from mobile phone frequencies and magnetic fields .

結論オリエンテッドな議論
1 ．
最近、議論せずとも異論をぶつけてくる相手の考え方が理解できる（ような気分である）と書いたところ、「そのコツを教えてほしい」と要望が寄せられました。以下、回答いたします。
結論オリエンテッド（結論第一主義、結論志向）という考え方を理解することが、唯一最大のポイントです。
2 ．
誰の主張に対してであれ、明確にNOを突きつける人は、立場のハッキリした人だといえます。従来、こうした相手の考え方を理解するために発せられてきた言葉は「なぜ、そう考えるのか?」でした。相手の主張の背景には「理由」や「根拠」があるはずだ、というわけです。
しかし結果はどうだったでしょうか?
要求に応じて提示された論拠をていねいに潰していっても、相手の主張の根幹はブレないことが多かったはずです。「でも、でも」といっそう意地を張り、ますます手がつけられなくなっていった記憶、皆様にもあろうかと思います。
逆に、枝葉末節にこだわりネチネチと言葉尻をあげつらう論敵に暗い炎を燃やした経験もあるでしょう。補論を重ね持論の正当性をあらためて確認しているこちらを嘲笑うがごとく、「論破されているのに見苦しい」……それはこちらの台詞だ、といいたい。決め付け、悪意の解釈、ワザとやってるだろう、この嫌がらせ。
こうして最初は紳士的に始まった議論も、延々と続く限りは内面のドロドロ化を避け難い。なぜか?
それは、人々が 「結論オリエンテッドな議論」をしているからです。（……と「考える」ことで疑問は解消されます）
3 ．
「 事実」を共有できても、「価値観」が異なれば解釈は違うものとなります。意見対立は究極的に解決され得ないケースが多い、と見てきました。
多くの人が説得の第一歩として、相手が反対する「理由」を訊ねるのは、同じ人間として根源的な価値観は共有されていることを信じているからです。そしてゼロ地点からひとつずつ議論を積み上げていけば、結論を共有できるはずだと思っているのです。
しかし現実には、議論を掘り下げていっても「価値観」はなかなか見えてこないのでした。手強い反論があればアッサリと諦め、別の手を繰り出してくる。これではタコの足切りです。本当の足はどこにあるんだ?
そして私は気付きました。そうか、タコの足は頭から生えてくるんだ。相手が絶対に守りたいもの、彼／彼女の価値観、ひいては人格を体現しているのは、この議論の「結論」だったんだ、と。
4 ．
多くの人は、たいていの問題について、自らの立場を持っていません。まず「無関心」、次に「よくわからない」、続いて「どちらともいえない」ときて、ようやく「賛成」とか「反対」などということになります。こうした人々は、ふつう、紆余曲折を経てようやく自分の意見を定めても、それは当座の在所に過ぎません。ちょっとしたことでまた根無し草となってゆらゆらと曖昧の海に泳ぎだします。
そうなる原因は、各人の持つ価値観と、現実の諸問題とが遠いことです。
平和な社会を望む、といった漠たる要求と、だから靖国神社に首相が参拝すべきとかすべきでないといったテーマは、たいていの人の頭の中で、まっすぐには結びつきません。遠い遠い道のりを歩く間に、あっちから誘われ、こっちの声を聞き、そうしてようやく現在地点にたどり着くわけです。頭の中に賛成・反対、両方の材料があって判断保留の状態。
「 ハイ、あなたの意見をどうぞ」そんなこといわれても困るのです。あるいは、仮に「賛成」側に身を置いたとしても、それは現状のバランスを前提とした結論。「反対」側の情報（反論）にたくさん接してみれば、途端に気持ちがグラつきます。
そんなわけで、ほとんどの人はほとんどの問題について議論を忌避します。動機もなければコストの負担を肩代わりしてくれる存在もないのですから。
「 理由オリエンテッドな議論」は、知的好奇心にあふれる人同士の幸運な出会いなくして継続不可能です。また多くの人の持つ「価値観」はたいてい深い深い階層にあり、高度に抽象化されているので、滅多なことでは激突しません。したがって多くの意見交換は対話のレベルで極めて短期間に処理されます。
こうした日常体験のために、人々は「結論オリエンテッドな議論」というイレギュラーへの対応を誤るのです。
5 ．
いくつか 「なぜ」を遡ってから「これ以上は問答無用」というケースと、最初から「門前払い」するケースとの間に、本質的な差異はありません。倫理は倫理でしか説明できず、世界から倫理を取り出す最初の一歩は、無根拠な断言でしかありえないのです。
様々な議論を眺めてみた経験からいえば、「なぜ」を突き詰めてスタート地点に辿りつくのは稀です。2～4階層掘って満足される方が多いようですが、疲れたか飽きたか。何もかも曖昧なままです。その点、
最初から「門前払い」するケース 即ち結論オリエンテッドな議論は、明快です。
以上より、冒頭の質問に回答します。
議論せず（＝説明を求めず）に異論を理解するコツは、理由ではなく結論に着目し、素直にそのまま受け止めることです。泥沼の議論を読み解くコツも、同様です。人は結論オリエンテッドに発言し、議論すると「みなす」。この発想の転換が、閉塞感を打破します。

注意書き
For the past nine days my inbox has been filling up with messages labelled " Your scam exposed " , " The great fraud unravels " and " How do you feel now , asshole ? " .
They are referring to a new " scientific paper " , which proves that the " climate change scare " is a tale " worthier of St John the Divine than of science " .
Published in two parts on consecutive Sundays , it runs to a total of 52 pages , containing graphs , tables and references .
To my correspondents , to a good many journalists and to thousands of delighted bloggers , this paper clinches it : climate change is a hoax perpetrated by a leftwing conspiracy coordinated by the United Nations .
So which was the august journal that published it ?
Science ?
Nature ?
Geophysical Research Letters ?
Not quite .
It was the Sunday Telegraph .
In keeping with most of the articles about climate change in that publication , it is a mixture of cherry - picking , downright misrepresentation and pseudo - scientific gibberish .
But it has the virtue of being incomprehensible to anyone who is not an atmospheric physicist .
The author of this " research article " is Christopher Monckton , otherwise known as Viscount Monckton of Brenchley .
He has a degree in classics and a diploma in journalism and , as far as I can tell , no further qualifications .
But he is confident enough to maintain that - by contrast to all those charlatans and amateurs who wrote the reports produced by the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change - he is publishing " the truth " .
The warming effects of carbon dioxide , Lord Monckton claims , have been exaggerated , distorted and made up altogether .
One example of the outrageous fraud the UN body has committed is the elimination from its temperature graphs of the " medieval warm period " , which , he claims , was " real , global and up to 3C warmer than now " .
He runs two graphs side by side , one of which shows the temperature record over the past 1,000 years as rendered by the UN panel , and the other purporting to show real temperatures over the same period .
The world was so hot 600 years ago , he maintains , that " there was little ice at the North Pole : a Chinese naval squadron sailed right round the Arctic in 1421 and found none " .
By contrast the planet is currently much cooler than climate scientists predicted .
In 1988 , for example , the world 's most celebrated climatologist , James Hansen of Nasa , " told the US Congress that temperature would rise 0.3C by the end of the century ( it rose 0.1C ) , and that sea level would rise several feet ( no , one inch ) " .
Most importantly , " the UN repealed a fundamental physical law " , doubling the size of the constant ( lambda ) in the Stefan - Boltzmann equation .
By assigning the wrong value to lambda , the UN 's panel has exaggerated the sensitivity of the climate to extra carbon dioxide .
Monckton 's analysis looks impressive .
It is nonsense from start to finish .
His claims about the Stefan - Boltzmann equation have been addressed by someone who does know what he 's talking about , Dr Gavin Schmidt of Nasa 's Goddard Institute for Space Studies .
He begins by pointing out that Stefan - Boltzmann is a description of radiation from a " black body " - an idealised planet that absorbs all the electromagnetic radiation that reaches it .
The Earth is not a black body .
It reflects some of the radiation it receives back into space .
Schmidt points out that Monckton also forgets , in making his calculations , that " climate sensitivity is an equilibrium concept " : in other words that there is a time - lag of several decades between the release of carbon dioxide and the eventual temperature rise it causes .
If you do n't take this into account , the climate 's sensitivity to carbon dioxide looks much smaller .
This is about as fundamental a mistake as you can make in climate science .
What of his other claims ?
Well , the reason the " medieval warm period " does n't show up on the UN panel 's graphs is simple .
As far as climatologists can tell , there was n't one .
So why did the Vikings , as Monckton points out , settle in Greenland ?
As a paper published in Reviews of Geophysics shows , Vikings first arrived in Greenland at the very beginning of the " warm period " Monckton discusses , when temperatures , even according to his graph , were lower than they are today .
They did so because life had become too hot for them in their adopted home ( Iceland ) : not climatically , but politically .
There does appear to have been a slight warming in some parts of the northern hemisphere .
There is no reliable evidence that this was a global phenomenon .
As for the Chinese naval squadron sailing round the Arctic , it is pure bunkum - a myth long discredited by serious historians .
So what of those graphs ?
Look at them carefully and you see that they are measuring two different things : global temperatures ( the UN panel 's progression ) and European temperatures ( Monckton 's line ) .
You will also discover that the scales are different .
As for James Hansen , he did not tell the US Congress that temperatures would rise by 0.3C by the end of the past century .
He presented three possible scenarios to the US Senate - high , medium and low .
Both the high and low scenarios , he explained , were unlikely to materialise .
The middle one was " the most plausible " .
As it happens , the middle scenario was almost exactly right .
He did not claim , under any scenario , that sea levels would rise by several feet by 2000 .
But a climatologist called Patrick Michaels took the graph from Hansen 's paper , erased the medium and low scenarios and - in testimony to Congress - presented the high curve as Hansen 's prediction for climate change .
A memo sent in July from the Intermountain Rural Electric Association , a US company whose power is largely supplied by coal , revealed that Michaels has long been funded by electricity companies .
" In February this year , IREA alone contributed $ 100,000 to Dr Michaels . "
Michaels , it says , meets periodically with industry representatives to discuss their activities in countering stories about climate change .
Pat Michaels 's misrepresentation of Hansen 's claims was picked up by Michael Crichton in his novel State of Fear , and somehow transmuted into an " error " of 300 % .
Monckton gives no source for his claim about Hansen , but Crichton 's novel features in his references .
The howlers go on and on .
There is scarcely a line in Lord Monckton 's paper which is not wildly wrong .
Yet none of this appears to embarrass the Sunday Telegraph , which championed his findings this week in a leading article .
I think I know what the problem is .
At a meeting of 150 senior journalists last year , who had gathered to discuss climate change , the chairman asked how many people in the audience had a science degree .
Three of us raised our hands .
Readers cannot expect a newspaper editor to possess a detailed understanding of atmospheric physics , but there should at least be someone who knows what science looks like whom the editor consults before running a piece .
A scientific paper is one published in a peer - reviewed scientific journal .
This means it has been subject to scrutiny by other experts in the field .
This does n't suggest that it 's the last word on the subject , but it does mean it is worth discussing .
For newspapers such as the Sunday Telegraph the test seems to be much simpler .
If they do n't understand it , it must be science .

We addressed the ques­tion Is phys­i­cal fit­ness impor­tant to your brain fit­ness ?
recent­ly :
Accord­ing to Fred Gage , PhD , of the Salk Insti­tute for Bio­log­i­cal Stud­ies , “ We now know that exer­cise helps gen­er­ate new brain cells , even in the aging brain .
Accord­ing to the research of Richard Smeyne , PhD at Saint Jude Chil­dren ’s Research Hos­pi­tal in Mem­phis , with just two months of exer­cise there are more brain cells and that high­er lev­els of exer­cise were sig­nif­i­cant­ly more ben­e­fi­cial than low­er amounts , although any exer­cise was bet­ter than none .
He also found that start­ing an exer­cise pro­gram ear­ly in life to be an effec­tive way to low­er the risk of devel­op­ing Parkin­son ’s dis­ease lat­er in life .
As lit­tle as three hours a week of brisk walk­ing has been shown to halt , and even reverse , the brain shrink­age that starts in a per­son­ ’s 40s , espe­cial­ly in the regions respon­si­ble for mem­o­ry and high­er cog­ni­tion .

Dr. Kramer said “ After only three months , the peo­ple who exer­cised had the brain vol­umes of peo­ple three years younger .

Sometimes I 've seen the U.S. media take the simplistic view that " democracy " is the answer to all of a country 's problems .
I often chuckle to myself when I notice that in many cases the term " democracy " when used by the American press is really a euphemism for an American friendly government and way of life .
This is one of the reasons why I am unsurprised by the inherent contradiction in stories like Bush Says U.S. Wo n't Deal With Hamas which is excerpted below
Stunned by Hamas ' decisive election victory , President Bush said Thursday the United States will not deal with the militant Palestinian group as long as it seeks Israel 's destruction .
" If your platform is the destruction of Israel it means you 're not a partner in peace , " the president said .
" And we 're interested in peace . "
He urged Hamas to reverse course .
Hamas has taken responsibility for dozens of suicide attacks on Israel over the past five years but has largely observed a cease - fire since the election of Fatah leader Mahmoud Abbas as Palestinian president last year .
Bush left open the possibility of cutting off U.S. aid to the Palestinians .
He called on Abbas , a U.S. ally , to remain in office despite Fatah 's defeat by Hamas in parliamentary elections .
Abbas , elected separately a year ago , said he was committed to negotiations with Israel and suggested talks would be conducted through the Palestine Liberation Organization , a possible way around a Hamas - led government .
I guess that 's one way of to finding out what the U.S. government really thinks about exporting democracy .
American foreign policy has always been about supporting governments which support its policies regardless of whether they are democracies or brutal dictatorships .
Heck , just a few months before the events of September 11 , 2001 the United States government gave aid to the Taliban because they took a hard line position in the war on drugs .
Lots of people talk about democracy without really understanding what it means .
Spreading democracy is n't about making the more places share American culture , it 's about giving people the freedom to choose their way of life .
The hard part for the U.S. government is that sometimes their choices will be different from the ones Americans would like them to make .
Homo aspergerus : Evolution Stumbles Forward
by Gary Westfahl
As publicity about the condition has increased in recent years , I have gradually come to the conclusion that I have suffered all my life from an undiagnosed case of Asperger 's Syndrome  although , as will be explained , I do n't think that " suffered " is the proper term .
Certainly , I have always displayed the standard symptoms , including a persistent failure to establish eye contact , visible discomfort in most social situations , obsessive interests in a few subjects , a tendency to fall into routines that I am reluctant to abandon , and a tangible aura of emotional detachment , even in extreme situations .
For decades , I accepted what well - meaning friends and the self - help books incessantly preached  that I had simply picked up some bad habits which I could overcome with determination and practice  but I now recognize that these inclinations are part of my fundamental identity .
I am what I am , and I can no longer listen patiently to purportedly helpful pep talks along the lines of " All you have to do , Gary , is maintain eye contact and smile a lot and make small talk , and you 'll get along fine . "
In reality , offering me such comments is like telling a gay man , " Now , I 'm sure if you just tried a little harder , you could learn to like girls . "
However , in being someone with Asperger 's Syndrome who is devoted to science fiction , I am hardly alone .
Surfing the Internet brings to light numerous observations that science fiction fans frequently exhibit all the traits of Asperger 's Syndrome ; a recent autobiography by one man with the condition , Will Hadcroft 's The Feeling 's Unmutual : Growing Up with Asperger Syndrome ( Undiagnosed ) ( 2004 ) , describes his youthful fascination with science fiction and fantasy ; and a book designed to comfort children with Asperger 's Syndrome , Kathy Hoopmann 's Of Mice and Aliens : An Asperger Adventure ( 2001 ) , describes a boy with the condition who meets a newly arrived space alien and compares the boy 's problems in adjusting to his world with the alien 's problems in adjusting to life on Earth .
All explicit links between science fiction and Asperger 's Syndrome will necessarily be recent , because the condition  although first identified by Austrian doctor Hans Asperger in the 1940s  was not named until 1981 and was not accepted by the medical community until the 1990s ; but there seems little doubt that Asperger 's Syndrome has been around for a long time , and some have theorized that a wide variety of historical figures , including as Isaac Newton , Ludwig van Beethoven , Jane Austen , Alexander Graham Bell , and Albert Einstein , had Asperger 's Syndrome .
Still , there are reasons to believe that the condition became more and more common during the twentieth century  perhaps uncoincidentally , also the century that saw the emergence of the genre of science fiction .
Looking back at the science fiction of the 1930s pulp magazines , filled with lonely adventurers on solitary quests to distant planets and the far future , one can easily see how these stories would appeal to those young men ( and some young women ) , then regarded only as " reclusive " or " eccentric , " who we would now classify as undiagnosed cases of Asperger 's Syndrome .
As I can testify , a person with this condition always feels like an alien being in an alien world : why are all these people able to relax and have fun at this party while I am feeling so uneasy and uncomfortable ?
Why am I so different from everybody else ?
Indeed , while one typically believes that people turn to science fiction in search of colorfully unusual vicarious experiences , an entirely different set of motives often may be in play : to a teenager in the 1930s with Asperger 's Syndrome , a story about an astronaut encountering aliens on Mars might have had an air of comforting familiarity , in contrast to stories set in the bizarre , inexplicable , and thoroughly socialized worlds of Andy Hardy and the Bobbsey Twins .
Since that time , as I have argued elsewhere , science fiction has increasingly attracted more conventional , well - adjusted people , and the literature has correspondingly adjusted to place a greater emphasis on conventional , well - adjusted characters who happily function in social situations .
( To get a sense of how the literature has changed , one might contrast Alvin 's solitary journey through a mostly deserted universe in Arthur C. Clarke 's Against the Fall of Night [ 1948 ] with the overpopulated cosmos of various humans and aliens jostling against each other in Gregory Benford 's 1989 sequel , Beyond the Fall of Night . )
Still , even as the lonely , maladjusted hero grew less prominent in science fiction stories and figured more in comic books and video games , the link between science fiction and Asperger 's Syndrome has remained strong .
To this day , although observers might be incredulous to hear it , science fiction conventions represent my most enjoyable social experiences .
There , I feel accepted as what I am ; as in no other place , I can stand by myself or walk silently through the corridors , contentedly watching my surroundings , without any sense that I am out of the ordinary or that I am violating existing social norms ; except for longtime friends , no one approaches me to make small talk and nobody seems disturbed because I am not joining their conversations .
More so than any other community , the world of science fiction has always understood Asperger 's Syndrome , long before the term was devised , and it has always been open to people with that condition .
The rest of the world , unfortunately , has never understood and has never been open to people with Asperger 's Syndrome .
Labeled as a form of autism , or severe detachment from the world , it is  as a matter of medical definition  a damaging affliction .
And unquestionably , having Asperger 's Syndrome has had adverse effects on my life .
Being a loner drove me away from the career I once dreamed of  as a keyboard player and songwriter in a rock band  although I later found fulfillment as a scholar and writer , avocations that required far less social contact .
I make horrible first impressions , and I am rarely able to establish valuable contacts with the influential people I encounter .
Moreover , as someone called " the World 's Worst Interview " by one of my graduate school professors , I have regularly interviewed for desirable positions and have regularly failed to obtain them , passed over in favor of less qualified people who undoubtedly displayed more charm and personal appeal .
Still , I will leave it to somebody else to file the Mother of All Lawsuits alleging blatant discrimination in hiring and promotions illegally based upon the recognized disability of Asperger 's Syndrome  because , as already indicated , I do not feel like a victim at all .
Indeed , I am now prepared to argue that Asperger 's Syndrome should not be regarded as a handicap or as a debilitating condition ; rather , it is a tremendous asset , a set of beneficial traits that may someday be recognized as the characteristics of a new , and superior , form of humanity .
In mounting this argument , as I am uncomfortably aware , I am recalling the views of the infamous Claude Degler , who announced to the science fiction community of the 1940s that " fans are slans " : readers of science fiction , as evidenced by their high intelligence and keen interest in science fiction , are the early representatives of an emerging new species , homo superior , destined to overcome and supplant those merely human persons who do not like science fiction .
( For some contemporary readers , I suppose I must explain that " slans , " as depicted in A. E. van Vogt 's 1940 novel Slan , are a race of hyperintelligent mutants with psychic powers who live among , and are persecuted by , " normal " human beings .}
Much about Degler 's life remains mysterious , but it seems that whenever he was not traveling across the country expressing these opinions to any fans he encountered , he was confined at a mental institution , and many who listened to him would probably agree it was exactly where he belonged .
However , people with Asperger 's Syndrome do not think the way the rest of the world thinks , and they do not care what the rest of the world thinks , and hence they may discern hidden truths in the ravings of a lunatic , and they may have no qualms about expressing such views .
So , why on earth might it be advantageous to suffer from Asperger 's Syndrome ?
Consider , first of all , the fact that valuable new ideas and worthwhile artistic creations are always invariably the products of one individual mind .
True , people depend upon , and are enriched by , the accomplishments of their predecessors and colleagues ; but progress usually requires one person who can think outside the box , extend concepts into unexpected new realms , and develop new ways of looking at the world .
Even in an overcrowded world that increasingly celebrates " teamwork " as the ultimate human virtue , we have observed in this century remarkable individuals whose novel ideas sparked revolutions in fields ranging from mathematics and physics to music and art .
( It is strange and irksome that science fiction , employing a false analogy to the way that individual cells united to form multicellular organisms , so frequently posits that combining many individual intelligences into one group intelligence would represent tremendous progress  despite the fact that all of our experience with corporate thinking suggests exactly the opposite . )
In the past , solitude was a regular , and inevitable , aspect of human life .
While traveling , working , or staying at home while others worked , most people were necessarily alone for long periods of time .
Even the most compulsively sociable people often had the option of connecting with other humans only by means of reading , an activity that lends itself to pauses for extended contemplation , and they were otherwise forced to think by themselves , and hence to think for themselves .
All of this began to change in the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries , when new forms of technology gave people more and more ways to stay in touch with the world .
Two new forms of entertainment in the home , radio and television , demanded one 's constant attention more insistently than books , and the interactive communication system of the telephone  and for a few , walkie - talkies and ham radio  made it easy for solitary individuals to spend hours talking with other people who were far away .
The computer age brought even more ways to connect with others over long distances  e-mail , chat rooms , instant messaging , websites , blogs  and there has also emerged the ultimate facilitator of 24/7 contact with friends and family members , the cell phone .
Today , if somebody chooses  and many people do so choose  they can spend virtually every waking moment intently connected to other human voices .
I observe the results of this new technology every day at the university campus where I work .
The instant they step out of class , most students take out their cell phones and walk to their next destination engaged in constant chatter , or they put on their headphones to listen to their favorite songs , or they sit down with their laptops to surf the Net and check their e-mail .
They never want to be alone , and they never have to be alone .
And I pity them ; for , if you incessantly listen to what the rest of the world thinks , you will always think precisely the way the rest of the world thinks .
It is not surprising that these students so often report that they have trouble coming up with ideas for their term papers ; and when they move on into their adult careers , one wonders how frequently they will be enriching their professions with novel approaches and exciting new innovations .
In this new era , then , those with a natural inclination to avoid others and the world around them will have an advantage .
People with Asperger 's Syndrome do n't want to have cell phones ; they do n't want to be constantly disturbed by other people .
Unlike naturally sociable people who will feel compelled to take advantage of the many forms of communication now available , they will naturally prefer to eschew them .
They may still prefer reading to watching movies or television .
They may love to take long walks through natural settings , spending hours and hours comfortably alone with their own thoughts .
Thus , with everyone else 's minds incessantly connected to the zeitgeist of contemporary civilization , those with Asperger 's Syndrome will become the people most likely to come up with brilliant new ideas , to create memorably distinctive works of art , to develop entirely new ways of looking at the world .
Still , one might argue , they will remain at a disadvantage , because simply coming up with brilliant new ideas has never ensured that a person will have an effect on society .
Other people must be persuaded that the new ideas are valuable and merit some attention ; other people must examine , test , improve , augment , and fully develop the new ideas before they can be effectively implemented ; and all of these necessary processes will require social interactions and cooperative endeavors involving many other people .
While social skills may be a hindrance to the process of generating new ideas , then , it might seem that they remain essential to the process of promulgating and perfecting those ideas .
Long ago , however , science fiction fandom addressed and solved this problem .
While the emerging science fiction community did involve some forms of personal contact  regular meetings of local clubs and annual conventions that attracted fans from all over the world  the primary instrument of fan communication was the fanzine , a self - published amateur magazine that virtually anyone could produce all by themselves and mail from their homes .
While voluntarily staying alone as was often their preference , fans could still spread their ideas and influence other people by publishing , editing , and writing for fanzines , while writing lengthy letters was a common strategy for staying in touch with other individuals .
Even professional magazine editors might work in virtual isolation , the most famous example being H. L. Gold , whose notorious " agoraphobia " might be better diagnosed today as a form of Asperger 's Syndrome .
Further , while many science fiction writers have seemed eminently sociable , there have also been some famously reclusive writers , ranging from H. P. Lovecraft to Greg Egan , who have communicated with the science fiction community almost exclusively through their publications and correspondence , possibly due to their Asperger 's Syndrome .
And , as Benford and others have argued , science fiction fandom was the most significant precursor to today 's Internet  a vaster and more flexible instrument that allows people without social skills to interact with , and have an impact on , the world around them .
People with Asperger 's Syndrome can contentedly isolate themselves to come up with new ideas , and then , when the time comes to spread those ideas or collaboratively improve those ideas , they can turn to the Internet and achieve those goals without leaving their homes or coming into physical contact with other people .
Scholars can develop good working partnerships with other scholars all over the world without ever meeting them ; commentators can convey their viewpoints to innumerable people by means of their blogs without ever seeing them .
And in other ways , technological advances are eliminating any need for social interaction .
As noted , I drifted away from playing the piano and writing songs because I did not enjoy interacting with other musicians in a band ; but today , with a keyboard hooked up to the right software , I could be my own one - man band , replicating and blending the sounds of several instruments to produce a professional - quality CD .
We are moving toward a world , in other words , where Asperger 's Syndrome will no longer be a liability , and instead will become only an asset .
Granted , this argument might be dismissed as the self - serving delusions of a person who admits that he suffers from a recognized form of mental illness .
And I can think sufficiently out of the box to recognize this as a real possibility .
Perhaps social interactions and personal contact will forever remain vital elements in the human experience , and perhaps the people ill - suited to such encounters will forever remain marginalized outcasts .
Perhaps , however , I am right .
Perhaps , in a world where personal interactions become less and less important , those smiling , charismatic people who once rose effortlessly to the top of the ladder will find that their social skills have become obsolete , as employers no longer care about charm and instead would rather hire , and work from a distance with , people who manifest a strong ability to innovate and blaze new trails .
Perhaps , a desire to constantly see and talk with other people will increasingly be viewed as a harmful atavism , as more and more people exhibit the traits of Asperger 's Syndrome and benefit from voluntarily isolating themselves most of the time .
Perhaps , as advanced forms of artificial intelligence become significant participants in the human community , people who long for human contact will be disadvantaged while people with Asperger 's Syndrome  who traditionally preferred the company of machines to the company of people anyway  will get along just fine .
Perhaps , instead of science fiction 's Homo superior , the dominant new form of humanity in the future will be the unanticipated Homo aspergerus .
Perhaps , then , we will someday live in the world of E. M. Forster 's " The Machine Stops " ( 1909 ) , where people live out their entire lives in enclosed individual chambers while they virtually interact with other people and machines when and to the extent that they choose  and as I have stated elsewhere , I would , unlike Forster , regard such a world as more utopian than dystopian .
Whether people with Asperger 's Syndrome are pitiable victims or the vanguards of a new human species , of course , remains to be seen .
But one thing is already evident : today , there exist growing numbers of people in our society who cannot and do not conform to conventional expectations regarding sociable human behavior .
I can hope that the world will soon adopt the tolerant attitudes long found in the science fiction community and embrace these odd people as loyal friends and capable workers , but that is something I cannot control .
What I can control , however , is my own life .
And let me tell you , I 'm tired of trying to pass for human , and I will no longer apologize for being what I am .
So , I say this to the world : I am uneasy in social situations and I communicate that unease ; I do n't like to maintain eye contact ; I always seem emotionally distant and detached .
Please deal with it .
If people do n't like the way I am , then all one can say is that they 're prejudiced , and that 's their problem , it is n't mine .
Do I suddenly sound a bit angry ?
Well , sometimes I am ; nobody likes to be passed over for promotions or denied exciting publishing opportunities because they do n't make a good first impression or because they have n't made the right kinds of friends .
But most of the time , I am very happy to be what I am and to have had the life I have had , reminding myself that the traits making me the World 's Worst Interview are also the reasons why I have become a recognized science fiction scholar and commentator .
Blessed with a personality that is conducive to success in this evolving world , I have understandably achieved at least a modicum of success in this world , and while I can sometimes be resistant to change , I also feel extraordinarily well prepared to handle whatever cold comforts the future may bring .
Can the mundane people of this world say the same ?

Peace Now : Largest settlement is built on private Palestinian land
Peace Now says nearly 40 % of the land the settlements sit on is , according to official data , " effectively stolen " from Palestinian landowners .
This , the group says , is a violation of Israel 's own laws .
Settlements in the occupied West Bank are illegal under international law , although Israel rejects this .
About 430,000 Jews live in these residential areas in the West Bank and East Jerusalem .
Leaked data
Peace Now called on the Israeli government to return the private land to its Palestinian owners .
In recent years the Israeli government has said repeatedly that it respects Palestinian property rights in the West Bank .
An Israeli official has said the government is reviewing the report .
REPORT FINDINGS
130 settlements were constructed either entirely or partially on private Palestinian land 19,800 acres of the land used by the settlements , nearly 40 % of the total , is private Palestinian land 86.4 % of Maale Adumim is built on privately - owned land Source : Peace Now Breaking the law in the West Bank [ 379 KB ]

The data on which the findings are based comes from a 2004 survey by the Civil Administration , which manages the civilian aspects of Israel 's occupation of the West Bank .
The data was leaked to Peace Now via an official in the Civil Administration .
The group says the government had refused to give this information to it .
The group says that the data it has received has been " hidden by the State for many years , for fear that the revelation of these facts could damage its international relations " .
According to the report , 86.4 % of the Maale Adumim settlement block , the largest in the West Bank , is built on private Palestinian land , and not on what the Israeli government refers to as " state land " .
The settlement is home to 32,372 people and lies due east of Jerusalem .
' Violation ' of Israeli law
" The claim by the State and settlers that the settlements have been constructed on state land is misleading and false , " Peace Now says .
JEWISH SETTLEMENTS
Illegal under international law according to Fourth Geneva Convention ( article 49 ) , which prohibits an occupying power transferring citizens from its own territory to occupied territory Israel argues international conventions relating to occupied land do not apply to West Bank because it was not under the legitimate sovereignty of any state before 1967
The Geneva Convention
" The vast majority of settlement construction was done against the law of the land and the Supreme Court ruling and therefore unauthorised .
" [ The data ] indicates the direct violation of Israeli law carried out by the State itself , driven by the architects and leaders of the settlement movement . "
In 1979 the Israeli High Court forbade the establishment of settlements on privately - owned Palestinian that has been seized by Israel for military purposes .
The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is at its core a conflict over land and in the West Bank property rights , BBC Jerusalem correspondent Crispin Thorold says .
This is the area which Palestinians want to be the basis of a future independent state .
If confirmed the findings could have major implications for any future peace deal .
Some of the settlements that the Israeli government wants to be included within its final borders are built on land overwhelmingly owned by Palestinian individuals .
Peace Now is an Israeli group that monitors Israel settlements in the West Bank .
The oldest peace movement in Israel , it advocates the setting up of a Palestinian state on land occupied by Israel in 1967 .

What could be more entertaining than an entire federal commission utilizing tons of public resources over long periods of time to mull over the merits of the term " wang " and argue over whether Janet 's pastie - covered nipple was exposed for 19 /32 or 9/16 of a second ( I told you to read those footnotes ) ?
Double - standards ahoy
Fuck and shit are ok in a broadcast of Saving Private Ryan , but not a blues documentary ?
Brief , fleeting frontal nudity is ok in a broadcast of Schindler 's List , but not during the Super Bowl halftime show or a talk show ?
Pixelation just is n't enough to protect the public from naked boobs ?
Non-nude scenes that merely imply sex are n't kosher any longer ?
And let 's not even begin to pierce the surface of the glaring racial and gender politics weaved into these decisions ...
Turkey braces for pope visit : Security teams take up positions , small protests break out ISTANBUL , Turkey ( AP ) 
Turkish security teams took up positions around the cities of Ankara and Istanbul on Monday , a day before Pope Benedict XVI begins his first visit to a predominantly Muslim country .
RELATED : Pope 's dual tests in Turkey : simmering Muslim anger and EU wrangles | Video Small protests broke out in both cities , but authorities say security measures for the pope — who angered Muslims worldwide with comments in September on Islam and violence — will be tighter than they were for the visit of President Bush .
Benedict is to arrive at the Ankara airport on Tuesday at around noon , where he will meet briefly with Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan , who waited until the day before Benedict 's arrival to announce that he would make time to meet the pope .
News reports say some 3,000 police officers have been assigned to guard the pope upon his arrival in the dusty , sprawling capital Ankara .
Snipers will watch from hillsides and tall buildings , and armored vehicles and riot police will be stationed near the areas he is scheduled to visit .
Police also were mobilizing and staking out spots in Istanbul , where Benedict will spend most of his four days in Turkey .
" We have taken all the necessary measures and observations of the route the pope ( will travel ) and the places the pope will visit , " Istanbul police spokesman Ismail Caliskan said .
On Monday , a group of around 100 pro-Islamic demonstrators displayed what they said were a million signatures for a petition demanding that the Haghia Sophia , now a museum in Istanbul , be declared a mosque and opened to worship for Muslims .
The Haghia Sophia was built in the 6th century as a Christian church , but was converted to a mosque in 1453 when Islamic armies conquered the city — then a Christian metropolis called Constantinople .
In a speech on Sunday , Benedict said he was coming to Turkey as a friend of the Turks and asked his followers to pray for him .
That same day , more than 25,000 Turks showed up to a mass anti-Vatican protest in Istanbul , asking the pope to stay at home .
The visit to Turkey will be a test of whether this pope can soften some of the Christian - Muslim tensions that boiled over after Benedict quoted a Byzantine emperor who characterized some of the teachings of Islam 's prophet Muhammad as " evil and inhuman . "
The visit will also be a test of the Turkish public 's willingness to tolerate criticism of Islam and their ability to coordinate a massive and potentially problematic visit .
After spending Tuesday night in Ankara , Benedict will visit Ephesus and Istanbul , where he will meet with Bartholomew I , the Istanbul - based leader of the world 's 300 million Orthodox Christians .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
A federal jury said Thursday that software maker Microsoft Corp. infringed audio patents held by Alcatel - Lucent and should pay $ 1.52 billion in damages .
Tom Burt , Microsoft corporate vice president and deputy general counsel , said the verdict was unsupported by law or facts .
" Today 's outcome is disappointing for us and for the hundreds of other companies who have licensed MP3 technology .
" We will seek relief from the trial court , and if necessary appeal , " Burt said .
" ( This case ) will go on for a long time , " said Sid Parakh , an analyst with McAdams Wright Ragen .
" I do n't see any near term impact on Microsoft . "
" It 's not like Microsoft has to pay out the cash tomorrow , " he added .
Alcatel - Lucent had accused Microsoft of infringing on patents related to standards used for playing computer music files .
" We made strong arguments supporting our view and we are pleased with the court 's decision , " an Alcatel - Lucent spokeswoman said .
The decision is latest move in a series of patent infringement lawsuits between Microsoft and Lucent , which Alcatel acquired in November .
Shares of Microsoft ( up $ 0.03 to $ 29.39 , Charts ) edged lower in late trade Thursday , while Alcatel - Lucent ( up $ 0.07 to $ 13.14 , Charts ) gained nearly 1 percent .

President Bush ’s new budget proposal cuts more than $ 53 million money from the budget of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting ( CPB ) , the agency that allocates federal money for NPR , PBS and other federally funded media .
This is a quarter of the CPB budget .
This same budget will drastically crank up military spending to support a war effort that is now heading toward $ 500 BILLION , an amount that is 10,000 times more than the proposed CPB cut .
Iraq spending is now $ 300 Million per DAY .
That daily expense is six times more than the ANNUAL amount of the proposed CPB budget cut .
Can you help out by signing this petition to Congress ?
It ’s really easy — just click this link .
Here ’s the basic message of the Petition ( but you can modify this message as you please ) :
“ Congress must save NPR and PBS once and for all .
Congress should guarantee permanent funding and independence from partisan meddling . ”
We ’ve stopped similar cuts in the past , but enough is enough : With the new Congress , we can make sure this never happens again .
For more on the amount Bush wants to cut from NPR and PBS , see here and here .
Here ’s more background :
Congress can protect NPR and PBS from future cuts .
The long - term solution to save public radio and TV is to :
fully restore this year ’s funding
guarantee a permanent funding stream free from political pressure
reform how the money is spent and keep partisan appointees from pushing a political bias
Bush ’s budget would cut federal funds for public broadcasting by nearly 25 % .
According to PBS , the cuts “ could mean the end of our ability to support some of the most treasured educational children ’s series ” like “ Sesame Street , ” “ Reading Rainbow , ” and “ Arthur . ”
The cuts could also decimate one of the last remaining sources of watchdog reporting on TV — continuing the partisan war on journalism led by the ex-chair of public broadcasting , Ken Tomlinson .
More people trust public broadcasting than any corporate news media .
President Bush would rather undermine our free press than face reporters who are asking tough questions .

Thank you for considering this .
Imagine we are foreign intelligence service agents and we are spying on Russian military bases .
Just a few years ago it was impossible , and it was even more impossible ( if that ’s a thing ) during the iron curtain era .
But now thanks to google we can see all the top secret Russian objects clearly in these shots .
Russia still stays very militarized country .
If we were to explore just a small part of it with Google Earth , in the Murmansk region ( one of many of Russian regions ) which is located next to Norway and Finland , we can see dozens of military objects , mainly Russian Navy ones .
Here they are :
All the locations of these shots have been reported to be the Murmansk region .
This one is Olenegorsk , a Russian air force base .
Those are not just fighters , those are strategic bombers .
Murmansk itself , abandoned navy ships .
Murmansk .
A nuclear - powered ice - breaker in the dock .
Kola Bay , near Murmansk , the small town of “ Poliarniy ” , and the oil - tanker “ Belokamenka ” .
One of the largest oil tankers in the world .
It is 100 feet tall ( as tall as a ten storey building ) .
It is more than 1000 ft long ( 340 metres ) , with a width of 200 ft ( 65 metres ) , and it transports 4 millions tons of oil each year .
Severomorsk .
Ships of the Russian Northern Navy .
The sixth from the left is the biggest ship in the Russian Northern Navy – the nuclear - powered cruiser “ Kirov ” .

Russian submarines .
Different types of Russian submarines .
Russian S-300 ( SA - 10 ) long range surface - to - air missiles .
The same ones as Russia now exports to Iran .
We had an article a few months ago about an inflatable version of those missiles – the ones that can fool overhead observers .
Another abandoned ship near Murmansk .
More Russian submarines .
It is the home base of the legendary “ Kursk ” submarine , the one which sank a few years ago near Murmansk and the whole crew died because the rescue team did not come in time .
Take a note on the submarine to the right – it is split into two parts , probably this is a bug in google photos .
And even more abandoned Russian Navy ships .
Some unidentified Navy object a few miles from the shore .
All the submarines we have seen before were children ’s toys in comparison with these .
Those are sisters of the already mentioned “ Kursk ” submarine .
500 ft long , 60 ft high .
They say they can raze major USA cities to the ground .
Those are the previously top - secret “ Taifun ” class submarines .
The biggest nuclear - powered submarines in the world .
They could carry up to 200 missiles .
Here are them from a more distant perspective .
“ Taifuns ” on the left and “ 949A ” ( “ Kursk sisters ” ) on the left .

The Digital Media Project at the Berkman Center for Internet & Society at Harvard Law School has issued a paper looking at how copyright , contract and technology are converging and diverging in the digital media realm .
Their study chose the iTunes Music Store model as a case for the study in order to look at how the business model of the service relates to legal contexts throughout the world as well as to specific hot spots of contention in current legal discourse .
The full 100 - page study can be found here ( PDF ) , and a summary of the study can be found here ( PDF ) .
The paper looks at a number of interesting issues , including the convergence of copyright and contract , the legal cushioning that props up Digital Rights Management Technologies ( e.g. , the DMCA ) , and fair use .
Anyone strongly interested in this topic is well advised to just get a nice cup of coffee and read through this .
Maybe you 'll need two cups ; it 's a bit long , but it 's rather revealing .
What follows is a necessarily loose , free - wheelin ' read of the paper .
The paper begins by outlining how contracts are being used to restrict the normal freedom given to users by copyright law in general .
Contract trumps copyright , at least in the United States and Europe , which means the courts will typically arbitrate disputes based on contract and not intellectual property law per se .
This is already an interesting development because of what we tend to call the shrink - wrap phenomenon : digital content is being sold in a manner more akin to software than tangible content , although even there , software buyers typically have more rights .
El Trumpage continues : one of the biggest legal questions to arise out of the DMCA and DRM - efforts relates to how these technologies conspire to essentially shut down or make exceedingly difficult the right of second sale of protected content .
This is , of course , what we saw with the attempt to sell an iTunes song on eBay back in September of '03 .
First Sale Doctrine , the exclusive right to distribute content , would normally dictate that a purchaser of copyrighted material has the right to resell such material , provided that they have not copied it .
So , our software buying pal whose rights are governed by a EULA can typically resell the software .
The paper notes , however , that First Sale Doctrine is not being applied to digital content because the proposed business models supposedly need even more exclusive rights to distribution , and DRM technologies by design are not friendly to portability ( as compared to , say , tangible goods such as CDs and DVDs ) .
The most interesting part of the paper was its treatment of fair use , if only because it looks like fair use is where the real battle needs to take place .
( And did n't we already know that ? )
Fair use has the potential to affect the business model of an online music service in at least two ways : ( 1 ) creating expectations on the part of the customer and ( 2 ) increasing or decreasing the willingness of copyright holders to supply music , or in other words , increasing or decreasing the amount of effort and care a music provider must put into designing its DRM system to protect copyright holders or even causing a music provider to decide no DRM system would be sufficient .
Fair use is copyright law 's attempt to codify reasonable exceptions and limitations to the exclusive rights normally granted to copyright holders .
If a use is considered " fair " by the law , customers might expect it and are likely to make a decision whether or not to use a particular system based on to what extent that system allows the use .
As the market for online music distribution grows , competition between distributors could result in an ever increasing set of allowed uses .
Fair use can also be seen as a work - around of the copyright .
As such , copyright holders — depending on the context — might see fair uses as dangers to their rights .
As a general rule , the more fair uses allowed , the more danger a copyright holder may perceive .
The paper rightly notes that the US and Europe , acting in order to fulfill the demands of the WIPO , are drafting and enforcing laws designed to trump fair use by making it illegal to circumvent DRM .
The chain works loosely as follows : copyright is trumped by contractual law , which seeks to restrict fair use in legal terms , which then backs up that by requiring adherence to the rules that are technologically enforced by DRM , which itself is protected by laws such as the DMCA in the US and the EU Copyright Directive in Europe ( again , both are implementations of WIPO treaties ) .
Some might call it a house of cards built upon the fear of fair use .
Since this post is already novel - length , I 'd like to take a moment and offer additional points to consider in this matter .
Fair Use has always been a thorn in the side of content producers .
Long before there was digital content flowing through he veins of the 'net , there were battles over what was and was not permissible with content .
The advent of tape recorders caused a shockwave .
VHS and Betamax exacerbated the arguments , but the courts for the most part defended the rights of consumers .
Now it 's 2004 , and most of the media is ignoring the real drive behind DRM .
It 's not piracy .
It 's our old pal , Fair Use .
For the first time in history , we can copy content and distribute it over massive global networks .
We can put copies on every device we own , and we can even modify the content to suit our own needs .
But more important , and do n't miss this now , for the first time in history , the content producers and distributors have a technological way of shutting off Fair Use through contract language , DRM technology , and anti-circumvention laws .
I 've said it before and I 'll say it again : DRM is not about piracy , it 's about shutting down fair use .
It makes a lot of sense when you start thinking about DRM being Sonny Bono 's twin brother .
It 's one of the key pieces of that horrid affront to the progress of civilization : the perpetual copyright .
Bush vows to 60 Minutes that ' no matter what Congress wants ' surge is on
RAW STORY
Published : Saturday January 13 , 2007 Print This Email This
In an interview set to air on this Sunday 's 60 Minutes , President George W. Bush vows to send an additional 21,500 troops to Iraq " no matter what " the Democratic - controlled Congress tries to do .
" Do you believe as Commander in Chief you have the authority to put the troops in there no matter what the Congress wants to do , " 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley asks Bush in the short clip uploaded to the CBS News web site Friday night .
" I think I 've got , in this situation , I do , yeah , " Bush said .
" Now I fully understand they will , " Bush continued , " they could try to stop me from doing it , but , uh , I 've made my decision and we 're going forward . "
In an address to the nation on Wednesday , Bush announced his new plan which calls for an increase in US troops to end ongoing violence in the country , which many believe is either at or approaching " civil war , " with Iraqi civilian deaths tripling at the end of 2006 , according to one report .
The plan , nicknamed " surge " by the administration but referred to as an " escalation " by most Democrats has drawn fire from both parties , and Congressional members have threatened to cut funding  though not for the troops that are already there .
" Rep. John Murtha , a Pennsylvania Democrat who oversees military funding , said he will propose tying congressional approval of war funds to shutting the Guantanamo Bay military prison in Cuba , " the Associated Press reports .
" Other conditions he said he is considering include not extending troop deployments and giving soldiers and Marines more time to train between deployments . "

Smart Sharpen
A new feature of Photoshop CS2 is the Smart Sharpen tool .
This tool provides photographers with even more control over their photographs .
Unfortunately , this tool is not available in previous versions of Adobe Photoshop , therefore , only users who have upgraded to Photoshop CS2 will be able to benefit from this tutorial .
This is the first change in the Filter > Sharpen menu in 14 years !
( Learn about Sharpening Basics by clicking here for part 1 of this series )
NOTE : You can click on all the images to increase their size ! 😀
The Smart Sharpen tool can be found by going to the Filter Menu Item and then going in to the Sharpen Menu .
Filter > Sharpen > Smart Sharpen .
You will now see a window called “ Smart Sharpen ” .
This window has an option to choose from Basic and Advanced modes .
Below that you will see a Settings drop down menu .
This settings drop down menu allows you to save the current settings so you can easily get to them later .
Below that you will see Amount and Radius .
So far everything is very similar to the Unsharp Mask tool .
The difference will now be apparent because of the Remove options .
The Remove Drop down menu has three options .
These allow you to remove Gaussian Blur , Lens Blur and Motion Blur .
Each option triggers a different algorithm that Photoshop uses to remove these specific types of blurs .
Finally , if you choose the Advanced Radio button you will be able to see three tabs : Sharpen , Highlights and Shadows .
These allow the user to set the sharpness of the midtones , highlights and shadows .
This is useful because sometimes you do n’t want the shadows to be as sharp as the highlights ( or vice versa ) .
Let ’s go over each option available to us :
The Remove Options
These options allow us to remove blurs caused by the three common types of blurs : Gaussian , Lens and Motion blurs .
Removing Gaussian Blur
The Gaussian Blur is very similar to viewing an image from an out - of - focus lens .
If your image has a consistent soft blur with no areas of sharpness then this is the option to use .
If the image you are working on is slightly out of focus then applying the Gaussian Blur Removal option will fix that problem .
This is very similar to our regular unsharp masking technique .
Nothing new here .
( gaussian blur )
( after smart sharpen : remove gaussian blur ) ( gaussian blur ) ( after smart sharpen : remove gaussian blur )
Removing Lens Blur
A lens blur is similar to Gaussian blur but a little different because it is not as soft .
The Lens Blur Removal option removes the lens blur while finding edges and not creating obvious halos .
This is also useful for images with finer details .
( lens blur )
( after smart sharpen : remove lens blur ) ( lens blur ) ( after smart sharpen : remove lens blur )
Removing Motion Blur
A motion blur happen when the camera or the subject moves or the camera shutter is open for too long .
A faint trail of the subject is formed and there is little sharpness to the image .
After choosing the Motion Blur removal option you will see that you are given the option to choose the angle .
Just choose the angle that is as close as possible to the direction of the motion blur .
The more accurate you are with the angle the better the motion blur will be fixed .
The Motion Blur Removal option works best if the motion blur happens only in one direction .
Sometimes the camera may move in many directions and if that happens then the result of this tool is not very great but you can try applying two remove - motion - blur smart sharpens one after the other for each angle in which the motion blur exists .
( motion blur )
( after smart sharpen : remove motion blur ) ( motion blur ) ( after smart sharpen : remove motion blur )
Advanced Mode
There are times when you might want only some parts of an image sharpened while leaving the rest untouched .
There may be times when you want to sharpen parts of an image more than other parts .
Put your selection tools back because you probably wo n’t need them because the smart sharpen tool will take care of everything .
Clicking on the Advanced radio button will bring up three tabs called Sharpen , Shadow and Highlight .
The Shadow and Highlight tabs have three sliders called Fade Amount , Tonal Width and Radius .
The main advantage of the Advanced mode of the Sharpen tool is that it allows us to set the sharpness of Midtones , Shadows and Highlights individually .
Mainly we ’ll be controlling what gets sharpened LESS .
The Fade Amount controls the strength of the sharpening in either areas that are considered shadows or highlights ( depending on which tab you are currently in ) .
If you increase the fade amount of shadows then the dark areas of your image will not be as sharp .
If you increase the fade amount of highlights then the light areas will not be as sharp .
The higher this setting , the more the sharpness decreases .
The lower this setting , the more the sharpness increases .
Here is a demonstration of Fade Amount :
1 . Let ’s take a look at this Arch thingamajig :
2 . I ’m going to zoom in to one of the shadows and INCREASE the fade amount to 100 %
3 . Next , I ’m going to DECREASE the fade amount to 0 %
4 . Did you notice the sharpness of the shadows ?
When the fade amount of the shadows is 100 % then the shadows do n’t get sharpened .
When you decrease the fade amount to 0 % then all the shadows get the full sharpness treatment !
Pretty neat !
The Tonal Width controls which tonal values will be affected by the reduction in sharpness .
The tonal width is defined as the difference between the lightest part of the image and the darkest part of the image .
The Tonal Width slider determines which tonal values will be sharpened ( or not sharpened ) .
If the value of the Tonal Width slider is small then only lightest highlights or darkest shadows ( depending on whether you are in the highlights or shadows tab ) will be affected by the sharpening reduction .
If the value of the Tonal width slider is great then a greater range or highlights or shadows will be affected by the sharpening reduction .
Here is an example :
1 . We ’ll take the same image again .
First I ’m going to set the fade amount to 100 % ( Recall that increasing the fade amount decreases the sharpness ) .
Then I ’m going to change the tonal width to 0 % .
You ’ll notice that everything is sharpened despite the fact that the fade amount is 100 % .
The reason for that is that the Tonal width controls where the sharpness DECREASES .
So when you change the tonal width to 0 % then the sharpness does not decrease anywhere .
2 . Now I will increase the Tonal width to 100 % and the sharpeness gets reduced all over the image .
The Radius slider determines which areas are to be considered shadows or highlights .
This basically controls the size of the area around each pixel that is used to determine whether a pixel is a shadow or a highlight .
A small radius means that small patches of darks and lights will be considered shadows or highlights .
A large radius means that large patches of darks and lights will be considered to be shadows or highlights .
Let ’s Smart Sharpen an image ( Click the images to enlarge ) :
1 . I ’m going to choose the first image I get from http://www.sxc.hu
2. Open up the Smart Sharpen Tool ( Filter > Sharpen > Smart Sharpen ) .
Choose the advanced radio button and make sure all the settings in Shadows and Highlights tab are set to zero .
3 . Go back to the sharpen tab and adjust the settings mainly to get a good sharp edge .
I used the following settings :
4 . Now go to the shadows tab .
Now we will increase these settings so we can remove as much noise from the shadows as possible .
I zoomed into an area with lots of shadow .
I used the following settings and it seemed to rid the noise quite well with out loosing sharpness .
5 . Finally I went to the highlights tab and removed as much noise as I could from highlights .
I also made sure that the image did retain some softness ( your preference ) .
6 . The final image and the initial image has subtle differences and most of the time these subtle differences are what really matter .
Here is another example of sharpness correction :

( after )
I hope you found this tutorial helpful .
There are even more sharpness techniques that I will cover in the near future .
At this time I feel like creating my next tutorial about something other than sharpness 😀
Thanks for readings .

FRESH Kills landfill in New York , until recently the biggest rubbish tip on earth , was said to be one of the very few man-made objects visible from space , along with the Great Wall of China .
Of the two , the blob - shaped dump would probably have been easier to spot than the ribbon of the wall , until New York 's city government decided to redevelop Fresh Kills as a park a few years ago .
In its way , Fresh Kills was an emblem of American culture , just as the Great Wall is an emblem of Chinese culture .
This is not to say that American culture is trash , but that trash is culture .
Different countries ' attitudes to rubbish turn out to be just as distinctive as their historical monuments .
Countries differ , obviously , in the amount of trash they generate .
The very poorest ones produce almost none at all .
Material that would qualify as trash in richer places is fed to livestock , or spread as compost , or burnt for fuel , or recycled in some other way .
A problem of waste disposal arises only when people get rich enough to buy manufactured goods that they cannot or will not recycle personally .
Plastic bags carpet much of the developing world because locals do not know how to turn them into anything else .
Wealth is a good predictor of how much a country throws away , but it is not the best .
Veolia Environmental Services , a firm that collects or disposes of rubbish in 33 countries , commissioned a global study of garbage called the " World Waste Survey " .
It found that a country 's consumption of paper is a strong indicator of how full its dustbins will be .
In several European countries where paper consumption is growing more slowly than the economy as a whole , the correlation between disposable income and disposal of waste is beginning to break down .
Different countries dispose of their rubbish in different ways .
Americans and Australians , with lots of land at their disposal , like to dump it .
More crowded places , such as Singapore and Taiwan , and ones with great reverence for their landscape , such as Switzerland , tend to burn it .
Germans , says Denis Gasquet of Veolia , have a soft spot for industrial schemes that recycle waste or generate energy from it .
Even within globalised pressure groups , such as Greenpeace , he observes , activists in one country cannot agree with their counterparts in another about how waste should be processed .
God proposes , man disposes
Veolia 's report unearths some oddities .
Residents of cities in China proper throw out roughly one - quarter more than the citizens of Hong Kong do , and three - quarters more than the average Taiwanese .
Japan seems to produce only a fraction of the quantities of hazardous waste that Europe and America churn out ―perhaps because Japanese officials class fewer things as hazardous , speculates Philippe Chalmin , the author of the report .
On the whole , this variety is good .
It is likely to nurture a wide range of technologies for waste disposal , and so provide more options for everyone .
It reflects the fact that countries with different geographies and histories will have different environmental priorities .
But if garbage disposal is as much a matter of cultural norms as of technology or regulation or economics , might the same be said of other fraught environmental issues ?
Green activists tend to speak about their favoured policies as if these were dictated by science alone .
Budgets might come into the calculation , but the implication is still that reasonable people would all do the same thing , given enough time and money .
In the case of trash , at least , that is a load of rubbish .

[ On October 27 , as East Coast residents prepared for Hurricane Sandy , New Jersey Governor Chris Christie threatened " price gougers " with stiff penalties .
As David Brown pointed out in Mises Daily on August 17 , 2004 , shortly after Hurricane Charley hit Florida , foul weather is when we need market prices the most .
Capitalism needs more foul - weather friends , not fair - weather friends like Christie . ]
In the evening before Hurricane Charley hit central Florida , news anchors Bob Opsahl and Martie Salt of Orlando 's Channel 9 complained that we " sure do n't need " vendors to take advantage of the coming storm by raising their prices for urgently needed emergency supplies .
In the days since the hurricane hit , many other reporters and public officials have voiced similar sentiments .
There are laws against raising prices during a natural disaster .
It 's called " price gouging . "
The state 's attorney general has assured Floridians that he 's going to crack down on such .
There 's even a hotline you can call if you notice a store charging a higher price for an urgently needed good than you paid before demand for the good suddenly went through the roof .
The penalties are stiff : up to $ 25,000 per day for multiple violations .
But offering goods for sale is per se " taking advantage " of customers .
Customers also " take advantage " of sellers .
Both sides gain from the trade .
In an unhampered market , the self - interest of vendors who supply urgently needed goods meshes beautifully with the self - interest of customers who urgently need these goods .
In a market , we have price mechanisms to ensure that when there is any dramatic change in the supply of a good or the demand for a good , economic actors can respond accordingly , taking into account the new information and incentives .
If that 's rapacity , bring on the rapacity .
Prices are how scarce goods get allocated in markets in accordance with actual conditions .
When demand increases , prices go up , all other things being equal .
It 's not immoral .
If orange groves are frozen over ( or devastated by Hurricane Charley ) , leading to fewer oranges going to market , the price of oranges on the market is going to go up as a result of the lower supply .
And if demand for a good suddenly lapses or supply of that good suddenly expands , prices will go down .
Should lower prices be illegal too ?
In the same newscast , Salt and Opsahl reported that a local gas station had run out of gas and that the owner was hoping to receive more gas by midnight .
Other central Florida stations have also run out of gas , especially in the days since the hurricane smacked our area .
Power outages persist for many homes and businesses , and roads are blocked by trees , power lines , and chunks of roofs , so it is hard to obtain new supplies .
Yet it 's illegal for sellers of foodstuffs , water , ice , and gas to respond to the shortages and difficulty of restocking by raising their prices .
If we expect customers to be able to get what they need in an emergency , when demand zooms vendors must be allowed and encouraged to increase their prices .
Supplies are then more likely to be sustained , and the people who most urgently need a particular good will more likely be able to get it .
That is especially important during an emergency .
Price gouging saves lives .
What would happen if prices were allowed to go up in defiance of the government ?
Well , let 's consider ice .
Before Charley hit , few in central Florida had stocked up on ice .
It had looked like the storm was going to skirt our part of the state ; on the day of landfall , however , it veered eastward , thwarting all the meteorological predictions .
After Charley cut his swath through central Florida , hundreds of thousands of central Florida residents were unexpectedly deprived of electrical power and therefore of refrigeration .
Hence the huge increase in demand for ice .
Let us postulate that a small Orlando drug store has ten bags of ice in stock that , prior to the storm , it had been selling for $ 4.39 a bag .
Of this stock it could normally expect to sell one or two bags a day .
In the wake of Hurricane Charley , however , ten local residents show up at the store over the course of a day to buy ice .
Most want to buy more than one bag .
So what happens ?
If the price is kept at $ 4.39 a bag because the drugstore owner fears the wrath of State Attorney General Charlie Crist and the finger wagging of local news anchors , the first five people who want to buy ice might obtain the entire stock .
The first person buys one bag , the second person buys four bags , the third buys two bags , the fourth buys two bags , and the fifth buys one bag .
The last five people get no ice .
Yet one or more of the last five applicants may need the ice more desperately than any of the first five .
But suppose the store owner is operating in an unhampered market .
Realizing that many more people than usual will now demand ice , and also realizing that with supply lines temporarily severed it will be difficult or impossible to bring in new supplies of ice for at least several days , he resorts to the expedient of raising the price to , say , $ 15.39 a bag .
Now customers will act more economically with respect to the available supply .
Now , the person who has $ 60 in his wallet , and who had been willing to pay $ 17 to buy four bags of ice , may be willing to pay for only one or two bags of ice ( because he needs the balance of his ready cash for other immediate needs ) .
Some of the persons seeking ice may decide that they have a large enough reserve of canned food in their homes that they do n't need to worry about preserving the one pound of ground beef in their freezer .
They may forgo the purchase of ice altogether , even if they can " afford " it in the sense that they have $ 20 bills in their wallets .
Meanwhile , the stragglers who in the first scenario lacked any opportunity to purchase ice will now be able to .
Note that even if the drug store owner guesses wrong about what the price of his ice should be , under this scenario vendors throughout central Florida would all be competing to find the right price to meet demand and maximize their profits .
Thus , if the tenth person who shows up at the drugstore desperately needs ice and barely misses his chance to buy ice at the drugstore in our example , he still has a much better chance to obtain ice down the street at some other place that has a small reserve of ice .
Indeed , under this second scenario — the market scenario— vendors are scrambling to make ice available and to advertise that availability by whatever means available to them given the lack of power .
Vendors who would have stayed home until power was generally restored might now go to heroic lengths to keep their stores open and make their surviving stocks available to consumers .
The " problem " of " price gouging " will not be cured by imposing rationing along with price controls , either .
Rationing of price - controlled ice would still maintain an artificially low price for ice , so the day after the storm hits there would still be no economic incentive for ice vendors to scramble to keep ice available given limited supplies that cannot be immediately replenished .
And while it is true that rationing might prevent the person casually purchasing four bags of ice from obtaining all four of those bags ( at least from one store with a particularly diligent clerk ) , the rationing would also prevent the person who desperately needs four bags of ice from getting it .
Nobody knows the local circumstances and needs of buyers and sellers better than individual buyers and sellers themselves .
When allowed to respond to real demand and real supply , prices and profits communicate the information and incentives that people require to meet their needs economically given all the relevant circumstances .
There is no substitute for the market .
And we should not be surprised that command - and - control intervention in the market cannot duplicate what economic actors accomplish on their own if allowed to act in accordance with their own self - interest and knowledge of their own case .
But we know all this already .
We know that people lined up for gas in very long lines during the 1970s because the whole country was being treated as if it had been hit by a hurricane that was never going to go away .
We also know that as soon as the price controls on gas were lifted , the long lines disappeared , as if a switch had been thrown restoring power to the whole economy .
One item in very short supply among the finger - wagging newscasters and public officials here in central Florida is an understanding of elementary economics .
Maybe FEMA can fly in a few crates of Henry Hazlitt 's Economics in One Lesson and drop them on Bob and Martie and all the other newscasters and public officials .
This could be followed up with a boatload of George Reisman 's Capitalism : A Treatise on Economics , which offers a wonderfully cogent and extensive explanation of prices and the effects of interference with prices .
Some vintage Mises and Hayek would also be nice .
But at least the Hazlitt .
" Price gouging " is nothing more than charging what the market will bear .
If that 's immoral , then all market adjustment to changing circumstances is " immoral , " and markets per se are immoral .
But that is not the case .
And I do n't think a store owner who makes money by satisfying the urgent needs of his customers is immoral either .
It is called making a living .
And , in the wake of Hurricane Charley , surviving .
