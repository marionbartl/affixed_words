Even tho I think NH should recount and count the first time free , once Kucinich led everyone to believe he was going to have it done , he should have kept his word .
What is he , a pol ?
Having said all that , still with the mickey mouse dog and pony show of a " chain of custody " , the recount or count would be useless anyway .
I mean in terms of the way adults do chain of custody of ballots .
NH is a joke at election integrity .
And thus yet another chapter ends as a flop in the election integrity realm of Amurka .

It seems to me , given the inaccuracies that have already been found --- inaccuracies that already make this election technically illegal --- Kucinich should not have to pay for the rest of the recount anyway .
New Hampshire should be paying for it .
Unbelievable that they would just stop this recount now when they 've uncovered some serious errors .
Or maybe , on second thought , that 's why they 're stopping it .

For Hillsborough County , 80,946 votes were originally counted , 80,968 were counted during the recount , and 950 gross votes were misread .
That 's an error rate of 1.17 % .

At this point I have little information , but I saw an article this morning regarding the vote counting machines here in Sacramento .
The tabulators at the polling stations did n't pass the acceptance test - instead the ballots will be shipped to a central location and counted on different tabulators there .

I have it on impeccable authority that " the funds ran out " is pure , unadulterated bull shit .
It was not an issue of money running out .
Rather it appears to be that the candidate is " cutting and running " , I term I hoped i'd never have to apply to Dennis Kucinich .
His team did very little to raise issues about the lack of any real chain of custody , the key element that would legitimize any recount .
This is EXACTLY what " they " wanted .
They wanted us ( the EI folks and in this case , Kucinich ) to get tired and quit before all the evidence was examined .
Drag it out so it will be months or so before the recount is done .
Funny how they take so long to recount , and so little time to do the count originally .
Yes , I know they used scanners for 81 % of the votes originally , but still , less than two counties counted in the week since this started - this is ridiculous .
Democracy is spinning down the drain .

I do n't recall it being said that he only paid " some " , and not all that the SoS demanded up front ..?
Even so , now that we see how hosed the counts are ( and by far for Shillary ) , perhaps it 's time for Edwards or Obama to demand a count , since it 's free ( or $ 200 ? or what was that ? ) .
Stopping at this stage is crazy because we 're seeing a HUGE problem there , but it will be easily dismissable by the MSM if it stops at these 2 counties ..
If we can show a problem across the entire state , they - might - care * does n't hold breath *
And I 'd like to keep this thing under the spot light to let America see just how we treat our " vote " these days .. broken cardboard boxes ?
1/2 - assed taped lids ?
missing hardware ( lost / missing / dumped cards ) ?.. $ 3 billion in revenue and they can't get metal / fiberglass / plastic boxes that have a little bit of staying power ? .. wow .

My 13 year old could do a better job of counting than this ... and he has a little " lock box " that I consider more secure than these " vaults " .
Regardless of party affiliation , your vote should be viable .
V oter
I integrity
A nd
B allot
L egitimacy
E nabled No more electronic devices , period .
Chain of custody strictly enforced , by armed personnel .
( As a former courier for an armored car company , I can tell you that people do n't go sticking their noses where they should n't be when firearms and the right to use them are present - even the police would n't come near . )
Anybody not authorized to be in the vault should get the Elmer Fudd treatment .
Easy to read and understandable paper ballots .
Is that too much to ask for ?
Is it too complex , or maybe the armed guards part is too scary ?

Re : Bluebear2 # 4
You are correct .
Sacramento County is scrapping ALL of it's ES&S optical scanners ( M100 ) for the Feb 5th election in its 548 polling places .
The ballots will be boxed up and driven to a central office to be counted by an optical scanner ( ES&S 650 ) .
This is the same scanner that is used to count the absentee ballots .
I just spoke to Brad Buyse at the voter registrars office to verify this .
I posted the Sac Bee article on our site .
This quote scares me the most :
" We 've never had any problem with them when we used them before – that is why it 's kind of baffling , " Buyse said . "
What has changed with either the machines , their secret proprietary software , or the testing process since the last time they were tested ?
I am glad that the Logic and Accuracy tests caught these problems BEFORE our election .
I have no problem waiting hours or days to make sure that every vote is counted as cast .
I do have concerns regarding the central tabulation of all of our county 's votes though .
I hope a strict chain of custody is adhered to and I will follow up on this issue .
A lot can happen to uncounted ballots from the time they leave the polling place until they get to the central tabulation location .

What 's really interesting is the distribution of the discrepancies between count and recount by precinct size ( see http://drvolin-theconspiracist.blogspot.com for graph ) .
The largest errors are in the mid-range of precinct size .
In terms of stats , that 's completely unexpected .
You would expect to have smaller counting errors in smaller precincts , and progressively larger errors in larger precincts .

... James said on 1/23/2008 @ 6:51 pm PT ...
Sorry to say that the statistic on errors reported in Comment 3 may be a minimum .
Because of the method of counting being manual and machine , there is a mixing of misreads so that the 950 will be a Best Case .
I took the Hillsborough data as of 9:15 EST ( 6:15 PT ) and calculated exactly 1057 total of " differences within a precinct " .
Thats over a total of 80,969 ballots .
That works out to 1.305 % .
No adjustment was made for errors of allocation in Nashua 5 and Manchester 6 .
If you make a presumed adjustment for the reported reason because you are only interested in ballot misreads , subtract 288 from 1057 = 769 .
The misread rate is then 0.950 % or one in every hundred ballots .
And thats the lowest it could be .
Assume you have 20 ballots , two are misread , but one misread is an Obama positive and a Clinton negative , and the other is an Obama negative and a Clinton positive .
You still have errors , but the net effect yields a correct result .
That 's why I say that the error rate is a best case .
The only way to determine true error rates is to choose multiple samples of 1000 ballots , and run them through several machines , each several times , and record the results of each read , and compare the results with multiple handcounts .

Who contributes on the Dennis4 President donations webpage ?
Answer : NO - ONE - BECAUSE NO ONE CAN !!!??
PLEASE GET THE WORD OUT ON THIS ...
I just donated to Dennis @ Act Blue for Dennis for President because I can't donate at the Kucinich 4 President site - No one can !!!!
The Kucinich4 President site will NOT take donations .
I tried doing this 3x's over a 2 mo .
span & kept getting the same message : THE ADDRESS I PROVIDED DOES NOT MATCH THE ADDRESS MY CREDIT CARD COMPANY HAS .
I contacted my card company last night & they assure me that there is nothing on their end that indicates I even tried to donate , as in an authorization , & the address I provided is , in fact , the right one .
Another thing is the in - person person on the contact page to call in lieu of on - line donating , which I also utilized , did not put my payment through .
I made that $ 100 donation maybe as long as some 2 months ago & a recent check of all my statements indicate that I never was billed .
We need Dennis in the White House , now more than ever - PLEASE SPREAD THE WORD & get people to donate again & to do it through Act Blue for Dennis 4 President or any venue but the Kucinich4 President contributions site until this gets straighted out .
Thanks .

And once again WMUR is lying through it 's teeth :
http://www.wmur.com/news/15122247/detail.html
I 'd like to know ' leftisbest ' ' impeccable sources ' re ' money ran out ' ; if I remember correctly , it was posted here that Kucinich paid the entire amount before the deadline and Howard got Gardner to give him a pass re the deadline because of a wire transfer issue .
Someone sent me a word doc snapshot of Hillsborough precincts from the NH SOS site and my counting came up with 80,125 votes initially and 78,343 after the recount ; no matter which numbers are correct , my counting or Brett 's , the point about accuracy is valid .
Now if NH law re certifying voting systems says that such voting systems must conform to the 2005 VVSG , then these systems are being used illegally just on the basis of error rate .
If not , then NH citizens are just screwed .

... DrVolin I think your analysis is incorrect for two reasons .
First , you do not differentiate between ballot counting errors and tabulation errors .
I think you should exclude the outliers of Nashua 5 and Manchester 5 from your analysis .
Secondly , you should differentiate between the hand count and the machine precincts .
If we knew how many counting machines were actually used at every precinct , we could then see whether there is a relationship between accuracy of machines and voter volume .
I suspect that there is also a human component to the machine reading , so that the larger the volume , fewer ballot scan errors as caused by humans - the machine - caused error rates should theoretically not change - ceteris paribus .
Finally , I think it more appropriate to use the error rate rather than the number of ballot errors , and use the logn of ballot volume .
That way you may be able to see an asymmetric relationship more clearly , or more easily see randomness .

Voter confidence is so essential and New Hampshire is just the beginning of the road to the White House .
We 've got to study this closer .
I would think people would be willing to donate money if funds were the problem .
I have n't seen Kuscinich or any groups sending out requests for help .
Not only is voter confidence essential , we 're suppose to be an example of Democracy to the rest of the world .
If we can't do it right , how can we expect others to ?

Thanks Brad for your great work in reporting on this very important issue .
This is the only site in the entire internet universe ( or other ) that seems to be really reporting on the full data .
Over at the DKos site , they all are under the delusion that the NH recount went perfectly with no errors --- except a few extra votes for Hillary --.
This is how they think over there .
Boy are they going to be surprised when Mitt Romney becomes the next President .
I hope something can be done to help Dennis Kucinich continue to push forward with a full Statewide Recount .
Unfortunately , various Corporations and press are targeting him in Cleveland to try and unseat him from Congress now .
He may have to devote his attention on political survivial right now .
What is the procedure in which NH would itself pay for the Recount - ?
If the GOP side shows problems , can that trigger an automatic recounting of the Democratic side as well ?
I know the State wants to do nothing .
But there must be some rule about this ..no ?

I sent a little contribution to Dennis the other night to help out , even though I do n't support him for Pres .
I sure do admire what he has tried to do here though .
Some people thought he hasd already paid the whole amount .
It is my recollection that he paid a small deposit which was accepted and the count begun .
The question becomes , why has he not paid the rest if this is the hold up ?
If he is short , why has he not asked for help and provided a way for us to help ?
I think LOTS of people would like to see this thing clarified .
I would think the people of NH would like to see this thing done .
It will never be done until ALL the votes are counted .

it would be disappointing , at best , if Kucinich failed to finish what he so appropriately began .
Considering the Brad Blog seems to think this issue was so important ( and it was and still is ) it 's amazing to me that this site did n't offer up any support for DK !
Where was the link to DK 's website where you could have made a contribution ?
Oh Yeah , that 's right there was n't one !!
You expect the guy with the least amount of cash to pay for this thing - then make no effort to help raise money for it - and then try to lay the entire blame on DK !!
It a shame to see this blog use the right wing " mentality " to blame the one guy in the race who has been trying to do the right thing for the people .
[ ED NOTE :
We did , in fact , give the link to make donations for the Kucinich recount .
The Kucinich folks asked us to put a phone number there instead .
Nonetheless , they also know that we were not going to go to full public bat for * anybody * unless it was made clear that they were taking the recount seriously , for example , by demanding public records the way Albert Howard did when he filed for his count .
The Kucinich folks know full well that we 're here and ready to help them in any way needed , if they make clear they are going to the mat to do a proper reconciliation / recount .
Money was never the issue , which they know .

From what I understand Kucinich paid $ 27,000 for a partial re-count .
Albert Howard requested a full statewide re-count and paid $ 57,000 to the SoS .
I was told today , by people on the ground , Kuicinich 's partial request was finished today , and that was the words from the Secretary of State , himself , in an press conference earlier today .
The Republicans were getting frustrated because the SoS said he did n't have enough people to start the Republican re-count while doing the Democrat re-count .

Kucinch has incurred legal fee from fighting the EVIL Reactor Waste manufacturer GE and their puppet BSNBC .
He also has been in court in Texas to defend his right not to sign a loyalty oath , which is actually a conflict of interests as he is a Super Delegate .
He is doing the most for democracy of any of the candidate of any other Senator .
Now he is being harassed by corporations in Cleveland .
Yet he continue to speak for sanity and draft resolutions to rid us of the treasonous criminals in the White House .
Have n't we had enough evidence that our election system is FUBAR ?
Will you enjoy voting for the candidate equivalents of Mc Donalds , Hardees , and Dairy Queen ?

And I need your help to make sure that I stay in Congress Right now I 'm under attack by corporate interests , most of them from the city of Cleveland , who have an agenda , that has nothing to do with the people of my community nor with most people in this country
And so , what I 'm asking you to do , to help me stay in Congress , so that I can continue to represent the people of my community , the state of Ohio and the United States of America I need you , right now , to go to that place on the website , where you can contribute

Though it seems odd that they allowed Dennis to pay for only part of the recount and Albert Howard ( in place of Ron Paul ) had to pay for the entire recount at once .
Anyway , vote rigging , yet another infringement on our rights by the gov't .
Add it to the ever - growing list of violations :
They violate the 1st Amendment by opening mail , caging demonstrators and banning books like America Deceived ( book ) from Amazon .
They violate the 2nd Amendment by confiscating guns during Katrina .
They violate the 4th Amendment by conducting warrant - less wiretaps .
They violate the 5th and 6th Amendment by suspending habeas corpus .
They violate the 8th Amendment by torturing .
They violate the entire Constitution by starting 2 illegal wars based on lies and on behalf of a foriegn gov't .

The only way I see to get the fee returned is to either have the result changed or that a candidate is entitled , through the recount , to one more delegate or qualifies for federal funding .
If Kucinich were to get any of the above due to a recount , then he would have fee returned .
Same for Ron Paul .
Unfortunately , I do n’t see any recourse for out and out failure of the voting machines or system .
Although not having machines up to federal standards might be considered under criminal law and the victim should have recourse to compensation , you ’d think .
It should be in Kucinich ’s best interest to continue and it is very interesting that he ’s now being hounded on many fronts at this time .
Does anyone know if they only count votes in the recounts by party or if they recount all the votes on the ballots , regardless of party ?

After a bit more thought on ballot error rates , I contend that you cannot strictly use the NH recount data AS - IS and believe that the error rate is a direct reflection of problems .
That 's because an error read on a single ballot may or may not actually result in transfer of a ballot .
Suppose a single misread .
It either incorrectly only removes a vote from one intended contender ( a single count error ) , or it removes a vote for one candidate AND adds the vote to another candidate ( a dual count error ) .
Thus , in the second case , you actually have a net difference of two votes .
So if you take my error rate from # 13 ( 1.305 % ) that presumes that all errors are single read errors .
If they were all dual read errors , the correct error rate would be 0.6525 % .
This is still unacceptable , but maybe more " reasonable " .

One of the reasons this province of Alberta 's Members of Parliament & the Provincial Legislature are Conservative majorities , is because of the state of the economy here .
All of the Oil interests are foreign owned in the Province of Alberta .

In the 1960s , Dr. Peter Witt gave spiders various kinds of drugs and alcohol to observe the effects on their webs .
The results were pretty interesting .
JACKSONVILLE , North Carolina ( CNN ) --
Police believe they have found the remains of a missing Marine buried in the backyard of the prime suspect in the case and blood spatter evidence inside his home , authorities said Friday evening .
Investigators search for the body of Lance Cpl. Maria Lauterbach Friday .
Tests found the " trace of violent activity in the house " and " evidence of an attempted cleanup , " said Onslow County Sheriff Ed Brown .
Investigators are treating the death of Lance Cpl. Maria Lauterbach as a murder , Brown added .
Lauterbach , 20 -- who was eight months pregnant -- was reported missing from Camp Lejeune , North Carolina , by her mother December 19 .
Cpl. Cesar Armando Laurean , whom Lauterbach had accused of rape , is the suspected killer , and is being sought , Brown said .
He confirmed that Laurean had left a note , but did not divulge what it said .
Investigators told CNN , however , that Laurean left a note to his wife saying Lauterbach had committed suicide and that he buried the body .
" Evidence now is saying what he 's claiming happened did not happen like he said it happened , " Brown said .
Authorities searching Laurean 's home found a cavity in his backyard earlier Friday .
A preliminary investigation indicated a " suspicious situation , " prompting police to secure the scene and wait for daylight Saturday .

" We think that we have found what would be the skeletal remains [ of Lauterbach ] , " Onslow County District Attorney Dewey Hudson told reporters .
While authorities will not know for sure until Saturday , " there are certainly some strong indicators that there are human remains " buried in the cavity , he said .
" It does n't take a rocket scientist to understand if there 's a cavity out back and blood on the inside , that 's probably going to be a key location for where this crime may have taken place , " Brown said .
He also hinted that investigators have uncovered more twists in the case .
" I do think this case is going to be a bizarre ending , and when I say bizarre , more than just a death and a burial . "
Brown stunned reporters earlier in the day by opening a press conference with the announcement : " She is dead , and she is buried . "
Watch Brown describe the cavity »
Laurean , a 21 - year - old from Nevada , is believed to have left the Marine base about 4 a.m. Friday , driving a black Dodge pickup with North Carolina license plate TRR1522 , Brown said .
He repeatedly refused to meet with investigators , finally telling them that his attorney would n't let him .
The sheriff was downcast at a midday news conference .
" These cases , investigations , become personal .
I just want to cry , " he said .
" I 'm telling you , at this point , I 'm down , way down . "

Mary Lauterbach reported her daughter missing after being unable to contact her .
She said she last spoke to her December 14 .
In a handwritten note , the Lauterbach family in Vandalia , Ohio , mourned their loss .
" We would like to thank everyone for their prayers in this time of grieving , " the note said .
" Maria has been a gift for her family and friends .
The outpouring of love from family , friends , neighbors and the general community has been very touching .
" Please understand that the family needs time alone to deal with this tragedy .
We wish to thank everyone for their love and concern . "
" They 're having a very difficult time dealing with this , " said Peter Steiner , a Kentucky psychiatrist who is Maria Lauterbach 's uncle and Mary Lauterbach 's brother .
" They remained hopeful , and really , although everyone knew it was a possibility , it was very difficult when it became apparent . "
Brown said a witness came forward Friday morning with a statement and evidence that convinced authorities Lauterbach was dead .
Brown would n't name the witness , or describe Lauterbach 's cause of death , except to say she died " from an injury . "
Asked whether the witness was in protective custody , Brown said the person does not feel the need for protective custody , as Laurean likely left the county and possibly the state .
A source close to the investigation told CNN the witness is Laurean 's wife .
Lauterbach 's relatives believe the pregnancy was the result of the alleged rape , Steiner said .
A reporter who asked military officials why Laurean had n't been taken into custody after Lauterbach reported the alleged rape was told there were indications that Lauterbach and Laurean carried on " some sort of friendly relationship " after she filed the complaint against him .
" The information developed over the last 24 hours leads us to believe that she still had some kind of contact " with him , said Paul Ciccarelli , agent in charge of the Naval Criminal Investigative Service at Camp Lejeune .
Because of that , Laurean was n't considered a flight risk , he said .
Steiner disputed that , saying his niece had no relationship with Laurean .
Ciccarelli also said the rape investigation is still active .

Lauterbach disappeared before she was able to testify at an Article 32 hearing -- a kind of military grand jury -- about the sexual assault .
Earlier Friday , Brown said a Marine who returned to North Carolina from California -- Sgt. Daniel Durham , 20 , in whose home Lauterbach had been living for a short time -- was questioned , but does not appear to have any link to the death .
Lauterbach had rented a room in Durham 's home , off the base , because she had been subjected to repeated harassment by the Marines after reporting the alleged rape , Steiner said .
Her car had been keyed and an anonymous person had " slugged " her in the face , he said .
Lauterbach 's cell phone was found on a roadside near Camp Lejeune on December 20 .
Her car was found Monday in the parking lot of a fast - food restaurant and had apparently been there since December 15 , Brown said .
A bus ticket to El Paso , Texas , was bought in Lauterbach 's name on the same day , but Brown said it was never used .

Investigators have said a withdrawal from Lauterbach 's bank account was made on December 14 , and there was " suspicious activity " on the account 10 days later .
Lauterbach and her mother last spoke about 2:30 p.m. the day Lauterbach disappeared , Steiner said .
At the time , she had experienced some contractions .
" She was ready to have that baby . "
His niece " was an energetic , very athletic , beautiful young lady .
She was a person that we 're all dearly , dearly going to miss , " he said .

BedZED in Surrey is a current example of an eco-development
The restriction is among proposals designed to minimise the environmental impact of the settlements .
Government sources say the new town centres are to be car - free , and the 15 mph limit will be enforced on " key roads " leading into them .
Environmental protesters have criticised the scheme for focusing too narrowly on carbon emissions .
' Revolutionary living '
More than 50 bids to create the zero- carbon developments have been entered by companies .
Housing minister Caroline Flint will set out standards expected of them later this week and the announcement of the shortlist of 10 new towns is expected in the coming weeks .
Ms Flint said : " These developments will be exemplars for the rest of the world , not just the rest of the country .
It 's critical that we get it right - and I make no apology for setting the bar as high as possible .
" We have a unique opportunity to deliver a programme which will genuinely revolutionise the way people live . "
Ms Flint has said she wants to see towns designed around pedestrians , cyclists and public transport users .
Protests
Environmental protesters say the plans do not give adequate consideration to other ecological issues , such as the impact building would have on wildlife .
Up to five eco -towns are expected to be built by 2016 , and up to 10 by 2020 .
They will have populations of around 5,000 to 20,000 and be linked to larger towns and cities .
There have been nationwide protests over the plans from residents who claim the schemes will put too much pressure on local services .
Opposition has been voiced in places such as Grovewood in south Derbyshire and Stoughton in Leicestershire .
Last month around 300 campaigners marched against plans for a 6,000 - home development in Long Marston , near Stratford , Warwickshire .
Computing Thoughts
The Mythical 5 %
by Bruce Eckel
December 28 , 2007
Summary
In November , I gave the commencement address for Neumont University , a school in Salt Lake City dedicated to teaching computer science where my coauthor lectures .
This is that speech .
Advertisement
So here you are , about to be unleashed upon the world .
This is a lot like taking someone and teaching them all the parts of English speech and then saying " go out and write stories , " but it 's probably all any school can do .
And a more theoretical background would n't help ; this is not to say theory is bad because you 'll need some eventually but there 's a recent movement that preaches " practice before theory " and I , apparently like Neumont , find that knowing how to do something is very helpful when trying to understand the theory behind it -- for me , the theory takes a lot longer to grasp and it's very useful to be able to be functional while my brain is catching up .
There 's only so much you can learn in school , and it 's only tenuously connected with what you will end up doing in your work .
So I 'm going to try to soften the blow a little , and arm you with a few insights that will help when you crash into the actual world of software development .
You 've come from very structured learning .
We even call it a science .
It promises that there will be the same kind of structure and activities in the world .
More importantly , you 've come to expect a certain high level of success , similar to what you 've experienced with your projects and assignments .
But the world will not behave .
The statistics are sobering : 50 - 80 % of programming projects fail .
These numbers are so broad because people do n't brag about their failures , so we have to guess .
In any event , this makes the world sound pretty unreliable .
Engineering gets better results , mostly because it has to .
Bad software usually just annoys people but bad engineering can kill .
An even more fascinating metric is this : 5 % of programmers are 20 x more productive than the other 95 % .
If this were a science , like it claims , we could figure out how to get everyone to the same level .
Let 's say that this follows the 80 - 20 rule .
Roughly 80 % of programmers do n't read books , do n't go to conferences , do n't continue learning , do n't do anything but what they covered in college .
Maybe they 've gotten a job in a big company where they can do the same thing over and over .
The other 20 % struggle with their profession : they read , try to learn things , listen to podcasts , go to user group meetings and sometimes a conference .
80 % of this 20 % are not very successful yet ; they 're still beginning , still trying .
The other 20 % of this 20 % -- that 's about 5 % of the whole who are 20 x more productive .
So how do you become one of these mythical 5 % ?
These people are not those who can remember all the moves and have fingers that fly over the keyboard erupting system commands .
In my experience those in the 5 % must struggle to get there , and struggle to stay there , and it's the process of continuous learning that makes the difference .
Because of what I do , I 've met more than my share of these people .
They read a lot , and are always ready to tackle a new concept if it looks worthwhile .
I think if they do go to conferences they 're very selective about it .
Most of their time is spent being productive , figuring things out .
The big issue is knowing that you 're going after that 20 x productivity increase .
Which means getting leverage on everything you do .
Never just " bashing something out , " but using the best tools , techniques , and ideas at your disposal .
Always doing your best .
And deeper than that , understanding that the leverage point does n't always come from the obvious thing , or from what we 've been told , or the commonly - held belief about what works .
Being able to analyze and understand a situation and discover the hinge points of a problem is essential ; this takes a clear mind and detached perspective .
For example , sometimes the choice of programming language makes a huge difference , but often , it 's relatively unimportant .
Regardless , people will still spend all their time on one decision while something else might actually have a far greater influence .
Architectural decisions , for example .
So you must learn continuously and teach yourself new technologies , but it 's not that simple .
It 's definitely good to learn more about programming , but you can't just learn more about programming .
For example , just in the world of code , here are two of the biggest pain points :
Code is read much more than it is written .
If people can't read your story , they can't improve it or fix it .
Unreadable code has a real cost , and we call it " technical debt . "
Code reviews are the most effective ways to find software defects , and yet we usually " do n't have time for them . "
Coming from the world of ones and zeroes we'd like to believe that things are deterministic , that we can provide a set of inputs and get the same outputs every time .
I know because I believed this for a long time , and it took some hard knocks when I was a physics undergraduate to begin -- only to begin -- to wake me up .
Many years later I was in a workshop and one of the other attendees told me what I had been learning all those years ; she said " All models are wrong .
Some are useful . "
We are in a young business .
Primitive , really -- we do n't know much about what works , and we keep thinking we 've found the silver bullet that solves all problems .
As a result , we go through these multi- year boom and bust cycles as new ideas come in , take off , exceed their grasp , then run out of steam .
But some ideas seem to have staying power .
For example , a lot of the ideas in agile methodologies seem to be making some real impacts in productivity and quality .
This is because they focus more on the issues of people working together and less on technologies .
A man I 've learned much from , Gerald Weinberg , wrote his first couple of books on the technology of programming .
Then he switched , and wrote or coauthored 50 more on the process of programming , and he is most famous for saying " no matter what they tell you , it 's always a people problem . "
Usually the things that make or break a project are process and people issues .
The way that you work on a day - to - day basis .
Who your architects are , who your managers are , and who you are working with on the programming team .
How you communicate , and most importantly how you solve process and people problems when they come up .
The fastest way to get stuck is to think that it 's all about the technology and to believe that you can ram your way through the other things .
Those other things are the most likely ones to stop you cold .
In my first jobs , I saw lots of managers making stupid decisions , and so , logically , I came to the conclusion that managers and management was stupid .
It 's a commonly held belief in our profession : if you 're not smart enough to deal with the technology , you go into management .
Over time I very slowly learned that the task of management was n't stupid , it 's just very , very hard .
That 's why all those stupid decisions are still being made ; management is much harder than technology because it involves virtually no deterministic factors .
It 's all guesswork , so if you do n't have good intuition you 'll probably make stupid decisions .
Napoleon wanted lucky generals rather than smart ones .
Here 's an example : some companies have adopted a policy where at the end of some predetermined period each team evaluates everyone and drops the bottom 10 % or 20 % .
In response to this policy , a smart manager who has a good team hires extra people who can be thrown overboard without damaging the team .
I think I know someone to whom this happened at Novell .
It 's not a good policy ; in fact it 's abusive and eats away at company morale from within .
But it 's one of the things you probably did n't learn here , and yet the kind of thing you need to know , even if it seems to have nothing directly to do with programming .
Here 's another example : People are going to ask you the shortest possible time it takes to accomplish a particular task .
You 'll do your best to guess what that is , and they 'll assume you can actually do it .
What you need to tell them for an estimate like this , and for all your estimates , is that there 's a 0 % probability that you will actually get it done in that period of time , that such a guess is only the beginning of the probability curve .
Each guess needs to be accompanied by such a probability curve , so that all the probabilities combined produce a real curve indicating when the project might likely be done .
You can learn more about this by reading a small book called Waltzing with Bears .
You need to pay attention to economics and business , both of which are far - from - exact sciences .
Listen to books and lectures on tape while you commute .
Understanding the underlying business issues may allow you to detect the fortunes of the company you 're working for and take action early .
When I first started working I looked askance at people who paid attention to business issues -- that was suit stuff , not real technology .
But those people were the smart ones .
A great new source of information is podcasts .
Anyone can do these so many of them are bad , but there are some real gems out there , podcasts that specifically cover topics in our profession .
I learn a lot from these , and they help me stay current .
Here 's another thing you probably did n't learn here .
Both the world of business and the world of programming is legendary for flailing about with fads that promise to get things done better .
The easy fads are patently ridiculous , or become so in short order .
The harder ones to spot contain some reason or truth that prevents you from quickly dismissing them .
Sometimes you need to pick out the good stuff and throw the rest away , and to do this you need to exercise critical thinking .
I saw a grocery bag that said " studies show children and teens who eat dinner with their families at least 5 times a week are 50 % less likely to use alcohol . "
The bag 's conclusion was to start eating dinner together and that will prevent alcoholism .
Is eating dinner together the dominant factor ?
Or is there something else that causes both eating dinner together and reduced alcoholism ?
Here are some more which many people have seriously believed :
Companies do n't have to make a profit anymore .
It 's the new economy .
Real estate always goes up , even if salaries do n't .
Or even : A university must be a traditional campus and not an office building .
It 's even harder when you come from the world of ones and zeros where we really , really want to believe that everything can be deterministic .
It 's harder than that when you understand that adding people into the mix and scaling up a system changes the dominant factors , while everyone around you still believes it should all be deterministic .
There 's a book that uses studies to debunk beliefs about managing people and projects ; it happens to be software - based but the thinking could be applied almost everywhere .
This book is called Peopleware ; it 's small and fun to read and I recommend it to almost everyone .
Alas , it really is n't a book of answers , it just firmly destroys many closely - held ideas about how people work in business situations that involve programming .
The best thing about it is that it reminds you how easy it is to take a wrong idea and build a bad world around it .
It helps you ask questions .
So when you go into your new job with your head filled with technical knowledge from the last couple of years , and you add what I 've told you today , you may be tempted to assume that everyone at the company has foolishly gotten themselves trapped with bad ideas .
But there 's one more very important maxim from Gerald Weinberg which does n't really answer anything as much as gives you a way to understand what happens .
He says : " Things are the way they are because they got that way ... one logical step at a time . "
It 's the legendary frog in the saucepan .
So from your fresh new perspective things might look ridiculous , but remember that each decision on the way was made by someone weighing the issues and making what seemed like the best choice at the time .
This viewpoint does n't solve the problem but it can make you more compassionate about the people who are stuck there .
You 'll need to make a lot of mistakes in order to figure things out .
So be humble , and keep asking questions .
Talk Back !

House Judiciary seeks speedy ruling in contempt case against Bolten , Miers
The House General Counsel 's Office , which is representing the Judiciary Committee in a civil contempt lawsuit against White House chief of staff Josh Bolten and former White House counsel Harriet Miers , has asked a federal judge to set up an expedited schedule to resolve portions of the case , a schedule that would require a ruling by this summer , according to court documents filed today .
The Justice Department , which is representing Bolten and Miers in the case , countered that the only reason the Judiciary Committee is seeking a speedy determination of the case is so that it " recommence prior to Congress ' August recess " its investigation into the firing of nine U.S. attorneys in 2006 .
The Justice Department wants a slower review of the contempt case , and it is already warning that it may appeal any ruling that goes against it .
In its filing , the House said it intended to seek " partial summary judgment " against Bolten and Miers " at this stage of the litigation " on two issues : first , that Miers failed to even appear in response to a Judiciary Committee subpoena seeking information or documents she might have on the prosecutor purge ; and second , the failure of Bolten or Miers to provide a " privilege log when withholding documents ' on the grounds of executive privilege .
President Bush asserted executive privilege in refusing to allow Bolten and Miers to appear before , or turn over internal White House documents to , the Judiciary Committee on the firings .
The Justice Department has refused to bring criminal contempt charges against Bolten and Miers , relying on DOJ opinions stating that it cannot do so in such cases .
As an alternative , the Judiciary Committee filed its own civil action against Bolten and Miers .
" The Committee seeks to resolve this litigation expeditiously so that it can obtain the information sought by the subpoenas , complete its investigation , and take any resulting legislative action before the 110th Congress ends in January 2009 , " the General Counsel 's Office stated in its filing today .
The House lawyers envision having all arguments completed by May 14 , making it likely that U.S District Judge John D. Bates would rule by the end of the summer .
The Justice Department , in its own motion , stated that the case " raises complex constitutional issues ... that bear on inter - branch relationships and on the operations of the executive branch at its highest levels . "
The Justice Department blamed the House for " any purported concern about timing , " pointing out that the Congress could have moved at any point since July 2007 to bring a contempt action against Bolten and Miers .
Instead , the Democratic leadership waited eight months before forcing a floor vote on contempt resolutions against Bolten and Miers , due in part to concerns from some rank - and - file Democrats over the wisdom of such a move .
DOJ also noted that that the loser in the District Court is likely to appeal , " thereby casting doubt on whether there will be any final resolution ... even before the August recess . "
The Justice Department said that Bolten and Miers can file their own motions against the lawsuit , which could further delay the case , and that federal rules in civil cases normally grant the government more time to respond to the initial complaint .
DOJ is asking that Bates to adopt a slower schedule under which all motions would be heard no later than July 2 , making it much less likely that there would be a ruling by the fall .
Bates is set to speak to both sides about their proposed schedules on Friday .
Occasionally there are changes coming down the pipe that even non-politicos do n’t like .
Usually , the only ones that draw ire from the “ average ” citizen are those that are widespread and hit close to home .
California has proposed a policy that so neatly fits both categories that people like my wife ( a probable Obama voter ! ) respond in shock and disbelief .
From their Energy Commission ’s newly - proposed rules about your thermostat ( PDF , see pages 63 - 64 ) :
( c) Thermostats .
All unitary heating and / or cooling systems including heat pumps that are not controlled by a central energy management control system ( EMCS ) shall have a Programmable Communicating Thermostat ( PCT ) that is certified by the manufacturer to the Energy Commission to meet the requirements of Subsections 112 ( c ) ( 1 ) and 112 ( c ) ( 2 ) below : 1 . Setback Capabilities .
All PCTs shall have a clock mechanism that allows the building occupant to program the temperature set points for at least four periods within 24 hours .
Thermostats for heat pumps shall meet the requirements of Section 112 ( b ) .
2 . Communicating Capabilities .
All PCTs shall be distributed with a non-removable Radio Data System ( RDS ) communications device that is compatible with the default statewide DR communications system , which can be used by utilities to send price and emergency signals .
PCTs shall be capable of receiving and responding to the signals indicating price and emergency events as follows .
A. Price Events .
The PCT shall be shipped with default price - event offsets of + 4 °F for cooling and - 4 °F for heating enabled ; however , customers shall be able to change the offsets and thermostat settings at any time during price events .
Upon receiving a price - event signal , the PCT shall adjust the thermostat setpoint by the number of degrees indicated in the offset for the duration specified in the signal of the price event .
The PCT shall also be equipped with the capability to allow customers to define setpoints for heating and cooling in response to price signals as an alternative to temperature - offsetting response , as described in Reference Joint Appendix JA5 .
B. Emergency Events .
Upon receiving an emergency signal , the PCT shall respond to commands contained in the emergency signal , including changing the setpoint by any number of degrees or to a specific temperature setpoint .
The PCT shall not allow customer changes to thermostat settings during emergency events .
If for any reason the state - regulated utilities deem that there is an “ emergency ” , they can do anything they want to your air conditioner or heater , and the thermostat gives you NO ability to override the setting .
It does n’t matter if you ’ve got an elderly person sweltering in the summer heat in the central valley who cannot handle a few hours in extreme temperatures , you cannot change the thermostat .
Of course , this is n’t new technology .
In fact , the utilities were offering discounts to those buyers who voluntarily installed these thermostats .
But I ’m guessing either not enough people were adopting them for the nannies in Sacramento , or the utilities got tired of TOO MANY people adopting the technology , and wanted it mandated so they would n’t have to offer discounts .
Now , this is all an effort to mitigate the effects of high power draw in the hot summer months , when people are running their air conditioners which are often fitted by Air Conditioning experts .
Reducing power draw is as easy as replacing your filter regularly , it ’s not rocket science to order a 16x25x1 air conditioner filter online .
Reducing the high power draw being used by people in the heat might be something that needs to be done , especially because of how many people in the country will be using their system all at the same time .
However , there are other ways around this .
Buying a new air conditioner filter can sometimes be the way forward , but some other people might just be experiencing problems with their system .
To improve the performance of your HVAC system , you might want to consider looking at California or even Portland air duct cleaning .
No matter where you live , you ’ll want to improve your HVAC to try and keep the power draw down .
However , we end up with thermostats instead , because in the past , these situations have resulted in rolling blackouts and much political strife from the constituents .
Those of us who have some economic sense and a history of California would point out that most of the woes this is intended to solve are the unintended consequences of California ’s royally incompetent regulation and “ de”regulation of their energy sector .
Screwy regulatory hurdles , NIMBYism , and lobbying have resulted in a system which has completely destroyed any semblance of a market , and artificially limited increases in supply which might have kept electricity plentiful and prices low .
Instead of fixing the problem , they ’re simply adding another layer .
There ’s still time to put a stop to this .
If you live in California , contact the “ process administrator ” of these proceedings , Chris Gekas .
Or your local legislator .
Any complaint needs to be registered by January 30th , or this thing will go through without a problem .
Of course , there ’s always the chance that it will go through anyway .
If that occurs , my plan is good old - fashioned civil disobedience .
If my next home has one of these installed , I will order a thermostat from out - of - state or– given that I ’m an electrical engineer– find a way to disable the radio .
The State of California may mandate this sort of idiocy , but it ’s too bloated and inefficient to enforce it ( once you get through an initial building inspection ) , so I would recommend others do the same .
When the rest of the state is sweltering through a hot summer day without A/C , those of us who still value freedom can invite our neighbors over and explain to them the folly of big government .

INDIANAPOLIS ( Reuters ) - Republican presidential hopeful John McCain said on Friday he was not concerned over the possibility of severe campaign funding restraints from the agency that oversees money in U.S. politics .

REUTERS / Brent Smith
McCain -- the likely Republican nominee in November ’s presidential election -- was told by the Federal Election Commission on Thursday that he might be required to use public funding and so abide by its accompanying spending limits until September when he formally would be anointed the Republican Party candidate .
That could sharply limit his ability to buy advertising and campaign while Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama -- still locked in their contest for the Democratic nomination -- are raising millions of dollars and appealing to voters nationwide .
The letter on funding is further bad news for the Arizona senator .
McCain on Thursday denied a New York Times report he had an improper relationship with a lobbyist , and on Friday one of his campaign ’s co-chairs in Arizona , Republican Rep.
Rick Renzi , was indicted on fraud and extortion charges stemming from land deals in his state .
But at a campaign stop in Indiana , McCain replied with a dismissive “ no ” when asked if he was concerned by the FEC ’s letter .
“ It ’s not a decision .
It ’s an opinion , according to our people , ” he said .
McCain , the author of a prominent law that limits money in politics , asked the FEC for public money last year at a time when his campaign was in deep trouble .
He was nearly out of cash and was forced to take out a bank loan to finance his presidential bid .
His fund - raising has since picked up as he won a string of state party nominating contests in the last two months and become the Republican front - runner .
The public financing system was created in the 1970s after the Watergate scandal revealed the extent of campaign financing shenanigans and ended with the resignation of Republican President Richard Nixon .
It is financed by taxpayers who check a box on their tax returns .
McCain opted out of the system earlier this month because he has nearly reached the FEC ’s $ 54 million spending cap for the primary season and expects to raise more money .
But FEC Chairman David Mason told McCain the commission may not approve the Arizona senator ’s request because four of the commission ’s six seats remain unfilled due to a standoff between the Senate and President George W. Bush .
Mason also said the FEC needs to review whether the terms of McCain ’s bank loan might have violated commission guidelines by pledging its expected matching funds as collateral .
He asked for a reply by March 7 .
McCain has accused Obama of rolling back on a pledge to limit himself to $ 85 million in public money for the general election if he is the Democratic nominee .
Obama , who has raised over $ 140 million so far , has refused to recommit to the pledge , which he made in February 2007 .
BBC Arabic TV hopes to attract 20 million viewers by 2010
Behind the scenes
The channel is free to everyone in North Africa and the Middle East with a satellite or cable connection .
It will distinguish itself from other state - funded channels by reporting " without fear or favour " , BBC World Service director Nigel Chapman said .
This is the BBC 's second attempt at an Arabic channel .
The first closed in 1996 in the wake of an editorial dispute with its Saudi funders .
The channel enters a crowded market , dominated by the Qatar - based al - Jazeera and the Saudi - funded al - Arabiya channels .
Recent TV channels financed by Western governments have struggled to make an impact , including the US - backed al - Hurra channel in Iraq and France 24 in Arabic .
THE EDITORS ' BLOG
We believe we can be distinctive , offering an international perspective
Richard Sambrook ,
director , BBC Global News
Richard 's comments in full
" BBC Arabic is renowned for broadcasting impartial and accurate news and information which is strong on analysis and expertise .
[ An ] enhanced multimedia service meets the needs of an audience with a very strong appetite for news and debate , " Mr Chapman has said .
Some commentators question whether the BBC can succeed in a region where the UK is criticised for its involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Publicly funded
Starting at 1000 GMT on 11 March , BBC Arabic television will broadcast 12 hours a day , shifting to a 24 - hour service later in 2008 .
Presenters : Fida Bassil , Osman Ayfarah , Lina Musharbash and Rania al - Alattar
The channel will broadcast 30 - minute news bulletins every hour and two main 60 - minute bulletins at 1800 GMT and 2000 GMT .
It will also carry interviews and debates allowing viewers to submit comments .
The service is the BBC 's first publicly - funded international TV service .
It has an annual budget of US $ 50 m ( UK £ 25 m ) .
This comes partly from a UK government grant , and partly from BBC World Service funds freed up by the closure of radio services , mainly to Eastern Europe .
It hopes to attract 20 million viewers per week by 2010 and 35 million users per week for all three Arabic services - TV , radio and on the web .
The channel will be distributed through the Arabsat , Eutelsat and Nilesat satellite systems .
Flush with cash after another record fund - raising event , the campaign of Ron Paul said Monday that it was hiring more staff members , expanding its ground operations in early primary states , planning more advertising and looking ahead to competing in the contests on Feb .

Supporters of the campaign broke a record on Sunday when they raised just over $ 6 million in an Internet campaign for Mr. Paul , a 10 - term Republican congressman from Texas whose antiwar , libertarian message has caught on with an enthusiastic and generous segment of the electorate .
It raised an additional $ 360,000 on Monday .
The donations eclipsed a previous one - day fund - raising record of $ 5.7 million , set by Senator John Kerry in 2004 after he accepted the Democratic nomination for president .
Mr. Paul ’s previous single - day fund - raising high was $ 4.2 million on Nov. 5 , raised in a campaign set up by supporters .
The latest fund - raiser was timed to the 234th anniversary of the Boston Tea Party , to underscore Mr. Paul ’s message of changing course in America .
His agenda includes pulling out of Iraq , doing away with the federal income tax and eliminating bureaucracies like the federal Department of Education .

Two men suspected of burglarizing a neighbor 's home were shot in the back by Pasadena homeowner Joe Horn after the suspects ventured into his front yard , Pasadena police disclosed Friday .
Also , for the first time , investigators revealed the Nov. 14 shooting was witnessed by a plainclothes Pasadena detective , who had pulled up in an unmarked car seconds before Horn fired three shots from his 12 - guage shotgun .
The detective 's name was not released as the new details emerged about the controversial shootings that have outraged minority activists but also brought an outpouring of support from others .
" We have now documented a summary of what we think happened .
We will turn it over to the district attorney in a couple of weeks after we finish our extensive quality control review , " said Pasadena Police Department Captain A.H. " Bud " Corbett .
The Harris County district attorney will then present the case to a grand jury to determine if any charges should be filed against Horn .
The suspects were illegal immigrants from Colombia , and one man had been deported nearly 10 years ago , authorities said .
Authorities have said they are investigating whether Diego Ortiz , 30 , and Hernando Riascos Torres , 48 , were part of a crime ring linked to burglaries and the use of fake immigration documents .
The two — killed by Horn after he said they were trying to steal his neighbor 's property — were in the country illegally , according to Leticia Zamarripa , a spokeswoman for the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement .
Horn , 61 , shot Ortiz and Torres , who went by the alias Miguel Antonio DeJesus .
Horn called police after hearing breaking glass .
He ignored an operator 's warning to not go outside with his gun .
Corbett said Torres was deported to Colombia in 1999 after a 1994 cocaine - related conviction .
He was on parole until 2017 , Corbett said .
Police found a Puerto Rican identification card on Ortiz .
He had two aliases .
Torres had identification cards from Colombia , Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic .
He had three aliases .
State and federal authorities are investigating whether the two men , who lived in southwest Houston , were involved in the crime ring , Corbett said .
Police found almost $ 2,000 in cash in a white bag the men allegedly took from the home in the 7400 block of Timberline before Horn shot them .
Investigators also are trying to determine whether the men knew about the home or family before burglarizing it .
" I do n't believe the victim was a random choice ... but there 's no evidence of a relationship either , " between the homeowners and suspects , Corbett said .
Horn told the operator that he did not know his neighbors well .
Neighbors said the family moved into the home next to Horn 's house about four months ago .
" I can't comment , " a woman at the home said over the phone Thursday night .
A source told police that Ortiz and Torres burglarized the home , in part , because the homeowners were immigrants .
" They targeted foreign - born people , " Corbett said .
" They felt they were easier victims . "
Little is known about the homeowners , who have Vietnamese surnames .
Neighbors said they own a small business near their Village Grove East subdivision .
Records filed with the Office of the Secretary of State of Texas show that the family owns a dry cleaning business on Fairmont Parkway .
Horn has received an outpouring of support from some neighbors , friends and strangers , but the incident also has outraged activists and other neighbors .
Activists and Horn supporters clashed Sunday when they staged dueling protests outside his home .
The homeowners association is trying to prevent more protests from being held in the subdivision .

UK space scientist Emeritus Professor Alan Wells is to speak at the American Association for the Advancement of Science ( AAAS ) in Boston in February on : International Cooperation in Developing Swift and its Scientific Achievements .
Professor Wells ' presentation will be on Saturday 16th February at around 11.00 a.m. as part of a symposium entitled : Worldwide Hunt to Solve the Mystery of Gamma - Ray Bursts .
In it , he will discuss the breadth of international collaborations , including the prominent contributions from UK scientists , in new discoveries about gamma ray bursts obtained from the Swift satellite and coordinated observations from a global network of ground based telescopes .
Gamma -ray bursts are short - lived events , lasting between a few milliseconds to a few minutes .
The brightest of them emit more energy in a few seconds than our Sun will emit in its whole 10 billion year lifetime .
Gamma ray bursts are occurring several times daily somewhere in the universe , fortunately at huge distances from our solar system .
These fleeting explosions are precursors to the births of black holes .
The Swift Gamma Ray Burst Explorer satellite is a NASA mission with substantial UK and Italian participation .
Swift was designed to solve the mystery of the origin of gamma ray bursts by pinpointing the burst and measuring the emissions from the huge fireball that occurs in the first few seconds of the burst 's lifetime .
Scientists at Leicester 's world - renowned Space Research Centre are part of the international team working on the Swift , having had a major role in the development of the X - ray telescope , which has been responsible for many of the discoveries made by Swift .
Since its launch in 2004 , Swift has discovered over 292 gamma-ray bursts , and pin-pointed a further 320 bursts detected by other satellites .
Swift 's rapid response - it was named after the bird , which catches its prey " on the fly " - has been critical to understanding these titanic events .
In 2007 the international Swift team , under NASA scientist Neil Gehrels and including UK scientists from the University of Leicester and the Mullard Space Science Laboratory , were awarded the prestigious Bruno Rossi Prize for major advances in the scientific understanding of gamma-ray bursts .
The prize is given each year by the High Energy Astrophysics Division ( HEAD ) of the American Astronomical Society ( AAS ) , the largest professional organization of astronomers in the United States .
This was the first time that a UK mission team has been cited for the Rossi Prize .

Public Pot Protests Set For National Road Tour
Public Pot Protests Set For National Road Tour By Julian Slade
Cannabis activists , who protest prohibition by publicy smoking marijuana at Auckland 's Albert Park , will tour 42 towns in 42 days for daily law reform rallies .
The aroma of marijuana lingers at the Victoria St East entrance to Albert Park as cannabis is openly smoked in 4:20 pm protests on Wednesdays and Fridays .
Placards with slogans such as " End the Drug War " are displayed , as is a New Zealand flag and Maryjane the cannabus - an old Bedford customised into a mobile smoking lounge and information centre - is emblazoned with drug law reform messages .

" Go to the top of Victoria St East and follow your nose , " beckons a descriptive post on the NORML ( National Organisation for the Reform of Marijuana Laws ) internet forum .
And the clouds of cannabis smoke draw passing smokers , tourists , and police to the 4.20 spot , underneath the Gateway sculpture by Chris Booth , a distinctive archway of basalt boulders .
The public pot consumption has attracted scant police attention .
The 4:20 sessions have been going for just over two years but protesters have been searched and questioned only on rare occasions and only a few arrests have been made .
However police officers swiftly appeared to confiscate a mature flowering marijuana plant the activists transplanted in a public ceremony .
For the most part , police tolerate the regular protests .
Officers in patrol cars waiting at adjacent traffic lights watch activists openly toking , then drive off .
The liberal law enforcement approach extends to cannabus sessions in Queen St on Friday and Saturday nights .
Activists say visitors over the age of 18 are invited to consume cannabis in the mobile smoking lounge and passing police patrols do n't seem too fussed .
" We 're showing the workers and residents of the city that cannabis smoking is not something evil to be ashamed of , " says self - proclaimed " daktavist " Ken Morgan ( aka Dakta Green ) , who has previously been arrested for possession at the 4.20 site .
" We 're showing pubic support for law change by smoking in public . "
He has complained to police minister Annette King , alleging harassment of political protesters after a police operation at the site on Friday February 8 .
Mr Morgan has served prison sentences in New Zealand and the United States for cannabis cultivation .
He told parole board members at his final hearing - prior to being released from prison after serving two years and eight months of a three year sentence for cultivation - that he would not grow cannabis again , but would continue smoking it and work fulltime to change cannabis laws .
He has since devoted a year of his life - starting last November and working towards this year 's elections - to fighting prohibition .
He and fellow daktavists plan to drive their cannabus south , leaving Auckland in mid March as they head to their ultimate destination of Dunedin in late April .
Along the way they 're stopping in 42 towns and cities to discuss law reform with local media , politicians and residents before staging daily 4.20 protests .
In May , the cannabus will head to Wellington , with activists planning to petition Parliament .
" What this tour is all about is protesting in the strongest possible way that New Zealand citizens who are in Parliament lock up their friends and neighbours .
Do New Zealanders want to keep locking up people who are part of the cannabis culture ? "
Mr Morgan says it 's time for New Zealanders to stand up to the United States over marijuana in the same way we did over nuclear ships : " It 's time to say the same to the evil anti-cannabis policy they impose on the rest of the world .
When countries choose to liberalise cannabis laws they threaten trade sanctions .
New Zealand Drug Foundation executive director Ross Bell called for a national discussion on cannabis in November : " And we have risen to the challenge , we 're going to have a conversation with the public about cannabis , " Mr Morgan says .
Activists drove the cannabus north and held public smoking sessions at Waitangi during the recent Waitangi Day celebrations .
In an anarchic response to occasional police searches and arrests at the 4.20 site at Albert Park activists have posted video of raids - including one where an undercover officer " busts "
Mr Morgan for what turns out to be a bag of nettle tea - on sites such as www.cannabis.com.

When you use WordPress you ’re given the choice when publishing between doing it as a ‘ post ’ or as a ‘ page ‘ .
Posts go up on your blog while ‘ pages ’ are static pages that you can publish without it having to go up on your blog .
There ’s a lot of reasons why you might choose a post over a page or a page over a post ( that ’s for another post ) – but today I thought I ’d highlight a few ‘ pages ’ that I have here on ProBlogger as examples of pages that bloggers might want to develop to promote their blog to different groups of people .
Some are more essential in my mind than others but all have been helpful in the development of my own blogs .
1. About Page – perhaps one of the most common uses of the ‘ page ’ function on WP is the good old ‘ about page ’ .
Having an about page is essential in my mind as it gives new readers to your blog a snapshot of who you are and why they should subscribe to your blog .
This is the page that I go to every time I hit a new blog – if they do n’t have one it decreases my chances of subscribing significantly .
Read more on adding an about page to your blog .
2. Contact Page – I ’m amazed how many bloggers do n’t have any way of contacting them on their blog .
While I understand the temptation not to have one you could be missing out of wonderful opportunities by not giving readers , potential partners , press , other bloggers a way of contacting you .
Read more on Why your blog ’s readers should be able to contact you .
3. Press Page – I do n’t promote this page heavily ( although do mention it on my ‘ About Page ‘ ) but use it more when interacting with journalists and mainstream media outlets .
The way I use it is to show journalists what others have written about me .
I find that in providing a list of previous articles in mainstream media you gain a little credibility and give journalists a head start in finding an angle to pursue for their own potential articles about you .
It ’s also handy to be able to provide this page to anyone else that you ’re attempting to build credibility with that may not be that ‘ new media savvy ’ .
It ’s amazing how a mention in mainstream media will open doors for some .
4. Disclaimer Page – I need to update this page but for the interests of transparency have it linked to on every page on my blog to show readers what I get out of this blog – ie that I make money from it and use affiliate programs .
I also use this page to dispel some of the myths and untrue assumptions that people have about me and this blog by sharing some of the ‘ costs ’ of this blog .
I find that this balanced ‘ disclaimer ’ works quite well .
5. FAQ Page – this page was written with a very selfish motive – to cut down my workload .
I get asked a lot of questions , many of them repeatedly .
As an attempt to answer some of these frequently asked questions I put together some answers for them .
I still get asked the questions but being able to point to this page helps .
I also have it linked to prominently from my Contact Page .
6. Subscribe Page – having a page dedicated to how people can subscribe to your blog can be very useful .
I do n’t link to this from my sidebar any more ( like I do at DPS ) but do link to it from within posts at times .
I find that having a page like this can be useful as some readers do n’t understand the idea of RSS or can be worried about issues of privacy or what it means to ‘ subscribe ’ .
Sometimes having a page dedicated to walking people through the process can pay off .
7. Advertise with Us Page – looking to sell advertising on your blog ?
An ‘ Advertise ’ page is an important part of attracting new advertisers and a well written one can cut down a lot of work for you as it ’ll help to filter out people by giving them information that helps them to know if your site is right for them .
Further Reading : Finding Advertisers for Your Blog .
8. Series Page – Compilation – I ’ve used ‘ pages ’ in two ways when it comes to series of posts .
The first way is to put together a compilation page of all of the posts in a series .
I do n’t do this that regularly but in the example linked to put together the content from all 25 posts on my series on Battling Bloggers Block .
I found that some readers really appreciated having the series all in the one place .
9. Series Page – Central Page – the other approach to managing a series of posts with a ‘ page ’ is to use one as a ‘ central links page ’ that you update with a link to each post in your series over time .
This is what I did in my 31 Days to Building a Better Blog Series last August .
The beauty of this approach over the ‘ compilation page ’ is that it can drive a lot more page views as readers are ‘ sneezed ’ in multiple directions into your blog .
It ’s also good because it allows readers to be more selective about which posts in a series they want to read rather than reading the full thing .
10 . Affiliate Pre-Sell Pages – having a dedicated page for an affiliate program that you ’re running can be a very smart move .
If you refer to a product that you ’re promoting regularly in your posts – rather than linking to the affiliate program link to a ‘ pre - sell ’ page on your own blog .
This allows you to ‘ pre- sell ’ the product more with a personal message .
This is what I do on my AdSense page here at ProBlogger .
This does n’t work for every affiliate program but I find with AdSense that it works well as their landing page can be a little off putting to new potential users of it .
It also gives me a little more flexibility with how I mention AdSense in my posts as their Referrals program does n’t allow html linking .
Further Reading : 5 Tips for Improving AdSense Referral Earnings .
11 . Services Pages –
If you offer services to readers then develop a dedicated sales page for yourself and link to it prominently on your blog .
The example here is my Consulting page – a page I used to point to regularly .
These days I do n’t offer these services any more ( due to workload ) so have not promoted it for a while .
I find that when you have a dedicated page to selling your services you can sell yourself much more expansively than just a quick mention elsewhere on your blog .
12 . Key Information Pages –
Do you have information that you ’re constantly providing to people over and over again ( whether in blog posts , via email or in other ways ) ?
Make a page about it and keep the link handy .
That ’s what I did with my b5 media page and have found it to help me cut down my workload in answering questions about the network .
I also link to it in my navigational bar here on ProBlogger and it ’s lead to some great opportunities .
You could do this with any business or product that you ’re associated with .
13 . Landing Pages – this page is an example of one over at DPS that I used last year as a landing page for an ad campaign that I ran .
If you do choose to run an ad campaign to promote your blog then it ’s much wiser to link your ads to a dedicated landing page than the front page of your blog .
Read more on Advertising Your Blog and on Landing Pages .
14 . Sneeze Pages – one great way to propel people deep within your blog is to develop a Sneeze Page or a ‘ Best of ’ page that highlights some of the better articles on your blog around a particular theme .
Put links to these pages on your sidebar or refer to them in posts and you ’ll see your page impressions per visit statistics go up .
15 . Testimonial Pages – if you ’re selling something ( even if it ’s yourself ) to have some sort of a testimonial page can be very worthwhile .
People base buying decisions increasingly upon the opinions of others – so capture some of these opinions and present them .
16 . Event Specific Pages – speaking at an event ?
Create a ‘ page ’ specifically for those at it and mention that you ’ve done so in your presentation .
This way you can tailor a specific message to those visitors , their needs , your presentation and ‘ sell ’ something to them ( whether it be subscribing to your blog , buying a product , selling your services or getting them to read certain pages on your blog .
The example I ’ve given is from a conference I did this time last year .
I also used to have a section on that page selling a product that I mentioned in the presentation and it converted quite well .
17 . 404 Page – when people arrive on your blog to a page that has been deleted , follow a dead link etc and end up on a default error page on your blog you ’ve got a wasted opportunity on your hands .
Customize your error pages to help readers find what they ’re looking for or at least find something else that might interest them .
Further Reading : How to Create a Custom 404 Error Page for Your Blog .
18 . Special Projects – Last year I participated in a charity event called ( Movember ) .
Rather than letting this event completely take over my blog for the month I created a dedicated page for the event that those who were interested in could follow my updates on .
19 . Guest Blogger Page – I ’ve never spoken publicly about this page on ProBlogger before but it ’s a page that I provide to guest bloggers of ProBlogger with some guidelines on how to write for this blog .
I ’ve done the same thing for DPS and have found that it ’s been very useful .
I get more posts that are written in a format that I can use and it ’s cut down a lot of work for me .
20 . Archives Page – there are numerous ways that you can present that archives of your blog .
It becomes more challenging the larger your blog grows to be able to direct people back to your best previous work and a dedicated page can be helpful in that process rather than just presenting a list of categories or dates on your site bar .
What I ’ve attempted to do with mine is to provide a page with dated archives but also categories with some suggested starting points .
Some of the above ‘ pages ’ can of course be created from ‘ posts ’ on your blog ( and there might be some good reasons for doing so ) however my preference is to make them ‘ pages ’ .
In most cases this is because I prefer these pages to not be date specific .
The way I have my links set up here at ProBlogger posts have dates showing and in the link structure – but pages do n’t .
In many of the above examples I also did n’t want to page to show up in my blog ’s RSS feed or categories – but preferred them to be standalone pages .
What page types would you add to the above list ?
Update : Some great suggestions in comments so far .
I agree that a privacy page is a good one , as is a comments policy ( I have one of these but wrote it as a post – I think it ’d be more appropriate as a page though ) .
Another one that I should have included is a ‘ resource ’ page – a page that lists recommended resources , books , courses etc.
Lastly – I should have included a ‘ blog roll ’ or ‘ links ’ page .
Thanks for everyone ’s suggestions – keep them coming .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - U.S. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said on Wednesday he planned to defy a threatened White House veto and try to win passage of a bill to curb rising home foreclosures by changing bankruptcy law .
“ I have no expectation of reaching any agreement with the White House , ” said Reid a day after the administration warned the bill would need changes to get President George W. Bush ’s signature .
“ I have tried for seven years ” to reach agreements with Bush on a variety of issues , but have repeatedly failed , said Reid , a Nevada Democrat , at a news conference .
“ So we are going to do what we think is best for the country , ” Reid said .
“ If we get 67 votes ( in the 100 - member Senate to override a possible Bush veto ) , that ’s great . ”
The Senate could turn to the housing bill in the next few days , but it must first overcome a possible Republican procedural hurdle that would take 60 votes to clear .
“ I think we are going to get more than 60 votes , ” said Reid , whose fellow Democrats control the Senate , 51 - 49 .
The White House on Tuesday threatened to veto the bill , which is the latest congressional response to the subprime mortgage crisis that threatens to tip the economy into recession and push many Americans out of their homes .
The measure would let bankruptcy judges erase some mortgage debt and provide billions of dollars to rehabilitate abandoned properties .
The White House said the bill was too costly and an unacceptable bailout for lenders and speculators .
It had been expected to be taken up Tuesday by the Senate , but got pushed back for consideration of an Iraq measure .
Reid said he opposed dropping the controversial provision to modify present bankruptcy law by letting bankruptcy judges erase some mortgage debt .
He said the bill has drawn support from community banks and credit unions .
However , “ the big banks , there is nothing we can do to get them to help us , ” Reid said .
“ This bankruptcy provision is fair . ”
In the House of Representatives , another key Democratic lawmaker is crafting a plan to provide about $ 15 billion to help a million troubled borrowers , an aide said on Wednesday .
House Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank , a Massachusetts Democrat , is developing the proposal which would involve the Federal Housing Administration and government purchases of distressed mortgages .
The five - year plan would apply only to owner - occupied homes and exclude investor - owned and second homes .
Frank is also working on another plan to provide as much as $ 20 billion in grants and loans to buy foreclosed or abandoned homes at or below market value .

One of the key concepts in Haskell that sets it apart from other programming languages is the concept of a " monad " .
People seem to find this difficult to learn ( I did as well ) , and as a result there are loads of monad tutorials on the web , some of which are very good ( I particularly like All About Monads by Jeff Newbern ) .
It 's even been said that writing a monad tutorial is a rite of passage for new Haskell programmers .
However , one big problem with many monad tutorials is that they try to explain what monads are in reference to existing concepts that the reader already understands ( I 've even seen this in presentations by Simon Peyton - Jones , the main author of the GHC compiler and general Haskell grand poobah ) .
This is a mistake , and I 'm going to tell you why .
It 's natural , when trying to explain what something is , to explain it by reference to things the other person already knows about .
This works well when the new thing is similar in some ways to things the other person is familiar with .
It breaks down utterly when the new thing is completely out of the experience of the person learning it .
For instance , if you were trying to explain what fire is to a caveman who had never seen a fire , what would you say ?
" It 's kind of like a cross between air and water , but hot ... "
Not very effective .
Similarly , explaining what an atom is in terms of quantum mechanics is problematic , because we know that the electron does n't _really_ orbit around the nucleus like a planet around a star , and the notion of a " delocalized electron cloud " does n't really mean much .
Feynman once said that nobody really understood quantum mechanics , and on an intuitive level that 's true .
But on a mathematical level , quantum mechanics is well - understood ; we just do n't have a good intuition for what the math really means .
How does this relate to monads ?
Time and again , in tutorials , blog posts and on the Haskell mailing lists , I 've seen monads explained in one of two supposedly - intuitive ways : a monad is " kind of like an action " or " kind of like a container " .
How can something be both an action and a container ?
Are n't these separate concepts ?
Is a monad some kind of weird " active container " ?
No , but the point is that claiming that a monad is a kind of action or a kind of container is incorrect .
So what is a monad , anyway ?
Here 's the answer : A monad is a purely abstract concept , with no fundamental relationship to anything you 've probably ever heard of before .
The notion of a monad comes from category theory , which is the most abstract branch of mathematics I know of .
In fact , the whole point of category theory is to abstract out all of the structure of mathematics to expose the similarities and analogies between seemingly disparate areas ( for instance , between algebra and topology ) , so as to condense mathematics into its fundamental concepts , and thus reduce redundancy .
( I could go on about this for quite a while , but I 'd rather get back to the point I 'm trying to make . )
Since I 'm guessing that most programmers learning Haskell do n't know much about category theory , monads are not going to mean anything to them .
That does n't mean that they need to learn all about category theory to use monads in Haskell ( fortunately ) , but it does mean that they need to get comfortable thinking about things in a more abstract way than they are probably used to .
So monads in Haskell are not actions , and they 're not containers .
Why do people use these analogies ?
It 's because a monad is such a general concept that specific kinds of monads can be thought of as actions or containers .
The IO monad can be considered to be an " action " ( a kind of function wrapped in a data structure ) .
The list monad and the Maybe monad can be considered as containers .
And there are probably other monads that can't be thought of usefully as either of these things , but as something else entirely .
So why have one " monad " concept if it describes all these radically different things ?
It 's because all these seemingly different things can have similar sets of operations that characterize how they work , even though the details of how those operations work are going to be radically different for each particular kind of monad .
In other words , there are structural similarities between all monads , even if the details of what they do is quite different .
That 's what makes it useful to have the general concept of a monad in the language in the first place ; you can provide support for one thing ( a monad ) , including syntactic support , and it will work in all these different contexts .
Warning !
I 'm going to get into a fairly detailed discussion of Haskell language features below in order to make the above discussion more concrete .
Wish me luck .
Here 's an abbreviated definition of what a monad is in Haskell , leaving out some nonessential features :
class Monad m where ( >>= ) :: m a -> ( a -> m b ) -> m b return :: a -> m a
This says that in order for m to be a monad , there must be two functions called >>= and return that have the given type signatures ( the stuff following the :: is a type signature ) .
>>= is actually a binary operator usually called " bind " , and return is a regular function of one argument .
This kind of " class " is not like the classes in C++ or Java ; it 's a type class which is a way of specifying what related types have in common .
It 's somewhat similar to the notion of an interface in Java , except that all type checking is done at compile time .
Different types can become instances of this type class by saying how they would implement the two operations >>= and return that characterize this particular type class .
As long as the implementations have the correct types , it 's allowable as an instance of the class .
Most type classes are simpler than the Monad class ; for instance , we have :
class
Eq a where ( == ) :: a -> a -> Bool ( /= ) :: a -> a ->
Bool
This says that any type a is an instance of the type class Eq ( meaning " equality " ) as long as there are definitions of two functions ( actually binary operators , but in Haskell any binary operator can also be treated as a function ) called == and /= .
The first is the " equals " operator and the second is the " not- equals " operator .
They each take two arguments of type a and return a boolean result .
The reason for the notation a -> a ->
Bool for a function of two arguments is beyond the scope of this discussion but is explained in any Haskell tutorial .
Looking back at the Monad class above , we see one peculiarity : the thing that can be made into an instance of the Monad class ( called m ) appears in the type signature concatenated to another thing called a , for instance :
return :: a -> m a
Where does the a come from ?
And what does m a mean ?
a represents an arbitrary type ( in Haskellese we say that return is a polymorphic function ) ; a more precise type signature would be this :
return :: forall a . a -> m a
So return will work on an argument of any type a , which means that the first argument can be of any type whatsoever .
However , whatever that type a is , the result of applying return to a value of that type will be a value of type m a .
That means that m is a type constructor , which is like a function on types .
m takes a type argument a and produces a new type m a ( function application in Haskell does n't use parentheses ; you just put the function name in front of its arguments , with spaces separating each entity ) .
So anything that can be a monad in Haskell first of all has to be a type constructor with a single type argument .
Common monads in Haskell include the IO monad , which does input and output , and the Maybe monad , which is useful for computations that can fail .
Both IO and Maybe are type constructors .
There is no IO type or Maybe type , but there is e.g. an IO Int type and a Maybe String type .
Let 's say I have a type constructor called Foo which takes one type argument .
That would mean that Foo Int and Foo String would be valid types .
How would I tell Haskell that Foo is a monad ?
I 'd have to supply an instance declaration for Foo which might look something like this :
instance Monad
Foo where [ definition of what return means for Foo ] [ definition of what >>= means for Foo ]
Whatever the definition of return for type
Foo a was , it would have to have the type a ->
Foo a , which means that it would take a value of type a and convert it into a value of type Foo a .
So if type a was Int , the result would have type Foo Int .
Whatever the definition of >>= for type
Foo a was , it would have to have the type Foo a -> ( a -> Foo a ) ->
Foo a , which means that the first argument to >>= has type Foo a ( a monadic value ) , the second argument has type a ->
Foo a ( a function taking a value of type a to a value of type Foo a , and the result of the function application would have type Foo a .
As far as Haskell is concerned , once you 've done all that , you have your monad .
To be a well - behaved monad ( in category theory terms ) , there are additional rules that have to be obeyed .
However , Haskell is n't powerful enough to enforce those rules , so it 's up to the programmer to do it himself .
That 's a topic for another time , but the standard monads defined in Haskell are all well - behaved in this sense .
The point I 'm trying to make is that any type constructor ( taking one type argument ) for which the return and bind functions are defined with the correct types is a monad in Haskell , regardless of whether it's " really " a kind of container , or a kind of action , or whatever .
It 's kind of like duck typing : if it looks like a monad , and acts like a monad , it is a monad .
Anything that is compatible with the above definition is a monad , and trying to find an intuitive explanation that covers all monads is fruitless .
I had a physics professor once who had trouble explaining what a tensor was .
Finally he said " a tensor is something that transforms the way a tensor does ! "
In other words , the thing is defined by its behavior ( represented by the equations it has to satisfy ) , not by any intuitive notions .
I realize that I have n't said anything whatsoever about what monads are good for ; you can refer to existing Haskell tutorials for that , and maybe I 'll talk about that here some other time .
At least 15 locations around the United States are competing for the Air Force 's new Cyber Command , the 10th major command in Air Force history .

Rob Beschizza BARKSDALE AIR FORCE BASE , Louisiana —
When a reporter enters the Air Force office of William Lord , a smile comes quickly to the two - star general 's face as he darts from behind his immaculate desk to shake hands .
Then , as an afterthought , he steps back and shuts his laptop as though holstering a sidearm .
Lord , boyish and enthusiastic , is a new kind of Air Force warrior — the provisional chief of the service 's first new major command since the early 1990s , the Cyber Command .
With thousands of posts and enough bandwidth to choke a horse , the Cyber Command is dedicated to the proposition that the next war will be fought in the electromagnetic spectrum , and that computers are military weapons .
In a windowless building across the base , Lord 's cyber warriors are already perched 24 hours a day before banks of monitors , scanning Air Force networks for signs of hostile incursion .
" We have to change the way we think about warriors of the future , " Lord enthuses , raising his jaw while a B - 52 traces the sky outside his windows .
" So if they can't run three miles with a pack on their backs but they can shut down a SCADA system , we need to have a culture where they fit in . "
Maj. Gen. William Lord is provisional commander of the Air Force 's new Cyber Command .

But before Lord and his geek warriors can settle in for the wars of the future , the general has to survive a battle of a decidedly different nature : a political and cultural tug of war over where the Cyber Command will set up its permanent headquarters .
And that , for Lord and the Air Force , is where things get trickier than a Chinese Trojan horse .
With billions of dollars in contracts and millions in local spending on the line , 15 military towns from Hampton , Virginia , to Yuba City , California , are vying to win the Cyber Command , throwing in offers of land , academic and research tie-ins , and , in one case , an $ 11 million building with a moat .
At a time when Cold War -era commands laden with aging aircraft are shriveling , the nascent Cyber Command is universally seen as a future - proof bet for expansion , in an era etched with portents of cyberwar .
Russian Hackers and Chinese Cyberspies
The news is everywhere .
When Russian hackers were blamed for a wave of denial - of - service attacks against Estonian websites last spring , President Bush voiced concern that the United States would face the same risk .
The national intelligence director , Michael McConnell , recently claimed a computer attack against a single U.S. bank could cause more economic harm than 9/11 , and called for more National Security Agency surveillance of the internet .
A CIA official followed up with a tale about cyber attackers causing multi-city power failures overseas .
Some in the military believe Chinese cyberspies have already penetrated unclassified Pentagon computers .
Where buzz flows , money follows , and the investment in info - war comes as the Air Force cuts back personnel elsewhere to fund new aircraft :
The service just finished phasing out 20,000 enlisted men and women , with plans to dump 20,000 more by 2011 .
The effect of military cutbacks on the surrounding communities can be devastating .
" If you gain or lose a unit in a place where the military is already a major employer , it has a huge impact , " says Chris Erickson , a New Mexico State University professor .
Unofficial estimates say 10,000 military and ancillary jobs could clump around the 500 posts at the Cyber Command 's permanent headquarters .
The governors of California , New Mexico and Louisiana are pitching their locales directly to the secretary of the Air Force .
In December , Louisiana governor Bobby Jindal took advantage of a meeting with President Bush on Katrina recovery to lobby for the Cyber Command .
A dozen congressional delegations have weighed in as well .
Lord is feeling the heat .
" Oh Lord , " the general sighs , " there 's congressional pressure . "
Location , Location , Location " It would sure be nice to have it here , " says Tammy Frank , manager of the Waffle House in Bossier , Louisiana , outside Barksdale 's gates .
She pushes her hair behind her ears and leans on the cash register .
" My ( preteen ) son is into computers , and it will be easier for him to find a good job and stay here . "
The Cyber Command was provisionally established on Barksdale 's 22,000 acres in October , at the edge of a black lake stitched with swamp trees that narrow just above the water line .
The placement was good news for Bossier , which took it as a sign that Louisiana would win the permanent command , too .
A military town for generations , this sprawling suburb - opolis has about 58,000 residents , including 7,000 active - duty and reserve personnel .
Across the Red River in Shreveport , downtown buildings are crumbling and half - abandoned — but Bossier is thriving .
Now realtors are touting proximity to the Cyber Command as a selling point for houses , while local residents hope permanent placement will boost the local economy , and perhaps even infuse the town with high - tech esprit .
The planned Cyber Innovation Center will be designed to withstand a variety of attacks .

To persuade the Air Force of Bossier 's potential as a Deep South Silicon Valley , city officials broke ground last month on a " Cyber Innovation Center , " a $ 100 million office complex abutting Barksdale .
The consortium paid $ 4.7 million for a 64 - acre parcel , and they 've raised $ 50 million from state and local government and another $ 50 million from the federal government for a complex of buildings , starting with an $ 11 million , 120,000 - square - foot cyberfortress .
Renderings show a moat and huge , silvery wedges of metal jutting outward from the building 's base .
There 's a jet in the design , pointed toward the sky .
Built - In Force Protection
" The building has force protection designed into it , " says Craig Spohn , who 's heading the development .
" It can withstand a multitude of attacks . "
Spohn ambles with a limp across a newly cleared patch of an old pecan grove that will house the gleaming redoubt .
The trees remaining on the land are leafless in the bright winter haze , and a B - 52 floats through the sky beyond , headed for the strip at Barksdale .
The sight of the 47 - year old planes coming and going is so common here that only out - of - town visitors and aviation enthusiasts still stare at them .
Spohn follows it with his eyes .
A lanky , gray - haired man in a nice suit , Spohn came back to work directly from arthroscopic knee surgery , and shows off fresh stitches in three holes on his left knee .
He has personal reasons for wanting to win the Cyber Command .
" My dad is retired Air Force , " he says .
" I moved wet and warm to Barksdale , and I love it here .
There were no jobs for me when I left .
And I eventually returned with a job working for SAIC .
" There are a lot of us who want to come back , " he adds .
" Tell the Nation That the Age of Cyberwarfare Is Here " The Cyber Command is rooted in a historic vision statement penned in 2005 by the secretary of the Air Force , Michael Wynne , and co-signed by the Air Force chief of staff .
In the 21st century , Wynne wrote , America 's enemies would contest America in a new range of theaters , and the armed forces must be ready to meet them and , if necessary , " destroy them " there .
Henceforth , he vowed , the Air Force would " fly and fight in air , space and cyberspace . "
" Tell the nation , " Wynne reiterated in a speech last September , " that the age of cyberwarfare is here . "
" Our mission is to control cyberspace both for attacks and defense , " says Lord 's boss , Lt. Gen. Robert Elder — a three - star general who totes a Blackberry and holds a Ph.D. in electrical engineering .
Wearing a green flight suit with no brass , bars or Bronze Star in sight , Elder relaxes in a leather chair away from his desk , and lays out the vision , which amounts to nothing less than a complete transformation of the Air Force .
" We have to learn to plan years out for operations , security defense and integration , to plan how to deter attacks , how to posture to prevent attacks , and we have to stay very current , " Elder says .

The new command , only the 10th in Air Force history , means a single leadership for a number of pieces already in place under different wings .
Cyber warriors are already being trained at Hurlburt Air Force Base in Florida , while Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio holds the defense portion .
Predator reconnaissance UAVs are flown out of Nevada , and Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska has a cluster of information and intelligence wings .
No one knows how many people will ultimately be incorporated into the Cyber Command .
The Air Force 's other nine commands range in size from slightly over 14,000 personnel in the Special Ops Command to 167,000 in the Air Combat Command .
A recent Network World article , quoting Elder , reports the Cyber Command will have 5,000 to 10,000 people .
But the Air Force now disavows that number , confirming only that about 500 airmen and airwomen will be stationed at the Cyber Command headquarters itself .
Unified Command , Single Commander
The important thing , the Air Force says , is that under a unified command , decisions about how to use all the pieces — and control of the budget , more than $ 2 billion the first year — will be in the hands of a single commander instead of being spread out as they are now .
" It makes us nimble , " says Elder .
" It means we can react quickly to change . "
But , he cautions , there 's no plan to consolidate all those pieces in one location .
Such a move would run counter to Air Force policies of decentralized commands .
The Air Force 's new Cyber Command already has an official seal .

Not everyone is enthusiastic about the reorganization .
Defense expert John Pike , director of GlobalSecurity.org , says the Cyber Command 's mission is murky .
" There 's been so much gee - whiz flackery to this , " Pike says .
" They 've got the whole thing tarted up , and it 's hard to tell what they 're actually doing . "
Pike says the Cyber Command may be part of a secret Air Force plan to prepare for war against China , already suspected of trying to hack Department of Defense networks .
He says the new command 's defensive mission is muddled and duplicative :
The NSA already defends military networks .
As for civilian infrastructures like the internet and power grid , they 're privately owned , and the Air Force has no jurisdiction over them .
Lord concedes that the Air Force can't do much on its own to protect civilian systems .
" We 're worrying about the ability of someone to interrupt Wall Street and crash the economy , " he says .
" We 're having a hard time getting Wall Street to work with us . "
On the offensive side , though , everything is on the table , from jamming an enemy 's radar to infiltrating its command - and - control networks .
Someday , the Cyber Command may be able to hack an enemy 's security and radar systems , improving the chances of bombs hitting home .
" It 's the entire electromagnetic spectrum , " says Lord .
" Many of the elements that form ( Cyber Command ) come from our communications and intel operations .
The internet is obviously part , but it also includes things like cellphone frequencies , high - power microwaves and directed - energy components .
" What if we could spoof the enemy , to get them to operate on a set of assumptions by altering their data ? "
Lord asks .
" We talk about being able to change the enemy 's behavior without a kinetic application .
Weapons of mass disruption . "
Cold War Sites Compete for the Code War When the Cyber Command was formally announced in September , the competition began immediately .
Rural Yuba City , California — the home of Beale Air Force Base — rounded up 53 signatures from the state 's congressional delegation , including Sen.
Dianne Feinstein , to try to plant the Cyber Command on California 's fertile soil .
In a newspaper interview , community leader Ron Bartoli touted Yuba 's access to Silicon Valley , which lies about 170 miles away , and argued that cyberwarfare is consistent with Golden State values .
" It 's computers , it 's green , it 's everything California says they want . "
The Cheyenne Mountain complex in Colorado Springs , Colorado — once the home of NORAD — is now a candidate to house the headquarters of Cyber Command .
Courtesy : U.S. Air Force Eight hundred miles away in San Antonio , U.S. Rep. Ciro Rodriguez ( D - Texas ) was explaining the high - tech acumen of his community .
" The robust cyber - security research community in San Antonio has transformed the Alamo City into a national leader on the subject , " he said in a statement .
In the Rockies , Colorado Springs came late to the party , but offered the coolest location : inside Cheyenne Mountain , which once served as headquarters of the North American Aerospace Defense Command ( NORAD ) , but is now used mostly for training .
In the heartland , architecture students at the University of Nebraska - Lincoln held an exhibition to come up with potential building designs for the Cyber Command , producing 13 detailed drawings resembling bunkers , platforms and a burnished black wedge .
" I believe the … proposals may play a provocative role in the future planning of such a free - standing facility , " architecture professor Chris Ford said in a press release .
Nebraska has long held a unique post in America 's defensive footing , and it 's mounting a particularly hungry bid for the Cyber Command .
In 1948 , Offutt Air Force Base was selected for the headquarters of the Strategic Air Command , the linchpin of America 's nuclear strategy .
Square in the middle of the North American continent , the site was out of reach of existing bombers and missiles .
Architecture students at the University of Nebraska - Lincoln produced 13 concepts for the Cyber Command headquarters .
This one is by Burt Jamison .

Now called the U.S. Strategic Command , the drab , concrete headquarters building still anchors Offutt to the nuclear era , with three above - ground floors and four more underground housing a 14,000 - square - foot command center that directs all U.S. nuclear forces .
It 's designed with its own power generator and food supply , so it can be sealed off in the event of a nuclear attack .
Comparisons between nuclear and cyberweapons might seem strained , but there 's at least one commonality .
Scholars exploring the ethics of wielding logic bombs , Trojan horses , worms and bots in wartime often find themselves treading on ground tilled by an earlier generation of Cold War nuclear gamesmen .
" There are lots of unknowns with a cyberattack , " says Neil Rowe , a professor at the Center for Information Security Research at the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School , who rejects cyberattacks as a legitimate tool of war .
" The potential for collateral damage is worse than nuclear technology … .
With cyber , it can spread through the civilian infrastructure and affect far more civilians . "
No Geographic Edge
But ethical concerns are n't weighing down the rainmakers wooing the Cyber Command ; they 're more concerned with local families and future investment .
And without the geographic edge that landed the Strategic Air Command in their backyard a half - century ago , community leaders in Omaha and nearby Bellevue are finding new ways to tempt the decision makers in Washington .
" We 've offered a package that includes land , facilities , and a demographic of strong academics and industrial consortium , " says Megan Lucas , president of the Bellevue Chamber of Commerce .
" We have the infrastructure , dual power grids and dark fiber . "
Lucas is a key organizer in the region 's yearlong campaign to land the Cyber Command at Offutt .
Smart and straightforward , Lucas is so well - known among Offutt staff that they keep track of her schedule , and when the previous base commander , then - Brig .
Gen. T. C. Jones , left Offutt , he designated her his honorary wingman .
A photo of Lucas in her black - leather bomber jacket hangs outside the headquarters office .
Lucas and other local leaders persuaded the Omaha Development Foundation to put together a purchase of 136 acres of snow - crunched land immediately south of the base for expansion .
Bellevue 's entire economic engine and its community are wrapped around Offutt , she says .
Nearly half the people in the town of 49,000 are active - duty or retired military .
Talk of the Cyber Command has gotten around in Bellevue .
In the lounge at the Leopard Lanes bowling alley , a Desert Storm veteran named Jim Chappell runs the karaoke machine on weekends .
He says he 's heard about the competition .
" Maybe Offutt will get it , they 're wired for it , " he says , lighting a cigarette with his father 's Zippo .
" That 's how dealing with the government is .
You have to spend money to attract it .
But there 's plenty of money and work here either way .
" It 's all political , where they decide to put it , " says Lucas .
" We 're clearly the best situated and equipped .
But that does n't mean we 'll get it . "
Stanford law professor Larry Lessig plans to use collaborative software to change Congress .
Courtesy Larry LessigA prominent Stanford law professor on Thursday launched an ambitious project that aims to use collaborative software to harness the extraordinary levels of pent - up political energy and dissatisfaction that voters have shown over the past two years with their members of congress .
The Change Congress project 's first mission is to diminish the influence of money in the legislative body by influencing the outcome of the 2008 election campaigns of 67 members of congress which are up for grabs .
As the Change Congress project founder Larry Lessig noted in the project 's launch Thursday afternoon , there have n't been so many seats open up for challenge in more than a decade .
Lessig , known for his decade - long role in trying to loosen the entertainment industry 's vise - like grip on popular culture by shaping copyright law , is betting that the energy and dissatisfaction exhibited by voters against the status - quo in Washington DC , and the emergence of collaborative software that enables vast numbers of geographically - dispersed citizens to become politically active on their own schedule , will enable a new kind of transparency and accountability in political campaigns .
" The problem we face is ... the problem of crony capitalism using money to capture government , " he said on Monday during the launch of his project in Washington , DC .
" The challenge is whether in fact we can change this .
The political experts tell you that it can't be done , that process always win over substance . "
Lessig and Joe Trippi hope that their project will bring the beginnings of this change by getting voters to challenge their members of congress to commit to Change Congress ' four pledges .
The project will rely on engaged voters to record and map both the responses by , and the positions of candidates who are running for open seats .
The idea is to make what seems like an abstract idea visually tangible through a Google mash - up .
The professor wants legislators to promise to do four things which he says will reduce the influence of money on policymaking :
To promise not to accept money from lobbyists and political action committees ; support public financing of elections ; commit to passing legislation to permanently ban the funneling of money to their districts ' projects of questionable worth ; and to commit to " compel transparency in the functioning of congress . "
Candidates can signal their intentions to take any one or all of the pledges by filling out a form at the organization 's web site , which then formulates code that provides a graphic that the candidates can then place on their election campaign web sites .
The Change Congress project hopes that citizens will track congressional candidates ' positions on these issues by reporting on them at the web site .
The project will then map these results onto a
Google map .
Writing in The Huffington Post this morning , Lessig explained :
... once this wiki-army has tracked the positions of all Members of Congress , we will display a map of reform , circa 2008 : Each Congressional district will be colored in either ( 1 ) dark red , or dark blue , reflecting Republicans or Democrats who have taken a pledge , ( 2 ) light red or light blue , tracking
Republicans and Democrats who have not taken our pledge , but who have signaled support for planks in the Change - Congress platform , or ( 3 ) for those not taking the pledge and not signaling support for a platform of reform , varying shades of sludge , representing the percentage of the
Member 's campaign contributions that come from PACs or lobbyists .
...
What this map will reveal , we believe , is something that not many now actually realize :
That the support for fundamental reform is broad and deep .
That recognition in turn will encourage more to see both the need for reform and the opportunity that this election gives us to achieve it .
Apathy is driven by the feeling that nothing can be done .
This Change Congress map will demonstrate that in fact , something substantial can be done .
Now .
Lessig says that the project will , down the road , model itself on Emily 's List in that it will recruit contributors to finance candidates who make reforming congress a central part of their campaign .
When the Democrats re-took congress in 2006 , they won on a platform built by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi 's mantra of being against the Republicans ' culture of corruption .
Yet the Democratic - led congress ' current job approval rating is in the low twenties .
This apparent dissatisfaction suggests that a large body of people might be ready and interested in volunteering for the Change Congress project .
So far , senator Barack Obama 's campaign for the Democratic nomination for president has surged on this theme of bringing change to Washington , DC .
The Illinois senator 's seemingly magical combination of inspirational rhetoric , off - line community - organization strategies , combined with the smart design of online social networking tools have fostered high levels of engagement .
The question facing the Change Congress campaign is whether Lessig and his colleagues at the Sunlight Foundation can motivate a bi-partisan electorate to become similarly engaged without – at first at least – the funds and advertising budget that 's powering the Obama campaign .
In an interview , Lessig says that for now , he 's going to focus on motivating people to volunteer their time to research members of congress ' positions on transparency , accountability and public financing of campaigns .
" If you give them a big vision , and talk about all the good things that will come out of it , then I think a lot of people will be willing to do the wiki work [ at home ] in their pajamas , " he says .
" The hard thing is getting them to go to rallies and getting them to call their congressman . "
Lessig says that his goal is to raise $ 500,000 to fund the project for the year by May 1 .
He hopes to hire a couple of staffers in the San Francisco bay area and an executive director .
The project has bipartisan appeal – Republicans took over congress in 1994 with similar promises of sweeping change .
As National Journal has thoroughly documented , many of those promises were not fulfilled .
This time , it could be different – now that an engaged electorate has software and an open reporting system to hold their members ' feet to the fire .
Update :
In answer to the reader below 's question on what happens if a member of congress takes a pledge and does n't follow through , Lessig says that he anticipates that each district will have voters who will monitor their members ' activities and report on them .
" If you violate the pledge , you 've created a huge opportunity for people to attack you , " he says .
Update : The Sunlight Foundation has posted footage of the lecture up on Google Video :

When will we listen to the troops ?
I ’m not talking about soldiers used as props for a George Bush photo op , telling reporters what Washington wants to hear .
The military is disciplined and thus accustomed , from Gen. David Petraeus on down , to toeing the official line .
But the Iraq war has also produced brilliant messages of dissent from the ranks that should cause us to stop in our tracks and reconsider what we have wrought .
First , a group of sergeants came forward , and on Tuesday it was the captains ’ turn to speak out .
In “ The War as We Saw It , ” an eloquent Op - Ed article published in The New York Times in August , seven sergeants summarized the futility of their 15 months of fighting in Iraq : “ To believe that Americans , with an occupying force that long ago outlived its reluctant welcome , can win over a recalcitrant local population and win this counterinsurgency is farfetched . ”
After penning that crie de cour , two of the soldiers died in Iraq and a third was severely wounded .
On Tuesday , The Washington Post printed “ The Real Iraq We Knew , ” by 12 former Army captains , all of whom served in Iraq .
It begins : “ Today marks five years since the authorization of military force in Iraq , setting Operation Iraqi Freedom in motion .
Five years on , the Iraq war is as undermanned and under - resourced as it was from the start .
And , five years on Iraq is in shambles .
As Army captains who served in Baghdad and beyond , we ’ve seen the corruption and the sectarian division .
We understand what it ’s like to be stretched too thin .
And we know when it ’s time to get out . ”
How come those brave veterans know it ’s time to get out , but leading Democrats , who voted for the war to be authorized , are still pussyfooting about quickly removing the troops from this ever - deepening quagmire ?
They ’re jockeying for political advantage , knowing that drawing out the war hurts the Republicans .
It is a deeply cynical ploy that works only because with our all - volunteer military , most Americans do n’t have to face the choice of sacrificing themselves or their loved ones in a futile and losing war .
Yes , it costs the taxpayers , but so do the “ Halo 3 ” video games they are purchasing in record numbers , and for most Americans , Iraq is a make - believe war .
Even the cost seems unreal , as Bush is the first president in U.S. history to cut taxes in a time of war , with the result that more than a trillion dollars in long - term obligations will not come due while his administration has to foot the bills .
If there was a draft , people would be in the streets demanding an end to this carnage , which now threatens to go on for decades .
That is precisely what the neocon ideologues who got us into this mess built their fantasies on : a volunteer force , supplemented by hundreds of thousands of contractors ( including 50,000 mercenary troops like those from Blackwater ) and the purchase of largely irrelevant but highly profitable high - tech weaponry , although they forgot about simple armor for the troops .
The most fraudulent neocon claim was that pro-Western , even pro-Israel Iraqis , like their favorite , the now totally discredited Ahmed Chalabi , would police the country as surrogates for the U.S. , and that Iraqi oil sales would pay for it all .
The 12 captains , who worked with the locals , are very clear as to the forlorn outcome of that plan : ” … many of us witnessed the exploitation of U.S. tax dollars by Iraqi officials and military officers .
Sabotage and graft have had a particularly deleterious impact on Iraq ’s oil industry which still fails to produce the revenue that Pentagon war planners hoped would pay for Iraq ’s reconstruction . ”
As for that other ongoing illusion — that we are turning power over to Iraqi forces we have trained — the captains write : “ Iraqi soldiers quit at will .
The police are effectively controlled by militias .
And … corruption is debilitating .
U.S. tax dollars enrich self - serving generals and support the very elements that will battle each other after we ’re gone . ”
Building an empire on the cheap and by proxy does n’t work .
If you want one , and of course most of us do n’t , since only a few fat cats benefit from such imperial adventures , you need a vast conscript army .
As the captains put it : “ There is only one way we might be able to succeed in Iraq .
To continue an operation of this intensity and duration , we would have to abandon our volunteer military for compulsory service .
Short of that , our best option is to leave Iraq immediately . ”
Enough said .

A £ 125,000 campaign to replace Scotland 's Best Small Country In The World tag has been unveiled .
And the exciting new catchphrase dreamed up by top advertising brains is ... " Welcome to Scotland " .
Artwork featuring the message will be displayed at all Scots airports from St Andrew 's Day , accompanied by different national and local messages .
The decision to rebrand Scotland 's " points of entry " follows a pledge by First Minister Alex Salmond to scrap his predecessor Jack McConnell 's slogan " Scotland , the Best Small Country in the World " .
Salmond said that was too downbeat and typified the " Scottish cringe " .
The new message was devised with help from one of Scotland 's top advertising agencies , The Leith Agency .
Extra national slogans include " World Leader in Learning " and " First to Introduce Universal Education " as well as " Home of Golf " and the snappy : " Home of Europe 's Fastest Growing Life Sciences Community " .
Glasgow 's sign will also say " Birthplace of Charles Rennie Mackintosh " and refer to the 2014 Commonwealth Games among other slogans .
Edinburgh 's options include " UNESCO First City of Literature " and " Real Financial Strength " .
Visitors to Inverness could be greeted with " Home to Mountain Bike World Cup , " while passengers at Prestwick will read " Home of Robert Burns " .
Aberdeen signs could say " Energy Capital of Europe " and Dundee will use the " City of Discovery " tag .
The new artwork was unveiled at Glasgow airport yesterday by culture minister Linda Fabiani .
She said : " These images will welcome people arriving in our country and Scots coming home , giving everyone a taste and glimpse of the very best of Scotland .
" This is not about developing flashy slogans .
" This is about showing what a modern , vibrant and successful country Scotland is . "
But Labour MSP Jackie Baillie said : " If ' Welcome to Scotland ' is the best Alex Salmond 's government can come up with , it shows the SNP have had an imagination bypass .
It sounds more like a road sign at Berwick than it does a must - do invitation to visit our country . "
However , tourism and business leaders backed the change .
VisitScotland chief executive Philip Riddle said the displays would help establish Scotland as a " must - visit , must - return destination " .
The Labour leader of Glasgow City Council , Steven Purcell , said : " We are delighted to see key messages about Glasgow , including our Commonwealth Games win , and striking city imagery in the new point of entry materials . "
A government spokesman said the £ 125,000 cost of the displays covered the new artwork , printing and installation .
The cash came from existing budgets as the Best Small Country campaign was due to come to an end .
REBRANDING : WHAT'S IN A NAME CHANGE ?
OTHER rebrandings include :
Prestwick airport got the slogan " Pure Dead Briliant " as part of a £ 3 million upgrade last year .
But a logo featuring a cartoon drunken Scotsman sparked outrage .
First Minister Alex Salmond renamed the Scottish Executive the Scottish government .
It cost £ 100,000 to change stationery and signs .
But Westminster still refer to the " Executive " - the legal name .
The Scottish Office were renamed the Scotland Office after devolution in 1999 .
The Scottish Tourist Board became VisitScotland in 2001 .
It took five years for the change to be made legal .
Mars changed their Marathon bars into Snickers and Opal Fruits to Starburst .

Suicide bombings in Iraq are averaging roughly 42 a month , American military officials said .
[ In April , a pair of truck bombers killed nine American soldiers , another bomber blew himself up in the Green Zone killing one member of Parliament , and others killed more than 290 civilians . ]
Rising Anger at Shiites
The anger among militants in Zarqa , a mostly Sunni city , is now directed at Shiites as much as Americans , reflecting the escalation in hostility between the two branches of Islam since Shiites gained dominance in the new Iraqi government .
“ They have traditions that are un-Islamic and they hate the Sunnis , ” said Ahmad Khalil Abdelaziz Salah , an imam whose mosque in Zarqa was attended by some of Zarqa ’s bombers .
Asked to name his targets , Abu Ibrahim said : “ First , the Shiites .
Second , the Americans .
Third , anywhere in the world where Islam is threatened . ”
Among a small circle of young Islamists and relatives here , the fates of the six young men are well known .
Three of the men are said to have died : two as suicide bombers and one apparently by gunfire .
One has been held in Iraq and the other two , including Abu Ibrahim , were turned back .
Abu Ibrahim , who spoke on the condition that his name and some personal details be withheld , told his story in interviews over five hours .
To back up his account , he agreed to show reporters his passport , which confirmed he entered Syria last fall .
Relatives of another one of the young men quoted from a letter he had written saying goodbye and indicating he was going to Iraq .
The family of a third man , who was captured and is being detained by American troops , provided a copy of his detention records from the International Committee of the Red Cross .
The six men left Zarqa last fall , all apparently with the same goal , but driven by their own individual circumstances .
The youngest , 19 - year - old Amer Jaradad , left without telling his family where he was going .
But they were not surprised .
Introduction
Battleships Forever is a freeware tactical Real Time Strategy game that put 's you in command of a small fleet of warships in space .
Combat and damage mechanics are extremely detailed .
Everything is simulated in game if possible .
There are no abitrary " to hit chance " values in Battleships Forever .
The game also features many innovative mechanics that you 've never seen before .
For example , the Cronus Battleship sports a Flux Shield generator that allows you to draw a defensive force shield around your ships in any shape you want .
Another example are the Deflector modules that are used extensively through the game .
These modules make a single section of a ship totally invulnerable to fire .
This means that you will have to manoeuvre your ships to attack sections of the enemy ships not protected by Deflectors while keeping your own protected sections facing the enemy .
Position is paramount !
Players will command picked fleets made up of Battleships , Destroyers and Patrol Craft .
The completed game will include ten campaign missions and multiple skirmish modes .
Battleships Forever is inspired by and loosely based on Warning Forever by Hikoza .

About The Ships
Each warship is modeled to meticulous detail .
Your ships can be controlled to drift in one direction while facing another direction for strafing attacks .
Each section of your ship is an object on it's own .
If a section is destroyed , any child sections that were connected to the core of your ship through that section will also be destroyed .
This section - based modular ship system makes positioning very important .
Take the Hestia - Class Assault Destroyer for example ;
It 's sections and weapons are swept forward allowing it to concentrate it 's fire to the front .
At the same time , the Hestia is vulnerable to rear attacks which can destroy it 's wing 's connection strut , thus destroying the entire wing in one blow .
There are 17 playable ships available : Cronus Battleship
Peitho Armoured Battlecruiser
Hecate Dreadnought Athena Advanced Dreadnought
Arcas Carrier
Hestia Assault Destroyer Hestia Alpha
Enyo Cruiser
Oenone Beam Destroyer Oenone Delta
Helios PointDefence Destroyer
Tmolus Bombardier
Moira Torpedo Destroyer Moira X
Proteus Gunship
Zelus Attack Boat
Thetis Drone Carrier
In the campaign and skirmish modes , you will face more than fifty types of enemy craft !
About The Weapons
Each turret is individually articulated and has its own firing arc , range , turning speed and health .
Turrets can be individually destroyed in order to de - tooth an enemy .
Beams will even rake across the enemy ship 's hull , tracing out a trail of destruction .
Individual turrets can even be targeted and sniped off .
Active defences are also a major part of your tactics in Battleships Forever .
Many ships are equipped with interceptor turrets that shoot down incoming projectiles .
Maximizing your interceptor coverage to nullify enemy firepower is the key the victory .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Al Qaeda is training fighters that “ look western ” and could easily cross U.S. borders without attracting attention , CIA Director Michael Hayden said on Sunday .

Al Qaeda is training fighters that " look western " and could easily cross U.S. borders without attracting attention , Hayden said on Sunday .

The militant Islamist group has turned Pakistan ’s remote tribal areas along the border with Afghanistan into a safe haven , and is using it to plot further attacks against the United States , Hayden said .
“ They are bringing operatives into that region for training -- operatives that would n’t attract your attention if they were going through the customs line at Dulles ( airport outside Washington ) with you when you were coming back from overseas , ” Hayden said during an interview on NBC ’s television show Meet the Press .
“ ( They ) look western ( and ) would be able to come into this country without attracting the kinds of attention that others might , ” Hayden said , without offering further details .
The United States went to war in Afghanistan after the September 11 attacks on U.S. cities in order to crush al Qaeda and hunt down its chief , Osama bin Laden , who Hayden confirmed was still believed by the United States to be hiding in the rugged Afghan border area .
The Washington Post reported on Thursday that the United States had stepped up unilateral attacks on al Qaeda targets in Pakistan because it fears the country ’s newly elected leaders will soon curb U.S. actions on their soil .
Pakistan ’s pro-U.S. president , Pervez Musharraf , has been weakened by the defeat of his allies in the country ’s recent elections .
Hayden declined to comment directly on the Post article , but he stressed that the tribal regions were very sensitive .
“ The situation along that Afghanistan / Pakistan border presents a clear and present danger to Afghanistan , to Pakistan , to the West in general and the United States in particular , ” Hayden said .
“ It is very clear to us that al Qaeda has been able over the last 18 months or so to establish a safe haven along the Afghan / Pakistan border that they have not enjoyed before . ”
Asked directly whether he feared Musharraf might not be around as president for much longer to support the United States , Hayden said he did not know , but praised what the country had already delivered .
“ We have not had a better partner in the war against terrorism than the Pakistani government , ” he said .

When I first heard the news yesterday , that Sheridan College had been locked down because of a gunman , I felt chills run up my spine .
Someone from my work had just been sent over to the school to talk about sales , and back at my office we were all concerned .
Thankfully it was reported later in the day that there was no attack .
Today , however , it 's been revealed that the gun sighting that caused a professor to call in the emergency and the subsequent police lockdown was actually ... a camera tripod sighting .
The emergency response came about when a professor and eight students reported seeing a suspicious man in camouflage carrying around a " long , tubular object " .
The police came in and forced students to stay in their classes and dorm rooms until around 4:30 pm .
Ambulances and emergency vehicles were called in and at the ready , but no gun shots were heard , and no one was hurt .
An exhaustive two hour search of the area resulted in the uncovering of no gunman , and no threat .
And today we 've learned that this was all triggered by a tripodman , not a gunman .
This got me thinking .
Is this level of reaction warranted ?
Do we need to be so cautious / suspicious / paranoid as to call in the police when a student is seen with a " long , tubular object " , that could be a gun , or a tripod , or a document tube , or anything else roughly the same shape and size of a gun ( which comes in many different shapes and sizes ) ?
The fear and quick reaction may have stemmed from the recollection of actual incidents .
Attacks that have gone on in other schools and reported by the media ( most recently the stabbings at Humberside Collegiate , and on a larger scale , the shootings at Dawson College in Montreal a year and a half ago ) may still be fresh on our minds .
It also does n't help that we 've experienced the foolish antics of a hoax bomber .
But I have to wonder if we 're scaring ourselves silly .
At what point does reactionary panic surpass common sense ?
Sheridan College is known internationally for its animation program , and there are most likely hundreds of students at that school carrying around tripods .
Was it the camouflage attire of the tripodman that caused the professor 's mind ( and the minds of eight other students , we can't forget ) to turn directly to the worst case scenario ?
Clearly , hasty reactions to non-treats sometimes lead to lots of lost time and money , but how could this incident have been handled differently ?
Should the professor have pursued the tripodman to get a better look at the tripod before calling it a gun ?
Although this was another false alarm , I do applaud the school 's security and Halton Region police for responding so quickly .
It 's nice to know that when a threat is perceived , especially in this age of easily acquired firearms and increasingly dangerous schools , response is timely and effective .
Police are still looking for the man that caused the lockdown , and if anyone has any info , they 'd like you to call it in to Crime Stoppers .
The man is white , around six - feet tall with a medium build , has brown hair with a prominent bald spot and long sideburns .
He was last seen wearing blue jeans , a lumber style jacket that was possibly green and thin glasses .
Oh , and he may be a videographer or photographer , so watch out .
He might take your picture .
It 's not yet clear exactly what kind of tripod was carrying .
I wonder what would have happened had he been carrying around one of these !

S.F. restricts China protests for torch relay SAN FRANCISCO
San Francisco is planning to restrict protesters of the Chinese government to specific areas of the city when the Beijing Olympics torch makes its only North American stop here next month .
Organizations that oppose China 's human - rights record said Tuesday that they 've been denied demonstration permits at large outdoor gathering areas on April 9 , the day of the torch relay .
They will instead be forced into certain areas , possibly far from the main torch route .
City officials said that the restrictions are necessary to ensure security at the event but that those precautions should n't limit the protesters ' rights to gather , a right guaranteed in the First Amendment .
Tens of thousands of protesters are expected , organizers said .
The event will be open to everyone , said Mayor Gavin Newsom , including " those who want to see this as an opportunity to raise the flag of concern about issues of disagreement with the Chinese government .
That is something that is sacrosanct to us . "
But that opportunity will be limited in ways uncommon for the city that hosts myriad rallies and protests .
Protesters will be restricted to " areas set up for First Amendment rights issues , " according to Sgt. Neville Gittens , spokesman for the San Francisco Police Department .
When asked if the areas would be along the route , Gittens replied , " They will be in areas associated with the route . "
He said the city was " working with the ( Beijing Olympic ) committee to address the concerns they might have in regards to any protests . "
He would not elaborate on those concerns .
Nor would Gittens say what the torch route would be , only that the Beijing Olympic committee is working with police and other city officials .
He said the route would be announced at the latest possible date .
Newsom , however , said emphatically and repeatedly that the committee would by itself decide the torch route through the city .
Newsom also said he would not " politicize the Olympics " - but he may be asked to do so .
Supervisor Chris Daly on Tuesday introduced a resolution that urges the city official who receives the torch for the city - quite possibly the mayor - to state publicly that the torch is " received with alarm and protest at the failure of China to meet its past solemn promises to the international community , including the citizens of San Francisco , to cease the egregious and ongoing human rights abuses in China and occupied Tibet . "
Supervisors will vote on that resolution in the coming weeks .
The restrictions on protest locations are " a de facto limitation on the First Amendment rights of protesters , " said Libby Marsh , director of the Northern California area for Human Rights Watch , an international organization .
She said she believes the city is " under pressure from the Beijing Olympic Committee and the Chinese government " to minimize the protesters ' influence .
Several groups are planning to hold protest events in the days before the April 9 torch relay .
Critics of the Chinese government 's policies toward Tibet , Taiwan , the Falun Gong spiritual movement , Burma and Sudan 's Darfur region are trying to organize a rally on that day .
They have been denied permits to use Civic Center Plaza and have been told that all other large gathering spots in the city are on hold in case they are used as part of the Olympic festivities .
" San Francisco is the only one stop in North America and I know the Chinese government is going to broadcast that to mainland China to show what kind of support they have , " said Huy Lu , a Chinese immigrant who came to the United States via Vietnam 20 years ago .
Lu is helping to organize Bay Area events for the Human Rights Torch , an alternative torch that is also traveling the world and will arrive in San Francisco on April 5 .
Organizers are planning a rally and a march to the Chinese Consulate in the city .
" We want people to see something different , the two faces of the Chinese government , " Lu said .
Another group is organizing the Tibetan Freedom Torch Relay , which is also traveling around the world and will stop in San Francisco 's United Nations Plaza on April 8 .
The headscarf issue provokes strong reactions on both sides
The issue is deeply divisive in Turkey , where the state is strictly secular , and protests are expected .
The government said the ban meant many girls were being denied an education .
But the secular establishment , including generals and academics , see this as a first step to allowing Islam to figure more largely in public life .
Burka ban
Parliament voted 403-107 in favour of a first amendment , which will insert a paragraph into the constitution stating that everyone has the right to equal treatment from state institutions , Parliament Speaker Koksal Toptan was quoted by AP as saying .
MPs then backed by 403-108 votes a second amendment stating " no - one can be deprived of [ his or her ] right to higher education " , AP said .
We say it will damage secularity ...
Once you do that - we believe you damage democracy

A strict headscarf ban had been in force in Turkish universities since 1997 .
The ban came after the staunchly secularist military had exerted pressure to oust a government it saw as too Islamist .
The changes state that only traditional scarves will be permitted in universities , tied loosely under the chin .
Headscarves that cover the neck are still banned , as is the chador and the all - enveloping burka .
Ural Akbulut , rector of the Middle East Technical University , in Ankara , says the changes represent the imposition of religious beliefs into the constitution .
" We say it will damage secularity , " he told the BBC .
" Once you do that - we believe you damage democracy . "
Missing out
The BBC's Sarah Rainsford says those who wear the headscarf dismiss that as paranoia .

As Turkey 's population is predominantly Muslim , two - thirds of all Turkish women cover their heads , meaning thousands have been missing out on the opportunity to attend college .
Many
Turks argue that is unfair and there has been widespread public support for the move .
But tens of thousands of people who were against lifting the ban are expected to join protest rallies in the capital on Saturday .
CALEXICO , Calif . ( AP ) 
A magnitude - 4.9 earthquake rocked the northern Baja California region of Mexico near the U.S. border on Monday , just days after the region was hit by a magnitude - 5.4 temblor , authorities said .
Monday 's quake , which occurred around 10:30 a.m. PT , was centered about 20 miles southeast of the border town of Mexicali at a depth of nearly 4 miles , according to the U.S. Geological Survey .
The epicenter was 23 miles south - southeast of the U.S. city of Calexico .
The magnitude was revised down from an initial magnitude of 5.1 .
There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries on the U.S. side , according to the Imperial County Sheriff 's Department and Calexico police .
The quake was felt in California in parts of San Diego , Imperial and Orange counties and as far away as Yuma , Ariz . , about 50 miles from Calexico , according to the USGS .
Early Saturday , the Mexicali area was shaken by a magnitude - 5.4 quake that shut down factories and knocked out electricity for 400,000 people .
The latest temblor was likely an aftershock of the magnitude - 5.4 event last week , said Julie Martinez , a geophysicist at the National Earthquake Information Center in Golden , Colo .
A swarm of smaller quakes , ranging from magnitudes 2.5 to 2.9 , preceded Monday 's temblor .
At least five aftershocks were recorded including one registering a magnitude - 3.6 , the USGS said .

wikinear.com , OAuth and Fire Eagle
I ’m pleased to announce wikinear.com .
It ’s a simple site that does just one thing : show you a list of the five Wikipedia pages that are geographically closest to your current location .
It ’s designed ( or not - designed ) to be used mainly from mobile phones .
You ’ll need a Fire Eagle invitation code to use the site .
I ’ve got four spare ; the first four comments to ask for one can have them my invites are all accounted for .
If you do n’t have a Fire Eagle account you ’ll have to make do with this screenshot instead .
The idea for the site came from living in Oxford for a year .
The city is full of beautiful old historic buildings ( many of them colleges ) , but very few of them are labelled or signposted .
With wikinear.com and a GPS hooked up to Fire Eagle , I can pull out my phone and see a list of the closest points of interest , plotted on a handy map .
Under the hood the site combines a number of interesting technologies : OAuth , Fire Eagle , GeoNames and the new Google Static Maps API .
OAuth
OAuth was originally designed to solve a problem with OpenID : in an authentication protocol based on browser redirects , how do you authenticate a desktop or command - line application ?
As it turned out , the solution to that problem solved a bunch of other problems that are unrelated to OpenID , so OAuth now exists as very much its own thing .
In essence , it lets users delegate permission to perform actions on their behalf , without having to hand their regular authentication credentials ( e.g. username and password ) over to a third - party piece of software .
If you ’ve ever used a Flickr application that sends you back to Flickr to ask permission to view your private photos you ’ll understand what OAuth does straight away .
Before OAuth , sites had to invent their own solutions to this problem — complete with smart security measures , their own UI flow and libraries for developers wishing to access their protected APIs .
OAuth provides a ready - made solution , complete with tested libraries in a bunch of languages .
If you want to securely expose your user ’s private data via an API , OAuth is a no-brainer .
I expect to see a lot more of it over the next year .
Fire Eagle
Launched at ETech a few weeks ago , Fire Eagle is a service with enormous potential .
You can watch Tom Coates explain it in ten minutes in this video from the conference , but the short version is that Fire Eagle acts as a location broker .
It consists of two key OAuth - protected APIs : one for setting the geographical location of a user , and another for retrieving that location .
This leads to a neat separation of concerns .
On the one hand are the applications that attempt to figure out your location — GPS receivers , WiFi maps , mobile phones that triangulate nearby cell towers , or even sites that know where you are because you told them ( Dopplr and Upcoming , for example , or the Fire Eagle site itself ) .
On the other hand are the applications that do something useful with your location — from restaurant review sites , traffic alert services , friend finders and ARGs down to trivial applications like wikinear.com .
As a developer , this is really exciting .
I can build location - based services without having to solve the much bigger problem of figuring out where my users are .
Even better , wikinear.com becomes incrementally more useful every time someone builds a new tool for passing location information to Fire Eagle , without me having to do anything at all .
Obviously privacy is a huge concern when dealing with this kind of data .
That ’s where the Fire Eagle application itself comes in : it provides a simple suite of tools for users to manage the applications that can access their location .
Applications can be permitted to access different levels of accuracy or disabled entirely , and there ’s a “ Hide ” button for disabling all applications at once .
Disclaimer : I worked on an early prototype of Fire Eagle as my last project at Yahoo !
before leaving in January 2007 , but the product that has launched has changed enormously and is entirely the work of the current Fire Eagle team .
wikinear.com is inspired by part of that early prototype .
Wikipedia and GeoNames
Wikipedia has a thriving community of geo-hackers , mainly focused around the Maps , Geographical coordinates and Wikipedia - World wiki projects .
Many Wikipedia pages ( Brighton , for example ) have their co-ordinates in the top- right , added using a bewildering array of macros and markup extensions .
You can browse through the huge collection of geotagged pages using this KML - powered Google Maps tool — zoom in and wait a few seconds to load in more markers .
The wonderful GeoNames ( also used on djangopeople .net ) includes an API for querying Wikipedia by location , based on 610,000 articles extracted from a Wikipedia data dump .
This was a huge relief when I found it , as “ order by distance from X ” is actually pretty tricky to do efficiently ; I ’ve used expanding bounding box searches in the past but I ’d love to hear about more effective solutions .
Google Static Maps
A long - term criticism of the Google Maps API is that it requires JavaScript to display anything at all — once you ’ve committed to using it , you ’re going to have trouble implementing unobtrusive scripting ( although you can work around the problem to some extent ) .
Yahoo !
Maps has long been better in this regard , but their map image API is a bit of a pain to use — you have to do an initial call to get back the URL to an image embedded in an XML file , then extract that URL and send it to the browser .
Launched last month , Google ’s Static Maps API is a big improvement .
As with Google Charts , you need only construct a URL to the image to have it dynamically generated on the fly .
You can also specify markers , and optionally omit the initial latitude / longitude / zoom to indicate that you want a best fit for the markers you are displaying .
There ’s even a flag for a “ mobile optimised ” image which I ’m using for wikinear.com .
Mixing it all together
Excluding templates , the entire application comes in at less than 200 lines of code and took around two hours to build .
The only persistence is a couple of cookies for storing Fire Eagle tokens ; Django ’s database layer is n’t even configured ( and user locations are n’t logged anywhere , which is great from a privacy point of view ) .
I suppose it ’s a classic mashup — Fire Eagle + OAuth + Wikipedia + GeoNames + Google Static Maps = wikinear.com .
Despite its simplicity ( or maybe because if it ) , I think it ’s a neat demonstration of the kind of applications Fire Eagle enables .

The Federal Reserve is trying a range of new tricks to push new forms of lending as a means of preventing what they fear may otherwise be a major collapse in financial markets .
What all these strategies have in common is an unwillingness to come to terms with the reality that the crisis is based on real factors and can't be merely papered over without grave consequence to economic health .
Thus , last Tuesday ( March 11 ) , in response to the looming troubles with the Bear Stearns investment bank , the US central bank said that it would offer primary dealers up to $ 200 billion in Treasury securities for 28 days in exchange for triple A rated mortgage backed securities ( MBS ) as collateral .
As the problems with Bear Stearns intensified and clients started to pull out cash the Fed announced that it was ready to do much more .
Last Sunday , March 16 , the Fed announced it would provide direct loans to investment banks through the discount window for the first time since the Great Depression .
The Fed has agreed to lend investment banks against a large variety of paper securities including a big chunk of difficult - to - trade securities .
This move by the Fed came in response to Bear Stearns 's cash holdings dropping from $ 17 billion on March 11 to $ 2 billion on March 14 .
The fact that Bear Stearns was rapidly losing cash posed a serious threat to the repo market .
In this market , banks and securities firms extend and receive short - term loans that are backed by securities .
Fed officials feared that Bear Stearns 's dwindled cash situation posed a risk that it would not be able to honor its indebtedness .
This in turn could undermine the confidence in the large $ 4.5 trillion repo market and further damage the credit market .
In the end , Fed officials orchestrated the selling of the Bear Stearns to JP Morgan Chase Co for $ 2 a share , or $ 236 million .
Note that on December 20 , 2007 , Bear shares closed at $ 91.42 .
The main reason given for this deal was to prevent further uncertainty that was poised to destabilize financial markets .
Most commentators have endlessly praised the innovative methods that Bernanke and his colleagues are introducing to counter the financial crisis .
Bernanke , who has written a lot about the causes of the Great Depression , is regarded as the ultimate expert on how to counter the current economic crisis .
In short , most commentators are of the view that the man knows what he is doing and he will be able to fix the current financial problems .
Bernanke is of the view that by means of aggressive monetary policy the credit markets can be normalized .
Once credit markets are brought back to normalcy , this will play an important role in preventing serious economic crisis .
Remember Bernanke 's financial accelerator model : a minor shock in the financial sector could result in large damage to the real economy .
In short , Bernanke , by means of his so - called " innovative " policy of fixing the symptoms of the disease , believes he can cure the disease .
What is the source of the disease and why are investment banks so heavily infected by it ?
The root of the problem is the Fed 's very loose interest rate policy and strong monetary pumping from January 2001 to June 2004 .
The federal funds rate target was lowered from 6.5 % to 1 % .
It is this that has given rise to various malinvestments , which we label here as bubble activities .
We define a bubble as the outcome of activities that have emerged on the back of loose monetary policy of the central bank .
In the absence of monetary pumping , these activities would not have emerged .
Since bubble activities are not self - funded , their emergence must come at the expense of various self - funded or productive activities .
This means that less real saving is left for real wealth - generators , which in turn undermines real wealth formation .
( Monetary pumping gives rise to misallocation of resources , which as a rule manifests itself through a relative increase in nonproductive activities against productive activities . )
When new money is created out of thin air , its effect is not felt instantaneously across all the market sectors .
The effect moves from one individual to another individual and thus from one market to another market .
Monetary pumping then generates bubble activities across all markets as time goes by .
As with any other business , participants in financial markets like investment banks are trying to " make money . "
It is this that gives rise to the creation of various products like collateralized debt obligations ( CDO ) and mortgage - backed securities ( MBS ) in order to secure as big a slice as possible of the pool of newly created money .
( Financial entrepreneurs are basically trying to exploit opportunities created by the Fed 's loose monetary stance and get as much as possible out of the expanded pool of money . )
As long as the Fed kept pushing money into the system to support the low interest rate target , various activities that sprang up on the back of the loose stance appeared to be for real .
When money is plentiful and interest rates are extremely low , investment in various relatively high - yielding assets like CDO's and MBS 's that masquerade as top - notch grade investment becomes very attractive .
The prompt payment of interest and a very low rate of defaults further reinforce the attractiveness of financially engineered investment products .
However , once the central bank tightens its monetary stance — i.e. , reduces monetary pumping — this undermines various bubble activities .
The damage from the loose monetary policies of the Fed from January 2001 to June 2004 cannot be undone by trying to fix symptoms .
Various activities or financial bubbles that sprang up on the back of loose monetary policies have weakened the bottom line of the economy .
This fact cannot be undone by another dosage of policies that attempt to suppress the symptoms .
If anything , such policies are likely only to weaken the bottom line further .
Remember that nonproductive activities are not self funded .
Their existence is made possible by the diversion of real funding from wealth - generating activities .
The diversion of real funding in turn was made possible by loose monetary policy .
Hence the tightening in monetary stance from June 2004 to September 2007 is what is currently undermining various false activities .
Monetary policy manifests itself through the prices of various goods and assets .
A price of a good is the number of dollars per unit of a good .
When the growth momentum of money supply strengthens , this lifts the number of dollars paid per unit of a good generated by a particular activity — i.e. , prices go up .
Conversely a tighter monetary stance that slows the flow of money puts downward pressure on the prices of assets , or the prices of the goods of various activities .
A tighter monetary stance generates two things .
It weakens the supply of real savings to nonproductive activities and weakens the flow of money to these activities .
( Remember that real savings are diverted to bubble activities from wealth - generating activities by means of loose monetary policy . )
A diminished flow of real savings starts to undermine the existence of false activities and their solvency becomes questionable .
A fall in the flow of money in turn puts downward pressure on the prices of goods of these activities .
In fact , prices of goods that emanate from false activities have a tendency to fall sharply during the economic bust .
This in turn reduces the flow of investors ' money to these activities .
As a result the prices of the stocks of bubble activities also tends to fall sharply , which puts more pressure on these activities .
( With the value of their assets falling , misdirected investments can now only secure less funding from lenders . )
In contrast , wealth - generating activities that do not need an expansion of money for their existence actually start to gain strength .
A fall in the prices of their goods is likely to be less severe than that seen in the prices of the goods of bubble activities .
In fact their prices may not fall at all .
Remember that wealth generators are engaged in the production of goods and services that are on the highest priority list of consumers .
In contrast , bubble investments are engaged in the production of goods and services that are on the low priority list of consumers .
As consumers ' real incomes fall because of the damaging effect from loose monetary policy , goods and services produced by various bubble investments may not feature at all on consumers ' priority list .
We suspect that at the moment a tighter stance from June 2004 to September 2007 is dominating the current economic scene .
So - called economic growth is always assessed in terms of GDP , which is the amount of money spent on final goods and services .
The pace of monetary pumping sets the rate of growth of GDP .
A stronger money rate of growth tends to be followed by a stronger GDP rate of growth , while a weakening in the money rate of growth is followed by a weakening in the growth momentum of GDP .
The engine of economic growth is not money , however , but real savings .
If the pool of real saving is declining or stagnating , then the economy — also in terms of GDP — will follow suit , irrespective of what the Fed is doing .
How a particular sector responds to a tighter monetary stance depends on the extent to which that sector has been infected by bubble investments .
The larger the percentage of bubble activities vis -à - vis all activities in a particular sector , the more severe the effect of a tighter stance .
If the pool of real savings is still expanding , then it means that bubble investments in general do not dominate the economic scene .
( They can still be dominant in a particular sector or sectors . )
This means that commercial bank expansion of credit is not going to collapse and the growth momentum of money is likely to hold its ground .
However , if the pool of real savings is falling or stagnating , this could mean that bubble activities are dominating the scene , which in turn raises the likelihood that the commercial banks ' expansion of credit will come to a halt .
Obviously one can always argue that the Fed could open the money spigots in a big way and flood the economy with money .
There is no doubt that the Fed could do it .
This does not mean , however , that banks will embark on an expansion of credit if the pool of real savings is falling .
Obviously , then , if the pool of real saving is still healthy , Bernanke 's policies might " work . "
In short , after a time lag , financial markets might start zooming ahead and the real economy will follow suit .
We suggest that if this were to happen , the recovery should n't be attributed to Bernanke 's policies but , rather , understood to have happened despite his policies .
In the alternative scenario , to which we assign a fairly high likelihood , the pool of real savings is actually falling or stagnating .
In the framework of the alternative scenario , Bernanke 's policies will only do further damage to the stock of savings and sound capital investment , and plunge the economy into a severe and prolonged crisis .
Definitions
Amplitude
The maximum absolute value that a specific coherent - noise function can output .
In libnoise , a coherent - noise function with an ampltude of n generates values between +n and -n , although in some cases ( for example , when generating Perlin noise ) , this is not guaranteed .
Coherent noise A type of smooth pseudorandom noise .
Coherent noise is generated by a coherent - noise function , which has three important properties :
Passing in the same input value will always return the same output value .
A small change in the input value will produce a small change in the output value .
A large change in the input value will produce a random change in the output value .
An n-dimensional coherent - noise function requires an n-dimensional input value .
Its output value is always a scalar .
In libnoise , all coherent - noise functions are three - dimensional .
Three - dimensional coherent noise is often called solid noise because it can be used to create solid three - dimensional textures .
The following graph shows the output of a one - dimensional coherent - noise function n(x ) with a frequency of 2 : Compare it to the following graph that shows the output of a non-coherent - noise function n( x ) :
Combiner module A noise module that mathematically combines the output values from two or more source modules together .
Examples of combiner modules include : noise :: module :: Add —
Adds the two output values from two source modules .
— Adds the two output values from two source modules .
noise :: module :: Max —
Outputs the larger of the two output values from two source modules .
The following image demonstrates the noise : : module : : Add noise module , a type of combiner module .
Control module
A noise module that indicates how to combine the output values from the source modules that are connected to a selector module .
Frequency
The number of cycles per unit length that a specific coherent - noise function outputs .
Coherent noise has properties similar to that of a sine wave :
It has periodic cycles of length 1 / f , where f is its frequency .
, where is its frequency .
At the start of each cycle , it outputs a value of zero .
Unlike a sine wave , the output of a coherent - noise function may or may not cross zero during the middle of a cycle .
The following graph shows the output of a one - dimensional coherent - noise function n(x ) :
In the above graph , the beginning of each cycle is shown with a circle .
The following graphs show the outputs of one - dimensional coherent - noise functions n( x ) with frequencies 2 , 4 , and 8 .
In these graphs , f refers to frequency .
Generator module A noise module that outputs a value generated by a coherent - noise function or some other mathematical function .
If a generator module outputs coherent noise , the output of this module is often called solid noise .
This is because solid noise can be used to create solid three - dimensional textures .
Examples of generator modules include : noise :: module :: Const —
Outputs a constant value .
— Outputs a constant value .
noise :: module :: Perlin —
Outputs a value generated by a Perlin - noise function .
— Outputs a value generated by a Perlin - noise function .
noise :: module:: Voronoi —
Outputs a value generated by a Voronoi - cell function .
The following image demonstrates the noise : : module : : Perlin noise module , a type of generator module .
Lacunarity
A multiplier that determines how quickly the frequency increases for each successive octave in a Perlin - noise function .
The frequency of each successive octave is equal to the product of the previous octave 's frequency and the lacunarity value .
A similar property to lacunarity is persistence , which modifies the octaves ' amplitudes in a similar way .
Modifier module A noise module that mathematically modifies the output value from a source module .
Examples of modifier modules include : noise :: module :: Curve —
Maps the output value from the source module onto an arbitrary function curve .
— Maps the output value from the source module onto an arbitrary function curve .
noise :: module :: Invert —
Inverts the output value from the source module .
The following image demonstrates the noise : : module : : Invert noise module , a type of modifier module .
Noise Module
In libnoise , an object that calculates and outputs a value given a three - dimensional input value .
All noise modules are instantiations of classes derived from the base class noise :: module : : Module .
Each noise module class uses a specific method to calculate an output value .
Some of these methods include : Calculating a value using a coherent - noise function or some other mathematical function .
Changing the output value from another noise module in various ways .
Combining the output values from two noise modules in various ways .
Noise modules can be chained together in near - infinite ways like LEGO ® bricks .
libnoise has several types of noise modules : Combiner module
Generator module
Modifier module
Selector module
Transformer module

Octave
One of the coherent - noise functions in a series of coherent - noise functions that are added together to form Perlin noise .
These coherent - noise functions are called octaves because each octave has , by default , double the frequency of the previous octave .
Musical tones have this property as well ; a musical C tone that is one octave higher than the previous C tone has double the frequency .
The number of octaves control the amount of detail of Perlin noise .
Adding more octaves increases the detail of Perlin noise , with the added drawback of increasing the calculation time .
The following graphs show the outputs of one - dimensional Perlin - noise functions n( x ) with 1 , 2 , 4 , and 8 octaves .
In these graphs , o refers to the octave count .
Perlin noise A type of coherent noise that is the sum of several coherent - noise functions of ever - increasing frequencies and ever - decreasing amplitudes .
The following graphs show the outputs of several one - dimensional coherent - noise functions n( x ) .
Each graph shows a function with double the frequency and one - half the amplitude of the function from the previous graph .
In these graphs , f refers to frequency and a refers to amplitude .
The sum of these coherent - noise functions result in Perlin noise .
Each coherent - noise function that is part of a Perlin - noise function is called an octave .
These functions are called octaves because each function has , by default , double the frequency of the previous function ; musical tones have this property as well .
Perlin noise generated with more octaves produce more detailed coherent noise , at a cost of additional calculation time .
Perlin noise is fractal in nature ; a zoomed - in section of Perlin noise tends to look like the original section .
Natural objects also have this property ; for example , a twig from a tree resembles a branch of the tree , which in turn resembles the original tree .
Because of this property , Perlin noise is ideal for generating natural , self - similar textures such as granite , wood , marble , and clouds .
It is also ideal for generating realistic terrain .
Ken Perlin invented Perlin noise in ~1983 .
Because his invention is used everywhere in the special - effects industry , he won an Academy Award® .
See also : Lacunarity , Persistence
Persistence A multiplier that determines how quickly the amplitudes diminish for each successive octave in a Perlin - noise function .
The amplitude of each successive octave is equal to the product of the previous octave 's amplitude and the persistence value .
Increasing the persistence produces " rougher " Perlin noise .
The following graphs show the outputs of five - octave Perlin - noise functions n(x ) with persistence values of 3/4 , 1/2 , and 1 / 4 .
In these graphs , p refers to persistence .
A similar property to persistence is lacunarity , which modifies the octaves ' frequencies in a similar way .
Seed A value that changes the output of a coherent - noise function .
Seeds in coherent - noise functions are used in the same way as seeds in standard random - number generators .
By changing the seed of a coherent - noise function , you change its output values ; however , that function 's frequency and amplitude are not altered .
Solid noise A common term for three - dimensional coherent noise .
Solid noise is often used as three - dimensional procedural textures .
This is because one can " carve out " modeled objects from solid noise , like a sculptor carving a statue from marble .
Because each point in three - dimensional space has its own coherent - noise value , the resulting texture does not have any warps or creases .
An interesting consequence of this property is that if one cuts a piece out of the object , the texture inside of that object will mesh perfectly with the texture on the outside of the object .
The following image shows an object that has a solid noise texture .
Note that the texture does not warp anywhere on the object ; it is uniform throughout the object .
It would be very difficult to produce a non-warping two - dimensional texture map for this object .
Source module A noise module that is used as a source of output values for another noise module .
For example , the noise module noise : : module : : Add outputs the sum of the two source modules connected to it .
Each source module may also be connected to other source modules , and so on .
At a lunch last year celebrating his 25th anniversary with Jyllands - Posten , Kurt Westergaard told an anecdote .
During World War II Pablo Picasso met a German officer in southern France , and they got into a conversation .
When the German officer figured out whom he was talking to he said :
" Oh , you are the one who created Guernica ? " referring to the famous painting of the German bombing of a Basque town by that name in 1937 .
Picasso paused for a second , and replied , " No , it was n't me , it was you . "
For the past three months Mr. Westergaard and his wife have been on the run .
Mr. Westergaard did the most famous of the 12 Muhammad cartoons published in Jyllands - Posten in September 2005 -- the one depicting the prophet with a bomb in his turban .
The cartoon was a satirical comment on the fact that some Muslims are committing terrorist acts in the name of Islam and the prophet .
Tragically , Mr. Westergaard 's fate has proven the point of his cartoon :
In the early hours of Tuesday morning Danish police arrested three men who allegedly had been plotting to kill him .
In the past few days 17 Danish newspapers have published Mr. Westergaard 's cartoon , which is as truthful as Picasso 's painting .
My colleagues at Jyllands - Posten and I understand that the cartoon may be offensive to some people , but sometimes the truth can be very offensive .
As George Orwell put it in the suppressed preface to " Animal Farm " : " If liberty means anything , it means the right to tell people what they do not want to hear . "
Seems there ’s an aspect here of protesting a bit much on the State Department ’s part .
Amazingly , within 24 hours of the news of the snoops into Sen .
Obama ’s file , we have news that the same thing has happened to each of the other presidential candidates .
Presumably if Gov. Huckabee had done better in South Carolina we ’d be hearing that he got a look too .
The look at Sen .
Clinton ’s file was done by a trainee during a training session after an instructor asked a class to practice with random names .
So , really not in the same category .
And McCain ’s breach , well … not much information at all about that one , other than that it was done by one of the same people who snooped Obama .
Adding to the oddity is that the fact that the State Department seems much more solicitous of the privacy of these fired rule - breakers than the privacy of the president candidate (s ) being snooped .
State is still refusing to release the names of the snoopers or the contractors they worked for .
Living Plasmatron Oscillators and Psionic Helmets – Available Now !
Weird Santa Barbara Looks Again at the World Weird Web
Time machines are a staple of science fiction and daydreams alike .
From H.G. Wells ’ vision of a bizarrely distant future to thoughts of how wonderful it would be to go back to yesterday and remember to mail the taxes , time machines have lasting appeal .
It is strange , then , that everyone does n’t already own one , when they ’re readily available for only $ 500.00 readymade or $ 25.00 for the plans .
There ’s even a wide variety to choose from – the luxurious Hyper Dimensional Resonator may be a splurge , but for less than the cost of a moderate restaurant meal one can acquire the blueprints for a Flux Capacitor , a Plasmatron Oscillator , and a Fluxatron , all in one convenient package .
The same vendor , Secret Technology Labs , offers the Psionic Helmet , a “ mind focusing / tuning helmet ” for use in altering the thoughts of others .
Be warned , however ; the Psionic Helmet is not particularly discreet , and the first action to take when wearing it might be to telepathically urge others to ignore the odd - looking object on your head .
For those interested in controlling their own minds , rather than the minds of others , the Lucid Dream Goggles – only $ 290.00 !
– might be a more appropriate purchase .
These amazing eyepieces allow the wearer to induce lucid dreaming at any time .
On a more practical note , the Rife Machine 2 is an alternative medicine machine which , shockingly , Secret Technology Labs suggests has been repressed by the American Medical Association ( AMA ) .
Included in the Rife Machine 2 pack is a “ 21 day do - it - yourself cure for HIV ” which “ can easily be built from parts obtainable from Radio Shack . ”
For more common ailments , Secret Technology Labs recommends the “ painless ” Bio-Stimulator .
If you doubt the truth of these claims , well , more than one website ca n’t be wrong .
Other websites , such as Future Horizons Inc. also offer the Rife Machine .
Both Secret Technology Labs and Future Horizons inc. have flying saucers , and Future Horizons inc. also sells UFO detectors , which will “ detect any large metal objects moving through the air . ”
Locating UFOs or finding the airport will be made equally easy – the technology is multi-functional .
No , you say .
It ’s still not possible , despite the fact that at least two websites vouch for the existence of these seeming miracles .
And yet , the website of Secret Technology Labs , where all of these items may be purchased , guarantees that “ This technology is real and has been experienced by hundreads ( sic ) of people worldwide . ”
If only they ’d gone back in time and hired a copy editor .

Once again last week , the president and his men surged into the headlines , announcing that we had just zipped past yet another of those Iraqi “ turning points . ”
Or , as George W. Bush put it while speaking at the Pentagon ( and perhaps dreaming of the days back in 2005 when he could still happily mention “ victory ” 15 times and “ progress ” 28 times in a speech about Iraq ) : “ The surge is working .
And as a return on our success in Iraq , we ’ve begun bringing some of our troops home .
The surge has done more than turn the situation in Iraq around  it has opened the door to a major strategic victory in the broader war on terror . ”
A few years ago , of course , the Bush administration was still “ turning corners ” ( around which , invariably , would be an unexpected group of insurgents armed with RPGs and IEDs ) .
Now , in a change of linguistic pace , the corners have vanished ( perhaps because we have n’t liked who ’s lurking there ) and we ’re opening doors instead .
If history is any guide , behind the president ’s “ door ” will prove to be not the lady but the tiger .
In the meantime , our surly vice president has just surged past the American people .
In an interview in Oman with ABC ’s Martha Raddatz , there was this pungent exchange :
Raddatz : " [ T ] wo - thirds of Americans say [ the Iraq War ] ’s not worth fighting , and they ’re looking at the value gain versus the cost in American lives , certainly , and Iraqi lives . "
Cheney : " So ? ”
Perhaps the most revealing imagery of the week , however , came from the president ’s candidate for the Oval Office in January 2009 .
On completing a visit to “ Iraq , ” Sen .
John McCain issued a ringing statement on the war that began this way : “ Today in Iraq , America and our allies stand on the precipice of winning a major victory against radical Islamic extremism . ”
The “ precipice of victory ” and , next perhaps , the “ abyss of victory ” ?
Go back two years and that word “ precipice ” was a commonplace in Washington as a rattled Bush administration faced a sectarian civil war in Iraq .
Now , as any independent or foreign journalist would tell you ( though the American press has generally been more upbeat ) , the Iraqis are living in that abyss , down which Sen.
McCain evidently stares and sees victory .
They are living in a hell , a country so thoroughly dismantled that the brave British journalist Patrick Cockburn recently claimed “ Iraq ” was now little more than a “ geographical expression . ”
Outside the heavily fortified Green Zone , much of Baghdad is a nightmare .
Just consider a walk that Nir Rosen took for Rolling Stone magazine in the Dora district of Baghdad ( “ now a ghost town .
This is what ‘ victory ’ looks like in a once upscale neighborhood of Iraq : Lakes of mud and sewage fill the streets .
Mountains of trash stagnate in the pungent liquid .
Most of the windows in the sand - colored homes are broken , and the wind blows through them , whistling eerily ” ) ; or watch a video shot by Iraqi journalist Ghaith Abdul - Ahad for the British Guardian portraying the massive walls that now encase so many Iraqi neighborhoods , or the cemeteries he visited that hold some of Iraq ’s recently slaughtered citizens .
Soon , Gen. David Petraeus will report to the president and Congress on “ progress ” in Iraq .
In the meantime , Sen. McCain ’s Web site just “ re-released ” “ Fighting Islamic Extremists : Progress in Iraq , ” which “ features a four - year timeline of John McCain ’s unrelenting call for a new strategy for victory in Iraq . ”
Knowing that this may be their future , Iraqis must finally be on the verge of erupting with joy in the streets of their capital , just as our vice president predicted they would before this horror ever began .

The Battle of Baghdad
Iraq ’s most fearsome militia , the U.S. military , on the offensive
by Michael Schwartz
In early April , Gen. David Petraeus , the flavor of the year in American military officers , will return to Washington to report to President Bush and the Democratic Congress on the state of post - surge Iraq .
His report will be upbeat , with cautious notes thrown in , and the reception will be warm .
The Republicans will congratulate the president , hoping that Americans will stop complaining and finally learn to tolerate , if not love , his war ; the Democrats will be quietly unhappy because they would like Iraq to remain a major election issue .
In the meantime , the Iraqis will continue to endure the results of the surge , yet another brutal chapter in the endless war that once promised them liberation .
Over the course of five years , Baghdad , the capital city of Iraq , has been transformed from a metropolis into an urban desert of half - destroyed buildings and next to no public services , dotted by partially deserted , mutually hostile mini-ghettos that used to be neighborhoods , surrounded by cement barriers reminiscent of medieval fortifications .
The most prominent of these ghettos is the heavily fortified city - inside - a- city dubbed the Green Zone , where Iraq ’s most fearsome militia , the United States military , is headquartered .
It is governed by the Americans and by the American - sponsored Iraqi government , headed by Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki .
The remaining ghettos , large and small , are governed by local militias , most of them sworn enemies of the United States and the Maliki regime .
In the expanding Shia areas of the capital , the local guardians are often members of the Mahdi Army , the militia of cleric Moqtada al - Sadr that has opposed the American presence since the occupation began .
In the shrinking Sunni - controlled parts of the city , the local guardians are usually members of the Sahwa forces ( the “ Awakening ” or , in U.S. military jargon , “ Concerned Local Citizens ” ) .
The Americans have ceded to them control of their cement - enclosed domains as long as they discontinue insurgent attacks elsewhere .
As Baghdad ’s citizens continue to flee the threat of violence , ethnic cleansing , and economic destitution , the city waits  whether for a definitive military confrontation or some less violent change that will bring its long ordeal to an end .
How did this all come to be ?
Ethnic Cleansing Arrives in Baghdad
When the American occupation of Baghdad began in April 2003 , about half of the city ’s neighborhoods had no particular ethnic character .
In late 2004 , however , thousands of Sunnis , driven out of Fallujah and other insurgent strongholds by American offensives , began arriving in Baghdad .
In increasingly crowded neighborhoods , ethnic friction rose , as did Sunni anger at a Shia - dominated government that sent its troops into battle beside American ones .
Sunni militias , originally organized to deal with local crime ( after the Americans dismantled the Iraqi police force ) began to turn on Shia residents in some of the capital ’s 200 mixed neighborhoods .
Eventually , scattered acts of harassment were transformed into systematic campaigns of expulsion , justified by the housing needs of a rapidly growing multitude of Sunni refugees , and as retaliation for government - supported assaults on Sunni cities .
During 2005 , the first stream of displaced Shia began arriving in Baghdad ’s vast , already overcrowded Shia slum of Sadr City and in the Shia cities of southern Iraq .
In January 2006 , the bombing of the revered Shia shrine , the Golden Dome mosque in Samarra , triggered sweeping Shia reprisals against Sunni communities .
In the capital , a struggle for the dominance of mixed neighborhoods began .
Deadly battles between Shia and Sunni militias featured all weapons and methods of slaughter available , including car bombs and death squads .
Whichever side expelled the other , minority groups including Christians , Kurds , and Palestinians found themselves unwelcome and began to flee ( or die ) .
Ethnic cleansing now lay at the center of the spiraling violence in Baghdad .
The Americans Enter the Battle
In May 2006 , American forces first joined “ the battle for Baghdad ” in a significant way .
With the initiation of Operation Together Forward , the U.S. military began transferring combat brigades to the capital in an attempt to take control of Sunni and Shia militia strongholds .
This strategy , however , quickly proved itself ineffective .
In August 2006 , the New York Times reported that sectarian violence was “ spiraling out of control . ”
By the fall , the number of insurgents attacks in Baghdad had increased by 26 percent , and violent deaths reported at the city morgue had quadrupled .
The seeming paradox of an American pacification campaign generating more violence can be explained by looking at the mechanics of the offensive .
Despite their involvement in ethnic violence , the Sunni and Shia militias that the Americans sought to root out were also the forces of law and order in Baghdad ’s otherwise lawless neighborhoods .
They directed traffic , arrested and / or punished common criminals , and mediated disputes .
They also protected neighborhoods from outsiders , including American or Iraqi soldiers , suicide bombers , death squads , and criminal gangs .
Before the Americans entered the fray , the militia strongholds had been the least vulnerable to sectarian attack .
After all , their streets were saturated with armed men on the lookout for their enemies .
Ethnic violence was largely taking place in contested mixed neighborhoods .
In entering these strongholds , the U.S. military won tactical victories , chasing surviving militia members off the streets or even out of neighborhoods , which , without their local police and defense forces , were suddenly vulnerable to sectarian attack .
This vulnerability was all - too - vividly illustrated in Sadr City , the stronghold of the Sadrist movement .
As the home base of the Mahdi Army , this city - within - a - city had not experienced a car bomb attack in two years until American troops sealed it off , set up check points at key entrance and exit points , and began patrols aimed at hunting down Mahdi Army leaders they suspected of participating in death squads and of kidnapping an American soldier .
Local residents told New York Times reporter Sabrina Tavernise that the operation had “ forced Mahdi Army members who were patrolling the streets to vanish . ”
Soon after , the first car bombs were detonated .
The violence reached a crescendo in November 2006 , when a coordinated set of five car bombs killed at least 215 and wounded 257 .
Qusai Abdul - Wahab , a Sadrist member of parliament , spoke for many residents of the community when he told the Associated Press that the “ occupation forces are fully responsible for these acts . ”
Such events generated immense bitterness among Shia , who took them as proof that the Americans and the Iraqi government were concerned only with attacking the Mahdis , not suppressing jihadist attacks .
This encouraged their support of the death squads , which sought to exact retribution on the Sunni communities they believed were harboring the bombers .
The Americans had also facilitated these retaliatory attacks .
Sunni insurgents in the Baghdad suburbs of Balad and Duluiyah , for example , were suspected of slaughtering 17 Shia workers in a particularly well publicized instance of sectarian brutality .
American troops and their Iraqi allies cordoned off the two districts and invaded the neighborhoods .
The invading forces quickly silenced the insurgent militias , leaving the streets unpatrolled .
Soon after , Shia death squads made their appearance .
Some of them had apparently been organized inside ( Shia ) Iraqi military units that accompanied the Americans into the Sunni communities .
According to the Washington Post , “ A police officer in Duluiyah , Capt .
Qaid al - Azawi , accused American forces of standing by in Balad while [ Shia ] militiamen in police cars and police uniforms slaughtered Sunnis . ”
In the face of these attacks , large numbers of residents began to flee .
And so the cycle of slaughter escalated on all sides , while neighborhoods began to be emptied of the members of whichever sect was losing ground locally .
As with many other developments in the war , this unmitigated disaster for Baghdad residents was only a partial one for the American occupation .
For the Bush administration , the storm of violence in the Iraqi capital had at least one silver lining : the occupation ’s two main enemies were now at each other ’s throats .
As an American intelligence official told investigative reporter Seymour Hersh , “ The White House believes that if American troops stay in Iraq long enough  with enough troops  the bad guys will end up killing each other . ”
The Surge
As Operation Together Forward continued , intense violence spread across the city .
American combat fatalities reached a two - year high of 113 in November 2006 , not in itself surprising since American troops were entering militia strongholds .
Other statistics , however , defied American expectations .
The number of insurgent attacks , which should have declined , increased dramatically .
A little under 100 a day through the first half of 2006 , they jolted up to 140 a day soon after the offensive started , and then hovered between 160 and 180 for the rest of the year .
The number of lethal bombings , a main target of the offensive , also rose .
According to U.S. military statistics published by the Brookings Institution , in late 2005 they rose from under 20 to over 40 per month , and then started upward again as the American offensive began in the late spring of 2006 , reaching 69 in December of that year .
Deaths associated with these bombings soared from under 500 per month in early 2006 to almost 1,000 in the second half of the year .
Population displacement also reached new heights  especially in communities where the Americans were most active .
In response , the Americans sought a new plan for pacifying Baghdad .
It would become known as “ the surge . ”
Rather than altering the fundamental premises of Operation Together Forward , it diagnosed the ferocious response as evidence that insufficient force had been applied .
Now , tens of thousands of new American troops would be poured into Baghdad , and to Operation Together Forward ’s strategy would be added tactics from the 2004 assault on the Sunni city of Fallujah .
Each target area would now first be surrounded to prevent insurgents from escaping .
Then , once the battle was joined , overwhelming firepower would be brought to bear .
As Capt .
Paul Fowler had explained to Boston Globe reporter Anne Barnard during the Fallujah fighting , ” The only way to root out [ the insurgents ] is to destroy everything in your path . ”
As in Fallujah , the new surge plan also called for the Americans to remain in the community to prevent the insurgents from returning and to supervise the Iraqi army units they had led into battle .
The Battle of Haifa Street
Even before the surge strategy was announced by President Bush , even before the new troops arrived , the first battle was launched .
Before dawn on Jan. 9 , 2007 , the Americans and Iraqis attacked a Sunni insurgent stronghold on Haifa Street just outside the Green Zone .
Washington
Post reporters Sudarsan Raghavan and Joshua Partlow described the kind of firepower brought to bear once the battle for the street began :
“ From rooftops and doorways , the gunmen fired AK - 47 assault rifles and machine guns .
Snipers also were targeting the U.S. and Iraqi soldiers .
U.S. soldiers started firing back with 50 - caliber machine guns mounted on their Stryker armored vehicles .
They used TOW missiles and Mark - 19 grenade launchers .
The F - 15 fighter jets strafed rooftops with cannons , while the [ Apache helicopters ] fired Hellfire missiles . ”
After 11 hours of death and devastation , 1,000 American and Iraqi troops were able to begin house - to - house searches , arresting or killing suspected insurgents .
One week later , McClatchy News reporters Nancy Youssef and Zaineb Obeid visited Haifa Street .
They found massive destruction , omnipresent U.S. military forces locking down virtually all activity , widespread suffering among residents , and ongoing fighting .
Elements of the Shia - dominated Iraqi army had already begun a systematic campaign to push the Sunni majority from the neighborhood :
“ A 44 - year - old Haifa Street resident , who asked to be identified only as Abu Mohammed for security reasons , said that only three or four [ Sunni ] families of an estimated 60 families remained on his block .
He said no vehicles were allowed to drive through the area and that there was no electricity , kerosene or running water .
[ U.S. ]
Snipers have taken positions on the rooftops . ”
To the fleeing Sunnis , it seemed the Americans were sponsoring ethnic cleansing .
A resident commented : “ The Americans are doing nothing , as if they are backing the militias .
If this plan continues for one more week , I do n’t think you will find one family left on Haifa Street . ”
By the end of January , before the first surge reinforcements even arrived , the battle of Haifa Street was over .
A large contingent of American soldiers would remain in the area , while a vast cement barrier with a handful of heavily armored gates would be put in place , effectively separating the community from the rest of the city .
The dislodged insurgents retreated into intermittent guerrilla war , organizing some 20 attacks on the Americans each month  a sharp reduction from the 74 much larger battles they had fought in January .
U.S. forces would mount an average of 34 combat patrols each day aimed at capturing or suppressing them .
In January 2008 , plans for an American departure from Haifa Street were still tentative .
The Results of the Surge
Haifa Street would become typical of many Baghdad communities that soon felt the full impact of the surge offensive .
A year later , the neighborhood would still bear all the marks of battle .
There had been no effort to restore public services , including the electrical grid or the system that should have supplied potable water ; there were no medical services , nor was there any public transportation .
The New York Post ‘s Ralph Peters summarized the posture of the Maliki government inside the Green Zone bluntly : “ Iraq ’s government is n’t much help  none , as far as Haifa Street ’s revival is concerned . ”
The American military commander on Haifa Street told him that the U.S. was relying on “ spontaneous economic development ”  local citizens were expected to develop the area through their own efforts , with the help of a limited number of “ micro- loans ” ( a few hundred dollars each ) from the military ’s meager non-combat funds .
It was no surprise , then , that , aside from a few food markets , there was no economy to speak of .
In the meantime , tens of thousands of mainly Sunni residents had left , with large parts of the area transformed from Sunni to Shia , and smaller sections moving in the other direction .
In January 2008 , Lt. Col. Tony Aguto , the U.S. commander in Haifa Street , estimated that some 50,000 of the area ’s 150,000 residents had been displaced in the previous year .
In Baghdad as a whole , the United Nations High Commissioner on Refugees would estimate that the heavy surge fighting in the first half of 2007 was producing 90,000 refugees a month , the bulk from Baghdad ; the 2007 total reached 800,000 .
As ethnic cleansing in Haifa Street and elsewhere was completed , the rate of refugee production began to drop , declining to 30,000 by December 2007 .
Displaced Baghdadis searching desperately for places to settle faced the overwhelming challenge of supporting families in a largely dormant economy with dwindling government support .
This was not , commented Lt. Col.
Aguto , a problem the Americans needed to address .
“ It is , ” he said , “ the job of the Iraqi government to sort this out . ”
The Iraqi government remained mute on the subject .
The Ebb of the Surge
As the battle of Haifa Street illustrated , the surge amplified violence in the capital significantly , as for six months the Americans moved in on one neighborhood after another , using all the firepower at their command .
When the heavy fighting ended in an invaded neighborhood , the Americans sought to consolidate their military victory by erecting those now - ubiquitous concrete barriers , ensuring the ethnic segregation of each neighborhood or partial neighborhood .
These became demarcation lines and no - go boundaries in the city ’s civil war , the borders of a disintegrated city .
The walls insured that there would be little or no physical , social , or economic contact among ghettoized , ethnically cleansed neighborhoods , even ones that had previously depended upon such intercourse for daily sustenance .
The city ’s already compromised economy thus suffered another body blow .
Residents of these newly defined ghettos , unable to get to jobs , became increasingly desperate , and , searching for solutions , lent support to the local militias that spoke and acted on their behalf .
As displacement efforts continued , the Shia militias essentially moved east to west across Baghdad , creating ever more Shia areas from previously mixed and Sunni neighborhoods .
Mainly in the western and southern parts of Baghdad , the Sunni militias persevered , consolidating their control in areas that the Americans did not invade .
The ghettoization of Baghdad , which had begun relatively modestly in early 2005 , reached a crescendo in early 2007 with the American surge and was largely completed by the fall of 2007 .
By that time , what had once been a city split between Sunnis and Shia had been transformed into a 75 percent Shia capital .
The American military made its presence felt at checkpoints , at many small bases established around the city , and by patrols into neighborhoods now demarcated by cement barriers .
The localities , however , were still governed by the local militias in what was no longer city , but a ghettoized collection of micro-city - states .
The End of the Surge
After a spring and summer of heavy fighting , however , the Americans were hardly close to pacifying the city .
In a way , the surge had worsened the situation .
Before it began , in many neighborhoods neither Sunni nor Shia militias were dominant ; by the middle of 2007 , virtually every community had its own mini-government , usually dominated by a militia that was hostile both to the occupation and the central government .
To assert centralized authority over the city , each neighborhood would have had to be invaded again .
Without announcing a change in policy , the Americans functionally abandoned the surge in the late summer 2007 in favor of a “ live and let live ” program of co-optation .
On the Sunni side of the street , the Americans adopted a version of the Sunni “ Awakening ” movement that had arisen without American encouragement in Anbar Province the previous year , negotiating armed truces with their insurgent adversaries on a community - by - community basis .
The Americans conceded to the militias the right to police their own communities , discontinued American offensives aimed at dislodging them , and halted the hated home invasions aimed at arresting or killing suspected insurgents .
In exchange , the insurgents were to rein in attacks on American troops and suppress jihadist activity in their neighborhoods , thus curtailing the planning and execution of car bomb and other terrorist attacks on nearby Shia communities .
On the Shia side , the Americans essentially negotiated a ceasefire with the Mahdi Army , announced publicly as a unilateral stand - down by its leader Moqtada al - Sadr .
The Sadrists curtailed the planting of lethal roadside bombs against the Americans and no longer sought to ambush American and Iraqi army troops moving through their neighborhoods .
The Americans curtailed their raids and offensives in Sadrist neighborhoods and spent far less effort hunting down and arresting Sadrist leaders , except when they specifically broke the cease - fire .
The result of this double détente was a dramatic reduction in violence in Baghdad .
With the Americans keeping their side of the bargain , the huge running battles associated with American attacks on Sunni strongholds like Haifa Street disappeared , and even the smaller battles resulting from American attempts to capture specific insurgents subsided .
In return , attacks against American forward bases and convoys in Baghdad dwindled ; and the jihadists , largely expelled from Sunni insurgent communities , either demobilized or moved to northern Iraq where negotiations with the insurgents had not taken place .
This was , however , little more than an armed truce among enemies , a truce that actually strengthened the militias within their own communities .
The Sunni insurgents , now validated as legitimate police and even paid and armed by the Americans , began making political demands for the restoration of services , as well as for infrastructure reconstruction and job - creation programs for their desperate constituents , all the while denouncing the Iraqi government as a creature of U.S. and Iranian policy .
The Mahdi Army militias , having extended their influence into previously mixed neighborhoods , used the truce to spread their own meager but meaningful social service programs and demand increased access to resources that might revive the economy of the city .
Their national spokesmen continued to insist that the country could not begin genuine reconstruction until the Americans left , and that the barriers they had played such a role in erecting  sectarian as well as cement  were removed .
Though many Baghdad communities are now experiencing their lowest levels of violence in two years , their situations are neither viable , nor stable .
The cement barriers , which help to reduce violence , also make social and economic life nearly impossible .
Most Baghdadis are now locked into their individual ghettos , terrified of strangers , often afraid to send their children to schools across barriers and neighborhoods , and unable to reach previously held jobs .
Employers , deprived of needed workers and customers , have shuttered their establishments .
The economy has largely ground to a halt .
For most of Baghdad , the Iraqi government is simply irrelevant .
It has no administrative apparatus in any of these communities or the capacity to restore needed services .
Its only visible presence , the Iraqi army , is commanded or controlled by American officers ; insofar as Iraqi soldiers do act independently , they follow the leadership of Shia militia commanders , not the central government .
In neighborhoods even a few hundred feet from the Green Zone , the Iraqi government does not exist .
The Americans remain a major presence , but not a sovereign one .
They maintain the most fearsome of the militias in Baghdad , capable of militarily overwhelming any adversary , but incapable of creating stable rule , even in cement - encircled ghost areas like Haifa Street .
They cannot deliver electricity , or water , or jobs , or even , often enough , safe passage to the next neighborhood .
As early as May 2006 , Nir Rosen , one of the most informed and insightful journalists writing about Iraq , presciently described the American military ’s unenviable position in this way : “ [ T ]he American Army is lost in Iraq , as it has been since it arrived .
Striking at Sunnis , striking at Shias , striking at mostly innocent people .
Unable to distinguish between anybody , certainly unable to wield any power , except on the immediate street corner where it ’s located .
[ T ]he Americans are just one more militia lost in the anarchy . ”
This description was never truer than today in Baghdad .
The residents of Baghdad are waiting .
They are waiting for the walls around their neighborhood to come down , public transportation to be restored , and roads to be re-opened so they can begin to move around the city in something like a normal fashion .
They wait for public services to be rebuilt so they can count on turning on the lights , having clean water come out of taps , and perhaps even being able to contribute to “ spontaneous economic development . ”
They wait for employers to begin rehiring , so they can begin to support their suffering families .
They wait for the Americans to leave .
In a few weeks , Gen. David Petraeus will tell the president and Congress that violence is dramatically reduced in Baghdad , that there are signs of political progress inside the Green Zone , and that these gains will be lost if the United States does not “ stay the course . ”
He will not say that Baghdad is an urban desert of half - destroyed buildings and next to no public services , dotted by partially deserted , mutually hostile mini-ghettos that used to be neighborhoods , surrounded by cement barriers reminiscent of medieval fortifications .

When national drug use trends among adolescents go up or down , the risk of marijuana use among deviance - prone male youth also goes up or down .
Among deviance - prone female youth , it does not , according to a study in the March issue of Prevention Science .
The risk of marijuana use among deviance - prone boys is a reflection of the social acceptance of drug use among adolescents .
The risk among deviance prone girls , however , does not change with shifts in the popularity of drug use .
Deviance prone girls are just as likely to use marijuana during years of high and low national use .
The study , based on data collected from 44,751 students from the 12th grade from 1979 to 2004 , also showed that deviance proneness is not only related to regular , more problematic use of marijuana , but is also related to occasional use of the drug .
Michelle Little , Ph.D. , of the Prevention Research Center at Arizona State University in Tempe , who is the lead author of the study , said the findings are important for prevention programs .
" Parents and teachers need to be aware that historically , even those teens that use marijuana occasionally have been more likely to show antisocial or risky behavior .
Also it appears that adolescents ' social rejection of marijuana use has been a powerful drug-use deterrent .
Therefore , to prevent drug use , we need to drive down social acceptance of marijuana use among all adolescents through a variety of media campaigns and risk - focused prevention programs .
We should also combine that with drug use prevention programs targeted for deviance prone male and female teens , " Little said .
The study measured " deviance proneness " based on a variety of factors , including criminal behavior , such as shop lifting or property damage ; truancy ; low pro-social commitments to school and religion ; and thrill seeking .
Regular marijuana use was defined as weekly marijuana use ; occasional use was defined as up to three times per month .
Regular and occasional use cutoffs are based on current understanding of drug usage levels that are related to social , personal and family problems among teens .
While previous studies have shown the relationship between a deviance - prone profile and frequency of drug use , " this is the first study to establish this relationship across 26 years of national historical data for both male and female youth , " according to Little .
The findings of her study are restricted to Caucasian or European - American youth .
They do not extend to African - American or Latino students because those groups were not represented in the sample in sufficient numbers for statistical reliability .
Adolescent marijuana use declined significantly between 1979 and 1992 and then went up again by 1997 - 1999 .
Adolescent social approval of marijuana was at a contemporary low in 1992 .
" During times of low population use of marijuana , male youth who are deviance prone are more likely to limit their use of marijuana than during historical peaks in adolescent marijuana use .
This suggests that deviance - prone male youth respond to the social acceptance of marijuana use .
By contrast , the data shows that deviance - prone girls do not necessarily respond in similar fashion .
Deviance - prone female teens show similar risk for marijuana use during years of high and low national use , " according to Little .
During the 26 years of the study , on average , 61.1 % of high school seniors did not use marijuana , 29.9 % used it occasionally or up to 3 times a month , and 9 % were regular users .
The study was based on data from the Monitoring the Future , a prominent national survey of drug use conducted by the University of Michigan .
Peak Oil - True or False
OILY ECONOMICS : Peak Oil - True or False by Stephen Lendman
It now comes down to this .
Western technology is built around fossil fuel development .
But if the future is abiotic , as Engdahl and Russian scientists believe , " Moscow holds a massive energy trump card . "
T he arguments are so one - sided , it 's practically a given that " peak oil " is real and threatening .
Or is it ?
This article examines both sides .
It lets readers decide and deals only with supply issues , not crucial environmental ones and the need to develop alternative energy sources .
First some background .
The name most associated with " peak oil " is M. King Hubbert .
He became the world 's best known geologist when he worked for Houston - based Shell Oil Company from 1943 to 1964 .
His theory goes something like this .
Oil is a finite resource .
Peak oil , or Hubbert 's peak , is the point at which maximum world production is reached , after which its rate terminally declines .
Hubbert first presented his theory in a February 4 , 1949 Science magazine article called " Energy from Fossil Fuels . "
He gained prominence , however , from his 1956 American Petroleum Institute presentation titled " Nuclear Energy and the Fossil Fuels . "
In it , he predicted that US production would peak between the mid-1960s and early 1970s , and he was largely right ( for the wrong reasons at the time ) about cheap or what 's called light sweet oil .
Most analysts believe US output peaked in 1970 and has since declined .
Others , like economist and author F. William Engdahl , disagree .
He 's been researching oil issues since the early 1970s and believes US output peaked at the time but not because of resource depletion .
It 's " because Shell , Mobil , Texaco and the other partners of Saudi Aramco were flooding the US market with dirt cheap Middle East imports , tariff free , ( and ) at prices so low ( that ) many Texas domestic producers could not compete and " had to shutter their operations .
But Hubbert went further as well .
He predicted a worldwide peak in " about half a century " that would progress in bell - shaped curve fashion , now called " Hubbert 's curve . "
Here 's how it works for all fossil fuels .
Hubbert theorized that after discovery , production increases exponentially , but at some point peak output is reached , after which an exponential decline ensues .
Hubbert 's curve is symmetrical , it peaks when half of all oil ( or other fossil fuel ) has been produced , and there 's only a single peak after which output declines .
Hubbert 's analysis was at a time oil nominally cost under $ 3 a barrel .
Inflation - adjusted that 's around $ 23 in 2008 dollars .
Today it 's around $ 100 , and some analysts see it heading much higher as the supply of cheap oil declines in the face of growing demand .
True or false will only be known in the fullness of time , but consider what Hubbert , in fact , said in his 1956 paper .
He estimated : a " total ultimate potential reserve of 150 billion barrels of crude oil for both land and offshore areas of the United States " and acknowledged he was " in substantial agreement with Pratt 's figure of 170 billion barrels .... ;" and
a potential of 1.250 trillion " barrels ( for ) the whole world . "
So far , Hubbert was referring to what 's called " light sweet " or cheap oil .
But he went further as well , yet his comments have been largely ignored .
He mentioned other type oils and estimated : " the oil obtainable from oil shales in the United States " is one trillion barrels based on current ( 1956 ) US Geological Survey figures ; outside the US , he estimated oil shale potential in Brazil at between 300 to 500 billion barrels with " negligible " amounts present in other countries ;
the Athabaska tar sands in northeastern Alberta , Canada are the " largest known deposit ( s ) .... in the world ; " its " extractable oil content .... is still not accurately known , but current estimates range from about 300 to 500 billion barrels .... ; " and
" other large ( nonconventional oil ) deposits of uncertain magnitude exist in eastern Venezuela and in Mesopotamia ( Iraq ) ; " these and others like them in the world " might be as much as ( another ) 800 billion barrels . "
Hubbert then stated : " .... the culmination of world ( oil ) production ( of the cheap variety ) .... should occur within about half a century ( and within ) the United States .... within the next few decades . "
However : " This does not necessarily imply that the United States or other parts of the industrial world will soon become destitute of liquid ( oil ) and gaseous fuels , because these can be produced from other fossil fuels ( including tar sands , heavy and extra - heavy oils and shale ) which occur in much greater abundance . "
In 1956 , his and other estimates of their amounts were far below today 's figures .
More on that below .
Current Opposing Views on Peak Oil The German - based Energy Watch Group ( EWG ) believes peak oil is real .
It 's an " international network of scientists and parliamentarians " that published an October 2007 report with that view .
It stated world oil production peaked in 2006 , output is now declining by several percent a year , and by 2020 to 2030 global oil reserves will be substantially lower than today and a supply gap will exist .
Daniel Yergin's Cambridge Energy Research Associates ( CERA ) disagrees .
Its analysis finds that " the remaining global oil resource base is actually 3.74 trillion barrels - three times as large as the ( claimed ) 1.2 trillion barrels by ( peak oil ) proponents . "
CERA argues further that peak oil reasoning is faulty and , " if accepted , ( may ) distort critical policy and investment decisions and cloud the debate over the energy future . "
It states as well that the " global resource base of conventional and unconventional oils .... is 4.82 trillion barrels and likely to grow " and bases its analysis on fields now in production and those " yet - to - be produced or discovered . "
Its chairman , Daniel Yergin , noted that : " This is the fifth time that the world is said to be running out of oil .
Each time .... technology and the opening of new frontier areas has banished the specter of decline .
There 's no reason to think that technology is finished this time . "
The Paris - based International Energy Agency ( AIE ) agrees .
It 's an energy policy advisor to its 27 member countries that was founded by the OECD in 1974 in the wake of that period 's oil crisis .
It believes peak oil notions are extreme , says there 's " no shortage of available oil and gas in the ground , " but new technologies must be found to curb " the world 's thirst for them ( and to ) tap reserves " to increase production .
AIE believes as much as 10 trillion barrels of " oil equivalent " conventional oil and gas exist and at least as much non-conventional oil .
In a 2005 report it stated that : " The hydrocarbon resources in place around the world are sufficiently abundant to sustain likely growth in the global energy system for the foreseeable future .
The doomsayers are again conveying grim messages through ( the media ) .
The AIE has long maintained that none of this is cause for concern . "
AIE considers all type oils - the easy to find and produce " light sweet " kind that 's likely running out plus potentially huge untapped deposits of heavier oils that will become more important when it does .
With this in mind , the Middle East does n't have two - thirds of world oil reserves as many analysts , the industry , and US Department of Energy claim .
It has two - thirds of " proved " cheap oil reserves .
The US Geological Survey ( USGS ) collects data on all type oils and estimates their amounts .
For the year 2000 , the US Department of Energy ( DOE ) and oil industry estimated remaining " proved " light sweet reserves at slightly over one trillion barrels .
USGS , however , placed " identified " reserves at 1.1 trillion barrels and " recoverable " reserves at nearly 2.3 trillion or more than double the industry and DOE amounts .
In addition , USGS estimates combined non-conventional heavy and tar sands deposits at around 4.250 trillion barrels with about 3.6 trillion of them in the two countries with most of them - Canada and Venezuela .
Other " unconventional " oil estimates differ widely , so take your choice on who to believe .
Dutch economists Peter Odell and Kenneth Rosing had an earlier view in their 1980 book " The Future of Oil . "
They noted predictions of total world reserves ranged from two to 11 trillion barrels and said three trillion was " the more realistic figure " for conventional oil plus another two trillion from unconventional heavy oil and tar sands .
Petroleum Economist magazine calls itself " the authority on energy . "
It says tar ( or oil ) sands reserves are huge , they occur in over 70 countries , and Canada has most of them ( around 81 % ) in four regions : Athabasca , Wabasca , Cold lake and Peace River in areas covering around 77,000 km .
It estimates technically recoverable reserves at between 280 - 300 billion barrels with total non-recoverable ( based on current technology ) amounts at between 1.7 - 2.5 trillion barrels .
Other than shale , USGS categorizes oil as light , heavy , extra - heavy and natural bitumen or tar / oil sands .
Some analysts believe oil sands can replace conventional oil when its supply runs out while others disagree .
One of them is Richard Heinberg , who 's written extensively on ecological and peak oil issues .
He says that although estimated oil sands reserves equal or exceed all conventional oil extracted to date , processing them reduces their potential for reasons geologist Walter Youngquist explains : because " it takes the equivalent of two out of each three barrels of oil recovered to pay for all the energy and other costs involved in getting oil from the oil sands . "
Then , there 's the environmental cost .
It takes two tons of sand mined to yield one barrel of oil , and extracting it requires huge amounts of natural gas and water .
In addition , each barrel recovered yields 2.5 barrels of oily waste that must be disposed of .
It 's done by pumping it into huge ponds , and Heinberg describes a Syncrude Canada Ltd. one that 's 14 miles in circumference in which 20 feet of murky water floats on a 130 - foot - thick slurry of sand , silt , clay and unrecovered oil .
It 's nightmarish and so environmentally destructive that northern Alberta residents want all oil sands plants shuttered because they 've displaced native people , destroyed boreal forests , caused livestock deaths and increased the level of miscarriages .
It 's nightmarish and so environmentally destructive that northern Alberta residents want all oil sands plants shuttered because they 've displaced native people , destroyed boreal forests , caused livestock deaths and increased the level of miscarriages .
Moreover , Heinberg believes it would take about 700 plants the size of a Syncrude Athabasca one to process enough tar sands to replace conventional oil , and their environmental damage would be unimaginable and too great a cost to bear .
Another resource assessment comes from Petroleum Equities .
It 's a management consulting firm specializing in oil and gas exploration and production .
It estimates combined heavy oil and tar sands worldwide reserves at around 5.4 trillion barrels with 80 % of them in the western hemisphere .
For extra -heavy oil alone , the US Department of Energy ( on its web site ) estimates Venezuela has 1.36 trillion barrels , or 90 % of the world total .
That 's more than all " proved " world reserves combined .
For extra -heavy oil alone , the US Department of Energy ( on its web site ) estimates Venezuela has 1.36 trillion barrels , or 90 % of the world total .
That 's more than all " proved " world reserves combined and in addition to Venezuela 's " proved " light sweet resources of around 80 billion barrels that alone ranks it seventh in the world behind the five largest Middle East producers and Canada .
Potential Arctic Oil Reserves
On its web site ( arcticoag.com ) , the Arctic Oil and Gas Corporation states it 's " an oil exploration venture company that has filed for the exclusive exploitation , development , marketing and extraction rights to the oil and gas resources of the seafloor and subsurface contained within the ' Arctic Claims . ' "
It calls the Arctic " the last giant oil frontier on Earth ( with its ) vast reserves of untapped oil and natural gas ( that will ) become accessible ( when ) new deep - sea drilling and hydrocarbons production technology ( is ) available . "
In addition , it states that a preliminary USGS assessment " suggests the Arctic seabed may hold as much as 25 per cent of the world 's undiscovered oil and natural gas reserves ( or around 400 billion barrels of oil alone . ) "
It further says that Arctic oil source rocks may contain " untold billions of tons of organic sediments " and calls the 80 million acre Arctic Ocean Commons Prospect Claim " the world 's largest ( potential ) material prize . "
Here 's what USGS , in fact , said in October 2007 .
It called the above claim " a reporter 's mistake " but does n't rule out that it 's true .
It explained that the 25 % figure came from an assessment of seven oil and gas basins that were n't precisely in the Arctic .
One of them in East Siberia lies entirely south of it .
Exclude it and what 's left is 14 % .
However , because a 2000 USGS assessment did n't include undiscovered resources from all north of the Arctic basins ( numbering many more than seven ) , the area 's potential is vast but undetermined .
USGS explained that it did n't fully assess the area in 2000 because it lacked enough data at the time .
However , it 's now investigating all Arctic regions , using available geologic information and " a methodology adapted to a general shortage of well and seismic data . "
USGS concludes that the region 's potential is vast , it 's largely unexplored , its resources are " poorly understood , " and it can only produce a " broad view " of the region 's potential " because the ( area's ) geologic uncertainties are very high and the technical uncertainties ( of ) oil and gas extraction ( feasibility ) even higher . "
Two Notable Peak Oil Proponents
There 's no shortage of peak oil proponents , many are prominent figures , two among them stand out , and one is a media regular on his views , right or wrong .
He 's Matthew Simmons , chairman and CEO of Simmons & Company , an industry - insider , close associate of Dick Cheney and advisor and possible secret member of Cheney 's Energy Task Force representing Big Oil interests .
He 's also a major Republican donor and author of the 2005 book " Twilight in the Desert : The Coming Saudi Oil Shock and the World Economy . "
In it , Simmons is alarmist about the world 's largest producing country , and he 's widely heard and believed .
Right or wrong , he states that Saudi oil fields are " at or very near ( their ) peak sustainable volume ( and they 'll ) likely .... go into decline in the very foreseeable future . "
In addition , there 's little chance of discovering new fields to make up the difference .
These views make headlines and move markets .
So with oil prices around $ 100 a barrel and Simmons an industry insider and prominent doomsayer , consider the possibility there 's something rotten in the oil patch allowing Big Oil to profit hugely .
Further confirmation comes from a February 28 Arabian Business article .
In it , Simmons calls $ 100 oil " cheap " because " the supply is showing some very troubling signs that we might well have already peaked and started ( to slow ) down .... Demand on the other hand shows absolutely no sign of slowing down , " so oil prices could top $ 300 a barrel within five years . "
Simmons repeats this view on US television .
Geologist Colin Campbell is another peak oil proponent and author of many papers on the subject .
He 's just as bleak in his outlook and states it in " The Coming Oil Crisis and Oil Depletion - The Heart of the Matter , " that he wrote for The Association for the Study of Peak Oil and Gas ( ASPO ) .
He 's their founder , former president and currently their honorary chairman .
Campbell believes world output peaked , and in another of his papers , " Peak Oil : an Outlook on Crude Oil Depletion , " stated : Peak Oil " is a turning point for Mankind , which will affect everyone .... its discovery peaked in the 1960s .... gas.... will likely peak around 2020 .... non - conventional oil delays peak only a few years .... we 're not facing a re-run of the ( 1970s ) Oil Shocks .
They were like .... tremors .... we now face ( an ) earthquake ....
It is not a temporary interruption but the onset of a permanent new condition . "
Campbell also wrote " Understanding Peak Oil " on APSO 's web site in which he further says that debating the precise date of peak oil " misses the point . "
What really matters is " the long remorseless decline ( that 's ) on the other side of it .
The transition to decline threatens to be a time of great international tension .
Petroleum Man will be virtually extinct this Century , and Homo sapiens faces a major challenge in adapting to his loss .
Peak Oil is by all means an important subject . "
These type comments and more from Campbell 's 2005 book " Oil Crisis " can scare anyone .
They also explain today 's geopolitics , the strategic importance of oil , the reason its price is so high , and why the US is waging global wars " that wo n't end in our lifetime . "
A Peak Oil Contrarian F. William Engdahl once accepted peak oil analysis , but no longer does .
He explains why in his writing , and this section summarizes his reasoning .
It 's based on the Russian - Ukrainian theory that oil originated from deep carbon deposits dating as far back as the earth 's formation .
It 's not a fossil fuel or of biological origin , and its potential may be far greater than current hydrocarbon estimates .
According to Engdahl and others sharing this view , peak oil adherents believe oil is a fossil fuel , its origin is biological , its supply finite , and it's only found in areas where it was " geologically trapped millions of years ago .... in underground reservoirs ( around ) 4-6000 feet below the surface of the earth . "
At times , large amounts may also be in shallow water offshore rock formations in places like the Gulf of Mexico , North Sea or Gulf of Guinea .
In any event , prevailing reasoning is that it 's running out , and it's a just a matter of deciding how much is left and when it no longer will be available in amounts needed to sustain world economies .
Peak oil proponents believe the time is fast approaching .
Petroleum science dates from the year 1757 when Russian scholar Mikhailo Lomonosov hypothesized that oil 's origin might be biological .
In the early 19th century , two scientists disagreed - German naturalist and geologist Alexander von Humboldt and French chemist and thermodynamicist Louis Joseph Gay - Lussac .
Together they proposed that oil is primordial matter , it erupted from deep within the earth , and it has no connection to biological material nearer the surface .
Later in the century , others held similar views - most notably the Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev ( the father of the Periodic Table of chemical elements ) and French chemist Marcellin Berthelot .
Mendeleev , in particular , believed that " petroleum was born in the depths of the earth ( called " deep faults " ) , and it is only there that we must seek its origin . "
Modern petroleum science dates from the end of WW II when the Cold War began and the former Soviet Union faced isolation from the West .
At the time , its scientists believed the country was in trouble .
It had limited reserves and was shut out of many parts of the world for supply .
It thus became imperative to find new deposits inside the country .
So its scientists at the Institute of the Physics of the Earth of the Russian Academy of Sciences and the Institute of Geological Sciences of the Ukraine Academy of Sciences set out to do it .
They studied oil 's origin , how reserves are generated , and the most effective exploration methods to extract it .
In 1951 , Nikolai Kudryavtsev proposed the first modern deep abiotic oil origins theory at the All - Union petroleum geology congress .
He discounted claims about oil 's biological origin and was joined by other Russian and Ukrainian geologists , including Vladimir Porfir 'yev .
The abiotic origin theory — largely unacknowledged in the West — is that " Crude oil and natural petroleum have no intrinsic connection with biological matter .... "
Rather , they 're " primordial materials which have been erupted from great depths . "
Believing their supply is limited may be a convenient mistake to keep prices high .
In 1956 , Porfir 'yev announced their conclusions that even now are largely unacknowledged in the West : that " Crude oil and natural petroleum have no intrinsic connection with biological matter originating near the surface of the earth . "
They 're " primordial materials which have been erupted from great depths , " and believing their supply is limited is a hoax to keep prices high at times like now .
The theory rests on the abiotic origin of oil .
It 's mirror opposite orthodox geology , and , if right , here 's what it means - that available oil is only limited by deep earth organic hydrocarbon constituents at the time of the planet 's formation , and technological advances will eventually tap them in ultra - deep reservoirs and from old fields believed to be barren .
The theory defies conventional science , but it 's paying off .
It let Soviet Russia develop huge oil and gas fields in regions previously thought unsuitable .
In the 1990s , it was also successfully used in the Dnieper - Donets Basin between Russia and Ukraine in areas considered barren .
Sixty - one wells were drilled of which 37 ( 60 % ) proved out .
Engdahl compares this to US wildcat drilling that produces 90 % dry holes .
Russia 's success was largely unknown in the West until Pentagon strategists , just recently , considered a disturbing possibility - that the country 's geophysicists might know " something of profound strategic importance . "
If Russian energy know - how exceeds the West , it holds " a strategic trump card of staggering geopolitical import . "
It also explains why Washington surrounds the country with military bases and targets it with anti-ballistic missiles and radar for offense , not defense .
It 's " to cut her pipeline and port links to western Europe , China and the rest of Eurasia " as part of a new millennium Great Game to control the world 's resources .
In the 1990s , Russia extended its technology to the West , but its offers were spurned and then withdrawn after the US attacked Iraq .
Nonetheless , ExxonMobil nearly got a $ 25 billion stake in Yukos Oil that only unraveled after its chief executive Mikhail Khodorkovsky 's arrest and conviction quashed the deal .
Had it gone through , Exxon would have had access to the world 's largest resource of abiotic - trained deep drilling experts , now unavailable to their scientists and the West .
It now comes down to this .
Western technology is built around fossil fuel development .
If the future is abiotic , as Engdahl and Russian scientists believe , " Moscow holds a massive energy trump card . "
It also faces a hostile US and possible new Cold War confrontation for its advantage and unwillingness to be accommodative the way Boris Yeltsin was in the 1990s .
If abiotic theory proves false or overrated , however , and orthodox geology is right , then controlling world oil reserves is even more important .
It means peak oil is real , cheap oil is running out , heavier oils are more important , and cornering what 's left will be Priority One for all major world powers .
There you have it - peak oil or vast untapped amounts of the abiotic kind awaiting new technology to access it .
Readers can weigh the evidence , find more on their own , and decide what 's true or false .
In the fullness of time we 'll know , but for now we must rely on our best judgment with plenty of ammunition on both sides of the argument to consider .

Pennsylvania Avenue Freeze - Out : Punished by Perino ?
Eric Brewer
Published : Tuesday February 12 , 2008

Print This Email This
The following is the second White House report from Eric Brewer , who will periodically attend White House press briefings for Raw Story .
Brewer is also a contributor at BTC News .
He was the first person to ask about the Downing Street memo at a White House briefing .
I did n't think the question I asked Tony Fratto on January 17 was that outrageous .
It merely questioned the huge discrepancy between President Bush 's year - ago description of the Iraqi government 's domestic security " plan , " and Iraqi officals ' recent statements about that " plan . "
But evidently someone in the White House did n't like the question , because since that date , Press Secretary Dana Perino has repeatedly ignored my attempts to ask questions during the daily briefings .
On January 23 , I sat in the fourth row of the briefing room and held my hand up throughout the 22 - minute session .
Dana called on everyone else , including one other reporter in the fourth row , but she did not call on me .
On February 5 , I snagged a seat in the third row ( all of the seats in the room are reserved for mainstream press organizations , but sometimes there are no - shows ) and sat to the immediate left of Les Kinsolving .
When Dana finished answering Les 's two questions , she skipped over my raised hand and went to two other reporters seated to my left .
Then she took two more questions from the front row before ending the abnormally brief 13 - minute briefing .
I still had my hand up .
I tried again today , but , as Keats would put it , la belle dame sans merci was unyielding .
This kind of thing has happened before , of course .
Back when I was reporting from the White House for BTC News , Scott McClellan pulled the same stunt a number of times .
And recently , Talking Points Memo was taken off the Department of Justice 's email list after it did 682 posts on the U.S. Attorneys scandal .
The question I was n't able to ask today : " The U.S. military conducted 19 focus groups throughout Iraq last November and found that Iraqis from every ethnic and sectarian group are virtually unanimous in the belief that the U.S. invasion is the root cause of the sectarian violence in Iraq , and that the departure of the U.S. military is the key to national reconciliation .
Has the President seen the military 's report on these focus groups ? "
I decided to ask that question , because when Bush was talking about the " surge " in his last State of the Union address , he made the following statement : " The Iraqi people quickly realized that something dramatic had happened .
Those who had worried that America was preparing to abandon them instead saw tens of thousands of American forces flowing into their country . "
If the President is going to talk about what the Iraqi people are thinking , he should have to answer questions about what the Iraqi people are thinking .
Answer my question , Dana .
Sick of standing in line at airports ?
Too bad , that 's not going to change , but the Transportation Security Administration is exploring a way to take advantage of your waiting with a virtual patdown , reports the magazine National Defense .
Transportation Security Laboratory Director Susan Hallowell would like to see the day when airline passengers no longer have to take their shoes off after standing in a long line at airport security checkpoints .
To that end , she would like to combine the line and an array of sensors into what she calls a “ tunnel of truth . ”
The concept — with the somewhat Orwellian name — would have passengers stand on a conveyor belt moving under an archway as various sensors scan them for weapons , bombs or other prohibited items .
By the time they step out of the tunnel , they have been thoroughly checked out , she said at a homeland security science and technology conference sponsored by the National Defense Industrial Association .
“ You ’re in line anyway … why not enclose that in a little glass thing and do your analysis there ? ” she asked .
The lab has given a grant to Penn State University to study the concept , she added .
Stewart : After Rove will Fox hire a felon next ?
David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Wednesday February 6 , 2008

Print This Email This After Fox News anchor Chris Wallace boasted of the cable network 's latest coup -- securing paid political commentary from Karl Rove -- in a Super Tuesday interview on the Daily Show , host Jon Stewart , demonstrating his trademark wit , quickly jumped on the absurdity of such a hire .
Before the fireworks began , Wallace noted that even though there have never before been so many primaries on the same day , they are still unlikely to determine the outcome .
This is especially true on the Democratic side , where a system of proportional representation means that a candidate who wins a state with 55 % of the vote is likely to gain only a few more delegates than the loser with 45 % .
" The Republicans are very orderly , things like winner take all , " Wallace explained .
" The Democrats like it to be kind of messy and free - flowing . "
But Wallace 's real purpose for coming on the show was to boast about his network .
" We have got Karl Rove in his debut as a Fox News contributor , " Wallace stated proudly , offering to deliver a message to Rove from Stewart or his audience .
Stewart did not immediately rise to the challenge , instead asking Wallace slyly , " Do you think that now that he 's there Fox will , you know , get access to this administration ? "
But when asked again to send a message to Rove , Stewart offered , " Does lying feel bad ? "
Stewart further prompted Wallace , " When he 's talking about stuff ... lean in every now and again and just go like , ' Lying .
Does a little piece of you die inside when you do it ? ' "
And he speculated that it might be difficult for Wallace to have Rove right there and not feel an urge to ask him about his role in the Plame outing or about the 935 lies that got us into war in Iraq .
When Wallace insisted stoutly that he would have no problem limiting his interactions with Rove to requests for election commentary , Stewart upped the ante .
" Let me ask you a question .
Can you hire a felon ?
Or is that -- no , that 's Libby .
... Could Libby get a job there too ? "
A visibly squirming Wallace responded by saying , " The idea of coming on here Super Tuesday to promote Fox News seemed like such a good idea about ten minutes ago . "
Stewart finally asked Wallace about the Democrats boycotting Fox News and Wallace perked up , announcing that Hillary Clinton has accepted an invitation to debate on Fox News next Monday and that " the dam has broken now that John Edwards is no longer in the contest . "
However , as of Wednesday morning , it had not yet become clear whether Barack Obama would join her .

Haskell の >>= とか >>，F# の |>， JavaScript や Ruby のメソッドチェイン， C# の Extension Methods を使ってみて思ったのが，チェイン時にレシーバの型と戻り値の型を変えられるのは実はとてもありがたいということです． 動的型付け言語であ る JavaScript や
Ruby であれば，元から戻り値の型は実行時にころころ変えられるので，何を今更，な話でしょう． じゃあ静的型付け言語であ る
Haskell ， F#， C# ではどうかというと，パイプライン後段のメソッドルックアップが，パイプライン前段のメソッドルックアップに依存しているというのがとても便利です．パイプライン前段のメソッドルックアップをちょっと変えてやると，そこよりあとの段については コンパイラ が最適なメソッドを選び直してくれるのです．LINQ to Object の ソースコード が， 「 より優先度の高いルックアップルールを using で導入するだけで 」 ，LINQ to SQL になるってのはそういうことですよね ．
上 の 「 ここまで読んだ」のところの型が，Even なのか SpecializedEven なのか書かない方がむしろ良くね？ というわけです．特定の型を強制したければ，CastTo< T> という処理でも作って明示すればよいでしょう．
変数代入に紛れてこっそりアップキャストされると，メソッドルックアップルールを活用したメソッド選択/差し替えの結果が変わってしまいます．
ところ変わればプログラマの意図も変わる
以上のようなことを思ったのは実は昨年暮れだったりするのですが，あとはまあ『ベイダー日記
2008-02-21』を読んでまた漠然と思い出したり，最近流行のローカル変数のアップキャスト議論で思い出したり．
わかりきったとこならvarでもいぃんとちゃうの?
これについても同意っちゃー同意なんですけど、
僕がこだわるのがコンパイラの型推論が
プログラマの意図と一致しないことがあるなー、と。 var children = new List < Child >( ) ; 僕はおそらく、このテの( 省略目的の)varは使わない気がします。
children はList<T>でなくてはならないとは思っていない、
Childの集合でありさえすればえぇのや、 ICollection < Child > children = new List < Child >( ) ; なのよね僕のキモチ的には。
この辺は仮名漢字変換を単文節でぶつ切り変換するのが好きか，長文で一気に変換するのが好きかみたいなもので，もはや好みの問題かなぁという気もします．私も昔はぶつ切り変換的にコーディングしていましたが，最近は逆です．型を介してシンプルなロジックを連結するスタイルに変わりました．シンプルなロジックの連結だけを書いておけば，最後にコンパイラが型を介して一気に巨大なロジックを組み立ててくれるよ教に宗旨替えです．
半端なローカル変数や private メソッドを排すことで，思考速度とロジックの結合速度が一致してくる感覚は楽しいですね．「この流れで行けばうまく組み立て挙げられる」と確信しているときに，いちいち型を書いたりしないですよと．型のミスマッチはコンパイル時に検証されるので，意図とコードがズレていないかのみが重要です．その意味では，ぶつ切り変換的なコーディングも，込めている意図があってそれとはズレていないよというだけの話なんでしょうけどね．スタイルの違いなので，まあ好きな方を使えばよいのでしょう．
私はというと，長文変換的なコーディングをするようになって，関数テンプレートの型推論*1やラムダ式の型推論，メソッドオーバーロードのルックアップがいかに重要かというのが納得できました．これに関しては，実際に自分でやってみるまで，いくら文章で説明されても実感が伴った理解になっていなかったと断言できます．
今の自分が過去の自分に 「 var や let で定義した変数は，型変換という副作用を持たないが故に，処理と処理の連結器のように使うことができるのです」なんて言ったとしても，今の自分が意図しているところはなかなか伝わらないんですよね，多分．とまあ多分にキモチ的な問題なんだと思います．
TEHRAN , Iran , Feb. 16 , 2008  --
A new movie in Iran depicts the life of Jesus from an Islamic perspective .
" The Messiah , " which some consider as Iran 's answer to Mel Gibson 's " Passion of the Christ , " won an award at Rome 's Religion Today Film Festival for generating interfaith dialogue .
The movie will be adapted into a television series to be shown on Iranian TV later this year .
Filmmaker Nader Talebzadeh spoke to ABC's Lara Setrakian in Tehran .
LS : Why did you feel a movie showing Islam 's take on Jesus needed to be made ?
NT : I 've been witnessing what 's been going on in Iran for the past 28 years ; I 've been living here after I lived a decade in America .
Everybody knows Jesus , so why not make a film about something everyone relates to ?
And made in Iran .
LS : What are the key differences between Jesus through Islam 's eyes and Jesus through the traditional Christian perspective ?
NT : We are talking about the same beautiful man , the same beautiful prophet , the same divine person sent from heaven .
In the Koran , it emphasizes maybe three main points : about the birth , about the fact that he was not the son of God , and then , that he was not crucified .
The rest is [ the same ] Jesus ... the sermons , and the miracles , and the political situation .
LS : So , when it comes to Jesus , the message and the reverence are there .
NT : Yes .
LS : But the virgin birth , the crucifixion ...
NT : The virgin birth was the same .
The difference in the Koran , God says Jesus was saved .
Instead of having him hung and crucified , the person who betrayed Jesus was crucified .
This is how the Koran sees it , through the Gospel of Barnabas .
LS : So , you gave the alternate ending .
NT : Yes , two endings .
I thought , the Christians , when they see it , it 'll be important for them .
[ In the Koran ]
God says , emphatically , he was not crucified .
Somebody was crucified in his stead .
In the Gospel of Barnabas , there are explications of this .
The majority of [ Muslims ] say the one who betrayed Jesus [ was crucified ] .
LS : There 's plenty of news today about Christians being persecuted , or even killed , today , in Muslim countries .
So , where does the Muslim reverence for Christians go off - track ?
NT : It does n't go off - track .
The Muslim reverence is very high for Jesus and Mary .
This is the misunderstanding in the West — especially in America .
LS : So , then , why in your mind do Muslims , in some places , kill Christians ?
NT : Well , those are not Muslims .
They 're murderers .
First and foremost , they 're murderers , and they dress as Muslims .
Today , we have that problem .
There is an evil strain in those people .
They 're , first , evil , and then they find a religion to address that evil , or to explain it , or as an excuse .
But that 's a minority that is aggrandized , and it 's elaborated — it 's constant .
So , when you hear the word " Islam , " you get a shock .
Every time you hear " Islam , " you get a little shock .
What we lack is communication .
LS : While production on this movie was happening , Mel Gibson 's " Passion of the Christ " came out .
What did you learn from watching that film ?
NT : We were almost finished filming when Mel Gibson started shooting .
I saw the film , and it's the first time the Gospel of John has ever been depicted .
It was nice .
But it was the wrong story .
In my film , I respect that common belief with all the good intentions the Christians have ... according to what Islam says .
Yet , Jesus , at the night of the last supper , ascends to heaven [ without being crucified ] .
A beautiful man , a beautiful prophet .
Why should he be bloodied that way ?
LS : What kind of response have you gotten from Christians ?
What kind of feedback and interchange has there been since the movie was released ?
NT : Many thought this film is a good step for serious inter-religious dialogue .
Many of them liked it — seeing the Koran - based ending .
And I was very happy that the practicing Christians were very happy with the film .
I have never found one case among practicing Christians who are offended [ by the movie ] .
American Christians , I respect them very much .
I think these Christians , the born - again Christians , especially , are a very interesting group that Iran is not aware of , because a whole generation of Iranians have n't been able to travel to America .
And those who do move to America , stay in America .
So , how to create serious communication , not at the political , but at the religious level ?
I thought this would be a shortcut .
LS : Any plans for a movie that would help the dialogue between Muslims and Jews ?
NT : This film is about Jesus , who is the last Jewish prophet .
The audience has to realize that Iranians have been living with Jews and Christians for centuries .
Jews were saved by Iranian kings .
This was always their home , and it still is their home .
Also , the first Christian church was built in Iran .
The first Christian tribe that became Christian , the first tribe — was the Armenians .
Armenians were part of the Persian Empire ... they found comfort living with the Iranians .
LS : What is your hope for the movie ?
NT : The film is an excuse to sit down and talk .
Iran is so consistently demonized .
Once an American visits Iran , they know it 's a different story .
So , how do we export our thinking ?
It 's the movies .
This is a film for students and for practicing Christians , for people to become curious , and go investigate more .
My hope for the movie was , and is , and will be , to make people think about how God sees the prophets , how God talks about Jesus in the Koran .
What was the main message of Jesus ?
And what was censored out of history ?
Part of the message of Jesus was censored out , which was the coming of the next prophets .
If you listen to what Jesus said , Jesus talked about the Prophet Mohammad , many , many times .
And it was eliminated in the Gospels and the Bibles that [ made it through ] history .
In 325 , the Council of Nice was out to destroy all the other Gospels .
One of those Gospels was the Gospel of Barnabas , which I used in great detail .
LS : And what did that say that was left out ?
NT : It had a lot of sermons of Jesus that you do not see in the Bible ; miracles , and at least a hundred references to the Prophet Mohammad , about his coming .
It 's one of the biggest censorships of history .
So , I thought somebody should say this , and then others might disagree , say , " Ahhh , this could not be !
This is blasphemy ! "
But it 's OK — this is the 21st century .
It 's time for information .
It 's time for communication .
They can go check it out .
LS : Anything else you felt while making the film ?
NT : I thought about Americans when I was shooting this ...
I was thinking that I have very good memories of the '90s , living in Virginia , remembrances of kindness .
The misunderstanding of the past three decades really burns my heart .
There 's so much misunderstanding about Islam today .
And one of those key missing links , that would bind the chain together , is Jesus Christ .
I thought , we should work on talking through something that 's much more dear to us than other things .
I thought that , through art , you could do a lot more than with the politics .

Sony has quite the history of crippling excellent , beautiful hardware with horrible , useless software .
The company 's UX UMPC bluescreened on us the first time we turned it on , and crashed the first time we tried to shut it down thanks to all the bloatware on it , while a Laptop Mag review says their Vaio TZ ran " as if it were broken " before they managed to wipe it clean .
Lucky for us , it appears
Sony is finally seeing the error of its ways , but instead of removing the crapware altogether , Sony has the nerve to offer a $ 50 " Fresh Start " option , which " scrubs " the machine clean before shipping it your way .
At the moment you can only configure the TZ2000 crapware - free , but hopefully Sony will be rolling out the choice to the rest of its laptops soon .
Or here 's an idea , Sony : stop trying to milk profits and start giving consumers laptops that actually work out of the box .
[ Thanks , Camron T]
In case you missed it , it looks like Sony had a change of heart about Fresh Start .
( What , already ? )

Before beginning San Francisco 's inaugural Cardboard Tube Fighting Championship on Sunday afternoon , the event 's organizer , Robert Easley , instructed all participants to sign a waiver form .
" Folks !
Need you to sign this paper just in case your head gets cut off , " the 27 - year - old Easley of San Francisco told a group gathered at Justin Herman Plaza who in turn laughed .
" Seriously .
That 's actually in the release form . "
Risks , according to the form , " include but are not limited to the loss of eye(s ) , decapitation , impalement , bloody lips , bruises , welts , paralysis and / or death . "
With that , about 75 computer programmers , elementary school - age children and bored passers - by , among others , signed up to spend the next two hours kicking the cardboard out of each other .
In the end , no one was decapitated , and Aline Xayasouk , a petite 20 - year - old Berkeley woman dressed up as a piece of sushi , was declared cardboard fighting champion .
The object of the game was simple : Easley handed participants yardlong cylinders of cardboard .
They dueled in pairs until one of the tubes broke .
Rules included no stabbing , no hitting in the face and no blocking with anything other than cardboard .
" People take life too seriously , " said Easley 's friend Julian Cash , who helped organize the event to remedy that problem .
" If you 're not having fun , it damages your soul . "
The participants did what they could to damage one another 's cardboard armor .
Some dressed as robots , some as knights .
Others just showed up in duct - tape jobs .
" I'm here to beat the cardboard hell out of young children , " said Sol Vazquez , a 29 - year - old businessman from San Bruno dressed as " Count Sexula . "
His armor included a velvet cape , satin rose necklace , mixed martial arts gloves , afro wig and an intimidating plastic crotch cup .
Within 45 seconds , Count Sexula was also the tournament 's first loser , after holding up an impotent tube destroyed by a ninja .
The cardboard fights were divided into about three rounds and held in the brick and concrete area of the plaza .
Fights lasting longer than 45 seconds were usually due to wimpy defensive tactics and were frowned upon by several hundred spectators .
The crowd demanded action .
The loudest cheers went to children like 8 - year - old Grayson Gerhard of Bernal Heights , who defeated opponents nearly three times his size by whaling away with passion .
Ominous clouds formed overhead as the competition closed in on the final two participants , " Sushi " ( Xayasouk ) and " The Knight " ( 29 - year - old Rachel McConnell ) , whose cardboard was adorned with the Fruit of the Loom logo .
The sudden - death round lasted nearly 10 minutes , and the crowd overwhelmingly supported Sushi .
They shouted " Sake to her ! " and " Open up a can of wasabi on her ! "
As the saying goes , defense wins championships , and Sushi was declared winner with the help of a cutout cardboard shield .
In honor of her victory , Easley awarded Sushi the cardboard - made Heaven 's Will trophy " valued at well over a dollar . "
Before the crowd dispersed , Easley asked all to sign one more form .
" I 've got a petition here to make cardboard tube fighting an Olympic sport , " said Easley .

Group Renews Call for Investigation and Oversight
WASHINGTON - The American Civil Liberties Union today sharply condemned the secret endorsement by the Justice Department of the most barbaric interrogation practices ever used by the CIA .
The secret memos justifying the use of torture are at odds with public assurances by both the White House and the Justice Department that " abhorrent " torture methods would not be used on terror suspects .
The memos also appear to be a cynical attempt to shield interrogators from criminal liability and to perpetuate the administration 's unlawful interrogation practices .
One legal opinion , which gave explicit authorization to abuse terror suspects with a disturbing mix of physical and psychological interrogation practices including waterboarding , was approved in 2005 and reported by the New York Times today .
" Although President Bush himself has said , ‘ we do not torture , ' the Justice Department 's torture opinions tell a very different — and shameful — story , " said Anthony D. Romero , ACLU Executive Director .
" After experiencing nearly three years of a broken Justice Department under an attorney general with one of the worst civil liberties legacies in our nation 's history , it is long overdue for the Bush administration to come clean on its record on torture .
This despicable episode highlights the need for renewed scrutiny and accountability . "
In light of the Justice Department 's torture memos , the ACLU is requesting :
The appointment of an independent special counsel to investigate what appears to be an extensive , long - term pattern of misusing Justice Department authority to insulate individuals from criminal prosecution for torture and abuse , and , if appropriate , the prosecution of any person who violated federal laws protecting detainees against torture and abuse and in violation of U.S. obligations under international law .
The public release of all Justice Department documents that permit the use of any interrogation or detention practices that are not authorized by the Army Field Manual on Interrogations , as well as any documents interpreting or analyzing any legal prohibitions on torture or cruel , inhuman , and degrading treatment .
Nothing less than a complete repudiation by Attorney General - designate Michael Mukasey of the Justice Department 's legal opinions on torture at his confirmation hearings before the Senate .
" The Justice Department 's torture memos reveal , once again , a brazen willingness to flout the rule of law .
Lip - service and empty gestures are not enough to protect the Constitution , " said Caroline Fredrickson , Director of the ACLU Washington Legislative Office .
" Congress must call for nothing less than a complete disavowal of these abhorrent practices from the next attorney general before confirmation .
Congress must not only end the administration 's torture practices once and for all , but it must vigorously engage in oversight and restore our Constitution and American values . "

( CNN ) -- Even as voters in South Carolina headed to the polls Saturday to deliver a beat down to Sen.
Hillary Clinton for Sen. Barack Obama , former President Bill Clinton continued to stoke the racial fire , hoping an ember would ignite his wife 's campaign and lead it to victory .
Roland S. Martin : Former President Bill Clinton 's race - baiting failed in South Carolina .
As reported on Jake Tapper 's ABCNews.com blog , at a stop in Columbia , South Carolina , the former president was asked to respond to Obama 's comment that it " took two people to beat him . "
Instead of answering the question , he said , " Jesse Jackson won South Carolina in ' 84 and ' 88 .
Jackson ran a good campaign .
And Obama ran a good campaign here . "
Tapper said no one asked about Jackson .
His name never came up .
Yet Clinton had no problem invoking it .
Is n't the reason obvious ?
The ridiculously called first black president did n't mention his win in 1992 .
Or that of Vice President Al Gore in 2000 , or even then - Sen. John Edwards ' win in 2004 .
He decided to bypass all of these gents and link Obama with Jackson , who is beloved in black America but stirs hatred among many whites .
I 'm sure some of you are saying , " Oh , Roland .
Stop reading race into everything ! "
But what we 've all learned over the years is that race is a hot commodity , and has been used effectively by all kinds of candidates to stir people up along racial lines .
Since Richard Nixon implemented the " Southern strategy " in 1968 , which was intended to get Southern whites to side with the GOP due to their anger at the Democrats for passing civil rights legislation , it has been a staple of American politics , especially down South .
It has largely been used by the Republicans over the years , and Democrats have always blasted it as race - baiting .
So the idea that a former president -- a beloved Democrat , especially among African - Americans -- would do such a thing to help his wife was considered nonsense .
During CNN 's coverage Saturday night of the South Carolina Democratic primary , commentator Carl Bernstein called it " unthinkable . "
But it really is n't .
Clinton has used race when it suited him over the years .
( Check out Rep. Jesse Jackson 's book , " A More Perfect Union , " where it 's covered over six pages . )
And a top adviser to the campaign of Sen. Hillary Clinton admitted to Ron Fournier of The Associated Press in a report published Friday that it was the campaign 's intent to turn Obama , who has deftly avoided the race issue , into " the black candidate . "
Based on the results in South Carolina , it backfired badly .
The jury is still out as to whether it hurts him in the nearly two dozen - state February 5 contest , but what the voters in South Carolina made clear is that they wo n't reward candidates who play the race card .
And basking in the glow of a 28 - point win , and winning more votes than Clinton and Edwards combined , Obama stressed his inclusive campaign during his victory speech .
" What we 've seen in these last weeks is that we 're also up against forces that are not the fault of any one campaign , but feed the habits that prevent us from being who we want to be as a nation , " he said .
" It 's the politics that uses religion as a wedge , and patriotism as a bludgeon .
A politics that tells us that we have to think , act , and even vote within the confines of the categories that supposedly define us .
The assumption that young people are apathetic .
The assumption that Republicans wo n't cross over .
The assumption that the wealthy care nothing for the poor , and that the poor do n't vote .
The assumption that African - Americans can't support the white candidate ; whites can't support the African - American candidate ; blacks and Latinos can't come together .
" But we are here tonight to say that this is not the America we believe in .
I did not travel around this state over the last year and see a white South Carolina or a black South Carolina .
I saw South Carolina .
I saw crumbling schools that are stealing the future of black children and white children .
I saw shuttered mills and homes for sale that once belonged to Americans from all walks of life , and men and women of every color and creed who serve together , and fight together , and bleed together under the same proud flag .
I saw what America is , and I believe in what this country can be . "
Sure , Obama received one - fourth of the white vote , and won an overwhelming percentage of the black vote .
But when you look at those white voters , he really scored well among those 18 - 29 .
This is the generation that grew up with hip - hop , who are less likely to be hung up about race .
They do n't respond to racial appeals because they did n't know Jim Crow .
They do n't have any understanding of busing .
If you say white flight they 'll look at you with a quizzical look .
Bottom line : America has tired of playing the race game , and is increasingly looking for people who see others for who they are , and not their little niche .
Obama is n't even naïve to believe that racism will dissipate if he 's president .
He told me that after his win in Iowa .
But at least last night , in the state where the first shot was fired nearly 150 years to kick off the Civil War , the voters of South Carolina told their fellow southerner , Bill Clinton , and his wife , Sen. Clinton , that the tired political games of the past should remain there .
Then , and only then , can we recognize one another as what we truly are : Americans .

Regarding his political beliefs as " very liberal " ... dont think its sarcasm ... probably 2 things that we may or may not prove at a later point :
1 ) smoking some good weed / marijuana or snorting the white powder
2 ) using services of 3rd parties entertainers a la Eliot Spitzer ... client number 1 ?
Maybe some customers can put a message on his face book page so he can correct his misguided views regarding the abscence of backlash ....
Lets see how long that page of his stays up .

Jokes aside , I would * really * appreciate if anyone can post links to articles or statements by anyone at Bell that deal with the issue of having to throttle to prevent a few downloaders from messing with the rest of the users .
This is a very critical point to bring to the competition bureau since it gives them lots of meat to chew on with regards to Bell 's ads that say that users of DSL can download Videos and Music without impacting other users in the neighbouhood .

Your recent article on internet traffic management completely missed the point about Bell Canada 's decision to interfere with the services it provides to third party DSL wholesalers .
There is no evidence that Bell 's decision to throttle service provided to wholesalers has anything to do with preserving capacity on Bell 's network .
Rather , it 's a fairly simple case where Bell has used its position as a monopoly provider of last mile DSL service to prevent any DSL ISP from offering better service than Bell 's retail DSL ISP arm ( Sympatico ) chooses to offer .
While there is no evidence of Bell deliberately crippling third party DSL ISPs , the definite * effect * of Bell 's policy is to tilt the playing field such that no Bell competitor can offer better service than Sympatico chooses to offer .
Furthermore , Bell 's wholesale throttling effects far more than P2P users .
There are many reports on the dslreports.com Teksavvy forum [ 1 ] of people who have been unable to access work - related electronic resources from home , properly use online banking , use internet telephone services , or play online games , because Bell 's throttling system is so badly implemented that it can't distinguish these normal , low - bandwidth , * and incontrovertibly legal * activities from P2P filesharing .
Calling wholesale ISP throttling a mere capacity issue related to P2P traffic completely whitewashes the issues involved .
Bell Canada is the only one who benefits from this .
Indeed , Bell spokesman Jason Laszlo's appears to be so happy about the way this issue has played out in the media that at 1:14 pm on Saturday , Laszlo 's facebook status page indicated that he was " realizing how little seperates ( sic ) most journalists from lemmings . " [ 2 ]
I strongly urge you to spend some time researching the ultimate effects of Bell 's decision to throttle wholesale ISPs -- start by reading [ 1 ] for a few hours -- and write a follow up piece as soon as possible .

At least five pilots attempting to land at airports in the GTA have complained to Transport Canada about someone on the ground shining a laser at their planes , penetrating the cockpit window and flashing the pilots in the eye .
Transport Canada 's civil aviation reports indicate the incidents are occurring with an increasingly alarming frequency in the GTA and Ontario .
Deborah Baxter , a spokesperson with Transport Canada , says there have been 11 incidents reported in Ontario since last March but expects many more have gone unreported .
The safety risk is obvious .
A laser flashing a pilot 's eye can distract – or even worse – temporarily blind a pilot , or cause long - term damage to their retinas .
In the GTA incidents , the laser pointers seem to be shining from around the city – most recently on Feb. 21 , when a cargo plane and a charter plane both reported a laser had been shone into their cockpits by someone standing near a highway in Vaughan .
A similar incident occurred Jan. 7 , when an Air Canada Jazz pilot was beamed from more than 5 kilometres away from Pearson International Airport .
On May 11 , another passenger jet reported a green light was being shone into the cockpit from the vicinity of Leslie St. and Lawrence Ave. E. in Toronto .
In an October 2007 incident , a police helicopter flying over York Region was targeted while on a routine flight .
In each incident , police were informed and investigations ensued .
But as yet , Transport Canada indicates there have been no arrests of individuals in the GTA , although a 16 - year - old was caught but not charged .
However , Const .
Wayne Patterson of Peel Regional Police , the force responsible for security around Pearson airport , said police could lay a charge of mischief – a criminal offence – against the perpetrators .
Baxter says the risk involved is enough to warrant police involvement .
" Transport Canada is very concerned about the increasing frequency of laser - related incidents , whether they are directed at aircraft , cars , trucks , boats or trains , " Baxter said .
Capt .
Stephen Guetta , a pilot with Air Canada for 20 years , says he can't imagine what kind of person would knowingly try to blind a pilot on a landing approach over a bustling city like Toronto .
He says pilots generally rely on their instruments to navigate a plane toward a runway until they are within sight of the landing strip .
" The threat ( from a laser pointer ) is probably greatest when that airplane is a quarter to a half - mile from the threshold of the runway – when you 're in the final 10 to 12 seconds prior to touchdown , " Guetta said .
" That 's the highest risk , when you 're moving from your instruments to looking outside .
Trying to get your depth of perception .
So you can imagine the danger of blinding a pilot at that point ...
The pilot has very little time to react . "
The long - term damage to a pilot is also troubling .
In cases reported in B.C. and the U.S. , pilots have been grounded permanently and had their wings taken away from them after lasers caused irreparable damage to their retinas .
Steve Lott , a spokesperson for the International Air Transport Association , a Montreal - based group representing 240 airlines , suggests the lasers being shone at airplanes involve more powerful lasers than the average laser pointer used in boardroom presentations .
High - powered telescopic lasers , the type used by astronomers to map out stars and by snipers to pinpoint distant targets , are much more powerful than the average handheld laser and would have a greater reach into the cockpit of a far - off plane .
" The most crucial parts of any flight are the takeoff and landing , " Lott said .

" This is certainly not a game , whether it 's kids playing a game or anything else . "
Charity , do - gooding , philanthropy it ’s all just selfishness masquerading as virtue .
So says the cynic .
In modern times , the theory that each of us , despite occasional appearances of self - sacrificial nobility , is ultimately and invariably looking out for No. 1 got a big boost from Darwin ’s theory of evolution .
By the logic of natural selection , any tendency to act selflessly ought to be snuffed out in the struggle to survive and propagate .
So if someone seems to be behaving as an altruist  say , by giving away a fortune to relieve the sufferings of others  that person is really following the selfish dictates of his own genes .
The evolutionary psychologist Randolph Nesse confessed that he slept badly for many nights after absorbing this supposed discovery , which he called “ one of the most disturbing in the history of science . ”
Before resigning ourselves to a similar spell of disillusioned sleeplessness , it might be instructive to test this theory against a particular case of philanthropy .
In recent years , Bill Gates has channeled billions of his dollars to a foundation devoted to fighting disease and poverty .
The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation may today be the single - most - powerful force in the world for the relief of suffering .
But what , one might ask , is in it for Bill ?
Evolutionary psychologists have come up with four plausible Darwinian reasons for altruism .
First , there is “ kinship selection , ” which is supposed to lurk behind the sacrifices you make for your biological family .
It ’s based on the percentage of genetic overlap .
One biologist , when asked if he would lay down his life for his brother , quipped , no , but he would for two brothers or eight cousins .
Second , there is “ reciprocal altruism , ” which does n’t depend on shared genes .
Here , the basic idea is :
You scratch my back , I ’ll scratch yours .
Reciprocal altruism is seen not just in humans but in some animal species .
Vampire bats , for instance , benefit one another by sharing meals of regurgitated blood .

Quick , how fast is " broadband ? "
If you 're wearing a gray suit and drove a sensible car to work this morning in Washington DC , you probably answered 200 Kbps -- a pokey little number that the FCC 's been using as a baseline for years now .
But even bureaucrats have to get with the times every now and again , and regulators this morning voted to push the government 's official broadband threshold to 768 Kbps -- we 'd say it should really be a full 1 M bps , but why make things simple when you can be the government ?
Between 768 kbps and 1.5 Mbps is now classified as " basic broadband , " and providers are also required to break down both upload and download speeds in specific increments -- a move which should make it harder for companies like Comcast to throttle certain types of connections .
ISPs also have to provide subscriber numbers broken down by census - block level , which should provide graduate students with hours of number - crunching dissertation fun in the future .
The goal is to make sure the data regarding broadband adoption in the US is as accurate as possible -- it 's time to reclaim the crown , people .
Ms Rice 's trip to encourage talks has become a rescue mission
Condoleezza Rice
After meeting US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice in Ramallah , he urged Israel to " halt its aggression so the necessary environment can be created "
Mr Abbas suspended the talks in protest at Israel 's offensive in Gaza , in which more than 110 Palestinians have died .
Ms Rice insisted she still believed a peace deal could be achieved this year .
Before flying to the West Bank , Ms Rice held talks with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in Cairo and other senior government officials .
At the meeting , Ms Rice called for militants in Gaza to halt rocket attacks on Israel , but also said she had told the Israelis to be aware of the effects of their military operations on innocent civilians .
She also stressed US commitment to the Annapolis process launched in November , which envisages an independent Palestinian state existing alongside Israel by the end of 2008 .
' Shores of peace '
After meeting Ms Rice in Ramallah , Mr Abbas said peace and negotiations with Israel were his government 's " strategic choice " , but fell short of announcing a resumption of the process he suspended at the weekend .
No - one can justify the killing actions of the Israeli army over the past few days

" I call on the Israeli government to halt its aggression so the necessary environment can be created to make negotiations succeed , for us and for them , to reach the shores of peace in 2008 , " he told a news conference .
Mr Abbas said at least 20 children had been among the dozens of civilians killed in the Gaza Strip during Israel 's recent five - day offensive , which was launched in an attempt to suppress rocket fire .
" No - one can justify the killing actions of the Israeli army over the past few days , " he added .
" It has always been our conviction that resolving the Israeli - Palestinian conflict cannot be achieved through violence or counter - violence , but through negotiations with terms of reference and international support . "
Ms Rice said she was concerned about the recent violence , but urged the Palestinian Authority to resume talks with Israel .
Rights groups have accused Israel of a disproportionate response
" What we are trying to achieve is not easy ... but I do believe it can be done .
We need very much for everybody to be focused on peace , " she said .
" We look forward to the resumption of those negotiations as soon as possible . "
Ms Rice warned that the " real threat " to peace process were " extremists " such as the Islamist movement Hamas , which seized control of Gaza in June , who she said opposed the establishment of a Palestinian state .
Earlier , Hamas repeated its accusation that the US administration was giving Israel a green light to " massacre " Palestinians in Gaza .
" [ Mr Abbas ] must put an end to the negotiations and not to content himself with suspending them , " Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri said .
Rocket barrage
Ms Rice will meet the Israeli Prime Minister , Ehud Olmert , in Jerusalem later and will hold further talks with Israeli and Palestinian officials on Wednesday before leaving the region .
The violence in Gaza has transformed Ms Rice 's trip to the region .
She had hoped to be nudging Israel and Mr Abbas towards progress in peace talks , but is now attempting a rescue mission to prevent them from completely collapsing .
We cannot afford this kind of extreme Islamic state controlled by Hamas
Tzipi Livni
Israeli Foreign Minister
Israel and the West have shunned Hamas over its refusal to recognise Israel and opposition to the peace process .
Hamas ousted Mr Abbas 's forces from Gaza in June , but he remains in control of Palestinian - administered parts of the West Bank .
Israel has now pulled its troops out of Gaza , but has warned of fresh action to prevent militants firing rockets at populated areas in southern Israel .
" We cannot afford this kind of extreme Islamic state controlled by Hamas , " Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni told foreign diplomats on Tuesday .
Israel evacuated Gaza " not in order to come back , but we might find ourselves in a situation where we have no choice " , she added .
On Tuesday , a rocket hit the nearby Israeli town of Sderot , causing extensive damage .
Israeli forces launched several air and ground strikes on rocket squads and Hamas installations , killing at least two militants .
Three Israelis have died in recent days - a civilian killed by a rocket and two soldiers in the Gaza clashes .
Human rights groups say about half of the approximately 115 Palestinian fatalities have been civilians , and Israel has been accused of a disproportionate military response in breach of the laws of war .
Over two days last week , baseball star Barry Bonds tried to persuade top San Francisco defense lawyer John Keker to represent him in a federal perjury case .
But the talks started faltering when the multimillionaire slugger asked Mr. Keker to handle his case at a steep discount , say several people briefed on the conversations .
Mr. Keker , who charges a $ 900 hourly rate , thought the request was ridiculous , these people say -- especially since Mr. Bonds made nearly $ 60 million in salary between 2005 and 2007 alone .
Mr. Keker also ...
LONDON ( Reuters ) - British spies hired an astrologer during World War Two , although many thought he was a fraud , and even sent him to the United States on a propaganda mission , secret documents released on Tuesday revealed .

British spies hired an astrologer during World War Two , although many thought he was a fraud , and even sent him to the United States on a propaganda mission , secret documents released on Tuesday revealed .
REUTERS / Ali Jarekji
The documents -- the latest in a trickle of British spy agency files being released over the past decade -- provide both a cloak - and - dagger story worthy of a Hollywood script and serious insights into British World War Two spycraft , said the security service ’s official historian , Christopher Andrew .
The files show that many British spy handlers had nothing but contempt for Louis de Wohl , a German - speaking novelist and astrologer who claimed to be descended from Hungarian nobility and called himself “ The Modern Nostradamus . ”
“ I have never liked Louis de Wohl .
He strikes me as a charlatan and an imposter , ” one of his handlers wrote .
“ He at one time exercised some influence upon highly placed British intelligence officers through his star - gazing profession . ”
Another handler called him a “ complete scoundrel ” and another a “ dangerous charlatan and confidence - trick merchant . ”
“ He claims in his books to have traveled widely in the East in Arab disguise and to have often frequented cafés in Berlin in feminine attire , ” wrote another .
Several wrote that they thought he was a former Nazi .
Yet he managed to set himself up in a British government apartment in west London , which he called the Psychological Research Bureau .
There , he read horoscopes for wealthy clients including senior British officials , French resistance commanders and the Romanian ambassador , whom he claimed to have persuaded to resign and defect .
PROPAGANDA TOUR OF U.S .
British spy bosses sent de Wohl on a propaganda tour of America in 1941 , when Britain was at war with Germany but Washington was still officially neutral .
De Wohl gave U.S. newspapers a letter he claimed was from Hitler ’s own astrologer predicting the Nazi leader would “ disappear ” within a year .
U.S. newspapers lapped up his lectures predicting doom for the Nazis , like one to the American Federation of Scientific Astrologers in Cleveland .
“ His propaganda visit to America was considered highly successful , ” one British spy handler wrote in his file , recommending de Wohl be given British nationality .
He was given the rank of captain in the British army , which seems to have annoyed many officials .
One wrote : “ He is not an ornament to His Majesty ’s uniform . ”
For the remainder of the war , the British spy agencies gave him scattered work and decided to keep a careful eye on him .
“ Despite the fact that many people regard him as a charlatan , there are still a great many people eager to take his astrological advice .
He has great gifts as a psychologist and excellent insight into the continental mind , ” a handler wrote .
“ In view of the fact that he is an extremely clever man with multifarious connections and a very singular background , and is guided no doubt solely by self interest , we should exercise as close a surveillance over him as possible . ”
In what appears to be a first , the US House of Representatives now has a Congressman who can code ... in assembly .
That 's right , a Congressman with geek skills .
Democratic Representative Bill Foster won a special election this past Saturday in the 14th Congressional District of Illinois .
This was the district that former Republican Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert held from 1986 - 2007 .
Hastert stepped down in November of 2007 .
Foster , a physicist with a Ph.D. from Harvard , surprised many when he won the district .
After all , it had been a Republican stronghold for more than twenty years .
After being sworn in on Tuesday , Foster has already made his mark , by providing the single vote needed to pass a significant ethics reform bill .
More surprising than the fact that Foster won in a heavily Republican district , more than his public position against telecom immunity , is the fact that Bill Foster is a computer geek .
According to a February article in the Chicago Tribune , Bill Foster has got coding skills :
The Democrat , Bill Foster of Geneva , is a get - out - the - vote geek .
He 's a knock - on - doors nerd who wrote the software program credited with propelling Democratic challenger Patrick Murphy to a narrow victory in 2006 ...
" It was pretty remarkable , " said Nat Binns , a spokesman for Murphy 's campaign .
" He dropped in from nowhere and approached the get - out - the - vote effort as a scientific puzzle .
" He helped us crack the code and figure out where we needed to go and how to do it really efficiently , " Binns said .
" It was brilliant .
We were able to knock on 140,000 doors on Election Day , which was a big part of why we won ( by just 1,518 votes ) . "
Foster 's unofficial title was " campaign physicist . "
Foster worked as a researcher at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory ( Fermilab ) for 22 years .
One of his main projects involved the design of equipment and data analysis software for the lab 's high energy particle collision detector .
Given Foster 's background , his experience in software development , and the research environment in which he worked , it 's almost certain that he worked on Unix systems at some point , too .
I spoke with Tom Bowen , Congressman Foster 's campaign manager , who confirmed that the Representative does indeed have programming skills .
He told me that Congressman Foster has written code in assembly , Fortran , and Visual Basic .
Mr. Bowen also added that during one project , Foster designed integrated circuits that were later used in Fermilab 's particle accelerator .
As for the Congressman 's laptop ?
He owns a Dell that runs Windows .
Oh , well .
He can't be perfect .
What this actually means to tech policy remains unclear .
Computer programming skills do not automatically lead to sound logic or wise positions on important issues .
A quick read through Slashdot user comments easily demonstrates this .
However , it 's likely that someone who has actually used a computer for scientific research will better understand the complex issues at play .
At the very least , we 're not likely to see a Ted Stevens style " Series of Tubes " moment from Congressman Foster .
With any luck , Foster will be assigned to tech and science relevant committees .
Top picks would include the the House Committee on Energy and Commerce , as well as the Subcommittee on Telecommunications and the Internet which is chaired by Net Neutrality cheerleader Edward Markey .
We at Surveillance State predict Foster can expect massive love from the Digg / Slashdot crowd .
Furthermore , while many politicians get invited to talk at Google , it 's likely that Foster could actually correctly answer a few of the company 's notoriously difficult interview questions .
Hat tip : Adam B at DailyKos for first pointing out Foster 's tech credentials .
It 's harder and harder these days to tell a liberal from a conservative -- given the former category 's increasingly blatant hostility toward the First Amendment , and the latter 's prissy new disdain for the Second Amendment -- but it 's still easy to tell a liberal from a libertarian .
Just ask about either Amendment .
If what you get back is a spirited defense of the ideas of this country 's Founding Fathers , what you 've got is a libertarian .
By shameful default , libertarians have become America 's last and only reliable stewards of the Bill of Rights .
But if -- and this usually seems a bit more difficult to most people -- you 'd like to know whether an individual is a libertarian or a conservative , ask about Abraham Lincoln .
Suppose a woman -- with plenty of personal faults herself , let that be stipulated -- desired to leave her husband : partly because he made a regular practice , in order to go out and get drunk , of stealing money she had earned herself by raising chickens or taking in laundry ; and partly because he 'd already demonstrated a proclivity for domestic violence the first time she 'd complained about his stealing .
Now , when he stood in the doorway and beat her to a bloody pulp to keep her home , would we memorialize him as a hero ?
Or would we treat him like a dangerous lunatic who should be locked up , if for no other reason , then for trying to maintain the appearance of a relationship where there was n't a relationship any more ?
What value , we would ask , does he find in continuing to possess her in an involuntary association , when her heart and mind had left him long ago ?
History tells us that Lincoln was a politically ambitious lawyer who eagerly prostituted himself to northern industrialists who were unwilling to pay world prices for their raw materials and who , rather than practice real capitalism , enlisted brute government force -- " sell to us at our price or pay a fine that 'll put you out of business " -- for dealing with uncooperative southern suppliers .
That 's what a tariff 's all about .
In support of this " noble principle " , when southerners demonstrated what amounted to no more than token resistance , Lincoln permitted an internal war to begin that butchered more Americans than all of this country 's foreign wars -- before or afterward -- rolled into one .
Lincoln saw the introduction of total war on the American continent -- indiscriminate mass slaughter and destruction without regard to age , gender , or combat status of the victims -- and oversaw the systematic shelling and burning of entire cities for strategic and tactical purposes .
For the same purposes , Lincoln declared , rather late in the war , that black slaves were now free in the south -- where he had no effective jurisdiction -- while declaring at the same time , somewhat more quietly but for the record nonetheless , that if maintaining slavery could have won his war for him , he'd have done that , instead .
The fact is , Lincoln did n't abolish slavery at all , he nationalized it , imposing income taxation and military conscription upon what had been a free country before he took over -- income taxation and military conscription to which newly " freed " blacks soon found themselves subjected right alongside newly - enslaved whites .
If the civil war was truly fought against slavery -- a dubious , " politically correct " assertion with no historical evidence to back it up -- then clearly , slavery won .
Lincoln brought secret police to America , along with the traditional midnight " knock on the door " , illegally suspending the Bill of Rights and , like the Latin America dictators he anticipated , " disappearing " thousands in the north whose only crime was that they disagreed with him .
To finance his crimes against humanity , Lincoln allowed the printing of worthless paper money in unprecedented volumes , ultimately plunging America into a long , grim depression -- in the south , it lasted half a century -- he did n't have to live through , himself .
In the end , Lincoln did n't unite this country -- that can't be done by force -- he divided it along lines of an unspeakably ugly hatred and resentment that continue to exist almost a century and a half after they were drawn .
If Lincoln could have been put on trial in Nuremburg for war crimes , he'd have received the same sentence as the highest - ranking Nazis .
If libertarians ran things , they 'd melt all the Lincoln pennies , shred all the Lincoln fives , take a wrecking ball to the Lincoln Memorial , and consider erecting monuments to John Wilkes Booth .
Libertarians know Lincoln as the worst President America has ever had to suffer , with Woodrow Wilson , Franklin Roosevelt , and Lyndon Johnson running a distant second , third , and fourth .
Conservatives , on the other hand , adore Lincoln , publicly admire his methods , and revere him as the best President America ever had .
One wonders : is this because they 'd like to do , all over again , all of the things Lincoln did to the American people ?
Judging from their taste for executions as a substitute for individual self - defense , their penchant for putting people behind bars -- more than any other country in the world , per capita , no matter how poorly it works to reduce crime -- and the bitter distaste they display for Constitutional " technicalities " like the exclusionary rule , which are all that keep America from becoming the world 's largest banana republic , one is well - justified in wondering .
The troubling truth is that , more than anybody else 's , Abraham Lincoln 's career resembles and foreshadows that of V.I. Lenin , who , with somewhat better technology at his disposal , slaughtered millions of innocents -- rather than mere hundreds of thousands -- to enforce an impossibly stupid idea which , in the end , like forced association , was proven by history to be a resounding failure .
Abraham Lincoln was America 's Lenin , and when America has finally absorbed that painful but illuminating truth , it will finally have begun to recover from the War between the States .
bzr 1.3 2008-03-20
------------------
Bazaar has become part of the GNU project < http:// www.gnu. org >
Many operations that act on history , including ``log`` and ``annotate`` are now
substantially faster .
Several bugs have been fixed and several new options and
features have been added .
TESTING :
* Avoid spurious failure of ``TestVersion .
test_version` ` matching
directory names .
( #202778 , Martin Pool )
bzr 1.3rc1 2008-03-16
------- -------
-------
NOTES WHEN UPGRADING :
* The backup directory created by ``upgrade`` is now called
` `backup .
bzr`` , not ``.bzr.backup`` . ( Martin Albisetti )
CHANGES :
* A new repository format ' development ' has been added .
This format will
represent the latest ' in - progress ' format that the bzr developers are
interested in getting early - adopter testing and feedback on .
` `doc / developers / development - repo.txt` ` has detailed information .
( Robert Collins )
* BZR_LOG environment variable controls location of . bzr.log trace file .
User can suppress writing messages to . bzr.log by using ' / dev/null '
filename ( on Linux ) or ' NUL ' ( on Windows ) .
If BZR_LOG variable
is not defined but BZR_HOME is defined then default location
for .bzr.log trace file is ``$ BZR_ HOME /.bzr. log`` .
( Alexander Belchenko )
* ``launchpad`` builtin plugin now shipped as separate part in standalone
bzr.exe , installed to ``C : \Program Files \Bazaar\ plugins` ` directory ,
and standalone installer allows user to skip installation of this plugin .
( Alexander Belchenko )
* Restore auto-detection of plink.exe on Windows .
( Dmitry Vasiliev )
* Version number is now shown as " 1.2 " or " 1.2 pr2 " , without zeroed or
missing final fields .
( Martin Pool )
FEATURES :
* ``branch`` and ``checkout`` can hard - link working tree files , which is
faster and saves space .
( Aaron Bentley )
* ``bzr send`` will now also look at the ``child_submit_to`` setting in
the submit branch to determine the email address to send to .
( Jelmer Vernooij )
IMPROVEMENTS :
* BzrBranch .
_lefthand_ history is faster on pack repos .
( Aaron Bentley )
* Branch6 . generate_ revision_ history is faster .
( Aaron Bentley )
* Directory services can now be registered , allowing special URLs to be
dereferenced into real URLs .
This is a generalization and cleanup of
the lp : transport lookup .
( Aaron Bentley )
* Merge directives that are automatically attached to emails have nicer
filenames , based on branch - nick + revno .
( Aaron Bentley )
* ``push`` has a ``-- revision`` option , to specify what revision to push up
to .
( Daniel Watkins )
* Significantly reducing execution time and network traffic for trivial
case of running ``bzr missing`` command for two identical branches .
( Alexander Belchenko )
* Speed up operations that look at the revision graph ( such as ' bzr log ' ) .
` `KnitPackReposi tor.get_ revision_ graph`` uses ``Graph .
iter_ancestry` ` to
extract the revision history .
This allows filtering ghosts while
stepping instead of needing to peek ahead .
( John Arbash Meinel )
* The ``hooks`` command lists installed hooks , to assist in debugging .
( Daniel Watkins )
* Updates to how ``annotate`` work .
Should see a measurable improvement in
performance and memory consumption for file with a lot of merges .
Also , correctly handle when a line is introduced by both parents ( it
should be attributed to the first merge which notices this , and not
to all subsequent merges . ) ( John Arbash Meinel )
BUGFIXES :
* Autopacking no longer holds the full set of inventory lines in
memory while copying .
For large repositories , this can amount to
hundreds of MB of ram consumption .
( Ian Clatworthy , John Arbash Meinel )
* Cherrypicking when using ``-- format=merge3 `` now explictly excludes
BASE lines .
( John Arbash Meinel , # 151731 )
* Disable plink 's interactive prompt for password .
( #107593 , Dmitry Vasiliev )
* Encode command line arguments from unicode to user_encoding before
invoking external mail client in `bzr send` command .
( #139318 , Alexander Belchenko )
* Fixed problem connecting to ``bzr + https://`` servers .
( #198793 , John Ferlito )
* Improved error reporting in the Launchpad plugin .
( Daniel Watkins ,
# 196618 )
* Include quick - start - summary .
svg file to python - based installer (s )
for Windows .
( #192924 , Alexander Belchenko )
* lca merge now respects specified files .
( Aaron Bentley )
* Make version - info -- custom imply -- all . ( #195560 , James Westby )
* ``merge -- preview`` now works for merges that add or modify
symlinks ( James Henstridge )
* Redirecting the output from ``bzr merge`` ( when the remembered
location is used ) now works .
( John Arbash Meinel )
* setup.py script explicitly checks for Python version .
( Jari Aalto , Alexander Belchenko , # 200569 )
* UnknownFormatErrors no longer refer to branches regardless of kind of
unknown format .
( Daniel Watkins , # 173980 )
* Upgrade bundled ConfigObj to version 4.5.2 , which properly quotes #
signs , among other small improvements .
( Matt Nordhoff , # 86838 )
* Use correct indices when emitting LCA conflicts .
This fixes IndexError
errors .
( Aaron Bentley , # 196780 )
DOCUMENTATION :
* Explained how to use ``version - info -- custom`` in the User Guide .
( Neil Martinsen - Burrell )
API BREAKS :
* Support for loading plugins from zip files and
` `bzrlib . plugin. load_from_ zip ( ) `` function are deprecated .
( Alexander Belchenko )
TESTING :
* The branch interface tests were invalid for branches using rich - root
repositories because the empty string is not a valid file - id .
( Robert Collins )
INTERNALS :
* ``Graph .
iter_ancestry` ` returns the ancestry of revision ids .
Similar to
` ` Repository . get_revision_ graph ( ) `` except it includes ghosts and you can
stop part - way through .
( John Arbash Meinel )
* ``Graph .
iter_ancestry` ` returns the ancestry of revision ids .
Similar to
` ` Repository . get_revision_ graph ( ) `` except it includes ghosts and you can
stop part - way through .
( John Arbash Meinel )
* New module ``tools / package_ mf . py`` provide custom module finder for
python packages ( improves standard python library 's modulefinder. py )
used by ``setup .
py`` script while building standalone bzr.exe .
( Alexander Belchenko )
* New remote method ``RemoteBzrDir. find_repository V2 `` adding support for
detecting external lookup support on remote repositories .
This method is
now attempted first when lookup up repositories , leading to an extra
round trip on older bzr smart servers .
( Robert Collins )
* Repository formats have a new supported - feature attribute
` `supports_ external_ lookups` ` used to indicate repositories which support
falling back to other repositories when they have partial data .
( Robert Collins )
* ``Repository .
get_revision_ graph_with_ ghosts` ` and
` `bzrlib .
revision .
( common_ ancestor , MultipleRevisio nSources , common_ graph ) ` `
have been deprecated .
( John Arbash Meinel )
* ``Tree. iter_changes` ` is now a public API , replacing the work - in - progress
` `Tree._ iter_changes` ` .
The api is now considered stable and ready for
external users .
( Aaron Bentley )
* The bzrdir format registry now accepts an ``alias`` keyword to
register_ metadir , used to indicate that a format name is an alias for
some other format and thus should not be reported when describing the
format .
( Robert Collins )
When the USPS introduced Forever Stamps -- First Class stamps that are valid forever , regardless of future rate increases -- my friends immediately had a clever idea : invest in them .
Sitting around at a cocktail party , we talked it over -- judging from recent postal rate increases , it sure seemed like buying Forever Stamps and reselling them in the future ( when surely the postal rates will involve selling your organs ) would be a great investment opportunity .
While we did n't bother to actually research it , I think we were all secretly thinking about leaving the party to go stock up on Forever Stamps .
Well , it turns out that Forever Stamps are guaranteed to be a bad investment idea , both because of inflation in the modern era and because of a pesky law that went into effect just before the stamps were announced .
Slate 's Explainer column did the research , even linking to the story of a fellow who recently bought $ 8,000 worth of Forever Stamps ( that 's 19,512 stamps ) .
Anyway ,
The Explainer gives us some data to chew on :
Since 1971 , postal rates have increased more slowly than the actual inflation rate , as measured by the U.S. Consumer Price Index .
So , despite the numerous rate hikes over the last 36 years , stamps have actually been getting cheaper .
The 20 - cent stamp from 1981 , for instance , would be equivalent to 45 cents in today 's dollars — which makes today 's rate 10 percent cheaper than it was 26 years ago .
Should this historical pattern hold , you'd be paying more for today 's forever stamps than you would for any stamp in the future , no matter how high the rate goes .
In fact , this pattern must hold — as a matter of law . (...)
Read the whole article and also check out Lifehacker 's ( retracted ) " Save the new forever postage stamp " article .
Also : this blog post is not intended to give investment advice ( or non-advice ) , and is presented for trivia value only !
So ... got any investment schemes that seemed like a great idea on the surface , but turned out not to be worth it ?
Along with unwashed , yellowing sheets , movie posters are the most popular choice for decorating a college dorm room .
Whether you preferred Luke Skywalker wielding his lightsaber , Vince Vaughn offering you a martini , or Clockwork Orange brandishing his dagger , if you went to college , you probably had a movie character watching over you as you studied , slept and explored your body quietly so that your roommate would n't hear .
Everyone had a Swingers poster .
Everyone had Star Wars posters .
But there are hundreds of movies made every year , and there have been for close to a century .
What happened to all their posters ?
Are they still around ?
Are any of them really stupid and weird ?

Remember back in the good old days , when everyone assumed that mixed martial arts would be nothing but heavily - oiled dudes leaping around and kicking each other in the chest , all for the amusement of secretive Chinese billionaires ?
Now , thanks to the UFC , we know that mixed martial arts fighting is basically a couple of barely - oily guys rolling around on the ground and punching each other , all for the amusement of Joe Rogan .
We guess we 're just sad that mixed martial arts had to grow up .
Kind of a hastily assembled , somewhat metaphorical poster here featuring a car that for some reason is able to express pain .

This poster honestly looks like it took someone five minutes to make .
This is the movie poster equivalent of a kid doing his homework on the school bus .

This Canadian only recently discovered “ This American Life ” , a weekly hour - long radio show produced by Chicago Public Radio ( and available via podcast ) .
I ’d always felt that I got enough American life from the media–who needs more ?
Then a few months ago I listened to episode # 339 , Break - up , and got kind of hooked .
With more than 300 episodes to choose from , I wanted to go back and listen to the cream of the crop .
I spent some time perusing a bunch of sources and assembled a list of the web ’s favourite episodes of the show .
Basically , every time somebody mentioned that they liked an episode , I marked down a vote for it .
In all , I gathered a list of 129 episodes which received at least one vote .
A List in 19 Acts
These 19 episodes got at least five votes , though the first four received considerably more than that .
I gather they ’re considered classics .
Links go to individual episodes , where you can listen via streaming MP3 or buy for 95 American cents .
All descriptions are excerpted from the “ This American Life ” website .
The list skews slightly toward more recent episodes , but not too badly .
Incidentally , if somebody wants to submit this to MetaFilter , I ’d appreciate it .
It ’s not kosher for me to do so , but I know many Mefi readers are also TAL lovers , and I used a couple of MeFi threads as two of my sources .
After the jump , you ’ll find the other 109 episodes which received anywhere from one to four votes , in alphabetical order .
I did n’t link to their show pages , because that would be a major pain .
Just do a quick search on TAL ’s website .

Sun Microsystems ' long - time chip chief David Yen has left the building for an undisclosed role at Juniper Networks .
Yen most recently served as the EVP in charge of Sun Microelectronics .
In the past , he has been responsible for Sun 's storage division , UltraSPARC - based servers and microprocessor efforts .
Sun has tapped Technology Fellow Mike Splain as the new head of the Microelectronics group .
Juniper refused to tell us what role
Yen will hold , saying that it will disclose this information on April 7 .
Apparently , Yen 's departure from Sun is not official until April 4 .
Yen enjoyed a distinguished , almost 20 - year career at Sun , leading the company 's silicon battles against the likes of Intel , IBM and HP .
Recently , however , his track record has been so - so .
Sun , for example , was forced to cancel or delay a number of UltraSPARC projects over the past few years .
In addition , Yen failed to improve Sun 's fortunes in the storage game during his time as head of the division .
We were once told that Yen threatened to leave Sun a couple of years back only to have the company 's top brass offer him a lucrative " feel better " package .
McNealy and Co. feared losing the man who knew where all the UltraSPARC bodies were buried and the inner-workings of such a complex business .
[ Update : Yen denies that the above ever took place .
You 'll find his rebuttal in the comments section . ]
It 's intriguing to postulate about what Juniper might be up to with Yen .
Juniper seems to be on an expansion kick , having entered the Ethernet switch game in Jan .
Yen could work on networking silicon or perhaps some efforts around new types of hardware . ®

I was watching MSNBC this morning and during a segment on the Black Friday shopping frenzy and the throngs of people waiting in line to get into a New Jersey mall , when something caught my eye .
I rewound the video and sure enough , the first two people through the door were wearing protest shirts -- " Impeach Bush " and " Out Of Iraq " .
I do n't know who these brave souls are , but I thought I 'd thank them for waiting in line to get the chance to make their statement and give them props for getting the holidays off to a great start and trying to spread some good will .
We can only hope security did n't tackle , tase or beat them ...

this is so lame .
i'm a proud mac user and as in " proud " i basically mean , i love my machine because it gets done what i need it to do .
plus i never pay extra after the initial ( sometimes expensive ) price of a mac .
i do n't have updates that cost anything , i do n't have norton anti-virus , i do n't have crashes , yadda yadda yadda .
it just does what i need it to do , when i need it .
that does n't make it perfect , it just makes it a cool machine .
i prefer the material mac uses for their technology over any pc-company .
but i have tons of friends that use pcs WAY more than macs .
i tell them they should do themselves a favor and get a mac - because all of them want something in the media - realm ... that 's hardly anything close to spreadsheets , programming , coding , etc etc .
that does n't make them bad people at all , etc etc. i'm a mac user , but i do n't yell at people that they 're stupid .
i'm just a designer that needs this type of machine .

The crackdown is done in the name of counter - terrorism , the report says
It is being done in the name of anti-separatism and counter - terrorism , says a joint report by Human Rights Watch and Human Rights in China .
It is said to be taking place in the western Xinjiang region , where more than half the population is Uighur .
China has denied that it suppresses Islam in Xinjiang .
It says it only wants to stop the forces of separatism , terrorism and religious extremism in the region , which Uighur separatists call East Turkestan .
Detentions and executions
The report accuses China of " opportunistically using the post - 11 September environment to make the outrageous claim that individuals disseminating peaceful religious and cultural messages in Xinjiang are terrorists who have simply changed tactics " .
CHINA'S UIGHURS Ethnically Turkic Muslims , mainly in Xinjiang Made bid for independent state in 1940s Sporadic violence in Xinjiang since 1991 Uighurs worried about Chinese immigration and erosion of traditional culture
The authors of the report say it is based on previously undisclosed Communist Party and Chinese government documents , local regulations , press reports and local interviews .
The report says the systematic repression of religion in Xinjiang was continuing as " a matter of considered state policy " .
Such repression ranges from vetting imams and closing mosques to executions and the detention of thousands of people every year , it claims .
" Religious regulation in Xinjiang is so pervasive that it creates a legal net that can catch just about anyone the authorities want to target , " said Sharon Hom , Executive Director of Human Rights in China .
The report also reveals that almost half the detainees in Xinjiang 's re-education camps are there for engaging in illegal religious activities .
Uighurs make up about eight million of the 19 million people in Xinjiang .
Many of them favour greater autonomy , and China views separatist sentiments as a threat to the state .
The controversial disorder known as Gulf War illness may have been caused by chemicals used in pesticides and anti-nerve gas pills .
In an article published today in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , University of California , San Diego military health researcher Beatrice Golomb reviewed 115 studies on Gulf War illness , also known as GWI .
Approximately one in three veterans of the Persian Gulf War have reported lingering health problems associated with GWI , from neuropathic pain and loss of muscle control to chronic fatigue and forgetfulness .
The root – or roots – of GWI have n't been conclusively determined .
Among the possible causes are exposure to nerve gas , still - radioactive depleted uranium ammunition , an experimental anthrax vaccine and extreme stress .
Golomb 's review focused on a class of chemicals known as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors , or AChEIs .
Acetylcholinesterase is an enzyme that regulates the activity of acetylcholine , a vital neurotransmitter .
Soldiers were exposed to AChEIs in pesticides , in pills given to blunt the effects of nerve gas , and in nerve gas released during the destruction of an Iraqi weapons depot .
Researchers think that AChEI exposure may cause the overexpression of a rare but debilitating version of acetylcholinesterase previously associated with symptoms similar to those of afflicted soldiers .
Again and again , the studies reviewed by Golomb found that soldiers suffering from GWI had been exposed to AChEIs ; the more they 'd ingested
\– especially when taking AChEI - containing pills – the worse their symptoms were likely to be .
" Across studies , significant positive relationships of AChEi-related exposures to illness in GWV outnumber significant negative relationships more than chance would predict , " wrote Golomb .
" The studies show a high consistency , with most showing a significant
( typically strong ) positive association .
Few nonsignificant findings are present and virtually no inverse associations . "
Golomb also noted that the symptoms of GWI are much like those reported by agricultural workers exposed to AChEI - containing pesticides , and follow effects predicted by AChEI tests on brain cells and animals .
Taken together , the evidence – epidemiological , animal , biological – is persuasive enough for Golomb to formally declare a cause - and - effect relationship .
This is n't just important for veterans of the Gulf War , she wrote ; it could also explain the as - yet - undiagnosed afflictions of civilians exposed to AChEIs .

In what has to be one of the weirdest Q&As we 've read in a long time , Google CEO Eric Schmidt tells Portfolio's Russ Mitchell that a Microsoft - Yahoo deal could " break the internet . "
Was he kidding ?
Apparently not .
When Mitchell asked Schmidt to elaborate , he said , " All internet - based systems today are highly interoperable , open systems .
The whole antitrust trial that Microsoft went through was really about it breaking that . "
Of course , Google is n't a position to talk about openness – the company has earned the reputation as one of the most secretive , uncooperative research communities on the planet , leading critics to call for increased transparency .
Globalizing Its Military Power Beijing Moves to Modernize the People 's Liberation Army

Amid debate over how much data companies like Google and Yahoo should gather about people who surf the Web , one new company is drawing attention  and controversy  by boasting that it will collect the most complete information of all .
The company , called Phorm , has created a tool that can track every single online action of a given consumer , based on data from that person ’s Internet service provider .
The trick for Phorm is to gain access to that data , and it is trying to negotiate deals with telephone and cable companies , like AT&T , Verizon and Comcast , that provide broadband service to millions .
Phorm ’s pitch to these companies is that its software can give them a new stream of revenue from advertising .
Using Phorm ’s comprehensive views of individuals , the companies can help advertisers show different ads to people based on their interests .
“ As you browse , we ’re able to categorize all of your Internet actions , ” said Virasb Vahidi , the chief operating officer of Phorm .
“ We actually can see the entire Internet . ”
Artist 's Statement
Well t his is turning out to be a very weird electoral year , is n't it ?
In some ways it ’s been a surprising triumph of participatory democracy over our wonky , rigged electoral system — voters are turning out in record numbers with genuine enthusiasm , primaries like my own home state of Maryland ’s have actually mattered for the first time in my life , all the supergroomed big - haired millionaire white guy candidates have been defeated early ( though unfortunately one of them was the only candidate whose platform I supported ) , and the insurgency of the Obama campaign has wrecked the presumptive inevitability of a Clinton restoration .
It ’s also shaping up to turn into another 2000 - style historic mess without clear rules or precedent .
It ’s cheering to hear so many people saying : “ this is the first time my vote has ever counted ” — but it ’s also , if you think about it , infuriating .
Why should this be ?
Is n’t this , you know , America ?
Are n’t we all citizens ?
How come for decades people in Iowa and New Hampshire have gotten to decide who the rest of us were allowed to vote for ?
It ’s unnatural and insulting even to have to think about Iowa .
Not ever having to think about it is one of the many charms of not living there .
I ’ve never understood by what shadowy process the initial group of uniformly conservative , hawkish , pro-corporate candidates emerges : do the Masons / Illuminati / Trilateral Commission vet them all before giving them permission to declare candidacy ?
Note that only Dennis Kucinich refuses to kowtow to the Guild Navigator .
This is what dooms him to marginality .
( By the way , in doing a google image search to get Dennis Kucinch ’s silhouette right , I learned something shocking : Dennis Kucinich has a hot wife .
Elizabeth Kucinich is a tall , leggy , redheaded dish , twenty - nine years younger than he is .
Why am I always the last to learn about these matters of national importance ? )
I never did come up with quite the right panel to express our very real trepidation and outrage at the unwelcome possibility that the party nomination might come to rest in the hands of “ superdelegates , ” about whom we are all suddenly learning rather a lot .
Ideally this panel it would ’ve illustrated the threat of having all our votes rendered irrelevant by party insiders , but this was just too much fun to draw .
I trust you will all agree with me as to Plasticman ’s choice of candidates .
I do n’t like to say it , but I think Batman would probably vote for McCain .
Next week I ’m out of town , and you get treated to Jim ’s annual birthday cartoon .
Virgin Media in the UK has announced that it is working with the music industry to chase down its file - sharing customers and disconnect them from the internet .
At the same time , it will offer an enhanced service which will see its customers get free Usenet binaries access , untraceable by the music industry .
Anyone familiar with Virgin Media ’s advertising ( previously Telewest / Blueyonder ) will recall their TV commercials over the last couple of years which centered round the ability to download greater and greater amounts of media , faster than ever before .
Their ‘ Best Things in Life Are Free ’ TV campaign , complete with eye - catching computer graphics , with movie and musical themes throughout left the viewer with a clear message : if you want to download music and movies quickly ( for free ) , join us .
Now , in 2008 , the situation has changed dramatically .
Kind of .
According to a report , the ISP has had a change of heart and will be working in collaboration with the British Phonographic Industry ( BPI ) .
Starting with a pilot scheme , the BPI will deviate from its stated policy of not going after individual file - sharers by targeting Virgin Media customers on P2P networks and reporting them to the ISP .
Set to go live during the next few months , and at the behest of the UK music industry , Virgin ’s scheme will see them send warning letters out to customers flagged as file - sharers by the BPI .
Those who do not heed warnings to stop will see Virgin disconnect them from the internet .
The scheme will also be available to movie and TV studios who wish to punish Virgin ’s customers .
Earlier this year the government said that ISPs should find a way to curb unauthorized downloading .
By stepping up with its own plan , Virgin is hoping to side - step government enforced legislation .
A Virgin Media spokesman said : “ We have been in discussions with rights holders organizations about how a voluntary scheme could work .
We are taking this problem seriously and would favor a sensible voluntary solution . ”
So as Virgin Media constantly upgrades its broadband customers to faster and faster connections over the last couple of years ( 4M bit connections became 10 M bit , 10 M bit then became 20 M bit , 20 M bit due to become 40 mb ) , it now agrees to punish the very people it targets when offering these super - fast connections .
However , all might not be lost for the file - sharer at Virgin Media , especially those who want to max - out their new bandwidth offering .
The ISP will be rolling out a new newsgroup service for its subscribers which should be ready in the next couple of months .
Using the Highwinds server banks , the service will offer 7 days retention on the all important binary newsgroups .
A Virgin spokesman said : “ We ’re delighted to be working with Highwinds to build out our newsgroup service .
Our expanded access to newsgroups will give our customers a free news feed to newsgroups with exceptional retention , providing one of the best free newsgroup services in the UK . ”
Not to mention super high speed access to all the movies , music and software anyone could ever need , with no fear that the BPI , RIAA or IFPI can snoop on the transfers .
The Lord does indeed work in mysterious ways .
Update – Armin has an alternate implementation based on some fancy regular expressions combined with String ’s split method .
Its supports most of ERB and avoids all the string mashing I do .
Nice !
Templating engines are the most popular way to generate HTML pages and other web content .
First popularized by PHP and ASP , templating engines allow you to mix code and content .
The templating engine then takes the combined content , extracts the code , runs it , and combines the results with the remaining content to produce the final output .
Since templating engines are generally used to create HTML that is displayed by a browser , they are almost always run on a server .
But now that all modern browsers support the DOM , XML and Ajax , it can be helpful to run a templating engine on the client .
Before continuing , remember that JavaScript templates are often not the right solution .
Alternatives include generating HTML on a server , or if you are using XML , to use XSL on the client or server to generate HTML .
But if you need something simple and light , perhaps to display a JSON result returned by an Ajax request , then JavaScript templates may fit the bill .
Writing the Templating Engine
A quick search on the Internet found a few existing engines , such as JavaScript Templates , Ajax Pages and the Prototype library .
However , I found the first two to be a bit heavyweight while Prototype was a bit to simple ( it only supports the replacement of values , not the execution of arbritrary statements such as for loops ) .
So I decide to roll my own .
Creating a template engine in JavaScript is remarkably easy due to the power of String ’s replace method .
One of its lesser known features is that you specify a function to invoke every time a pattern is matched .
The pattern is replaced by the results of the invoked function .
Using replace , you can write a template compiler in ten lines of code ( and undoubtedly less if you wanted to ) .
The whole templating engine weighs in at 90 lines , including a helper function copied from the Prototype library .
The engine defines two objects – a template object and a parser object .
The template object takes a string that includes mixed code and content , invokes the parser to compile the template , and then evaluates and returns the result .
Using the Templating Engine
To see how this works , I ’ve created a simple example that is online .
If you look at the HTML code , you ’ll see :
function replaceContent ( ) { var colorsArray = [ ' Red ' , ' Green ' , ' Blue ' , ' Orange ' ] var source = ' < p >
Here is a list of <%= this.colors.length %> colors :' + ' < ul >' + ' < % for ( var i=0 ; i< this.colors.length ; i++) { %>' + ' < li><%= this.colors [i ] %></li >' + ' <% } %>' + ' </ul >' + '</p>' var template = new JsTemplate. Template ( source ) var content = template.run ( {colors : colorsArray} ) var element = document.getElementById(' content ') element.innerHTML
= content }
The first thing to notice is that the source variable specifies the mixed code and content .
The syntax is similar to ERB , which is a Ruby templating engine .
The two recognized tags are :
<% %> Run JavaScript code <%= %>
Replace JavaScript code with the result
To create your own tags create a new Parser object with an appropriate regular expression .
The second thing to notice is that the data use by the template engine is specified via a parameter to the run method .
The parameter should be a JavaScript object .
The properties of the object are copied to the template object , thus allowing the template to refer to them via the this keyword .
And that is about it ( I said it was lightweight ! ) .
To source code of the templating engine is here , while the example is here .
Note the code is released under an MIT license , so you can use it however you would like .
Enjoy .

A high school teacher killed a raccoon with a nail gun after discovering the planned subject of a skinning demonstration was alive .
Superintendent Alvin Lievsay said a student 's parent promised to bring in a raccoon for the exercise , but surprised teacher Jerick Hutchinson by bringing the animal in a live trap .
Lievsay said Hutchinson , " who used to work in a slaughter house , " took the animal outside to the back of his truck Friday and shot it with the nail gun .
Lievsay said no students witnessed the raccoon 's death .
" He used the nail gun to , as they say , to dispatch the animal , " Lievsay said .
" It was n't like he held a nail gun against the head of a cute little animal in front of the class . "
Hutchinson used the dead raccoon to demonstrate how to skin the animal and to examine the contents of its stomach .
Lievsay said only one student asked not to attend the skinning .
Lievsay said officials at Huntsville High School later talked with Hutchinson and told him not to kill animals on school grounds .
The superintendent said Hutchinson , one of two agriculture teachers at the school about 30 miles east of Fayetteville , also would provide more detailed lesson plans in the future .
" He does a great job .
The kids love him , " Lievsay said .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - U.S. President George W. Bush got an earful on Thursday about problems and progress in Afghanistan where a war has dragged on for more than six years but been largely eclipsed by Iraq .
President Bush participates in a video teleconference with Afghanistan Provincial Reconstruction Team Leaders and Brigade Combat Commanders , in the Roosevelt Room at the White House , March 13 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Jim Young
In a videoconference , Bush heard from U.S. military and civilian personnel about the challenges ranging from fighting local government and police corruption to persuading farmers to abandon a lucrative poppy drug trade for other crops .
Bush heard tales of all - night tea drinking sessions to coax local residents into cooperating , and of tribesmen crossing mountains to attend government meetings seen as building blocks for the country ’s democracy - in - the - making .
“ I must say , I ’m a little envious , ” Bush said .
“ If I were slightly younger and not employed here , I think it would be a fantastic experience to be on the front lines of helping this young democracy succeed . ”
“ It must be exciting for you ... in some ways romantic , in some ways , you know , confronting danger .
You ’re really making history , and thanks , ” Bush said .
He was told of efforts to reduce support for the Taliban in tribal areas as well as hopeful signs that schools were being built , more health care was reaching remote areas and local government officials were being trained in management .
Critics accuse Bush of focusing on Iraq to the detriment of Afghanistan where the Taliban has persisted in fighting after being ousted from power by the U.S. - led war in 2001 following the September 11 attacks .
NATO SUMMIT
Bush will try to persuade allies at a NATO summit in early April to do more for Afghanistan .
He wants international support to reduce violence , boost the economy and provide social services .
“ We ’re obviously analyzing ways to help our NATO allies to be able to step up , and step up more , ” he said .
Canada has demanded 1,000 more troops from other countries as a condition for remaining in Afghanistan to work near Kandahar where its 2,500 - strong force is fighting the Taliban .
“ We ’re mindful of their request , and we want to help them meet that request , ” Bush said .
NATO has a total of 43,000 troops in Afghanistan .
The United States has 29,000 troops in the country , about half of which are part of NATO , and is sending another 3,200 Marines .
The Afghan mission is the toughest ground war faced by the 59 - year - old alliance and has led to open differences among allies over tactics and troop levels .
Bush sat at the head of a conference table at the White House with Vice President Dick Cheney , Defense Secretary Robert Gates , Deputy Secretary of State John Negroponte and others .
A Reuters correspondent was permitted to observe the White House exchange that took place with U.S. Ambassador to Afghanistan William Wood and U.S. military and civilian personnel in Kabul .
The videoconference was stopped several times when the sound crackled , diagnosed by technicians as a bad microphone at Kabul ’s end , which was immediately swapped out for a new one .
“ You ’re looking beautiful but you ’re not sounding too good , ” said Bush , who was in charge of the remote control , increasing and lowering the volume at will .
Bush was told that if local governments can provide for their people , they will respond by breaking away from tribal law and the Taliban .
One of the American participants in Kabul said there was a saying in Ghazni : “ Taliban begins where the paved road ends . ”
" Shock Therapy " Hits America Where It Hurts

VLAD'S DAILY GLOAT SPECIAL LATE " HAPPY " EDITION !
What a day great , fun today !
This will make you laugh ( unless you are American ) : last year , Bear Stearns , one of the pillars of the mighty American investment banking system , was named to Fortune magazine 's list of America 's " Most Admired " securities company .
It won this distinction three years in a row , 2005 - 2007 .
We can really trust the American free media to tell us the truth , and we can be sure that Bear Stearns did not bribe Fortune for that ranking .
How strange then that today , Bear Stearns is " Most Fucked " securities firm in the entire world .
And most corrupt too , along with the corrupt American Central Bank .
But first I must explain why this blog is late , why I did n't blog today 's " Collapsing American Economy Show " before I left the office earlier : 1 ) . it was too much fun watching the panic develop , so I only wrote half of this blog at the office before stopping because 2 ) .
at office we had a birthday party , drinking some champagne with our colleagues .
My colleagues are laughing and drinking and toasting the America 's funny collapse even now while I finish this blog , they are waiting for me at a bar just in my neighborhood .
In fact they told me to leave the bar and come home to write this and post it finally .
The whole bar was in a merry mood and cheering .
Before I left I said , " Dear Russian Citizens , the American banking system is collapsing !
The empire is finished , !
These American pederasts will not be fucking with our Russia for a long while ! "
Someone ordered B - 52 cocktails for all the bar , and we drank them in celebration of our comrades who shot down many American B52s in Russian victory in Vietnam , it was really a funny time .
SWEET MEMORIES ABOUT TO BE RELIVED AGAIN
So back to the news today , it is obvious even to the typical American 's retarded little mind what the message is : you are fucked , my friends !
But since your media is so bad , I will quote you from the English newspaper The Telegraph to tell the
You have to go back to the banking crisis of the Great Depression to find a moment when the financial system as a whol seemed so close to the precipice . [... ]
" We are now experiencing the first truly major crisis of financial globalisation , " said the Swiss central bank governor Philipp Hildebrand this week .
" Never before have banks seen such destruction of their balance sheets in such a short time .
Moreover , there are signs that the problems are spreading .
The risk premiums on commercial property , consumer credit and corporate loans have risen sharply , " he said .
Debt levels have been much higher than in the Roaring Twenties ; the new - fangled tools of structured credit are more opaque : the $ 415 trillion nexus of derivative contracts is untested .
Nobody knows for sure if the counter - parties are able to deliver on vast IOUs , or whether the construct is built on sand .
What keeps Federal Reserve officials turning at night is fear that the " financial accelerator " will now set off a vicious downward spiral .
There is a risk of " very adverse economic outcomes , " said Fed vice - chair Don Kohn .
Albert Edwards , global strategist at Societe Generale , said the toppling banks are merely a symptom of a deeper rot .
" The banks are not the problem .
Nor even the grotesquely leveraged funds .
The problem is that an economic bubble financed by ridiculously loose monetary policy is unravelling , " he said .
Losers , you 're so fucked you do not even know what is coming !
You think it 's bad now , just because Bear Stearns has a cactus branch in your assholes ?
Ha !
It 's only a small taste , my friends .
Get ready to sell your old clothes and trinkets outside of bus stations like our babushkas used to in the 1990s , because you are fucked now in a way you simply cannot imagine , you are fucked just like you fucked Russia 10 years ago !
Everything about Bear Stearns collapse and bailout is a deja vu of collapse of Yeltsin - era banking system .
Back then in the 1990s , American advisers created Russia 's " market " system , and that ended in a total economic collapse in August of 1998 .
What is happening today in America is just a repeat .
For example , the development this week of the Bear Stearns collapse reminds me so much of the same way Russian banks collapsed under American guidance in the 1990s .
In Russia under Yeltsin , when a bank was close to collapse they always assured the public that everything was fine and they blamed " rumors " for causing problems ; this week , the CEO of Bear Stearns and all the American journalists on Bear Stearns payroll blamed " rumors " and " irrational psychology " for causing a run on Bear Stearns ' money during the week .
The purpose of these lies is that it allows the insiders to cash out their money while the rest of the trusting American fools keep their money in , only to lose it later .
Then after the insiders cash out , comes the supposed " panic " and " sudden " collapse , best to take place on a Friday of course .
The " sudden collapse " and " panic " gives cover for the next even bigger transaction : the connected Bear Stearns banker calls the Central Bank Chief Bernanke , just as Khodorkovsky would call Dubinin or whoever was Central Bank chief then , and naturally Bernanke gives to Bear Stearns as many billions as the CEO asks for , and everyone thinks it 's okay because the billions were necessary in this atmosphere of alleged " sudden panic , " as if Bear Stearns and Bernanke had not been speaking to each other like phone sex addicts every day 24/7 the entire week .

Back then in the 1990s , American advisers created Russia 's " market " system , and that ended in a total economic collapse in August of 1998 .
What is happening today in America is just a repeat .
For example , the development this week of the Bear Stearns collapse reminds me so much of the same way Russian banks collapsed under American guidance in the 1990s .
In Russia under Yeltsin , when a bank was close to collapse they always assured the public that everything was fine and they blamed " rumors " for causing problems ; this week , the CEO of Bear Stearns and all the American journalists on Bear Stearns payroll blamed " rumors " and " irrational psychology " for causing a run on Bear Stearns ' money during the week .
The purpose of these lies is that it allows the insiders to cash out their money while the rest of the trusting American fools keep their money in , only to lose it later .
Then after the insiders cash out , comes the supposed " panic " and " sudden " collapse , best to take place on a Friday of course .
The " sudden collapse " and " panic " gives cover for the next even bigger transaction : the connected Bear Stearns banker calls the Central Bank Chief Bernanke , just as Khodorkovsky would call Dubinin or whoever was Central Bank chief then , and naturally Bernanke gives to Bear Stearns as many billions as the CEO asks for , and everyone thinks it 's okay because the billions were necessary in this atmosphere of alleged " sudden panic , " as if Bear Stearns and Bernanke had not been speaking to each other like phone sex addicts every day 24/7 the entire week .
Reports Bloomberg
The Fed is taking on the credit risk from collateral supplied by Bear Stearns , which approached the central bank for emergency funds , Fed staff officials said today .
The Fed , under Chairman Ben S. Bernanke , voted unanimously to lend the funds through JPMorgan because it would be operationally simpler than a direct loan to Bear Stearns , the staff said on condition of anonymity .
The regulator invoked a little - used law that allows it to make loans to corporations and private partnerships , which required a Board vote , according to the staffers .
Yes , you read that correctly .
In the exact replay of Yeltsin - oligarchs ' strategy to steal and steal , the Central Bank bailout money is not directly from the government to Bear Stearns , because that makes it harder to steal those billions .
Instead , it is funneled through another well - connected bank , J.P. Morgan , so that those corrupt bankers can also take a nice cut in the deal ( " otkat " it 's called ) .
Essentially the " bailout " is a massive bribe from corrupt Bush to corrupt J.P. Morgan , and in return JP Morgan will buy the ruins of Bear Stearns with the government money ( minus what they steal ) .
Meanwhile plenty of billions make sure that major Bear Stearns principles all cash out well .
Here comes the funny part .
How does " free speech " America hide this outright corruption and thieving from the population ?
Let a Russian explain to your naive innocent little American eyes : stop all this bullshit about " transparency " because it is no longer convenient :
The senior [ Central Bank ] staffers declined to describe how large the loan to Bear Stearns was , and declined to say whether a private - sector bailout was attempted before the Fed extended credit through JPMorgan .
NO ONE KNOWS HOW MANY BILLIONS THE U.S. GOVERNMENT JUST GAVE TO BEAR STEARNS , AND HOW MANY MORE BILLIONS WILL FOLLOW .
The ghost of Yeltsin lives in the Federal Reserve !
We do n't know anything , and we did n't know it was even legal , because American government and banks exploited " obscure never used " laws to justify outright corruption and fraud , according to
The arrangement employs a little - used Depression - era provision of the Federal Reserve Act .
It is sad to see Americans imitating the very worst Russians 10 years late , what incredible fucking losers you are !
And meanwhile the American masses have no fucking idea , free press or no free press , they just stand around like retarded jackasses with a sign on their backs that reads " ASS - FUCK ME " , because they trust their leaders .
Americans do n't know anything about Iraq anymore except that they 're winning , they do n't know hundreds of billions being stolen in front of their fat stupid faces , they do n't know anything except where to find a bargain on hamburger buns .
I almost cannot blame Bush and the bankers for stealing from American fools , it 's just too easy !
Let the bloodthirsty corrupt elite steal from the bloodthirsty retarded masses , it will hasten the final collapse of this cruel and shameful empire called " America . "
Meanwhile , U.S. dollar is now for the first time in history worth
The median price in a six - county area of Southern California fell to $ 408,000 -- the lowest level since October 2004 , when it was $ 402,500 .
All that just in a day !
Thank you God , thank you !
Okay , so today enough about a nation of losers .
Now let us consider a happier story today about a nation of winners .
The Russian stock market did n't even sneeze today , but instead modestly rose , near all - time record highs , proof that America is already irrelevant .
Today we learned that Russia 's January 's foreign trade surplus a record 86 % from 2007 .
A " trade surplus " for you American dumbfucks who only know words " debt " and " deficit " , the word trade " surplus " means more money coming into Russia than leaves .
You would not understand it though , too complicated for American debt - brained fuckers .
No , Americans have no fucking idea what is happening to them .
We Russians were not such trusting dumbshits , even against all odds , we did understand when it happened to us in the 1990s .
We are not trusting dumbshits Americans .
We fought but we were too weak to fight against Yeltsin regime , supported with hundreds of billions of American " loan " money , sophisticated propaganda which we still did n't understand , and guns .
Do not forget that the entire Yeltsin economy , including the notorious corrupt banking system , was forced upon us by United States government and the American investment bank advisers who were seated inside the Russian government at all times .
That is why today 's American banking collapse is so easy to understand for Russians .
Russians tried as early as in 1993 to stop the vicious Yeltsin / American " shock therapy " economics that turned a proud nation into desperate paupers .
I remember the dark time because even though I was just a student in 1993 , my family suffered through this years together .
First we lost all savings , and first my grandfather and then two uncles died quickly and brutally .
Our democratically elected parliament tried to stop Yeltsin " shock therapy " and throw out American " free market advisers " to save what was left .
Americans and Yeltsin decided democracy was not good anymore so Yeltsin , the democrat , ordered tanks to attack the opposition parliament in 1993 .
He killed several hundred brave Russian patriots , who died fighting against this corrupt ruinous American " shock therapy " economics .
We were crushed with tanks , you see .
Naturally President Clinton immediately supported Yeltsin , showing who was the real master of that putsch against Russian democracy .
It meant something that Clinton immediately gave his support to Yeltsin .
It was like a wartime defeat .
I can tell you , back then we were in such awe of America , we had no choice but to accept defeat , it was hopeless .
We lost the power to stop banks and government from stealing every last part of Russia , until the final collapse in 1998 .
It took tanks to keep Russians down while they robbed the country .
Tanks , and American money .
What is your excuse today , Americans ?
There are no tanks , no Russian interference to destroy you and demoralize you .
Why do you let your leaders steal everything your country has ?
Why do you sit passively like slaves who mated with sheep , the sheep - slaves with a big stupid smile on your fat fucking faces ?
You are not even human beings , you deserve worse than a total collapse of you country , you deserve to be wiped off the face of this planet forever , as if you were just an embarrassing accident and it will never happen again , you sickening pussy sub - human dumbfucks !
Oh fuck , now ruined my good mood .
I need to run back to my friends now to celebrate your collapse .
There will be time for bitter memories of the 1990s .

Deadly emerging diseases have risen steeply across the world and an international research team has provided the first scientific evidence mapping the outbreaks ’ main sources .
They say :
New diseases originating from wild animals in poor nations are the greatest threat to humans and ;
Expansion of humans into shrinking pockets of biodiversity and resulting contacts with wildlife are the reason .
Meanwhile , richer nations are nursing other outbreaks , including multidrug - resistant pathogen strains , through overuse of antibiotics , centralized food processing and other technologies .
Zoonotic pathogens passed from wildlife to people , from lowest occurrence ( green ) to highest ( red ) .
Credit : Nature
Emerging diseases — defined as newly identified pathogens , or old ones moving to new regions -- have caused devastating outbreaks already .
The HIV / AIDS pandemic , thought to have started from human contact with chimps , has led to over 65 million infections ; recent outbreaks of SARS originating in Chinese bats have cost up to $ 100 billion .
Outbreaks like the exotic African Ebola virus have been small , but deadly .
Despite three decades of research , previous attempts to explain these seemingly random emergences were unsuccessful .
In the new study , researchers from four institutions analyzed 335 emerging diseases from 1940 to 2004 , then converted the results into maps correlated with human population density , population changes , latitude , rainfall and wildlife biodiversity .
They showed that disease emergences have roughly quadrupled over the past 50 years .
Some 60 % of the diseases traveled from animals to humans ( such diseases are called zoonoses ) and the majority of those came from wild creatures .
With data corrected for lesser surveillance done in poorer countries , “ hot spots ” jump out in areas spanning sub-Saharan Africa , India and China ; smaller spots appear in Europe , and North and South America .
“ We are crowding wildlife into ever - smaller areas , and human population is increasing , ” said coauthor Marc Levy , a global - change expert at the Center for International Earth Science Information Network ( CIESIN ) , an affiliate of Columbia University ’s Earth Institute .
“ The meeting of these two things is a recipe for something crossing over . ”
The main sources are mammals .
Some pathogens may be picked up by hunting or accidental contact ; others , such as Malaysia ’s Nipah virus , go from wildlife to livestock , then to people .
Humans have evolved no resistance to zoonoses , so the diseases can be extraordinarily lethal .
The scientists say that the more wild species in an area , the more pathogen varieties they may harbor .
Kate E. Jones , an evolutionary biologist at the Zoological Society of London and first author of the study , said the work urgently highlights the need to prevent further intrusion into areas of high biodiversity .
“ It turns out that conservation may be an important means of preventing new diseases , ” she said .
About 20 percent of known emergences are multidrug - resistant strains of previously known pathogens , including tuberculosis .
Richer nations ’ increasing reliance on modern antibiotics has helped breed such dangerous strains , said Peter Daszak , an emerging - diseases biologist with the Consortium for Conservation Medicine at the Wildlife Trust , another Earth Institute affiliate , who directed the study .
Daszak said that some strains , such as lethal variants of the common bacteria e. coli , now spread widely with great speed because products like raw vegetables are processed in huge , centralized facilities .
“ Disease can be a cost of development , ” he said .
The group ’s analyses showed also that more diseases emerged in the 1980s than any other decade — likely due to the HIV / AIDS pandemic , which led to other new diseases in immune - compromised victims .
In the 1990s , insect - transmitted diseases saw a peak , possibly in reaction to rapid climate changes that started taking hold then .
Team members soon hope to study this possibility and its future implications .
Daszak says the study has immediate uses .
“ The world ’s public - health resources are misallocated , ” he said .
“ Most are focused on richer countries that can afford surveillance , but most of the hotspots are in developing countries .
If you look at the high - impact diseases of the future , we ’re missing the point . ”
Team members say nations must share more technology and resources in hotspots to reduce risk .
“ We need to start finding pathogens before they emerge , ” said Daszak .
The study appears in the Feb. 21 issue of Nature .
In addition to the ZSL and Earth Institute researchers , the study was coauthored by John L. Gittleman , dean of the Odum School of Ecology , University of Georgia .
WASHINGTON , D.C. - Workplace bullying could cause more harm to employees than sexual harassment , researchers say .
Belittling comments , exclusion from outings and criticism of work may seem relatively benign and get brushed off by business higher - ups as " kid 's stuff . "
But the consequences to employees and even the bottom line are far from child 's play .
" Organizations do n't realize that just rude behaviors , ongoing discourteous types of behaviors , have such negative effects on employees , " said Sandy Hershcovis , assistant professor of business at the University of Manitoba , who is presenting research here today at the Seventh International Conference on Work , Stress and Health .
The meeting was co-sponsored by the American Psychological Association , the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health , and the Society for Occupational Health Psychology .
" Unless you 're in the situation you just do n't understand , " Hershcovis told LiveScience .
" A lot of people say , ' Oh it 's just a personality conflict , they do n't really mean it . '
But when you 're in the situation - and many of us have been - it 's pretty horrible . "
Bully prevalence The Workplace Bullying Institute found in a nationally representative poll last year that 37 percent of the U.S. workforce , or 54 million employees , have been bullied now or some time during their work life .
" Anything that affects 37 percent of the public is an epidemic .
But it 's a silent epidemic , " said Gary Namie , Director of the Workplace Bullying Institute in Bellingham , Wash .
Evidence from several research fields , including law , communications , business management and psychology , are revealing the hardships that targets of bullying face , and they ain't pretty .
" Targets of severe workplace bullying are suffering from physical and psychological conditions that would just drive even the strongest of us into the ground , " said David Yamada , of Suffolk University Law School in Boston .
Yamada chaired a presentation session here on workplace bullying .
Bully consequences Hershcovis and Julian Barling of Queen 's University in Ontario , Canada , reviewed 110 studies conducted over 21 years and involving the consequences of workplace aggression and sexual harassment .
The research duo focused on 12 consequences , including : job satisfaction , co-worker and supervisor satisfaction , job stress , intent to quit , psychological and physical well - being , anger and anxiety levels , withdrawal from work and level of commitment .
Bullying is just one form of so - called workplace aggression , which the researchers divided into categories :
Incivility : rudeness and discourteous verbal and non-verbal behaviors .
Bullying : persistently criticizing employees ' work ; yelling ; repeatedly reminding employees of mistakes ; spreading gossip or lies ; ignoring or excluding workers ; and insulting employees ' habits , attitudes or private life .
Interpersonal conflict : behaviors of hostility , verbal aggression and angry exchanges .
Compared with sexually harassed workers , employees on the receiving end of raging - boss behaviors and other forms of workplace aggression reported lower overall well - being , less job satisfaction and less satisfaction with their bosses ; they were also more likely to quit their jobs .
Specifically the bullied employees reported more job stress , less job commitment and higher levels of anger and anxiety than did sexually harassed employees .
The upshot The review results by Hershcovis and Barling suggest that bullies can wreak more havoc on a company than can sexual harassment .
" I want to make sure that 's not misinterpreted to mean that sexual harassment did n't also have negative outcomes ; it did , " Hershcovis said .
" It 's just that bullying was worse . "
Some explanations for the findings include the fact that sexual harassment is illegal .
" There is a legal outlet to victims of sexual harassment , " Hershcovis said .
" Organizations have policies in place to prevent and deal with it .
That ability to voice may give employees who experience sexual harassment some kind of hope . "
In addition , since sexual aggression is illegal , the victims may be more likely to blame the perpetrator and not themselves , as can happen with workplace bullying , Hershcovis said .
Bully ban ?
Beating up the bully may succeed on playgrounds , but inside the business world success is not so clear - cut .
For one , often the bully is the boss or other manager , and so fighting back could cost a job .
While some countries , such as Sweden , and places like Quebec and Saskatchewan have implemented some form of anti-bullying workplace legislation , researchers here agree the United States has done little in the form of anti-bullying laws .
Corporations in the United States also lack policies for preventing or dealing with workplace aggression .
" Employers ignore bullying because they can .
Its legality is what gives them the license to ignore it , " Namie said during his presentation at the conference .
Following in the footsteps of sexual harassment , however , bullying could gain enough awareness for legal action .
" Where we are now with workplace bullying is where we were with sexual harassment maybe 15 years ago , " said Suzy Fox of Loyola University in Chicago , " before we had key court cases , before we had the major Anita Hill blow - up . "
( In 1991 , Hill , a law professor at the time , came forward with accusations that Supreme Court justice nominee Clarence Thomas had sexually harassed her . )
And like sexual harassment , workplace bullying needs a clear definition , Fox noted .
" Bullying is often more subtle , and may include behaviors that do not appear obvious to others , " Hershcovis said .
" For instance , how does an employee report to their boss that they have been excluded from lunch ?
Or that they are being ignored by a coworker ?
The insidious nature of these behaviors makes them difficult to deal with and sanction . "
Uncle Sam wants you ... to become a cyberspace warrior .
In a document released this week , the US Air Force is laying out plans for a new cyber command , which is scheduled to become operational in October .
It tries to make the case that the ability to wage war and parry attacks over electronic networks is crucial to maintaining national security .
" Controlling cyberspace is the prerequisite to effective operations across all strategic and operational domains - securing freedom from attack and freedom to attack , " the document , titled Air Force Cyber Command Strategic Vision , states .
" We will develop and implement plans for maturing and expanding cyberspace operations as an Air Force core competency . "
Its definition of cyberspace is considerably broader than that of many in the security field , encompassing electronic communications that take place over the internet , but also those in the air and space .
That includes conducting operations in the electromagnetic spectrum , presumably to fight against electromagnetic pulse attacks , which could disrupt the nation 's electronic devices by setting off a high - altitude nuclear blast .
" Cyberspace attacks can be conducted on an adversary 's terrestrial , airborne and space - based communication infrastructure as well as his forces , equipment and logistics , " the document ( PDF here ) says .
Other areas of expertise include sensor disruption , data manipulation , decision support degradation , command and control disruption and weapon system degradation .
The document is the latest push by US military leaders for more authority and funding for cyberspace .
The campaign has been ramping up amid a growing number of intelligence disclosures that finger the People 's Republic of China as a threat to the US communications infrastructure .
Earlier this week , the Pentagon released an assessment of China 's military might that included cautionary statements about attacks to numerous computer networks , including some belonging to the US government .
While it remained unclear if the intrusions were conducted by the People 's Liberation Army , " developing capabilities for cyberwarfare is consistent with authoritative PLA writings on this subject , " the report warned .
Additionally , Defense Department officials speaking on Capitol Hill last week said enemies are keenly aware of the government 's dependence on the internet and continue to look for ways to exploit it .
And according to Federal Computer Week , President Bush issued a classified directive in January designed to fortify government networks , including possible offensive tactical maneuvers .
While some may see the military push as little more than a power grab , Alan Paller , director of research at the SANS Institute , is not among them .
He says the US military leadership was slow to act on intelligence reports in 1990s that the Russian KGB had founded a school for cyber hacking .
He says it 's important leaders do n't make similar mistakes in response to intelligence reports concerning China .
" The reason that we 're willing to spend so much money right now is that the Chinese in particular had visible and massive success in not only penetrating our systems and stealing highly sensitive military information but also taking over our systems so they can control them in the future , " he says .
" It 's essential that we do this . " ®
The performance and strategy of Exxon Mobil Corp. is a good place to start in grasping the twilight years of the investor - owned oil sector that has dominated the extraction of petroleum resources since the industry began in the 1850s .
Putting aside the Valdez debacle of 1989 , Exxon has been the best - managed of the oil majors .
Exxon has avoided the faked - reserve scandals that have plagued rival Royal Dutch / Shell PLC , the Alaskan pipeline ruptures and fatal refinery explosions that forced out the CEO of BP PLC , and thoughtmore than twice before committing to its multibillion - dollar bets on gargantuan offshore oil - production platforms , heavy - oil projects in Athabasca , and signing production contracts with the state - owned oil agencies that control about 90 per cent of the world 's petroleum reserves .
The same state - owned agencies who have an unsettling habit of ripping up those contracts — as in Russia , Venezuela and Kazakhstan , among other countries — to demand a heftier share of output when oil prices skyrocket , as they have in recent years .
As the industry 's most consistently successful player , Exxon 's dilemmas offer a disturbing forecast for a business in decline .
For a variety of reasons , but mostly shifts in geopolitics , it 's increasingly easy to imagine a world not too far off in which Exxon and its investor - owned peers have given way to ascendant state - owned resource giants , at least in the " upstream , " or exploration and development part of the industry , traditionally the most lucrative end of the business , compared with " downstream " refining and distribution activities .
Exxon is the world ’s largest investor - owned oil firm , and produces more oil than any OPEC nation apart from Saudi Arabia and Iran .
On staggering 2007 revenues of $ 404 billion ( U.S. ) , Exxon posted earnings of $ 40.6 billion , the biggest annual profit in the history of capitalism .
The market capitalization of Exxon , which began life as John D. Rockefeller 's Standard Oil of New Jersey , has more than doubled over the past five years , to half a trillion dollars .
Thus ends the good news .
Exxon 's production dropped 2.4 per cent last year , a fate shared with its biggest investor - owned peers .
( Shell 's production slumped 4 per cent . )
On the exploration side , Exxon failed to replace 24 per cent of its production with new reserves , its worst " reserve ratio " showing in three years .
With reserves increasingly difficult to find , drawing Exxon and its rivals into more costly , remote and politically volatile regions , Exxon has seen its failure rate of exploratory wells searching for commercially viable pools of oil or natural gas rise to 46 per cent , up from 36 per cent in 2006 .
Exxon 's production cost per barrel soared 18 per cent last year , following a 13 per cent rise the year before .
The company in March committed to a 20 per cent increase in spending on exploration and refinery upgrades , to more than $ 25 billion , or an industry record of $ 68 million per day .
But that hike will do little more than cover the spiralling cost of everything from drilling rigs to engineers .
At a March 5 conference with analysts in New York , Exxon unveiled an impressive number of new exploration and production projects , a dozen of which are set to begin this year alone .
Exxon hopes to bring new fields into production in the Middle East , Africa and Russia by 2012 ; recently brought a large offshore Angola field into production ; and is adding to its network of enormous liquefied natural gas ( LNG ) operations in Qatar .
But Exxon will be fortunate if its new projects make up for declining production at its aging fields in the North Sea and Alaska .
Not that Rex Tillerson , Exxon ’s CEO , is the least bit apologetic about that scenario .
The average Fortune 500 CEO who promised investors zero volume growth through 2012 would soon be looking for a new job .
But this is the conservative oil business , whose executives recall the $ 10 per barrel crude of the late 1990s as if it was yesterday .
And no oil major has been more disciplined in capital spending than Irving , Texas - based Exxon .
As Tillerson explained to analysts early this month , Exxon does n't set a volume target and strive to achieve it , the way Procter & Gamble , Apple Inc. and Toyota Motor Corp. do .
Instead , it calculates the likely payoff from a potential project , factoring in setbacks like skilled - labour shortages and soaring rig-crew costs , and places its chips accordingly .
Which means passing on potentially high - volume plays vulnerable to Venezuela - type expropriation .
With good reason , BP announced with considerable fanfare the Russian partnership it struck earlier this decade , since it would account for about one - quarter of BP 's total reserves .
BP 's share of its flagship Russian project has been repeatedly reduced , ceded to its Russian state - owned partner , following Kremlin accusations against BP of everything from fraud to environmental degradation – charges that mysteriously disappear once BP consents to a lower share of output , only to recur , accompanied by police raids on BP 's Russian offices , when the Putin / Medvedev regime clamours for still more .
Exxon was spared the water torture treatment in Venezuela , where the Chavez regime simply expropriated properties once Exxon 's technology had brought them into production .
Given the potential for devastating reversals , Exxon does n’t see itself on a mission to ensure energy security in North America or elsewhere .
The shareholders come first , last and always .
" It really goes back to what is an acceptable investment return for us , " Tillerson told the analysts .
Last year , Exxon spent more money buying back its stock – $ 36 billion – than on reinvesting in the business .
Since replacing his similarly unsentimental predecessor , Lee Raymond , in January of last year , Tillerson , 55 , has raised capital spending just 18 per cent against a 75 per cent jump in expenditures on share buybacks .
That gambit increases earnings per share , but obviously does n't add a drop of oil or gas to the firm 's reserves in order to sustain the business .
Yet Shell and Chevron Corp. also are furiously buying back their stock , at a rate that will see Exxon and Chevron retire all of their stock by about 2024 .
It comes down to this : buying back the company 's stock is a far more certain bet on increasing investor returns than operating a new deep - water drilling program .
In the past , consolidation has been the industry ’s response to declining reserves .
Companies simply bought oil on the stock market rather than drilling for it , which accounted for the late - 1990s merger wave that brought Amoco and Arco into the BP fold , the merger of Exxon with Mobil Corp. , the amalgamation of French giants Total and Elf , and the creation of ConocoPhillips Co. , among other combinations .
The Canadian oil patch would be especially vulnerable to a future takeover trend : the total 2007 revenues of Calgary 's eight - largest Canadian - owned firms was $ 97 billion , about 19 per cent of Exxon 's market cap .
But mergers do n't add to global oil supply .
The merger rationale was that firms with a more substantial " critical mass " could better afford to undertake ever costlier megaprojects .
That notion went out the window when the likes of Exxon Mobil learned that even the world 's largest corporation can be stripped of its assets by the likes of Hugo Chavez .
Indeed , all of the " super majors " created in the last merger wave have been forced to surrender production under contracts with producing nations by which those nations gain a larger share of output as crude prices increase .
Example : Chevron Corp. was producing almost 2.7 million barrels of oil a day in 2002 when it acquired oil giant Texaco .
Last year , Chevron 's daily production was 2.6 million barrels a day , making a hash of Chevron 's 2002 expectation of increasing the combined firms ' volume by 3 per cent by 2006 .
Like its rivals , Chevron lost output under production - sharing contracts with oil - producing nations , and was hit with an unfavourable contract revision dictated by Venezuela .
Which suggests that the petroleum industry of the future will belong to the state - owned enterprises .
After working in some cases for decades with the investor - owned giants , state oil firms have accumulated enough of the required technology to forsake joint ventures and go it alone .
They have every incentive to do so in those many oil - producing nations in which oil and gas are the sole , or largest , source of export revenue , no longer to be shared with investors in companies based in London and Houston .
It 's beginning to look like the investor - owned sector 's long - term plan is to phase itself out of business , becoming a glorified annuity that returns outsized dividends to a dwindling number of investors from a dwindling reserve base .
As early as 2001 , oil analyst Charles Maxwell of Weeden & Co. of Greenwich , Conn. , told Bloomberg News , the investor - owned oil majors will no longer be able to increase their production .
" They 'll be in liquidation , " he said .
An apt expression for an industry running out of juice .
David Olive is a business columnist with the Star .

It all began when David Shuster asked Rep. Marsha Blackburn ( R - TN ) if she could name the last soldier from her district who was killed in Iraq .
She could not , so he told her who it was .
It was later reported that the soldier Shuster named was not from Blackburn 's district and Shuster apologized for the error on air .
Now it turns out that Shuster was right in the first place .
But being right was never a major article of concern for the right and they are still hammering Shuster .
Even Brit Hume at Fox News participated in the pile on .
Now , according to Politico , Republicans are escalating the battle to new heights :
" We do n’t mind skipping MSNBC .
No one watches that channel anyway , " says a high - placed Republican consultant .
Word is , a growing number of GOP lawmakers have become mysteriously " unavailable " when asked to appear on MSNBC .
This would be a sublime development .
I have long been advocating that Democrats and progressives swear off of Fox News ( see Starve The Beast ) .
Rupert Murdoch and his media megaphone is openly hostile to our agenda and our representatives .
They will only use these appearances to distort our message and derail our mission .
Studies have proven that their audience is unreceptive , and even antagonistic , to us and by appearing we will be rewarded more with ridicule than respect .
It has been difficult to advance this strategy because the siren 's call of the TV camera still lures people to Fox .
Now , ironically , it is Republicans who are openly promoting the concept in reverse .
If their effort has the residual effect of causing a reciprocal boycott of Fox , it will be well worth it .
They wo n't miss MSNBC and we wo n't miss the further propagation of their propaganda .
Update on Shuster :
It appears he was strong - armed into the premature apology by his boss .
M41 - A Pulse Rifle
One of the coolest sci - fi weapons of all time , recreated .
M41 - A Finished at last !
Some sci - fi props are cool , some are neat , and some are just plain corny .
To qualify for cool , the prop has to strike a special nerve for me .
The M41 - A Pulse Rifle is such a prop .
As seen in the 1986 movie " Aliens " , this prop became an instant classic .
With is fully functional hero models that fired 45 cal .
blanks , and blank 12 guage shot gun rounds , to the ultra - slick O.D. green shrounds , this prop is the rare weapon that seemed it could actually do what it appeared to do in the movie !
Shoot !
This ain't no raygun , baby !
Made from three real world weapons , the M41 - A even has a cool sounding name .
The World War II vintage M1A1 Thompson makes up the bulk of the weapon , and the Remington 870 shotgun is the guts for the " grenade launcher " .
Carefully hidden inside a SPAS - 12 heat shield cage and pump handle .
The filming hero prop was made with a metal shroud , and is truly a work of art .
What follows on this page is my online diary of the construction of my M41 - A .
Although it is made like the filming props , all the firearms had been deactivated , and can never fire a live round again .
As per BATF requirements .
Introduction : After 18 months , a lot of help from Kip H. and Phil S. , a bankrupt credit card , and a lot of flack from the wife , I am finally ready to start the building process .
After careful examination of this project , I 've decided to break this down into its basic components , build them up and and then attempt a final assembly .
The construction of M41 - A will be within the guidlines of the law .
Period .
Project components : SPAS 12 Shotgun cage and pump handle deactivated Remington M870 Shotgun parts M1 - A1 Thompson parts Custom made small parts , grip and grenade launcher block .
Two versions of the SPAS 12 cage and pump handle .
Top is the cheap Airsoft , bottom is the real deal .
Replica " deluxe " resin Remington 870 with moving parts .
custom made shroud Magazine bottom Bolt and upper receiver
The parts are difficult to find .
Remaining true to the original prop construction , and remaining within the guidlines of the US law , I decided to go with as many real gun parts as possible .
No one offers a turn key M1A1 , even the kits lack many of the needed parts .
Most do n't offer the SPAS 12 or M1A1 parts .
This project really was a find as you go project .
I started with resin replicas and upgraded them when I got the real parts .
Note :
The pic of the M1A1 is the resin replica .
i never took a picture of the real thing .
The Grenade Launcher : Rem870 / SPAS12
Assembly complete before painting .
final assembly , after painting flat black .
Ready to install .
The SPAS / Rem870 " Grenade launcher " is by far the most challenging part of the whole build .
My first attempt was to use some cheap airsoft SPAS12 .
As it turns out , these are not very accurate , complete , or to scale .
A version can be made to work , but the airsoft cage will require a lot of modifying .
Locating a real SPAS12 pump handle and cage is hard work .
No online sources still have any , your best bet is to post some requests on the RPF , ASAP , or the BBC and other forums , and go to local gun shows looking for parts .
I was lucky found a real SPAS cage / pump handle set .
The grenade launcher requires a cut down Remington 870 shotgun and a lot of custom fitting / cutting .
In addition , there are several greeblies to add to make this work .
To complete the grenade launcher requires destroying a functioning Rem 870 , and chopping parts of the SPAS .
For me , it is the hardest part to get going .
I really hate messing up perfectly good parts !
I had the option to cut down a real Rem 870 or use a resin replica from Kip .
Remaining true to the original mission of this prop , [ to build it like the originals prop makers did , ] I decided to go with the real one .
The only change will be to use a dummy wooden dowel barrel , deactivate the bolt , weld a spacer block in front of the receiver , forever making the receiver of the 870 from ever beign able to add a real barrel , or chamber a round .
Thats the law .
This way , I still get the real parts and keep it legal .
One of the best sources for real Remington 870's are local pawn shops .
These are very common , and can be had for as little as $ 150 .
Ask for an " Express " these have plain stocks , and a matt finish .
I also got a resin replica from Kip , and I will use it along with the extra parts I have to build a stunt version M41 - A . The M1A1 Thompson The available M1A1 kit .
As you can see most of the M1A1 is used .
A welded block is added to the front of the receiver to comply with ATF demill specifications .
M1A1 parts assembled and ready to paint and mount .
This is the only pic I have of the real M1A1 lower .
At $ 225 from Sarco , this is the most expensive single piece of the prop .
Detail of the business end of the M41 - A Final paint and its ready to mate to the Grenade launcher .
Final assembly before shroud installation .
Final Assembly before counter and tab greeblies are glued on .
Next is the M1A1 modifications .
A lot of M41 - a builders use Tokyo Mauri airsoft M1A1's , as a foundation .
I decided I wanted to stay as true to the originals as I could , which means real or replica M1A1 parts .
As it turns out , the upper receiver , the part of the weapon the BATF calls a gun , is available regularly , on the internet .
Sold in 80 % complete form , these are not considered to be functioning receivers .
Much machine work is to be done and you really do n't need and modifications unless you want a working bolt .
[ for this the receiver requires a metal block to be welded to the front ]
See the link section for parts suppliers .
The " grip frame assembly " the part with the trigger and all the switches , is VERY difficult to locate .
SARCo . has them for $ 225 and includes the wooden pistol grip .
These are very greasy , rusty and beat up .
They will require a lot of cleaning , and painting .
My suggestion is to get one before they are all gone .
Long since past are the availability of WWII issue M1A1 Thompson parts kits .
No vendors have them , and when one comes up on Ebay , expect to pay $ 600 + for it .
Unless you want to build a complete M1A1 replica , you do n't really need any other parts from a parts kit , except the stock mount bolt and the bolt handle .
[ complete bolt if you want a working one . ]
Kip also sells a resin/ metal M1A1 parts set that includes only the parts you need for a M41 - A .
These are very nice , and detailed , and include real M1A1 parts .
You could even build a Replica M1A1 with his kit if you could got a stock set , and a barrel .
I got lucky and found a 80 % replica metal upper and real grip frame .
I will use the resin version for the stunt M1A1 .

There are at least 3 online vendors selling plastic , resin , and resin / fiberglass versions .
I went with the resin / fiberglass ones .
Mainly for price .
The smaller parts , can be made from items bought at the local hardware store .
No one is making metal shrouds .
The stock can be made or Dean O. sells them .
He also sells the barrel vent and triangle .
The famous counter can be had from Phil S .
He also sells the grenade launcher front block as well as a host of other M41 - A parts .
Aside from the shroud , most of the remaining parts can be fabricated from metal , styrene even wood stock .
I have seen pictures of " hardware " store made shroud sets .
I am too lazy to make a shroud set when I can get one for $ 70 .
Final Assembly & Paint Final Fitting before color .
Fitting after color .
Weathering and small parts , a lighted counter a back strap , and sling are still to be added .
Also , the pump handle needs a re-work .
Tips on Getting Started The Pump Handle :
Once the parts have been bought , its time to get building .
First the SPAS Pump handle .
Its on the second " Short " line .
You will also have to cut the ejector port slot for the handle as well .
Fit it to the SPAS cage and play with its action .
Get to hacking , do n't be timid !
Cut that thing down !
Also , you will need to heat it up so that you can work its action on the finished SPAS cage .
Microwave a big bowl of water or boil some H2O on the stove .
Take the water off the heat , and , dip the pump handle in the hot water .
Let it set a few seconds , then pull it out some .
Spreading it apart .
By the time the rem 870 gets installed , the cage swells a little making the pump handle difficult to operate .
The SPAS - 12 Cage :
If you can find it !
Man this part is hard to get .
Practice cutting the ejection port on a Airsoft version first .
Measure about a dozen times before you star cutting up the real thing .
Look closely at pictures of the real one , and take particular note on how how it lines up with the ejection port with the Rem 870 and the slots on the cage .
Make the straight cuts first .
use a Dremel with a cut - off disc .
Besides the ejection port , the area where you load the shells will have to be cut , and the front end , and a couple of the left hand side struts will have to be clipped to make way fro the Rem870 action .
There are a lot of places you can screw up the cage .
Take it easy .
The Stock :
This part can be made by hand or purchased online .
You can decide if you want it a " functional " retracting stock , or permanently fixed .
I went with a fixed stock , mainly because you never saw the stock in the out position , and it looks kind of dorky all the way out .
Just bolt that sucker to the M1A1 upper .
You will have to drill and tap holes in the upper to bolt it on .
The Shrouds :
Take your time fitting these together .
Paint them any Army OD color you want , but do n't go too " Green " .
Test some deer stand paints at your local pawn shops .
I found that this paint is better than any other to give your PR that " screen seen " look .
Also know as " duck boat paint "
To me , the bestrewn looks way off in person .
It may be accurate to the original prop , but when your friends look at that brown shroud , they will say , " Man , what happened to the color ?
That 's suppose to be green ! "
IMHO .
Mounting the M1A1 to the Launcher :
If your Upper has that BATF required front block , then you can drill holes straight through .
All you will have to do then is mark where the bolts hit the Rem870 receiver , and drill and tap the Rem870 .
Take your time , because if you are off , your launcher will be crooked .
You will need at least 2 holes drilled to provide a decent firmness to the whole assembly .
The Paint :
Lot 's of M41 - A Pulse rifles are made using the original Humbrol " Bessbrown " paints .
Other use an idealized OD green color , or some combination .
It is my opinion , to try and paint the PR with a color that approximates the screen appearance .
This color is a brownish green .
Some builders use a Testor Model Master " umber " as a base color .
The Humbrol Bessbrown is no longer available , and is a difficult color to work with .
I 've tested many " off the shelf " army green colors , and the best I have found is Boss Game Systems Camouflage Olive Drab Spray Paint # 70 - DM - 2 , Bryan , TX 77803 http://www.bossgamesystems.com.
You will have to call and ask for the # 70 - DM - 2 color .
It is green , but has more of a military Olive color with a tint of brown that most OD green lacks .
In my opinion its a great compromise between what you saw in the movie , and what the real prop was painted .
After your friends laugh at that bessbrown , you will want to re-paint it something that looks more like what you saw on screen .
Good luck !
Below is a guesstimate on the cost of the hero vs. the stunt .
Granted The Stunt version has more hand fabricated parts , the cost is about 1/4 of the Hero .
Estimated costs : Real Parts Price [ HERO ] Resin Replica / Airsoft Price [ STUNT ]

Getting into SCM with git =========================
Understading git ----------------
There are various tutorials that explain git ; most of them assume that the reader is already familiar with other SCM tools , in fact many assume that the reader is an expert on distributed project managment ( kernel hacker , etc ) .
This short tutorial shall attempt to explain the git system to people who have no , or minimal experience on SCMs and version control tools .
Git as a tool for backups
-------------------------
Suppose you have a project with 10,000 files and you want to take periodic backups .
This task is not as simple as it seems .
One solution is to create a tar.gz archive of the entire thing and store it to the " safe location " .
However this is dangerous .
Suppose that you create one such tarball `backup. tgz` on Monday and save it .
Then on Wensday you accidentially delete a 9,000 files and then the crontab creates a new tarball at midnight and stores it in the " safe location " over the previous `backup. tgz` .
Files lost !
Experienced system administrators are aware of the above phenomenon and for that reason each tarball gets a new name that also contains the date when the tarball was created .
Thus , every day of the week we have a new tarball created as `backup- 01-07- 2007.tgz` , etc .
This schema is safe but it has the disadvantage that it takes too much space since each tarball includes the entire project .
One solution is to automatically delete very old tarballs ; this works but is still a little bit dangerous and you do n't have complete history of the project .
For such a task , git is an ideal tool .
It will guarantee very efficient storage and complete project history , forever .
The setup ---------
Suppose you have a folder with 4 files : A , B , C and D From this folder we type : git - init - db git add .
And we are ready .
Our " safe location " is the subdirectory `.git` that has been created .
Now , every time we need to take a backup we type : git commit - a -m ' Backup my files again ' and lets call this command `git backup` .
Git stores its objects in the directories below `.git/objects` .
When we type git - backup here is what happens :
For each file ( in A , B , C , D ) 1 . compress the data of the file 2 . save the compressed data to a file named after the SHA digest of the uncompressed data under `.git / objects` , unless such a file exists already !
So the first time we issue `git - backup` four new " blob objects " will be added to the git database ( assuming that all the files have different content ! )
You can find these files by listing the directories in `.git/objects` .
The command : git - cat - file -p hash will print the contents of a blob with the given hash ( or just the start of the hash if unambiguous ) .
At this point we learn that git stores * entire files * compressed with zlib .
These are the blob objects .
Blob objects are immutable and once such an object has been added under `.git` it can never be removed !
Now if later we modify , say , file ` A` and we issue git - backup , the same procedure will be invoked .
But since the content of the other three files has n't changed , nothing will be added to the database in their case .
Consequently only one new blob object will be added ( unless the new content of ` A` is the same as one of the other three files ! ) .
Now suppose even later that we change ` A` back to its original content and we run `git - backup` .
What will happen next ?
No new blobs will be added to the object database .
With these schema , all we have to do is update the subfolder `.git / ` periodically to the " safe location " .
Commit objects
--------------
Every time we run a `git - commit` command , a new " commit object " will be created ( and zero or more blobs , as we saw ) .
Each commit is some plaintext that mentions : - the HASH of the parent commit - the name of the author and the time of the commit - the HASHES of the blobs of the current tree ( actually the HASH a tree object )
This text is compressed with zlib and stored in a file named after the SHA digest of the uncompressed text .
So in our initial git - backup above , we should see that 6 objects have been created in the git database : - 4 blob objects with the contents of the files ( compressed ) , ( suppose with hashes starting with : fa0 , fb0 , fc0 , fd0 ) - 1 tree object ( suppose hash t0 ) - 1 commit object ( suppose hash c0 )
All these can be viewed with `git - cat - file` .
Running `git - cat - file -p c0` on the hash of the commit will reveal the hash of the tree .
Running `git - cat - file -p t0` on the hash of the tree will reveal the hashes of the blobs and the corresponding file names , in this case [ " A " --> fa0 , " B " --> fb0 , etc ] .
So , knowing the hash id of the latest commit , we can view the entire history of the project and extract the contents of any file during any backup state .
And this hash can be found by `cat`ing the file `.git/HEAD` .
Restoring backups
-----------------
Suppose that because a programmer forgot to initialize a local variable in a C program , this caused " Undefined Behavior " which resulted in the contents of the files " A , B , C , D " been filled with random data !
Oh the horror !
If the subfolder `.git` is intact , the files can be fully restored .
By typing : git log we will see a list of the hashes of the last commits .
Typing git checkout c0 will : - open commit object c0 and find that the tree of this commit is object t0 .
- open the tree object t0 and find that : - file " A " has blob " fa0 " , unzip the object fa0 and save its contents in " A " - do the same for the other files / blobs .
We were lucky the monitor did n't explode .
Version Control ===============
The backup schema we saw above , can be used for " version control " .
Version control basically means that when we are working on a project we want to be able to go back in time and see what we changed .
The reason is that some times we change things in order to make the project better , but later discover that our brain was n't working when we made those changes and we did something stupid .
Being able to go back in time is very important in this case because it allows us to * fully restore * a previous working state .
Thus we are able to undo mistakes and easilly see what were our intentions when we were changing something , even if not excessively commented .
Note that since objects are never removed from the git database , " undoing " a change does not move the project back in time .
It just creates a new state were the offending changeset is reverted with the use of an anti-patch patch .
Having this project history , also allows us to to bisection to detect which changes caused a regression , etc .
Tools that can do version control are CVS , SVN and others .
One caveat in version control that often programmers fall into is trying too much to have a perfect versioning history .
In this situation , the developer spends too much time trying to separate commits in semantically well described changes and attach too well written description messages .
And eventually , the energy spent in maintaining the versioning is more than the energy spent actually writting code !
Thus , the tool which was installed in order to increase the productivity of the programmer becomes an activity that wastes time , energy and money ( the perfect is the enemy of good ! ) .
Especially for projects in early development it may be preferable to make daily commits before going to sleep instead .
Going Distributed =================
Version control systems exist for more than 20 years and are indeed a very useful tool for software developers .
However , the challenge of the new millenium is the internet , open source software and many different developers working in parallel simultaneously on the same project , like ants .
The challenge in this case of distributed project maintenance is very different , and although giving network access to a CVS server may seem to be better than nothing , it is simply the wrong tool for the wrong job .
The most important thing in distributed project development is to achieve synchronization between the developers , and therefore ensure that developers wo n't edit the same part of the project at the same time , while at the same time allowing developers to work without waiting for others to finish their job .
The plot --------
Suppose you are the developer of the project with the files A , B , C and D .
After the initial commit , you edit all four files and make a second commit .
Thus so far the repository supposedly contains these objects : HEAD commit : c1 tree of c1 : t1 files of t1 : fa1 , fb1 , fc1 , fd1 parent of c1 : c0 tree of c0 : t0 files of t0 : fa0 , fb0 , fc0 , fd0 At this time , another developer , " developer Strobolovitch " whishes to work on the project and make valuable contributions , and henceforth the project becomes distributed .
First of all , developer Strobolovitch " clones " your repository .
That means that he downloads * all * the objects of your repository in his local hard disk .
Then the developer does a " checkout " of the head commit ( c1 ) and you are both looking at the same files .
Now you work in parallel :
On your local repository you edit file ` A` and then commit .
Thus the following objects exist in your repository : HEAD commit : c2 parent of c2 : c1 tree of c2 : t2 files of t2 : fa2 , fb1 , fc1 , fd1 On his workstation , developer Strobolovitch adds a new subsystem to file ` B` and commits .
The followin : objects exists on his repository : HEAD commit : c3 parent of c3 : c1 tree of c3 : t3 files of t3 : fa1 , fb2 , fc1 , fd1 Now it is time to sync and create a new tree that contains all the goodies that the two of you have implemented .
Because this is _your_ project and you are the git master , developer Strobolovitch issues a " please sir pull " request .
Via the network you connect to the developer 's workstation and fetch objects from his head commit .
That is git will download the objects : c3 , t3 , fb2 the other objects are n't downloaded because git sees that you have them already .
At this time , on your local repository you have two " branches " .
One which roots at commit ( c2 ) and one which is ( c3 ) .
Now you have to issue the command : git merge c2 c3 " Merge " will create a new commit ( with two parents ) as follows : HEAD commit : c4 parents of c4 : c2 , c3 tree of c4 : t4 files of t4 : fa2 , fb2 , fc1 , fd1 The rest of the story is completed with the developer will now pull from you .
And in order to do that he will only have to fetch the objects : c4 , c2 , t4 , t2 , fa2 And you now both sync'd and have identical trees .
In other words you are now both working on the next mini-version of the project .
Note that networking is required only on " sync " .
Merging -------
In the previous scenario , merging did something seemingly magical .
It took the best from the two branches .
But how did it know which blobs to pick ?
This is called a " tree - way merge " and it is based on the axiom that " all modifications are improvements " .
In order to do 3 way merge , the branches * need * to have a common ancestor .
And this is why commit objects are so important in git .
In the previous case the common ancestor was commit ( c1 ) .
In branch ( c2 ) file ` A` had been modified to ( fa2 ) .
On the other hand branch ( c3 ) file ` A` had n't been modified according to the common ancestor , and therefore the improvement would be merged by using the one from branch ( c2 ) .
And merging works for changes on the same file as long as patches do n't conflict .
Naturally , one can easilly imagine a case where " you " and the other " developer " modify something that will result in a conflict .
For example , both " you " and Strobolovitch change the first line of file ` A` .
And what happens then ???
This is defined as a " conflict " .
The truth is that conflicts * are * indeed very rare .
For a project like the kernel with nearly 16000 files every 100 patches it is highly unlikely that there will be two patches that modify the same parts of the same files , or even the same files .
And as long as developers " sync to the master " often , conflicts become more rare .
[ Actually the possibility for a conflict increases with the number of patches that have been applied to master since our last sync ] .
Also there is the issue of subsystem maintainers .
There each sub - maintainer is responsible for a part of the project and makes sure that changes to the specific part , first have to go through the specific maintainer 's repository .
Given the above we can say that automatic 3 - way merge works in 99 % of the times .
There is still the possibility for a conflict .
In this case the maintainer who tries to do the merge will be notified by git that merge failed due to conflicts .
Two things can happen : - the maintainer fixes the conflicts by hand ( git leaves files in a zombie state where one can see both alternatives ) - the maintainer tells to the developer that he cannot apply his improvements because there are conflicts and developer Strobolovitch'd better sync with the maintainer and then apply his improvements by hand on the latest snapshot , thank you .
In both cases , somebody has to resolve things manually .
Hierachrially distributed -------------------------
For projects that are very big and have many developers , git is used somewhat differently .
First of all the project space is divided in subsystems and maintainers of subsystems .
For example suppose that subsystem `audio/` is maintained by Maintainer John Bop .
Bop has cloned the master repository .
Developers who are interested in working on `audio / ` join the relevant mailing list and sync often to Bop 's repository .
When a developer modifies something , he creates a patch and sends it to the maintainer .
The maintainer applies the patch and commits his repository ; everybody interested in the subsystem syncs after a while ( including the developer who initiated the patch ) .
When a sufficient number of patches have been accumulateed , Bop issues a " please pull sir " request and his branch is merged in the official mainline system by the project 's top - level maintainer ( or the maintainer of the containing subsystem ) .
Every once in a while , the developers of audio sync to the mainline repository .
Because git is so efficient , they will only have to fetch objects that have been added to other subsystems .
The end =======
Because each commit object mentions the hash of its parent commit(s ) , it is possible to do 3 - way merge , and consequently let the tool take care of applying patches automatically .
This solves the one thing we want in distributed project development which is developers working in parallel , as well as efficient synchronization without the requirement of network access in order to use the tool .
In the end though , we saw that git is just a database of ( immutable ) objects that can be used for backups .
Version control , partial synchronization and consequently parallel distributed hierarchial development of big open source projects over the internet , are possible uses of this database system .

He may be a 25 - year veteran of Washington politics , and he may be a two - time leading GOP presidential candidate , but John McCain apparently still needs to work a bit on his “ message discipline ” problem .
John McCain said Monday that to win the White House he must convince a war - weary country that U.S. policy in Iraq is succeeding .
If he can ’t , “ then I lose .
I lose , ” the Republican said .
He quickly backed off that remark .
“ Let me not put it that stark , ” the likely GOP nominee told reporters on his campaign bus .
“ Let me just put it this way : Americans will judge my candidacy first and foremost on how they believe I can lead the county both from our economy and for national security .
Obviously , Iraq will play a role in their judgment of my ability to handle national security . ”
“ If I may , I ’d like to retract ‘ I ’ll lose . ’
But I do n’t think there ’s any doubt that how they judge Iraq will have a direct relation to their judgment of me , my support of the surge , ” McCain added .
“ Clearly , I am tied to it to a large degree . ”
Clearly , he is tied to Iraq , which is possibly why he was right the first time .
I find it fascinating that McCain , even now , just blurts out the first thing that comes into his head .
McCain has been on the campaign trail now for over a year — and that ’s just this cycle — answering questions about , among other things , Iraq .
But he ca n’t quite answer a question about what will happen if Americans reject his policy come November ?
As someone hoping McCain loses , it gives me hope that he has a habit of answering questions one way , and then wanting to give a different answer a few moments later .
E‘ strano parlare del ritardo dell ’ Italia nell ’estensione della copertura ADSL come di una notizia recente , perchè non lo è affatto : nonostante proclami e previsioni , siamo sempre stati indietro rispetto agli altri Paesi , europei e non solo .
Appena il 40 % dei comuni ha accesso alla banda larga , e questo dato non è comunque rappresentativo della realtà a causa delle ovvie disparità tra comuni diversi .
Sul banco degli imputati per questa situazione la mancanza assoluta di investimenti pubblici , che abbandona a se stessi i progetti di reti locali ( Brescia , Milano .. ) che , se estesi , potrebbero portare grnde beneficio ad ampie estensioni di territorio .
Ha pesato molto anche la crisi profonda di Telecom ( io mi permetto di aggiungere che la crisi è provocata anche dalla mancanza di investimenti ) di questi anni .
Pochi giorni fa è stato presentato il nuovo piano industriale dell ’azienda : come al solito le promesse sono tante e i numeri previsti per l’estensione delle reti molto alti .
Io non vorrei essere pessimista , ma purtoppo non penso che riusciranno a fare quanto previsto .
C’è da tenere presente inoltre che lo sviluppo del sistema potrebbe andare verso un ’altra direzione : con l’assegnazione delle frequenze per il Wi-Max si sono poste le basi per la costruzione di un’ampia copertura del territorio con rete senza fili .
Chissà che questa volta l’Italia possa andare verso il futuro .

News tells us that the top securities firms are handing out nearly $ 38 billion in seasonal bonuses , the highest total ever .
But there ’s a reason to temper the celebration , if only out of respect for an old friend who ’s not doing too well .
Even as the Wall Streeters are high - fiving and ordering up record shipments of Champagne and caviar , the American dream is on life - support .

He mentioned a poll of working families that had shown that their belief in that mythical dream that has sustained so many generations for so long is fading faster than sunlight on a December afternoon .
A biofuel startup in Illinois can make ethanol from just about anything organic for less than $ 1 per gallon , and it would n't interfere with food supplies , company officials said .
Coskata , which is backed by General Motors and other investors , uses bacteria to convert almost any organic material , from corn husks ( but not the corn itself ) to municipal trash , into ethanol .
" It 's not five years away , it 's not 10 years away .
It 's affordable , and it's now , " said Wes Bolsen , the company 's vice president of business development .
The discovery underscores the rapid innovation under way in the race to make cellulosic ethanol cheaply .
With the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 requiring an almost five - fold increase in ethanol production to 36 billion gallons annually by 2022 , scientists are working quickly to reach that breakthrough .
" It signals just how hot the competition is right now , " said David Friedman , research director of the clean vehicles program at the Union of Concerned Scientists .
" There are a lot of people diving into this right now , trying to figure out how to crack the nut .
This increases my confidence that someone will do it . "
Besides cutting production costs to fire sale prices , the process avoids some key drawbacks of making ethanol from corn , company officials said .
It would n't impact the food supply , and its net energy balance is high because the technique works almost anywhere using almost anything with great efficiency .
The end result will be E85 sold at the pump for about a dollar cheaper per gallon than gasoline , according to the company .
Coskata wo n't have a pilot plant running until this time next year , and it will produce just 40,000 gallons a year .
Still , several experts said Coskata shows enough promise to leave them cautiously optimistic .
" The question will come down to ' Can they deliver ? ' " said Nathanael Greene , a senior energy - policy analyst at the Natural Resources Defense Council .
" The approach is interesting and promising in the problems it addresses . "
Coskata uses existing gasification technology to convert almost any organic material into synthesis gas , which is a mix of carbon monoxide and hydrogen .
Rather than fermenting that gas or using thermo-chemical catalysts to produce ethanol , Coskata pumps it into a reactor containing bacteria that consume the gas and excrete ethanol .
Richard Tobey , Coskata 's vice president of engineering , says the process yields 99.7 percent pure ethanol .
Gasification and bacterial conversion are common methods of producing ethanol , but biofuel experts said Coskata is the first to combine them .
Doing so , they said , merges the feedstock flexibility of gasification with the relatively low cost of bacterial conversion .
Tobey said Coskata 's method generates more ethanol per ton of feedstock than corn- based ethanol and requires far less water , heat and pressure .
Those cost savings allow it to turn , say , two bales of hay into five gallons of ethanol for less than $ 1 a gallon , the company said .
Corn - based ethanol costs $ 1.40 a gallon to produce , according to the Renewable Fuels Association .
The company plans to have its first commercial - scale plant producing up to 100 million gallons of ethanol a year by 2011 .
Friedman and Greene said the timeline is realistic .
May Wu , an environmental scientist at Argonne National Laboratory , says Coskata 's ethanol produces 84 percent less greenhouse gas than fossil fuel even after accounting for the energy needed to produce and transport the feedstock .
It also generates 7.7 times more energy than is required to produce it .
Corn ethanol typically generates 1.3 times more energy than is used producing it .
Making ethanol is one thing , but there 's almost no infrastructure in place for distributing it .
But the company 's method solves that problem because ethanol could be made locally from whatever feedstock is available , Tobey said .
" You 're not bound by location , " he said .
" If you 're in Orange County , you can use municipal waste .
If you 're in the Pacific Northwest , you can use wood waste .
Florida has sugar .
The Midwest has corn .
Each region has been blessed with the ability to grow its own biomass . "
Still , consumers will need some way of getting that fuel into their vehicle .
Less than 1 percent of the nation 's 170,000 gas stations sell E85 , said Mike Omotoso , senior manager of the global power train group at J.D. Power & Associates .
" Even if you produce it county by county , you still need an infrastructure , " he said .
" People are n't going to go to some remote location for fuel . "
But with production set to ramp up quickly to meet the 36 billion gallon mandate , ethanol advocates believe it wo n't be long before E85 is widely available .

White tips may be areas of freshly exposed ice
Enlarge Image
The icy feature has been spotted in images from the European Space Agency 's ( Esa ) Mars Express spacecraft .
Ancient glaciers , many millions of years old , have been seen before on the Red Planet , but this one may only be several thousand years old .
The young glacier appears in the Deuteronilus Mensae region between Mars ' rugged southern highlands and the flat northern lowlands .
" If it was an image of Earth , I would say ' glacier ' right away , " Dr Gerhard Neukum , chief scientist on the spacecraft 's High Resolution Stereo Camera ( HRSC ) , told BBC News .
" We have not yet been able to see the spectral signature of water .
But we will fly over it in the coming months and take measurements .
On the glacial ridges , we can see white tips , which can only be freshly exposed ice . "
This is found in very few places on the Red Planet because as soon as ice is exposed to the Martian environment , it sublimates ( turns from a solid state directly into gas ) .
Flooding event
In Deuteronilus Mensae , Dr Neukum estimates that water came up from underground in the last 10,000 to 100,000 years .
" That means it is an active glacier now .
This is unique , and there are probably more , " said Dr Neukum .
The water subsequently froze over and glaciers developed , the researcher from the Free University in Berlin , Germany , explained .
Not all researchers share his view of events .
Some believe that snowfall causes glaciers to develop on Mars , as it does on Earth .
But Gerhard Neukum thinks there is too little precipitation on the Red Planet for this to be the case .
Glacial features have been seen before on the Olympus Mons volcano .
But these are thought to be about four million years old .
Dr Neukum said glacial features would be prime locations for robotic rovers to look for evidence of life on Mars .
If microbes survive deep below Mars , they could be transported to the surface by water gushing up from deep underground .
Last month , Esa celebrated Mars Express 's five thousandth orbit of the Red Planet .
The unmanned probe arrived at Mars on 25 December 2003 .

Students in New York have less access to computers in public schools than students in most other parts of the country , according to a new report .
The availability of computers for fourth - graders in New York was 93 percent – 2 percent below the national average – while the number of students per terminal was 4.3 , slightly higher than the national average .
Access to computers for eighth - graders in New York was lower than for fourth - graders , but was even with the national average of 83 percent .
The sub -par showing resulted in New York earning a D grade for access – while the majority of states got a C .
The state also fared poorly on the use of technology in schools , scoring a D + in part because it lacked computer - based tests and virtual schools , according to the report by the Washington , DC - based Editorial Projects in Education .
“ It ’s particularly important because we know that disadvantaged kids do n’t necessarily have the same access to technology outside of school as kids who come from more affluent homes , ” said Caroline Hendrie , executive project editor of the report , Technology Counts .
New York fared better in its technology - training requirements for teachers and administrators – earning a B - that bumped up its overall rating to a C - .
West Virginia was the only state that earned an A , while Georgia and South Dakota scored A- grades .
At the bottom , Nevada , Oregon , and Rhode Island earned D grades , while the District of Columbia ranked last , with a D - .

AJ Rossmiller of AmericaBlog has a great new book out today , Still Broken : A Recruit ’s Inside Account of Intelligence Failures , from Baghdad to the Pentagon .
There have been a few posts giving it strong praise so far : Matt Yglesias , Jill at Feministe , and I expect there to be many more as people pick it from book stores .
AJ himself has a great statement of why books matter at AmericaBlog .
Still Broken is an account of Rossmiller ’s desire to serve America following the September 11th attacks .
He ends up working at the Defense Intelligence Agency , as a civilian analyst doing critical work for one of the key agencies in our intelligence community , particularly given the ongoing war in Iraq .
Rossmiller volunteered to serve in Iraq , spending six months doing strategic and tactical analysis in Baghdad and earning high praise for his work .
He returned to the Pentagon following his deployment and continued to analysis intelligence from Iraq , primarily on politics in Iraq .
After almost two years in the DIA , Rossmiller left because of problems internal to the intelligence community , from structural incompetence to the pressures of policy having influence on factual analysis .
Still Broken is a frightening book .
Throughout his tenure at the DIA , but most particularly in his time at the Pentagon , Rossmiller feels the pressure of people higher up the chain in command to confirm his analysis to the policy desires of the administration .
In the book he frequently relates stories of he and his analyst colleagues watching in horror as higher - ups with no expertise in Iraq change their findings without basis .
Their work is second - guessed as “ too pessimistic . ”
Yet time and again , the superiors are proved wrong , while the analysts are proven right .
What makes Still Broken so scary is n’t that analysts butt heads with their superiors , but rather that their superiors never look retrospectively at their own judgments and edits of intelligence .
Not only is work shifted towards the administration assessment that things are getting better , that the positive is n’t being reported , and the intelligence should optimistically reflect that , but the editorial pressure on the analysts never changes .
In her review of the book , Jill at Feministe describes a Rossmiller ’s narrative style particularly well .
AJ is skilled at never assigning motives to people , and never drawing hard and fast conclusions as to why things are going the way they are .
He writes like an analyst :
He observes what ’s happening , and then follows it up by giving several reasonable explanations as to why those things could be happening .
The dozens of anecdotes he tells certainly lead a halfway astute reader to understand exactly why certain events are occurring and why particular decisions are being made , but AJ has enough respect for his audience to simply present the facts as he sees them , rather than force a particular conclusion .
I think this is a very fitting description of how Rossmiller writes a narrative that reflects his experience while demonstrating his competence at presenting information factually , without obvious ideological bent .
That is , in many regards his book shows his skill as an analyst .
Do n’t get me wrong – I do n’t know what intelligence findings on Iraq from the DIA normally read like , but this book is fast paced and exciting .
Separate from the insight Rossmiller provides to the DIA ’s dysfunctional structure for handling intelligence and the challenges facing us in Iraq , Still Broken is a story of patriotism .
Rossmiller serves his country with distinction , doing good work that he deserves to be proud of for the rest of his life .
We ’re lucky to have him as a story - teller documenting the problems facing our intelligence community .
But beyond that , we ’re lucky to have his experience , expertise , and sharp analytical prowess working in the progressive political community , fighting for a better America .
I hope that this is n’t the most in - depth review of Still Broken that you read , but for whatever it ’s worth , I highly recommend you pick up a copy and give it a read .
Check out the StillBroken.com for more updates on the book .
NEW YORK ( Reuters Health ) - Coffee and tea lovers may have a slightly reduced risk of developing kidney cancer , research hints .
A waiter carries two cups of Turkish coffee at a coffee shop in Istanbul October 19 , 2007 .
REUTERS / Osman Orsal
The findings , based on an analysis of 13 previous studies , suggest that coffee and tea may be protective against kidney cancer , while milk , soda and juice seem to have no effect one way or the other .
Across the studies , people who drank three or more cups of coffee a day were 16 percent less likely to develop kidney cancer than those who averaged less than a cup per day .
And those who sipped just one 8 - ounce cup of tea each day had a 15 percent lower risk of the disease than non-drinkers .
The findings appear in the International Journal of Cancer .
While the study cannot show that coffee or tea directly lower kidney cancer risk , there are reasons why the beverages could be beneficial , according to the researchers , led by Dr. Jung Eun Lee of Harvard Medical School in Boston .
For example , they explain , coffee and tea may increase the body ’s sensitivity to the blood - sugar - regulating hormone insulin , and researchers suspect that insulin levels over time may affect kidney cancer risk .
Coffee and tea also contain antioxidant compounds that may help protect cells in the kidney from cancer - promoting damage , the researchers point out .
For their study , the investigators combined the results of 13 long - term studies that included a total of 530,469 women and 244,483 men .
Each study collected information on participants ’ diets at the outset and then followed them for seven to 20 years .
Coffee and tea consumption were linked to a lower risk of kidney cancer even when the researchers accounted for a number of factors known to affect people ’s risk of the disease -- such as obesity , smoking and high blood pressure .
“ Our results suggest that coffee and tea consumption may be associated with a modestly lower risk of ( kidney ) cancer , whereas intakes of milk , juice and soda were not associated with risk , ” Lee ’s team writes .
They say more studies are needed to understand why coffee and tea might be protective against the disease .

Opec President Chakib Khelil arriving for the meeting in Vienna
The head of Opec , the cartel of oil - producing nations , has said it is unlikely to increase production at this week 's meeting .
It had been hoped members would boost the supply of oil to help prices fall from their historically - high levels .
Crude oil hit a new record of almost $ 104 a barrel at the start of the week but settled at $ 99.52 late on Tuesday .
Oil ministers from Opec member nations are gathering in Vienna ahead of their meeting which starts on Wednesday .
" I do n't think Opec would consider increasing production because then we would be increasing to meet a demand that does n't exist , " Opec President Chakib Khelil said .
US government data , due on Wednesday , is expected to show it has a good supply of crude oil and domestic fuel .
US President George W Bush said it would be an error if Opec members did n't recognise the impact high prices were having on the US .
" I think it is a mistake to have your biggest customer 's economy to slow down .... as a result of high energy prices , " he said .
Earlier the International Energy Agency had said it favoured output to remain at current levels , even as supplies were tight .
Oil prices have risen to record highs due to high demand for the commodity and the weakening dollar , which has prompted investors to switch to oil and other reputed safe havens such as gold .

I do n’t know who came up with gift certificates , but they should receive an award for one of the best marketing jobs ever pulled on the unsuspecting public .
How else can you explain how people are willing to trade money , for a less useful and more restrictive form of money at a one - to - one ratio ?
For those of you who ca n’t think of what to buy your miserly Aunt Josie who does n’t seem to enjoy any material possessions or your nephew , John , who is involved in the next cult - like fad of card - collecting , baggy clothes or earsplitting music , avoid the temptation to get a gift certificate .
Here ’s why :
1 ) Gift certificates are like money , except less useful .
Money can be used everywhere .
Gift certificates can only be used with specific stores .
If the gift certificate offers some kind of special service or discount , this tradeoff might be reasonable .
However most gift certificates can’t be redeemed for cash , nor do they offer special treatment so buying one is essentially buying less useful money .
Advertising
2 ) Gift certificates are a mark of defeat .
When I ’ve given gift certificates in the past , the unstated words are , “ I give up . ”
A gift certificate is basically a sign that you could n’t think of an actual gift to give the person , so you will just let them pick it out for themselves .
If you want a gift that says , “ I do n’t know you well enough to pick out a gift , but I thought cash was tacky , ” get a gift certificate .
3 ) Gift certificates have expiry dates .
Not only are gift certificates a more restricted form of money , now some companies have the nerve to put an expiry date on them .
As if trading your money for less valuable money was n’t enough , now you get the bonus of having money that only lasts for a year or two .
Most stores wo n’t tell you about the expiry dates , but if you check the back most tell you that your less - valuable money will become completely useless after several months .
4 ) Gift certificates can backfire .
Advertising
The main argument for a gift certificate over cash , is that it shows at least some thought into preparation .
However , this can backfire if you get someone a certificate for a store they never shop at .
I ’m sure we ’ve all had the joy of running over to a store to use a gift certificate to buy an item we do n’t need , just to feel like we are n’t wasting it .
5 ) Gift certificates can cost your friends and family money .
When you give a gift certificate , often you are forcing them to pay some of their own money to use it .
A twenty - five dollar gift certificate is n’t a whole lot at some fancy outlets and technology stores .
You may be forcing your recipient to spend another ten or twenty dollars in order to use your wonderful gift .
How thoughtful !
6 ) Gift certificates get lost .
Many stores have started using gift cards instead of certificates .
These little devices magnetically store info about the dollar value they hold .
Despite the tracking of the gift certificate money electronically , you still need to have the card in order to use it .
That means that if your certificate gets lost , the money is gone forever .
At least you can deposit cash in the bank .
Advertising
7 ) Gift certificates have leftovers .
What actually costs exactly twenty - five or fifty dollars ?
Usually your lucky gift - card recipient will be left with a couple dollars on their card after buying a gift they probably did n’t really want for themselves .
This means your tradeoff for less valuable , expiring money loses an additional dollar or two .
8 ) Gift certificates mean a trip to the store .
Buying a real gift for someone says : “ I know you do n’t like to treat yourself , but I went to the trouble of getting something I know you ’ll like at a store to save you the visit . ”
A gift certificate is the do - it - yourself version of a gift , forcing the receiver to make a trip to whatever store you happened upon and spend hours driving , browsing and fumbling with the card .
9 ) Gift certificates do n’t earn interest .
Advertising
Okay , so twenty dollars in cash is n’t going to appreciate much in your 1 - 2 % annual interest savings account , but it ’s still more than your certificate .
Slowly losing the battle against inflation you can be happy knowing your gift becomes less and less valuable each day before it eventually gets lost or expires .
10 ) Gift certificates … are n’t all that bad .
I ’ve been giving gift certificates a hard time .
Despite their many flaws , sending cash is still a faux pas by many peoples standards .
And despite the lack of logic in preferring one to money , many people still do .
Many people actually prefer the colorful little cards to gifts if it means they do n’t have a choice at all .
Besides , when it is Christmas Eve and you still need to buy for a half - dozen more relatives , that card at the checkout counter starts to look a little more attractive .
Sure it is n’t as thoughtful as a hand wrapped gift complete with ribbon , but Hallmark cards are n’t as romantic as hand - written poetry , but nobody does that either .
You might just have to throw up your hands and give in to the brilliant marketing scheme that are gift certificates .
最新情報は Firefox 3 の目玉機能 第 2版をどうぞ。
そろそろ最終アルファ版が出そうな Firefox 3 ですが 、Firefox 3 の新機能から目玉機能的なものをピックアップしてみました。ほぼ同じコンセプトのMozilla
Links 日本語版 : Firefox 3 Alpha 8 レビューも参照してください。
新デフォルトテー マ
各プロットフォームでデフォルトのテーマの一新が予定されています（詳細）
フルページズーム（画像込みの拡大縮小）
Opera や IE7 のような画像込みで拡大縮小できるページズーム機能が搭載されます。今現在はまだ正式な
UI が実装されていないのですが、拡張機能を導入すれば使用することができます。新
UI は従来のテキストズームと機能の切り分けをどうするかまだ決まっていないようです。たとえば
CTRL ++ や CTRL +- にどちらの機能を割り当てるのか、そもそも両方をサポートするのか、、、。
Opera や IE ではページズーム機能だけが使用できるようになっていると思われますが、テキストズームも残して欲しいという希望が多いようです（私もその一人）。
長い url の自動改行、長いツールチップの自動改 行
長年 、Firefox ユーザの悩みの種であった長い url が折り返し表示されない問題が修正されました（テストケース、詳細）。また、長いツールチップスの自動改行もできるようになっています。
IME の制御
IME が ON の場合でもスペースキーでスクロール可能になりました。
ログイン後にパスワード保存の情報バーを表示
パスワード保存時の仕組みが変更になりました。従来は
ID とパスワード入力後、ページが切り替わる前にモーダルなパスワード保存ダイアログ（ダイアログを閉じるまで他の操作が行えない）が表示されていました。このため間違った
ID やパスワードが保存される可能性がありました。間違ったパスワードはあとで正しいパスワードを入力してログインすれば正しいものに置き換えてくれますが、間違った
ID は明示的に削除するまで自動補完候補に残ってしまいます。
Firefox 3 では従来のダイアログに変って、ページ上部の非モーダルな情報バーに置き換わりました。この情報バーはページ遷移後にも表示されているので、ログインできたときだけパスワードを保存させることができます。
プラグイン管 理
Flash や Java などのプラグインの管理がアドオンマネージャから行えるようになりました。現在はプラグインの無効化だけが利用できます。
アプリケーション管 理
外部アプリケーションの管理が一新されました。
タブバー周りの更新（アニメーション効果）
タブを閉じるときと、タブバーが横スクロールするときのアニメーション効果が実装されます（前者は今現在では本体には未実装）。
またタブのオーバーフロー時のスクロールボタンのダブルクリックで端まで一気にスクロールできるようになりました。このときもちゃんとアニメーションします。
コンテンツマネージ ャ
コンテンツマネージャによりサイトごとの設定を記憶させることができます。現在では文字サイズの拡大縮小だけが記憶されるようになっています。あるサイトで文字サイズを変更すると、同じサイトの別のタブにも変更した文字サイズが反映され、再起動後も継続されます。今のところ専用の
UI はありません 。
検索ボックスのリサイズ
ツールバーのアイテムに Resizer というのが追加になって、デフォルトではロケーションバーと検索ボックスの間に配置されます。このリサイザを左右にドラッグするとロケーションバーと検索ボックスの境界が移動され、結果的に検索ボックスを任意のサイズに変更できるようになります。
ブックマークと履 歴
ブックマークと履歴周りが大幅に更新されます。すでにバックエンドは
SQlite ベースのデータベースに変更されて、現在スターなど新しい
UI が徐々に実装されつつある段階です。
ロケーションバ ー
ロケーションバー周りもいろいろ変更が予定されています（詳細）。拡張機能の
Locationbar² がベースになっているのですが、一時実装されたドメイン名のハイライトが現在は無効になっているなど、最終的にどのような形になるかはまだ良く見えない状況です。
ダウンロードマネージャの更新
ダウンロードマネージャの UI が更新されています 。
ページ情報の更 新
ページ情報の UI が更新されています 。
色管理システ ム( CMS ) への対応
Firefox でもカラーマネジメント （CMS ）が利用できるようになりましたが、デフォルトでは無効にされています（詳細）。
カラーマネジメントの効果の確認は Mozilla
Links で紹介されている ICC のテストページでできます（若干重いです）。上の4分割された風景写真が正常に表示されれば
OK です。
APNG のサポー ト
PNG のアニメーション版である APNG がサポートされます（詳細）。下の画像は APNG をサポートしていない Firefox 2 などのブラウザでは静止画に見えます（最初のフレームだけが表示される）。
contentEditable のサポー ト
contentEditable というのは IE5.5 からサポートされたようで、div に contentEditable =" true " とか書いておくとその要素がブラウザ上で編集可能になるというものです（詳細）。以下に簡単なサンプルをのせました。
このパラグラフと下のリストだけは編集可能にしています。
Mozilla Firefox Thunderbird
ftp ディレクトリページの更 新
ftp:// や file:// によるディレクトリ表示が以前よりはきれいにフォーマットされて表示されるようになります。
オフライン機 能
ウェブアプリケーションをオフラインで動作させるための仕組みが提供されます（詳細）。これは
Google から既にベータ版がリリースされている Google Gears で使用されているものとは別のものです 。
Acid2 対応
Acid2 に対応しました 。
Microformat
Microformat がサポートされるかどうかは微妙なところのようです。

A number of readers let us know about the Chaos Computer Club 's latest caper : they published the fingerprint of German Secretary of the Interior Wolfgang Schäuble ( link is to a Google translation of the German original ) .
The club has been active in opposition to Germany 's increasing push to use biometrics in , for example , e-passports .
Someone friendly to the club 's aims captured Schäuble 's fingerprint from a glass he drank from at a panel discussion .
The club published 4,000 copies of their magazine Die Datenschleuder including a plastic foil reproducing the minister 's fingerprint — ready to glue to someone else 's finger to provide a false biometric reading .
The CCC has a page on their site detailing how to make such a fake fingerprint .
The article says a ministry spokesman alluded to possible legal action against the club .
Olbermann aims ' Special Comment ' at Clinton campaign David Edwards and Mike Sheehan
Published : Wednesday March 12 , 2008

Print This Email This MSNBC's Keith Olbermann for the first time turned his " Special Comment " sights on a Democrat : Sen. Hillary Clinton .
Olbermann pulled no punches in a withering attack on events surrounding the Clinton campaign in recent days regarding Geraldine Ferraro 's controversial statements about Sen. Barack Obama and race .
" I have fought with myself over whether or not to say anything , " Olbermann begins tentatively , before saying , " Events insist . "
Directly addressing Clinton , Olbermann says , " [ A ] s it has reached its apex in their tone - deaf , arrogant and insensitive reaction to the remarks of Geraldine Ferraro , your own advisors are slowly killing your chances to become president .
" Senator , their words and your own are now slowly killing the chances for any Democrat to become president , " he continued .
" In your tepid response to this Ferraro disaster , you may sincerely think you are disenthralling an enchanted media and righting an unfair advance bestowed on Sen. Obama .
You may think the matter has closed with Rep.
Ferraro 's bitter , almost threatening resignation letter , but in fact , senator , you are now campaigning as if Barack Obama were the Democrat and you were the Republican . "
Olbermann said of former vice presidential candidate Ferraro , who stepped down from the Clinton campaign today after days in the spotlight , " [ S ] he was ... dismissing Sen .
Obama 's candidacy as nothing more than some equal - opportunity stunt . "
Olbermann warned that by associating her campaign with the " cheap , ignorant , vile racism that underlies every syllable " of Ferraro 's resignation letter , Clinton was hurting herself .
" Senator Clinton , " said Olbermann , " this is not a campaign strategy .
This is a suicide pact .
" This week alone , " he added , " your so - called strategists have declared that Sen .
Obama has not yet crossed some ' Commander - in - Chief threshold , ' but he might still be your choice to be vice president .
... A midterm succession , but you only pick him if he crosses that threshold by the time of the convention , but if he does ... , he will only have done so sufficiently enough to become vice president , not president .
" Senator , if the serpentine logic of your so - called advisers were not bad enough , now thanks to Geraldine Ferraro and ... your new relationship with her , ... if you were to seek Obama as a vice president , it would be to Ms. Ferraro some kind of social - engineering gesture ... "
Olbermann continued , " Her only reaction has been to brand herself as the victim and resign from your committee and insist she will continue to speak .
Unless , Senator , you say something definitive , the former congresswoman is speaking with your approval .
" You must remedy this , and you must reject and denounce Geraldine Ferraro , " he concluded .
Amazon removes the database scaling wall Saturday , December 15 , 2007 by Dave Winer .
When Amazon introduced S3 in March 2006
I knew I would use it and I was sure a lot of other developers would .
I saw it as a solution to a problem we all have -- storage that scales up when needed , and scales down when not .
Otherwise we all have to buy as much bandwidth as we need in peak periods .
With S3 , you pay for what you use .
It makes storage for Internet services more rational .
Later they did the same for processors and queuing .
And a couple of days ago they announced a lightweight scalable database , using the same on - demand philosophy and simple architecture and API .
It 's going to be a huge hit and forever change the way apps are developed for the Internet .
I was explaining the significance of this to Scoble on the phone this morning .
It 's worth repeating here .
When I developed Frontier in the late 80s and early 90s my target platform was a modern desktop computer , a few megabytes of RAM , a half - gig of disk , a few megahertz CPU .
A system capable of running Quark XPress , Hypercard or Filemaker .
It would be used to develop apps that would drive desktop publishing .
Later , it was used to generate static websites , then a demonstration of democracy ( a multi- author ultra - simple CMS ) , then news sites , which became weblogs , then blogs , and editthispage.com , Manila , weblogs.com , and that 's when scaling became an issue .
( Later we side - stepped the scaling issue by moving most of the processing to the desktop with Radio 8 . )
As we approached then cracked ease of use in web authoring , scaling became an issue , then the issue .
A Manila server would work fine for a few thousand sites , but after that it would bog down because the architecture could n't escape the confines of a single machine it was designed for in the 80s .
( Before you say it 's obsolete , there still are a lot of apps for single machines .
Perl , Python , JavaScript and Java share the same design philosophy . )
Same with weblogs.com .
It worked great when there were a few thousand blogs .
Once we hit 50 K or so , we had to come up with a new design .
Eventually we were tracking a couple million , and Frontier was hopelessy outclassed by the size of the problem .
If only Amazon 's database had been there , both Manila and weblogs.com could have been redesigned to keep up .
It would have been a huge programming task for Manila , but it would have made it economically possible .
Today , when a company raises VC , it 's probably because their app has achieved a certain amount of success and to get to the next level of users they need to spend serious money on infrastruture .
There 's a serious economic and human wall here .
You need to buy hardware and find the people who know how to make a database scale .
The latter is the hard problem , the people are scarce and the big companies are bidding up the price for their time .
Now Amazon is willing to sell you that , to turn this scarce thing into a commodity , at what likely is a very reasonable price .
( Have n't had time to analyze this yet , but the other services are . )
Key point , the wall is gone , replaced with a ramp .
If you coded your database in Amazon to begin with you will never see the wall .
As you need more capacity you have to do nothing , other than pay your bill .
Further , the design of Amazon 's database is remarkably like the internal data structures of modern programming languages .
Very much like a hash or a dictionary ( what Perl and Python call these structures ) or Frontier 's tables , but unlike them , you can have multiple values with the same name .
In this way it 's like XML .
I imagine all languages have had to accomodate this feature of XML ( we did in Frontier ) , so they should all map pretty well on Amazon 's structure .
This was gutsy , and I think smart .
They 're going down a road we went down with XML - RPC and then SOAP .
There may be some bumps along the way but there are no dead - ends , no deal - stoppers .
All major environments can be adapted to work with this data structure , unless I 'm missing something ( standard disclaimers apply ) .
Their move makes many things possible .
As I said earlier , if it existed when we had to scale weblogs.com , we would certainly have used it .
One could build an open identity system on it , probably in an afternoon , it would be perfect for that .
A Twitter - like messaging system , again , would be easy .
It 's amazing that Microsoft and Google are sitting by and letting Amazon take all this ground in developer - land without even a hint of a response .
It seems likely they have something in the works .
Let 's hope there 's some compatibility .

RS : If you were a historian , how would you describe the Bush administration from that point of view ?
Gore :
They have done so much damage to the spirit of America , to the worldwide reputation of America , to the morale of our people , to the core belief that we 're capable of managing our fears without sacrificing our freedom .
But nobody 's going to be surprised to hear me give a thumbs - down rating to Bush and Cheney .
RS : What 's the worst damage they 've done , other than the climate crisis ?
Gore :
They have promoted the idea that freedom and security are mutually exclusive , that you can have one only to the extent that you 've sacrificed the other .
That is an un-American idea .
When our founders framed the Constitution , they understood the reality of war .
When the Declaration of Independence was written , it was written by Americans who were in danger of being hung .
They had reason to fear for their very lives , every single one of them , but they insisted on the protection of habeas corpus and freedom of speech and freedom of the press and freedom of assembly and freedom of religion , and the separation of self - government from the establishment of a religious dogma as an official set of beliefs .
They had real courage that bridged their devotion to freedom and their need for security .
But instead of courage , this administration has used fear to undermine the system of checks and balances and the carefully balanced relationship between separate branches of government and the principle that all of the operations of our self - government should be accountable to the people .
The arrogance and unaccountability of absolute power is corrupting , and our founders knew that so well .
They embodied in our nation a universal principle derived from a millennium and a half of history , from Athens to Rome through the Enlightenment to the American Revolution .
But all of that has been blithely ignored by this administration because of their lust for power .
This has got to be the most trenchant and spot - on criticism that anyone has leveled at this administration .
Succinctly stated , it encompasses and indicts a whole host of offenses , from the moral travesty that is the Iraq War , to the suspension of habeas corpus , to the so - called PATRIOT acts , to Guantanamo Bay and torture , et al .
Sure , our leading candidates have made broad critiques that explain why Bush 's policies are bad for America , harmful to the middle class , etc .
But it 's this historical context that reveals the actions of the Bush Administration and its apologists ( Rudy McRomney ) to be at best the epitome of weakness , and at worst , a predatory perversion of the American idea .
Gore added :
It 's not just the excesses of Bush and Cheney -- it 's the failure of our Congress , our courts , our free press , and all of us , to speak up and prevent this degradation of the American idea .
Right on .
I do n't know about you , but the decision of Sens. Schumer and Feinstein to support Michael Mukasey for Attorney General is the last straw for me .
I give up on this Democratic congress , because as Gore points out , they have placed political calculus above bedrock principles that deserve to be fought for , win or lose .
And then they wonder why Americans do n't know what the Democrats stand for .
So my hopes rest with our next president .
And he / she will not unite the country and restore the American idea by exploiting divisions to win with 51 % of the vote .
Rather , they will need to appeal to independents and non-fascist Republicans by offering this kind of devastating strategic frame .
The question is , do we share Gore 's concern , and will we nominate a candidate who can do that ?
Read the previous DKos diary , which covers Gore 's thoughts on climate change and a presidential run .
Or read the entire article here , starting on page 54 .
Should we expect rationality to be , on some level , simple ?
Should we search and hope for underlying beauty in the arts of belief and choice ?
Let me introduce this issue by borrowing a complaint of the late great Bayesian Master , E. T. Jaynes ( 1990 ) :
" Two medical researchers use the same treatment independently , in different hospitals .
Neither would stoop to falsifying the data , but one had decided beforehand that because of finite resources he would stop after treating N=100 patients , however many cures were observed by then .
The other had staked his reputation on the efficacy of the treatment , and decided he would not stop until he had data indicating a rate of cures definitely greater than 60 % , however many patients that might require .
But in fact , both stopped with exactly the same data : n = 100 [ patients ] , r = 70 [ cures ] .
Should we then draw different conclusions from their experiments ? "
( Presumably the two control groups also had equal results . )
According to old - fashioned statistical procedure - which I believe is still being taught today - the two researchers have performed different experiments with different stopping conditions .
The two experiments could have terminated with different data , and therefore represent different tests of the hypothesis , requiring different statistical analyses .
It 's quite possible that the first experiment will be " statistically significant " , the second not .
Whether or not you are disturbed by this says a good deal about your attitude toward probability theory , and indeed , rationality itself .
Non-Bayesian statisticians might shrug , saying , " Well , not all statistical tools have the same strengths and weaknesses , y' know - a hammer is n't like a screwdriver - and if you apply different statistical tools you may get different results , just like using the same data to compute a linear regression or train a regularized neural network .
You 've got to use the right tool for the occasion .
Life is messy -"
And then there 's the Bayesian reply : " Excuse you ?
The evidential impact of a fixed experimental method , producing the same data , depends on the researcher 's private thoughts ?
And you have the nerve to accuse us of being ' too subjective ' ? "
If Nature is one way , the likelihood of the data coming out the way we have seen will be one thing .
If Nature is another way , the likelihood of the data coming out that way will be something else .
But the likelihood of a given state of Nature producing the data we have seen , has nothing to do with the researcher 's private intentions .
So whatever our hypotheses about Nature , the likelihood ratio is the same , and the evidential impact is the same , and the posterior belief should be the same , between the two experiments .
At least one of the two Old Style methods must discard relevant information - or simply do the wrong calculation - for the two methods to arrive at different answers .
The ancient war between the Bayesians and the accursèd frequentists stretches back through decades , and I 'm not going to try to recount that elder history in this blog post .
But one of the central conflicts is that Bayesians expect probability theory to be ... what 's the word I 'm looking for ?
" Neat ? " " Clean ? " " Self - consistent ? "
As Jaynes says , the theorems of Bayesian probability are just that , theorems in a coherent proof system .
No matter what derivations you use , in what order , the results of Bayesian probability theory should always be consistent - every theorem compatible with every other theorem .
If you want to know the sum of 10 + 10 , you can redefine it as ( 2 * 5 ) + ( 7 + 3 ) or as ( 2 * ( 4 + 6 ) ) or use whatever other legal tricks you like , but the result always has to come out to be the same , in this case , 20 .
If it comes out as 20 one way and 19 the other way , then you may conclude you did something illegal on at least one of the two occasions .
( In arithmetic , the illegal operation is usually division by zero ; in probability theory , it is usually an infinity that was not taken as a the limit of a finite process . )
If you get the result 19 = 20 , look hard for that error you just made , because it 's unlikely that you 've sent arithmetic itself up in smoke .
If anyone should ever succeed in deriving a real contradiction from Bayesian probability theory - like , say , two different evidential impacts from the same experimental method yielding the same results - then the whole edifice goes up in smoke .
Along with set theory , ' cause I 'm pretty sure ZF provides a model for probability theory .
Math !
That 's the word I was looking for .
Bayesians expect probability theory to be math .
That 's why we 're interested in Cox 's Theorem and its many extensions , showing that any representation of uncertainty which obeys certain constraints has to map onto probability theory .
Coherent math is great , but unique math is even better .
And yet ... should rationality be math ?
It is by no means a foregone conclusion that probability should be pretty .
The real world is messy - so should n't you need messy reasoning to handle it ?
Maybe the non-Bayesian statisticians , with their vast collection of ad - hoc methods and ad - hoc justifications , are strictly more competent because they have a strictly larger toolbox .
It 's nice when problems are clean , but they usually are n't , and you have to live with that .
After all , it 's a well - known fact that you can't use Bayesian methods on many problems because the Bayesian calculation is computationally intractable .
So why not let many flowers bloom ?
Why not have more than one tool in your toolbox ?
That 's the fundamental difference in mindset .
Old School statisticians thought in terms of tools , tricks to throw at particular problems .
Bayesians - at least this Bayesian , though I do n't think I 'm speaking only for myself - we think in terms of laws .
Looking for laws is n't the same as looking for especially neat and pretty tools .
The second law of thermodynamics is n't an especially neat and pretty refrigerator .
The Carnot cycle is an ideal engine - in fact , the ideal engine .
No engine powered by two heat reservoirs can be more efficient than a Carnot engine .
As a corollary , all thermodynamically reversible engines operating between the same heat reservoirs are equally efficient .
But , of course , you can't use a Carnot engine to power a real car .
A real car 's engine bears the same resemblance to a Carnot engine that the car 's tires bear to perfect rolling cylinders .
Clearly , then , a Carnot engine is a useless tool for building a real - world car .
The second law of thermodynamics , obviously , is not applicable here .
It 's too hard to make an engine that obeys it , in the real world .
Just ignore thermodynamics - use whatever works .
This is the sort of confusion that I think reigns over they who still cling to the Old Ways .
No , you can't always do the exact Bayesian calculation for a problem .
Sometimes you must seek an approximation ; often , indeed .
This does n't mean that probability theory has ceased to apply , any more than your inability to calculate the aerodynamics of a 747 on an atom - by - atom basis implies that the 747 is not made out of atoms .
Whatever approximation you use , it works to the extent that it approximates the ideal Bayesian calculation - and fails to the extent that it departs .
Bayesianism 's coherence and uniqueness proofs cut both ways .
Just as any calculation that obeys
Cox 's coherency axioms ( or any of the many reformulations and generalizations ) must map onto probabilities , so too , anything that is not Bayesian must fail one of the coherency tests .
This , in turn , opens you to punishments like Dutch - booking ( accepting combinations of bets that are sure losses , or rejecting combinations of bets that are sure gains ) .
You may not be able to compute the optimal answer .
But whatever approximation you use , both its failures and successes will be explainable in terms of Bayesian probability theory .
You may not know the explanation ; that does not mean no explanation exists .
So you want to use a linear regression , instead of doing Bayesian updates ?
But look to the underlying structure of the linear regression , and you see that it corresponds to picking the best point estimate given a Gaussian likelihood function and a uniform prior over the parameters .
You want to use a regularized linear regression , because that works better in practice ?
Well , that corresponds ( says the Bayesian ) to having a Gaussian prior over the weights .
Sometimes you can't use Bayesian methods literally ; often , indeed .
But when you can use the exact Bayesian calculation that uses every scrap of available knowledge , you are done .
You will never find a statistical method that yields a better answer .
You may find a cheap approximation that works excellently nearly all the time , and it will be cheaper , but it will not be more accurate .
Not unless the other method uses knowledge , perhaps in the form of disguised prior information , that you are not allowing into the Bayesian calculation ; and then when you feed the prior information into the Bayesian calculation , the Bayesian calculation will again be equal or superior .
When you use an Old Style ad - hoc statistical tool with an ad - hoc ( but often quite interesting ) justification , you never know if someone else will come up with an even more clever tool tomorrow .
But when you can directly use a calculation that mirrors the Bayesian law , you 're done - like managing to put a Carnot heat engine into your car .
It is , as the saying goes , " Bayes - optimal " .
It seems to me that the toolboxers are looking at the sequence of cubes { 1 , 8 , 27 , 64 , 125 , ...} and pointing to the first differences { 7 , 19 , 37 , 61 , ...} and saying " Look , life is n't always so neat - you 've got to adapt to circumstances . "
And the Bayesians are pointing to the third differences , the underlying stable level { 6 , 6 , 6 , 6 , 6 , ...} .
And the critics are saying , " What the heck are you talking about ?
It 's 7 , 19 , 37 not 6 , 6 , 6 .
You are oversimplifying this messy problem ; you are too attached to simplicity . "
It 's not necessarily simple on a surface level .
You have to dive deeper than that to find stability .
Think laws , not tools .
Needing to calculate approximations to a law does n't change the law .
Planes are still atoms , they are n't governed by special exceptions in Nature for aerodynamic calculations .
The approximation exists in the map , not in the territory .
You can know the second law of thermodynamics , and yet apply yourself as an engineer to build an imperfect car engine .
The second law does not cease to be applicable ; your knowledge of that law , and of Carnot cycles , helps you get as close to the ideal efficiency as you can .
We are n't enchanted by Bayesian methods merely because they 're beautiful .
The beauty is a side effect .
Bayesian theorems are elegant , coherent , optimal , and provably unique because they are laws .

Earlier this month , the culture and justice ministers in Sweden announced that courts would soon be able to demand ISPs give copyright owners information about suspected file sharers .
While legal music downloads are on the rise , this has not been enough to offset falls in CD sales , which the music industry blames on piracy .
It also believes ISPs are responsible for ensuring their users do not use their internet services for illegal activities .
Exetel 's modified notice and disconnect system , which executive Steve Waddington said in a blog post had been operating for two years , prevents users who have been fingered as copyright infringers by a " recognised industry source or their legal representatives " from browsing any web pages .
The user can still send and receive email but cannot surf the web until they resolve the issue with the issuer of the infringement notice , which in many cases is the anti-piracy watchdog of the local music industry , Music Industry Piracy Investigations ( MIPI ) .
And in a departure from MIPI 's proposed system , instead of summarily disconnecting illegal downloaders , Exetel instead simply blocks their web surfing and gives the user the option of terminating their service if the issue can't be resolved .
Waddington said Exetel had already received emails from outraged customers looking to switch providers as a result of its piracy crackdown .
But while MIPI may have succeeded in convincing Exetel to crack down on infringers , the idea has been rejected outright by the ISP industry body , the Internet Industry Association ( IIA ) .
" At this stage there has been little movement from the [ local ] ISPs , however in light of the sea change that is occurring internationally we are hopeful that ISPs in Australia will voluntarily implement the scheme , " MIPI general manager Sabiene Heindl said .
" We would prefer not to take legal action against individual file sharers or ISPs in Australia and remain committed to a negotiated code of conduct . "
The IIA insists the proposal is problematic and unnecessary , saying ISPs should not be required to police the actions of their users or adjudicate on whether or not a person is infringing copyright .
It feels there are already adequate procedures and remedies available to copyright holders through the courts and the Copyright Act .
Peter Coroneos , chief executive of the IIA , has said Australian ISPs are looking for a proposal that does n't involve threatening and intimidating users .
He said the music industry should instead focus its efforts on understanding why people steal music in the first place and provide a cheaper way for people to obtain tracks legally .
DAYTON , Ohio – Honda Motor Co. plans to stop producing motorcycles in the United States next year , ending production at its first U.S. plant and transferring it to Japan , the automaker announced Wednesday .
The plant , in Marysville , Ohio , employs 450 workers .
Honda said there will be no layoffs when production ends in spring 2009 .
The workers will remain with the company , helping produce cars , trucks , engines and parts and filling other jobs at Honda 's operations in west - central Ohio , the company said .
" There were a lot of people who felt disappointment , " said plant manager Jan Gansheimer , noting that many of the employees are motorcycle enthusiasts who have spent much of their careers at the plant .
Knowing it was a business decision and that they would not lose their jobs made it easier to accept , she said .
Gansheimer said ending production at the plant , which opened in 1979 , was a difficult decision because it was Honda 's first in the U.S .
Last year , the plant produced about 44,000 Gold Wing touring and VTX cruiser bikes .
Gansheimer said production of 120 motorcycles a day will continue for now .
A decision on whether to phase out production and transfer workers gradually or do it all at once has not been made .
Honda said motorcycle production at the Marysville plant and at the Hamamatsu factory in Japan will be consolidated at an expanded motorcycle plant in Kumamoto , Japan , in 2009 .
It is part of a global plan to produce certain larger motorcycles , Honda said .
" This move allows us to improve the competitiveness and appeal of our products by applying the latest technologies and production systems at one efficient location , " said Akio Hamada , president and chief executive of Honda of America .
The Japanese plant will be capable of producing up to 600,000 motorcycles a year .
Capacity at the Marysville plant is 75,000 .
No decision has been made about what to do with the Marysville plant .
Honda currently employs about 13,000 workers at five plants in Ohio – two in Marysville and one each in East Liberty , Anna and Russells Point .
Besides motorcycles , the employees make the Accord , Civic , Element , CR - V , Acura TL and RDX sport utility vehicle .

Their members have voted and MoveOn has come out in support of Barack Obama :
With hundreds of thousands of ballots cast across the country , for the first time in MoveOn 's history , we 've voted together to endorse a presidential candidate in the primary .
That candidate is Barack Obama .
We know how to roll up our sleeves and win elections , and if we all pitch in together between now and Tuesday , we can help Sen.
Obama win the biggest primary day in American history .
To be clear , we wo n't always agree with all of Obama 's positions .
And MoveOn members said overwhelmingly that , regardless of who wins the Democratic nomination , we 'll work hard to win the White House in 2008 .
Whatever happens in the primary , we 'll push the Democratic nominee to campaign progressively and then we 'll push them to fulfill their promises after they win ... read on
A high court in Nigeria 's northern Kano state has ordered the arrest of the boss of the Nigerian subsidiary of Pfizer International , Ngozi Edozien , and two other officials of the company , Larry Barry and Segun Duro , for failing to honour the court 's summons , over the case of illegal administration of a meningitis drug on 200 children in the state in 1996 , the local media reported Tuesday .
The presiding judge , Shehu Atiku said it is evident that three of the accused have actually been served with summons to appear before the court on November 6 , 2007 but until this time none of them has appeared before the court either out of neglect or disrespect of court or contempt , he said before he issued the warrant of arrest and adjourned the case to January 29 , 2008 .
Issuing the warrant of arrest against the officials Monday , Justice Shehu Atiku ruled they were in contempt of the court .
The state government has filed a criminal suit against the international drugs company for causing the death of 11 children and various degrees of impairment to many others , by administering the unapproved drug , Trovan , on the kids during an outbreak of meningitis in the state in 1996 .
The criminal case has been deadlocked over non- appearance of the accused without which the criminal proceedings cannot commence .
The judge was constrained from issuing arrest warrant to Pfizer International Incorporated by the motion its counsel Nelson Ezuegbu filed challenging the court ’s jurisdiction .
“ Pfizer International Incorporated having filed a motion challenging the jurisdiction of this court is exempted from the bench warrant ” , Atiku said .
The prosecution accused the three accused of delaying proceedings by assigning a lawyer to sign the acceptance of the summons issued them and filing a suit against the policeman who served them before a Lagos state High Court challenging the Kano High Court ’s jurisdiction and demanding for $ 5 billion damages for the alleged breach of their fundamental human rights .
In the criminal case , Kano state government had accused Pfizer of conspiracy , culpable homicide and causing grave harm to the victims of the alleged drug trial .
Hearing in the case , which has attracted international attention , has been adjourned till 29 January 2008 .
On uniqueness and being different
December 22 , 2007 at 1:00 am thinkingshift
You know , I sometimes wonder if it ’s just me worrying about ongoing attacks on our privacy and CCTV cameras glaring down on us .
One of my friends turns glassy - eyed whenever I begin a rant on CCTV cameras and tells me to “ move on ” ( to where I ’m never sure ) .
And Dave Snowden recently commented that he thought I was overly - worried .
I respect Dave tremendously – I think the KM world would have been much duller without his intellect and passion .
And the comments he received on his blog raised some extremely interesting issues for me .
So I ’m going to spend Xmas pondering and a future post will have a hopefully measured response .
I ’m particularly interested to explore Dave ’s comment on CCTV being necessary “ to preserve democracy ” .
And also to expand on my thoughts about how CCTV for me is a surface manifestation of something else going on in our society that is much deeper , more subterranean .
But in the meantime …
I ’ve noticed over the past few months that more and more reports and articles are appearing on the surveillance society and I ’m hoping people are beginning to wake up and think “ hey , enough ” .
So I was very pleased to come across an article entitled Uniqueness lost in Surveillance Society .
Because that ’s what it ’s all about to me .
Freedom means being able to be who you are and express who you are but freedom also implies that anonymity will be respected .
With anonymity you get an open society in which citizens can move about freely in public spaces .
But when a society is surveillance - saturated then you get conformity and oppression .
If you look different , you get singled out for a frisk down at an airport .
Clearly , I must look a bit suspicious or different because the last 4 times I ’ve gone through x-ray machines at various airports , although I have n’t set them off , I ’ve then been asked to step aside to have a test that would show residue on my clothes ( from chemicals used to make bombs ) .
So this journal article makes some sensible observations .
Surveillance , monitoring and eavesdropping is changing our culture , affecting people ’s behaviour and altering our sense of freedom and anonymity .
And the pressure to conform is becoming the norm .
Why do n’t we rise up and refuse to be surveilled I ask ?
A few days ago , I bought something from eBay .
I needed to contact the seller who had n’t responded to my emails , so I rang the contact number given .
I asked if they were Joe Blogs who was selling a camera on eBay .
Instead of “ no , not me ” .
I was met with a barrage of suspicious questions like “ why are you asking ? ” ; “ who are you ? ” .
I apologised as clearly I ’d dialed the wrong number but get this : the person rings me back 15 minutes later to say they ’re ringing the police because they thought my call was suspicious and I was met with a torrent of abuse .
Leaving aside the very distinct possibility that this person was a whacko , I almost had to laugh at the absurdity if it was n’t for the fact that we ’re in the grip of a fear based , anxious society that makes our fellow citizens skittish .
Jeffrey Rosen is a law professor and he is quoted in the article as saying : “ While there are benefits to surveillance – the sense of security , the ability to view crime scenes – the loss of autonomy represents the downside of our surveillance - heavy culture .
You need a sphere of immunity from surveillance to be yourself and do things that people in a free society take for granted .
Things like going to the park or to the market .
The loss of such autonomy is one of the “ amorphous costs of having a world where there ’s no immunity from surveillance .
This will transform the nature of public spaces in ways we could hardly imagine .
People obviously behave differently when they ’re unsure about whether they ’re being observed “ .
Clever dude .
And what are all these surveillance cameras and security measures looking for ?
Anyone who is different or unique in some way .
( I ’m not suggesting that real terrorists are n’t caught in the net occasionally ) .
There ’s a code of conduct that is enforced on us .
We do n’t joke at airports about bombs .
We ’re being urged to be surveillants and report anything suspicious .
Shoshana Zuboff , a Harvard social psychologist , refers to “ anticipatory conformity ” – we anticipate what we should n’t do and so avoid getting singled out in public like I was hauled aside at an airport recently .
And the problem with this ?
If anticipatory conformity becomes second nature to us and we accept long security lines at airports , it makes it easier for our privacy and freedom to be impinged on .
Because anticipatory conformity becomes a habit .
And if you want to understand just what little price the Australian Government places on privacy then consider the sorry case of a woman who was buying baby clothes at a Target store in Burwood NSW .
She was accused of stealing a packet of razors and dragged back into the store ( literally ) , punched and ….. strip - searched … before being allowed to leave .
She was never arrested or charged .
The poor woman , being yelled at by a security guard who failed to identify himself , emptied her bag to show she had no packet of razors but she was still dragged off .
Needless to say , she was publicly humiliated and embarrassed in front of customers and staff .
This is unlawful detention at its worst in a so - called democratic society .
Where were the CCTV cameras watching over this incident I ask ( apparently there was a denial that surveillance equipment existed in the store ) .
And the damages awarded to the poor woman ?
$ 85,000 including $ 25,000 in punitive damages .
Just another court case resolved but should n’t we be asking some very serious questions about a society , which allows this shocking incident to happen in the first place ?

“ It reminds me of Iraq under Saddam , ” a militant opponent of Saddam Hussein said angrily to me last week as he watched red-capped Iraqi soldiers close down part of central Baghdad so the convoy of Nouri al - Maliki , the Iraqi prime minister , might briefly venture into the city .
Five years after the invasion of Iraq , the U.S. and Iraqi governments claim that the country is becoming a less dangerous place , but the measures taken to protect Maliki told a different story .
Gun-waving soldiers first cleared all traffic from the streets .
Then four black armored cars , each with three machine - gunners on the roof , raced out of the Green Zone through a heavily fortified exit , followed by sand - colored American Humvees and more armored cars .
Finally , in the middle of the speeding convoy , we saw six identical bulletproof vehicles with black windows , one of which must have been carrying Maliki .
The precautions were not excessive , since Baghdad remains the most dangerous city in the world .
The Iraqi prime minister was only going to the headquarters of the Dawa party , to which he belongs and which are just half a mile outside the Green Zone , but his hundreds of security guards acted as if they were entering enemy territory .
Five years of occupation have destroyed Iraq as a country .
Baghdad is today a collection of hostile Sunni and Shiite ghettoes divided by high concrete walls .
Different districts even have different national flags .
Sunni areas use the old Iraqi flag with the three stars of the Baath party , and the Shiite wave a newer version , adopted by the Shiite - Kurdish government .
The Kurds have their own flag .
The Iraqi government tries to give the impression that normality is returning .
Iraqi journalists are told not to mention the continuing violence .
When a bomb exploded in Karada district near my hotel , killing 70 people , the police beat and drove away a television cameraman trying to take pictures of the devastation .
Civilian casualties have fallen from 65 Iraqis killed daily from November 2006 to August 2007 to 26 daily in February .
But the fall in the death rate is partly because ethnic cleansing has already done its grim work and in much of Baghdad there are no mixed areas left .

Shugo and I are happy to announce the release of ruby - prof 0.6.0 .
If you have n’t used ruby - prof , its a superfast , open - source , profiler for Ruby that shows you where your program is slow .
The big news is that this release , thanks to Shugo , supports Ruby 1.9 .
And there is talk about merging ruby - prof into Ruby itself , but we ’ll have to wait and see if that really happens .
This release also includes experimental support for memory profiling , added by Alexander Dymo , which I ’ll talk about in more detail below .
And of course it includes a number of bug fixes , almost all of which were reported and fixed by the community .
Special thanks goes out to Sylvain Joyeux , Michael Granger , Makoto Kuwata and Dan Fitch .
The best way to get started with ruby - prof is to look at the readme file which is online at RubyForge .
Memory Profiling
The 0.5.0 release introduced the concept of measurement modes , which offer a way of extending ruby - prof to track all sorts of metrics about a running program , including time , object allocations , memory usage , etc .
Developers can implement custom measurement modes by simply implementing a measurement function that tracks the metric of interest , and ruby - prof takes care of all the rest .
The idea was inspired by Sylvain Joyeux , who used it in the 0.5.0 release to track object allocations in a running program .
In this release , Alexander Dymo added support for tracking memory allocations as I discussed in my last post .
The only disadvantage of these two measurement modes is that they require patched ruby interpreters , making them unavailable to most ruby developers .
Tracking memory usage is particularly important , and there has been some great work done by Evan Weaver with BleakHouse , Erick Hodel with mem_inspect and Alexander Dymo .
I ’m not partial to any of these approaches , outside the fact they should be implemented in C for performance reasons .
But I would like to see a single solution which could be merged into Ruby itself , opening it up to all Ruby developers .
I ’ve asked Alexander to start up a discussion on ruby - core , so we ’ll see where it leads .
Is Tijuana safe for Americans ?
Mexican kidnappers are getting more organized and honing in on Americans visiting tourist hot - spots in Mexico .
The State Department cautions US citizens to be more careful and vigilant about their own safety when visiting Mexico .
" We have no power to get anyone out of jail or to represent anyone in a criminal proceeding if they get in trouble , " said Steve Royster , a spokesperson for the US consulate 's office .
A " warden message " was issued last month to all Americans , warning that kidnappings in Mexico have doubled since 2006 .
Though some of the victims were returned home , many were brutally tortured during ransom negotiations .
" The brutality that is inflicted on some of these people is unconscionable , " FBI agent , Keith Slotter told CNN .
Police say potential kidnappers target tourist areas where they 're more likely to find someone driving a nice car , shopping in expensive stores - people they think can afford a healthy ransom .
The kidnappings appear to be random , but a few common sense rules can help keep you safe :
Trust your instincts :
If you feel like you 're being followed or targeted , act .
Get yourself to a public area where it 's much harder to quietly whisk someone away .
Chaperone yourself :
If you 're going to drink , do it at your hotel or resort rather than out on the town .
There 's less risk of attack steps away from your room .
Use the buddy system : Never wander into unfamiliar areas alone .
Disrupt the plan :
If you 're in a crowded area with lots of people around , yell words like " FIRE . "
Make a scene , bite , break things - anything you can do to attract attention .
Planning to head to Mexico , despite the warnings ?
How do you plan to stay safe ?
( CNN ) --
An undersea cable carrying Internet traffic was cut off the Persian Gulf emirate of Dubai , officials said Friday , the third loss of a line carrying Internet and telephone traffic in three days .
Dubai has been hit hard by an Internet outage apparently caused by a cut undersea cable .
Ships have been dispatched to repair two undersea cables damaged on Wednesday off Egypt .
FLAG Telecom , which owns one of the cables , said repairs were expected to be completed by February 12 .
France Telecom , part owner of the other cable , said it was uncertain when repairs on it would be repaired .
Stephan Beckert , an analyst with TeleGeography , a research company that consults on global Internet issues , said the cables off Egypt were likely damaged by ships ' anchors .
The loss of the two Mediterranean cables -- FLAG Telecom 's FLAG Europe - Asia cable and SeaMeWe - 4 , a cable owned by a consortium of more than a dozen telecommunications companies -- has snarled Internet and phone traffic from Egypt to India .
Officials said Friday it was unclear what caused the damage to FLAG 's FALCON cable about 50 kilometers off Dubai .
A repair ship was en route , FLAG said .
Eric Schoonover , a senior analyst with TeleGeography , said the FALCON cable is designed on a " ring system , " taking it on a circuit around the Persian Gulf and enabling traffic to be more easily routed around damage .
Schoonover said the two cables damaged Wednesday collectively account for as much as three - quarters of the international communications between Europe and the Middle East , so their loss had a much bigger effect .
Without the use of the FLAG Europe - Asia cable and SeaMeWe - 4 , some carriers were forced to reroute their European traffic around the globe , which could cause delays , Beckert said .
Do n't Miss Internet failure hits two continents
Internet failure hits two continents CNN Arabic
Other carriers could use SeaMeWe - 3 , an older cable that remained the only direct connection from Europe to the Middle East and Asia .
Because this cable is older , it has a smaller capacity than the two damaged cables , Beckert said .
Still , Beckert stressed that although the problem created a " big pain " for many of carriers , it did not compare to the several months of disruption in East Asia in 2006 after an earthquake damaged seven undersea cables near Taiwan .
TeleGeography Research Director Alan Mauldin said new cables planned to link Europe with Egypt should provide enough backup to prevent most similar problems in the future .
Schoonover said a similar Internet problem could not happen in the United States .
" We have all the content here , " he said .
" It 's not going to be felt other than we wo n't get the BBC . "
TeleGeography officials also said most traffic between the U.S. , Canada and Mexico is carried over land , and there is a plentiful supply of undersea cables carrying traffic under the Atlantic and Pacific oceans .
Meanwhile , Internet service was slow Friday in Dubai and Egypt , where online service was intermittent , but there was less demand because many businesses in those countries are n't open on Fridays .
Service providers in Egypt said they hoped to have improved capacity by Sunday .
Web surfers in India were experiencing a marked improvement in service , though graphic - or video - heavy sites were still taking longer to load .
Most of the major Internet service providers in India , like Reliance and VSNL , were starting to use backup lines Friday , allowing service to slowly come back , said Rajesh Chharia , president of the Internet Services Providers Association of India .
The Indian ISPs were still alerting customers to slowdowns over the next few days with service quality delays of 50 percent to 60 percent , he said .
The Internet slowdowns had no effect on trading at the country 's two main stock exchanges , the SENSEX and the NSE , because they are n't dependent on the downed cables , Chharia said .
Individual Web users were still feeling the effects .
Madhu Vohra , who lives in the city of Noida on the outskirts of Delhi , said she uses Internet phone service Skype to call her son in the United States , but she has n't been able to reach him since the slowdown .
" We keep trying for a long time and the message comes up , ' This page can't display , ' so finally we just turn the computer off and give up , " Vohra said .
Internet cafes typically full of teenaged gamers are nearly empty with speeds still frustratingly slow .
" I felt like beating the ... modem , throwing it away , because we compete on the Internet and it feels really bad , " said Aman Khurana , 13 .
State - owned Dubai telecom provider Du and Kuwait's Ministry of Communications estimated Thursday that the problems might take two weeks to fix .

Learning a new programming language , especially one that is a significant advancement over those that you ’re comfortable in , is like hiking a trail that only optionally climbs mountains .
There are few obligatory streams to cross at the beginning : assembling tools to write and compile the code , learning how to write familiar old constructs in the new language .
And then ?
If you ’re learning on the side , that ’s probably the point where you stroll through the lowlands for a while .
In Scala ’s case , expressing the very same ideas as in Java can be rewarding for its concise syntax alone .
And maybe you learned map ( ) already in Ruby ; that ’s an easy one to show off / put to work .
Monads ?
There ’s always tomorrow to climb that funny looking boulder .
Coderspiel is passing the six - month mark of Scala escapism .
And we ’re still not even sure how much of the language we do n’t know .
Probably most of it .
In some ways Scala is almost too clever for its own good — if a language feature is so clean and graceful that no one hears it being used , does it make a sound ?
Just do n’t be cumbersome
Consider implicit type conversions .
Here is how they ’re described in Scala Reference :
Implicit conversions can be applied to expressions whose type does not match their expected type , as well as to unapplied methods .
They “ can be applied ” — who ’s doing what exactly ?
Further research reveals that the programmer defines a conversion function and adds the implicit keyword .
The compiler helpfully applies conversions that are in scope when they resolve mismatched types in the code .
Why in the wide world of programming would you want such a thing ?
Because it is totally awesome .
JDBC , for example , is not awesome .
It was good enough in its day , but other database libraries have evolved such that queries can be written and results can be read with a lot less mother - may - I coding .
implicit conversions can make JDBC awesome .
( Hold on to that link ; it ’s the closest thing to an implict user ’s guide there is . )
val insertPerson = conn prepareStatement " insert into person ( type , name ) values ( ? , ? ) " ; for ( val name <- names ) insertPerson << rnd.nextInt( 10 ) << name <<!;
Nice , right ?
What looks like a different library is really the same old JDBC with PreparedStatement enriched by composition .
Because the enriching conversion is implicit , objects returned from the library can be used in their enriched form without preamble .
And because the original is n’t permanently converted it can still be used normally , giving the appearance that it has been dynamically extended .
This is very handy for extending libraries .
Wrapping one library class the old - fashioned way triggers an unfortunate cascade of wrapping everything that deals with the class ; you end up writing a lot more wrapping code than code that actively improves anything .
But with implicit conversion you can extend libraries ad hoc : one wrapping function works universally , and you need only touch the classes of a library you want to enhance .
With no need to toil away on a sprawling , empty infrastructure , you can wrap a library for the benefit of a single application and still come out ahead .
Let ’s wrap component construction whiners in duct tape
One thing people like to complain about in Wicket is that you have to construct a component hierarchy with … object constructors .
They think they would rather do that work in an additional source file , probably in the cuddly and popular declarative syntax of XML .
Instead of calling for these people to be banned from using all communications equipment , we ’ve decided to try adding some zany tokens to component hierarchy building in the hopes of scaring them back into the woods .
The basic tool in Wicket construction is MarkupContainer ’s add ( child ) method .
Because this and many other component methods return the component itself , it ’s possible to chain calls together and entirely avoid assigning most components to a val .
Why ?
Less clutter or something .
Anyway , once you start you do n’t want to stop .
But there are a few methods that do n’t return the component , such as DataView ’s setItemsPerPage ( ) .
Fortunately Scala has more tricks than Java , like always :
add ( new DataView ( " tings " , provider ) { setItemsPerPage ( 20 ) def populateItem ( item : Item ) { ... } } )
You can take this all the way to the bank ( if your bank has n’t invested in bad debt or whatever all that noise is about ) and never have to assign values to components , except ones that actually work in tandem .
So , we thought , would n’t it be nice to have a RichContainer with a chunky ASCII - art add method that would look cool as an infix operator ?
Okay !
implicit def container2rich ( cont : MarkupContainer ) = new RichContainer ( cont ) class RichContainer ( val cont : MarkupContainer ) { def << ( child : Component ) = cont.add ( child ) }
This is a trivial way to dress up component building ; the substance of it is exactly the same as before .
Note that to use infix notation against this you actually have to say so , as in this << new Label ( ... ) for add ( new Label ( ... ) ) .
Coderspiel labs tested this method against a complicated Typeturner page and found that it was cool looking , but a coherent indentation strategy was hard to nail down and some odd parentheses crashed the party .
this << new Label ( " A " ) << ( new WebMarkupContainer ( " B " ) << new Label ( " C " ) ) << new Label ( " D " )
Only a whiz at add ( ) chaining would be able to make sense of that tree .
Returning the first argument of the infix operation is so counterintuitive that it ’s easy to get lost from one line to the next .
So forget the add ( ) semantics , let ’s make all new operators !
class RichContainer ( val cont : MarkupContainer ) extends RichComponent ( cont ) { def <<[ T <: Component ] ( child : T ) = { cont.add ( child ) ; child } } class RichComponent ( val comp : Component ) { def <+[ T <: Component ] ( sib : T ) = { comp.getParent.add( sib ) ; sib } def <| ( behv : IBehavior ) = comp.add ( behv ) def >>[ T <: Component ] ( child : T ) = { comp.getParent.getParent.add( child ) ; child } }
Here we ’ve added generics to say that the return type should be the parameter ’s Component subclass , instead of just Component .
( Why is that necessary ?
Hm . )
The << operator adds a child as before but this time it returns the child .
<+ adds and returns a sibling .
The convention facilitates understanding operations in a series without having to work very far backwards .
The first parameter is the object preceding the infix operator — but only because that is what the previous operation returned .
And there are exceptions .
The <| operator adds a behavior and returns the component — otherwise , you be at a dead - end .
And >> is for getting out of component dead - ends ; it adds to the grandparent component .
So when those are in play you do have to work backwards , but with behaviors you do n’t have to look far and with >> it ’s easy to find the mirrored << that it ’s effectively closing .
What ?
Okay here ’s an example , inside a populateItem method :
item << new PostLink ( " link " , post ) << new Headline ( " title " ) <+ new Label ( " headlineText " , post. title _ ) >> new Label ( " author_alias " ) <+ new RelativeDateLabel ( " posted " )
See , under item the link contains a headline and a label , and then back under the item are two other labels .
We indent when adding a child and unindent when stepping back up a generation .
With <| you ’d indent as well , for as many lines as there are behaviors .
This is probably not the ideal hierarchy - building DSL ( oops there ’s the buzzword ) for Wicket but it ’s a start .
It ’s sitting in a source file in Typeturner , for now ; the class package hints where it might go eventually .
The Typeturner home page class uses these operators , with moderate enthusiasm , to build itself .
Success !
But wait .
Just like in She - Ra : Princess of Power , this episode had an easter egg , something for the most attentive readers .
Did you see it ?
It was the underscore in the code sample above .
First - class functions are the power of Grayskull
The Wicket IModel interface is a bugaboo that strikes fear in the heart of new users .
Databinder wrote an explanation to try to help them out .
Models can be used for a number of different things ; a model created as an anonymous subclass can produce programmatic output based on the current application state .
Instead of setting a model to some serializable value new Model ( new Date ( ) ) that will not change on subsequent requests , you can make one that will always contain the current time :
new AbstractReadOnlyModel { def getObject = new Date ( ) }
Which is not too bad ( better than it looks in Java ) .
But , we can implement this technique even better in Scala , as the Lift framework shows , by passing in a function instead of a class and a method .
So let ’s create a new model class :
The generic type here is a placeholder , ready for the day that Wicket cuts Java 1.4 loose .
class Readable [ T ] ( f : ( ) => T ) extends AbstractReadOnlyModel ( ) { def getObject = f( ).asInstanceOf [ Object ] }
We can instantiate that for the ever - current date in a label with :
new Label ( " now " , new Readable ( ( ) => Date ( ) ) )
Nice .
But !
Do you think we are done yet ?
No sir we are not !
implicit def func2read_model [ T ] ( f : ( ) => T ) = new Readable (f )
Look at our date label now , everybody :
new Label ( " cur_dt " , ( ) => new Date ( ) )
That is awesome .
And the mysterious underscore used earlier ?
Still pretty friggin’ mysterious .
Lift trots it out a lot , or else we never would have known it existed .
It seems that if you follow a method with a space and an underscore the compiler will know you ’re referring to the function itself instead a value returned from it .
But the underscore trick does n’t work for constructors , so to get the date we went with the regular anonymous function syntax .
Likewise you can use a first - class function to take over for setObject , and apply a tuple of the two functions implicitly for an instant read - write model .
( Promise . )
Along those lines Scala has an abbreviated syntax for functions with one parameter , also involving an underscore , but that mystery will be left for the reader solve .
Now , about those “ monads , ” we were thinking that a component ’s model could or should be one , and … Zzzzzzzz
SAN FRANCISCO 
A federal judge in California on Monday reinstated a series of provisions meant to protect whales from high - powered sonar during military exercises in the Pacific Ocean .
The decision was a rebuke to an effort by the Bush administration to exempt the Navy from those rules and from federal law .
The decision , by Judge Florence - Marie Cooper of Federal District Court , found that the administration ’s Council on Environmental Quality had overreached on Jan. 15 when it cited “ urgent national security reasons ” to approve weaker rules for the exercises .
In early January , Judge Cooper issued an injunction on naval exercises in the Pacific , requiring a series of mitigation efforts including shipboard and aerial monitors to watch for whales and a mandatory shutdown of midfrequency sonar whenever whales were spotted within 2,200 yards of ships .
16 people died from having botulism injected into their faces ?
You do n't say !
A U.S. consumer group has called for a strong warning to be placed on Botox after more than a dozen deaths occurred .
For those unlucky few , the injected toxin spread from the face into the rest of the body and caused " muscle weakness , difficulty swallowing or aspiration pneumonia , a serious condition caused by breathing a foreign material into the lungs . "
Four of the deaths occurred in people under 18 — was it preventative wrinkle therapy ?

Crystal methamphetamine is highly addictive
Sandra Bergen , 23 , suffered a heart attack and spent 11 days in a coma after taking crystal methamphetamine .
Ms Bergen said Clinton Davey had known the drug was highly addictive and dangerous but sold it to make money .
Mr Davey refused to name his source of the drug , prompting the Saskatchewan judge to reject his defence - that Ms Bergen had taken the drug voluntarily .
' Hit drug dealers '
Ms Bergen is seeking $ 50,000 ( £ 25,000 ) in compensation .
A date for a hearing to determine damages has not been set .
" I sued him for negligence ... for selling me drugs and getting me hooked when I was vulnerable , " Ms Bergen told the French news agency AFP .
She said she hoped her case would inspire others to sue drug dealers .
" I think it 's a different way to hit drug dealers financially and that 's where it will really hurt them , " she told CTV news .
Ms Bergen and Mr Davey were friends from childhood .
In her statement of claim , she said he " knew the drug was highly addictive " and that his dealing was not only " for the purpose of making money but was also for the purpose of intentionally inflicting physical and mental suffering " on her .
In his defence , Mr Davey had argued that Ms Bergen " voluntarily consumed illegal drugs , thus contributing to her own condition . "
" She assumed the risks , " he said .
Ms Bergen became addicted to drugs when she was 18 , CTV news said .
She overdosed in 2004 in the province of Saskatchewan shortly before her 20th birthday .
In hospital she was hooked up to a respirator .
She said she suffered lung , heart , kidney and liver failure and may never be able to have children .
She said she has since stopped taking drugs .
Think of drugs , and you think of Colombia , Thailand , Afghanistan .
But Canada ?
Nice , peaceful , dull Canada ?
Believe it or not , there are parts of the country where cannabis provides more jobs than logging , mining , oil and gas combined .

High prices for gasoline and home heating oil are here to stay .
The U.S. is at war in the Middle East at least in part to protect its foreign oil interests .
And as China , India and other nations rapidly increase their demand for fossil fuels , future fighting over energy looms large .
In the meantime , power plants that burn coal , oil and natural gas , as well as vehicles everywhere , continue to pour millions of tons of pollutants and greenhouse gases into the atmosphere annually , threatening the planet .
I got carried away last night commenting on this Read / Write Web post about 6 new Adobe AIR apps .
For anyone unfamiliar , AIR or Adobe Integrated Runtime ( so that ’s Adobe Adobe Integrated Runtime , really ) is Adobe ’s effort at bringing Rich Internet Applications ( RIA ) one step closer .
RIA , for those increasingly unfamiliar with my jargonistic babblings , is the idea of web apps that have a high level of interactivity and preferably can be used offline .
Another example is Google Gears or the recently announced Mozilla Prism ( formerly WebRunner ) .
For AIR apps to work , users first need to download what is known as a runtime binary , which is essentially a library of code that can be used by multiple applications .
It allows for a degree of interoperability and common usage .
A “ sort of , not really ” example of a runtime binary is a Java virtual machine , which allows for an application to be written on one platform but run on many different platforms and still look exactly the same .
There are also .NET runtimes in the Microsoft / Windows world .
I like the idea of having web apps that include an offline component , particularly as more and more services like office productivity , photo and video editing move into the cloud .
However , the fact that users have to download a separate application / library for these applications to work in this manner still feels like a significant roadblock to me .
It ’s hard enough to get people to load plug-ins in their browsers or even extensions .
The popularity of the Flash plug - in does not disprove my point either .
When was the last time you installed a browser that did n’t have a version of Flash installed as a default .
The fact that the runtime has to be downloaded and then installed is another aspect that will work against it .
How many people still spend the majority of their screen time at their work computer in cubicle land where corporate IT has locked the workstation down tight to prevent unauthorised installations ?
Every office job I ’ve ever worked at reflects that situation .
Hell , I ca n’t even use Buzzword at work because the standard operating environment has settled on a version of Flash 9 that is several point releases lower than is required for the word processor to work .
If a point release for a near - universal plug - in is crucial , how much more difficult will it be to increase adoption rates for a runtime binary installation ?
AIR has me interested and intrigued .
I ’d be something of a failed geek if it did n’t .
I just ca n’t see AIR gaining wide spread acceptance while it still needs a separate download and installation for any of the apps to work .
Think I ’m wrong ?
Deluded ?
Uninformed ?
Right on the money ?
Let me know in the comments .
You know you want to .
Two Victorian real estate agents have launched a defamation action against the search engine company Google .
Counsel for agents Mark Forytarz and Paul Castran of Castran Gilbert , appeared in the Supreme Court today for a directions hearing , alleging their clients have been defamed by articles found via Google searches .
The plaintiffs claim the articles suggest Mr Forytarz bullied an intellectually disabled man into selling his home in order to claim a commission of at least $ 200,000 .
It is claimed the article paints Mr Forytarz as unscrupulous and unethical and he suffered distress embarrassment and humiliation as a result .
They also claim another article alleges Mr Castran used dummy bidders to inflate the prices of the properties he sold .
They claim they asked Google to remove links to the articles late last year , but no effective action was taken .
They will return to court in March .
This is an old invention of mine .
I had trouble waking up for work , and traditional alarm clocks did n’t seem to help .
I learned to hit the snooze or off buttons in my sleep .
The problem was that alarms are too easy to turn off , and so I set forth to create an alarm clock that challenges me to prove that I am awake .
How should it challenge me ?
Well , I ’m from a math background , so the natural choice is with arithmatic .
A problem like 23 * 17 + 6 will keep me thinking for at least 20 seconds ; if the alarm clock makes me solve five in a row , then it can be sure I ’m awake .
There ’s no way I can learn to do this in my sleep .
The design is powered by a PIC16 microcontroller , which manages the user interface and keeps time .
It displays the current time and the arithmetic challenge via a cheap lcd from all electronics .
The design is free and open source ; do whatever you want with it .
The source code .
The schematic and board layout ( in ExpressPCB format ) , and an image of the layout .
If you wanted to make advancements to the design , may I suggest :
A battery backup .
As it stands , you must have enough will power to leave it plugged in .
A radio ?
I suggest the Si4701 single - chip radio .
I will be demoing this thing at the next meeting of Make : NYC .

LOS ANGELES
THE biggest question hovering over Sunday ’s Grammy Awards was answered yesterday when it was announced that Amy Winehouse , the troubled British pop star and tabloid fixture , would not be able to attend .
Ms. Winehouse , who was expected to be the dominant figure at the 50th annual awards ceremony , has been denied a visa to enter the United States .
Grammy producers said , however , that they planned for Ms. Winehouse , who had recently entered a rehabilitation clinic , to appear , probably via satellite , during the program , which will be televised live from the Staples Center here at 8 p.m. Eastern time on CBS .
“ You will see Amy Winehouse on the Grammys , ” said Ken Ehrlich , the longtime producer of the show .
“ I ’m very happy . ”
Ms. Winehouse ’s music and image are a bridge between 1960s girl - group pop and modern - day hip - hop , and her addition to the show ’s lineup would fill a stylistic void as Grammy organizers strain to honor 50 years of musical history while staking a claim to post - MySpace relevance .
But there may be some awkward moments if Ms. Winehouse , who has six nominations  for her album “ Back to Black ” ( Universal ) , her self - referential single “ Rehab ” and herself , as best new artist  is a big winner .
Only Kanye
West has more nominations .
Hospitals were last night accused of keeping thousands of seriously ill patients in ambulance ' holding patterns ' outside accident and emergency units to meet a government pledge that all patients are treated within four hours of admission .
Those affected by ' patient stacking ' include people with broken limbs or those suffering fits or breathing problems .
An Observer investigation has also found that some wait for up to five hours in ambulances because A&E units have refused to admit them until they can guarantee to treat them within the time limit .
Apart from the danger posed to patients , the detaining of ambulances means vehicles and trained crew are not available to answer new 999 calls because they are being kept on hospital sites .
Last night the practice was condemned by doctors and ambulance union leaders and was described as a ' scandalous distortion of practice ' by one MP .
Dr Steve Field , chairman of the Royal College of GPs , called it ' absurd , entirely inappropriate and unacceptable ' .
They were backed by Sam Oestreicher of the union Unison .
' A fully equipped ambulance and a fully trained ambulance crew are effectively babysitting patients when they should be out there dealing with emergencies .
Ambulances should not be used as mobile waiting rooms .
They should be freed up to do their job . '
Evidence of patient stacking is revealed in the official ' turnaround time ' data from seven of England 's 11 regional ambulance services who responded when asked for the figures last week .
These show that delays of at least an hour are widespread in the NHS .
Figures relating to the past 15 months show that a total of at least 44,000 delays were reported by the seven ambulance services .
In London , there were 14,700 occasions last year when an ambulance took at least an hour from its arrival at one of the capital 's 35 hospitals to hand over a patient and be ready to respond to the next emergency .
This figure includes 332 that took more than two hours .
The Department of Health says an ambulance should arrive in 15 minutes and , although it includes time taken to clean and restock a vehicle after a patient has been handed over , ambulance staff say that takes only five or 10 minutes .
' These figures show there 's a terrible and colossal waste of ambulance resources going on in many parts of the country , ' added Oestreicher , whose union represents about half the 30,000 ambulance personnel in England .
' The problem is that A&E units are n't admitting patients who are in the back of ambulances if at all possible if it's going to compromise the four - hour target that they are set by the government to treat all patients in A&E .
They are deliberately keeping patients outside waiting in ambulances . '
The London Ambulance Service admitted last month that ' long turnaround times at hospital did have a clinical impact as it meant patients were waiting for an ambulance ' .
It has recently held a series of ' handover summits ' across the city , involving crews and A&E medical personnel , to try to reduce turnaround times by five minutes each and thus boost the service 's availability of vehicles .
Norman Lamb , the Liberal Democrats ' health spokesman , said the accusations represented ' a scandalous distortion of practice to meet a target that is meant to improve the service ' .
Lamb said that he would be writing to Alan Johnson , the Health Secretary , to demand an urgent investigation .
Dr Jonathan Fielden , the chairman of the consultants ' committee at the British Medical Association , said : ' Undoubtedly some patients ' care will have suffered as a result of these delays .
The vast majority of patients coming into hospital by ambulance are in critical need of urgent care in hospital and therefore delay in getting to that critical care can worsen their outcome .
That could include patients with heart attacks , certain types of strokes , breathing difficulties or trauma . '
The BMA claims A& E units are under pressure because of cutbacks in the number of hospital beds .
A Department of Health spokeswoman said last night that ' these statistics are based on only seven out of 11 trusts and measure the time taken to turn around an ambulance for its next emergency , including cleaning and restocking the ambulance ready to go back out on the road .
They do not reflect time spent by patients in the ambulance before being admitted to accident and emergency .
These figures must be seen in the wider context of the 4.3 million patient journeys undertaken by emergency vehicles in 2006 - 07 .
' But it is clearly important that patients are handed over to A&E as soon as possible after the ambulance arrives . '
“ It was a bit of a puzzling picture at the beginning , ” said Scott F. Dowell , the director of the Global Disease Detection Program at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta , which has been in close contact with Congolese officials for several weeks .
But once health workers started dying , Dr. Dowell said , it began to look like Ebola , which is often transmitted through contact with corpses , body fluids and contaminated equipment like needles and surgical tubing .
He now thinks that the early stages of the Ebola outbreak may have been masked by more common germs like shigella , a waterborne bacterium that causes severe dysentery .
That is consistent with findings from the W.H.O. , which reported that some Congo patients were responding well to ciprofloxacin , a popular antibiotic .
“ Over the next few days and weeks , the cases will be sorted out , and you ’ll probably end with a picture that looks like the previous Ebola outbreak , ” Dr. Dowell said .
“ Most of the fatalities will be adults .
The children cases will be attributed to other diseases . ”
Scientists think the Ebola virus lives in an animal host , possibly a bat .
Human outbreaks are thought to start when a person is infected by an animal and then passes the virus to other people .
There is no cure .
Dr. Ilunga said that so far 372 people have fallen ill and 166 have died .
He said the government was concerned that the disease would spread , adding that the first order of business was getting villagers to take sick people to quarantine centers .
Congo ’s infrastructure woes might actually help .
The country is the size of Western Europe but has less than 300 miles of paved roads .
Although that makes it harder to get medical supplies and doctors in , health officials said the isolation of central Congo ’s towns also means that terminally ill people cannot easily travel far , which can limit the infection ’s spread .
Hillary ?
Hillary ?
What ?
It ’s 3 a.m.?
Yes , I know that .
Look , I ’m sorry if I woke you up .
But you said you were fine with 3 a.m. calls .
I ’m calling because we have a serious crisis on our hands .
And I thought of you immediately , because you ’re right , you ’re the only person who might be able to defuse the situation .
We ’ve got a problem with John McCain , Hillary .
Remember him ?
I know , you ’ve been so busy lately trying to destroy Barack Obama that McCain probably slipped your mind .
That ’s why I had to call .

Hillary , listen :
This country could be in serious danger if McCain becomes president .
His national security policies are a recipe for endless conflagration , especially in the Middle East .
Saying McCain ’s a “ hawk ” is an understatement .
McCain makes Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld look like cute little parakeets .
No kidding .
Remember “ Bomb , Bomb , Bomb , Bomb Bomb Iran ? ”
Ha ha .
No , no , you ’re right , it was n’t funny .
And by the way , McCain says your Iraq strategy would constitute “ surrender ... waving the white flag . ”
What ’s that ?
You do n’t want to see McCain become president either ?
Then withdraw from the Democratic race right now , Hillary .

Whoa !
Do n’t get so irritated .
It ’s just that the longer you stay in , the more help you give McCain and the right .
Stop being so mean ?
I ’m not trying to be mean , Hillary .
Please , get yourself another pillow if you want one .
You ’re smart and you ’re tough , and you ’ve blazed an important trail .
But at 3 a.m. -- dark - night - of - the - soul time -- we need to be realistic .
Let ’s do the math together .
Do you want to go find a calculator ?
No ?
Sorry , of course you ’re good at math .
OK -- so before this week ’s primaries , Obama had 1,192 pledged delegates , and you had 1,036 .
On Tuesday , you won in Ohio , Texas and Rhode Island , and MSNBC estimates that after the results have been fully tabulated , you ’ll have eroded Obama ’s original 156 - delegate lead by ... somewhere between seven and 13 pledged delegates .

Whoop - de -do .
What ?
Oh sure , you did manage to regain some momentum .
And yes , I probably would n’t even have called if it had n’t been for those infamous “ red phone ” ads you ’ve been running .
They ’re definitely effective ads , Hillary .
By suggesting that Obama is n’t fit to be commander in chief , you do seem to have shifted the dynamic ; exit polls suggest that Ohio and Texas voters who made up their minds at the last minute mostly opted for you .
So is that your campaign ’s take - away here ?
That if you go all out to destroy Obama -- suggesting he ’s weak on national security -- you ’ll be able to eke out a few more victories in the primaries that lie ahead ?
That ’s what I was afraid you were thinking .
Only a few months ago , you were accusing Obama of attacks on you that came “ right out of the Republican playbook . ”
I should have figured you ’d be studying that playbook yourself .
Advertisement
For the sake of your country , do n’t do this .
You ’ve got 12 contests remaining before the Democratic convention , and given the complex proportional system for awarding delegates , you ’ll have to win all 12 by 20 - point margins just to break even with Obama in the pledged delegate counts .
It ’s not going to happen .
( And do n’t even think about Florida and Michigan .
Trying to change the rules in the middle of the game will tear the Democratic Party in two . )
And as you chase after near - impossibilities , you ’ll be running a campaign aimed at systematically destroying the reputation of your party ’s front - runner -- the candidate who leads in the overall popular vote as well as the delegate count , the candidate who has shown an impressive ability to win the hearts of independents and even Republicans , the candidate who is attracting new voters in droves , the candidate who voters think stands the best chance of preventing Mr. “ Bomb Bomb Iran ” from becoming our next president and leading us into a future of endless war .
This week , right - wing radio host Rush Limbaugh urged Republicans to vote for you instead of McCain in Texas and Ohio -- because “ Obama needs to be bloodied up .
Look , half the country already hates Hillary .
But nobody hates Obama yet .
Hillary is going to be the one to have to bloody him up politically . ”
You were right all along , Hillary :
There is a vast right - wing conspiracy .
The thing is , you ’ve just become their not - so - secret weapon .
Advertisement
Here it is at last , Hillary , a genuine test of your ability to lead in a dangerous world .
It ’s too late for you to win the Democratic nomination -- but if you stay in the race , you can sure help Obama lose the White House .
What are you going to do ?
Hillary ?
Hillary ?
God vs. God
Year Zero is a series of essays mixing my personal account of September 11 and its aftermath with reflections on ethical , legal , political , religious and other implications .
The essays are all collected here .

At 8:48 a.m. on Tuesday morning September 11 , God collided with Himself at the World Trade Center , and blew into shards .
Death certificate number 1 for that disaster was issued to father Mychal Judge , a much - loved Catholic priest who was a fire department chaplain , a recovering alcoholic , a chaste gay man , and ubiquitous in New York City .
The story current within a day or two was that Judge had taken off his helmet to administer last rites to a firefighter hit by a falling body .
This turns out not to be so .
Judge died in the lobby of Tower One , killed by debris that fell when the other tower collapsed .
Nonetheless , he was a hero : he was there and did n't have to be .
On September 10 , Judge had spoken at the rededication of a firehouse in the Bronx :
Good days , bad days .
But never a boring day on this job .
You do what God has called you to do .
You show up , you put one foot in front of the other , and you do your job , which is a mystery and a surprise .
You have no idea , when you get in that rig , what God is calling you to .
But he needs you . . . so keep going .
Keep supporting each other .
Be kind to each other .
Love each other .
Work together .
You love the job .
We all do .
What a blessing that is .
When the towers fell , they also took down the tiny St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox church , which stood in the midst of a parking lot just 250 feet away .
Built as a residence in the 1830's , the building became a church in 1922 .
The Reverend John Romas , St. Nicholas ' pastor , said that he hoped to find relics of three saints , St. Nicholas , St. Katherine and St. Sava , in the debris , along with icons given by Czar Nicholas II .
Mohammed Atta , the man flying the plane which hit tower one and the supposed leader of the effort , had also been thinking about God .
In luggage he left behind in Boston , Atta carried a letter handwritten in Arabic , with practical and religious advice to those planning to die in the mass murder :
Purify your heart and clean it from all earthly matters .
The time of fun and waste has gone .
The time of judgment has arrived .
Keep a very open mind , keep a very open heart of what you are to face .
You will be entering paradise .
You will be entering the happiest life , everlasting life .
The letter recommends a prayer to say upon entering the plane :
Oh God , open all doors for me .
Oh God who answers prayers and answers those who ask you , I am asking you for your help .
...
There is no God , but God .
And the letter says how pleased God will be with the result , " because you are carrying out an action that God loves . "
Atta also left a will with detailed directions on the handling of his body ( it is not clear why he thought there would be a corpse left to bury ) :
.
After that everyone should mention God 's name and that I died as a Muslim which is God 's religion .
Everyone who attends my funeral should ask that I will be forgiven for what I have done in the past ( not this action ) .
To sum up .
On September 11 , nineteen men , most or all devout believers in God , through ruthlessness and " luck " ( if not through the direct intervention of their God ) pulled off a mission of incredible difficulty , against tremendous odds , killing more than three thousand people .
While Mychal Judge was just one highly visible and dramatic example , it is a safe assumption that numerous devout people of all faiths died that morning , unsheltered by their God , who , if not actively backing the Al Quaeda boys that day , was nowhere to be found .
There is a very simple explanation why the people eager to destroy the World Trade Center would see more satisfactory results than the people simply wishing to survive .
Anyone invoking God on the side of the Second Law of Thermodynamics is likely to be more immediately pleased than someone calling on God to suspend the Second Law .
In A Brief History of Time , Stephen Hawking comments that coffee cups frequently fall to the floor and smash but that the shards are never observed to spring back to the table and reconstitute themselves :
The explanation that is usually given as to why we do n't see broken cups gathering themselves together off the floor and jumping back onto the table is that it is forbidden by the second law of thermodynamics .
This says that in any closed system disorder , or entropy , always increases with time ....
An intact cup on the table is a state of high order , but a broken cup on the floor is a disordered state .
One can go readily from the cup on the table in the past to the broken cup on the floor in the future , but not the other way around .
The universe slants towards increased entropy .
That is the reason why it took years to build the World Trade Center and only minutes to destroy it .
Like the coffee cup , the World Trade Center will not leap from the rubble of Ground Zero and miraculously re-create itself .
Mohammed Atta's God manifested Himself through destruction , Father Judge 's through miracles .
Destruction occurs often in our world , miracles never .
When two people invoking God collide , it is consistent with what we know of our universe that the one invoking God in favor of increased entropy will prevail over the other .
We all learned in Philosophy 101 that our perception of a thing is not the same as the thing itself .
The word is not the object ; the map is not the territory .
So , rather than talking about God for the next little while , let 's talk about the idea of God .
Most people who believe in a monotheistic
God believe that God Himself is not vague or murky ; if anything is it is our perception of Him , seen " through a glass darkly " ( 1 Corinthians 13:12 ) .
As Alfred Ayers pointed out in Language , Truth and Logic , all propositions fall into one of three categories : 1 . Statements of logic or language , which are eminently proveable because they rely on rules we created ourselves ( for example , the statement that " ' irregardless ' is not a word , because it contains two negatives and is therefore badly constructed " )
2 . Empirical statements which rely on outside phenomena and can therefore not be conclusively proven because of the unreliability of our observing equipment ( statements about time , neutrons , quarks or black holes , or even , as Hume pointed out , the proposition that the sun will rise tomorrow because it always has in the past ) .
3 . Moral statements ( and he might have added , religious statements ) , which in Ayers ' opinion have no content at all because they can be proved neither by reference to logic or to external phenomena .
" The presence of an ethical symbol in a proposition adds nothing to its factual content . "
Am I right in saying that God is not an empirical phenomenon ?
On September 11 , more than 3000 people died horribly , some by high speed impacts which tore their bodies to pieces , while others were crushed by falling steel and concrete , or fell from 1000 feet in the air , or asphyxiated from smoke , or were burned by flaming jet fuel .
And , as I write these words on December 18 of the same year , I have just heard that New York 's famous and venerable Cathedral of St. John the Divine is burning .
When we try to understand the relationship of God to such events , the choices are very limited :
He caused them or angrily permitted them to occur .
This was the theory favored by the reverends Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson .
In a conversation on the 700 Club cable show , Falwell said : " God continues to lift the curtain and allow the enemies of America to give us probably what we deserve ....
And when we destroy 40 million little innocent babies , we make God mad . "
This is a brutal and primitive idea of God , that he killed Father Judge and knocked down St. Nicholas ( or allowed St. John the Divine to burn today ) in order to scourge us .
cable show , Falwell said : " God continues to lift the curtain and allow the enemies of America to give us probably what we deserve ....
And when we destroy 40 million little innocent babies , we make God mad . "
This is a brutal and primitive idea of God , that he killed Father Judge and knocked down St. Nicholas ( or allowed St. John the Divine to burn today ) in order to scourge us .
God had the ability to intervene but declined to .
This argument is usually used in connection with the proposition that God refuses to intervene in order to guarantee free will to everyone , including Mohammed Atta .
Atta 's freedom was therefore more important than that of the 3000 people he killed .
Some future Mohammed Atta may bear an instrumentality that could end all life on earth .
In that case , will a single individual 's right to choose evil over good be more important than the continued survival of all life ?
If not , can we say there is a threshold at which God will intervene , for example , if half the life on earth is threatened , or 100 million people are , or .... Note that you would have to set that threshold well north of all the people killed as a result of American slavery , or during World War II .
If there is such a threshold , how do you reconcile the idea of a compassionate God with a bureaucratic threshold that dictates that 100,000,001 people will be saved from a terrible death but not 100,000,000 ?
How do you reconcile this view of God with the parable of the shepherd , who leaves the 99 healthy sheep to go rescue the one in trouble ?
God can not intervene in human history .
This is the least popular proposition but you hear it sometimes .
But if God is powerless to intervene - - more helpless than we are -- than in what sense is He God ?
Yes , an all - knowledgeable , all - suffering being may exist , who can watch but is unable to help , but what evidence have we ever seen in our world that such a being exists in another ?
This is why a primary message of religion is that we must not ask questions .
In thousands of sermons after September 11 , including those at funerals , religious men and women of every stripe preached that God is more mysterious than the quarks and that it is best not to doubt His wisdom .
This is the use of God as a semantic stop - sign .
In spite of this injunction against thinking , people tend to provide their own tentative explanations ( often without believing them wholeheartedly ) .
For example , one of father Judge 's friends said at his funeral that the priest could not have tolerated the death of 343 firefighters .
So he had to be the first to die , to greet them all in heaven .
Note that this statement , comforting as it is , does not attempt to explain why God tolerated the death of the other firefighters , or all the other victims .
When challenged for empirical evidence of God , most believers can only resort to personal faith and mystical perceptions of a presence , intense feelings of otherwise inexplicable joy , etc .
All I can say is : Mohamed Atta felt these as much as you .
I promised I would talk about the idea of God , not God Himself .
I departed from this because it was necessary to answer the question whether God is an empirical phenomenon .
If He is , He could , having chosen not to prevent the events of September 11 , easily respond to the confusion about His role in them ;
He could intervene to promote correct ideas about Him and to dispel bad ones .
As He does in an Onion humor piece published shortly after the events :
" Look , I do n't know , maybe I have n't made myself completely clear , so for the record , here it is again , " said the Lord , His divine face betraying visible emotion during a press conference near the site of the fallen Twin Towers .
" Somehow , people keep coming up with the idea that I want them to kill their neighbor .
Well , I do n't .
And to be honest , I 'm really getting sick and tired of it . "
At the end of the press conference , the Onion reports , " God 's shoulders began to shake , and He wept . "
If God cannot give a press conference of this type , or has chosen to hide Himself so thoroughly that there is no evidence that He can , then we are left only with our idea of God , which must be constructed non-empirically regardless of whether or not He exists .
The problem with the idea of God is that it is a wash .
It can be invoked with equal authority on opposing sides of every proposition ; but if God is everywhere , then He is nowhere , because he cancels himself out like the same number added on one side of an equation and subtracted on the other .
The debate on the death penalty provides many good examples .
Religious adversaries of capital punishment are fond of citing John Chapter 8 in which Jesus says of the woman taken in adultery , " He that is without sin among you , let him first cast a stone at her . "
Yet , in Wayne Bedau 's comprehensive The Death Penalty in America , you will find an essay on the Bible and capital punishment by the devout H. Wayne House , who explains that Jesus was not really opposed to the death penalty at all ; he was just lawyering , getting his client off on a technicality .
House concludes :
Romans 13:1 - 7 endorses capital punishment as a valid option for contemporary governments in their exercise of divine wrath against sin .
Remarkably , Romans Chapter 13 is the one in which Jesus says , " Thou shalt not kill . "
But as other religious advocates of capital punishment explain , this really should have been translated " thou shalt not murder " , because various kinds of killing are really fine , including killing killers .
House concludes :
Capital punishment , then , is the ultimate compliment to the human dignity of both victim and murderer ; it implies the most pro-human stance possible .
Part of the problem , of course is that the Bible is a very messy book ; even without House 's logic - chopping , you can usually find vague support for any proposition , in the Old Testament if the New seems to say the opposite .
The Old Testament , after all , is full of directives to commit rape and murder and all kinds of other mayhem .
" Their children also shall be dashed to pieces before their eyes ; their houses shall be spoiled , and their wives ravished . "
( Isaiah 13:16 ) " Slay utterly old and young , both maids and little children , and women ... " ( Ezekiel 9:6 )
When people talk of the " clash of civilizations " and say the Qu'ran is a very violent book , they probably have n't looked at the Old Testament recently .
Even the New Testament , with its messages of peace and love , ends with the psychotic violence of the Book of Revelations .
I really question the judgment of the editor who decided that Revelations belonged in the same volume with the Gospels , or with the chapter from Corinthians cited above : " And though I have the gift of prophecy , and understand all mysteries , and all knowledge ; and though I have all faith , so that I could remove mountains , and have not charity , I am nothing . "
The main problem I have with the idea of God is that it has become inextricably linked with the act of murder .
The Jews in ancient times killed many in service to ( ostensibly at the orders of ) their warrior God .
Most ironically , despite Jesus ' absolutely stark and unambiguous message of nonviolence , millions have been murdered by various Christian elements in His name .
And the Islamic world also knew how to eliminate the unfaithful .
In the recent videotape , bin Laden quoted Sura 9:14 , " God will torment [ nonbelievers ] by your hands , cover them with shame " .
In Medina , an arbitrator appointed by the Prophet ordered the killing of all of the men of the Bani Qurayza Jewish tribe , which had opposed him ; the women and children were sold into slavery .
Dostoyevski created the electric parable of the Grand Inquisitor , who tells a returned Jesus that men are not equal to the challenge of the freedom
He created for them .
The Inquisitor , a cardinal , sees that the only way to make " any sort of tolerable life " for Jesus ' flock of " feeble , unruly , incomplete " creatures is by following the precepts of the devil , " accept lying and deception , and lead men consciously to death and destruction " .
The Inquisitor has intended to kill Jesus , but the latter , who never speaks , suddenly kisses him on the forehead , and the cardinal , moved by a rare pity , sets him free , warning him strictly never to return .
" The kiss glows in his heart , but the old man holds to his idea . "
Just paragraphs later in The Brothers Karamazov , Alyosha expresses the idea which panicked Dostoyevski more than any other : Without God , " everything is lawful " .
But as Mohammed Atta can explain , the opposite is true .
Without God , murder is forbidden by human law ; it is only for those acting on behalf of God , that everything is permitted .
The idea of God is a dangerous one because it encourages gross certainty in a world where humility and doubt are called for , and encourages an inappropriate disregard for human law when it conflicts with the artificial certainties attributed to divine command .
Without God , Mohammed Atta would have ended his sad life a discontented and lonely man , not the murderer of three thousand people .
It took the idea of God to transform Mohammed Atta from a malcontent to a monster .
There are of course many humble and tolerant people who firmly believe in God .
Since I first published an essay in 1995 saying that God does not exist , I have received sad but affectionate mail from such people every week .
A good example is Phil Sevetson , whose letter appears in the November Spectacle :
You do n't , apparently ( obviously ) , have to believe in God to be a mensch -- you 're managing the latter quite well without the former .
On the other hand ... by the degree of heart - pain which you are enduring , by your conviction that you need to be contributing more than you are , and by your apparent resolution to act on your conviction ... it 's pretty clear to me that _God_ believes in _you_ .
Even though I am an agnostic ( no empirical evidence there is a God , and Occams Razor telling us the Second Law of Thermodynamics is the simplest explanation ) I find this kind of thing inexpressibly moving .
When people tell me they have prayed for me , I respond to their kindness , even though I do not believe in the efficacy of prayer .
I receive a minority of mail of the other stripe , like the individual who wrote me recently that the Holocaust ocurred because the Jews offended God .
From a utilitarian standpoint , you could argue that the idea of God has been a net benefit to mankind , inspiring more Mychal Judges than Mohammed Attas .
This would be very hard to measure scientifically , but you can arrive at a possible answer via a sort of thought experiment .
If God is a wash , as I postulated above , then killers and compassionate people alike are motivated by Him ( just as there are also atheists in both categories ) .
Since religion is just one of the numerous elements in nature and nurture that form our character , it is likely that most people would have the same basic character -- the same predilections -- if the building block of religion were removed .
Without God , Mychal Judge would still have been a kind and loving man , and Mohammed Atta an empty sociopath .
But there is a way in which the idea of God might be a net drain on the system .
People do not need much encouragement to be violent in a small way , but it took a concept of God to encourage the murder of thousands .
The mixture of anger , certainty and self - righteousness , all glued together by the precept that God loves mass murder , was a necessary component in the events of September 11 .
By contrast , it is not obvious that the idea of God was inextricably involved as a motivation for Mychal Judge 's deeds .
Compassion may not need glue to the same extent as mass murder .
Whether God does not exist , or is hidden and noninterventionist , we fill His vacuum with human law and moral rulebooks .
Rulebooks promoting values such as tolerance , humility and charity are possible without reference to God .
Such rulebooks , founded both in logic and compassion , are the best anchor we humans have .
The idea of God , rather than encouraging us to cling to that anchor , may lead us to drift from it ; and once we cut loose we may drift anywhere , even to an awful , violent and completely illusory certainty .

U.S. urges Chinese restraintSource : CNNAdded On March 17 , 2008
The agency says it has tripled its investigative staff since then , and counts only 165 serious complaints pending .
But it stopped posting an e-mail address and phone number for such complaints last year , said Jan Lane , chief of security and integrity , because it lacks the staff to cull the thousands of mostly irrelevant messages that resulted .
Immigrants , she advised , should report wrongdoing to any law enforcement agency they trust .
The young woman in Queens , whose name is being withheld because the authorities consider her the victim of a sex crime , did not even tell her husband what had happened .
Two weeks after the meeting in the car , finding no way to make a confidential complaint to the immigration agency and afraid to go to the police , she and two older female relatives took the recording to The Times .
Reasons to Worry
A slim , shy woman who looks like a teenager , she said she had spent recent months baby - sitting for relatives in Queens , crying over the deaths of her two brothers back in Cali , Colombia , and longing for the right stamp in her passport  one that would let her return to the United States if she visited her family .

She came to the United States on a tourist visa in 2004 and overstayed .
When she married an American citizen a year ago , the law allowed her to apply to “ adjust ” her illegal status .
But unless her green card application was approved , she could not visit her parents or her brothers ’ graves and then legally re-enter the United States .
And if her application was denied , she would face deportation .
She had another reason to be fearful , and not only for herself .
About 15 months ago , she said , an acquaintance hired her and two female relatives in New York to carry $ 12,000 in cash to the bank .
The three women , all living in the country illegally , were arrested on the street by customs officers apparently acting on a tip in a money - laundering investigation .
After determining that the women had no useful information , the officers released them .
But the closed investigation file had showed up in the computer when she applied for a green card , Mr. Baichu told her in December ; until he obtained the file and dealt with it , her application would not be approved .
If she defied him , she feared , he could summon immigration enforcement agents to take her relatives to detention .
Plane and train tickets should reveal the environmental impact of individual journeys by stating the carbon emissions released on each trip , the UK 's main professional body for engineers said yesterday .
The Institute of Mechanical Engineers said branding tickets according to their green credentials should be one of a series of measures the government should adopt , so that having a large carbon footprint became " as socially unacceptable as drink - driving " .
In a report on sustainable transport , the body highlighted trains as one of the most environmentally benign ways to travel and put forward strategies to wean people away from travelling by car or plane , including extra fuel taxes , congestion charges and more aggressive road pricing .
For a 400 - mile trip from London to Glasgow , the carbon dioxide emissions per passenger travelling by road are 80.2 kg , compared with 133.7kg by air and 46.8 kg by rail , the report said .
In Britain , almost a quarter of annual carbon emissions are from transport , 85 % of which is from road traffic .
Stating carbon dioxide emissions on tickets would help passengers understand which modes of transport have the least environmental impact .
" If we 're going to understand the impact of our journey , why does n't the ticket tell us ? " said Cliff Perry , vice - chairman of the institute 's railway division .
Virgin Trains said it welcomed initiatives that help raise people 's awareness of the environment and their own carbon footprint .
The report also urges train networks to make conditions more attractive to passengers .
" Overall , sustainability and transport is a big market failure .
If we 're to make a difference , carbon footprint will need to become as socially unacceptable as drink driving and smoking in a public place , " said Perry .
The report , which is due to be discussed with MPs next month , calls for a government - led campaign similar to that used to highlight the dangers and social implications of drink - driving .
One government anti drink - driving campaign led to 72 % of drivers deeming it unacceptable to drink and drive , the report said .
" The real issue here is mindset , changing people 's minds .
If 72 % of drivers understood that their car journey emissions were unacceptable , what choices would they make ? " said Perry .
Michelle di Leo of the air industry group , Flying Matters , said : " In principle , greater transparency over environmental impact is a good thing , but in practical terms , giving quality information on that aspect of travel will be quite difficult , because you need to know which particular type of plane it is , or with railways , where any electricity they are running on is coming from .
As part of our plans to celebrate CD ’s 40 years of publication , our Editorial Collective asked certain writers to reflect on racism in Canada and consider whether or not it has diminished over this forty - year time span .
Their excellent contributions appear in this issue of Dimension .
Around the time of Quebec ’s Quiet Revolution of the mid-sixties , the Liberal Party of Canada took the strategic decision to promote multiculturalism both as a counterweight to Quebec nationalism and as a genuine means for “ visible minorities ” to identify with the dominant political project in the Canadian state .
It is becoming increasingly clear that the commitment to multiculturalism has resulted in an important shift in political hegemony in Canada .
Although real political and economic power remains concentrated in the hands of a relatively homogenous minority , the liberal democratic state has co-opted significant numbers of the elites of subaltern racial and ethnic groups .
Indeed , this has been an important factor in the long reign of today ’s Liberal Party .
So , does the legal centrality of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms , and the central liberal vision of civic equality for all , mean that Canada is no longer a racist society ?
If it does , how do we explain a recent poll of Canadian attitudes toward Aboriginal land claims , which suggested that nearly fifty per cent reject such claims , insisting that Aboriginal people be treated like “ everyone else ” ?
How do we explain the apparent indifference with which many view the arbitrary arrest and detention of people of colour living in Canada in the name of the war against terrorism ?
The first paradox is explained when we recognize that beneath the apparent unity of the contemporary Canadian state there lies a colonial history and a contemporary multi-national reality .
Despite the changes since the 1960s , the Canadian state still involves the unequal coexistence of a dominant and majority English - speaking Canadian nation , a majority French - speaking Québec nation and a host of mostly dispossessed and displaced First Nations , Métis and Inuit communities .
Within the dominant English Canadian nation there is quite simply much greater economic and political power .
This has led to a ( near ) monopoly of information , publication and communication promoting the vision of a unified Canadian polity .
The apparent commitment to equality contained in the Charter of Rights and the idea of multiculturalism serve to erase the fact of the inequitable and unjust legacy of colonialism from the non-Aboriginal imagination .
This places Aboriginal peoples at a structural disadvantage with those who now wish to invoke “ equality ” instead of restitution .
Most of the opinions in defence of equality against First Nations claims are held fervently , in direct disproportion to the knowledge of history and politics on the part of the opinion holders .
The Canadian state is a capitalist state founded upon the lands and resources of indigenous peoples .
From its inception as a settler colony , dispossession of the Aboriginal population has been fundamental to the Canadian project and continues to be so whenever Aboriginal rights and Aboriginal lands present a stumbling block in the drive to open up new territories for profit - driven exploitation .
While the Charter represents an important weapon in the fight against racism , acting as a constraint upon governments and their bureaucracies that violate the rights and freedoms of minorities , for Aboriginal peoples the Charter has an ambiguous legacy .
For example , although some Aboriginal people do invoke the Charter , as in the case of non-reserve , residing status Indians who want to vote in band elections , it is viewed by others as a mechanism to impose a narrowly defined version of equality .
This is because Aboriginal peoples resist being cast as “ minorities , ” preferring the conceptualization of Aboriginal peoples who claim rights that cannot be claimed by other Canadian citizens .
Similarly the constitutional recognition of Aboriginal and treaty rights , a promising initiative grudgingly supported by the Liberals , has to date depended upon activist courts to have any value on the ground for Aboriginal people ’s struggles .
It is generally given short shrift by the state .
This is why it is so difficult for Canadians to square their commitment to liberal and civic equality with their seemingly equal opposition to restitution for original injustices .
The second paradox of an apparent indifference to arbitrary arrests and detentions of people of colour in the name of the war against terrorism is explained when it is recognized that the period since the 1960s has seen a marked tendency towards a racialized working class and an impoverished underclass in some of the key urban metropolitan centres .
Indeed , it might be said that this tendency toward social exclusion and isolation represents the flipside of the co-option of elite members of key subaltern groups to the dominant political project .
In CD ’s view , decolonization and self - determination are the goals of choice for Aboriginal first peoples .
As part of a project of decolonization , which necessarily includes restitution , this goal will necessarily depart from the idea of civic equality .
Within the rest of Canada , the defence of refugees , landed immigrants and citizens unjustly and racially targeted by the U.S. - led “ war against terror ” must become part of our radical sovereignty project .
A war against the war on terror must become our democratic response to the continentalist security - state project emanating from Washington and the closely linked security - state apparatus in Ottawa .

I ’m starting to get emails from angry people who tell me that I ’m ignoring all the terrible race - baiting the Clintons have done .
I think I ’ll just outsource my response to Clive Crook — who is , by the way , an Obama supporter .
Some commentators accused Bill of playing the race card when he called Obama ’s account of his position on the Iraq war a “ fairy tale ” .
How so ?
What did that have to do with race ?
And does Hillary ’s comment about King , the only instance Morris bothers to offer , even qualify ?
She merely said that getting the job done required a can - do president as well as an inspiring and visionary champion .
And so it did .
I cannot see that this subtracts anything from King ’s stature , or that it was intended to .
Whatever its merits , this is the Clintons ’ old theme , not a sinister new one : if elected , she would hit the ground running , whereas the inexperienced Obama would be out of his depth .
It took a hyper - sensitive press to turn that comment into a racial slur . ….
I think the press played the race card , not the Clintons .
It really makes me sad to see so many people get played by the media on this .
If you prefer Obama , fine — but the evil , race - card - playing Clinton campaign is no more real than Al Gore ’s claim that he invented the Internet .
And to Obama supporters , just remember : these people are not your friends .
After they take down Hillary Clinton , if they can , your man will be next .
Add :
If you want to see what playing the race card looks like , watch the Willie Horton ad .
What do we have here ?
MLK / LBJ — but that was totally innocent .
Jesse Jackson — a stupid way to spin a big loss , but hardly part of a coordinated campaign .
Cocaine — stupid and crass , but only race - based if you want to see it that way .
Pretty thin gruel .
Folks , you ’ve been played like a fiddle by people in the media who just plain hate the Clintons .
They tried to take Hillary down over her clothes , her voice , her tears .
When none of that worked , they invented a race war .
There are some perfectly good arguments against Hillary — Iraq , the presence of people like Mark Penn , the big- money Dems in her circle .
But this really is Al - Gore - says - he - invented - the - Internet stuff .
And it ’s deeply depressing to see so many progressives fall for it .
American Psycho : An Elite Exposed in an Exit Speech
SUPPRESSED ANALYSIS : American Psycho : An Elite Exposed in an Exit Speech by Chris Floyd
This is moral psychosis on a monumental scale .
It is the complete and utter repudiation of every civilized ideal .
Yet it passes for normality in our political discourse .
This is moral psychosis on a monumental scale .
It is the complete and utter repudiation of every civilized ideal .
Yet it passes for normality in our political discourse .
I f you would like to see just how sick the American elite really is – how morally depraved , how intellectually diseased , how addicted to the taste of human flesh , the scent of human blood , and the sight of human suffering – then you need go no further than the speech given by Mitt Romney to the Conservative Political Action Conference on February 7 , 2008 .
Now you might say that Mitt Romney is old news .
After all , this was the very speech where he declared he was quitting the presidential race .
He 's toast , he 's over , the fork has been stuck into his well - roasted hide ; who cares what he says ?
This is of course the witless " horse - race " view that dominates political discourse in America : who 's up , who 's down , who 's getting the column inches , who 's on TV ?
But in reality , the American elite – or the Establishment , or the power structure , call it what you will ( as long as you do n't call it what it really is : the ruling class ) – is like an iceberg : most of its vast bulk exists unseen , it plows on beneath the surface , unperturbed by the media storms that rage around the small bit of exposed material at the summit .
Mitt Romney is an immensely wealthy , well - connected man , a former governor of the state of Massachusetts , born and bred in an extensive web of privilege and power .
His defeat in a presidential campaign changes none of that .
He will simply submerge – for a time – back into those depths where the real business of the elite is largely done .
Thus his words to the conservative activists remain a highly relevant indication of the mindset that holds sway over the world 's most powerful nation .
They show the barbarism , hatemongering and bloodlust that are considered perfectly acceptable in the polite company of our rulers and their sycophants .
Indeed , the most remarkable thing about Romney 's speech is that there is nothing remarkable about it ; it is entirely typical of the kind of red meat that many leading lights of American society routinely throw to the slavering rightwing faithful .
It takes a strong effort to wrench your mind free from the media - besotted mentality that regards such a speech as " normal " ( even if you disagree with it ) , and see it for the debased , bestial raving that it really is .
The smoldering core of Romney 's vomitous offering can perhaps be found in his passing remarks on Europe .
Again , in one sense , this was just a crowd - pleasing throwaway : a good Eurobash always gets the CPAC froth flowing .
But in a deeper sense , it cuts right to the corroded heart of the matter , right down to the vicious , primitive , genocidal racism that has shaped and driven so many of the policies of Western elites for centuries .
In the midst of a long diatribe about liberal " attacks " on " American culture , " Romney pauses for a glance across the Atlantic , to evoke a hideous nightmare that could soon be America 's future : Europe -- Europe is facing a demographic disaster .
That 's the inevitable product of weakened faith in the Creator , failed families , disrespect for the sanctity of human life , and eroded morality .
By " demographic disaster , " Romney simply means that there are more non-white people in Europe than there used to be .
To Romney and his fellow elites , this fact in itself constitutes a genuine " disaster . "
Although the population of Europe is still overwhelmingly white ( much more so than the population of the United States ) , even the smallest dilution of racial purity across the continent is to be lamented , decried – and rolled back .
Here of course Romney is channeling fearmongers like Martin Amis , Mark Steyn , and Christopher Hitchens , whose trembly sexual panic in the face of hot - blooded , fast - breeding darkies would be comical , if it were not so sinister – and so useful to the warmakers and global dominationists in the ruling elite .
Romney makes the sexual and racial subtext abundantly clear in his remarks about Europe 's loss of religious faith , eroded morality , etc .
The Euros are plainly too busy having abortions and watching porn to do their duty by the race and breed bigger families kept under strict religious discipline .
And thus the shabby denizens of an alien faith are breeding like rats in the cellarage of Western Civilization , gnawing away at the foundations and conquering it from within .
The fact that " Muslims " are substituted for " Jews " in these formulations and implications of Hitchens , Amis , Romney , et al , does not lessen the precision with which their diatribes mirror those that saturated Germany ( and many other nations ) in the first four decades of the 20th century .
For the elites , there is always a dark , sexually potent " other " out there , whose overwhelming threat to white supremacy can only be overcome by .... giving the elites more and more power .
Oddly enough , there has been a demographic disaster in Europe -- but it has nothing to do with virile Muslim men and their fertile females .
It is never mentioned by Romney and his elitist ilk -- because it is the result of their own philosophy , their own policies , and their own desires .
We speak of course of the demographic collapse in Russia , where the population is dwindling while death rates remain almost twice as high as in the United States and Western Europe .
The Russian people are still reeling from the catastrophic " shock therapy " inflicted on them by Boris Yeltsin 's " Chicago School " market fundamentalists .
( The harrowing story is well - told in Naomi Klein 's study of " disaster capitalism , " The Western elites were very glad to watch the Russian people sink to their knees , die off in droves and suffer in poverty , chaos and fear -- as long as a juicy slice of Russia 's oil , mineral and industrial wealth was in the offing .
The West 's sudden distaste for Kremlin strongman Vladimir Putin has nothing to do with his egregious crackdowns on civil freedoms .
Putin 's depredations are hardly less egregious than those of Yeltin , who actually sent in troops and tanks to destroy the democratically elected parliament 1993 , then ran roughshod over every vestige of law in harnessing the entire power of the state -- and the private sector as well - to ensure a victory in his re-election bid in 1996 .
After that , he laid open the entire economy to the rapacious looting of his corporate cronies and their Western allies .
It is the fact that Putin has taken much of this loot off the table for Westerners -- and given it to his own cronies -- that has provoked the West 's new - found concern for the rights and well - being of the Russian people .
In his swan song , Romney makes it clear that he and his elites want to continue pressing their " shock therapy " on the American people as well , rolling back the very mild attempts in the past to ameliorate , slightly , some of the worst excesses and inequities of unhinged corporate greed .
In fact , Romney identifies these tepid measures as dire threats to " American culture " itself :
The threat to our culture comes from within .
In the 1960s , there were welfare programs that created a culture of poverty in our country .
Now , some people think we won that battle when we reformed welfare .
But the liberals have n't given up .
At every turn , they tried to substitute government largess for individual responsibility .
They fight to strip work requirements from welfare , to put more people on Medicaid , and remove more and more people from having to pay any income tax whatsoever .
Dependency is death to initiative , risk - taking and opportunity .
Dependency is culture killing .
It 's a drug .
We 've got to fight it like the poison it is .
The ignorance -- and inhumanity - of this statement is breathtaking .
Think of it : there was no poverty in the United States until " liberals " came along in the 1960s and " created " it with their welfare programs .
( Before this " culture of poverty " was created , apparently , the few poor people in America just died off discreetly , like Russians , instead of hanging around a bit longer on government handouts , the way they do now , the shiftless , no - good wretches .
Oh yeah , and they breed a lot too , more than white folks . )
And even though Bill Clinton ( uncredited here , of course , but the elite are well aware of his sterling services ) finally drove the stake through the welfare program , these evildoers will still not rest .
Just look at what they want to do : " put more people on Medicaid , " and " remove more and more people from having to pay any income tax whatsoever . "
( Wait a minute ; I thought red- meat - chomping CPACkers were in favor of people paying no taxes .
I guess that only applies to the right sort of people . )
All of this -- especially the stuff about " risk - taking " and " dependency " on government largess -- is pretty rich coming from an avatar of a ruling class that is glutted with pampered heirs of wealth and power who , like Romney , begin their totally risk - free careers at the very top of the ladder , and who are continually fattened with no -bid contracts , kickbacks , tax breaks , subsidies , war profits and myriad other forms of " government largess . "
But beyond the transparent hypocrisy – and the ludicrous pretense that the " liberals " in today 's Democratic Party pose some kind of genuine threat to this cornucopia – Romney 's blast is a perfect encapsulation of the elite 's hatred for the rabble they use as cannon fodder and cash cows .
Let them get sick , let them die , let them languish in poverty , let them lose their homes , let them work three jobs to make ends meet – but by God do n't you ever do anything , anything at all , to change the system that produces these chronic inequities and keeps the pampered elite in clover .
That 's evil .
That 's " poison . "
And it wo n't be allowed .
The speech goes on and on in this way ; reading it is like wading through the sewage pipe of an abattoir .
China and India and other Asian nations pose a challenge that must be confronted and beaten down .
Why ?
Because they may " pass us by as the economic superpower , just as we passed England and France during the last century . "
And we must stop the yellow devils , because " the prosperity and security of our children and grandchildren depend on us . "
Apparently , it is not possible for Asian nations and the United States to be secure and prosperous at the same time ; " our children " can only prosper at the expense of others .
This too is transparently ludicrous , even nonsensical , if taken literally .
Of course , ordinary Asians and Americans could be prosperous at the same time .
What Romney really means is that the American elite cannot exert dominance and gorge itself in the manner to which it has become accustomed if other nations are secure and prosperous in their own right .
And that is where the " War on Terror " – the linchpin of Romney 's speech , and the justification he offers for folding his campaign – comes in .
The Terror War is simply an extension of the long - held goal of the American elite ( and their British " junior partners " ) to maintain and extend their dominion over the world 's natural resources and political arrangements – and the exorbitant profits this dominion produces .
There is ample evidence in the historical record of the Anglo - American elite 's abiding – and quite open – anxieties on this score , going back for generations .
Literally millions of people all over the world have been sacrificed to these ambitions and anxieties , which have not abated but grow more frantic and acute with each passing year .
And thus the climax of Romney 's peroration : a frantic blithering about " evil and radical jihad " and " the inevitable military ambitions of China " and the burning need to " raise military spending to 4 percent of our GDP " and overriding imperative to keep the Terror War raging , particularly on its central front in Iraq .
None of this is remotely connected to the actual wellbeing , security and prosperity of the American people ; quite the opposite .
It is , however , absolutely vital to the preservation of the elite 's power , privilege , self - image and status .
And as they demonstrate day after day , they do n't care how many people must die or suffer for this .
This is moral psychosis on a monumental scale .
It is the complete and utter repudiation of every civilized ideal , of every fragment of enlightenment wrenched from the blood - drenched slagheap of human history .
Yet it passes for normality in our political discourse .

This story was published on February 9 , 2008 .
There have been few experiments as reckless , overhyped and with as little potential upside as the rapid rollout of genetically modified crops .
Last month , the International Service for the Acquisition of Agri-biotech Applications ( ISAAA ) , a pro-biotech nonprofit , released a report highlighting the proliferation of genetically modified crops .
According to ISAAA , biotech crop area grew 12 percent , or 12 .
3 million hectares , to reach 114 .
3 million hectares in 2007 , the second highest area increase in the past five years .
For the biotech backers , this is cause to celebrate .
They claim that biotech helps farmers .
They say it promises to reduce hunger and poverty in developing countries .
" If we are to achieve the Millennium Development Goals ( MDGs ) of cutting hunger and poverty in half by 2015 , " says Clive James , ISAAA founder and the author the just - released report , " biotech crops must play an even bigger role in the next decade . "
In fact , existing genetically modified crops are hurting small farmers and failing to deliver increased food supply -- and posing enormous , largely unknown risks to people and the planet .
For all of the industry hype around biotech products , virtually all planted genetically modified seed is for only four products -- soy , corn , cotton and canola -- with just two engineered traits .
Most of the crops are engineered to be resistant to glyphosate , an herbicide sold by Monsanto under the brand - name Round - up ( these biotech seeds are known as RoundUp - Ready ) .
Others are engineered to include a naturally occurring pesticide , Bt .
Most of the genetically modified crops in developing countries are soy , says Bill Freese , science policy analyst at the Center for Food Safety and co-author of " Who Benefits from GM Crops , " a report issued at the same time as ISAAA 's release .
These crops are exported to rich countries , primarily as animal feed .
They do absolutely nothing to supply food to the hungry .
As used in developing countries , biotech crops are shifting power away from small , poor farmers desperately trying to eke out livelihoods and maintain their land tenure .
Glyphosate - resistance is supposed to enable earlier and less frequent spraying , but , concludes " Who Benefits from GM Crops , " these biotech seeds " allow farmers to spray a particular herbicide more frequently and indiscriminately without fear of damaging the crop . "
This requires expenditures beyond the means of small farmers -- but reduces labor costs , a major benefit for industrial farms .
ISAAA contends that Bt planting in India and China has substantially reduced insecticide spraying , which it advances as the primary benefit of biotech crops .
Bt crops may offer initial reductions in required spraying , says Freese , but Bt is only effective against some pests , meaning farmers may have to use pesticides to prevent other insects from eating their crops .
Focusing on a district in Punjab , " Who Benefits from GM Crops " shows how secondary pest problems have offset whatever gains
Bt crops might offer .
Freese also notes that evidence is starting to come in to support longstanding fears that genetically engineering the Bt trait into crops would give rise to Bt - resistant pests .
The biotech seeds are themselves expensive , and must be purchased anew every year .
Industry leader Monsanto is infamous for suing farmers for the age - old practice of saving seeds , and holds that it is illegal for farmers even to save genetically engineered seeds that have blown onto their fields from neighboring farms .
" That has nothing to do with feeding the hungry , " or helping the poorest of the poor , says Hope Shand , research director for the ETC Group , an ardent biotech opponent .
It is , to say the least , not exactly a farmer - friendly approach .

Although the industry and its allies tout the benefits that biotech may yield someday for the poor , " we have yet to see genetically modified food that is cheaper , more nutritious or tastes better , " says Shand .
" Biotech seeds have not been shown to be scientifically or socially useful , " although they have been useful for the profit - driven interests of Monsanto , she says .
Freese notes that the industry has been promising gains for the poor for a decade and a half -- but has n't delivered .
Products in the pipeline wo n't change that , he says , with the industry focused on introducing new herbicide resistant seeds .
The evidence on yields for the biotech crops is ambiguous , but there is good reason to believe yields have actually dropped .
ISAAA 's Clive James says that Bt crops in India and China have improved yields somewhat .
" Who Benefits from GM Crops " carefully reviews this claim , and offers a convincing rebuttal .
The report emphasizes the multiple factors that affect yield , and notes that Bt and Roundup - Ready seeds alike are not engineered to improve yield per se , just to protect against certain predators or for resistance to herbicide spraying .
Beyond the social disaster of contributing to land concentration and displacement of small farmers , a range of serious ecological and sustainability problems with biotech crops is already emerging -- even though the biotech crop experiment remains quite new .
Strong evidence of pesticide resistance is rapidly accumulating , details " Who Benefits from GM Crops , " meaning that farmers will have to spray more and more chemicals to less and less effect .
Pesticide use is rising rapidly in biotech - heavy countries .
In the heaviest user of biotech seeds -- the United States , which has half of all biotech seed planting -- glyphosate - resistant weeds are proliferating .
Glyphosate use in the United States rose by 15 times from 1994 to 2005 , according to " Who Benefits from GM Crops , " and use of other and more toxic herbicides is rapidly rising .
The U.S. experience likely foreshadows what is to come for other countries more recently adopting biotech crops .
Seed diversity is dropping , as Monsanto and its allies aim to eliminate seed saving , and development of new crop varieties is slowing .
Contamination from neighboring fields using genetically modified seeds can destroy farmers ' ability to maintain biotech - free crops .
Reliance on a narrow range of seed varieties makes the food system very vulnerable , especially because of the visible problems with the biotech seeds now in such widespread use .
For all the uncertainties about the long - term effects of biotech crops and food , one might imagine that there were huge , identifiable short - term benefits .
But one would be wrong .
Instead , a narrowly based industry has managed to impose a risky technology with short - term negatives and potentially dramatic downsides .
But while it is true , as ISAAA happily reports , that biotech planting is rapidly growing , it remains heavily concentrated in just a few countries : the United States , Argentina , Brazil , Canada , India and China .
Europe and most of the developing world continue to resist Monsanto 's seed imperialism .
The industry and its allies decry this stand as a senseless response to fear - mongering .
It actually reflects a rational assessment of demonstrated costs and benefits -- and an appreciation for real but incalculable risks of toying with the very nature of nature .

James Circello sat on the edge of his bed staring at the floral pattern on a generic hotel comforter , contemplating what life would be like in prison .
It was early August , and his parents had given him a one - way bus ticket to Lawton , Okla . , and told him he was welcome home once he got his life together .
U.S. Army Sergeant Circello had been AWOL since April , and with just a few dollars left in his wallet and a dying cell phone battery , he saw two options : turn himself in to military authorities at Ft. Sill , or get the next bus out of town and join hundreds of antiwar veterans convening in St. Louis , Mo .
James was a patriot , and after Sept. 11 , he joined the Army to defend his country .
By 2002 James was in Italy , assigned to the 173rd Airborne Infantry Brigade .
The 173rd deployed to Iraq between March 2003 and 2004 .
Facing redeployment last April , this time to Afghanistan , James asked himself if he could tolerate replicating the disaster he ’d been part of in Iraq .
When he answered no , a friend drove him to the airport .
Circello flew to the United States and has been AWOL ever since .
Contemplating life in his Oklahoma hotel room , James realized he did n’t go AWOL to avoid a second tour of duty .
He wanted to help stop the war , and how better to do that than join with the hundreds of other veterans now opposing the Iraq war ?
So James grabbed his Army - issued green duffle bag and headed for the Greyhound station .
He boarded a bus to take him south to the banks of the Mississippi River , where he joined an international community of veterans working to put an end to war .
James joins a growing number of disillusioned and newly politicized Iraq war veterans .
According to an Associated Press report released last week , the number of AWOL Army soldiers has increased 80 percent since March of 2003 .
The Army says 4,698 soldiers deserted their posts in fiscal year 2007  an increase of over 2,000 soldiers from the year before .
GI rights advocates say the number is far higher .
Soldiers go AWOL for many reasons , and the majority of them do n’t denounce the Iraq war .
However , an increasing number publicly oppose the war , even though this could mean harsh punishments or jail time .
What turns a patriot like James Circello , who volunteered for military service , into someone critical of the United States occupation in Iraq and Afghanistan ?
What experiences turn someone willing to fight and die for his country into someone who , in a recent interview , said quietly : “ It ’s disturbing when you see humanity fail ” ?
Fighting the War on Terror
“ I remember the day kids started throwing rocks , ” James said .
Initially , Iraqis did welcome them , serving them tea and calling them liberators .
But gradually , James says they grew hostile .
“ Not without reason , in my opinion , ” he says .
James can still hear the helicopters beating the air above the city and see U.S. troops on every street corner in Kirkuk .
The city was locked down , the traffic going nowhere , and soldiers were herding families into corrals like sheep .
That was the day smiles dancing on the faces of Iraqi boys hardened .
Boys used to run through the streets of Kirkuk , chasing Jeeps loaded with American soldiers .
They would run barefoot through garbage and did n’t seem to care when the streets became muddy with sewage .
“ They were smiling , ” James said .
“ That was the weird part .
As they ’d chase after our Jeeps , they were smiling . ”
Sgt. Circello lost his belief in American liberation at the same time these boys lost theirs .
Even humanitarian aid was distributed with brutality and chauvinism , James says .
When the chain of command learned there was a shortage of petroleum  and without oil to cook , people were starving  the Army set up distribution centers where women were cordoned into lines made from razor wires .
The wait was endless , and there was never enough cooking oil .
“ It was hectic and maddening , ” James said .
“ U.S. soldiers would put their hands on the women in line , forcing them to move , trying to get them to be quiet and stand still .
They ’d stick guns in their faces trying to threaten or humiliate them .
I did it myself once . ”
In those early days , James did n’t live on an Army base .
His unit lived in a house in Kirkuk .
They did n’t need Humvees , because when something happened in the city , they looked out the window .
Soldiers roamed the streets on motorcycles , and at first , security was n’t such a problem .
But things started going badly pretty quickly .
When soldiers set up roadblocks , if the driver could n’t prove ownership of his vehicle , it was impounded .
Unfortunately , the soldiers relied on a very American way to prove ownership :
They checked for papers .
But the ubiquitous orange and white taxis often existed in families for generations , and no one had papers anymore .
When they were stopped , American teenagers would wrest the sole source of income for several generations of a family from the hands of the family patriarch .
Coming Home
When James went home to Lima , Ohio , his family did n’t ask him about Iraq or about being AWOL .
They did offer to listen , but there was a schism between James and his parents , who still believed in the mission of the Iraq war .
They did n’t want to hear that their son had deserted and was now living illegally in his childhood bedroom .
James is frustrated by how little many Americans appear to have thought about the war , or even know that it continues .
Even today , with the war massively unpopular , James thinks politics is still defining the terms of the debate , and people still seem uncomfortable challenging the Bush administration about the war .
“ People say we have to stay because 4,000 soldiers will have died in vain if we leave , ” James says .
“ But what gives their death meaning if we stay ? ”
Even though he has struggled with how to turn himself in for the better part of the summer , James says he ’s not afraid to go to prison .
His goal is to raise awareness in the United States about the war about the thousands of soldiers who oppose it and somehow to make amends to the Iraqi people .
He ’s terrified he ’ll go to prison before he can do that .
Struggling to communicate this message , James traveled from New York to Ohio , Oklahoma to Missouri , Louisiana to Pennsylvania , and many places in between .
He did this without renting a car or boarding an airplane , because using his credit card would give away his location .
James got a job building houses in New Orleans , where he was paid under the table , but most AWOL soldiers can’t find work because they ’re wanted by the U.S. government .
James does n’t appear to mind sleeping on the couches of people he just met , which is good because with the United States on the brink of a recession , his precarious legal status also makes it difficult to find housing .
As the Iraq war nears its fifth anniversary , more and more soldiers oppose the war , and many more are AWOL .
Soldiers opposing their own government and the wars they ’ve been ordered to fight have never been popular .
Dating back to the Revolutionary War , U.S. soldiers have questioned the morality of war , and when they ’ve acted on these questions , they have been maligned by the civilian population and punished by their government .
Technically , the penalty for deserting during wartime is death .
Today , many , mostly younger veterans , are calling for support of war resisters and trying to eliminate the stigma of cowardice associated with deserters .
Supporting the Troops
“ Right now we ’re in the middle of two foreign occupations , and a lot of people do n’t understand the sacrifice people in the military are making or the reasons we ’ve been asked to make it , ” says Kelly Dougherty , executive director of Iraq Veterans Against the War .
Dougherty says it ’s difficult to return from military service , only to realize many Americans do n’t seem to know there ’s a war going on at all .
That frustration is compounded when veterans have trouble obtaining everything from mental and physical health care to disability compensation , according to Paul Sullivan , executive director at Veterans for Common Sense .
He says the Veterans Administration ( VA ) is struggling to provide for the quarter million Iraq and Afghanistan veterans it already treats , and this is already having disastrous consequences for returning GIs .
Recent Army studies found nearly one in five Iraq veterans have post - traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) , and almost half demonstrate combat - related trauma of some sort .
According to a CBS News investigation , more Iraq and Afghanistan veterans have committed suicide than have been killed in combat .
What ’s more , Sullivan says the average wait for the VA to consider disability claims from injured veterans is about six months , and this helps explain the 15,000 recent veterans who are homeless today .
That veteran services have fallen into such disrepair indicates how poorly planned the Iraq war has been , according to Camilo Mejia , chairperson of Iraq Veterans Against the War , who spent nearly a year in prison rather than return to Iraq .
He says failing services are just the latest example of how the government elects to wrap itself in yellow ribbons and hollow rhetoric rather than meaningfully care for veterans .
“ How do we honor veterans and then send them to fight in an illegal war ? ” Mejia asked this week as the country celebrated Veterans Day .
“ How do we honor the veterans and then not speak out about their service ?
We do n’t want to hear their analysis or their questions , and we do n’t want to hear how their ‘ service ’ in Iraq has changed them .
How can we go on waving the flag and talking about supporting the troops , when we ignore the thousands of veterans opposing this war ? ”
Finding Peace
As the country celebrated Veterans Day last week , James was again contemplating life behind bars .
He spent this week traveling from Baton Rouge , La. , to Washington , D.C. , and then west to Kentucky , where he says he will turn himself in at Ft. Knox .
He says he ’s grateful to the community of veterans  from every state in the country  who have supported him and soldiers like him .
Just like everybody else in the country , it ’s clear James desperately wants his service in the Army to be meaningful .
The difference is that , for him , serving meaningfully means changing the nature of the U.S. debate about the war and somehow making amends to the Iraqi people .
On the phone from somewhere in the middle of the country , James says he ’s ready to resolve his conflict with the U.S. military so he can more effectively accomplish his goals .
You get the sense that maybe he wishes going to prison could resolve the rest of the conflicts he experiences as well .
Postscript : Last week , James turned himself in to the military at Ft. Knox .
Rather than going to prison as he had feared , James was simply discharged with an other than honorable discharge , which prevents him from accessing healthcare or the GI Bill , but at least for now , James seems OK with that .
Now he says he ’s ready to start the rest of his life , much of which is likely to be shaped by his time in Iraq and his experiences as an AWOL soldier opposing the war .
OTTAWA–Trade Minister David Emerson suggested today that the United States has a sweet deal over access to Canada 's oil under the North American Free Trade Agreement .
He said the two Democratic presidential candidates calling for renegotiations may not know just how good the U.S. has it under the deal .
Emerson said today that reopening the three - country trade deal would not be a one way street and that Canada also has its list of concessions it would seek if the continental pact was renegotiated .
" There 's no doubt if NAFTA were to be reopened we would want to have our list of priorities , " Emerson said .
" Knowledgeable observers would have to take note of the fact that we are the largest supplier of energy to the U.S. and NAFTA has been the foundation for integrating the North American energy market .
When people get below the rhetoric and pick away at the details , they are going to find it 's not such a slam dunk proposition . "
The trade minister 's comments came after Democratic presidential rivals Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama said during a debate last night that if they become president , they will pull out of NAFTA unless changes are made to the trade deal .
The continental trade agreement , as well as expanded trade with China and other low - wage countries , have come under fire from labour groups in the U.S. , who blame free trade for the the loss of hundreds of thousands of U.S. manufacturing jobs .
In response to a question on whether she'd be willing to withdraw from NAFTA in six months , Clinton called the trade agreement flawed and said her plan includes telling Canada and Mexico that the U.S. will opt out unless the core labour and environmental standards are renegotiated , and the enforcement mechanism is enhanced .
Obama also said he would make sure the U.S. renegotiates the deal , and " use the hammer of a potential opt - out as leverage " to ensure they get labour and environmental standards that are enforced .
Emerson did not say that Canada would insist on putting access to Canadian oil back on the table , but that provision in the deal has been a major concern to Canadian critics who argue that Canada would not be able to claim preferential treatment in a crisis .
Under the trade agreement , Canada is prohibited from cutting off oil exports to the United States if there is a worldwide shortage or supply disruption unless supplies are also rationed to Canadian consumers by the same amount .
Earlier today , Finance Minister Jim Flaherty said Clinton and Obama may be misinformed about NAFTA .
" NAFTA is of tremendous benefit to Americans , and perhaps the nominees have not had the opportunity to familiarize themselves with the benefit to Americans and the American economy of NAFTA , because there 's a tendency to say `it favours Mexico , or it favours Canada , ' rather than to recognize the mutual benefits that come out of free trade , " he said after a speech in Toronto .
Most studies of the nearly 15 - year - old continental trade deal conclude all three countries have benefited in increased trade , but Canada and especially Mexico gained an advantage in the balance of trade with the U.S .
But Emerson said weighing exports and imports is too simplistic , noting that a car made in Canada and shipped to the U.S. is counted as an export , but includes many parts and inputs from the U.S .
" All three partners have gained and have gained substantially , " he said .
" These people ( Clinton and Obama ) are seasoned political veterans , and while they are under grassroots pressure at the moment and that probably wo n't go away , I think sound wise judgement will prevail at the end of the day . "
He added that the United States ' current economic problems stem not from NAFTA , but from the country 's own self - made subprime mortgage crisis that has battered the housing sector and from growing competition from Asia , particularly China .
Nevertheless , Emerson said he is concerned with the growing stridency of protectionist forces in the U.S. , including many in Congress .
If NAFTA were to be torn up , Emerson said little would change in the short term but that disputes could increasingly spring up with no neutral way of resolving them .
" It 's not so much more fights as a less neutral , well - defined way of resolving them , " he said .

Latin American countries are rushing to defuse the region 's worst diplomatic crisis in years after Ecuador and Venezuela cut ties with Colombia , deployed troops to the borders , and issued warnings of war in the wake of Colombia 's airstrike Saturday on leftist rebels based in neighboring Ecuador .
The Organization of American States ( OAS ) moved to hold an emergency meeting Tuesday to press for a peaceful solution , but in the current heated atmosphere , some experts expect the issue to move quickly to the United Nations Security Council .
Colombia 's President Álvaro Uribe accused Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez on Tuesday of " sponsoring and financing genocide " after Colombian officials said Saturday 's raid turned up evidence that Mr. Chávez paid $ 300 million to support the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia ( FARC ) rebel group .
While most observers consider full - scale war unlikely , they warn that the bluster and saber rattling could ruin efforts to climb down from the current crisis .
" Rhetoric , when it reaches a certain level , is in and of itself a concern , " says Peter DeShazo , the director of the Americas Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington .
" To move things in a positive direction [ the countries must ] stop the verbal confrontations . "
Colombia initially apologized for Saturday 's incursion that killed a senior FARC leader , Raul Reyes , but then claimed Monday that documents found on computers seized in the raid showed that Chávez had funded the guerrillas and that Ecuador 's leftist leader Rafael Correa ( a Chávez ally ) had sent a minister to meet with the rebels .
Colombian police also say they found evidence that the FARC had been trying to get radioactive material for dirty bombs .
Ecuador and Venezuela deny the allegations .
Ecuador marshals regional support
Mr. Correa arrived in Peru on Tuesday to start a five - nation tour of the region to lobby for support against what he calls a premeditated violation of his country 's sovereignty .
" This is not a bilateral problem , it 's a regional problem , " he said .
" Should this set a precedent , Latin America will become another Middle East . "
Ecuador will seek a resolution at the OAS condemning Colombia for violating its territory , says Vicente Torrijos , an international relations expert in Bogotá .
Colombia , he says , will defend itself on the basis of a UN antiterrorism resolution that prohibits states from " providing any form of support , active or passive , to entities or persons involved in terrorist acts . "
Mr. Uribe reportedly spent the day Monday on the phone with regional leaders explaining his country 's position .
Colombia is expected to present further evidence of Venezuela and Ecuador 's alleged support of the FARC at the OAS meeting .
Mr. Torrijos sees the conflict eventually being taken up by the UN Security Council and even envisions sanctions on Venezuela and Ecuador under the antiterrorism resolution .
Carlos Luna , a foreign affairs expert at the Central University of Venezuela in Caracas , says that the nations must work hard not to internationalize the conflict .
" Siding of countries along ideological lines could cause lasting effects on the region , " he says .
Ideology behind the tensions
But politics has driven much of the current meltdown .
Chávez , who on his Sunday radio program said that it would be a cause for war if Colombia attempted a similar raid on Venezuelan territory , has been criticized for meddling .
" The reaction by [ Chávez ] has been irresponsible in the manner in which he took the incident personally even though it is an issue to resolve between Ecuador and Colombia , " says Carlos Romero , a professor of political science at the Central University of Venezuela in Caracas .
Relations between Chávez and Uribe , whom Chávez calls a US pawn , have deteriorated since Chávez attempted to mediate a prisoner swap .
Although six hostages have been released to Venezuelan authorities , Chávez was quickly recalled for breaching protocols .
Colombia has been criticized too , for staging the attack without warning Ecuador , and then for the timing of its accusations against Ecuador and Venezuela .
" The handling of that evidence has been pretty disastrous , " says Gerson Arias , an analyst with the Ideas Para la Paz think tank in Bogotá , adding that Colombia should have held off on presenting the information from the seized computers until the OAS met .
By first apologizing to Ecuador for its incursion into Ecuadorean territory – an apology that Ecuador did not accept – and then revealing the evidence of FARC ties to the media in Bogotá sends " confusing and mixed messages . "
Correa said Monday that the strike by Colombia spoiled negotiations his country was pursuing on a hostage swap – putting another dent in bilateral relations .
" At the present moment it is very difficult to ease the tension between Colombia and Ecuador , " says Adrian Bonilla , a political analyst at the Latin American Faculty of Social Sciences in Quito .
Still , many expect ties between Ecuador and Colombia to improve quickly .
" With Venezuela the breach is much greater , the ideological gap , " says Mr. DeShazo .
" The confrontation is deeper between Venezuela and Colombia than with Ecuador . "
The standoff is stoking nationalist sentiment in Ecuador and Colombia , says Mr. Bonilla .
" Most of the people in Ecuador are rejecting the behavior of [ Uribe ] , in every social condition , and from every different ideological base , " says Mr. Bonilla .
" In the case of Colombia many are supporting their government . "
The region has become polarized so quickly , in part , because of each country 's weak institutions , says Riordan Roett , director of the Latin American Studies Program at Johns Hopkins University 's Paul H. Nitze School for Advanced International Studies in Washington .
" The processes that would normally work out these problems do n't exist , " says Mr. Roett .
" What would normally have happened , rather than forcing ambassadors to leave , would be dialogue of foreign ministers and special envoys . "
In Bogotá , the mood is somber , following the celebratory atmosphere after Saturday 's coup against the FARC .
And while most Colombians believe a war with their neighbors is improbable , some have little faith in a diplomatic solution .
Javier Cardenas says things may have gone past the point of diplomacy and fears an armed conflict could break out .
" Before , it seemed like something far off and impossible .
Now it looks like it 's something that 's possible and very , very close , " he said .

A TEXAS Christian group 's proposal to offer a degree in science education has drawn criticism from leading physicians and scientists , including a Nobel laureate who warned that Texas risks becoming " the laughing - stock of the nation " .
Critics of the proposal by the Dallas - based Institute for Creation Research have peppered the state 's commissioner of higher education with emails in recent weeks .
The institute 's curriculum for the proposed science degree is heavily flavoured with Christian references and creationism , which ascribes the origin of matter and species to God .
Craigslist , the popular online classified system , has been cleared of problems stemming from discriminatory ads placed on its sites .
According to Jennifer Guevin of CNET News , the Chicago Lawyers ' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law ( CLCCRUL ) group had filed against Craigslist for real estate listings that made statements such as " no minorities " or " no children . "
They 're argument was that such ads violated the Fair Housing Act , and that the company was liable for allowing them to be posted .
Chief Judge Frank Easterbrook of the U.S. Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals ruled ( PDF link to the entire ruling ) that Craigslist was nothing more than a courier for the advertisements and could not be any more liable than a parcel courier is for not knowing the contents of a package before delivery .
His Honor went on to state that it was unrealistic to expect Craigslist to monitor every ad placed on its site prior to being listed due to expense and logistics of such an action .
As Ms. Guevin accurately points out , this ruling could be a boon to people who operate online forums .
Most forum moderators worry about their legal exposure if something of questionable content is posted without their knowledge , but it now seems if they at least have a window of time to remove it before they would be held liable for all content immediately upon publication .
Which hand do you favour ?
Opponents simply do not expect a left - hook .
The endurance of left - handedness has puzzled researchers , because it is linked to disadvantages including an increased risk of some diseases .
But University of Montpellier experts , writing in Proceedings B , say it could be because they do well in combat .
THE BAD GUYS Albert Henry DeSalvo - The Boston Strangler Jack the Ripper Billy the Kid Osama Bin Laden
They said that Western interactive sports such as these can be classed as " special cases of fights - with strict rules , including the " prohibition of killing and intentionally wounding the opponent " .
This led them to speculate the same advantage may persist in more aggressive contexts , such as war , so societies which are more violent would have a higher frequency of left - handers .
Skill range
The researchers analysed data for eight traditional societies ; the Kreyol people of Dominica , the Ntimu of Cameroon , the Dioula - speaking people of Burkina Faso , the Baka of Gabon , Inuit people and the Eipo people of Irian Jaya , New Guinea .
BUT THERE ARE GOOD GUYS TOO Winston Churchill Prince William Sir Paul McCartney Albert Einstein Marie Curie John McEnroe Cricketer Brian Lara
The Dioula were found to have a homicide rate equivalent of one hundredth of a death per 1,000 people per year , and a left - handedness rate of just 3 % .
But the Eipo had around three homicides per 1,000 people and a left - handedness rate of 20 % .
Chris McManus , a professor of psychology at University College London who has made a study of the pros and cons of left - handedness , said it was true that left - handers did have an advantage in a fight .
" It 's the same advantage as you see with tennis players , baseball players and cricketers .
But he added : " The question is whether that advantage in fights then goes on and dominates the rate of left - handedness in societies .
" And I think the answer is ' no it does n't ' .
The explanation must be much more complex than that . "
Professor McManus said the more likely explanation for the persistence of left - handedness was the need for individuals with a range of qualities and skills within societies .
He added that the French study had also examined too few people , raising concerns over its conclusions .
Making sense of an input stream
The following simple functions surprisingly often suffice when parsing an input stream .
They either skip , or build and return tokens according to the inclusion or delimiter semantics .
The list of characters to expect , include , or to break at may vary from one invocation of a function to another .
This feature allows the functions to easily parse even context - sensitive languages .
EOF is generally frowned upon , and thrown up upon if encountered .
Still , sometimes the EOF " symbol " can be expected : it may appear in a list of break - characters , coded as a symbol * eof * .
The input stream to parse is specified as a PORT , which is usually the last ( and optional ) argument .
It defaults to the current input port if omitted .
Import
This package relies on a function parser - error , which must be defined by a user of the package .
The function has the following signature :
parser - error PORT MESSAGE SPECIALISING -MSG *
Many procedures of this package call the parser - error to report a parsing error .
The first argument is a port , which typically points to the offending character or its neighborhood .
Most of the Scheme systems let the user query a PORT for the current position .
MESSAGE is the description of the error .
Other arguments supply more details about the problem .
Looking for a string in a sequential input stream
find - string - from - port ?
STR IN - PORT [ MAX - NO - CHARS ] - looks for a string STR within the first MAX - NO - CHARS chars of the input port IN - PORT
- MAX-NO -CHARS may be omitted : in that case , the search span would be limited only by the end of the input stream
- if the string is found , the function returns the number of characters it has read from the port , and the port is set to read the first char after that ( that is , after the STR )
- the function returns #f if STR was not found
Note the function reads the port strictly sequentially , and does not perform any buffering .
The function thus can be used even if the port is open on a pipe or other communication channel .
Platforms
The package is tested on Gambit - C 3.0 , SCM 5d2 , Bigloo 2.2b and MIT Scheme 7.5.2 .
The function find - string - from - port ? is a part of SLIB .
Therefore , it is available on all platforms supported by SLIB .

Input parsing primitives
assert - curr - char CHAR - LIST STRING [ PORT ] reads a character from the PORT and looks it up in the CHAR - LIST of expected characters .
If the read character was found among the expected , it is returned .
Otherwise , the procedure writes a nasty message using STRING as a comment , and quits .
skip -until CHAR - LIST [ PORT ] reads and skips characters from the PORT until one of the break characters is encountered .
This break character is returned .
The break characters are specified as the CHAR - LIST .
This list may include EOF , which is to be coded as a symbol * eof* .
skip -until NUMBER [ PORT ] skips the specified NUMBER of characters from the PORT and returns #f .
skip - while CHAR - LIST [ PORT ] advances the PORT to the first character that is not a member of the CHAR - LIST -- or till the EOF , whichever occurs sooner .
This character or the EOF object is returned .
This character is left on the stream .
peek - next - char [ PORT ] advances to the next character in the PORT and peeks at it .
This function is useful when parsing LR ( 1 ) - type languages ( one - char - read - ahead ) .

Stream tokenizers
The following tokenizers support both delimiting and inclusion semantics for a token .
next - token PREFIX - CHAR - LIST BREAK -CHAR-LIST [ COMMENT-STRING ] [ PORT ] skips any number of the prefix characters ( members of the PREFIX - CHAR - LIST ) , if any , and reads a sequence of characters up to ( but not including ) a break character , one of the BREAK - CHAR - LIST .
The string of characters thus read is returned .
The break character is left on the input stream .
The list of break characters may include EOF , which is to be coded as a symbol * eof * .
Otherwise , EOF is fatal , generating an error message including a specified COMMENT - STRING ( if any ) .
As we cannot tell offhand the final size of the token we are reading , we make a guess , pre-allocate a string , and grow it by quanta if necessary .
The quantum is always the length of the token buffer before it was extended the last time .
This amounts to a Fibonacci - type extension , which has been shown optimal .
An internal procedure input - parse : init - buffer determines the initial buffer allocation policy .
By default , the policy is to reuse a statically - allocated buffer .
For Scheme systems without preemptive threads or shared substrings , this policy proved optimal .
Another implementation of the same procedure is next - token - list - based , which accumulates token characters in a list rather than placing them into an extendible string buffer .
In reality , the list version works just as fast as the string buffer version above , yet the list version allocates 50 % more memory and has to run garbage collection 50 % as many times ( Gambit - C 3.0 ) .
; Example : a snippet from CGI : url - unquote ( let ( ( read - primitive - token ( lambda ( ) ( if ( eof - object ? ( peek - char ) ) " " ( next - token '( ) '( #\= #\+ # \& #\ % * eof * ) " URL - unquoting " ) ) ) ) ) ) ...) ;
Parsing of a comma-delimited list ( let loop ( ) ( cons ( next - token '( #\space ) '( #\ , * eof * ) " " port ) ( if ( eof - object ? ( read - char port ) ) '( ) ( loop ) ) ) ) next - token - of INC - CHARSET [ PORT ] reads characters from the PORT that belong to the list of characters INC - CHARSET .
The reading stops at the first character which is not a member of the set .
This character is left on the stream .
All the read characters are returned in a string .
next - token - of PRED [ PORT ] reads characters from the PORT for which PRED ( a procedure of one argument ) returns non- #f .
The reading stops at the first character for which PRED returns #f .
That character is left on the stream .
All the results of evaluating of PRED up to #f are returned in a string .
PRED is a procedure that takes one argument ( a character or the EOF object ) and returns a character or #f .
The returned character does not have to be the same as the input argument to the PRED .
For example , ( next - token - of ( lambda ( c ) ( cond ( ( eof- object ? c ) # f ) ( ( char- alphabetic ? c ) ( char - downcase c ) ) ( else # f ) ) ) ) will try to read an alphabetic token from the current input port , and return it in lower case .
read - text - line [ PORT ] is a particular application of next - token .
It reads one line of text from the PORT , and returns it as a string .
A line is a ( possibly empty ) sequence of characters terminated by CR , CRLF or LF ( or even the end of file ) .
The terminating character ( or CRLF combination ) is removed from the input stream .
The terminating character (s ) is not a part of the return string either .
If EOF is encountered before any character is read , the return value is EOF .
This function used to be called read - line .
It is renamed to avoid conflicts with many Scheme implementations , which define a similar but not identical function .
read - string N [ PORT ] reads N characters from the PORT , and returns them in a string .
If EOF is encountered before N characters are read , a shorter string will be returned .
If N is not positive , an empty string will be returned .

Sample Code
Count the number of occurrences of a pattern in a file
Count the number of occurrences of a string pattern pat in a file filename .
( define ( count - occurrences pat filename ) ( call - with - input - file filename ( lambda ( port ) ( let loop ( ( count 0 ) ) ( if ( find - string - from - port ? pat port ) ( loop (+ 1 count ) ) count ) ) ) ) ) or , more succinctly , ( define ( count - occurrences - do pat filename ) ( call - with - input - file filename ( lambda ( port ) ( do ( ( count 0 (+ 1 count ) ) ) ( ( not ( find - string - from - port ? pat port ) ) count ) ) ) ) )
If a file / tmp / a.t contains ab abra abracadabra abracadabra abracaDabracadabra abracadabraabracadabra then ( count - occurrences " abracadabra " " / tmp/a.t " ) ( count - occurrences - do " abracadabra " " / tmp /a.t " ) both return 5 .
There is no need to read lines .
In fact , there is no need to hold more than ( string - length pat ) characters in memory , no matter how big the input file is .
Rough - and - ready HTML - to - text converter
dehtmlize port Given an input port that ( possibly ) contains an HTML or XML text , the function copies the text without the " tags " to the current - output - port .
To be more precise , the function omits from copying anything between < and > , and the brackets themselves .
Comments , <!-- ... --> , are disregarded as well .
Note , the comments may contain nested tags .
( define ( dehtmlize port ) ( let loop ( ) ( let ( ( token ( next - token '( ) '( # \< * eof * ) " opening tag " port ) ) ) ( display token ) ( and ( eq ? # \< ( read - char port ) ) ( or ( and ( eq ? #\! ( peek - char port ) ) ; check for possible comment ( eq ? # \- ( peek - next - char port ) ) ( eq ? # \- ( peek - next - char port ) ) ( find - string - from - port ? " --> " port ) ( loop ) ) ( and ( find - string - from - port ? " > " port ) ( loop ) ) ) ) ) ) )
The article referenced below embeds the dehtmlize function in a complete program that fetches a URL and prints out the corresponding HTML document without tags and comments .
The article also compares dehtmlize to the corresponding Perl code .
The Scheme code has a notable advantage over the Perl code in its ability to dehtmlize the input stream " on the fly " .
The Perl code loads the entire text of the input document into memory .
Any Perl code must do that as you cannot apply regular expression substitutions to a port as an input port generally does not allow " backtracking " by an arbitrary amount .
The Scheme code works with a strictly sequential input port ; it needs as much memory as the longest token -- which is far smaller than the whole document .
The Perl code does four passes through the whole input ( one to read it all into memory ; two others do regular expression substitutions specified in dehtmlize ; and yet another pass writes out the result ) .
The Scheme code accomplishes all the work in only one pass .
The size of the Scheme code is comparable with that of the Perl code .

How to read the whole file or a port into a string
The task is to write a function read - all , which takes an input port and returns the string of all characters read from the port till the end - of - file .
The port can be opened on a file , terminal or a communication channel .
The straightforward solution : building a list of characters
The most straightforward ( if not to say naive ) implementation is to accumulate read characters into a list , in reverse order .
The list is reversed and converted to a string at the very end : ( define ( read - all port ) ( let loop ( ( accum '( ) ) ) ( let ( ( c ( read - char port ) ) ) ( if ( eof - object ? c ) ( apply string ( reverse accum ) ) ( loop ( cons c accum ) ) ) ) ) )
This method is clumsy and slow : all the characters read from the port have to be scanned once more during the reversal of the list , and one more time when building a string .
Furthermore , applying a function ( in our case , string ) to a large argument list is inefficient .
Some Scheme systems even limit the number of arguments that can be passed to a function .
Reading the port by chunks
Rather than reading the port character - by - character , we read it by chunks .
We place the chunks into a list .
At the end , we reverse the list and concatenate its elements .
( define ( read - all port ) ( let ( ( quantum 8192 ) ) ( let loop ( ( chunks - rev '( ) ) ) ( let ( ( chunk ( read - string quantum port ) ) ) ( if ( or ( eof - object ? chunk ) ( zero ? ( string - length chunk ) ) ) ( string - concatenate - reverse chunks - rev ) ( loop ( cons chunk chunks - rev ) ) ) ) ) ) ) where read - string is one of the " standard " functions implemented on many systems .
It is also a part of the parsing library above .
The function string - concatenate - reverse is in SRFI - 13 .
For completeness , here is the code of that function : ; See SRFI - 13 for details ( define ( string - concatenate - reverse string - list ) ( let* ( ( final - size ; total the length of strings in string - list ( let loop ( ( size 0 ) ( lst string - list ) ) ( if ( pair ? lst ) ( loop (+ size ( string - length ( car lst ) ) ) ( cdr lst ) ) size ) ) ) ( final - str ( make - string final - size ) ) ( dest - i (- final - size 1 ) ) ) ( let outer ( ( lst string - list ) ) ( if ( pair ? lst ) ( let ( ( str ( car lst ) ) ) ( do ( ( i (- ( string - length str ) 1 ) (- i 1 ) ) ) ( ( negative ? i ) ( outer ( cdr lst ) ) ) ( string - set ! final - str dest - i ( string - ref str i ) ) ( set! dest - i (- dest-i 1 ) ) ) ) final - str ) ) ) )
Using next - token ( define ( read - all port ) ( next - token '( ) '( * eof * ) " reading string " port ) )
This version of read - all runs 4 times faster in elapsed time , 3 times faster in CPU time and allocates 3 times less memory , compared with the chunked read procedure above .
The benchmark was run by a Gambit - C 3.0 interpreter , on a Pentium III Xeon 500 MHz computer with 128 MB of main memory and FreeBSD 4.0 - RELEASE operating system .
Assuming the size of the port or its upper bound is known
If the input port is open on a file and we happen to know the size of the file , or if we know an upper bound for the size of the file , we need to invoke read - string only once : ( define ( read - all port ) ( read - string ( get- upper - bound - size - estimate ) port ) )
This procedure allocates no garbage and is twice as fast as the previous one ( the one that used next - token ) .
Using port-copy
Finally we can use a function port - copy , if it is available : ( define ( read - all port ) ( call - with - output - string ( lambda ( o - port ) ( port - copy port o- port ) ) ) )
This version is about 20 % slower than the read - string - based implementation above .
However this version does not require any estimate for the size of the port .

Exhaustive parsing of nested strings
This problem , posed on comp.lang .scheme in June 2002 , is about extracting all substrings that are delimited by parentheses .
Normally a parser is only asked for the longest or the shortest match .
A string delimited by parentheses may include substrings delimited by parentheses .
The depth of nesting is arbitrary .
For example , given the input string aa ( AA ( BB ) CC ) aaaa ( ( DD ) EE ) aaa ( FF ( GG ) ) aaa( HH ) aaa we should produce the list of strings ( AA ( BB ) CC ) ( BB ) ( DD ) ( ( DD ) EE ) ( FF ( GG ) ) ( GG ) ( HH ) A solution is given below .
It has been tested on Gambit - C 3.0 , Bigloo 2.4 b and SCM 5d6 .
We assume that myenv - bigloo.scm or a similar platform - specific prelude and input - parse.scm have been loaded .
parse - nested - strs port accum
This function performs the parsing task .
It reads the input string from port and adds the list of found parenthesized strings to accum .
The latter is the list of paren - delim strings seen so far .
Initially , accum should be an empty list .
( define ( parse - nested - strs port accum ) ( if ( eof - object ? ( skip - until '( # \( * eof * ) port ) ) accum ; done reading , no more open paren encountered ; we have seen and read the opening paren ( let ( ( accum ( read- accum - within - paren port ' ( " ( " ) accum ) ) ) ( parse - nested - strs port accum ) ) ) ) read - accum - within - paren port fragments accum
The function read - accum - within - paren is a helper .
We invoke it when we saw an opening parenthesis .
The function reads port until the corresponding closing parenthesis and returns the updated accum .
If there are nested paren - delimited strings , they will be added to accum as well .
At the top of the returned accum is the longest paren - delimited string .
The argument fragments is the list of seen text fragments , in the reverse order .
( define ( read - accum - within - paren port fragments accum ) ( let* ( ( token ( next - token '( ) '( # \( # \ ) ) " reading body " port ) ) ( delim ( read - char port ) ) ; what we 've seen after the token ( fragments ( cons token fragments ) ) ; update the list of fragments ) ( case delim ( ( #\ ) ) ; we 've seen the matching closing paren ; ; return what we 've got ( cons ( apply string - append ( reverse ( cons " ) " fragments ) ) ) accum ) ) ( else ; we 've seen an opening paren : recurse ( let ( ( accum ( read- accum - within - paren port ' ( " ( " ) accum ) ) ) ( read - accum - within - paren port ( cons ( car accum ) fragments ) accum ) ) ) ) ) )
As a test , the following code : ( write ( call - with - input - string " aa ( AA ( B ( X ( ) ) ( Y ) B ) CC ) aaaa ( ( DD ) EE ) aaa ( FF ( GG ) ) aaa( HH ) aaa " ( lambda ( port ) ( parse - nested - strs port ' ( ) ) ) ) ) prints the following expected result : ( " ( HH ) " " ( FF ( GG ) ) " " ( GG ) " " ( ( DD ) EE ) " " ( DD ) " " ( AA ( B ( X ( ) ) ( Y ) B) CC ) " " ( B ( X ( ) ) ( Y ) B ) " " ( Y ) " " ( X ( ) ) " " ( ) " )

Reading numbers from a file with comments
This problem , posed on comp.lang .scheme in August 2003 , was to read ( floating point ) numbers from a file and return them as a list .
The file may contain comments , which are marked by the character #\# in the first position , and span through the end of the line .
Files of that structure are often used as configuration files for numeric code .
Given the sample file / tmp / a.txt of the following content # comment # another line of comment 1.23 1.223e12 1.e0 2.3e23 # comment again 2.344 - 1.223e23 2.2334 +1.23e0 # # the expression ( call - with - input- file " /tmp/a.txt " read - numbers ) should yield ( 1.23 1.223e12 1.0 2.3e23 2.344 - 1.223e23 2.2334 1.23 )
The function read - numbers is given below .
It is portable and should work on any R5RS system .
The code makes no assumptions about the distribution of the numbers or comments .
The code scans the input exactly once .
There is no need to read a string and scan it over again .
( define ( read - numbers port ) ; we 're at the beginning of the line .
Check the first char for ; # \# to see if it starts a comment ( define ( state - 1 port accum ) ( let ( ( c ( peek - char port ) ) ) ( if ( eof - object ? c ) ( finish accum ) ( case c ( ( # \# ) ; it was a comment -- skip to the end of the line ( skip - until '( #
ewline * eof * ) port ) ( state - 1 port accum ) ) ; recur ( else ( state - 2 port accum ) ) ) ) ) ) ; it was probably a number ; we 're sure we 're not at the comment .
Read the number .
; keep track if we 're at the end of the line or not ( define ( state - 2 port accum ) ( let ( ( c ( skip - while '( #\space ) port ) ) ) ( if ( or ( eof - object ? c ) ( char= ? c #
ewline ) ) ( begin ( read - char port ) ( state - 1 port accum ) ) ( let ( ( token ( next - token - of ( lambda ( c ) ; recognizer for valid tokens ( cond ( ( eof- object ? c ) # f ) (( string - index " 0123456789eE + -. " c ) c ) ( else # f ) ) ) port ) ) ) ( if ( equal ? token " " ) ( error " bad number " ) ( state - 2 port ( cons ( string - > number token ) accum ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( define ( finish accum ) ( reverse accum ) ) ;
Get the ball rolling ( state - 1 port '( ) ) )

Reading comma-separated values ( CSV )
The problem is to read numbers , strings and tokens from a file of comma-separated - values .
The input port should contain comma-separated tokens , interspersed with the arbitrary amount of white space .
The tokens are : numbers ( that is , anything parseable by number -> string ) , strings and anything else .
The input file may also contain `missing ' tokens , that is , two consecutive commas or the trailing comma , within the arbitrary whitespace .
Such missing tokens are considered `symbols ' whose string representation is the empty string .
The string token in the input stream should be a R5RS string datum : the string should be enclosed in double quotes and may contain ( escaped ) backslashes , escaped quotes , and other escaped characters as permitted by R5RS or the particular Scheme implementation .
read - csv nan - interp port -> list - of - values
Here nan - interp is either a procedure string - or - symbol -> val or an associative list with string or symbolic keys .
The function returns the list of read values : a numeric token is converted to a number ; strings and anything else are passed to the nan - interp function and its result is used in the list of return val s .
If nan - interp is an associative list , we do the lookup in the list then .
For example , ( write ( call - with - input - string " 1.223 , \ " str\ " , \ " complex \\\\ string , indeed\\\ " \ " , 2.23 , nil " ( lambda ( port ) ( read-csv ( lambda ( x ) x ) port ) ) ) ) ;==> ( 1.223 " str " " complex \\ string , indeed\ " " 2.23 nil ) ( display ( call- with- input- string " - 1,+2,-15e-15 , , nan , 22.3334 , 2.23 , , \ " nil\ " , " ( lambda ( port ) ( read - csv `( ( , ( string -> symbol " " ) .
0.0 ) ( nan . - 999 ) ( " nil " . - 1.0 ) ) port ) ) ) ) ;==> ( - 1 2 - 1.5e-14 0.0 -999 22.3334 2.23 0.0 - 1.0 0.0 )
The latter example exhibits `skipped ' tokens : two commas in a row and the trailing comma .
The skipped tokens are represented by 0.0 in the result list , as specified in the associative list in the first argument to read - csv .

Clinton 's experience
Obama communications director Robert Gibbs emails reporters with a picture of Clinton and Sheryl Crow from a 1996 trip to Kosovo Bosnia , linking a series of recent articles including this Chicago Tribune piece making the point that Clinton was n't a central player on foreign policy in her husband 's administration .
Clinton 's claim to the mantle of experience has always been complicated , though it 's one voters , according to polls , accept .
Obama has made sporadic attempts , starting in the fall in Iowa , to challenge it .
This shot — complete with silly photo — seems to open a new front , as well as to signal the general atmosphere of ill will between the campaigns .
DIGG THIS
I saw and heard something remarkable this past week .
I saw Barack Obama deliver a courageous and eloquent speech that he actually wrote himself .
A politician who can write his own speeches and not sound like the idiot he usually is has become a rarity in American politics since the Madison Avenue types took over the political process .
The typical political speech is a product of the staff and has been carefully crafted to appeal to all the points brought up by pollsters and focus groups .
Obama was victimized by the old guilt - by - association ploy .
Somebody dug up some video clips of Obama ’s minister making some strong criticisms of America , as if Obama were responsible for the words of another person .
The implication of such specious criticism is that since Obama did n’t draw a pistol and shoot his pastor dead , he must agree with what the pastor said .
And , naturally , the clips are sound bites taken out of context .
Who among us is responsible for what somebody else says or thinks ?
I hear people all the time with whom I disagree .
I ’m sure many people disagree with my opinions .
No one in the normal world thinks it is necessary to " denounce and reject " someone else ’s opinion just because you disagree with it .
Yet it was clear that political operatives , including the talking heads on television , were going to crucify Obama for something his pastor said .
Obama stepped up to the challenge and met the subject of race and racism head - on .
Most politicians avoid the subject like the bloody pox .
He rejected the pastor ’s comments in question .
He called them stupid .
But , shades of Harry Truman , he did not reject his former minister , who has since retired .
This pastor , an ex-Marine , has been a father figure to Obama for 20 years .
Obama , unlike most of the cynical cowards in politics , was not going to throw a man who had been a friend to the wolves .
When Truman was vice president , a political boss in Kansas City died .
This man , Tom Pendergast , had been a friend of Truman and helped him when he needed it .
Truman ’s aides had fits when he said he was going to the man ’s funeral .
It would be bad public relations .
Truman ’s foes were already slandering him by painting him as a puppet of the Pendergast Machine .
Truman was adamant .
He was not going to turn his back on a friend , and to hell with the political consequences .
He went to the funeral .
The press crucified him , but Truman did n’t care .
As he said later , what kind of man would n’t go to his friend ’s funeral just because he’d be criticized for going ?
Well , Obama put his political ambition on the line .
He laid down a challenge to the American people .
Do you want authenticity ?
Here it is .
Do you want somebody with the courage to make a tough decision that ’s going to cost him politically ?
Well , here I am .
So , instead of caving in to political expedience , he explained why many blacks of his minister ’s generation have that anger born of their experience with racial prejudice .
Then he explained why many whites are also angry because of what they perceive as injustices caused by affirmative action and favoritism .
People should have stood up and cheered .
A president does n’t need the kind of courage it takes to charge a machine gun or to dodge missiles in a fighter plane .
The kind of courage a president needs is the fortitude to make the right decision even when it will be politically unpopular , as Truman demonstrated time and again .
Barack Obama just demonstrated that he has that kind of courage .
My estimation of him went up , because I ’m sick and tired of these weasels who avoid anything that their staff says might cause them to be a shade less popular .
You want a real man with guts in the White House ?
Well , Obama fits the bill .

BAGHDAD , Iraq ( CNN ) --
The pain here is choking -- it 's a dark , suffocating sorrow .
" They took my husband away in front of me .
I found his body in the morgue a few days later .
He had multiple bullet wounds and his eyes had been gouged out , " one woman tells me , forcefully twisting a tissue in her hands as if it somehow could ease her agony and erase the chilling memory .
She did n't want her story told , too afraid that she would meet the same fate as the man she loved .
Her husband 's body bore the " signs of torture . "
How many times has that phrase been used ?
It 's such a common phrase it's as if what really happened gets glossed over : skin scraped off their bodies , fingernails ripped out , horrifying screams of pain before death .
How many times have we reported death tolls from one horrific bombing or another and not been able to get across that these are lives that literally were blown apart ?
No matter how hard we in the media try , Iraq remains a nation filled with untold tragedies , the scope of which so often is overwhelming .
And no matter how hard Iraqis try to shield themselves and those they love from the horrors here , more often than not they fail .
Yet they keep fighting .
See the sacrifices of Iraq 's women »
Nahla works at a radio station and is one of those women .
She 's tall , slender , elegantly dressed and has a firm handshake .
I look at her and it's nearly impossible to imagine what she 's been through .
" This numbers game , you always think that you are exempt from the numbers , " Nahla tells me , referring to the daily death toll .
" You 're pained by them , but you are outside of them . "
Watch Nahla 's struggle to live on »
On April 14 , 2007 , her world shattered .
There was an explosion on a bridge in the capital and 10 people were killed .
Her husband , Mohammed , was one of them .

" And with it , I am motionless , " she says .
" Truly , life was in color and now it is in black and white .
I feel like it is a game of musical chairs we used to play with others .
...
One time you are hit with the chair ; another time , someone else is .
Now , my son and I are out of the game completely , completely . "
The image of the man she loved , tall and proud , is of a doctor who moved his family back to Iraq after the fall of Saddam Hussein because he believed his country needed him .
He was a father who doted on their 6 - year - old autistic son .
Also etched into her memory is the image of his charred body , melted together with nine others , a twisted pile of black , scorched flesh .
Yet Nahla 's voice is calm as she speaks , only breaking at the very end of our conversation , when the pain , buried so deep , rises to the surface .
She could n't suppress her gut - wrenching dry sobs .
I do n't know how many times I have heard stories like hers after nearly five years of war here , and yet I still get chills .
I can't stop being in awe -- nor can I stop looking at these women in amazement .
Life in Iraq has forced people to confront horror that would leave many of us paralyzed .

Where do they find the strength to keep going ?
Some do n't and choose to live out their lives as hollow shells , just waiting for this wretched existence to be over .
But so many others refuse to be beaten down , refuse to allow the horror that is Iraq to win and kill their spirit .
" If I want to see Baghdad again from before the war , I have to do my part while the other person will do his part and the other person will do his part , " says Dr. Eaman , a children 's doctor , as her bright smile seems to shine unnaturally in Baghdad 's grim atmosphere .
" This is the dream , and I wish everybody would believe it and it will happen , I 'm sure , and this is what is keeping me here , " she continues .
" I have been attacked by three insurgents and was going to be kidnapped . "
She now lives at the hospital , choosing to disassociate herself from her 8 - year - old son to keep him safe .
Watch why " I must help my people " »
" I wish I can have him with me , live with me , you know , raising him , and just show him how to do things more than anything else , " Eaman says as she laughs and apologizes for her tears .
She knows she chose to live with that pain because she believes other children need her more .
" Iraq is my life , is my country .
Being a woman and knowing what other [ countries ] look like , I want to make a change .
I want to make a change for the future for a lot of people . "
Yanar is another fighter , petite with curly dark hair and a commanding presence .
" You have been beaten , pushed , kicked and blindfolded , " Yanar says , describing today 's Iraqi woman .
" You can not see , you cannot hear , but you are kicking back .
It 's not OK to be like that .
You kick back and you fight for what you deserve ... you should not be turned into a prisoner . "
She started the Organization for Women 's Freedom in Iraq to act as a watchdog to help safeguard women 's rights amid war and conflict .
She is another woman who exhibits jaw - dropping courage .
Go inside Iraq with CNN's Arwa Damon »
She left her family and her comfortable life in Canada and came to Baghdad to build growing support for women 's rights .
She lives a life that at times sounds more like a James Bond movie -- having to constantly move because of death threats -- than that of a mother of a 9 - year - old .
" At many stages I had to change my house so my address is a secret ; nobody knows where I am other than 10 very close allies , " Yanar says nonchalantly , as if what she is saying is completely normal .
But in Iraq it is -- it 's a country where a person 's parameters of what they accept as being " normal " have to shift to survive .
" What brings me here , " Yanar says , " it is that everybody that I love , all the people that I love have been crushed . "
She adds , " This cannot happen , should not happen , can not be allowed to happen . "
What we as journalists cannot allow to happen is for these voices to go unheard .
No matter how hard it is for us to find them -- literally navigating roadblocks and checkpoints or spending days chasing down someone -- the voices of the innocents caught in war must be heard .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The U.S. military may try within days to shoot down a failed satellite using a missile launched from a Navy ship , officials announced Thursday .
A Delta II rocket lifts off in December , carrying a reconnaissance satellite that failed hours later .
Gen . James Cartwright , vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , told reporters at the Pentagon that the window to accomplish the mission could begin in three to four days , and remain open for seven to eight .
While much space trash and debris have safely crashed to Earth after burning up in the atmosphere on re-entry , authorities said what makes this 5,000 - pound satellite different is the approximately 1,000 pounds of frozen toxic hydrazine propellant it carries .
Without any intervention , officials believe the satellite would come down on its own in early March .
If it came down in one piece , nearly half the spacecraft would survive re-entry and the hydrazine -- heated to a gas -- could spread a toxic cloud roughly the size of two football fields , Cartwright said .
Learn more about the shoot - down mission »
Hydrazine is similar to chlorine or ammonia in that it affects the lungs and breathing tissue , the general said .
The option of striking the satellite with a missile launched from an Aegis cruiser was decided upon by President Bush after consultation with several government and military officials and aerospace experts , said Deputy National Security Adviser James Jeffrey .
" After further review of this option and , in particular , consideration of the question of saving or reducing injury to human life , the president , on the recommendation of his national and homeland teams , directed the Department of Defense to carry out the intercept , " Jeffrey said .
The goal is to hit the satellite just before it enters Earth 's atmosphere and blast it apart so that the hydrazine tank explodes .
The smaller debris would be more likely to burn up in the atmosphere .
NASA Administrator Michael Griffin said there 's nothing the military can do to make the outcome worse .
" If we miss , nothing changes .
If we shoot and barely touch it , the satellite is just barely in orbit " and would still burn up somewhat in the atmosphere , Griffin said .
" If we shoot and get a direct hit , that 's a clean kill and we 're in good shape , " he added .
Experts said that with three - quarters of Earth covered in water , there 's a 25 percent chance the satellite 's remnants will hit land -- and a 1 percent chance they will hit a populated area .
There will be three Navy ships involved in the operation .
The USS Lake Erie , an Aegis cruiser , will fire the missile , while trajectory information comes from a second ship .
The third ship will be used as a backup , U.S. Navy officials said .
The Lake Erie has long been used as the platform for the sea - based missile defense program .
Cartwright said the satellite stopped working within hours of its launch in December and has not responded to attempts to communicate with it .
He brushed off blog theories that the military wants to shoot down the satellite with a missile to destroy any classified data it may have accumulated in its short life , or to prevent other countries from acquiring the technology .
In January 2007 , China used a land - based missile to destroy a 2,200 - pound satellite that was orbiting 528 miles above Earth .
But the impact left more than 150,000 pieces of debris floating above Earth , NASA estimates .
The space agency characterizes nearly 2,600 pieces as " large , " meaning greater than 4 inches across , which pose a potential threat to satellites and spacecraft .
China is responsible for 42 percent of all satellite debris in orbit as of January 1 , most of it from that Fengyun - C meteorological satellite .
NASA has called it the worst satellite breakup in history .

Presidents Can't Manage the Economy
The economy is far too complex for any president to steer .
Feb. 20 , 2008  --
The presidential candidates have been repeatedly asked how they would " manage the economy . "
With the exception of Ron Paul , every candidate has accepted the premise that this is something the president of the United States should do .
Or can do .
Nonsense .
Democrats act like the president is a national economic manager .
Republicans pay lip service to free markets , tax and spending cuts and less regulation — before proposing big programs to achieve " energy independence , " job training and a cooler climate .
John McCain says it 's important for government to do something " to sustain our leadership in manufacturing . "
Why ?
Manufacturing jobs are no better for America than other jobs .
Some argue that they are worse .
How many parents want their children to work in factories rather than offices ?
Increasing service jobs in medical , financial and computer sectors while importing manufactured goods does n't hurt America .
It helps America .
The candidates see the global economy as an arena in which countries compete against one another — an economic Olympiad with winners and losers .
Politicians love to promise they will keep America No. 1 , as if that matters in a worldwide marketplace .
America as a nation does not compete against China or South Korea or Japan .
American companies compete against companies in other countries , but that 's something else .
The purpose of production is consumption , and American consumers prosper when foreigners compete successfully with American companies .
A president who sees the global economy as a competition among nations will be tempted to intervene on behalf of the " United States " and create " good American jobs . "
That 's how governments mess up economies .
McCain says , " It is government 's job to help workers get the education and training they need for the new jobs . "
Mike Huckabee ( who glories in public - works projects as a job - creation machine ) and Barack Obama talk in similar terms .
That hardly shows confidence in the free market , which , if allowed , would train and educate workers just fine .
But it shows misplaced confidence in the federal government , which , as journalist Jim Bovard has shown , has an unbelievably bad track record at doing it .
The endless list of programs , like the Manpower Development and Training Administration , Comprehensive Employment and Training Act , Job Training Partnership Act , STIP , BEST , YIEPP , YACC , SCSEP , HIRE , etc. , wasted billions and " distorted people 's lives and careers by making false promises , leading them to believe that a year or two in this or that program was the key to the future .
…
Federal training programs have tended to place people in low - paying jobs , if trainees got jobs at all . "
Sen . Hillary Clinton told The New York Times recently , " I want to get back to the appropriate balance of power between government and the market . …
You try to find common ground , insofar as possible .
But if you really believe you have to manage the economy , you have to stake a lot of your presidency on it . "
Notice that she equates government power and market power .
That is absurd .
" Power " in a free market means success at creating goods and services that your fellow human beings voluntarily choose to buy .
Government power is force : the ability to fine and imprison people .
Politicians who talk about managing the economy ignore the fact that , strictly speaking , there is no economy .
There are only people producing , buying and selling goods and services .
Keep that in mind , and one realizes that government action more often than not interferes with the productive activities that benefit everyone .
When politicians propose regulations to fix some problem , they should ask if some earlier intervention created the problem and if the new regulations will make things worse .
The answer to both questions is usually yes .
The economy is far too complex for any president — no matter how smart — to manage .
How can politicians and bureaucrats possibly know what hundreds of millions of individuals know , want and aspire to ?
How can government employees fathom what trade - offs to make in a world of scarce resources ?
They can't .
That 's why free people are more prosperous than unfree people .
Presidential candidates should promise to keep their hands off the economy .
Patients did not know they were prayed for
The MANTRA study , run from Duke University Medical Center in North Carolina , involved 750 patients .
Before their operations , they were randomly split into two groups , and half were prayed for by Christians , Jews , Buddhists and Muslims .
However , checks revealed they had fared no better than those not prayed for .
The results of the controversial study contradict earlier findings from the same team which suggested a drop of a quarter or more in " adverse outcomes " - including death , heart failure or heart attack .
However , that trial involved only 150 patients , and the more extensive research , completed this year , found no evidence of any benefits .
The study is the subject of a BBC " Everyman " documentary to be broadcast next week .
Prayer groups asked God to intervene
Neither hospital staff , the patients , or their relatives had any idea which patients ' were receiving prayer , to prevent any chance of the results being skewed .
After the patients had undergone an angioplasty procedure , in which a balloon is insterted into a heart artery and inflated to clear an obstruction , they were followed for six months to see how they progressed .
' Unwise test '
Many theologians say that , even if you believe in the power of intercessory prayer , such a trial is doomed to failure because it " puts God to the test " - and there are clear instructions in the Bible not to do this .
The Bishop of Durham is critical of the experiment
" You ca n't just put in a coin and get out a chocolate bar .
" This is like setting an exam for God to see if God will pass it or not . "
Other experts are highly critical of the concept that the benefits of prayer might be " dose - dependent " - that is , that the benefits might increase as the number of people praying went up .
This is particularly important , as Duke University is at the centre of the US " Bible belt " - and many of the trial participants , regardless of whether they were randomised to receive prayer during the trial , would be getting it from relatives and friends - and of course themselves .
Dr Richard Sloan , from the New York Presbyterian Hospital , described the concept of a prayer " dose " as " absurd " .
He said : " It requires us to abandon our understanding of the physical universe . "
December 8 , 2007
The existence of minors imprisoned in some Iraqi jails was recently confirmed through IRIN , a project of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs .
It was known a priori that brutal executions and a thousand forms of horrifying violence would accompany the �democratic� crusade of George W. Bush in Iraq .
I�m not only referring to the startling images that appeared a couple years ago , showing prisoners tortured and humiliated in Abu Ghraib by members of the US armed forces ; nor am I alluding to the no less atrocious bombings and cutting down of civilian populations by the occupation armies .
I�m speaking of a form of abuse worse than those on the long list of violations committed during America�s intervention : the imprisoment of children .
The UN�s Integrated Regional Information Networks , commonly known as the IRIN news agency , recently confirmed the existence of minors imprisoned in some Iraqi jails .
� They are treated as adults � and subjected to �abuse and torture� during interrogations , reported the news agency .
The investigations began after several families went to a humanitarian organization , Association for Justice for Prisoners ( AJP ) , seeking psychological assistance for their children who had just been released from jail .
This case involved five minors , between the ages of 13 and 17 , who were detained during operations of the Iraqi army in the Baghdad neighborhoods of Adhamiya , Latifiya , Alawi , Dura and Hay al Adel .
They were held under the charges of supporting the insurgency .
� The five children showed signs of torture on their bodies .
Three of them had cigarette burns on their legs and one could not speak because the shock sessions had affected his capacity for conversation , � parents bemoaned .
Torture and Abuse
As specified by international law , children that have been arrested should remain in that situation for the shortest possible time , held in a special place separate from adults , and receive special treatment .
However , these pacts �we know � only serve to file files in the White House � not to be put into practice or complied with .
Despite the fact that the Interior Ministry of the Mesopotamian country and the occupation army deny these accusations �saying that minors who are held for interrogation are released within 48 hours , without suffering abuse or torture �
IRIN affirms that children have remained in prison more than two years , and are mixed in with the adult population .
High - ranking officials of the Iraqi Interior Ministry communicated anonymously to IRIN saying that in each Iraqi jail there are at least 220 children and that they all have been abused .
AJP reported that it has informants in the prisons , but since the organization refuses to release their names , it is impossible to prove the alleged abuses .
IRIN has requested permission to visit the prisons where minors are said to be held , but its request has �of course� been rejected .
AJP spokesperson Jalid Rabiaa said that weekly , at least two children and their parents come to his office in search of help .
� This is not a political game ; they �re young and it�s necessary to respect their rights .�
� They are trying to hide the truth , but the reality is that they are there and they need special help before and after their release , � he added .

The United States has the highest incarceration rate amongst any country in the world , including China , Iran , Russia or any other socialistic country .
Of every 99 people in America , 1 of them is in jail .
That is 1.6 million of your fellow Americans .
This is an increase of 25,000 prisoners within the last year and an increase of 1 million in the last 20 years .
The increase is blamed on mandatory sentencing , non-violent crime incarceration , and three strike policies .
Last year 49 billion dollars nationwide was spent on correction facilities , 4 times the amount spent 20 years ago .
This is 60 % of what federal and state governments spend on higher education , double the ratio for 1987 .
California taxpayers spend nearly 35,000 dollars per inmate for housing .
One of the worst states , Oregon , spends 1.6 billion , which is nearly 10.9 % of the state 's general funds budget .
Also in Oregon , 174 million more dollars are spent on jails than college education .
College education is important because states with a higher college enrollment rate experience a lower violent crime rate .
The top 10 college enrollment states averaged 276 violent crimes per 100,000 people , while the lowest 10 states averaged 440 violent crimes per 100,000 people .
Is America really a violent nation ?
In 2004 , over half of the prisoners in state prisons were held for non-violent crime .
This equals 640,000 non-violent crimes , 250,000 of which were for drug offenses .
In Maryland , almost 70 % of inmates are in jail for drug offences according to the Baltimore Sun. According to White House statistics nearly 40 % of Americans have tried marijuana .
Ninety - seven million people would be a lot of people to lock up .
The problem with illegal drugs is the weakness of human nature .
Everyone has vices , such as food , gambling , video games , tobacco , alcohol , and sex .
How do you decide which vices are good and which are bad ?
Yearly deaths from alcohol and tobacco are 150,000 and 430,000 respectively .
Illegal drugs , on the other hand , are estimated to have killed 28,000 people .
Alcohol and tobacco are drugs with health issues and society issues , like cancer , overdose deaths , and drunk driving .
Instead of being illegal , cigarettes and alcohol are heavily taxed and the tax revenue is spent on state and federal programs .
Tobacco and alcohol are produced in the US and create jobs .
Their cost is relatively low because they are readily available compared to the black market of illegal drugs .
Higher prices means more money is involved and more people are willing to put their life on the line .
Prohibition in the 1920s did n't work .
It formed organized crime that was responsible for many violent crimes .
The murder rate went from 1 person per every 100,000 in 1907 to 8 people per 100,000 in 1919 when the 18th amendment was passed .
By 1933 when the amendment was reversed , this number was 10 in every 100,000 .
Fast forward to the 1991 and 6 % of all homicides were related to drug manufacturing and trafficking .
Even more outstanding is that 10 % of federal inmates and 17 % of state inmates in were in jail for crimes committed in order to obtain money for drugs .
Today , gangs from Mexico and other countries illegally enter the United States to traffic drugs .
These gangs are responsible for murders of rival street gangs with police and innocent civilians caught in the battle .
Drug trafficking money also goes to support terrorist organizations or militias in foreign countries .
There are few cases today where tobacco and alcohol have caused people to murder or smuggle them into the country .
By outlawing drugs , America is increasing its violent crime rate , supporting gangs , spending billions of tax payer dollars , increasing illegal border crossings , removing citizens from society , and supporting terrorism .
The problem with mandatory sentencing and locking people up for non-violent crimes like drug offenses is that prison affects the rest of a person 's life .
Health care is poor in prisons with rampant diseases and viruses that spread through the inmates close quarters .
Putting a non-violent offender in a jail with violent offenders may alter a person 's psychology .
Some studies , like those conducted by Jesse Shapiro and Keith Chen , have found that criminals are more violent when they are released from prison .
This makes sense when a prisoner is exposed to a life of abuse , violence and harassment inside prison walls .
Rehabilitating a prisoner back into society is tough .
If a person has a record his or her job options become limited .
A lot of businesses will not hire an ex-con , and other positions are simply not available to ex-cons .
When incarcerated , personal relationships can fall apart and key people ( spouse , friend , etc ) that would help rehabilitate the person are lost .
Families can also be torn apart when a parental figure is sent to jail .
The good news is that violent crimes in the US have been on the decline .
In the last 20 years violent crime has declined about 4.4 % , while the total crime rate has declined about 15.6 % .
For violent crimes , this is a decrease of about 65,000 cases ( from 1.483 million to 1.417 million ) .
Could stiffer sentencing be the reason for the decline ?
Sending a person to jail only happens after a crime is committed ; therefore , stiffer sentences only prevent repeat offenses .
Other factors that affect the crime rate include unemployment rate , income levels , single parents , living conditions , growth of the military , population age and income inequality .
The US military often employs young Americans from low income families that are high school dropouts or have just gotten a high school degree .
This class of people also has the highest imprisonment rate .
Still if all other factors are ignored , the United States has increased prison population by over 2 times to decrease crime by 30 % at a cost of 49 billion to the American taxpayer .
The Exploratorium is the interactive science museum that sets the platinum standard .
To call it a museum is really unfair .
It is actually a playground for the techie in us all .
With hundreds of interactive exhibits on space , chemistry , weather , language , it is the ultimate spot for a techie date .
If you can't visit in person , you can always meet your date 's avatar in the Second Life version .

LONDON , March 24 , 2008  --
For 24 years Pascal Coler 's face drew so many taunts in the street that he retreated to his home to live the painful life of a recluse .
All of that changed one night in January when he got the call :
They 'd found a face donor .
After 16 hours in the operating room , Coler emerged with a new face .
Laurent Lantieri , the head of plastic surgery at Henri-Mondor Hospital , says that " almost all " of Coler 's face was replaced with that of a donor : new lips , cheeks , nose and mouth .
Lantieri , who took part in the operation , hails it as the world 's first full face transplant .
Coler suffers from neurofibromatosis , an extremely rare condition that causes tumors to grow on a victim 's face , disfiguring it beyond recognition .
Remember the movie " The Elephant Man " ?
The eponymous man , known in real life as Jospeh Merrick , was long believed to have suffered from the same disorder , although in recent years the prevailing theory is that Merrick suffered from a similar , but much rarer , condition known as Proteus syndrome .
Coler 's condition began to take its toll when he was a little boy .
As it progressed , he says , people would faint when they saw him .
After 24 years of suffering , Coler was given a new face .
" At first we were quite frightened to do the transplant , " said Lantieri .
" We did n't know how the patient would tolerate the fact to have a new face . "
Doctors cut his skin away and replaced it with the face of an unnamed donor , painstakingly connecting arteries , veins and nerves .
When his mother and sister saw his new face , Coler said , " both burst into tears of absolute happiness .
It was one of the happiest days of their lives . "
But Coler does not look like the anonymous donor .
" It is not like the movie ' Face Off , ' " said Lantieri .
In that movie , Nicholas Cage and John Travolta change faces and take on the other 's identity .
" Fiction , " said the professor .
Coler 's bone structure has not been altered , so he looks as he might have looked if his face had never been ravaged by disease .
And he 's happy .
" The operation revolutionized my life , " Coler said .
" People no longer stop and stare at me in the street .
They do n't make fun of me anymore . "
These operations are extremely rare .
In 2005 Isabelle Dinoire received the world 's first partial - face transplant -- she was given new lips , a nose and mouth after she was mauled by her dog .
Now she 's doing well .
In 2006 a Chinese man received a partial - face transplant after he was attacked by a bear .
France is at the forefront of the field , but surgery like this has never been carried out in the United States .
The Brigham and Women 's Hospital in Boston has just been given permission to try and right now it is looking for suitable patients and donors .
That could take months or even years .
Coler 's operation took place early last year .
The immunosuppressive drugs worked .
His body did not reject his new face .
If it had , Coler would probably be dead .
Instead , the 30 - year - old hopes for a normal life .
He 's started work as an accountant , plans to take up basketball and tennis again and hopes to find love for the first time .
" I 'd love to find a wife , " Coler said .
" Settle down and have children . "

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The U.S. State Department is offering free flights out of Yemen to non-essential diplomats and family members , after three mortars hit a school near the U.S. Embassy in Sanaa .
“ The Department of State authorized the voluntary departure for embassy employees and eligible family members after several explosions targeted the embassy compound on March 18 , ” the State Department said on Wednesday in an advisory warning Americans against travel to Yemen .
“ The security threat level remains high due to terrorist activities in Yemen , ” the State Department said .
Thirteen girls and five Yemeni soldiers were wounded in Tuesday ’s attack near the U.S. mission in the Yemeni capital .
Yemen said “ terrorists ” were behind the attack .
The ancestral home of Osama bin Laden , Yemen is viewed in the West as a haven for Islamic militants , dozens of whom are jailed in the Arabian Peninsula country for involvement in bombings of Western targets and clashes with authorities .
Yemen , which joined a U.S. - led campaign against militants after the September 11 , 2001 , attacks on U.S. cities , has also witnessed a number of militant attacks targeting foreign tourists , oil installations and U.S. and French ships .
Map of Iapetus - January 2008
This global map of Iapetus was created using images taken during Cassini spacecraft flybys , with Voyager images filling in the poles .
The map is an equidistant projection and has a scale of 803 meters ( 0.5 miles ) per pixel .
Some territory seen in this map was imaged by Cassini 's cameras using reflected light from Saturn .
The mean radius of Iapetus used for projection of this map is 736 kilometers ( 457 miles ) .
The resolution of the map is 16 pixels per degree .
This updated map has been shifted west by 4.5 degrees of longitude , compared to the previously released Cassini product ( see PIA07778 ) , in order to conform to the International Astronomical Union longitude system convention for Iapetus .
The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA , the European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency .
The Jet Propulsion Laboratory , a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena , manages the mission for NASA 's Science Mission Directorate , Washington , D.C. The Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed , developed and assembled at JPL .
The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in Boulder , Colo .

Liberals , for their part , have long objected that many expenditures included in G.D.P. reflect reductions , not increases , in our standard of living .
When crime rates increase , people spend more on burglar alarms , purchases that clearly do not signal improved living standards .
A similar objection applies when tasks once performed at home are now more often bought in the marketplace  as when time - pressed parents substitute meals at fast - food restaurants for home - cooked meals .
Image Credit ... David G. Klein
The bias that results from the inclusion of such expenditures in G.D.P. works in the opposite direction from the bias caused by inaccurate inflation adjustment .
For all anyone knows , the two distortions may roughly offset each other .
But there is a much bigger problem , one that challenges the very foundation of the presumed link between per-capita G.D.P. and economic welfare .
That ’s the assumption , traditional in economic models , that absolute income levels are the primary determinant of individual well - being .
This assumption is contradicted by consistent survey findings that when everyone ’s income grows at about the same rate , average levels of happiness remain the same .
Yet at any given moment , the pattern is that wealthy people are happier , on average , than poor people .
Together , these findings suggest that relative income is a much better predictor of well - being than absolute income .
In the three decades after World War II , the relationship between well - being and income distribution was not a big issue , because incomes were growing at about the same rate for all income groups .
Since the mid-1970s , however , income growth has been confined almost entirely to top earners .
Changes in per-capita G.D.P. , which track only changes in average income , are completely silent about the effects of this shift .
When measuring the economic welfare of the typical family , the natural focus is on median , or 50th percentile , family earnings .
Per-capita G.D.P. has grown by more than 85 percent since 1973 , while median family earnings have grown by less than one - fifth that amount .
Changing patterns of income growth have thus caused per-capita G.D.P. growth to vastly overstate the increase in the typical family ’s standard of living during the past three decades .
Some economists have advanced an even stronger claim  that there is no link , at least in developed countries , between absolute spending and well - being .
Recent work suggests that this is especially true for spending categories in which the link between well - being and relative consumption is strongest .
For instance , when the rich spend more on larger mansions or more elaborate coming - of - age parties for their children , the apparent effect is merely to redefine what counts as adequate .
Five years ago this month , the three of us left the US Foreign Service in opposition to the war on Iraq .
We were not pacifists .
We were professional , non-partisan diplomats bound by our oath of loyalty to the US Constitution .
Our job was to build effective relationships with key figures outside the United States .
We used our language skills , respectful curiosity , and understanding of local politics to promote US national interests as our president and secretary of state directed .
We did not know each other .
Ann , who was also a reserve colonel in the US Army , had helped reopen US Embassy Kabul after the fall of the Taliban .
Brady was a 20 - year political officer who had learned something about tribal politics and the limits of US power .
John was a practitioner of public diplomacy with over twenty years ' experience , mostly in Eastern Europe .
We shared one key professional judgment , that this war we were ordered to promote would be a disastrous mistake .
Love of country and professional self - respect compelled each of us to speak out , in the only honorable way open to us , by resigning .
In our letters to Secretary of State Colin Powell , we opposed invading a country that posed no genuine threat to the United States .
We underscored that our invasion would not be understood by our allies , that our occupation would be resisted , and that the consequences of the war would be dire for both Americans and Iraqis .
The war happened , with tragic but predictable consequences .
Mistakes by ambitious , ignorant political appointees worsened the fiasco .
For domestic political reasons , the Bush Administration could not adapt its policies to the reality that its " war on terrorism " was actually an intricate maze of local conflicts into which it had blundered without a guide .
The invasion of Iraq had a terrible impact on America 's relationship with the world .
The tricks of totalitarian manipulation of public opinion the White House used to " sell " the war at home -- simplification of the issues , repetition of empty phrases , demonization of foreigners , and falsification of history -- simply did not work abroad .

By counting on such methods , Bush appointees tainted the US informational , educational , and cultural programs that once were the beating heart of America 's public diplomacy efforts .
The desperate PR campaign by Mr. Bush 's Texas confidante , former Under Secretary of State for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs Karen Hughes , failed utterly to repair the damage .
Five years later , we are convinced that the Bush administration is still on the wrong path for regional stability .
Key officials lack the empathy and local knowledge needed to wield the tools of US diplomacy effectively in the Middle East .
America 's outsized military presence is the principle around which local fanaticism organizes itself , to the detriment of the ordinary Arabs and Kurds America aspired to help .
A rapid withdrawal from Iraq , coordinated with Iraqi factions and neighboring states , is the least destructive option remaining .
Our gesture earned us a brief moment in the media and the cautious respect of our colleagues .
Five years later , we do not regret our decision to leave the profession we loved .
Faced with a flawed policy we had no power to change , the three of us embraced the hope Brady expressed in his resignation letter , that " our democratic process is ultimately self - correcting ; [ we ] hope in a small way to contribute from outside to shaping policies that better serve the security and prosperity of the American people and the world we share . "
Between now and next January 20 the stakes for our former profession are high .
The stakes for the American people and the planet are even higher .

TMZ has learned the man who committed suicide on Mel Gibson 's property was a construction foreman on a number of movie sets , including " The Matrix Reloaded , " and " Dr. Dolittle 2 , " " Star Trek : Nemesis , " and " Karate Kid II . "
We 're told the victim is Michael John Van Dyke .
Van Dyke was 48 - years - old , and was listed as a prop foreman for the remake of " Psycho . "
Sources say Van Dyke was a long - time friend of the contractor hired on Gibson 's property and was going through financial troubles .
He had no connection to Gibson .
We 've learned Michael went through a messy , protracted divorce a few years ago .
People who worked with him on the " Star Trek : Nemesis " set say he was in desperate financial shape .
His ex-wife is a hair stylist for movies .
Van Dyke had a twin brother , Robert , who also works construction in the film business .
Web - based tool to test your broadband connection for Bittorrent throttling
Testing whether your ISP is throttling Bittorrent used to be a rather complicated undertaking .
The EFF came up with a guide that , among other things , asks you to " disable TCP and UDP checksum offloading and TCP segmentation offloading . "
Riiight .
The Live CD previously mentioned on P2P Blog simplified tests quite a bit , but it still involved teaming up with another user of the same ISP .
But things are becoming even easier with a new web - based tool developed at the Max Planck Institute for Software Systems in Saarbruecken , Germany .
From its website Users just have to run a Java applet on their machine that tries to up - and download data via Bittorrent to and from the Institute 's server .
The tool tests different ports , so users will know whether their ISP is just blocking a certain port or interfering will all Bittorrent transfers .
P2P Blog tested the tool from residential Comcast line , and it accurately diagnosed a manipulation of the upload traffic .
So how is your provider doing ?
Go ahead , run the test and let us know in the comment section !
Six school districts in line for drug grants
DALLAS — White House drug czar John Walters on Wednesday announced grants totaling $ 1.67 million for random student drug testing at six Texas school districts , including two in the Houston area .
While acknowledging that student drug testing is controversial , he said it can help parents intervene early in a child 's addiction .
He also added that the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that such testing is confidential and cannot be used to punish .
The six school districts getting the grants are : Bloomington , Ennis , Friendswood , Ganado , La Porte and Mission .
The money will help them develop or expand random drug testing programs .

Trump and Biden trade barbs , interruptions in chaotic presidential debate
U.S. President Donald Trump and Democratic challenger Joe Biden squared off Tuesday night in their crucial first debate of the 2020 campaign , the most pivotal opportunity yet for them to outline starkly different visions for a country facing multiple crises .
" Please Vote for Me " Is on Youtube !
A few months ago I raved about a 45 minute Chinese documentary I caught randomly on PBS .
It was easily the best movie I saw last year .
Although I downloaded a bittorrent of it , I am excited to find it on Youtube in 5 parts .
Here ’s Part 1 , Part 2 , Part 3 , Part 4 and Part 5 .
It focuses on a classroom activity of an elementary school class ( probably 3rd or 4th grade ) .
The teacher stages an election for the position of class monitor , and three students “ campaign ” to win the position .
At first glance , the documentary appears to have a political subject , but in fact the political aspects are not as important as the social aspects .
How are Chinese children being educated ?
How do Chinese parents take care of their children ?
How do children react when given an open - ended assignment where the rules are not so clear ?
How do parents ( more aware of the political implications of the activity ) prepare for it ?
How does an adventurous teacher manage a social experiment that seems to have gone too far ( while it ’s being captured on film ) ?
How does the Chinese elementary school compare to the American elementary school ?
The children ’s activity is spontaneous , hilarious and thought - provoking .
The helpful parents provide a glimpse of what the typical 1 child Chinese family is like .
So often our perceptions of a country are shaped by its political leaders , its scandals and its violent movies ; it is refreshing to see a more realistic portrayal of the Chinese family .
Although the presence of the video producer definitely affected how kids behaved in the classroom , for the most part the children accepted its presence without giving it a second thought .
It ’s also a fun film ; almost any person watching will trigger memories of how young and fresh we were when we were 8 years old .
The editing and camerawork captures the group dynamics , the cliques and the habits of schoolchildren : the girl jumping up to erase the chalkboard , the boy playing around with a bottle .
The experiment performed in the classroom was dangerous and probably not one I would do in an elementary classroom ( and it is no surprise that the Chinese government would forbid this film from being shown inside China ) .
The three candidates have different personalities , and it ’s interesting how each tries to use it for his or her advantage .
It ’s in essence a popularity contest , and one wonders if that ’s all politics really is .
Actually this classroom experiment has a lot of similarities with conventional politics : overheated rhetoric , advice from pundits , superficial reconciliations , accusations and favors .
Here ’s some audience reaction to the film ( including a link to this excellent American documentary about a similar elementary school experiment ) , other IMDB reviews , a statement from the filmmaker , and his thoughts about how the film was made .
デザインとコードレビューに関する興味深い記事( source ) でKirk Knoernschild 氏( source ) は、レビューを行うということは、ソフトウェアの品質を改善することを約束し、基準の順守を保証し、そして価値ある開発者の教育ツールとなると述べている。しかしながら、レビューの実施方法にその効果は左右される。レビューは、ある組織ではソフトウェア開発工程で本当に意味のあるものであるかもしれないが、その一方で別の組織では形式的なお役所仕事の一部となってしまっているかも知れない。
彼は最も酷いレビューのいくつかの例を次のように挙げている。
コーディングを行った開発者を脅したり攻撃したりする魔女狩りレビュー
深刻な問題は放っておいて、記述方法やインデントについて注力する中括弧論争レビュー
レビュアーが事前にコードを見ることがなく、また事前準備もない状態でレビューに臨む盲目レビュー
コードの一部のみをレビュー対象とし大事な箇所が対象として除外されてしまう除外レビュー
レビューを行うことが不可能である、またレビューをしたとしても効果のないくらいコードベースが大きくなってから行う紙の無駄使いレビュー
プロジェクト管理上こなさなければならない形式的に実施するトークンレビュー
大多数がプロジェクトに関係なく開発者を威嚇するために存在するような多人数で実施するワールドレビュー
Kirk 氏は効果的なレビューを行うために次のように考えている。チームはできるだけレビュープロセスの自動化に取り組みメトリクスを集めるべきである。また、チームは開発者がコードチェックの準備をする前に間違いに気が付くことができるように、開発環境にレビュー結果をフィードバックするメカニズムを組み込むことに取り組むべきである。
彼は客観性と明確なレビュー観点をレビュープロセスにもたらすための助けとなるいくつかのツールを紹介している。
Kirk氏はさらに20%レビューという名の興味深いレビュー実践方法について言及している。
20 % レビューは、開発の20%が完了した時点で一度レビューを行うべきである、という非常にシンプルな考え方に基づくレビュー手法である。いくつかのチームはイテレーションごとに20%レビューを実施することでその有効性に気が付くかも知れない。それは確かに効果的であるが、チームが継続的なレビューのためのメトリクスを使用して良い仕事をしていた場合、システムの主要機能ごとに20%レビューを行うことで十分であると私は思う。
20%レビューは初期のデザインやコードをクリーンにすることに集中すべきだ。コードの量が比較的管理できる間は、メトリクスはコードの進化と成長を促進させる。
レビューを行う助けとなるメトリクスを用いることはレビュープロセスに客観性と明確なレビュー観点をもたらすということを、彼は強調している。優れており、自動化されていて、且つ簡易なメトリクスを用いることは有効なレビューをすることにつながる。レビューはまた、開発者がレビューで得た知識を早期に活用できるように、そしてレビューの有効性を低くしないためにも、十分早期に行うべきである。

In Baghdad alone , nearly a million people have fled their homes .
Last month saw the sharpest rise so far in the numbers of Iraqis forced to abandon their homes - 71.1 % .
The forced migration raises questions about claims from the Bush administration that the civilian protection plan at the core of its war strategy is making Iraq safer for Iraqis .
Instead , data compiled by Red Crescent staff and volunteers in Iraq 's 18 provinces suggests many Iraqis have failed to find real safety or sustainable living conditions after being forced to leave their homes .
Some families have been uprooted twice or even three times in search of safety , affordable housing , functioning water and electricity , adequate schools , and jobs .
More than three - quarters of the displaced were women , and children under 12 , reducing families to poverty , and compounding the sense of social dislocation .
" The men who were the breadwinners are no longer part of the family .
They either fled or joined armed groups , " the report said .
The vast internal exile began after the bombing of Shia shrines at Samara in February 2006 ignited Iraq 's sectarian war .
Thousands of Shias fled Sunni majority neighbourhoods and headed for the south , where they are in the majority .
Sunnis fled Shia enclaves for the north and west of the country .
Christians also left their homes in Sunni areas for Kurdistan .
Some two million Iraqis left the country .
Now a further wave of migration is under way as Iraqis discover they can not survive in their original havens .
Unlike the earlier flights , the current movements are not easily categorised by ethnicity .
" Our understanding is that people are just moving to where they feel safer , " said Tim Irwin , a spokesman for the United Nations high commissioner for refugees in Washington .
Although Baghdad is divided largely on ethnic lines by the Tigris , with Sunnis on the west bank and Shias on the east , some Iraqis are seeking safety in mixed and more secular neighbourhoods which have a better level of services .
" It was fair to say at the beginning of that movement that it was ethnically based and religious based , " Mr Irwin said .
" People were moving to areas where their ethnicity was in the majority .
But with these secondary movements , these third movements , people are continuing to look for safety and security and that may be in homogeneous areas , or it may be in more mixed areas . "
The data from the Iraqi Red Crescent suggests that violence followed many families to their new neighbourhoods , forcing a second flight .
In other cases families were forced to move on from shelters in schools or government buildings because they were being shelled .
Some families were made to feel unwelcome in their place of refugee .
The local authorities in Najaf and Kerbala , for example , have refused to take in migrants who were not born there .
Others moved on because they were becoming a burden to relations who had taken them in .
Still others left because there were no schools for their children .
" Schools witnessed a significant increase in the number of students in each classroom .
Many schools are operating two shifts to accommodate the growing number of students , " the report said .
The constant movement and a lack of amenities have taken a heavy toll on the fabric of Iraqi society , the report warned .
" Some teenagers who lost loved ones joined the armed groups and started taking revenge on innocent people from different ethnic groups .
Rape , armed gangs , theft , drug addiction was commonplace , " it said .
" The overall picture is that of a human tragedy unprecedented in Iraq 's history . "
Not content to push the edge in cloning , architecture and geological engineering , China 's also leaving the rest of the world behind when it comes to controlling the weather .
A few years ago , Australian journalist John Taylor reported ,
It 's uncanny living in Beijing how it rains on the eve of major events .
Be it a big domestic event , or a visiting foreign politician , the rain has usually fallen the day before , making for temporary blue skies free of the normal haze .
Chinese officials say cloud seeding has helped to relieve severe droughts and water shortages in cities .
In Shanghai officials are considering the measure to cool the daytime temperature , easing demand for electricity .
When next summer 's Olympics roll around , the Beijing Weather Modification Office will be poised to intercept incoming clouds , draining them before they get to the festivities .
No fewer than 32,000 people nationwide are employed by the Weather Modification Office – " some of them farmers , who are paid $ 100 a month to handle anti-aircraft guns__ __and rocket launchers " loaded with cloud - seeding compounds .
Some estimate that up to 50 billion tons of artificial rain will be produced by 2010 .
But Taylor noted that this has resulted in competition between cities to seed clouds first , and bitter acrimony when when region receives water claimed by another .
During my cloud seeding reportage , a few weather modification scientists praised China 's initiative .
My gut instinct was to focus on China 's less - than - stellar human rights record and just say , " Well , it 's easy to mess with the weather when there 's no paperwork to fill out or reparations to pay if you flood a village or turn a county into desert . "
But that 's reductionist .
At some level , it 's about vision and will – and China 's got it .
Said Bill Woodley , a weather modification researcher who spent several decades running cloud seeding experiments for NOAA ,
" There 's much we do n't know , as compared to China , where investment is
100 million a year .
They 're training young scientists and pilots ;
they 've just gone crazy there .
It 's the epicenter of all weather modification activity .
They 're pushing hard .
Whereas in the United
States , the amount of money invested by any government is probably in the hundreds of thousands of dollars , if that .
For a country our size , not much is being invested .
Interestingly , when I opined that this was a shame , because with all the billions of federal dollars spent uselessly elsewhere , the government ought to shake a few million weather modification dollars out of the White House sofa , Woodley seemed a bit chagrined .
You can't just throw money at it , he said – there needs to be strong oversight , someone to make sure the research is first - rate , and so on .
He mentioned a couple of weather modification research bills now creeping through Congress – one introduced by Mark Udall ( D - Colorado ) , the other pushed by Kay Bailey Hutchinson ( R - Texas ) .
If you think weather modification research is a good idea , go get your democratic participation on .

Last night on The Colbert Report , Steven sat down with Jacob Weisberg , author of the book The Bush Tragedy .
The premise of Weisberg 's book is that President Bush spent the first part of his life trying to be just like his father -- being a pilot , playing baseball , being a businessman , failing miserably at all -- but later in life decided he wanted to be the opposite of his father , i.e. raising taxes and leaving Saddam Hussein in power .
As we all know , history will say Junior went too far in that endeavor , but Colbert heartily defends him , saying Bush Sr. should n't have left Saddam in power ;

“ The British Army provided security cordons around meetings between two senior British intelligence officers and leading members of the group responsible for producing the opium that is used to make 90 % of the world ’s heroin . ”
— Britain in Secret Talks with the Taliban
But it gets so much better !
The British Secret Intelligence Service ( SIS , or more popularly “ MI6 ” ) was going to run a covert operation that would have been tasked with providing combat training to the Taliban / enemy / terrorists / etc. as well as , “ vocational training , including farming and irrigation techniques . ”
The article states that the purpose of the “ vocational training ” would have provided the Taliban fighters with an alternative to growing opium .
In addition , the Taliban were to receive satellite phones so that they would have been able to communicate directly with their British handlers .
Ahhh !
I get it !
The Taliban could use the satellite phones to call the British spooks after an especially good vegetable harvest .
* wink *
I find this part interesting as well :
President Karzai ’s spokesman , Humayun Hamidzada , accused Mr Semple and Mr Patterson of being “ involved in some activities that were not their jobs . ”
If the spooks were n’t doing their jobs , how did they get the British Army to provide security for them to…uh … not do their jobs ?
What you have here , in my opinion , is a turf war between narcotics gangs .
The Brits wanted a bigger cut .
Obviously , the U.S. puppet regime does n’t say anything about the opium because they ’re bathing in the stuff themselves .
They just gave those British spooks the boot .
Persona non grata .
Bye bye .
Wrist slap .
Do n’t try to slice off a bigger piece of Uncle Sam ’s opium pie next time , chaps .
That ’s just a guess , of course .
Maybe Her Majesty ’s Royal Spooks , with the secret combat training camp and satellite phones , really wanted to teach 2,000 Taliban fighters how to grow better tomatoes .
* double plus wink *
Via : Independent :
Britain planned to build a Taliban training camp for 2,000 fighters in southern Afghanistan , as part of a top - secret deal to make them swap sides , intelligence sources in Kabul have revealed .
The plans were discovered on a memory stick seized by Afghan secret police in December .
The Afghan government claims they prove British agents were talking to the Taliban without permission from the Afghan President , Hamid Karzai , despite Gordon Brown ’s pledge that Britain will not negotiate .
The Prime Minister told Parliament on 12 December : “ Our objective is to defeat the insurgency by isolating and eliminating their leaders .
We will not enter into any negotiations with these people . ”
The British insist President Karzai ’s office knew what was going on .
But Mr Karzai has expelled two top diplomats amid accusations they were part of a plot to buy - off the insurgents .
The row was the first in a series of spectacular diplomatic spats which has seen Anglo - Afghan relations sink to a new low .
Since December , President Karzai has blocked the appointment of Paddy Ashdown to the top UN job in Kabul and he has blamed British troops for losing control of Helmand .
It has also soured relations between Kabul and Washington , where State Department officials were instrumental in pushing Lord Ashdown for the UN role .
President Karzai ’s political mentor , Sibghatullah Mojaddedi , endorsed a death sentence for blasphemy on the student journalist Sayed Pervez Kambaksh last week , and two British contractors have been arrested in Kabul on , it is claimed , trumped up weapons charges .
The developments are seen as a deliberate defiance of the British .
An Afghan government source said the training camp was part of a British plan to use bands of reconciled Taliban , called Community Defence Volunteers , to fight the remaining insurgents .
“ The camp would provide military training for 1,800 ordinary Taliban fighters and 200 low - level commanders , ” he said .
The computer memory stick at the centre of the row was impounded by officers from Afghanistan ’s KGB - trained National Directorate of Security after they moved against a party of international diplomats who were visiting Helmand .
A ministry insider said : “ When they were arrested , the British said the Ministry of the Interior and the National Security Council knew about it , but no one knew anything .
That ’s why the President was so angry . ”
Details of how much President Karzai was told remain murky .
Some analysts believe Afghan officials were briefed about the plan , but that it later evolved .
The camp was due to be built outside Musa Qala , in Helmand .
It was part of a package of reconstruction and development incentives designed to win trust and support in the aftermath of the British - led battle to retake the stronghold last year .
But the Afghans feared the British were training a militia with no loyalty to the central government .
Intercepted Taliban communications suggested they thought the British were trying to help them , the Afghan official said .
The Western delegates , Michael Semple and Mervyn Patterson , were given 48 hours to leave the country .
Their Afghan colleagues , including a former army general , were jailed .
The expulsions coincided with a row within the Taliban ’s ranks which saw a senior commander , Mansoor Dadullah , sacked for talking to British spies .
One official claimed the camp was planned for Mansoor and his men .
The computer stick contained a three - stage plan , called the European Union Peace Building Programme .
The third stage covered military training .
Curiously , the European Union says the programme did not exist and there were no EU funds to run it .
Afghan government officials insist it was bankrolled by the British .
UK diplomats , the UN , Western officials and senior Afghan officials have all confirmed the outline of the plan , which they agree is entirely British - led , but all refused to talk about it on the record .
President Karzai ’s office claimed it was “ a matter of national security ” .
The memory stick revealed that $ 125,000 ( £ 64,000 ) had been spent on preparing the camp and a further $ 200,000 was earmarked to run it in 2008 , an Afghan official said .
The figures sparked allegations that British agents were paying the Taliban .
President Karzai ’s spokesman , Humayun Hamidzada , accused Mr Semple and Mr Patterson of being “ involved in some activities that were not their jobs . ”
The camp would also have provided vocational training , including farming and irrigation techniques , to offer people a viable alternative to growing opium .
But the Afghan government took issue with plans to provide military training , to turn the insurgents into a defence force .
Afghan government staff also claimed the “ EU peace - builders ” had handed over mobile phones , laptops and airtime credit to insurgents .
They said the memory stick revealed plans to train the Taliban to use secure satellite phones , so they could communicate directly with UK officials .
Mr Patterson , a Briton , was the third - ranking UN diplomat when he was held .
Mr Semple , an Irishman , was the acting head of the EU mission .
Officially , the British embassy remains tight - lipped , fuelling speculation that the plan may have been part of a wider clandestine operation .
A spokesman repeated the line used since Christmas : “ The EU and UN have responded to inquiries on this .
We have nothing further to add . ”
But privately , the UN maintains it had no role in setting up the camp .
Meanwhile , Mr Semple ’s EU boss , Francesc Vendrell , admitted he had very little idea what was going on .
Yet the British ambassador , Sir Sherard Cowper - Coles , cut short his Christmas holiday to meet President Karzai and “ spell out the Foreign Office paper - trail ” which diplomats claim proves his government had agreed .
They met twice , but it was not enough to stop Mr Semple and Mr Patterson being forced to leave .
Gordon Brown has also said Britain would increase its support for “ community defence initiatives , where local volunteers are recruited to defend homes and families modelled on traditional Afghan arbakai ” .
Background to the proposal
* December 11
British and Afghan troops take Musa Qala , a Taliban stronghold in Helmand , after President Hamid Karzai reveals that a senior Taliban commander swapped sides .
* December 23 - 24
The acting head of the EU mission , Michael Semple , and the third - ranking UN diplomat in Afghanistan , Mervyn Patterson , hold talks with local dignitaries and Taliban sympathisers in Helmand .
Afghan secret police arrest their colleague , General Stanikzai , and seize a memory stick containing plans for training camps .
* December 25
Semple and Patterson are given 48 hours in which to leave Kabul .
* December 27
The two diplomats fly out of the Afghan capital , despite international appeals to let them stay .

January 1940 : Ida May Fuller of Brattleboro , Vermont becomes top of pyramid scheme .
Seniors hurt in Ponzi scam " headlined the story of elderly Southern Californians bilked in a pyramid scheme .
While sad , the story reminded me of Social Security , since it is also a Ponzi scheme involving those older , with high payoffs to early recipients coming from pockets of later participants .
With Social Security , however , it benefits those older at others ' expense .
Pyramid scams collapse when they run out of enough new " investors " to pay earlier promises .
Some use this fact to deny that Social Security is really a massive redistribution scheme , since it has lasted over 70 years .
That assertion misses two substantial differences between Social Security and other Ponzi schemes however : Social Security involves far longer generations , with people collecting on current promises far into the future ; and it has been not one , but a series of Ponzi schemes .
Since Social Security began , each of the many times it has been expanded , those in or near retirement got benefits far exceeding their costs .
Those already retired paid no added taxes , and those near retirement paid more for only a few years .
But both groups received increased benefits for the rest of their lives .
However , such " generosity " must be paid for by someone else , forcing later generations not only to finance their own retirements , but also to cover the unfunded benefits given early retirees .
Therefore , the good deal Social Security has given retirees ( e.g. , Ida Fuller , Social Security 's first retiree , received benefits 924 times her contributions ) does nothing to prove it is not a Ponzi scheme ; instead , it demonstrates why it is .
Social Security has been sustained only by repeated expansion .
Originally applied only to private - sector workers , it has been expanded to farmers , self - employed workers , non-profit workers , the military and government workers , with each expansion starting a new Ponzi cycle benefiting older Americans , while leaving the tab to later generations .
Disability and dependents ' benefits were added by 1960 .
Medicare was added in 1965 , and benefits have been expanded ( e.g. , Medicare Part B , three quarters financed by others , and the new prescription drug benefit ) .
Social Security benefits have been dramatically increased .
They doubled between 1950 and 1952 .
They were raised 15 % in 1970 , 10 % in 1971 , and 20 % in 1972 in a competition to buy the elderly vote .
Benefits were tied to a measure that effectively double - counted inflation , and even now , benefits are indexed to the CPI , which overstates inflation , raising real benefit levels over time .
The massive expansion of Social Security is evident from the increased tax burden since its $ 60 per year initial maximum .
Tax rates have risen and been applied to more earnings , so that Social Security and Medicare took 15.3 % of earnings up to $ 97,500 in 2007 ( Medicare taxes also apply beyond that income level ) , with further increases scheduled and still more proposed .
Social Security 's good deal for retirees has resulted from a series of Ponzi schemes to benefit those then older at the expense of later generations .
That is why the system is in perpetual crisis now , always seeking new sources of money to keep the system of massive overcommitments from imploding .
And with expansion tricks nearly exhausted and baby boom retirements starting , it will only get worse .
Social Security 's " success " for seniors consists only in multiple expansions that have resulted in a fourteen - digit unfunded liability , imposing a very bad deal on the rest of us .
And those burdens grow each year .
But even worse than private Ponzi schemes , government has required each generation of " suckers " to participate .
The fact that Social Security 's generational highjacking is politically well established does n't make it ethically legitimate .
We send private Ponzi scheme organizers to prison for good reason .
The puzzle is why people laud government for doing the same thing on a far greater scale — why we see no headlines reading , " Seniors hurt others in Ponzi scam . "
Rogue archivist Carl Malamud writes :
Paul Jones of iBiblio tipped me off to some recent M&A activity by Microsoft , this time involving the Library of Congress .
This deal involves the donation of " technology , services and funding " ( e.g. , mostly not money ) with a purported value of $ 3 m from Microsoft to the Library of Congress .
The Library , in turn , agrees to put kiosks running Vista in the library and to use Microsoft Silverlight to " help power the library 's new Web site , www.myloc.gov. "
The official blogger of the library , Matt Raymond , says " this is really a quantum leap for the library . "
Perhaps it is , but it sure smells like a whole lot of proprietary .
Did they think the Hamburglar was there or something ?
Why is George Bush trying to divert America ’s attention from his scandalous failures at home ?
Is n’t that how their tired old story went during the Clinton years ?
Either way , the hyped attack was yet another flop .
The attack was the fourth known strike by the US inside Somalia since it backed Ethiopia ’s invasion of the country in December 2006 .
All have been aimed at men Washington believes to be responsible for terrorist attacks in East Africa .
None has been successful .

Indeed , it is somewhat surprising that there is not already rioting in the streets , given the gigantic fraud perpetrated by the financial elite at the expense of ordinary Americans .
A leading economic journalist has described the current financial crisis as a " gigantic fraud " , the fallout of a deliberate and preconceived profit agenda to enslave the middle classes in a debt bubble .
The economics editor of the London Guardian , Larry Elliott , has hit out at the global financial elite in a refreshing piece that marks a rare shift away from the establishment hackery we are used to from the corporate media .
In an article titled America was conned – who will pay ?
Elliot writes :
Indeed , it is somewhat surprising that there is not already rioting in the streets , given the gigantic fraud perpetrated by the financial elite at the expense of ordinary Americans . [ … ]
Business , of course , needs consumers to carry on spending in order to make money , so a way had to be found to persuade households to do their patriotic duty .
The method chosen was simple .
Whip up a colossal housing bubble , convince consumers that it makes sense to borrow money against the rising value of their homes to supplement their meagre real wage growth and watch the profits roll in .
As they did – for a while .
Now it ’s payback time and the mood could get very ugly .
Americans , to put it bluntly , have been conned .
They have been duped by a bunch of serpent - tongued hucksters who packed up the wagon and made it across the county line before a lynch mob could be formed .
Elliot also states that the debate is now not about whether the US faces a recession , but is about how deep it will be and how long it will last , comparing the downturn to the South Sea Bubble crisis in 1720 , and declaring that the " Ponzi securitisation scam has been exposed . "
A Ponzi scheme , named after Charles Ponzi , is one that offers abnormally high short - term returns in order to entice new investors .
The high returns that a Ponzi scheme advertises and pays require an ever - increasing flow of money from investors in order to keep the scheme going , meaning it is inevitable that it will eventually collapse .
Elliot , like former chief economist of the World Bank turned whistleblower , Joseph Stiglitz , points a finger of blame squarely at former Fed chairman Alan Greenspan , stating :
" In the longer term , lessons must be learnt from the turmoil .
One is that you do n’t solve the problems of a collapsing bubble by blowing up another , which is what Alan Greenspan did after the dotcom fiasco in 2001 – the most irresponsible behaviour of any central banker in living memory . "
Last week we highlighted the fact that Greenspan , instead of trying to act to reverse the damage he has done to the US economy , is actively encouraging its further demise by urging foreign states to abandon their dollar peg .
Another cogent point Larry Elliot makes is the following :
" If this is , heaven help us , The Big One , one of the only consolations will be that the repugnance at the orgy of speculation that has sapped the strength of the US economy will put a new New Deal on the political agenda . "
Last week we highlighted the fact that Greenspan , instead of trying to act to reverse the damage he has done to the US economy , is actively encouraging its further demise by urging foreign states to abandon their dollar peg .
It should be added that , given that this crisis has been engineered by a financial elite Ponzi scheme , we should be extremely wary of any " new deal " that is brokered by the financial and political elite posing as our saviors .
There are already talks of a " new world order " emerging from the fallout of the current economic meltdown .
A consolidation among the big financial institutions does not spell good news for ordinary Americans and people across the world who have been effectively herded into this current crisis by the financial elite .
We , along with others such as Stiglitz , have repeatedly warned of the quickening of an agenda of economic catastrophe allied to the " solution " of predatory globalism .
Nevertheless , while CNN and other mainstream outlets continue to parade economic " experts " who ludicrously suggest that the destruction of the dollar and the economic downturn is " not necessarily a bad thing " for America , it is a refreshing change to read a mainstream report that actually hints at the reality of the situation the US and the rest of the world now faces at the hands of the elite .

Obama : ' If I am not ready , how is it that you think I should be such a great vice president ? '
Obama : ' If I am not ready , how is it that you think I should be such a great vice president ? '
My colleague Carrie Budoff Brown e-mails from Columbus , Miss. , with Obama 's response to the Clintons ' flotation of the notion that he could be her veep : scorn .
COLUMBUS , Miss -- Sen. Barack Obama delivered an animated rebuke today of suggestions from the Clintons in recent days that he could run as her vice president .
“ Now first of all with all due respect , with all due respect , " he said here during a town hall meeting .
" I won twice as many states as Sen. Clinton .
I won more of the popular vote than Sen. Clinton .
I have more delegates than Sen. Clinton .
So I do n’t ’ know how someone in second place can offer the vice presidency to someone in first place .
If I was in second place I could understand but I am in first place right now .
He referenced comments from Bill Clinton in 1992 that his “ most important criteria ” for vice president was that person must be ready to be commander in chief .
“ They have been spending the last two or three weeks ” arguing that he is not ready to be commander in chief , Obama said .
“ I do n’t understand .
If I am not ready , how is it that you think I should be such a great vice president ? ”
Obama asked the crowd , which gave him a standing ovation during his defense .
“ I do n’t understand . ”
“ You ca n’t say he is not ready on day one , then you want him to be your vice president , ” Obama continued .
“ I just want everybody to absolutely clear : I am not running for vice president .
I am running to be president of the United States of America . ”

A drug that could prevent thousands of young women developing breast cancer has been created by scientists .
If given regularly to those with a strong family history of the cancer , researchers say it could effectively " vaccinate " them against a disease they are almost certain to develop .
The drug , which attacks tumours caused by genetic flaws , could spare those who have the rogue genes the trauma of having their breasts removed .
Currently , a high proportion of women told they have inherited the rogue genes choose to have a mastectomy as a preventative measure .
Researchers hope such a " vaccine " will be available within a decade .
Flawed BRCA genes , which are passed from mother to daughter , are responsible for around 2,000 of the 44,000 cases of breast cancer each year in the UK .
Women with the rogue genes have an 85 per cent chance of developing the disease - eight times that of the average woman .
Initial tests suggest that the drug , known only as AGO14699 , could also be free of the side - effects associated with other cancer treatments , including pain , nausea and hair loss .
The drug , which is being tested on patients in Newcastle upon Tyne , works by exploiting the " Achilles ' heel " of hereditary forms of breast cancer - which is its limited ability to repair damage to its DNA .
Normal cells have two ways of fixing themselves , allowing them to grow and replicate , but cells in BRCA tumours have only one .
The drug , which is part of the class of anti-cancer medicines called PARP inhibitors , blocks this mechanism and stops the tumour cells from multiplying .
The researchers say the drug could also be used against other forms of cancer , including prostate and pancreatic , although further tests are needed .
Researcher Dr Ruth Plummer , senior lecturer in medical oncology at Newcastle University , said : " The implications for women and their families are huge because if you have the gene , there is a 50 per cent risk you will pass it on to your children .
You are carrying a time bomb . "
I 'd been assuming that Hillary Clinton was n't going to contest Wyoming , on the grounds that caucus states , red states , and all - white states normally do n't count , but it seems she 's in it to win it according to Politico :
Now she has five staffers on the ground in Wyoming , where caucuses take place Saturday and where 18 delegates are at stake .
Bill Clinton will make three stops there Thursday , and local supporters are trying to arrange a visit from the candidate herself Friday , said Kathy Karpan , a former Democratic candidate for Wyoming governor who is one of Clinton ’s leading supporters in the state .
“ I think we can win , ” Karpan said , citing “ the connection that the Clintons have with people in our state , ” a network of support built during their White House years , when they vacationed at Jackson Hole .
Interesting .
I think everyone 's mentally pencilled Wyoming in as an Obama state , but of course there 's been no polling there nor was there in the other Wyoming - esque states that Obama won earlier in the cycle .
Nobody really knows what such innovations as staff and candidate visits might be able to do for Clinton 's fortunes .

Lock -In
Buying an iPhone is n’t the same as buying a car or a toaster .
Your iPhone comes with a complicated list of rules about what you can and ca n’t do with it .
You ca n’t install unapproved third - party applications on it .
You ca n’t unlock it and use it with the cellphone carrier of your choice .
And Apple is serious about these rules : A software update released in September 2007 erased unauthorized software and — in some cases — rendered unlocked phones unusable .
“ Bricked ” is the term , and Apple is n’t the least bit apologetic about it .
Computer companies want more control over the products they sell you , and they ’re resorting to increasingly draconian security measures to get that control .
The reasons are economic .
Control allows a company to limit competition for ancillary products .
With Mac computers , anyone can sell software that does anything .
But Apple gets to decide who can sell what on the iPhone .
It can foster competition when it wants , and reserve itself a monopoly position when it wants .
And it can dictate terms to any company that wants to sell iPhone software and accessories .
This increases Apple ’s bottom line .
But the primary benefit of all this control for Apple is that it increases lock - in .
“ Lock - in ” is an economic term for the difficulty of switching to a competing product .
For some products — cola , for example — there ’s no lock - in .
I can drink a Coke today and a Pepsi tomorrow : no big deal .
But for other products , it ’s harder .
Switching word processors , for example , requires installing a new application , learning a new interface and a new set of commands , converting all the files ( which may not convert cleanly ) and custom software ( which will certainly require rewriting ) , and possibly even buying new hardware .
If Coke stops satisfying me for even a moment , I ’ll switch : something Coke learned the hard way in 1985 when it changed the formula and started marketing New Coke .
But my word processor has to really piss me off for a good long time before I ’ll even consider going through all that work and expense .
Lock - in is n’t new .
It ’s why all gaming - console manufacturers make sure that their game cartridges do n’t work on any other console , and how they can price the consoles at a loss and make the profit up by selling games .
It ’s why Microsoft never wants to open up its file formats so other applications can read them .
It ’s why music purchased from Apple for your iPod wo n’t work on other brands of music players .
It ’s why every U.S. cellphone company fought against phone number portability .
It ’s why Facebook sues any company that tries to scrape its data and put it on a competing website .
It explains airline frequent flyer programs , supermarket affinity cards and the new My Coke Rewards program .
With enough lock - in , a company can protect its market share even as it reduces customer service , raises prices , refuses to innovate and otherwise abuses its customer base .
It should be no surprise that this sounds like pretty much every experience you ’ve had with IT companies :
Once the industry discovered lock - in , everyone started figuring out how to get as much of it as they can .
Economists Carl Shapiro and Hal Varian even proved that the value of a software company is the total lock - in .
Here ’s the logic : Assume , for example , that you have 100 people in a company using MS Office at a cost of $ 500 each .
If it cost the company less than $ 50,000 to switch to Open Office , they would .
If it cost the company more than $ 50,000 , Microsoft would increase its prices .
Mostly , companies increase their lock - in through security mechanisms .
Sometimes patents preserve lock - in , but more often it ’s copy protection , digital rights management ( DRM ) , code signing or other security mechanisms .
These security features are n’t what we normally think of as security :
They do n’t protect us from some outside threat , they protect the companies from us .
Microsoft has been planning this sort of control - based security mechanism for years .
First called Palladium and now NGSCB ( Next - Generation Secure Computing Base ) , the idea is to build a control - based security system into the computing hardware .
The details are complicated , but the results range from only allowing a computer to boot from an authorized copy of the OS to prohibiting the user from accessing “ unauthorized ” files or running unauthorized software .
The competitive benefits to Microsoft are enormous ( .pdf ) .
Of course , that ’s not how Microsoft advertises NGSCB .
The company has positioned it as a security measure , protecting users from worms , Trojans and other malware .
But control does not equal security ; and this sort of control - based security is very difficult to get right , and sometimes makes us more vulnerable to other threats .
Perhaps this is why Microsoft is quietly killing NGSCB — we ’ve gotten BitLocker , and we might get some other security features down the line — despite the huge investment hardware manufacturers made when incorporating special security hardware into their motherboards .
In my last column , I talked about the security - versus - privacy debate , and how it ’s actually a debate about liberty versus control .
Here we see the same dynamic , but in a commercial setting .
By confusing control and security , companies are able to force control measures that work against our interests by convincing us they are doing it for our own safety .
As for Apple and the iPhone , I do n’t know what they ’re going to do .
On the one hand , there ’s this analyst report that claims there are over a million unlocked iPhones , costing Apple between $ 300 million and $ 400 million in revenue .
On the other hand , Apple is planning to release a software development kit this month , reversing its earlier restriction and allowing third - party vendors to write iPhone applications .
Apple will attempt to keep control through a secret application key that will be required by all “ official ” third - party applications , but of course it ’s already been leaked .
And the security arms race goes on …
This essay previously appeared on Wired.com .
EDITED TO ADD ( 2/12 ) : Slashdot thread .
And critical commentary , which is oddly political :
This is n’t lock - in , it ’s called choosing a product that meets your needs .
If you do n’t want to be tied to a particular phone network , do n’t buy an iPhone .
If installing third - party applications ( between now and the end of February , when officially - sanctioned ones will start to appear ) is critically important to you , do n’t buy an iPhone .
It ’s one thing to grumble about an otherwise tempting device not supporting some feature you would find useful ; it ’s another entirely to imply that this represents anti-libertarian lock - in .
The fact remains , you are free to buy one of the many other devices on the market that existed before there ever was an iPhone .
Actually , lock - in is one of the factors you have to consider when choosing a product to meet your needs .
It ’s not one thing or the other .
And lock - in is certainly not “ anti-libertarian . ”
Lock - in is what you get when you have an unfettered free market competing for customers ; it ’s libertarian utopia .
Government regulations that limit lock - in tactics — something I think would be very good for society — is what ’s anti-libertarian .
Here ’s a commentary on that previous commentary .
This is some good commentary , too .

Merkel joins Poland and Czech Republic leaders who will not attend the opening ceremonies .
These leaders are all people who grew up under Soviet domination so they all have first hand experience with a bully regime maintaining power over another country .
Will this tip the balance for other EU leaders to boycott ?
The more important question is whether China will stick to its old ways or join the modern world in terms of both business and respect for human rights .
They can do as they like but it ’s their choice .
It is also everyone else ’s choice not condone China ’s actions .
WATCHING the 2008 presidential campaign , you sometimes get the feeling that the candidates  smart , all of them  must know better .
They must know we ca n’t fix our economy and create jobs by isolating America from global trade .
They must know that we ca n’t fix our immigration problems with border security alone .
They must know that we ca n’t fix our schools without holding teachers , principals and parents accountable for results .
They must know that fighting global warming is not a costless challenge .
And they must know that we ca n’t keep illegal guns out of the hands of criminals unless we crack down on the black market for them .
The vast majority of Americans know that all of this is true , but  politics being what it is  the candidates seem afraid to level with them .
Over the past year , I have been working to raise issues that are important to New Yorkers and all Americans  and to speak plainly about common sense solutions .
Some of these solutions have traditionally been seen as Republican , while others have been seen as Democratic .
As a businessman , I never believed that either party had all the answers and , as mayor , I have seen just how true that is .
In every city I have visited  from Baltimore to New Orleans to Seattle  the message of an independent approach has resonated strongly , and so has the need for a new urban agenda .
More than 65 percent of Americans now live in urban areas  our nation ’s economic engines .
But you would never know that listening to the presidential candidates .
At a time when our national economy is sputtering , to say the least , what are we doing to fuel job growth in our cities , and to revive cities that have never fully recovered from the manufacturing losses of recent decades ?
Each Monday , this column turns a page in history to explore the discoveries , events and people that continue to affect the history being made today .
Ever heard of Qin Shi Huang ?
Maybe not .
But it 's likely you have heard of the country he unified – China – and the Great Wall he built .
Plus , there 's that enormous army of terra -cotta warriors that watches over his mysterious mausoleum .
The world 's most populous nation and emerging superpower was a jumble of warring states when Qin Shi Huang appeared on the scene in 246 B.C. as a powerful regional leader .
Two decades later he was Emperor , bringing together the vast territory that would become China , standardizing its culture and implementing a form of government that his followers would use for another 2,000 years .
Qin Shi Huang ( pronouncerd " chin shuh huang " ) remains a mythical figure in China , still laying in rest in the largest unopened tomb in history , said to contain rivers of mercury and a ceiling covered in precious stones .
Get along
When Qin Shi Huang ascended as ruler of the Qin tribe in 246 B.C. , China had been at war for 200 years .
Seven major states were battling each other for dominance in the land , which was then a patchwork of feudal villages with no central bureaucracy .
After a series of victories , Qin absorbed its last rival in 221 B.C. , unifying China under one leader .
As head of the new empire of China , Qin Shi Huang did n't hesitate to establish a new law of the land .
The Emperor quickly abolished the old feudal system , standardized the Chinese writing and currency systems , built a vast network of roads and canals to link the country and divided China into states with one centralized government .
A noted egomaniac , Qin Shi Huang was also known for building large , extravagant structures .
He was also paranoid of attack from insiders .
Almost immediately after taking power , he began construction on a large wall that would link up bits and pieces of existing defensive walls throughout the country .
This would become the forerunner to the Great Wall that 's still in existence , most of which was completed under a later dynasty .
Tomb to rival the pyramids
Whether he had predicted his eventual greatness or just had a big ego from the start , the eccentric Qin Shi Huang set to work on his own massive mausoleum just shortly after taking power of the Qin tribe at the age of 13 .
It was ready just after his death 36 years later in 210 B.C .
The mausoleum complex covers approximately four square miles near the modern city of Xi'an .
Its main burial chamber is as big as the Great Pyramids of Egypt , but has yet to be excavated because archaeologists do not yet have the means to properly protect what they expect to find inside .
According to a historian writing 100 years after the Emperor 's death , Qin Shi Huang 's burial chamber contains a vast map of the land he conquered , complete with rivers of mercury .
The " sky " ceiling is encrusted with stars made of jewels .
And , like something straight out of an Indiana Jones movie , the entrance to the tomb is booby - trapped with crossbows .
The historian 's accounts of the tomb 's grandeur may have been passed off as a tall tale had a family of peasants not stumbled upon one of the greatest archaeological discoveries of the century in 1974 .
A battalion of 8,000 clay soldiers and horses collectively known as the terra - cotta army was found standing guard near the burial mound , each one life - size and uniquely carved .
Thousands more like them may remain underground within the funerary complex , archaeologists think .
What 's in a name ?
Just three years after Qin Shi Huang 's death in 210 B.C. , the Qin dynasty was overthrown .
The imperial system that he'd set in motion , however , would remain at work in China until 1912 , when the last Emperor abdicated and China became a Republic .
At the very least , Qin 's dynasty , pronounced " chin , " lives on in the country 's name .

We ’ve selected 6 questions , which main purpose was to give fellows designers more insights in practice , and in the experience prominent designers gained during their work over the last 5 - 10 years .
So this time we wanted it to be not about useful coding suggestions or clever CSS - techniques , but about the practical knowledge and personal experience developers would share with us and our readers .
What are the things you should know before starting designing / programming ?
What things should you be aware of ?
How to get your project done ?
In fact , we wanted to take a close look at some practical answers to these questions - from the worlds ’ best designers .

First Three Questions
Since we ’ve received many answers , we ’ve decided to divide the article in two parts ; as you might suggest , each part will cover designers ’ answers to three ( out of six ) questions .
Here are the first three questions we ’ve asked .
As in the first survey , one single text line would have sufficed .
What is one typical myth about web - development ( which is not true ) ?
What is one bulletproof method to get over creativity block ?
What is one thing you wish you knew before you ’ve started programming / designing / … ?
50 Designers x 3 Questions
In August we ’ve contacted over 70 renowned designers , and asked them even more — six — questions .
65 of them agreed on answering the questions in time , however not all of them managed to send the answers till the deadline .
This time over 50 world leading designers , developers and experts have participated , however , not everybody answered all six questions .
So the result is ca. 300 professional suggestions and facts one can learn only from his / her own experience .
We ’d like to thank all designers and developers who participated in our survey and / or were willing to take part it .
Among them are Eric Meyer , Shaun Inman , Veerle Pieters , Carole Guevin ( Netdiver ) , Jakob Nielsen , Patrick Griffiths ( HTMLDog ) , Oliver Reichenstein ( Informationarchitects.jp ) , Meryl K. Evans , D. Keith Robinson , Jonathan Snook , Jina Bolton , Daniel Mall , Cameron Adams , Andy Rutledge , Carolyn Wood ( Digital Web Magazine ) , Andy Peatling , Andy Budd , Christian Montoya , Garrett Dimon , Jason Beaird , Luke Wroblewski , Mike Davidson , Richard Rutter , Dan Rubin , Matt Brett , Paul Boag , Roger Johansson , Russ Weakley , Mark Boulton , Jesse Bennett - Chamberlain and many more .
Thank you !
Please feel free to post your own ideas , suggestions and tips in the comments .
Share your knowledge with fellows developers !
So , let ’s move to the answers , shall we ?
Summary
1 . One typical myth about web - development ( which is not true )
It ’s simple , and anybody can do it .
Myth : Web development is for boys .
Truth : Web development is for Spartan warriors .
People still underestimate the amount of effort that goes into creating a great site or application .
The various components are easy , but putting them together in the right way takes time and experience .
Successful web sites can / should be designed completely in a couple of days .
In reality you ca n’t get a site fast , cheap and good .
You ca n’t have all three .
The fact remains , that even when using open source frameworks to build sites , a truly custom design integration into a customized or even standard CMS is not a task that can be done properly in just a few hours .
Accessible web pages are visually dull .
This is a myth that has been battled against since people started to think about web accessibility .
Unfortunately it is still perpetuated by accessibility consultancies tasked with designing websites , but who do n’t employ actual designers .
Visual design deserves more time and effort than the content .
The content is where it starts and is the reason for the design to exist , yet , so many designers still view copywriting and content creation as “ not my job ” .
On projects where there ’s a dedicated copywriter , that may work .
Unfortunately , that ’s not always the case .
Standards - compliance guarantees a good web site .
There are many young developers out there caring so much for code that they seem to forget everything else , while to be true , a good designed website ( form & function ) with bad code still works better than a bad designed with an awesome code .
Design and best design practices are expensive .
It can only be true if you have n’t yet learned how to develop accessible sites with web standards , in which case it ’s time to start reading .
One aspect of web design is dominant over all of the others .
Usability is often seen as reining supreme .
Although it is incredibly important it needs to be tempered by business objectives , technical constraints and even accessibility considerations .
Some see design as more important than anything , others well written code .
The truth is that web design is about balance .
Absolute separation is possible .
In reality proper use of semantic ( X) HTML and CSS completely abstracts the presentation of a site from its content is impossible .
Feature X is “ not possible .
” Just because it has n’t been done , does n’t mean it ’s not possible .
We ’ve got dozens of tools ( HTML , CSS , Flash ) at our tooltips — do n’t let anyone tell you that it ca n’t be done .
It just has n’t been done yet .
IE is an absolute nightmare to develop for .
It requires a little perseverance to get it there 100 % , but with a little compromise ( graceful degradation ) , you can have it looking pretty much ( 95 % ? ) the same as it does in other browsers .
The “ necessary ” abundant use of hacks .
If your HTML is well structured and you understand how CSS is supposed to work as well as how it does work in different browsers , you need few , if any hacks .
Keeping the various layers of a website is too difficult and requires too much effort for very little return .
If you start with a strict focus on keeping all the layers ( database , server - side code , html , css , javascript ) separate that in the long run you will save yourself a lot of time developing and prevent a lot of headaches too .
Internet Explorer 7 is an improvement over IE6 .
Microsoft was going to deliver a product that would make our lives as web developers easier , but its done nothing but add more garbage to the pile .
Developers can’t be designers , designers ca n’t be developers .
It might seem there is a clear divide between the two , however there are people out there who have no problem being both .
CSS / XHTML is a great middle point , from there you can progressively go either way .
“ Un - design ” sells .
Whomever suggested that should retire .
Ideas sell .
Ideas that look great sell more .
Bad ideas are useless .
Every idea — no matter how dumb — is a potential breakthrough or could lead to a breakthrough .
You ’ve got to document those bad , random ideas .
Plus , you get to save them and revisit them for future inspiration .
2 . One bulletproof method to get over creativity block
Change the perspective : go away .
Go someplace “ different ” from your usual haunts , away from places where you take every object , interaction or decoration for granted .
Step away from the computer .
Go for a walk , head to the gym , or just sleep on the problem .
You ’ll come back refreshed and with a new outlook on the task at hand .
Get inspired .
Be a continuous feedback loop .
That means continuous input : reading books and blogs , attending talks and conferences , using the medium you design for .
It also means continuous output : writing books and blogs , speaking at conferences , designing .
Listen to music .
Listen to music .
Music is an equal blend of emotion and analysis .
If you let yourself be inspired by it , you ’ll often be astonished at the results .
Observe the world .
Take a deep breath , stand up from your computer , and go somewhere you ’ve never been before — a cafe , an exhibition … Prague .
Go lie down in the park and just stare at the world .
Let your mind truly relax and forget about things like the bills , and the rest of it all — suddenly your creativity will kick into overdrive .
Do something entirely different .
Do something else entirely .
Look at things that have nothing necessarily to do with web design .
Get inspiration off - screen .
Seek for a new approach .
Sketch as you go , start over , beat favourite sites in simplicity , consider what would other designers do , refresh your canvas , observe other people using a similar service you ’re designing .
Put creative work on hold .
Put the task or project down and either take a break from work altogether or perform some tasks that require no creativity ( like bookkeeping or organization tasks ) and distract your conscious mind from the challenges .
Communicate .
Go off the grid .
Talk to human beings .
In person .
Do something out of the ordinary , out of character .
Give your brain a chance to regroup and hit it with some fresh stimuli .
Train your creativity .
Force yourself to do something creative every day .
It can be anything : writing , drawing , shooting photos , etc .
The idea is to get into the habit of being creative every day .
3 . One thing I wish I knew before I ’ve started programming / designing
Professional skills .
Grids , working with frameworks , formalized design training , semantic markup , removing the unnecessary , design & art history classes , web standards , networking , macrotypography , everything .
Personal skills .
Good writing , ability to communicate , ability to learn , ability to focus , ability to organize , ability to run things , ability to say “ no ” , ability to solve problems .
Also : know your capabilities , know how to find the right idea and be satisfied with your work .
Your workspace / equipment matters .
Make sure your work environment is exactly how you want it .
You ’ll become less creative .
The more time you spend at the computer , the worse you ’ll become .
You ’ll become more technical .
The job will become more technical and less creative from time to time .
Web is a dynamic medium .
The creative process is much more difficult for a medium with so many unknown variables .
Clients never want something fresh .
Often when clients say they want something new and fresh and different , they do n’t .
The reality of “ new and fresh and different ” can be very frightening to the average business person .
There are many designers , but only few masters .
There are a lot of people in this field , but the vast majority are not great at what they do .
If you can be great in at least one area , you ’ll set yourself above the crowd and will have no problem finding working .
Browser war would never stop .
The browser war and the mindset that lead to them will always be a problem .
Even though the first two wars were the result of Netscape followed by Microsoft , the stagnation and resulting fallout ( legacy incompatibility and proprietary additions to markup ) will always be present .
Knowing that you can make a career out of it .
“ I wish I knew that this was going to be my career .
I would have taken it more seriously when I first got started , and probably would have been further ahead . ”
Knowing that everything you do is wrong .
There is no right way to do things , and when you think you have it figured it all out , everything changes .
Knowing that designer ’s work is sometimes terrible .
Even the best designers have days where they think their work is terrible .
Knowing how much fun it is .
Developing websites is really hard work , and it ’s not always really fun .
But in general working on different projects with clients in TONS of different industries always keeps the job fresh and full of new challenges .
Knowing that you wo n’t be able to switch off .
“ Someone should have told me that I ca n’t switch off .
I know it sounds trite , but being a designer is who I am , not what I do .
Two completely different things . ”
Having a mentor .
“ I wish I knew someone that could have helped me learn what I know now .
I ended up figuring all this out from miscellaneous reading , online and off .
Sure it ’s fun to learn things yourself , but having someone there to tell me what ’s the best way to do things , and more importantly WHY those are the best ways , would have saved me lots of headaches and mistakes . ”
Overview of the answers
1 . One typical myth about web - development ( which is not true )
There are dozens of myths about web - development ; all of them are usually based upon humans ’ intuitition , but does n’t hold in reality .
These typical misunderstandings usually confuse both beginners - developers during their work and clients willing to get an effective and visually appealing web site .
It ’s time to debunk some of them .
Let ’s take a look at some of the wide - spread myths about web design and web - development - myths prominent web - developers had to cope with .
1.1 . Myth : web - development simple , and anybody can do it .
Myth : Web development is for boys .
Truth : Web development is for Spartan warriors .
[ Oliver Reichenstein , Informationarchitects.jp ]
That web designers spend most of their time snowboarding .
This may have been true in 1998 , but it is far from the truth now .
Most of us are chained to our computers 16 hours a day knee - deep in responsibility and to - do lists .
Or is that just me ?
I hope not .
I ’ve never been snowboarding .
[ Simon Collison ]
Easter bunnies are amazing at CSS .
No , really .
They ’re absolutely amazing .
[ Jina Bolton ]
That it ’s a simple process .
More often than not I ’m surprised by developers and designers who do n’t understand everything that ( should , at least ) go into planning and preparing for a website .
Through measurable goals , IA , copy - writing , launch , evaluation and every step in - between , there should be some sort of plan and process .
[ Steve Smith ]
People still underestimate the amount of effort that goes into creating a great site or application .
The various components are easy , but putting them together in the right way takes time and experience .
[ Andy Budd ]
Anybody can do it .
All you need is to buy the tools that the “ pros ” use .
Aka “ Why should I pay you , when Dreamweaver costs less , and I can do it myself ? ” [ Nathan Smith ]
You can build websites without having any knowledge of code .
You can , but you ’ll run into trouble quickly and when you do n’t know what ’s causing it you wo n’t be able to fix it .
By understanding the underlying technique you also are in a better position to grasp semantics .
[ Veerle Pieters ]
you also are in a better position to grasp semantics .
[ Veerle Pieters ]
That it ’s easy .
[ Dan Rubin ]
The intention of Tim Berners - Lee when he invented the ‘ hyperlink ’ was to make sure that vast bodies of research work ( documents ) would be easier to drill down by reinforcing and expanding the presupposed affirmations by hyper linking them .
This way researchers would / could find more meaning and sense of the chaotic sources , thus enhancing endlessly their value .
Keep in mind that the key word here is content .
When the World Wide Web became ( graphical interface over the Internet ) , visual communication was done through ‘ tables ’ which were extensively used for presentation of content .
With the rise of the W3C recommendations and theorganization of the ‘ web ’ professions all deemed tables .. failing this primal directive of this principle of content ruling over presentation .
CSS was then crowned the ‘ way ’ to go .
Fine , but did n’t take into account the difficulty of creating complex user interfaces , how alieniating it would be for ‘ designers ’ to break the layout in lines of code , get absolute positioning , float content and dealing with lack of browser support .
Tables were complex but in comparison , infinitely simpler .
My myth busting : creating a website using CSS is easy .
[ Carole Guevin , Netdiver.net ]
1.2 . Myth : successful web sites can / should be designed completely in a couple of days .
The biggest myth is that you can get a site fast , cheap AND good .
You ca n’t have all three .
You can get it fast and cheap ( but it wo n’t be good ) , good and fast ( but it wo n’t be cheap ) , or you can get it good and cheap ( but it wo n’t be fast ) .
That ’s the designer ’s triangle of truth .
[ Larissa Meek ]
That the best approach is to throw something up as quickly as possible and see if it sticks .
In fact , you can save large amounts of money by only launching things that have a better chance of succeeding because they have already been refined through several rounds of user testing , including paper prototyping which can be done in a day .
[ Jakob Nielsen ]
.

[ Jakob Nielsen ]
Professional web sites can be designed and built in just under a couple weeks ( or similar timelines ) .
While yes it ’s true that a site design could be done a matter of days and CSS / XHTML can be generated in a heartbeat using the various HTML editors on the market .
The fact remains , that even when using open source frameworks to build sites , a truly custom design integration into a customized or even standard CMS is not a task that can be done properly in just a few hours .
Often times clients of any size seem to discount the effort required to design , produce and implement and custom design into a system that they can easily maintain and support on their own .
[ Frederick Townes ]
Myth is that there ’s a point when you are done designing .
Because we are designing for people and people are “ time bound entities moving from cradle to grave ” ( to quote Bruce Sterling ) people ’s problems are always changing .
So really , design is never done .
[ Luke Wroblewski ]
.

[ Luke Wroblewski ]
That web design is finished with an image comp .
Many design shops and ad agencies still believe this and pass on comps to their coders to flesh out .
The truth is that there are more decisions to be made in the XHTML / CSS stage about layout , color and typography than in Photoshop .
[ Jason Beaird ]
1.3 . Myth : Usability + CSS are boring , visually appealing designs are effective .
Usable websites have to be simple and boring .
[ Lucian Slatineanu ]
That CSS - driven designs are all boxy and boring .
You ’d think that one would have died years ago , but I keep on seeing it .
[ Eric A. Meyer ]
Accessible web pages are visually dull .
This is a myth that has been battled against since people started to think about web accessibility .
Unfortunately it is still perpetuated by accessibility consultancies tasked with designing websites , but who do n’t employ actual designers .
[ Richard Rutter ]
The view that visual design deserves more time and effort than the content .
I do n’t know if I ’d call it a myth , but it ’s definitely a common misunderstanding .
The content is where it starts and is the reason for the design to exist , yet , so many designers still view copywriting and content creation as “ not my job ” .
On projects where there ’s a dedicated copywriter , that may work .
Unfortunately , that ’s not always the case .
[ Garrett Dimon ]

[ Garrett Dimon ]
A nice looking site is a successful site .
[ Jason Santa Maria ]
1.4 . Myth : Standards - compliance guarantees a good web site .
That programming with webstandards automatically generates good websites .
There are many young developers out there caring so much for code that they seem to forget everything else , while to be true , a good designed website ( form & function ) with bad code still works better than a bad designed with an awesome code .
[ Markus Stefan ]
The myth that by writing valid , standards - based code , you are automatically creating accessible , SEO friendly sites .
[ Mike Davidson ]
1.5 . Myth : design and best design practices are ( too ) expensive .
“ Web Development is far too expensive .
Even I can do a neat little page with Microsoft Word .
Why should I pay x thousand Euros for a professional designed website ? ” [ Wolfgang Bartelme ]
.
Even I can do a neat little page with Microsoft Word .
Why should I pay x thousand Euros for a professional designed website ? ” [ Wolfgang Bartelme ]
That it costs more to do things right , i.e. follow best practices .
In my opinion it can only be true if you have n’t yet learned how to develop accessible sites with web standards , in which case it ’s time to start reading .
[ Roger Johansson ]
1.6 . Technical myths .
Myth : one aspect of web design is dominant over all of the others .
The most common example of this is with usability .
Usability is often seen as reining supreme .
Although it is incredibly important it needs to be tempered by business objectives , technical constraints and even accessibility considerations .
Some see design as more important than anything , others well written code .
The truth is that web design is about balance .
It is about making the different aspects ( development , usability , accessibility , aesthetics , business objectives and content ) work together in harmony .
No one aspect can reign unchecked .
[ Paul Boag ]

[ Paul Boag ] Myth : absolute separation is possible .
I ’ll have to quote Jeff Croft on for this one …
” One of the hallmark attributes of web standards - based design is the concept that proper use of semantic ( X) HTML and CSS completely abstracts the presentation of a site from its content .
One key real - world benefit of this separation is that come redesign time , one only needs to change or replace the CSS stylesheet , and need n’t lay so much as a finger upon the hallowed grounds we call markup .
I ’m here to say that this mantra is n’t much more than a fairy tale .
” I ’ve thought this for awhile , but did n’t have the guts to say it publicly in fear of being flogged .
[ Jesse Bennett - Chamberlain ] [ Myth that ] absolute separation of structure , presentation and behavior is possible .
[ Shaun Inman ]

Myth : feature X is “ not possible . ”
As web developers we need to remember that just because it has n’t been done , does n’t mean it ’s not possible .
We ’ve got dozens of tools ( HTML , CSS , Flash ) at our tooltips — do n’t let anyone tell you that it ca n’t be done .
It just has n’t been done yet .

Myth : IE is an absolute nightmare to develop for .
I do n’t mean to ruffle too many feathers here ; but it ’s really not that bad .
Sure , it requires a little perseverance to get it there 100 % , but with a little compromise ( graceful degradation ;-) , you can have it looking pretty much ( 95 % ? ) the same as it does in other browsers .
For those things that are just impossible to do reasonable , compromise and do something slightly different for IE .

Myth : “ JavaScript is not a serious language . ”
It might not be the most elegant language but it ’s extremely powerful .
The fact that it can used by novices and gurus alike ( in obviously different capacities ) makes it very flexible .

It might not be the most elegant language but it ’s extremely powerful .
The fact that it can used by novices and gurus alike ( in obviously different capacities ) makes it very flexible .

Myth : development process is a wholly internal one , unaffected by outside circumstances .
The idea that the web design and development process is a wholly internal one , unaffected by outside circumstances .
The truth is , web professionals get their ideas from the same places that anybody else does : anything from the way their favorite coffee shop operates , to an impressive service offered by their home city .
Web professionals are more connected than we think .

1.7 . Developers ca n’t be designers , designers ca n’t be developers .
You ’re either a designer or a developer .
It might seem there is a clear divide between the two , however there are people out there who have no problem being both .
A great example is Shaun Inman .
CSS / XHTML is a great middle point , from there you can progressively go either way .

Web developers do n’t understand design , and vice versa .
It can be true , but it ’s not always the case .
You should consider that maybe a developer or a designer started off as something else .
And even if they have n’t , the good ones usually know at least a little bit about the other side of the fence , so do n’t count them out entirely .
[ Patrick Haney ]
One person should do one job .
I think that having individuals whose knowledge and skills span across different areas ( e.g. programming and design ) produces a much more balanced result .
That is n’t to say that one particular person does n’t have ownership over their particular area .
But when everyone can contribute to different areas of a project , you get a much more informed and coherent whole .

Do n’t get me wrong , I am always learning about SEO and reading those blogs , but my focus is primarily on coding an SEO - friendly site .
Past that , it ’s simply not what web developers do .
I personally consider them to be two very different worlds .

1.9 . Usability Myths
Users do n’t scroll further than the fold .
There was an interesting article written about this quite recently : Blasting Myth of the Fold .
Andy Peatling ]
Where do you start …
My favourites have always been : - “ content must be above the fold ” , - “ content must be accessible within three clicks ” , - “ external links must be pop-ups ” .
All of them are myths that have caused far more harm than good .
[ Russ Weakley ]

Underestimating the power of ideas .
[ Myth that ] “ Un- design ” sells .

[ Daniel Mall ]
[ Myth that ]
Bad ideas are useless .
Even after you arrive at a what feels like a good solution , you ’ve got to push yourself to keep thinking .
Every idea — no matter how dumb — is a potential breakthrough or could lead to a breakthrough .
You ’ve got to document those bad , random ideas .
Plus , you get to save them and revisit them for future inspiration .

2 . One bulletproof method to get over creativity block
How to get started ?
How to get things done till the deadline ?
What is a bulletproof method to get a new creativity spark ?
World leading designers not always know the answer , and many answers are quite obvious — however , not all of them .
2.1 . Change the perspective : go away .
Go someplace “ different ” from your usual haunts , away from places where you take every object , interaction or decoration for granted .
Ride your bike or take a walk through back alleys , unfamiliar neighborhoods or industrial areas .
Bring a few old magazines picked up at a flea market or yard sale ( maybe circa 1920s - 1960s ) and take a break to page through them .
Make notes .
Sketch .
I am always surprised how much inspiration I get from things completely unrelated to the problem I am trying to solve .
[ Bill Keaggy ]
Go for a walk outside .
My office sits a block from a river , and if I just ca n’t think of anything to do , taking a walk along the bank clears out my head every time .
[ Steve Smith ]
.

[ Steve Smith ]
Get out more .
There ’s beautiful design all around us that we take for granted every day ; we just need to open our eyes a little more when searching for inspiration .
[ Oliver Beattie ]
Spend time in nature .
Alternately , simply wandering around the city without any particular destination does wonders .
[ Adam Greenfield ]
Step away from the computer .
Go for a walk , head to the gym , or just sleep on the problem .
You ’ll come back refreshed and with a new outlook on the task at hand .
[ Andy Budd ]
In my case stepping away from the computer is often the answer .
Sometimes I believe that computers literally suck the creativity out of us .
I find going for a walk , flicking through a magazine or visiting a gallery far more stimulating than surfing the latest web design gallery .
I believe looking beyond web design for inspiration does more to aid innovation and creativity than anything else .
I do n’t believe there is one bulletproof method of overcoming creative block .
We are all different and our creativity is expressed and stimulated in different ways .
[ Paul Boag ]
Take a walk .
For me , getting away from the screen can be very refreshing .
Have you ever had a problem that you ca n’t fix , walked away from it , and then come back and fixed it straight away ?
Same principle .
Andy Peatling ]
Walk away from your computer and leave your PDA at home - sometimes all you need is a new perspective .
[ Larissa Meek ]
. [ Larissa Meek ]
Replace your current environment / surroundings with something new and fresh .
If that means changing your location , do it .
[ Dan Rubin ]
There are no bulletproof methods , but one that often works for me is going for a walk outside .
[ Jason Santa Maria ]
The 11th hour is surprisingly effective at inspiring some unique work .
Often though , the first thing I do is create a skeleton template and begin hacking at it for about half - an - hour .
If that does n’t work , I ’ll grab a coffee down the street .
[ Craig Saila ]
2.2 . Change the perspective : do sport .
Go for a long walk , better still , a run .
Having to focus on something else for a while will get the creative juices flowing again .
[ Mark Boulton ]
Sport as a displacement activity .
Go to the gym , go for a run , go for a swim , or in my case I go for a bike ride .
Half an hour ’s normally enough to empty the mind of panic and fill it with that spark you need .
[ Richard Rutter ]
Do n’t leave one screen to go sit in front of another and watch TV .
Go workout , take a run .
Or do some errands .
Just do something active for at least an hour that does not require you to think about work or look at your crackberry .
[ Nick Francis ]
for at least an hour that does not require you to think about work or look at your crackberry .
[ Nick Francis ]
What helps for me is to do some sport to clear my head or to leave the office and go out in nature to sit their for awhile .
Both things are n’t bullet proof .
[ Veerle Pieters ]
2.2 . Get inspired : read and look around .
Be a continuous feedback loop .
That means continuous input : reading books and blogs , attending talks and conferences , using the medium you design for .
It also means continuous output : writing books and blogs , speaking at conferences , designing .
[ Luke Wroblewski ]

Get up and leave your computer .
If you are looking for a good book on inspiration , I ’d recommend Curt Cloninger ’s “ Hot - Wiring Your Creative Process ” .
I hate the title and the cover , but the book ’s a gem .
[ Carolyn Wood , Editor in Chief of Digital Web Magazine ]
Look through galleries of design online , in books , or in real life .
[ Mike Davidson ]
I find that music , art , and design magazines are very inspiring , so that ’s where I always turn .
[ Jina Bolton ]
Research . .
Two places I like to look for inspiration : magazines and architecture .
Make a trip to the bookstore or to the library and just flip .
Look at how they present information and structure the design .
Then , integrate those elements into your own design .
[ Jonathan Snook ]

[ Jonathan Snook ]
Looking around websites , design books , magazines .
I have a wide range of website screenshots that I look through before starting design projects .
Some would call this “ stealing ” .
I prefer the term “ inspiration ” . :)
[ Russ Weakley ]
Collect inspirational design and go back and look through it .
There ’s a reason I started my Web Design Inspiration set on Flickr a while back , and it was n’t for fame or fortune ( I ’ve gotten a tiny bit of the former , but I assure you , none of the latter ) .
Sometimes , when I need some ideas , I ’ll just browse through all of those screenshots I ’ve taken , and something will just click .
When you look at inspirational design , it makes you want to go out and create something cool .
[ Patrick Haney ]
2.3 . Listen to music .
Pick up a guitar and strum a view chords ( at least this works for me ) .
You might instead want to take a short walk or have some diner but the point is : stop working .
Even just 5 minutes of doing something totally different gives the distance you need .
Coming back to my Mac it ’s often clearly visible what to do next . [ Markus Stefan ]
Listen to music .
Music is an equal blend of emotion and analysis .
If you let yourself be inspired by it , you ’ll often be astonished at the results .
[ Daniel Mall ]
2.4 . Observe the world .
Go lie down in the park and just stare at the world .
I find that once let my mind truly relax and forget about things like the bills , calling my Mom back , and the rest of it all — suddenly my creativity kicks into overdrive . [ Kyle Neath , Warpspire.com ]

Go somewhere that you can observe creativity in a different aspect than your day - to - day environment .
For instance , go to a museum or a attend a play .
Gain an appreciation for artfulness beyond the confines of your profession , and this will breathe new life into your work .
[ Nathan Smith ]
Take a deep breath , stand up from your computer , and go somewhere you ’ve never been before — a cafe , an exhibition … Prague .
[ Cameron Adams , Themaninblue.com ]
2.5 . Do something entirely different .
Drop what you ’re doing and find a happy place .
Whether it ’s listening to music , reading a book or playing a video game .
Whatever will get your mind off of work temporarily and give you time to yourself that you thoroughly enjoy .
When you sit back down in front of the screen , you should feel refreshed and ready to jump back in .
[ Matt Brett ]
Take a long shower and get yourself a cup of coffee … just do something completely different .
[ Wolfgang Bartelme ]
Do something else entirely .
Look at things that have nothing necessarily to do with web design .
Get inspiration off - screen .
I have a quarter - sized basketball hoop in my office , and if I ’m stuck on something , I ’ll shoot hoops and let my mind wander and quite often something useful will pop in there at some point .
[ Ryan Masuga ]

[ Ryan Masuga ]
Just do the complete opposite .
Do n’t fall into the trap of following current trends or gallery websites .
To maximise creativity and different thought patterns , find other sources that may inspire or invoke an idea .
Such sources could be simply taking a walk , photography or looking through different types of magazines .
[ Ian Main ]
2.6 . Seek for a new approach .
Sketch as you go .
Take some pencil and paper , go somewhere you feel comfortable , and brainstorm ideas .
Sketch as you go .
I usually come up with my best ideas when I am far away from a computer screen .

Start over .
If I ’m stuck on some element of a design , chances are that I ’ll agonize over the element for hours when it ’s really something else in the design that is n’t working .
Continuing to try to make it work at that point is like putting lipstick on a pig .
When I get to that point , it ’s best to just start over with a blank canvas .

Consider what would other designers do ?
Something that I ’ll do is think to myself , “ what would ___ ( insert favourite designer ’s name here ) ___ do in this situation ?
How would they handle the design of this nav ?
Would they use 2 or 3 columns for this layout ?
When I start asking those questions , ideas immediately start coming to mind and ideas start flowing .

My favourite one from that article : “ Lose the lorem - ipsum : Looking at a page template that has the same mundane text on it that you ’ve seen on a bajillion other page - templates over the years will lead you to think that your page will be no better than mundane , either .
When context is lacking , content is king . ” [ Phil Renaud ]
2.7 . Put creative work on hold .
Just get something down without worrying whether it ’s perfect or a great start .
Once you erase a blank canvas , it gets easier to move forward .
[ Meryl K. Evans ]
Put the task or project down and either take a break from work altogether or perform some tasks that require no creativity ( like bookkeeping or organization tasks ) and distract your conscious mind from the challenges .
Later return to the task , make a simple list of objectives and start working again to address the creative problem by creating elements that solve the respective problems ( divide and conquer ) .
[ Frederick Townes ]
2.8 . Communicate .
Go off the grid .
Talk to human beings .
In person .
Do something out of the ordinary , out of character .
Give your brain a chance to regroup and hit it with some fresh stimuli . [ Shaun Inman ]

Give your brain a chance to regroup and hit it with some fresh stimuli . [ Shaun Inman ]
Definitely getting up on one ’s feet , making a cup of tea , and gathering colleagues or the client team together and getting it all out into the open .
A creative block is nearly impossible to shift if one works in a vacuum , so throw sketches , wireframes , magazines and books onto a big table , and open a discussion about the aims and objectives .
The very , very last thing I think anyone should do is browse the web when struggling with web design or development inspiration .
Get away from the screen and find it elsewhere ![ Simon Collison ]
2.9 . Train your creativity .
Force yourself to do something creative every day .
It can be anything : writing , drawing , shooting photos , etc .
The idea is to get into the habit of being creative every day .
[ D. Keith Robinson ]
I ca n’t say what will work for others , but what works for me is lots of hard exercise .
The longer I try to get “ into ” a creative project , the more I dwell on detail and begin to miss the forest for the trees .
Technical design elements are not creativity and I like to step way out of the creative process into a very physical process in order to get back into creative thinking from the outermost extremity and with the right perspective .
[ Andy Rutledge ]

Hah !
You ’re asking the wrong person .

What I try to do when I get a creativity block of some kind is force myself to just get started .
That often helps .
[ Roger Johansson ]
.

[ Roger Johansson ]
In case of doubt , jump !
Hey , I do n’t say it ’s easy ( I near panic every time ) , but since we are problem solvers , there is a moment when we temporarily become the ‘ problem ’ because facing this new challenge .
Start working !
That ’s it !
And everything we did in preparation ( research , brief objectives ) will start to fall into place .. at some point .
But if you freeze and stare … good luck .
NOTHING , will be the end - result .
[ Carole Guevin , Netdiver.net ]
2.10 . Relax .
Do something relaxing .
“ Relaxing ” is different for everybody , but for me that creativity block is usually self - imposed because I ’m trying to hard .
My best ideas never come to me when I ’m looking for them .
They just kind of sneak up on me when I ’m doing something else .
[ Garrett Dimon ]
3 . One thing I wish I knew before I ’ve started programming / designing
Before starting to learn the basics of design and web - development , it ’s nice to have a basic idea of what you need to learn properly and what you should prepare of .
50 things you should know before starting programming / designing .
3.1 . Professional skills .
Grids .
Planning a design based on a grid helps create a structure that flows from page to page while keeping a set plan fixed when building upon or updating the design .
Khoi Vinh has a great presentation on how to set up grids step by step .

Working with frameworks .
Building sites on systems or frameworks .
I used to hand - make every website , until I found WordPress .
Then I moved to ExpressionEngine , which I now use for all my projects .
Developing on a system allows you to do so much more than you could just cobbling together 3rd - party scripts on your own .

Web standards .
I wish I ’d known about web standards and CSS when I started , partly because I could have written “ Designing With Web Standards ” instead of Zeldman , but mostly as it would have saved me considerable time from 1999 to 2002 when I was lost in table layouts and font tags , thinking there had to be a better way .
[ Simon Collison ]
I wish I had grasped the potential of web standards sooner .
I remember hearing about CSS back in 1998 but I simply did n’t get it .
I did n’t understand its power .
As it was I did n’t adopt standards properly until 2002 by which time I was running my own business .
Moving an entire company from table based design to CSS is a time consuming and expensive business and it definitely impacted our bottom line .
Of course I am glad that I made the transition because the sites I work with now are much easier to maintain and adapt .
Ultimately it has made us more profitable and competitive .
I just wish I had made the switch on somebody else ’s dime and not my own ! [ Paul Boag ]

What may be obvious to me , in the context of ideas floating in my brain , might not be readily evident to those I am speaking with .
As designers , we need to know how to communicate verbally as well as visually .
So much of the day - to - day activities revolve around making sure people understand one another , and that does n’t just take place on a computer monitor .

Ability to focus .
Focus , focus , focus .
Being aware of other technologies , techniques etc is advantageous and helps with problem solving skills ( among others ) , but focusing on building a primary skill set makes it easier to get results with that toolset and gives confidence to move on to develop more skills from there ; as opposed to studying every technique out there and really not spending as much time as possible defining ones skill set .
The learning process never ends , so best to start by polishing your strengths and then moving on .

Ability to say “ no ” .
I wish I knew how to say “ no ” to prospective clients .
In my first few years of business I was too afraid to offend anyone , and ended up taking on way too much work , to the point where my personal life and creativity suffered .

When I started out , I thought I was could design websites easily , and I took on some projects that were way out of my league .
If I had known my own abilities better , I would have saved myself a lot of embarrassment .

Be satisfied with your work .
You ’ll always look back and think you could have done something differently on a project .
I think this is simply down to the pace in which the web industry moves .
Tools and techniques are always changing .
As long as you did the best you could at that point in time , be happy .

Browser war would never stop .
When I started designing for the Web I programmed my first HTML - Dummy and it looked great .
When I was nearly done , someone showed me a software called Internet Explorer .
We opened it and everything I had done was messy .
We closed it , laughed and wondered on how someone would really use a „ browser “ like that .
Needless to say , that a few years later IE was market leader .
So if i knew that in my little world the browser wars would never stop - nowadays optimizing websites for IE 5.5 , 6 , 7 , Firefox , Safari , Opera , and so on - i’d probably be a carpenter today … ;-) [ Markus Stefan ]
The browser war and the mindset that lead to them will always be a problem .
Even though the first two wars were the result of Netscape followed by Microsoft , the stagnation and resulting fallout ( legacy incompatibility and proprietary additions to markup ) will always be present regardless of which company is responsible , be it Microsoft , Netscape , Mozilla , Apple or Opera .

3.4 . Having a mentor .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - President George W. Bush exceeded his authority when he directed Texas to comply with an international court ’s ruling and reopen dual - murder case against a Mexican on death row , the U.S. Supreme Court ruled on Tuesday .
By a 6 - 3 vote in a case that pitted Bush against his home state , the high court said Bush should not have ordered Texas to comply with the World Court ruling mandating the review of the cases of Jose Medellin and 50 other Mexicans in U.S. prisons awaiting execution .
Medellin was denied the right to meet with a consular official from Mexico after his arrest in Texas for the June 1993 rape and murder of two teen - aged girls .
The Hague court in 2004 ordered the United States to review his case , and those of the other Mexican death row inmates , on the grounds that his Vienna Convention right to talk to consular officers after his arrest had been violated .
Bush in 2005 decided to comply with the World Court ’s ruling and issued a memorandum to then - Attorney General Alberto Gonzales directing state courts to review the cases to determine whether the violation of their rights caused the defendants any harm at trial or sentencing .
Chief Justice John Roberts said in the majority opinion that Bush cannot require the states to provide review and reconsideration of the claims of the 51 Mexican nationals , in disregard of state court rules and law .
Medellin ’s attorneys appealed to the Supreme Court and said a Texas court ruling that Bush had overstepped his powers and put the United States in violation of its undisputed treaty obligations .
The Bush administration supported Medellin and said the president must have the authority to ensure that the United States adheres to such treaty obligations .
The Mexican government also has weighed in on behalf of Medellin , who has been on death row since 1994 .
Texas officials acknowledged Medellin was never told he could talk to Mexican officials .
But they argued that claim cannot be made now because he never properly raised it previously .
Even if his treaty rights had been violated , it would not have made any difference in the outcome , they said .
Roberts rejected the administration ’s argument that Bush has the authority to establish binding rules affecting court decisions that preempt contrary state law .
He said the memo -- a directive issued to state courts that would compel the reopening of final criminal judgments and set aside state laws -- is not supported by Bush ’s foreign affairs authority to resolve claims disputes .
Roberts , who was appointed by Bush , was joined by Justices Antonin Scalia , Anthony Kennedy , Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito , Bush ’s other appointee on the court .
Justice John Paul Stevens concurred in the judgment .
Justices Stephen Breyer , David Souter and Ruth Bader Ginsburg dissented .
CouchDB has been mentioned a few times on sitepoint.com ( here , here , and here ) but this year brought some exciting changes for the project .
Firstly , on New Years Day , Damien Katz announced that he had accepted a full - time position at IBM to primarily work on CouchDB .
The intention being that CouchDB would remain an open source project , donated to the Apache Software Foundation and licensed accordingly .
The second big development was that on February 12 CouchDB was accepted for incubation by the Apache Software Foundation .
So it looks like CouchDB is definitely going places .
On the development front Damien recently demonstrated some tantalizing map / reduce functions in JavaScript to generate some useful views from the database .
Anyone else intrigued by a database that primarily uses JavaScript , JSON , and plain old HTTP ?
More than 1,000 French riot police and special forces raided housing estates in a troubled Paris suburb at dawn yesterday , kicking open doors and arresting 33 people in a search for the suspected ringleaders of violent riots last year .
President Nicolas Sarkozy 's political opponents called the operation an excessive " security spectacle " after pictures of armoured police trucks and " RoboCop " riot police were broadcast by television reporters tipped off in advance .
Leftwingers accused Sarkozy , who is suffering in the polls , of trying to bolster his UMP party ahead of local elections next month .
The operation focused on 10 apartment blocks in Villiers - le - Bel and the surrounding area north of Paris , which saw three nights of serious rioting last November after two teenagers died in a motorbike crash with a police car .
Although the unrest was contained within a few days , it was more serious than weeks of rioting in 2005 because the Villiers - le - Bel rioters fired guns at the police .
During the unrest , 130 officers were injured , including at least 10 hit by buckshot or pellets .
Sarkozy vowed to track down the riot ringleaders " one by one " .
In December police leafleted the estates offering cash rewards for information .
This month , launching an aid package for France 's troubled high - rise blocks , where youth unemployment can reach 40 % , Sarkozy vowed a " war without mercy " on crime .
The labour minister , Xavier Bertrand , said the arrests of people aged 17 to 31 showed " there is no zone of lawlessness in our republic " .
But the socialist Ségolène Royal said launching the raids with cameras in tow during an election period served " to influence opinion , to scare " .
Sarkozy has sunk to his lowest ever poll ratings .
This weekend politicians , including the former conservative prime minister Dominique de Villepin and Royal , signed an appeal against the emergence of an " elective monarchy " in France .
They did not name Sarkozy , but delivered a thinly veiled attack against a monarchic form of " purely personal power " .
President Bush claimed on Thursday that U.S. forces and Iraqi tribesman have " systematically dismantled " the terrorist group Al Qaeda in Iraq in the long - troubled Anbar Province .
And indeed , while Al Qaeda in Iraq remains dangerous and active , particularly in parts of northern Iraq , the terrorist group is having increasing difficulty pulling off its signature type of attack , deadly car bombings .
But terrorism experts are warning that defeating Al Qaeda in Iraq could bring a whole new set of risks .
For one thing , as U.S. intelligence agencies have told Congress , its operatives could shift their efforts to plotting outside the country if it becomes significantly more dangerous for Al Qaeda in Iraq to stage attacks in Iraq .
" Defeating Al Qaeda in Iraq could actually lead to the spread of violence to other places because those guys could be leaving to find other safe havens to continue their fight , " says Mohammed Hafez , the author of Suicide Bombers in Iraq : The Strategy and Ideology of Martyrdom .
" They are likely to go to places where there are existing conflicts . "
The two most obvious destinations are Afghanistan or Pakistan , where they could potentially link up with other jihadists who have been carrying out a growing number of suicide attacks .
Fighters could be drawn to the relative lawlessness of Yemen , the total anarchy of Somalia , or to Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon .
Writing in the current issue of CTC Sentinel , the monthly journal of the Combating Terrorism Center at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point , Hafez analyzes the experiences of Arab jihadists who went to Afghanistan in the 1980s to the fight the Soviet Union and later formed the backbone of al Qaeda , the terrorist network headed by Osama bin Laden .
Thousands of Arab volunteers were trained to fight the Soviets , but when the conflict ended , many migrated to other conflict zones around the world to continue the fight .
They also had forged close ties with each other , helping them to put together a global jihadi network that allowed al Qaeda to spread its tentacles into Europe , Africa , and Asia .
Today 's jihadists in Iraq are getting even more hands - on combat experience than their predecessors in Afghanistan .
" What 's just as important as the fighting skills are the logistical skills — the back administration office work that needs to be done for terrorism to take place , " says Hafez .
He is talking about skills like raising money for operations , forging documents , and smuggling fighters across international borders .
It is unclear how much U.S. officials or Iraq 's neighbors have done to prepare for this threat .
Hafez says that border controls must be strengthened and that American and Iraqi officials need to share intelligence on these militants with all of Iraq 's neighbors to prevent them from escaping Iraq .
Of particular concern is Syria , through which the bulk of foreign fighters entered Iraq .
" But they wo n't be willing to host the jihadis in the way Pakistan did " in the 1990s , says Hafez .
" They will probably have to cross multiple borders , which increases their chances of being caught . "
One other key factor could also limit how many Al Qaeda in Iraq members end up fighting elsewhere in the future .
The bulk of these foreign fighters came to Iraq to be suicide bombers .
" That means , " says Hafez , " many wo n't be around . "
This discussion , of course , could be premature .
Al Qaeda in Iraq has not yet been defeated and could still regroup successfully .

SEATTLE ( Reuters ) - Microsoft Corp MSFT .O unveiled a new initiative on Monday that will give college and high school students around the world free access to technology tools used to develop and design software .
Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates speaks at a keynote address at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas , January 6 , 2008 .
Microsoft unveiled a new initiative on Monday that will give college and high school students around the world free access to technology tools used to develop and design software .
REUTERS / Rick Wilking
The world ’s largest software maker said the initiative will allow students to use Microsoft ’s developer and designer tools to write software applications , design elaborate Web pages or create new video games to run on the Xbox 360 console .
The development and design tools are available immediately to college students in the United States , Western Europe and China , but Microsoft said it will eventually extend the program to other countries and high school students , potentially reaching 1 billion students .
Chairman Bill Gates , who co-founded Microsoft with childhood friend Paul Allen , recalled how , as a teenager , he would sneak in at night to a company that sold shares of time on a big mainframe computer to read the manuals and learn more about developing software .
These were the days before the personal computer and getting computer access was difficult and expensive .
With that in mind , Gates wanted to give broad access to software tools that can be expensive and difficult to get for students .
“ I can relate very well to these student developers , ” Gates said in an interview with Reuters .
“ For students , any fee is a barrier . ”
Gates will unveil the “ DreamSpark ” initiative during a tour of U.S. and Canadian colleges starting on Tuesday with a speech at Stanford University .
Using a broadband connection , students can download Visual Studio , Microsoft 's main development tools used by professional developers , and Expression Studio , design software that rivals Adobe Systems Inc's ADBE .O Creative Suite offering .
Gates said many designers opt for Adobe ’s design software because they are more familiar with it and the company could benefit if students become more comfortable working with Microsoft ’s design tools .
Microsoft said it will also make available XNA Game Studio software development tools for writing video games and a free one - year membership to the “ XNA Creators Club ” so they can bring those games to the Xbox 360 platform .
“ For the individual developer ... getting their hands on these tools has n’t been that simple , ” Gates said .
In the past , Microsoft has made development and design software available to students , but it was up to the universities to register for the program .
As a result , most of the students who took advantage of the program tended to be computer science students at major universities .
Gates said he hopes this latest initiative will deepen the pool of potential developers as well as the fields of study where software can lead to breakthroughs .

At least someone knows how to fill a piggy bank .
Unlike most American consumers , whose failure to save has exasperated economists for years , the typical American corporation has increased its savings so sharply that it probably has enough cash on hand to completely pay off its debts .
That should be good news in an economy unsettled by rising energy prices , tightening credit , gyrating stock prices and declining values for the dollar and the family homestead .
Indeed , the Federal Reserve chairman , Ben S. Bernanke , cited strong corporate balance sheets as a bright spot in the darkening forecast he presented to Congress last week .
Some analysts also speculate that these cash - rich companies may start sharing their wealth with investors through special dividends , providing welcome stimulus for the economy .
Corporate spending on equipment and other capital expenditures has declined as savings have soared , suggesting that companies could stimulate the economy now by going on a hiring and spending spree .
But that raises worries among some analysts that companies will spend their cash unwisely , making them more vulnerable in the future .

The Beginner 's Guide To Diet , Nutrition & Healthy Eating
So it seems you want to improve your diet .
Fantastic idea .
Do you know what can be done with a healthy diet ?
You can lose weight , gain weight or just maintain your weight as is .
You can lower your cholesterol or your blood pressure or perhaps just keep those numbers in a healthy range .
You can improve your immune system , your energy level , your athletic performance , your skin , your teeth , your bones and a whole lot more .
You can greatly lower your risk of heart disease , diabetes and a variety of other health issues .
You can help control , prevent , aid , or improve nearly every aspect of your health and your body .
Of course , you probably know this already .
What you may not know is where to go from there .
I mean , this all sounds great and everything , but uh , what do you do now ?
The decision to improve your overall diet and nutrition leads a lot of people to a lot of questions .
For example :
What should I eat ?
What should n't I eat ?
How much should I eat ?
Which nutrients should I eat ?
What does each nutrient do ?
What foods contain these nutrients ?
How much of each am I supposed to consume each day ?
Is this guy ever going to stop with the example questions ?
If you 've ever asked any of those questions or think you may ask them in the future , you 're in luck .
Below I have compiled all of the answers in one convenient location .
It 's what I like to call The Beginner 's Guide To Diet , Nutrition & Healthy Eating .
I have broken it all down into 2 fairly simple parts ; the learning and the doing .
First up , the learning ...
Part 1 : The Basics Of Nutrition
Below you will find a chart containing the most important parts of every person 's diet .
Along with each will be a short description explaining what it is , what its role is in the human body , the recommendations for how much of it you should consume per day , and the most common foods that contain a significant amount of it .
For the most part , this is pretty much all there is to the basics of nutrition .
Check it out ...
Description Recommended Amount Per Day Sources Calories
A calorie is the unit of measurement for how much energy there is in a food or drink .
We consume calories in the form of carbohydrates , protein and fat ( and alcohol ) which all contain a certain number of calories per gram ( see right column ) .
The calories are used by the body to do literally everything it needs to do ( pump blood , walk , etc. ) .
This is why very low calorie diets are dangerous and should be avoided .
Calories also play the largest role in weight control .
If you consume more calories than your body needs to use for energy , the left over calories will be stored on the body mostly in the form of fat ( thus causing weight gain ) .
If you consume less calories than your body needs to use , it does the opposite and uses stored body fat for energy instead ( thus causing weight loss ) .
If you consume the same number of calories that your body uses , everything evens out ( thus causing weight maintenance ) .
The number of calories you should consume per day is based on way too many factors for there to just be a general guideline for everyone .
Your height / weight , your gender , your metabolism , your activity level and your goals ( weight loss , weight gain , weight maintenance ) all play a role .
For this reason , your daily calorie intake has to be tailored specifically to you and your body .
It 's alright though , relax .
Everything you need in order to figure how many calories you should consume per day can be found in the Guide To Calories & Weight Control .
Carbs : 4 calories per gram
Protein : 4 calories per gram
Fat : 9 calories per gram
Alcohol : 7 calories per gram Fat Despite all of the crazy things you may have heard , fat is required by our bodies to function properly .
For starters , certain vitamins can not be absorbed by the body without fat .
It also plays an important role in healthy hair , skin and cell function and is the source of essential fatty acids , another extremely important part of our diet .
I will also mention that the idea that " eating fat makes you fat " is a myth .
As mentioned above , weight gain / loss is controlled by calories .
If you supply your body with too many calories , you will gain fat .
It wo n't matter what nutrient those calories came from ( fat , protein or carbs ) , too much of anything will cause weight gain .
Of course , not all fat is equal .
Certain types ( polyunsaturated and monounsaturated ) should comprise the majority of your fat intake ( sources of these " healthy " fats are listed in the right column ) .
These " good " fats have been shown to lower blood cholesterol levels and the risk of heart disease .
One specific polyunsaturated fat , the omega - 3 fatty acid ( found in fish , fish oil and walnuts ) , may be the most beneficial of all .
On the other hand , there are certain types of fat that do the complete opposite ( cause rather than prevent ) and should be limited or even avoided completely .
More on them below .
The USDA recommends that a maximum of 30 % of your total daily calorie intake comes from fat .
Most other sources / experts recommend something in a similar range , typically somewhere between 20 - 30 percent .
So , if an example person eats 2000 calories per day , 20 - 30 percent of that would be 400 - 600 calories .
And , since 1 gram of fat contains 9 calories , this works out to be about 44 - 66 grams of fat per day for this example person .
Almonds , walnuts , peanuts , other nuts and seeds , salmon , sardines , mackerel , other fish and fish oil , olive oil , canola oil , avocados .
Saturated Fat
This is one of the so - called " bad " fats .
Despite there being some debate as to exactly what degree saturated fats negatively affect us ( it seems less evil than it was originally made out to be ) , it still appears as though saturated fat should be limited to SOME extent in most people 's diets .
The USDA recommends limiting your saturated fat intake to a maximum of 10 % of your total calorie intake , or a maximum of 1/3 of your total fat intake ( which is basically the same thing if you follow the above recommendation for total fat ) .
The American Heart Association 's saturated fat recommendations are a bit lower , suggesting a maximum of 7 % of your total calorie intake .
Animal and poultry fat .
Milk , cheese , butter and other dairy products .
Most typical junk food ( candy bars , chips and similar snack foods , pastries , cookies , desserts , etc. ) and fast food items .
Trans Fat Trans fat is bad .
In fact , it just may be as bad as it gets .
Trans fat has been shown to raise your bad ( LDL ) cholesterol levels and lower your good ( HDL ) cholesterol levels .
A diet containing a significant amount of trans fat increases your risk of heart disease , stroke , type 2 diabetes and possibly even more .
Long story short , avoid it .
I will also mention that there are two different ways you could consume trans fat .
One is in the small amounts found naturally in certain meat and dairy products .
The second and much more common way is in the man -made form that is found in a variety of other foods .
The reason for its usage in these foods is that it is cheap to use , has a longer shelf life , and tastes good .
Food companies have no problem focusing on those 3 reasons and ignoring the fact that it 's probably the worst thing you could possibly eat .
The American Heart Association recommends a maximum of 2 grams of trans fat per day .
The keyword there is maximum .
There is a ton of research proving that this stuff is borderline poison , which is why you really want to shoot for an even 0 grams .
Out of all the stuff in your diet that should be kept on the low side ( saturated fat , sodium , cholesterol ) , trans fat appears to be the only one that should be eliminated completely .
Something else to keep in mind when avoiding trans fat is that due to some idiotic labeling rules , food companies only need to list trans fat content if the food contains 0.5 grams or more per serving .
So , if a food contains 0.4999 grams of trans fat in one serving , it will say " Trans Fat : 0 grams " on the label .
Stupid ?
Very .
On the bright side , you can spot the foods that do this ( and there are MANY of them ) .
Check the ingredients for the words " hydrogenated " or " partially hydrogenated " ( usually followed by an oil of some sort ) .
If it shows up , then you know that food contains some amount of trans fat no matter what the label says .
Most fast food and common junk food items contain the largest amounts of trans fat .
However , small amounts can still be found in foods ranging from breakfast cereals to certain brands of whole wheat bread to everything in between .
Be sure to check the ingredients ( as mentioned in the middle column ) to know for sure if your food legitimately contains any .
Cholesterol Cholesterol is n't entirely a bad thing .
It 's actually required by the body to build and maintain cell membranes and is used for many other important functions as well .
There are two ways that we get cholesterol .
One is by the body itself , which the liver actually produces .
The other way is through our diet .
The amount produced by the body is usually all that we require , which means the amount we get through our diet should be kept within a certain limit ( more on that in the middle column ) .
As you probably already know , high blood cholesterol levels , which are a major risk factor for heart disease , would be a very bad thing .
This is another important reason why we try to keep our dietary cholesterol intake to a safe level .
I will also mention that dietary cholesterol is only one small part of the cause of high blood cholesterol .
Trans fat and saturated fat intake play an even larger role .
Your weight ( another reason calorie intake is important ) , age , activity level , and genetics also play a role .
The American Heart Association recommends that we consume less than 300 milligrams of cholesterol per day .
They also recommend shooting for less than 200 mg if you have any heart related issues , although you should of course check that with your doctor .
For the average healthy adult however , less than 300 mg of cholesterol per day is about the amount I 've seen most often recommended .
Egg yolks , dairy products , meat , chicken , turkey and fish .
Sodium Sodium is another nutrient that 's viewed as " bad " even though a certain amount is actually required by the body to help maintain proper fluid balance , help with the function of nerves and muscles , and more .
It 's when sodium intake is too high that the negative effects ( most notably high blood pressure ) occur .
This makes sodium another nutrient that should be limited in our diet .
The USDA , AHA and many other sources all recommend keeping your sodium intake under 2300 milligrams per day .
The AHA also recommends that African Americans , middle - aged and older adults , and those with high blood pressure should try to consume less than 1,500 mg of sodium per day .
Salted snack foods ( pretzels , chips , etc. ) , many fast food items , many canned foods , ham , bacon , corned beef , hot dogs and other similar meats , certain frozen foods , and certain dressings .
And of course , any food you add salt to .
Carbohydrates Carbohydrates ( AKA carbs ) are a major source of energy for the body .
The older , simpler explanation of carbs goes something like this .
There are two different types ; simple and complex .
Of the two , simple carbs should be avoided due to the speed at which they are digested .
Simple carbs digest quickly , and this has a negative effect on our blood insulin levels .
Diets high in simple carbs have been shown to increase our risk of diabetes and heart disease , while complex carbs have been shown to do the opposite .
For this reason , you should try to greatly limit typical junk foods like candy and dessert items , soda , and really any other sugary foods .
Complex carbs on the other hand digest slower and should therefore comprise the majority of your carb intake .
( See right column for examples of these foods . )
But , the " complex " and " simple " label only tells part of the story , which brings us to the usefulness of the glycemic index .
The glycemic index classifies carbs based on how quickly and how high they boost blood sugar when compared to pure glucose ( sugar ) .
This is useful for figuring out that a food like white bread , which actually fits the " complex carb " label , will in reality cause a rapid spike in our blood sugar levels .
For this reason , in addition to the simple carbs mentioned above , you should also greatly limit other high glycemic foods such as white bread , white rice , crackers , many cereals and other highly processed foods .
The amount of carbohydrates most often recommended per day is typically in the area of 50 % of your total calorie intake ( most recommendations range from 40 - 60 percent ) .
1 gram of carbs contains 4 calories .
So , let 's say an example person is consuming 2000 calories per day .
50 % of 2000 is 1000 calories .
And , since 1 gram of carbs contains 4 calories , you 'd divide 1000 by 4 and get 250 grams of carbs per day for this example person .
Fruits and vegetables , beans , oatmeal , brown rice , and other whole wheat / whole grain foods Fiber Fiber plays a key role in the health of the digestive system .
There are two types , soluble and insoluble .
Soluble fiber has been associated with reducing LDL cholesterol and an overall decreased risk of cardiovascular disease .
Insoluble fiber is also associated with decreasing cardiovascular risk as well as slowing the progression of cardiovascular disease in those who may already have it to some degree .
In addition , foods high in fiber ( see the right column for examples ) are typically also low in saturated and trans fat and high in a variety of important nutrients .
The USDA recommends that we consume 14 grams of fiber for every 1000 calories we consume .
So , if your daily total calorie intake was 2000 calories , your recommended fiber intake would be 28 grams per day ( a 3000 calorie diet would be 42 grams , etc. ) .
Most other fiber recommendations fall in the range of 25 - 35 grams per day for most people , which is pretty similar to the first recommendation assuming a fairly average calorie intake is present .
Fruits and vegetables , oatmeal , beans , bran and most whole grain / whole wheat products .
Protein Protein plays an important role in muscle , cell and organ function and is necessary for building and repairing the body 's tissues .
It is present in muscle , hair , skin , bone , and nearly every other body part , which makes protein a very important part of a healthy diet .
Pretty much every resource I 've come across recommends that we consume a minimum of 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight .
To figure this out in pounds , just divide your weight by 2.2 and then multiply your answer by 0.8 .
( For example , a 200 lb person would divide 200 by 2.2 and get about 91 .
They 'd then multiply 91 by 0.8 and get about 73 .
So , this example 200 lb person would require a minimum of 73 grams of protein per day . )
Of course , the keyword there is minimum , as 0.8g of protein for every kg of body weight is what 's required to keep the body from breaking down its own tissues .
The USDA recommends that about 15 - 20 percent of your total calorie intake comes from protein .
( This fits with their recommendations of about 50 % carbs and 30 % fat , which leaves 20 % for protein . ) 1 gram of protein contains 4 calories .
So , let 's say an example person is consuming 2000 calories per day .
15 - 20 percent of 2000 is 300-400 calories .
And , since 1 gram of protein contains 4 calories , you 'd divide 300 - 400 by 4 and get 75 - 100 grams of protein per day for this example person .
I will also mention that for those who do some form of intense exercise on a regular basis , there is some research showing the need for a higher protein intake .
A recommendation I 've seen for these individuals is 1.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight per day .
Many other resources recommend as much as 1 - 1.5 grams of protein per pound of body weight for those doing intense weight training regularly .
However , for the average healthy adult who wo n't be doing any form of intense exercise regularly , I like the the USDA 's 15 - 20 % of your total calorie intake recommendation , or perhaps my own " average person " recommendation of 0.5 grams of protein per pound of body weight ( a 200 lb person would do 200 x 0.5 = 100g of protein per day ) .
Anywhere in the range of these two suggestions would be pretty good .
Chicken , turkey , meat ( the leaner the better ) , fish , eggs , egg whites and , to a somewhat lesser extent , nuts and beans .
* All recommendations given are based on the average healthy adult .
Part 2 : Putting It All Together
Now that you 've learned the basics of nutrition , it 's time to put it all together and make a healthy diet out of it .
In the most general terms , it 's really pretty simple .
Basically , once you 've figured out what your total daily calorie intake should be , it 's just a matter of making sure these calories come from good sources that provide the things your body needs and limits the things that it does n't .
Let 's break that down step - by - step :
Calories
This is the starting point of diet creation , figuring out the number of calories you should be consuming each day in order for your weight to do what you want it to do .
Your choices here are weight loss , weight gain or weight maintenance .
As you learned earlier , in order to lose weight , you must consume less calories than your body needs .
In order to gain weight , you must consume more calories than your body needs .
And , if you just want to keep your weight right where it is , you need to consume the same number of calories that your body needs .
For a much better explanation of this and to figure out how many calories your body needs ( and therefore how many you need to eat per day ) check out my Guide To Calories & Weight Control .
It will explain everything .
When you 're done , come back here and move on to # 2 .
Fat , Carbs and Protein
Now that you 've figured out what your total daily calorie intake should be , it 's time to figure out where those calories are going to come from .
As you learned above , fat , carbs and protein will supply these calories .
Now it 's just a matter of eating the right amount of each .
So , just go back up and remind yourself of those recommendations .
And no , it does n't have to be exact .
Anywhere within range of those recommendations is perfectly fine .
Food Selection
Alright , so you got your calorie intake nailed down , and now you know how much of each nutrient ( fat , carbs and protein ) will supply those calories .
Now you just need to select the foods that will supply these nutrients while at the same time ensuring that you avoid and / or limit the things you should not be eating .
To do this , just go back through the food sources recommended for fat , carbs and protein , and pick your favorites .
Simple enough .
Organization
Once you have all of the quantities figured out and have made sure the quality is what it should be , all that 's left to do is organize it .
This could mean coming up with a rough idea of what your daily diet should be and then just improvising , or it could mean writing up a complete daily or weekly meal plan with everything planned and figured out in advance .
I can't tell you which you you should do , but I can tell you that the more planning you do , the easier it will be to not end up in a situation where you 're eating something you should n't , or just eating more / less than you should .
I will also mention that the times you eat ( early or late ) and the amount of meals you eat ( 3 meals or 6 meals ) does n't matter at all .
As long as you 're eating the right total amount of calories , protein , fat and carbs per day and getting those nutrients from mostly higher quality sources , you should organize it all in whatever way makes you most likely to consistently stick to it .
The specifics are insignificant , so do whatever is most enjoyable and convenient for you .
Consistency A healthy diet is useless if you are n't consistent with it .
Remember , this is n't a temporary thing .
Unless you only want the results to be temporary and the benefits to be nearly nonexistent , this has to become your new permanent way of eating .
So , be as consistent as you can and make a healthy diet a regular part of your life .
An Example Of A Healthy Diet
Just in case any of the above confused you at all , relax .
Towards the end of The Ultimate Weight Loss Guide , I put together a complete example diet for an example person by going through each of the above steps one - by - one to show exactly how to do it for yourself .
While that specific diet is tailored for weight loss , it could just as easily be for weight gain or weight maintenance if the total calorie intake was adjusted accordingly .
Everything else however ( the fat , carb and protein intake , the food choices , the setup and layout of the meals , etc. ) would still be figured out the exact same way .
So , to see an example of how it 's done , feel free to check out the example weight loss diet .

Beginner 's Guide FAQ
Just in case you were left with any questions after reading this , here 's my attempt at guessing what they might be and answering them for you .
How do I figure out how many calories are in my food ?
Or how much fat , carbs , protein , sodium , cholesterol , trans fat , saturated fat , fiber and everything else ?
The first obvious answer is to check the " nutrition facts " label on your food 's package .
The second slightly less obvious answer is to use this very site to look up this information .
All you need to do is search for a food and see it 's full nutritional content instantly ( and for free , by the way ) .
Sound good ?
Cool .
So , go search a Calorie Counter .
What about drinks ?
I now know what to eat , but what should I drink ?
Water , water and more water .
With the exception of something like green tea , there is no other drink I can really recommend .
Water is what your body needs and it does n't come with anything your body does n't need .
It 's perfect .
Soda , as you know , is pure garbage and should be eliminated completely .
And fruit juices and sports drinks are n't that different .
If you want the healthy things that are in fruit juices , eat the actual fruit .
Limiting alcohol would also be a good idea .
But really , for the most part , your drink of choice should be water .
What about vitamins and minerals and all that stuff ?
Did you leave this out because it 's not important ?
Nope , it definitely is important , but I left that stuff out for two reasons .
First , by following all of the above guidelines you will end up consuming all sorts of important vitamins and minerals by default .
That 's just how a healthy diet works out by design .
Second , I called this a " beginner 's " guide for a reason .
It 's meant to be an easy to understand crash course in diet , nutrition and healthy eating .
Basically , it 's here to take someone from " I want to lose weight " or " I want to eat better " or " I want to improve my diet and health " to " Alright , now I know what I need to do " and " Now I know how to set up a diet . "
Everything beyond the basics belongs in its own separate article .
I was just wondering ... what does your diet look like ?
For anyone interested , here 's a meal - by - meal break down of my diet .
While it definitely meets all of the above recommendations , there are a few other adjustments tailored specifically to my needs / goals , most of which would n't be too important for the average person just looking to become healthier and / or improve their weight .
Just figured I 'd mention that .
Have you written anything else that would be useful to someone looking to improve their diet and overall health ?
You bet I have .
I 'd recommend checking out my 8 Steps To A Healthy Diet and the previously mentioned Ultimate Weight Loss Guide .
Even if losing weight is n't your specific goal , there is still a ton of useful information in that guide .
Speaking of weight , the also already mentioned Guide To Calories & Weight Control would be a good idea to read as well .
After that , you can learn more about Reading Food Labels and Diet Myths .
Of course , you could just as easily look through all of the articles on this site as well as the a Calorie Counter Blog .
Getting Git , part 3 #
hacking , February 3rd 2008
Note : updated to correct a logical error .
When development converges , a child will have multiple parents — not vice - versa .
Kudos to Johannes Grødem for sharp eyes and a heads - up .
Intermission
I 've learned that some people are reading this and wondering if they really need to know all this to use Git ?.
No .
If all you 're using Git for is " edit - diff - commit , edit - diff - commit " cycle , you do n't .
This seems to be 99 % of what many people use a VCS for , and there is nothing wrong with that .
You can even go quite a bit beyond that , and still you do n't need to know anything about what 's really going on — just follow the a simple recipe , and you 're good to go .
It 's when you move beyond the recipe level that you need to understand the model the VCS uses , just like you need to with CVS , Subversion , Darcs , or any other VCS .
If you do n't think that 's true , you 've either internalized the model without noticing , or you 're just hammering out recipes .
Specifically , this series is written to teach enough of the Git model to be able to look at a bunch of disparate branches you need to merge somehow , figure out the kind of history you want to build , and then do that .
No recipe in the world is going to to this for the general case : you need to know what is going on before you can decide what you want .
What 's In A Commit
So , where were we ?
Ah , storing history .
If you have n't read it yet , here 's where you can read the story so far .
Commits are the third kind of object stored in the object database .
You could call commit " a moment in history " , but let 's see exactly what it contains :
Tree : the entire contents of the directory tree associated with the commit .
Parent (s ) : a commit has one or more parent commits .
A parent commit is the " previous " commit : the changes introduced by a commit can be seen by comparing the trees of the commit and its parent ( s ) .
The common case is a single parent : this represents normal linear development .
Multiple parents represent converging lines of development .
A commit with multiple parents is called a merge commit .
Two parents is the norm , but multiple branches can be merged with a single commit .
Comment : some text describing the commit .
Committer : the person who actually created the commit , and the date this was done .
Author : the person responsible for the change represented by the commit , and the date .
Often the author and the committer are the same , but when eg. submitting patches by email Git automatically preserves information about the original author .
Commits form a DAG via parents .
When development diverges , multiple children will share that same parent .
When development converges , a single child will have multiple parents .
If this is not clear , get a piece of paper , and draw a few dags — it 's more effective then any fancy graphic I might cook up .
So , if you have hold of a commit object , you have hold of the entire history up to that point — but you do n't know anything about the future .
In other words :
Back to our regularly scheduled Erlang envy .
Review :
What is a commit object ?
Can multiple commits refer to a single tree ; if so , what does it mean ; if not , why not ?
Can multiple commits share parents ; if so , what does it mean ; if not , why not ?
If the tip of a branch is a commit , can you guess what the history of the branch is ?
Next time : tagsoup .
Also , here 's some moral support for me :
Git is the next Unix says apenwarr .
I may not agree with the metaphor , but it 's a nice read :
Git was originally not a version control system ; it was designed to be the infrastructure so that someone else could build one on top .
And they did ; nowadays there are more than 100 git-* commands installed along with git .
It 's scary and confusing and weird , but what that means is git is a platform .
It 's a new set of nouns and verbs that we never had before .
Having new nouns and verbs means we can invent entirely new things that we previously could n't do .

It 's rather like being told donkeys still eat strawberries or that bears continue to regard the woods as a toilet , but a survey has suggested that Britons like buying drinks in rounds .
The survey of 7,500 people across 15 European countries has found that in Britain - as well as Sweden - 82 % of respondents are happy to buy a round of beer .
Czechs are believed to drink more beer than Britons
Enlarge Image
For many people the only socially acceptable way to do things is to get a round in .
Fergus Linnane , author of Drinking for England which is published next month , says the buying of rounds plays a part in rituals of bonding and social cohesion .
No - one knows when the practice became popular , but Linnane suggests the idea of keeping up with a certain level of drinking goes back at least to the arrival of the Vikings .
" The Scandinavians brought in the idea of drinking to oblivion .
The Vikings seemed to spend their lives drinking or fighting ... the idea of heroic drinking . "
Early concerns
And keeping up with the pace of drinking in the group , rather than the social element , has led some to frown on the round .
The Oxford English Dictionary 's first reference the concept is from 1633 and offers a colourful reminder of the dangers :
" Drink not the third glasse ...
It is most just to throw that on the ground , which would throw me there , if I keep the round . "
The authorities cottoned onto this in World War I , says Iain Loe , information and research manager at the Campaign for Real Ale .
They made the pubs really austere and you could n't treat people to a round
Iain Loe , Camra
" They made the pubs really austere and you could n't treat people to a round , " Mr Loe says .
But the concerns of the authorities have not dented a practice which makes its own little contribution to our supposed binge drinking .
Who has not had the feeling that having bought a round for a group of five , you should really drink five pints to get your money 's worth ?
The answer could be to return to the tokens available in pubs in the 17th and 18th Century , says Mr Loe .
Then you could keep the token and use it next time .
Away from the round , beer drinking etiquette differs in other countries .
In the UK , according to the survey for brewing giant SABMiller , only 28 % of people think it is acceptable to have a beer in a business meeting .
In laidback Sweden it 's 47 % .
It 's easy to imagine the Viking spirit lives on .
Below is a selection of your comments :
British culture is such that a person drinking in a group has no problem marching to the bar and ordering £ 20 of drinks .
This is because there is no lower life form below that of the round shirker who is always clocked and noted .
Curiously enough have you noticed that the same group of drinkers will carefully count the pennies to ensure fair play whenever someone orders an add on such as a packet of crisps .
Invariably this is paid for by the individual .
It 's just the way it is .
Peter Glover , Stockport
One of the things not mentioned is how you pay .
Most Europeans do n't buy each drink over the counter , you order as you go and pay at the end .
It 's up to a group to decide how they split the total .
Andy , Leeds
Rounds are also a way of saying how you trust your friends , if the rounds do n't add up then it is not a problem because they can just get the first round next time .
Also it can be used as wealth evener between friends without seaming to be a charity , my dad will often get a round in when we go for a drink with my friends and would never expect one back because he knows we could n't really afford it .
Daniel Philips , Brighton
This kind of " tradition " just serves to alienate the non-drinkers amongst social circles and friends .

The National Intelligence Estimate ( NIE ) report , which was declassified on Monday , disclosed for the first time that Iran had not been pursuing a nuclear weapons development programme for the past four years .
" This is a declaration of victory for the Iranian nation against the world powers over the nuclear issue , " said a jubilant Ahmadinejad said during a visit to Ilam province in western Iran .
He addressed thousands of people who greeted the remarks with celebratory whistles .
" This was a final shot to those who , in the past several years , spread a sense of threat and concern in the world through lies of nuclear weapons .
Thanks to your resistance , a fatal shot was fired at the dreams of ill - wishers and the truthfulness of the Iranian nation was once again proved by the ill - wishers themselves . "
The International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) , the UN nuclear watchdog , gave a more nuanced response to the NIE .
Mohamed ElBaradei , the IAEA director general , who has had prickly relations with the Bush administration , called the US intelligence report a " sigh of relief " because its conclusions gelled with his agency 's own findings .
While not going so far as to give Iran a clean bill of health , ElBaradei told reporters in Brasilia , Brazil , that Iran had been " somewhat vindicated in saying they have not been working on a weapons programme , at least for the past few years " .
The Chinese foreign minister , whose country has reluctantly supported previous UN sanctions against Iran , today ducked questions as to whether Beijing would support further measures .
Yang Jiechi told the Chatham House thinktank in London that Iran had the right to pursue peaceful nuclear energy , but said it should abide by relevant UN resolutions calling on its stop uranium enrichment .
" China hopes all parties will work together to peacefully resolve this issue , " Yang said .
Yesterday , the Iranian leadership called for plans for new United Nations sanctions against the country to be dropped in the face of the report .
Existing sanctions had been rendered " illegal " and the report showed the Bush administration 's warnings about Iran 's intentions were " baseless and unreliable " , said Iran 's foreign ministry spokesman , Mohammad Ali Hosseini .
The report 's conclusions have forced America 's European allies , as well as fellow UN security council members , to re-evaluate policy towards Iran .
The report will make it harder for the US , Britain and France to persuade China and Russia to impose tougher UN security council sanctions , despite George Bush 's assertion at a press conference yesterday that Iran remained dangerous .
China 's ambassador to the UN , Guangya Wang , was asked by reporters whether the report made the prospect of new UN sanctions less likely .
He said : " I think the council members will have to consider that , because I think we all start from the presumption that now things have changed . "
While the chances of a US military strike on Iran 's nuclear facilities are receding , the Israeli government continues to insist Tehran poses a serious danger and that the US is misreading the intelligence .
Against a background of triumphalism in Tehran , Hosseini said the findings destroyed the legal basis for last year 's decision to refer Iran 's case to the security council .
The council has passed two sets of sanctions and is debating a resolution that would impose a fresh embargo .
However , Iranian officials claimed that this was now unlikely .
The report was greeted as a vindication by supporters of Iran 's radical president , who has fought a bruising battle for control over nuclear policy with pragmatists who have accused him of pushing Iran towards a military confrontation with the US .
Ahmadinejad 's spokesman , Gholamhossein Elham , said : " Americans should pay the price for their words . "
Iran has said throughout the crisis that it has embarked on uranium enrichment for purely civilian purposes , to help meet its electricity and other energy needs .
But the US and Britain continue to suspect it is a step towards building a nuclear weapon .
US and European diplomats said yesterday that the new intelligence estimate would not derail the movement towards a new set of sanctions .
A senior Russian official agreed , adding that the new measures could be implemented in the next few weeks .
The British foreign secretary , David Miliband , said suspicions of Iran 's intentions would continue as long as it persisted in enriching uranium in the absence of any nuclear power stations in which the fuel could be used .
" That 's why people have fears about what the enrichment is for .
That 's why they have fears about the dangers of weaponisation , " the foreign secretary said .
At a meeting in Paris on Saturday , senior officials from the five permanent members of the security council and Germany - the six - strong contact group - agreed in principle on a new set of UN sanctions .
Participants said Russia and China , which had been reluctant to tighten sanctions , had given a green light to a limited range of targeted measures .
The details are being discussed in phone calls between representatives of the six countries this week .
Moscow and Beijing appeared to have softened their resistance after an IAEA report last month found that Iran had rapidly expanded its uranium enrichment .
What they said : Intelligence reports
2005 Assess with high confidence that Iran currently is determined to develop nuclear weapons despite its international obligations and international pressure , but we do not assess that Iran is immovable .
2007 Judge with high confidence that in fall 2003 Tehran halted its nuclear weapons programme .
Judge with high confidence that the halt lasted at least several years .
Department of Energy and National Intelligence Council have moderate confidence that the halt to those activities represents a halt to Iran 's entire nuclear weapons programme .
Assess with moderate confidence Tehran had not restarted its nuclear weapons programme as of mid-2007 , but we do not know whether it currently intends to develop nuclear weapons .
Judge with high confidence that the halt was directed primarily in response to increasing international scrutiny and pressure resulting from exposure of Iran 's previously undeclared nuclear work .
TV Newser :
Insiders tell TVNewser Tucker Carlson 's 6 pmET show Tucker is getting the axe , but Carlson stays on as a political contributor to all MSNBC shows at least through the 2008 election .
The official announcement , expected tomorrow , will include details about who will replace Tucker at 6 pmET as well as other political programming additions .
Sources say the network is going to beef up its schedule with more NBC News talent .
In recent days , Jossip , as well as other blogs , ratcheted up the talk that Tucker would be replaced " for a new project . "
In its 33 - month run , Carlson 's show has had two names , four time slots and multiple formats .
At 6 pmET , it builds on its Harbdall lead - in on some days , but loses audience on others .
Carlson is expected to host the show through next week , with his new role and title to take effect March 17 .
We 're told he 'll also be reporting from the campaign trail .

Lyrics graph
Idea by Kunal Anand , redone by leonardo maffi
Version 1.0 , November 29 2006
[ Go back to the index ]
Python code + some dot files : lyrics_graph.zip
Taking the idea from this page by Kunal Anand , I have created a small Python script to do something similar , and I have applied it on mostly Italian songs .
The program is very simple , it uses my Graph class .
It splits the lirics of a song into its lines loaded as unicode , converts them into a simpler lowercose ASCII form and splits the words of each line , then adds directed arcs for each pair of words to a graph .
Then it saved in Graphviz format , to be shown with the " dot " program .
This is the core of the code :
from graph import Graph def save_graphviz ( lyrics , filepath ) : lyrics_lines = [ line for line in lyrics.lower ( ) .splitlines ( ) if line.strip ( ) ] g = Graph ( ) for line in lyrics_lines : clean_line = " " . join ( ( c if c.isalpha ( ) else " " ) for c in line ) clean_line_conv = clean_line.encode('raw_unicode_escape ' ) line_words = clean_line_conv.split( ) upairs = zip ( line_words , line_words [ 1 : ] ) g.addArcs(upairs ) g.saveDot(fileName=filepath )
And the results :
Click to see full size of " Alla fiera dell est " ( Angelo Branduardi ) .
Click to see full size of " Aqueous transmission " ( Incubus ) .
Click to see full size of " Ballo in Fa diesis minore " ( Angelo Branduardi ) .
Click to see full size of " Bella signora " ( Gianni Morandi ) .
Click to see full size of " Il dono del cervo " ( Angelo Branduardi ) .
Click to see full size of " La serie dei numeri " ( Angelo Branduardi ) .
Click to see full size of " Samarcanda " ( Roberto Vecchioni ) .
The results are interesting .
" Alla fiera dell ' Est " is really simple , because it repeats itself a lot , with just small parts added at each itreration .

KABUL ( Reuters ) - Peace in Afghanistan is undermined by Western nations ’ failure to deliver promised aid and 40 percent of funds that do reach the country return to the West in profits and salaries , aid agencies said on Tuesday .

Afghanistan relies on international aid for 90 percent of its spending as it tries to rebuild state institutions shattered by nearly 30 years of war and at the same time fight off a renewed Taliban insurgency that killed 6,000 people last year .
Foreign spending on aid and development is dwarfed by that spent on international military operations in Afghanistan .
The U.S. military alone now spends some $ 100 million a day fighting Taliban insurgents in Afghanistan , but spending on aid by all donors since 2001 amounts to only $ 7 million a day .
“ Given the links between development and security , the effectiveness of aid also has a major impact on peace and stability , ” the Agency Coordinating Body for Afghan Relief ( ACBAR ) said in a report .
“ Yet thus far aid has been insufficient and in many cases wasteful and ineffective , ” said ACBAR , an umbrella group for non-governmental organizations working in Afghanistan .
Afghanistan received just $ 57 per capita in aid in the two years after international intervention , compared with $ 679 a head in Bosnia and $ 233 in East Timor , it said .
“ $ 10 BILLION SHORTFALL ”
The international community has pledged to spend some $ 25 billion on reconstruction and development in Afghanistan .
But , the report said , “ just $ 15 billion in aid has so far been spent , of which it is estimated a staggering 40 percent has returned to donor countries in corporate profits and salaries ” .
While there are problems delivering development to Afghanistan due to poor security , government corruption and the ability of the country to absorb aid , major donors have fallen far behind on their pledges , ACBAR said .
The United States , by far the biggest donor , has paid out only half of the $ 10 billion it committed in aid to Afghanistan for the period 2002 - 2008 , the Asia Development Bank and India only a third of their pledged assistance for the same period .
Two - thirds of international assistance to Afghanistan bypasses the Afghan government , undermining the rebuilding of its state institutions , the report said .
International donors also do not coordinate well among themselves and with the Afghan government on where their money goes .
“ The Afghan government says it does not have information on how one - third of all assistance since 2001 was spent -- some $ 5 billion , ” the report said .
Norwegian diplomat Kai Eide is soon to arrive as the new U.N. envoy in Kabul with what U.N. officials called a “ sharpened ” role to increase coordination of international efforts in Afghanistan .
“ The new UN envoy to Afghanistan has already highlighted the need for greater effectiveness of the international community effort in support of the government of Afghanistan , ” U.N. spokesman Aleem Siddique said .
“ He has made clear that amongst his first priorities will be to listen to the needs and concerns of the Afghan government and reflect these concerns to Afghanistan ’s partners and donors in order to accelerate progress , improve coordination and overall effectiveness of the international community effort , ” he said .
ACBAR called on donors to increase spending on development and humanitarian aid in Afghanistan , fulfill their pledges of aid , coordinate spending more effectively and channel more funds through the Afghan government .
Some time ago I had a short episode of working for a Polish branch of a Germany based software company .
In this entry ( and probably a few following ) I ’m going to share with you a couple of WTF moments , so if you ’re in for a few good laughs , read on !
There is also part II of this story .
Monday
The first day started quite normal : I was introduced by the company manager to all 7 programmers , divided in two teams .
I was assigned to the smaller , 3 people team .
My first task was to build a computer for myself from parts scattered around the company : the box was here , the harddisk there and the monitor had to be taken “ temporarily ” from one of the servers .
After my computer was up and running , my teammates engaged in a fierce quarrel about which distribution of Linux I should install on my box .
As I learned each of them was running a different one and in the second team the situation was looking similar .
I chose Ubuntu because the guy sitting next to me ( who was assigned as my “ mentor ” ) was using it and he had the install CD ready .
Then the other guys started to remind him that he had several problems with this distribution ( some related to work and some completely unrelated but that seemed irrelevant to them ) and he fought back arguing that they had also trouble with their distros and it was at least as bad as his own if not worse .
From this argument I understood that they had continuous problems with running their app on their systems ( as in “ it works on my box , why does n’t it work on yours ? ” ) and spent quite a lot of time trying to fix them .
It also seemed that each of them used their own set of incompatible tools and scripts which they developed or configured individually .
Do n’t get me wrong : I ’m not trying to prove that they were completely stupid .
It was just the opposite : they were smart , friendly , helpful and fun to talk with .
We spend a lot of time talking about their hobbies , cars , games , movies , music and books .
But at the same time I started to get a feeling that they were completely amateurish in their work .
To the end of first day I managed to get Ubuntu running , installed Eclipse and some other tools and checked out the project from the SVN .
In the meantime , my mentor gave me a talk about the architecture of their system which seemed awfully complicated to me but I decided to keep my comments to myself at least until I get to see and understand the code .
The system was written in Python and its main purpose was to process requests from the web app and issue queries to many different vendors , gather the results and send them back to the web app .
He also told me that they had a big problem with the system being much too heavy and slow .
Tuesday
Next day I started browsing the source and felt my heart sinking like , well , something that is sinking really fast .
So fast it ’s going to fall into pieces when it smacks into the bottom of the sea .
I hoped that their system would be elegant and beautiful just because of being written in Python .
Instead it looked like if someone was trying create Python ’s equivalent of worst PHP anti-patterns .
Most of the classes were several thousand lines long and contained code dealing with everything for one vendor .
Each of those behemoths sported methods of at least 200 lines long but 500 was n’t rare at all .
After taking a closer look I noticed that most of the code was carefully copied / pasted from one place to another .
Each of those methods processed one kind of request from start to end : initialized database connection with hardcoded username and password , constructed and issued the query , processed and formatted the results , caught exceptions and so on .
I regret not running any metrics on this steaming pile of excrements but my guess was that after the duplicated code would be properly refactored into separate methods , it would be 3 to 4 times smaller .
Do I have to add that the system was n’t stained with a single line of test code ?
I started asking the guys about those problems and their answers shocked me even more .
The conversation ran something like this :
Me :
Why do n’t you guys use separate functions to avoid all this code duplication ?
Them :
Do n’t you know that functions induce time overhead ?
Calling them and returning just takes too much time .
Me : AFAIK this overhead is negligible in most cases .
Have you run some profiler to see if calling functions is really a bottleneck here ?
Them :
Of course we have .
But you see this Python profiler is really stupid .
It did n’t tell us anything useful .
I had a hard time believing this but not being an expert in Python profiling myself I decided to leave this path for now and concentrate on other aspects :
Me :
But do n’t you think that this copied / pasted code looks like a mess ?
Them :
Not at all .
You have all the code right before your eyes .
You do n’t have to go looking for a function definition to see what it does .
Me :
What if the duplicated code contained some bug ?
Do n’t you think fixing it would be a problem ?
Them :
How can this be a problem when Eclipse has search &replace function ?
That ’s it for part one , but stay tuned !

90 minute video presentation from Marc Feeley , along with accompanying PowerPoint slides and source code , for a Scheme to C compiler .
Good discussion of continuations and closures , as well as some dipping into the area of compiler construction .
How to write a simple Scheme to C compiler , in Scheme .
In only 90 minutes !
And although not supporting the whole Scheme standard , the compiler supports fully optimized proper tail calls , continuations , and ( of course ) full closures .
The compiler is implemented using two important compilation techniques for functional languages : closure conversion and CPS - conversion .
The emphasis is on the 4 major problem areas that crop up in an attempt to convert Scheme to C :
tail - calls a.k.a. tail - recursion opt .
first - class continuations
closures of indefinite extent
automatic memory management i.e. GC
The solution presented gives a series of source - to - source transformations .
Stage 1 of the compiler expands the ' let ' forms in the Scheme code .
Stage 2 converts continuations to CPS .
Stage 3 converts the code to closures using encapsulated closure objects .
Stage 4 is not presented but touches on how the results would lend itself to a GC implementation .

____/____/2008
A major tightening of the law governing the oversight of drugs companies will be announced today when the government says GlaxoSmithKline delayed informing the authorities that a controversial drug increased the likelihood of suicide among teenagers .
The health minister Dawn Primarolo will tell MPs that new legislation will be introduced by the end of the year to ensure drugs companies pass on results of clinical trials as soon as the alarm is raised about one of their medicines .
The government is to intervene after a four - year investigation by the drug regulatory body into the way GSK withheld the full results of their trials of the antidepressant Seroxat on children .
The trial data , which was finally handed to the Medicines and Healthcare Regulatory Authority ( MHRA ) in May 2003 , identified two problems of which the company had been aware as early as 1998 :
· A higher risk of suicidal behaviour among under 18s using Seroxat rather than a placebo .
· Seroxat was ineffective in dealing with depressive illness among under 18s .
Primarolo will announce that GSK should have told the MHRA earlier than it did about the results .
But GSK will not face criminal prosecutions , she will say , because the legislation in this area is insufficiently clear on whether and when drugs companies should inform the regulator .
The minister will announce that new legislation will be introduced by the end of the year placing a greater obligation on companies to disclose results of trials .
The MHRA 's investigation asked whether GSK had informed the regulatory body in reasonable time .
It shows that the drug company had the information about the potentially suicidal effects of Seroxat and concludes that GSK should have informed the MHRA earlier .
However , it finds that the company acted within the letter of the law by withholding data that would have shown up a problem .
The failure to take stronger action against GSK will anger the many critics of the regulatory body , who say it is not up to the job of policing the pharmaceutical industry .
Patients and some doctors have been urging a tough line against GSK ever since the MHRA suddenly announced , in June 2003 , that doctors must not give Seroxat to children and under 18s .
The agency said it was acting within two weeks of being given the full set of data from trials of Seroxat in children .
The statistics contained in those results showed that the drug was no better than a placebo in alleviating depression in children and that those on the drug were more likely to develop suicidal tendencies than those on placebo .
In one of the trials , 6.5 % of those taking Seroxat became suicidal compared with 1.1 % in the placebo group .
A leaked internal document from GSK , dated to 1998 , said the company would have to " effectively manage the dissemination of these data in order to minimise any potential negative impact " .
In the United States , GSK was sued by the New York state attorney general , Eliot Spitzer , and settled for $ 2.5 m ( £ 1.25 m ) and an agreement to publish all its trial results - negative or positive - on a publicly available database .
Critics have called for big changes to the MHRA .
In its report into the influence of the pharmaceutical industry , the Commons ' health select committee expressed concern that the MHRA did not get all the information it needed from manufacturers before it licensed drugs .
It called for a new regime of random audits of the raw trial data collected by companies and for more staff to be employed .
GSK has always completely rejected allegations that it improperly withheld data on the drug .
It said Seroxat had never been approved by EU or US regulators as a medicine for those under 18 , and that the company had therefore never marketed the drug for that age section .
It also said its trial results had been submitted to regulators and were presented publicly in journals and on its website .

Speed and interactivity
In this version , Inkscape starts using the cairo library for rendering .
It is now used for outline mode display which , thanks to using cairo and other optimizations , redraws faster by about 25 % .
More impressive are memory savings : thanks to cairo , in outline mode Inkscape now takes only about 50 % of the memory used by 0.45 for the same file .
Smart redraw directionality : With complex images and / or on slow computers , you may have noticed that Inkscape redraws the screen image in horizontal strips , and these strips are painted in order from top to bottom .
Now the redraw always starts at your mouse cursor location and proceed upwards and downwards from it , so that the area near the cursor is always redrawn first .
This significantly improves program 's responsiveness in some situations .
For example , when you are node - editing part of a complex path , the entire path needs to be redrawn on each change , but now this redraw starts from the point you 're working on .
Moreover , the redraw is interruptible , so each mouse movement starts new redraw from the mouse cursor area .
As a result , during such operations those parts that you 're working on redraw often and feel snappy and responsive , while areas further away may lag behind more .
Faster blur for exporting and high quality on - screen rendering : Inkscape now uses an IIR ( Infinite Impulse Response ) filter for blurring with large radius .
This greatly improves the speed of blur redraw at high zooms or in high - resolution export ( or simply with very large blur radius ) .
On the other hand , the results are an approximation to a true Gaussian blur , so a drawing may look slightly different from the mathematically precise blur ( usually the differences are far from visible , though ) .
This code is mainly based on : Recursive Gaussian Derivative Filters by L.J. van Vliet , I.T. Young and P.W. Verbeek ( see the source code for more detailed references ) .
Exporting drawings with blur was particularly slow in 0.45 ; some files could take hours to export .
Now this is fixed , in part by the faster algorithm mentioned above and in part by a bugfix in the export code .
Now even the quite complex files with large blurs export at high resolution in at most a few minutes .
Minor improvements have been made to gradient rendering performance .
Dragging handles and nodes as well as dragging and transforming objects by mouse became more responsive , so that working in complex drawings and especially editing complex paths is noticeably easier .
In particular , this fixes the annoying latency issue where a node or a handle could follow mouse cursor even after you release mouse button after a drag .
Moving objects , nodes , and gradient handles by cursor keys as well as scaling and rotating objects from keyboard and zooming by keys are much more responsive when working with complex slow - rendering objects .
Now , if you press and hold a key , your selection / zoom level will quickly jump to the final position instead of going through all the intermediate steps as before .
Moving the cursor around in a file with large and complex paths has become much snappier and more responsive .
Previously , in extreme cases Inkscape could freeze for seconds while catching up with the mouse cursor ; such delays are now eliminated .
Several improvements make canvas panning and scrolling smoother and more interactive in complex slow - rendering documents :
When panning by the middle mouse button , Inkscape no longer attempts to redraw the canvas while your mouse button is pressed .
Any redrawing only happens after you release the mouse .
As a result , the newly revealed parts of the canvas are somewhat more " dirty " but the panning is smoother than before , with few if any " hiccups " .
Redrawing the newly exposed parts of the canvas after scrolling , especially diagonal scrolling , is now faster because only the exposed areas are redrawn ; before , this often resulted in the entire screen being redrawn which was much slower .
Previously , if you started panning with middle button while Inkscape is still redrawing screen in a complex drawing , panning sometimes completely failed or moved canvas just a little step .
Now it is guaranteed to pan the canvas all the way from mouse - press point to mouse - release point in any case , even if sometimes it fails to show the intermediate positions .
When pressing and holding Ctrl+arrows to scroll canvas , Inkscape normally accelerates scrolling so that each next scrolling step is bigger than the previous .
Previously , in complex drawings this acceleration sometimes got interrupted , which made scrolling annoyingly bumpy and slow .
Now this is fixed so that scrolling is smoothly accelerated even in a slow - rendering document .
The default starting speed and acceleration of Ctrl+arrows scrolling are slightly increased .
( They are both settable in Preferences . )
Better responsiveness and more visual feedback in user interface :
When you zoom , the zoom control on the right end of the statusbar now updates immediately , not after screen redraw as before .
Many potentially slow commands ( Save , Simplify , Combine , Break Apart and others ) now display a busy cursor and flash a message in the statusbar ( e.g . " Saving document ... " ) while they work .
The statusbar messages displayed while you 're drawing a shape or a path in Pen tool do not lag behind the mouse movements .
Combine and Convert to paths commands are now orders of magnitude faster when applied to a selection with hundreds or thousands of objects .
The time it takes to snap to objects using the selector tool has been reduced dramatically , which is most noticeable for snapping to complex paths .
Paint Bucket tool
The new Paint Bucket tool works exactly as you would expect : click in any area bounded on all sides and it will fill it with color .
Being a vector tool , however , Inkscape 's Paint Bucket just creates a new path that " fills in " the area in which you clicked .
How it works
It is important to note that the tool is perceptual , not geometric .
That is , when looking for the boundaries around the point you clicked , it takes for such boundaries any visible color changes .
This means that filling will stop at gradients , blurs , and even the color boundaries in imported bitmaps , but will ignore any paths or other objects that are fully ( or almost ) transparent or for any other reason do not stand out from the background .
In short , it will work exactly as if you were filling a rasterized version of your image in a bitmap editor like Photoshop or GIMP - but will give you a vector object to work with .
For example , now you can scan a pencil sketch , import the bitmap into Inkscape , and quickly fill all its cells with colors even without tracing the bitmap first .
This is a very convenient and interactive way of digitizing your paper drawings , making the traditional bitmap tracing unnecessary in many cases .
Internally , the tool works by performing a bitmap - based flood fill on a rendered version of the visible canvas , then tracing the resulting fill using potrace and placing the traced path into the document .
It places the rendered path onto the current layer , so you can have a layer on top ( for example , " Inks " ) and select the layer below ( " Colors " ) and do the fills so that they always appear below the Inks .
The resolution of the bitmap image used to perform the trace is dependent upon your current zoom level -- the more zoomed in to an area that you are , the higher the resolution of the bitmap - based flood fill .
So , if you are got a fill that is too imprecise , has rough corners , or do n't go into small nooks and appendices where it is supposed to go , just undo , zoom in closer and repeat filling from the same point .
Conversely , if the fill leaks out through a small gap , zoom out to make the gap less visible and fill again ( or use the auto gap closing parameter , see below ) .
Style
Like all object - creating tools , the Paint Bucket may use the last - set style for the objects it creates ( this is the default ) , or it can use its own fixed style .
You can switch between these modes on this tool 's page in Inkscape Preferences ( Ctrl + Shift + P ) .
As in all other tools , the style swatch on the far right of the Controls bar shows the style that will be used for the next fill object you create .
Controls
In the tool 's Controls bar :
Paint Bucket 's perceptual fill can use either all visible colors or specific color channels .
Using the Fill by drop - down list , you can restrict the fill algorithm to one the following channels : Red Green Blue Hue Saturation Lightness Alpha
drop - down list , you can restrict the fill algorithm to one the following channels :
The Threshold ( in per cent units ) controls how large must be color difference at a point ( compared to the initial click point ) to stop the fill .
Zero tolerance means only the area of strictly the same color will be filled ; the larger the tolerance , the easier it will be for the fill to leak into adjacent different - color areas .
The default value is 10 % .
Using the Grow / shrink by parameter , you can control the amount of inset / outset to be applied to the created fill path .
Setting a positive outset causes fill paths to be larger than the filled bitmap area ( good for eliminating anti-aliasing errors ) , while setting a negative outset causes the path to be smaller .
This works much the same as the Outset and Inset path commands , except it 's done automatically after every fill .
With the Close gaps parameter , you can make the Paint Bucket tool ignore any gaps in the area boundaries that would normally cause the fill to spill out of the desired area .
There are four settings to auto gap : None Small ( close gaps up to 2 pixels in size ) Medium ( 4 pixels ) Large ( 6 pixels )
parameter , you can make the Paint Bucket tool ignore any gaps in the area boundaries that would normally cause the fill to spill out of the desired area .
There are four settings to auto gap :
Note that setting this parameter to other than None may slow down noticeably the filling of large areas .
Shortcuts
The tool 's shortcuts are :
Single click performs filling from the click point .
Shift + click performs filling from the click point and then unions the resulting path with the selected path .
This way , if your first attempt did not fill in all of the desired area , you can Shift + click the remaining corner to fill it in separately and combine the result with the result of the previous fill .
Ctrl+click on an object simply changes that object 's fill to the current fill color of the tool , and Shift + Ctrl+click changes the stroke to the current stroke color .
Click and drag performs filling from all of the points that you pass while dragging ( you will see your path visualized by a red line ) .
From each point , the fill spreads to the neighbors with the colors similar to that point - in other words , it 's like clicking with this tool at each point of the drag path and unioning the results .
This lets you easily fill an area occupied by a gradient or blur - just drag from the darkest to the lightest points in the area you want to fill .
Alt+click and drag works similarly to simple drag , except from each point of the drag path , the fill spreads to the neighbors ( if any ) with the colors similar to the initial point ( the point where you started the drag ) .
This lets you fill a series of similarly - colored yet separated areas ( for example , multiple cells in a cartoon ) by starting the drag in one of those areas , and alt + dragging the tool through all the other areas .
Tweak tool
The Tweak tool is an exciting new way to edit drawings which largely blurs the distinction between vector and raster editing .
Instead of meticulously selecting some objects and then performing an action on the selection , you can now select all objects ( or all objects you are interested in ) and apply the Tweak tool 's brush to smoothly and naturally change the shape or style of only those objects ( or parts thereof ) that the brush touches .
The area of the tool 's action - its brush - is marked by an orange - colored circular outline that moves with your mouse cursor .
However , that area actually has no sharp boundaries ; the power of the tool 's action falls off gradually , following a smooth bell - shaped profile .
This makes the tool act softly and smoothly .
The tool will work on any number of selected objects ; for example , you can select all ( Ctrl+A ) and " smear " your entire drawing by Push mode or paint it by Color Paint mode .
You can also apply it to groups of objects ; it will go into groups and act on individual objects inside groups .
If you 're trying to use it without anything selected , a message will appear in the statusbar reminding you to select some objects .
Width
The width of the tool 's brush , in the range from 1 to 100 , can be changed by the Width control in the tool 's controls bar above the canvas .
You can also change width by Left and Right arrow keys ( same as in the Calligraphy tool ) at any time ( including during action ) as well as Home and End .
Also , as in Calligraphy tool , the visible width of the brush is independent of zoom ; simply zooming in or out is often easier than adjusting the width if you want to cover a smaller or larger area of the drawing .
Force
The next control is Force which adjusts the power of the action , also in the range from 1 to 100 .
You can also change width by Up and Down arrow keys at any time ( including during action ) .
If you have a pressure - sensitive tablet and your " Use pressure " button on the right - hand end of the controls bar is on , then the force will also depend on how hard you actually press your pen into your tablet , changing in the range from zero to whatever you set in the Force control .
If all you have is a mouse , then the force will be constant but still settable by the Force control .
Path editing modes
The Tweak tool has a number of modes , selectable by toggle buttons in the tool 's Controls bar and by keyboard shortcuts .
Some of these modes change the shapes of paths while others affect the colors of objects .
All these modes share the Width and Force controls but otherwise are quite different .
Let 's look at the path editing modes first .
Unlike the Node tool , to edit paths with the Tweak tool you do n't need to worry about where the nodes of a path are and how to manipulate them .
You just apply the tool 's brush to any point , and the selected paths at that point will reshape smoothly and naturally - as if made of soft jelly - regardless of where its nodes lie .
If applied to a shape or text object , the tool converts them to paths automatically .
While not very useful for technical drawings , tweaking paths will be indispensable for artistic uses of Inkscape - cartoons , drawings , sketches , anime , etc .
This new functionality is somewhat similar to the tools such as " Pucker " and " Bloat " in the latest versions of Adobe Illustrator .
There are currently six path editing modes in the Tweak tool : Push , Shrink , Grow , Attract , Repel , and Roughen .
This default mode of the tool , Push , simply displaces the part of the path under the cursor in the direction of the drag .
The path behaves like soft jelly , bending and bulging smoothly and naturally .
It 's an easy way to produce various irregular , lifelike , handmade - looking shapes starting from something as simple as an ellipse or a calligraphic stroke .
For parallel - stroke hatching ( engraving ) done in the Calligraphy tool , pushing is an easy way to bend , pinch , or curve the entire hatching uniformly .
The Shrink and Grow are two opposite modes that move each point of a path in a direction perpendicular to the path 's surface at the point , either inwards ( Shrink ) or outwards ( Grow ) .
This is similar to the Inset and Outset commands , except that the Tweak tool can act on a part of a path instead of the whole path .
For example , the visible lightness / darkness of an engraving hatching may not exactly correspond to your artistic intention .
Also , the ends of Calligraphy pen strokes are often far from ideal - they may be too blunt or have unsightly bends or blobs .
This is where the Tweak tool may help .
Select all the strokes in a hatching pattern and apply a light Shrink action where you want the lines to become thinner ( and the hatching to become lighter ) , up until total disappearance .
If you press hard , shrinking works as an eraser , so you can easily clean the strokes ' ends to make them thin , sharp , and uniform .
Conversely , applying Grow makes strokes wider ( i.e. the hatching becomes darker ) .
Of course , shrinking and growing are useful not only for calligraphic strokes .
Same as with Push , with Shrink and Grow you can sculpt any path , spawning smooth treacle - like appendages with Grow and carving holes with Shrink .
Unlike the " node sculpting " mode in the Node tool , however , this does not require adding new nodes to the shape .
The Attract and Repel modes work by moving each affected point on a path towards ( Attract ) or from ( Repel ) the cursor point .
In some cases this may look similar to Shrink and Grow , but the difference is that shrinking / growing moves paths perpendicularly to the path in each point , whereas attracting / repelling moves them to or from the cursor regardless of the path shape .
These modes are similar to the Pinch effect in AI ; you can use them for various central - symmetric distortions in parts of your paths .
The Roughen mode does exactly this : roughens the edge of the path without changing its overall shape .
Slight roughening simply makes the edge crooked and uneven ; strong roughening tears and explodes the edge into random blobs and splotches .
Note that this operation , especially with high Fidelity , adds a lot of nodes which increases the size of your SVG document and may slow down Inkscape considerably .
In particular , pushing , shrinking , or growing of a roughened path becomes much slower and more difficult , so it 's recommended to finalize the overall shape of a path first and roughen it , if necessary , only as the final step .
See the screenshot at [ 1 ] for a few examples of using the path editing modes of the Tweak tool .
Fidelity
Any tweaking of a path slightly distorts the entire path , including even those parts that you did n't touch .
These distortions are similar to those that a Simplify command produces .
The Fidelity value ( also in the range from 1 to 100 , default is 50 ) allows you to control the amount of these distortions .
With a higher fidelity , the distortions are less noticeable , but the path may end up having a lot of nodes which inflates up the SVG size and slows down Inkscape .
The best value of Fidelity depends on the nature of your artwork .
If you 're sculpting an amorphous blob , you can do with low fidelity of about 20 .
If , however , you are pushing or inflating a text string ( as a single path ) and want the letters outside the distorted area to remain crisp and clean , you will need to raise fidelity to 80 or more .
Known problems
Known problems with the path editing modes in Tweak tool :
they do n't work on open paths ( an open path becomes closed if you tweak it ) ; they are rather slow ; they quickly eat memory ; and they are sometimes buggy - thin calligraphic strokes may suddenly disappear or change their shape drastically as you 're shrinking or growing them .
For ( 4 ) , it helps to increase Fidelity .
Also , you can undo the bad change and try again with less pressure on the pen - if you do your thinning in several light touches instead of one heavy press , usually you will be able to get the desired result without the buggy behavior .
Also , sometimes after roughening , further tweaking of a path becomes impossible with this diagnostic :
WARNING **: Shape error in ConvertToShape : directedEulerian ( a ) == false
All these problems stem from the livarot library that we use for geometric manipulation of paths .
Fortunately , livarot is scheduled for replacement by lib2geom , a new library now in development , so hopefully these issues will be addressed then .
Color editing modes
The Color Paint and Color Jitter modes , unlike the path editing modes , change the colors of objects instead of their shapes .
Yet they share enough common features with the path editing modes to be part of the same tool :
These modes also use a circular soft - edged brush controlled by the Width and Force parameters on the Controls bar and affected by the pen pressure ( if you have a pressure - sensitive tablet ) .
Color Paint applies the style of the tool to the selected objects under the brush .
The style of the tool is visible in the style swatch at the rightmost end of the tool 's control bar ; it can be changed by clicking on the color palette or by any other style assignment command , such as Fill and Stroke dialog .
( Note : unlike all other tools , in Tweak tool in Color Paint mode you cannot assign style directly to selected objects ; any style - setting command changes the tool 's style instead . )
The fill from the tool 's style applies to the fills of the painted objects , and the stroke applies to the strokes .
If the tool 's style has no fill or no stroke , it wo n't affect fills or strokes , correspondingly .
For example , if you want to color the fills of objects blue but leave their strokes untouched , assign blue fill to the tool 's style ( just click blue on the palette ) but set its stroke to None ( middle - click the Stroke swatch in the statusbar ) .
Similarly , master opacity in the tool 's style affects master opacities of the touched objects ( if the O channel is on , see below ) .
This mode allows you to literally paint over objects , shifting their colors towards the target style of the tool .
For example , if you paint with yellow fill over a blue - filled object , the object will become greenish blue , then green , then yellowish green , and end up being exactly the yellow color you 're painting with .
This speed of this gradual transition depends on both Force parameter and pen pressure ; also , objects touched by the periphery of the brush are less affected than those hit by the brush center .
Overall , using this tool is very similar to a soft brush in a raster editor such as Gimp or Photoshop .
Color Jitter mode does not apply any color , but instead jitters ( randomizes ) the colors of the objects it touches .
The force of the action determines how strong is the randomization , i.e. how far the colors deviate from the original values .
This mode does not use the tool 's style .
Both modes work on flat fills and gradients ; for gradients , the tool takes into account not only the position of the entire object with gradient , but also the position of each gradient stop relative to the brush .
This means that , for example , you can change the blue color only in an object filled with blue - red gradient simply by painting over its blue end with a brush small enough to not touch the red .
( Note that color tweaking does not create gradients on objects that used flat color before , but only adjusts existing gradients in the drawing . )
See the screenshot at [ 2 ] for a few examples of using the color editing modes of the Tweak tool .
Channels
Color Paint and Color Jitter honor the Channels control .
This control comprises the four buttons : H , S , L , and O , which allow you to turn on and off the tool 's action on the object 's hue , saturation , lightness , and opacity , correspondingly .
For example , if you want to raise the saturation of some part of your drawing without changing the hue , select some maximum - saturation color ( e.g. pure red ) and turn off all Channels buttons except S. Similarly , you can replace the hues without affecting saturation or lightness ( only H pressed ) , or lighten / darken all colors without changing their hues and saturation ( only L pressed ) .
Pressing O allows you to apply the master opacity from the tool 's style to the master opacity of objects ( but not fill or stroke opacity ) .
Usage notes
Color painting with Tweak tool is similar , but not exactly analogous to bitmap painting .
Even though the tool itself works as a soft brush , it still applies its color to vector objects , which behave as vector objects usually do .
For example , if you want to change the tint of the face in your drawing , and if a hand in the drawing is part of the same object as the face , that hand will change its tint too even if it 's located far from the point you are painting .
( We foresee a " fracture " command in one of the next versions of Inkscape which will help you turn a monolithic object into a mosaic of small fragments that will be then easy to paint with Tweak tool . )
Still , even with this limitation , color painting is a novel way of dealing with vector drawings which allows you to quickly and intuitively make adjustments which would be awkward and slow with traditional approach .
Drawings containing patterns or scatterings of small independent objects are best suited for color painting with Tweak tool .
Examples include :
freehand drawings with Calligraphy pen , consisting of many separate strokes ;
gradient meshes imported from Adobe Illustrator files ( Inkscape renders these meshes as lattices of small polygons ; while there 's no direct support for gradient meshes in Inkscape yet , color painting on such lattices is almost as good ) ;
text converted to paths and with Break Apart command applied so that each letter is a separate path ;
patterns made with the Tile Clones command ; note that you need to unset the fill and / or stroke on the original object and use the Color tab to assign some initial color to the clones - this will make them paintable with the Tweak tool without unlinking .
Moreover , color tweaking can be useful for compositions with a few objects or even for single objects .
Unlike all other color selection methods , painting with the Tweak tool implements the color mixing metaphor which is much more familiar to traditional artists than RGB sliders or even the color wheel .
For example , start with a rectagle of pure blue color ; then , pick different colors by Color Paint and apply light touches with minimum Force and minimum pen pressure : add a little green , a little brown , a little yellow , etc. until you have the exact hue you need .
Similarly , you can whiten or blacken any hue by admixing white or black .
You can also use color tweaking to add a tint , darken / lighten , saturate / desaturate , or color jitter your entire drawing .
Just select all in all layers , zoom out , choose a large brush width so it covers all of the drawing , and apply a little color tweaking ( with minimum Force ) that will therefore affect all visible objects .

3D Box tool
Inkscape is a two - dimensional drawing tool .
However , very often it is used to create drawings or objects that appear three - dimensional .
The new 3D box tool helps you create such drawings by automating the most common operation : creating a box in a given 3D perspective .
The tool automatically ensures that all sides of the box lie on the corresponding perspective lines .
We 're not going to compete with Blender - but even simple things can go a long way .
Currently in the 3D
Box tool you can :
Draw a 3D box by dragging on canvas ; Shift +drag without releasing the mouse button to extrude in Z direction .
Adjust any of its 3 dimensions by handles .
The 4 handles on the front X/Y side resize it , the four ones on the back X/Y side expand / contract the box in Z direction .
With Shift , the functions of handles on front and back sides are reversed .
With Ctrl , the side - resizing handles snap to the coordinate axes or diagonals .
Move a 3D box " in perspective " by dragging its center ; without modifiers , movement occurs within the XY - plane ( press Ctrl to constrain the movement to the directions of the coordinate axes or diagonals ) , with Shift the box moves parallel to the Z-axis .
Adjust the vanishing points of a perspective by dragging them on the canvas ( see below ) or toggling their states ; all boxes sharing this perspective are affected by a vanishing point move .
When several boxes are selected , all vanishing points of their associated perspectives are shown on the canvas .
If vanishing points of different perspectives coincide , they are combined in a single " dragger " .
Moving this dragger moves all the vanishing points simultaneously and transforms the associated boxes accordingly .
Note that some non-selected boxes may also be reshaped if their perspectives share the same vanishing point .
Pressing
Shift while moving the dragger can be used to only transform the selected boxes , separating their perspectives from the non-selected ones ' .
On the other hand , when a vanishing point being dragged comes close enough to another one , both snap together and are combined in a single dragger .
In SVG , a 3D box is represented as a group ( svg:g ) with a special extension attribute ( in Inkscape 's namespace ) ; this group contains the 6 quadrilateral paths representing the sides of the box .
Only the 3D box tool treats this object as a box ; for all other tools it is just a group , so you can select any of the paths by Ctrl+click , apply any style to it , delete it , etc .
You can of course transform the entire box or any face in it using Selector or Node tools .
Keyboard shortcuts
X , Shift + F4 : switch to the 3D box tool
The various kinds of parentheses , namely [ ] , ( ) , { } , can be used to rotate infinite ( i.e. , parallel ) perspective lines in X- , Y- , and Z - direction , respectively .
Closing parentheses rotate clockwise and opening parentheses rotate counterclockwise .
The angle of rotation is taken from the preferences .
Pressing
Alt reduces the amount of rotation to 1 screen pixel .
When the 3D box tool is active , Shift+X , Shift +Y , and Shift + Z toggle perspective lines in the corresponding direction between " converging " and " parallel " .
Gradient Tool
Selecting multiple stops
More than one gradient stop can be selected at a time .
Shortcuts for working with multiple stop selections are generally modeled on the Node tool .
Add a stop to the selected stops by Shift + click .
. Press Ctrl +A to select all stops in the selected objects .
to select all stops in the selected objects .
Shift + drag around stops to add them to selection .
Multiple selected stops :
Can be moved together by mouse drag or by arrow keys .
For example , creating a linear gradient , then press Ctrl +
A to select all stops and use arrow keys to move the entire gradient as a whole .
or by .
For example , creating a linear gradient , then press Ctrl +
A to select all stops and use arrow keys to move the entire gradient as a whole .
Can be deleted at the same time by pressing Del .
An always up - to - date description of the current handle selection is provided in the statusbar in the Gradient tool , including the number of selected handles ( and the type of the single selected handle ) , as well as the total number of handles and selected objects .
Editing intermediate stops
Intermediate stops in gradients can be added , deleted , and edited on canvas ( previously this was only possible in the Gradient Editor dialog ) .
Stops can be added by double clicking or by Ctrl + Alt + Click on the gradient line .
Also , you can drag - and - drop a color from the palette onto the gradient line to create a new stop with this color .
Dropping a color on an existing stop changes the color of that stop .
or by on the gradient line .
Also , you can a color from the palette onto the gradient line to create a new stop with this color .
Dropping a color on an existing stop changes the color of that stop .
When two or more adjacent stops are selected , pressing Ins adds stops in the middles of all selected stop intervals .
adds stops in the middles of all selected stop intervals .
Intermediate stops can be mousedragged or moved by arrow keys along their gradient line , within the limits of the adjacent unselected stops ( or end handles ) .
Dragging with Ctrl moves the selected stops snapping them to 1/10 fractions of the available range .
moves the selected stops snapping them to 1/10 fractions of the available range .
Dragging with
Alt moves the selected stops depending on how close each one is to the stop being dragged , using a smooth bell - like curve similar to the node sculpting feature in Node tool .
This makes it easy to approximate different gradient profiles ; for example , if you have a two - stop gradient that you want to shape according to a curve profile , select both ends of the gradient , press
Ins a few times to add a number of intermediate nodes , then Alt +drag a node in the middle to smoothly profile the gradient .
Stops can also be moved by arrow keys with all the regular modifiers ( Shift for 10 x movement , Alt for pixel - size movement at the current zoom , Shift +
Alt for 10 pixels movement at the current zoom ) .
with all the regular modifiers ( for 10 x movement , for pixel - size movement at the current zoom , for 10 pixels movement at the current zoom ) .
Stops can be deleted by Ctrl + Alt + Click on a stop or by the Del key for all the selected stop(s ) .
When you delete an end stop , the nearest intermediate stop becomes the new end stop of the gradient ( without moving - i.e. , the gradient span becomes shorter ) .
When you delete an end stop and there are no intermediate stops , the object will be painted with a solid fill taken from the color & opacity of the remaining stop .
Pressing Ctrl+L with some intermediate stops selected attempts to simplify the selected portion of the gradient , removing those stops that can be removed without too much change in the way the gradient looks .
In particular , new stops created by double - clicking or pressing Ins initially do not change the appearance of the gradient , so if you press Ctrl+L , all redundant stops that were n't moved or repainted since creation will be deleted .
Style of gradient stops
When you have one of the gradient handles selected , its style ( color and opacity ) is reflected by the selected style indicator ( left of the statusbar ) and the Fill & Stroke dialog .
Previously , opacity of a gradient handle was reflected as fill - opacity and stroke - opacity ; now it is reflected as master opacity ( the " O : " spinbutton in the selected style indicator , the " Master opacity " slider in Fill & Stroke ) .
This makes it much easier to view and change opacity of gradient handles using only the selected style indicator in the statusbar .
When multiple gradient stops are selected , the selected style indicator ( in the statusbar ) displays and controls the averaged color and opacity of the selected stops .
When one or more gradient stops are selected , using the Copy command ( Ctrl+C ) copies to the clipboard the style ( color and opacity ) of the selected stop or the averaged style of several selected stops , not the entire object with gradient as before .
This means you can now copy / paste style between stops : select the source stop(s ) , copy , select the destination stop(s ) , paste style ( Ctrl + Shift + V ) .
With several selected stops , this also allows you to easily average their colors and opacities by copying them and pasting the style back onto them .
( After that , redundant gradient stops can be removed by simplification with Ctrl+L ) .
) copies to the clipboard the style ( color and opacity ) of the selected stop or the averaged style of several selected stops , not the entire object with gradient as before .
This means you can now copy / paste style between stops : select the source stop(s ) , copy , select the destination stop(s ) , paste style ( ) .
With several selected stops , this also allows you to easily average their colors and opacities by copying them and pasting the style back onto them .
( After that , redundant gradient stops can be removed by simplification with ) .
If the selected object (s ) have gradient in fill or stroke , the selected style indicator in the bottom - left corner of the editing window now displays a live gradient preview prefixed by R or L to indicate Radial or Linear gradients ( instead of displaying " L Gradient " or " R Gradient " text labels as before ) .
Also , this and other similar widget now use italic font face to indicate None and bold to indicate Unset .
Automatic duplication of gradients
When copy / pasting or duplicating an object with gradient , it now automatically gets a copy of the original gradient , so modifying it does not affect the source object 's gradient anymore ( before , you had to press the Duplicate button on the Gradient controls bar for this ) .
The Duplicate button is therefore removed .
However , to accommodate the needs of users who have relied on sharing the same gradient definition across objects , this behavior can be optionally suppressed .
The Prevent sharing of gradient definitions checkbox on the Misc tab of Inkscape Preferences is by default checked ; if you uncheck it , Inkscape does not automatically copy gradient definitions for new objects , which means that copy / pasting , duplicating , pasting style , and explicit assignment of a gradient to an object via the Gradient tool controls results in a shared gradient definition , so that changing the colors or mid-stop positions of the gradient on one object ( but not changing the coordinates of the end handles ) affects all other objects that share the same definition .
Calligraphy tool : Engraver 's Toolbox
Several new features were added to the Calligraphic pen to make Inkscape capable of the ancient art of line engraving .
Traditional engraving is a very labour - intensive process , and while for a long time it was the only practical way of reproducing lifelike images in black - and - white print , about a century ago it was almost completely displaced by automatic halftone screens .
However , line engravings have their characteristic charm , and there 's no reason not to try to resurrect this art form with the help of Inkscape .
A brief visual guide to the new functionality can be seen on these screenshots :
http://inkscape.org/screenshots/gallery/inkscape-0.46-engraving1.png
http://inkscape.org/screenshots/gallery/inkscape-0.46-engraving2.png
Tracking a guide path with Ctrl
One of the most common operations in line engraving is hatching ( or sometimes cross - hatching when several hatching grids cross ) : filling a space with many parallel straight or variously curved lines ( usually of varying width to represent a gradual shading ) .
You could try to achieve a similar effect with e.g. path interpolation ( blending ) , but it is rather cumbersome and limited ; manual drawing of hatch lines , on the other hand , is tedious and nearly impossible to do uniformly .
Now Inkscape provides " assisted hatching " by tracking a guide path , allowing you to hatch quickly and uniformly and at the same time giving you sufficient manual control over the process .
Here 's how to do this .
First , select the guide path that you will track .
It may be another calligraphic stroke , any path or shape , or even a letter of a text object .
Then switch to Calligraphic pen , select the desired parameters ( line width , angle , fixation etc. ) and , before starting to draw , press Ctrl .
You will see a gray track circle centered at your mouse pointer and touching the closest point on the selected guide path .
( If you have no guide path selected , a statusbar message will tell you to select it . )
Now move your mouse close to the guide path , so that the track circle radius is equal to the desired spacing of your hatch pattern , and start drawing along the guide path .
At that moment , the radius of the circle gets locked ; now the circle slides along the guide path - and the actual stroke is drawn by the center of the tracking circle , not by your mouse point .
As a result , you are getting a smooth stroke going parallel to the guide path and always at the same distance from it .
When the stroke is ready , release your mouse button ( or lift your tablet pen ) but do not let go of the Ctrl key because as long as you have it pressed , the tool remembers the hatch spacing you set when you started drawing .
Now , you have just created a new stroke and , as usual with Inkscape tools , it gets selected instead of what was selected before .
In our case , this means that the newly drawn stroke itself becomes the new guide path .
Next , you can draw a second stroke along the first one , then a third one along the second , etc .
Eventually you can fill any desired space with uniform hatching .
Alternatively , if you uncheck " Select new path " in the Calligraphy tool preferences , newly created strokes will not be selected , so your original guide path will be kept selected .
In this mode , Inkscape will increase the tracking distance after each created stroke so that you can create uniformly spaced hatching by tracking a single guide path .
The attachment to the guide path is not absolute .
If you stray your mouse pointer far enough from the guide path , you will be able to tear it off ( the track circle turns from green to red ) and move freely .
This is intentional ; this feature allows you , for example , to continue drawing a stroke past the end of a guide stroke , thus making your hatching cover a wider area than the initial guide path .
Special care is taken to make such tearing off as smooth as possible and to suppress violent jerks , but this is not always possible ; the general advice is to not try to hatch too fast .
If jerking and unintended tearoffs still bother you , try increasing the Mass parameter .
Also , special code is in place to prevent flipovers - accidental jumps to the other side of the guide path .
Brief flipovers are suppressed , but if you intentionally go over to the other side and stay there , eventually Inkscape will obey and your tracking stroke will also flip over to follow you .
Tracking a guide also allows some slight feedback by gradually changing the tracking distance in response to your drawing behavior .
Thus , if you 're consistently trying to draw closer or farther from the guide than the current tracking distance , the distance will correspondingly decrease or increase , so you will get a hatching that is slightly spacing in or out .
( The effect is very slight , however , so as not to become a nuisance . )
Also , note that since tracking follows the edge of the stroke , strokes of varying width ( such as those tracing background , see below ) will result in gradual bending of the hatching pattern as you proceed .
Tracing background by stroke width
There is a new toggle button on the Calligraphy tool 's controls bar , Trace background .
When on , the width of your pen depends on the lightness of the background under the stroke in each point , so that white translates into the minimum stoke width ( 1 ) and black translates to the maximum ( which is set by the Width parameter ) .
This can work alone or in combination with pressure sensitivity , depending on whether the " Use pressure " button is also toggled .
This feature allows you to not only hatch over an imported bitmap image or any drawing , but to do so automatically reproducing the highlights and shades of the background with your strokes becoming lighter and heavier as needed .
Misc features
For consistency with other drawing tools , drawing with Shift in Calligraphy tool automatically unions the newly created stroke with whatever paths were selected ( and selects the result ) .
Thus , you can do a series of overlapping Shift + strokes to create one unioned path object instead of separate objects as before .
To facilitate changing the Width parameter , the Home / End keys in Calligraphy tool switch you to the minimum ( 1 ) and maximum ( 100 ) width , correspondingly .
( This is in addition to the Left / Right arrow keys that change Width by 1 ; remember also that you can press Alt+X , type any width , and press Enter . )
Selector
A new selection mode is available : selecting by touch .
In this mode , you draw a freehand path across the objects ; when you release mouse button , all objects that are touched by this path get selected .
This mode is very convenient in situations where you need to select objects so intermingled that selecting them by the rectangular rubberband is too difficult and so numerous that click - selecting them one by one is too tedious .
To activate selecting by touch , whenever you are drawing a rubberband rectangle , just press
Alt to switch it to the touch mode .
The rectangle will disappear and a red touch path will be shown instead .
When dragging from an empty space , you can press
Alt first and then start to drag to get the touch mode ( note that your selection must be empty , otherwise Alt + dragging will move the selected objects instead ) .
To start a touch selection from a point over an object , or to add to existing selection by touching , press Shift +
Alt and then start to drag .
Previously , the only way to switch selection from scale mode to rotate mode or back was to click on it , which was rather inconvenient when the selected object is in a group or under other objects .
Now you can switch modes with keyboard as well by pressing Shift + S in Selector tool .
Draging the scale handles with
Alt now scales selection by an integer factor , i.e. up to 2 , 3 , 4 , etc. times the original size or down to 1/ 2 .
1/3 , 1/4 , etc. of the original size ( in any of the two dimensions independently ) , as well as to - 1/3 , - 1/2 , - 1 , - 2 , - 3 , etc .
This way you can , for example , mirror any object around one of the edges of its box .
( This replaces the old and rarely used " slow " scaling mode with Alt . )
Horizontal / vertical flipping :
So far , flipping a selection made it flip within its bounding box , so that the latter remained fixed .
In the move / scale mode of the selector tool , this behaviour remains unchanged .
However , in rotate / shear mode flipping now happens about an ( imaginary ) vertical / horizontal axis through the rotation center .
This is very handy , since the latter can be freely dragged around and snaps to all kinds of objects if desired .
Node tool
If any of the nodes in the currently selected path is mouseovered , then horizontal / vertical flipping ( ' H ' and ' V ' keys ) , stepwise rotation ( ' [ ' and ' ] ' keys ) and scaling ( ' < ' and ' >' keys ) now all use this specific node as center / axis .
If there is no mouseovered node , the center of the bounding box is used instead ( as is currently the case unconditionally ) .
Nodes that are covered by one of their handles are also detected as mouseovered .
As a long - requested feature , two entry fields are added to the toolbar which allow precise editing of the coordinates of selected nodes .
Rectangle Tool
Ctrl +dragging now also allows the creation of rectangles with sides constrained to the golden ratio ( approx . 1 : 1.618034 ) , not only integer ratios .
Ellipse Tool
It is now easy to create ellipses / circles passing through particular points .
Normally , the starting and ending point of the mouse drag mark the corners of the bounding box .
Now the Alt modifier can be used to enlarge the ellipse so that its circumference passes through these two points .
Ctrl + Alt+drag is an exception from this rule .
It creates a perfect circle whose diameter is defined by the starting and ending point of the drag .
These tools can now create single dots by Ctrl+click on the canvas .
This creates a small circle filled with the current stroke color .
The radius can be set in the Preferences of the respective tools ( it is specified as a multiple of the current stroke width ) .
Shift + Ctrl+click creates a dot twice the specified size , and Alt + Ctrl+click varies the size of the created dots randomly .
Dropper Tool
The shortcut ' D ' is now used to toggle ( not just switch to ) the dropper tool - much like space is used to toggle the selector tool .
That is , pressing ' D ' a second time switches back to the tool used before .
SVG features
The tref element
Inkscape can now correctly open files with tref elements , and new tref elements can be created manually in the XML editor .
The actual character data contained in a text element can either be embedded directly , or it can be the character content of an element referenced by a tref .
While the textual content from the referenced element will be stripped of any markup before being used by the tref , the tref element can itself have the same attributes as a tspan .
In fact , when rendered , it is as though the tref element is replaced by a tspan with the same attributes , and the referenced character data is embedded in that tspan .
The property xlink : href is used to refer to another element whose character data will be used .
Any element can be referred to except an ancestor of the tref .
When any of the text contained in the referred element changes , the tref will immediately be updated to display the new data .
Existing tref elements can be converted into tspan elements with Edit > Clone > Unlink Clone .
If more than one tref is contained within a selection , all trefs will be converted into tspans .
All attributes applied to the tref will be retained in the new tspan .
A tref element can be mixed with any other elements allowed to be contained by a text element .
The cloned character data rendered by the tref may not be edited , but any characters surrounding it can be changed .
Styles cannot be applied to a subset of the cloned characters , but if all are selected , a style can be applied to the tref .
SVG filters
New filters supported
The feBlend filter primitive gives us image blending modes , like in many image manipulation programs .
These modes are screen , multiply , darken and lighten .
There 's a caveat , though : when blending an object against an semi- transparent background , the background will be accumulated twice , resulting in thicker objects under the bounding box of blended object .
This is a limitation of current version of SVG format , not a bug in Inkscape .
The feColorMatrix filter primitive applies a matrix transformation to colour of each rendered pixel .
This allows for effects like turning object to grayscale , modifying colour saturation and changing colour hue .
The feComposite filter primitive composites two images using one of the Porter - Duff blending modes ( described in paper Compositing Digital Images by T. Porter and T. Duff , published in SIGGRAPH ' 84 Conference Proceedings , Association for Computing Machinery , Volume 18 , Number 3 , July 1984 ) or the aritmetic mode described in SVG standard .
Porter - Duff blending modes are essentially logical operations between the images .
For example , xor mode shows the areas , where either one of the objects is , but not the areas where both of the objects are .
Arithmetic mode lets you specify coefficients k1 - k4 for blending equation ( result colour ) = k1 * ( first input colour ) * ( second input colour ) + k2 * ( first input colour ) + k3 * ( second input colour ) + k4 .
The feConvolveMatrix lets you specify a Convolution to be applied on the image .
Common effects created using convolution matrices are blur , sharpening , embossing and edge detection .
There 's a fairly good explanation and some example matrices at www.gamedev.net/reference/programming/features/imageproc/page2.asp.
Note that while gaussian blur can be created using this filter primitive , the special gaussian blur primitive is faster and resolution - independent .
Filter primitives feDiffuseLighting and feSpecularLighting create lighting maps for the object in input image .
SVG does n't have concept of third dimension , so these filters use alpha channel of input image as a height map : the more opaque given point in input image is , the nearer spectator it is considered to be .
There exists an example for using these in Inkscape distribution , in share / examples/lighting_effects.svg or in SVN
The feDisplacementMap filter primitive displaces the pixels in the first input using the second input as a displacement map , that shows from how far the pixel should come from .
Classical examples are whirl and pinch effects , that can be found in most image manipulation programs and even in some screensavers , where this kind off effect is moving around screen , twisting desktop beneath it .
The feFlood filter primitive fills its region with a given color and opacity .
It can be used as an auxiliary tool , usualy in combination with other filter primitives , in order to facilitate some common color handling operations .
The feImage filter primitive allows using external images as part of filtering chain .
For example , one could use external image as a displacement map for feDisplacementMap or as a height map for lighting effects .
Note that while SVG standard allows using other parts of the SVG file in this filter primitive , the current Inkscape implementation only allows external images .
The feMerge filter primitive composites several temporary images inside the filter primitive to a single image .
It uses normal alpha compositing for this .
This is equivalent to using several feBlend primitives in ' normal ' mode or several feComposite primitives in ' over ' - mode .
The feMorphology filter primitive provides erode and dilate effects , that are common in image manipulation programs .
With erode , darker and more transparent areas spread to lighter and more opaque areas , whereas with dilate lighter and more opaque areas spread to darker and more transparent areas .
For single - colour objects , this basically means , erode makes the object thinner and dilate makes it thicker .
The feOffset filter primitive offsets the image by an user - defined amount .
For example , this is useful for drop shadows , where the shadow is in a slightly different position than the actual object .
The feTurbulence filter primitive renders Perlin noise .
This kind of noise is useful in simulating several nature phenomena like clouds , fire and smoke and in generating complex textures like marble or granite .

Filters UI
New dialog for creating and modifying filter effects ( Object > Filter Effects ... )
)
The list at the left of the dialog displays all filters currently in the document .
New filters can be added with the Add button beneath the list Right - clicking a filter for the pop - up menu allows duplicating or removing a filter .
Double - clicking a filter will apply it to all selected objects A black dot is placed next to whatever filter is applied to the selected objects .
If more than one filter is in use by selected objects , an unfilled dot is used instead .
The second list , at the left of the dialog , displays the filter primitives that are contained within the currently - selected filter .
New primitives can be added by selecting the primitive type from the combo box beneath the list , and then pressing the Add button .
Right - clicking a primitive for the pop -up menu allows duplicating or removing a primitive .
Primitives can be rearranged by clicking and dragging any filter in the list .
When a filter is selected , the Settings group at the bottom of the dialog will change to display the attributes available for that primitive .
Changing a setting results in an immediate update to the document .
The " in " and " in2 " attributes for filters that support them are not shown in the Settings group .
These input connections are displayed graphically in the list , under the Connections column .
Inputs for a particular filter are displayed as triangles .
Depending on the primitive type , there may be one or two inputs ( or more for Merge primitives . )
Connections can be created by clicking on a triangle and dragging .
There are six standard input types that can be used for any primitive input ; Source Graphic , Source Alpha , Background Image , Background Alpha , Fill Paint , and Stroke Paint .
These are displayed vertically on the far right of the list .
Click and drag from an input triangle to one of the standard inputs to connect them .
Primitives can also be connected to other primitives by clicking an input triangle and dragging upwards to another primitive .
A primitive can only be connected to one higher up the list .
Single - clicking on an input triangle will unset it , returning it to the default .
If it is on a Merge primitive , the input will be deleted .
Merge inputs have an empty input at the end .
Dragging a connection from this input will add a new input to the primitive .
that are contained within the currently - selected filter .
Live Path Effects ( LPE )
Live path effects ( not to be confused with extension effects or SVG filters ) are a new way to non-destructively modify path and shape objects .
Path effects affect the path data of an object but not its style .
The original path is preserved and can be edited directly on - canvas , and the path effect applied to it will be updated live .
In this version , we include several path effects that are analogous to the corresponding extension effects ( such as Path along Path effect and Pattern along Path that replaces the extension of the same name ) .
The most important advantage of path effects is that they are , indeed , live - you can still edit the original path and the effect will update in real time ( unlike the extension effects which were one - time one - way transformations ) .
In the future , we plan to reimplement most if not all of path - changing extensions as live path effects .
Live path effects were developed by Johan Engelen as part of the GSoC 2007 .
Details about operation
The following schematic tries to explain how LPE work .
original style ------------> output style original path --> LPE --> output path ^ | parameters
The original style and path are from the path that the effect is applied on .
The output is what is visible on screen .
What is very important to notice is that output style equals original style .
The parameters can be paths , numbers , points , text , in principle anything .
Applying effects
Path effects are applied through the Path Effects dialog ( opened from the Path menu , or by pressing Ctrl + Shift + 7 .
This dialog is also used for controlling the effect 's parameters and for removing effects .
When a path with a path effect applied is selected , the statusbar description mentions that , for example " Path ( 4 nodes , path effect ) " .
There is a special Paste Path Effect command ( Ctrl+7 ) that can be used to copy effects from one path to another .
Editing effect parameters
When switching to the node edit tool ( F2 ) , the original path can be edited .
The original path is shown as a red helper path .
Normal path operations , like simplify , still work .
Some parameters of effects can be edited on - canvas .
For example , path parameters can be node - edited , by pressing the " edit on - canvas " button in the Path Effects dialog .
Press " 7 " to cycle through the different on - canvas editable parameters .
This way , one can edit the parameters without opening the Path Effects dialog .
The statusbar tells the name of the parameters that is currently being shown .
Available effects
Path along path
The Path along Path effect can curve a path along another path .
When this effect is applied to a path , it can be bend along another path ( called bend path ) .
With the node edit tool , both the original path and the bend path can be changed on - canvas and the result is updated live .
This provides a direct equivalent of " vector brushes " or " skeletal strokes " features in other vector editors .
In the effect 's control panel in the Path Effects dialog , you can select how many copies of the original path are put along the bend path ( either single or repeated ) and whether it is stretched to fill the bend path .
In this dialog you 'll also find a button to edit the bend path on - canvas and a button to paste a new bend path from clipboard .
A possible workflow is this : you select and copy the new bend path to the clipboard , then select the path you want to bend , apply the Path along path effect , and paste the bend path with the paste button next to ' bend path ' .
Example file : live - path - effects-pathalongpath.svg
Pattern along path
The Pattern along Path effect can curve a path along another path .
When this effect is applied to path A ( called skeleton ) , another path B ( called pattern ) can then be passed as a parameter .
The result is that path B is bent along path A .
With the node edit tool , path A can be changed on - canvas and the result is updated live .
This provides a direct equivalent of " vector brushes " or " skeletal strokes " features in other vector editors .
In the effect 's control panel in the Path Effects dialog , you can select how many copies of the pattern are attached ( either single or repeated ) and whether the pattern is stretched to fill the skeleton path .
You can also choose the pattern for the selected skeleton [ either directly or ] by pasting it from clipboard ( that is , you select and copy to the clipboard the pattern , then select the skeleton , apply the Path along path effect , and paste the pattern ) .
The Scale width parameter allows you to change the width of the pattern applied to the path .
Example file : live - path - effects-pathalongpath.svg
Stitch Subcurves
The Stitch Subcurves effect connects points from two subpaths of the path with straight line or curved segments , i.e. the stitches .
It looks a lot like the Effect Lines from Expression 3 .
The result is also referred to as " String Art " .
For some examples of string art , see http://members.shaw.ca/jillbritton/string_art/jbstringart.htm.
The shape of the connecting paths can controlled by the stroke path parameter .
This could be used to draw ' hair - shaped ' connecting paths with sharp end - tips .
Other controls include the number of paths , the variation in spacing between the connecting paths ( clustering ) and also whether the start and end points of the stitches should like exactly on the original subcurves or can stray randomly around them .
Finally the width of the stroke path can be varied .
Note that this effect can only be applied to a path with two subpaths in it , hence ' subcurve ' in the name .
Use Path >
Combine to create such a path from two separate paths .
Example file : live - path - effects-curvestitch.svg
Gears
The Gears effect is a toy effect .
It generates a chain of interconnected gears from the path that has the effect applied to it .
The nodes of the path define the centers of the gears .
The first 3 nodes are special ; the first defines the start angle of the chain , the second defines the center of the first gear and the third knot specifies the radius of the first gear .
That is , to create a chain of 2 gears , you will need a path with 4 nodes ; for 3 gears , 5 nodes , and so on .
Example file : live - path - effects - gears.svg
Development of new effects
One of the goals of the Summer of Code project was to make it easy to create new effects .
There is a framework that greatly simplifies effect implementation ; very little code is needed to get the effect hooked into Inkscape .
This leaves valuable time for the actual effect to be implemented .
See the http://wiki.inkscape.org/wiki/index.php/MakingLivePathEffects wiki page for an explanation of how to get started with your own effect !
Extension effects
Live preview
Live preview of effects :
Using the async behavior ( see below ) , as soon as the parameters dialog for an effect is shown , the script is executed in the background and the screen updates as soon as it's finished .
This can result is seemingly faster execution if no parameters are changed .
If some parameters are adjusted , the script is restarted .
This allows you to see immediately the effects of any parameter change without pressing the OK button on the effect 's dialog .
Spawn Glib API : Scripting extension have been moved to the Glib spawn API to ensure that parameters and variables are n't interpreted by a shell .
This also means that scripting extensions are executed in a separate process asynchronously allowing the GTK main loop to continue to execute .
Progress dialog :
While an extension is working on a document , a small dialog is shown allowing the user to cancel the execution .
New and improved effects
The new Modify Path >
Edge 3D extension creates black , grey and white paths around a shape , then blurs and clips them for a 3D effect .
The new Generate from Path >
Dimensions extension creates CAD style dimensions that are basically arrows with lengths equal to selection 's bounding box and captions representing length .
The new Render > Barcode extension creates a barcode .
Supported types include EAN13 , EAN8 , UPC-A , UPC-E , UPC - 5 , Code39 , Code39 Ext , Code93 , Code128 , and RM4SCC .
The new Render >
Gear extension creates a mechanical gear given the number of teeth , the circular pitch ( in px units ) , and the pressure angle .
The new Render >
Spirograph extension creates intricate mathematical curves akin to the classic mechanical Spirograph toy ( see samples ) .
A group of new effects in the Text submenu performs various case conversions on selected text objects : converting to UPPERCASE , lowercase , Sentence case , Title Case , as well as flipping case ( switching uppercase to lowercase and vice versa ) and rANdoMiZInG cAse .
If no texts are selected , the effect works on all texts in the document .
Another effect in the Text submenu , Replace text , performs search - and - replace on the selected text objects or ( if nothing is selected ) on all texts in the document .
Searching is case sensitive .
You can use this effect to globally delete all occurrences of some text fragment by replacing it with empty string .
Conversely , if you search for an empty string and replace it with some string , this string will be inserted after every character of your text ; for example , you can space out a text by replacing in it an empty string with a single space .
A new effect , Replace color in the Color submenu , simply replaces one RRGGBB - specified color to another within selection or , if there 's no selection , in the entire document .
As with other effects in that submenu , the replacement affects fill , stroke , and gradient colors , but not colors of bitmaps .
The new Color >
Randomize extension allows you to change the color via hue , saturation and lightness check boxes .
This is useful if you want to colorize lots of shapes at the same time .
The Whirl extension uses the center of view as the center of whirl , so you do n't have to enter the center coordinates numerically .
The Render >
Grid extension has got an extended range of grid spacings , from 0.1 to 1000 px .
The Render > Function Plotter extension can now plot using polar coordinates .
The Generate Template > Perfect - Bound Cover extension creates templates for wraparound covers for perfect - bound books using US size and paper weight measurements .
This extension will resize the document to include the width , height , spine width , and bleed measurements that are provided to the extensions , so it should be the first operation done before designing .
XSLT effects
XSLT is now supported for input , output and effect extensions .
This is used to support the XAML file format ( both import and export ) and the Adobe Illustrator SVG import which removes Adobe 's stuff from SVG .
ImageMagick effects
New raster operations available through the effects drop - down menu , powered by the ImageMagick library .
For any of these effects to work , you need to have an image object selected in the drawing .
Adaptive Threshold applies adaptive thresholding to the bitmap .
Average color of rectangle provided by width and height used as threshold value .
Use offset to apply a different threshold than the average .
Add Noise adds random noise of certain types to the bitmap .
Blur blurs the bitmap , using radius as the amount of blur .
Higher radius means more blur .
( Note that unlike the vector Gaussian blur of objects , this bitmap blur will not extend the edges of the image , so it may appear truncated at the edges . )
Channel extracts the specified channel from the bitmap .
Charcoal applies a charcoal drawing style to a bitmap .
Radius controls the width ( or detail ) of charcoal strokes .
Higher radius means lower detail .
Sigma : the higher it is , the less defined the charcoal is .
Colorize overlays the bitmap with a given color at a given intensity .
Contrast lightly enhances the contrast ( difference between lights and darks ) of a bitmap .
Cycle Colormap cycles the colormap of a bitmap .
Despeckle reduce the speckle noise in a bitmap .
Edge hilights edges in a bitmap .
Emboss embosses a bitmap , hilighting edges with 3D effect .
Enhance enhance a bitmap , minimizing noise .
Equalize equalizes a bitmap .
Histogram equalization .
Flop mirrors a bitmap , reflecting each scanline in the horizontal direction .
Gaussian Blur blurs a bitmap , more strongly than regular blur .
Implode sucks everything towards the center of the bitmap .
Level scales values falling between the given Black Point to White Point range to the full color range .
Level Channel acts the same way as level but for only one channel .
Median Filter filters a a bitmap by replacing each pixel component with the median color in a circular neighborhood
Modulate adjusts the percent hue , saturation , and brightness of a bitmap .
Negate takes the inverse of a bitmap .
Normalize normalizes a bitmap , expanding color range to the full possible range of color .
Oil Paint stylizes a bitmap so that it appears to be painted with oils .
Opacity modifies the opacity channel of a bitmap .
Raise alters the lightness of the edges of a bitmap to create a raised appearance , much like a frame .
Reduce Noise reduces noise in a bitmap by using a noise peak elimination filter .
Shade shades a bitmap by simulating a distant light source
Sharpen sharpens a bitmap .
Solarize solarizes a bitmap , like overexposing photographic film .
Spread randomly spread pixels in a bitmap within the radius of amount .
Swirl swirls the bitmap around the center point .
Threshold thresholds a bitmap .
Unsharpmask sharpens a bitmap using an unsharp mask algorithm .
Wave alters a bitmap along the sine wave .
These effects are part of the Google Summer of Code 2007 , coded by Christopher Brown .
Misc
All Python effects are switched from the old and unmaintained PyXML library to the new powerful lxml library .
A new parameter , precision is added to the parameter definitions in the inx file format , allowing you to set the number of digits in that parameter 's spinbutton in the effect UI .
Stock patterns
Since a few versions ago , Inkscape supports patterns in fill and stroke .
However , up to now the only way to apply a pattern was by creating it in the document using the Object ( s ) to Pattern command , which was n't very convenient .
Now , if you switch an object 's fill or stroke to pattern using the Fill & Stroke dialog , you will get a drop - down list with a number of predefined stock patterns that you can apply simply by selecting them from the list :
A selection of plain stripes differing by the ratio of the stripe width to gap width ( for example , the " Stripes 1:2 " pattern has gaps twice as wide as stripes ) , in the range from 4:1 to 1:64 .
All stripes patterns are in two versions : with black stripes and with white stripes ( gaps are always transparent ) .
Two checkerboard patterns with black and white odd squares ( even squares are transparent )
Packed circles : a hexagonal pattern of black circles with transparent gaps .
Polka dots : a scattering of dots designed to look randomly but evenly distributed so as to mask the regularity of the repeating pattern .
There are three size variants of this pattern ( small , medium , and large dots ) and two color variants ( black and white dots ) .
Wavy is a pattern of wavy lines .
Camouflage is a green - toned protective pattern such as that used by the military .
Ermine is the traditional heraldic pattern representing stylized stoat furs with black tails .
Three bitmap patterns : sand , cloth , and old paint are based on seamless photographic tiles and allow you to add some natural texture to your drawing .
All of them are grayscale , so you can make objects with these textures semitransparent and overlay them over other colored objects to " texturize " them .
After applying a stock pattern , switch to Node tool to edit the location , scale , and rotation of the pattern via on - canvas handles .
All stock patterns are stored in the file patterns / patterns.svg in Inkscape 's share directory ( typically /usr / share / inkscape on Linux , inkscape - dir / share on Windows ) .
You can add your own patterns to this file or replace it with any other SVG file containing the patterns you need .
Markers
A new command , Objects to Marker , was added to the Object menu .
It converts the current selection into a marker .
After you do it , the selection is deleted , but the list of markers in the Fill and Stroke dialog , Stroke style tab , now contains the new marker that you can apply to paths .
When creating the new marker , Inkscape assumes that the original objects are oriented as they should be on a horizontal path that goes from left to right .
For example , if you create a new arrowhead that you plan to use as an end marker , make it point horizontally to the right before converting it to marker .
Similar to standard markers , the user - created marker will scale up and down as you change the stroke width .
Its initial size ( i.e. the size of the object that you have turned into a marker ) corresponds to the 1 px stroke .
When you create a new marker , Inkscape uses the rotation center of the ( first ) selected object as the anchor point , i.e. the point which will coincide with the node to which that marker is attached .
By default , the rotation center is in the center of the object 's bounding box , which means the newly created marker will be centered around its node .
If you move the rotation center , for example , to one of the corners of the object , the new marker will touch its node by that corner .
Several new UML markers were added to the standard set , including filled and hollow diamonds and triangles .
Master opacity did not apply to path markers as it should ; this is fixed .
Stock markers , if used in the document , now appear in the " this document 's markers " section at the top of the marker lists in the Fill & Stroke dialog .
Before , any markers with stock IDs ( including markers modified by the user ) were hidden , making it difficult to work with modified stock markers .
Color management
Calibrated SVG color including CMYK
Inkscape now supports color - managed color definitions that use a colorspace other than sRGB ( for example Adobe RGB , or calibrated CMYK colors ) .
In the SVG file , this is done using the optional " icc-color ( ... ) " paint components as described in section 11.2 " Specifying paint " of the SVG 1.1 specification [ 3 ] .
A fallback sRGB value will be used , for non color - managed workflows .
This allows for the use of calibrated color spaces , including using CMYK values that are preserved across applications .
The new CMS color selector tab allows these colors to be edited .
Display adjustment
In Inkscape Preferences , Color Management tab , there 's are new options for enabling display adjustment ; you can select any calibration profile ( an ICC file ) suitable for your display .
Options for rendering intent can also be chosen .
Per -window adjustment
Display adjustment is enabled and disabled per each editing window .
This allows for simultaneous viewing of adjusted and unadjusted views of a single document by using multiple windows .
There is a toggle at the bottom - right corner of the scrollbars that allows for turning on and off display adjustment .
It also will be disabled to provide visible feedback when no profile is set to be available for adjustment .
XICC Support
On X11 - based systems ( i.e. Unix and Mac OSX ) , use of [ ICC Profiles In X Specification ] ( or XICC ) can be enabled .
Support for version 0.2 of this specification has been implemented .
Enabling this option by choosing to retrieve profiles from the display will switch Inkscape to using profiles attached to screens at runtime .
These allow display adjustment to be changed on the fly , and to be set and cleared per-monitor .
This is especially helpful with more than a single monitor .
Other Open Source software such as GIMP support XICC .
This allows all aware applications to be adjusted by setting a profile only once .
Multi-monitor aware
When XICC support is enabled , windows will adjust to the proper profile as they are moved across monitors .
Also , as the windows are moved onto monitors with no profile attached , the adjustment toggle will become disabled .
When the windows are moved onto screens that do have profiles , the toggle will become enabled .
Soft Proofing
In Inkscape Preferences , Color Management tab , there 's a new option for enabling output device preview ; you can select any calibration profile ( an ICC file ) suitable for your output device .
Options for rendering intent can also be chosen , along with out of gamut warnings .
OS support
Сolor management is supported in Linux and Mac OS X only at this time .
Grids , guides , snapping
Grids
Grids have undergone some big changes under - the - hood .
These are the visible changes :
There is a new 3D / axonometric grid .
It consists of three sets of parallel lines , one vertical and others at angles of +30 and - 30 degrees from the horizontal .
The angles of these two latter sets and the spacing of the grid are user - settable .
A new tab in the Document Properties dialog , Grids , is devoted solely to grids ; the former grid / guide tab is renamed Guides and is now used only for guides .
On the Grids page , you can create and manage grids of various types in your document ; so far the two types available are Rectangular ( default ) and Axonometric , but more types may be added in the future .
More than one grid can be active at the same time :
Each grid can be enabled / disabled separately from the Document Properties dialog .
For each grid , you can hide it by unchecking the " Visible " checkbox in the grid 's tab , or disable snapping to it by unchecking " Enabled " .
Note that you can have " Enabled " on and " Visible " off ( but not vice versa ) , in which case you snap to the invisible grid .
Multiple views on the same document ( i.e. different Inkscape windows with the same document loaded ) share the same grids , but the grid can be turned on and off for each view separately .
For example , you could have a zoomed - out " overview " view without grids showing .
Duplicate that window and zoom in on some detail ; then grids can be shown only for that view , and snapping will only happen in those views for which grids are enabled .
The rectangular grid now has an option to show dots on gridline intersections instead of solid lines .
From developer perspective :
Implementation of new grids is much easier now by subclassing CanvasGrid .
Have a peek at how the rectangular grid is implemented ( CanvasXYGrid ) .
Note that there is no longer " the grid " , there might be several grids active now !
Grid information is now stored in SVG as a child of sodipodi:namedview .
Old files will be converted to this new format automatically .
An old bug is fixed : apparently the origin of the document coordinate system used to be set to the origin of the grid .
For example , in 0.45.1 and before , specifying a grid origin of ( 20,20 ) moved the origin or coordinates to that point , and the grid was still starting at ( 0,0 ) in this moved coordinate system .
This is now disabled , and the coordinate origin is not affected by grid origin .
Angled guidelines
Now , Inkscape also provides angled guidelines !
Double click on a guide to set its angle .
When dragging a guideline off the rulers close to the end of the ruler , the guideline will automatically be angled .
The angle is set depending on the grid .
For the rectangular grid , the angle is 45 degrees .
For the axonometric grid , the angle is matched to the grid .
When Ctrl is pressed , the angle is perpendicular to the grid lines ( useful for aligning gradients ) .
Creating guidelines from objects
Selected objects can now be converted to guidelines .
To do this , either use the menu command " Object - > Object to guides " or press Shift + G in Selector tool ( this shortcut also works in some other tools , see below ) .
The conversion process recurses into groups , i.e. all objects in the current selection are converted regardless if they are grouped or not .
Created guides can be quickly deleted by Ctrl+clicking on them ( this is of course not restricted to guides created by the process described above ) .
Note that this only works in Selector and Node tools , i.e. , in contexts where guidelines can be manipulated with the mouse .
Paths are converted by creating one guide for each straight line segment occurring in the path ( whereas curved segments are not taken into account ) .
To make this conveniently accessible , the shortcut Shift + G works in Pen and Pencil tools , too .
For all other objects , conversion usually happens by placing the guidelines around the object 's bounding box ( use the corresponding checkbox in the " Tools " page of Inkscape Preferences to switch between geometric and visual bounding box ) .
For rectangles and 3D boxes there is a special option in their preferences pages ( checked by default ) which instead allows the guidelines to be placed along the object 's edges so that they imitate its true shape .
This is especially useful when converting rotated or skewed rectangles ( to create guidelines in a special position ) or for creating 3D scenes containing other objects than just boxes .
The shortcut Shift + G works in these tools as well .
Snapping
Snapping has been implemented or improved for :
Newly created shapes
Skewing of objects
Handles of objects , incl .
gradients
Images , ellipses , and clones
Text boxes , which snap to text baselines again
Objects , for which snapping now optionally considers the rotation center
Objects , which now allow for constrained snapping
Guides , which now snap while dragging them
Axonometric grids
Angled guide lines
Bounding boxes , of which now all four corners snap
Other snapping fixes and improvements include :
It is now possible to snap to intersections of e.g. gridlines with guidelines , and of line segments .
The snapping preferences dialog has been restyled to make it more intuitive .
Inkscape now has a global snapping toggle , which has been added to the view - menu and is accessible through a shortcut
Inkscape now allows for controlling the snapping per grid when multiple grids are being used
Snapping distance is now set in screen pixels and is therefore independent of zoom .
Snapping of objects has been made more clean , by only snapping bounding box corners to bounding boxes , and nodes to other nodes and paths .
The time it takes to snap to objects using the selector tool has been reduced significantly .
The bug where " node - to - node " snapping caused jerky movement of nodes is fixed .
The aspect ratio is correctly preserved while scaling objects with snapping turned on .
Only nodes at non -smooth parts of a path now snap .
The confusing " Default transformations origin " option has been removed .
Now Inkscape always uses the opposite edge of the object 's bounding box as the transformation origin ( though the bounding box itself can now be different , see next item ) .
A new preference option has been added to specify the kind of bounding box to be used for transforming objects ( see Inkscape Preferences , Tools , Selector ) .
You can choose between the visual bounding box ( which takes into account the stroke width , markers , and blur margins ; this is the default behavior ) or geometric bounding box ( which encloses only the path itself , disregarding stroke width ) .
Import / Export
PDF and AI import
In this version , Inkscape can natively ( i.e. without any additional software ) import PDF files and the newer PDF - based Adobe Illustrator files ( starting from AI version 9.0 ) .
Implemented features :
The new import extension can import paths , text , clippaths , masked or non-masked images , and softmasks .
It supports pattern fills ( XStep and YStep attributes are ignored ) as well as linear and radial gradients ( only those using sampled or exponential functions ) .
Gradient meshes are imported , but they get converted to groups of small tiles ( flat - colored paths ) that approximate the mesh ; the user can adjust the precision of this approximation .
PDF import settings :
After opening a PDF or AI document , the PDF Import Settings dialog shows up .
Here you can select :
the page to be imported from a multipage PDF ;
the overall clip region ( which can be none or set to any of the PDF boxes , e.g. the crop box , the media box , the trim box , etc. ) ;
the precision for the approximation of gradient meshes ; note that setting this too high may result in a huge SVG file and slow performance when importing files with gradient meshes ;
a checkbox controlling whether the images should be embedded into the resulting SVG document or saved on the current path ;
a preview of the selected page ( shown if poppler - cairo is present on the system or if the selected page has a thumbnail embedded into the PDF document ) .
Text editing tips :
Any text imported from PDF or AI has each letter 's precise place on the page fixed .
While this preserves the exact appearance ( e.g. justification of text blocks ) of the imported document , it makes editing such text difficult : deleting text fails to contract the text line and inserting text fails to expand it , i.e. typed letters overlay the existing letters .
( However , you still can replace a letter with another letter of about the same width , although you may need to kern it into place with Alt+arrows . )
To work around this , select the text object you want to edit and use Text >
Remove manual kerns command .
This will remove the exact positioning information , so if the text block was justified it will lose justification , but instead you will be able to edit it as usual .
Note that there is a way to select even a single line in a text block .
For this , open the XML editor , expand the < svg: text > tree branch corresponding to your text , and select any of the < svg:tspan > objects under it .
Now you can remove manual kerns from this line only .
After you finish editing the line , you can manually justify it back , for example by adding spaces , manual kerns ( Alt+arrows ) , or by adjusting letterspacing ( select the whole line and use Alt + > or Alt +<) .
The native PDF / AI importer is based on the poppler library and was implemented by Miklós Erdélyi as part of the Google Summer of Code 2007 .
PDF export
A new cairo - based PDF exporter has been added to Inkscape ( marked as " Cairo PDF " in the export format list ) .
Inkscape 0.46 can export shapes , strokes , transparency , gradients , patterns , text , and images correctly to cairo .
Clipping paths and masks are known to be faulty or missing .
Also , unlike the old PDF exporter , the cairo - based PDF export produces compressed PDF files that are reasonably compact .
cairo will write a PDF with vector graphics when possible and fall back to raster graphics when needed .
What can be exported as vectors and how much of the image will be rasterized when the fallback kicks in depends on your version of cairo .
cairo version 1.2 with the pdf backend compiled in is the minimum requirement for any cairo - based PDF exports , but it is highly recommended to use at least cairo 1.5.2 for quality PDF export .
A new cairo - based PostScript exporter has been added ( marked as " Cairo PS " in the export format list ) .
The cairo PS backend is not as mature as the PDF backend .
It rasterizes a lot of its content .
Text output does not work where it works with the PDF backend .
CDR ( CorelDraw ) import
Inkscape can use UniConvertor if it 's installed on your system to import documents in CDR format ( CorelDraw ) .
This feature is Unix - only at this time and requires that you have Python and UniConvertor installed .
As of UniConvertor 1.1.1 , versions from 7 to X4 of the CDR format are supported , and text objects are not converted .
XAML import / export
Inkscape can import vector graphics portions of XAML documents , as well as export its documents to XAML .
Adobe Illustrator SVG clean import
Using this new import filter , Inkscape can open an SVG document removing any elements and attributes in the namespaces that Adobe Illustrator uses for its stuff .
This will clean out everything except the actual SVG content .
WMF import
Now Inkscape uses UniConvertor for opening WMF files , which results in three noticable changes :
imported files are editable now known rendering issues are resolved WMF import works on all platforms where UniConvertor works ( including Windows )
Text objects are not supported by UniConvertor as of version 1.1.1 .
Bitmap export
Batch export : The Bitmap Export dialog ( Ctrl + Shift + E ) got a new checkbox , Batch export all selected objects .
This checkbox is available when two or more objects are selected .
If it is checked , instead of exporting selection as a whole , Inkscape exports each selected object separately into its own PNG file .
This uses each object 's export hints ( i.e. export filename and DPI ) if they are remembered from a previous export ; otherwise , the filename is created from the object ID and the DPI is 90 pixels per inch .
Caution : Unlike regular export , batch export overwrites all existing PNG files without warning .
This makes it possible to implement all kinds of image slicing and automated export scenarios .
For example , if you are working on a web site design , you can create a separate " export " layer .
In that layer , " slice " your web page image into separate areas by creating invisible rectangles with no fill and no stroke .
Select each rectangle ( by Tab / Shift + Tab , or by switching to Outline mode where even an invisible rectangle can be selected by clicking on its outline ) and export it into the corresponding filename ( which gets saved as that object 's export hint ) .
After that , if you do any changes to your graphics , it 's very easy to reexport all the slices : just switch to the " export " layer , select all in that layer ( Ctrl+A ) , and export with the Batch export selected objects checkbox on .
Hide all except selected : A new checkbox allows you to hide in the exported image everything except selected object (s ) .
The Export dialog automatically appends the .png extension to the export filename you specify .
Open Clip Art Library import and export
Inkscape features a preliminary support for importing drawings from Open Clip Art Library .
After specifying account details in Preferences dialog ( Import / Export tab ) use ' File > Import From Open Clip Art Library ' command to open a dialog , then search for tags and pick one of the results to merge this found drawing into your document .
Command line
Several new command line options are added that make Inkscape even more scriptable and automatable than before .
-- verb - list will list all the Verb IDs and their names in Inkscape .
This makes writing your own menus and hotkeys much easier as you can easily find out what the choices are .
-- verb followed by a verb ID allows you to specify a verb to be called on every document opened by Inkscape initially from the command line .
-- select followed by a node ID will allow you to add a node to the list of selected objects .
-- query - all produces a comma delimited listing of all objects in the document , with their x , y , height , and width values .
These options can be used , for example , for performance testing .
You could do something like this :
$ time inkscape --verb=FileClose my_complex_file.svg
to measure the time it takes to load and display the file .
Of course , with the ability to select objects , it can be much more useful than that .
You can call extension effects , or any other verb , then FileSave and FileClose to automate all kinds of operations on your drawings .
User interface
Dockable dialogs
Inkscape 's dialog handling has been reworked in this release to allow dialogs to behave like dockable panels .
The dock area that holds the user 's dialogs is located right of the canvas .
Dialogs placed in the dock can easily be rearranged , resized , stacked in groups or iconified .
Furthermore , a dialog can be dragged of the dock to become a floating dock in itself — this allows other dialogs to be dragged and dropped on it to form a floating group of dialogs .
The old dialog behavior ( used in releases before 0.46 ) has been preserved as an option , and if it is preferred , one can select it under Windows >
Dialog behavior in the Inkscape preferences dialog .
Known issues
Some of Inkscape 's dialogs are yet to be adapted to allow docking , these include the " Text and Font " dialog , the " Tiled clones " dialog , the " XML editor " and the " Object properties " dialog .
Floating dialogs that are closed and later reopened might reappear on positions slightly different than their original ones .
Resizing dialogs that are placed in the dock can be a bit slow and quirky .
The total height of content the dock will in most cases remain the same when a dialog is closed / iconified , i.e. the remaining docked dialogs will fill the hole .
This might not the desired behavior .
Settings
Three settings that control dockable dialogs behavior are present in the preferences.xml file under a options group called dock :
cancenterdock : controls if dialogs are allowed to be stacked on top of each other to be ordered in groups .
Valid values are " 0 " and " 1 " .
dockbarstyle : controls what information is shown for iconified dockable dialogs .
" 0 " = icons only , " 1 " = text only , " 2 " = both icons and text .
switcherstyle : controls what information is shown for grouped dockable dialogs .
" 0 " = icons only , " 1 " = text only , " 2 " = both icons and text .
Toolbars
Main toolbar on the left can now optionally use smaller buttons .
With the several new tools added in this version , this may help users with small screens where the toolbar otherwise may not fit vertically .
The toggle is on the Misc tab of the Inkscape Preferences dialog .
Switching to stock GTK + toolbars .
This allows for the main window to be made narrower , with toolbar items flowing into a popup menu as it is resized .
Swatches panel , color drag - and - drop
Right - clicking a color swatch now opens a context menu which allows you to apply the color to the fill or stroke of selection .
Dragging colors from the color palette has been fixed and improved :
Now the dropped color is applied to the object on which you drop it , regardless of whether that object is selected or not .
This means you can change the color of only one object from selection without having to select it separately .
( If you want to assign color to the entire selection , just click on the color swatch on the palette , not drag it . )
If an object has stroke and you drop the color over stroke , the color is applied to stroke and not fill .
( Another way to always apply color to stroke is to Shift + drag it . )
When gradient handles are active ( e.g. in Gradient or Node tools ) , you can drop a color onto the gradient line to create a new gradient mid stop with this color , or drop a color onto an existing stop to recolor that stop .
A new submenu has been added to affect the shape of the displayed swatches , allowing their preferred size to be made thinner or wider .
Among other things , this allows for more to be seen on screen at once when made thinner .
Sizing of the swatches has been corrected to be properly progressive , and now go form smaller to larger on all platforms .
Space reserved for the scrollbar is no longer kept with smaller palettes shown in the bottom of the main UI .
This allows for more working space when palettes with not many entries are selected at smaller sizes .
Color gestures
A new method for quick and precise adjustment of colors is added in this version : color gestures .
It works on the selected objects by grabbing the fill or stroke color swatch in the selected style indicator ( on the left of the statusbar ) and dragging it in various directions as described below .
Note that this only works when the swatch displays a flat color ; it does not work for a swatch showing " None " , " N/A " , or displaying a gradient ( although you can select one or more gradient stops in Gradient tool and color - adjust them by color gestures just as you would do for objects ) .
Color gestures can work on fill or stroke , depending on which swatch in the selected color indicator you drag .
Color gestures work in HSL color space .
Dragging without any keyboard modifiers adjusts the hue channel , dragging with Shift adjusts saturation , and dragging with Ctrl adjusts lightness .
The adjustment is done by " rotating " the color swatch away from the original direction which is assumed to be NE at 45 degrees ( i.e. from the swatch diagonally into the document window ) .
Once you click and drag the color swatch , imagine a diagonal line going from the point where you clicked in the NE direction , across the entire Inkscape window .
By dragging below or to the right of that line , you decrease the corresponding color channel , to the minimum at the lower edge of the window ; by dragging it above or to the left , you increase it , to the maximum at the left edge of the window .
If you hover your mouse exactly over the 45 degrees line , the change will be zero .
Note that you can easily vary the precision of your adjustment .
If you drag close enough to the swatch , each small movement results in a big change of the color .
If you need a finer adjustment , just drag farther away from the swatch , towards the center of the Inkscape window or even to its upper right corner , where minute movements will produce very small changes in the color .
In fact , this method gives you more color precision than even the color wheel in the Fill and Stroke dialog , unless you expand that dialog to fill the entire screen which is rarely practical .
The mouse cursor changes when you 're doing color gestures , reflecting the channel currently adjusted and indicating the directions for increasing and decreasing the value .
Also , watch the statusbar which will indicate , as you drag , the channel you are adjusting , the original value of that channel , the new value , and the difference .
You can switch channels while you drag .
That is , you do n't need to drag it again and again from the swatch if you want to adjust all three channels - you can do it all in one drag , by pressing and releasing Ctrl and Shift as necessary .
Note that when you change the keyboard modifiers during drag , the position of the zero - change line is temporarily changed to go through the current mouse position ; this is done so that there are no sudden changes in color if you are switching modifiers away from the original 45 - degree line .
The Alt modifier is special .
Pressing
Alt means " do nothing " ; this allows you to move the mouse , without releasing , to a more convenient place from where to continue tweaking the color after letting go of Alt .
As with the other modifiers , releasing
Alt temporarily redefines the zero - change axis to go through the point where Alt was released .
For example , imagine you made your color darker by Ctrl +dragging towards the bottom edge of the window and you now need to make it less saturated .
You cannot however Shift + drag it any lower because there 's just not enough room for that .
In that situation , without releasing the mouse , Alt+drag it upwards to a convenient spot and then Shift + drag downwards as needed .
Also , you can start dragging from the swatch with Alt pressed to avoid changing the color while you take a more
Israel wants the US government to know that it wo n't implement laws banning the circumvention of DRM and it wo n't rewrite its ISP safe harbor rules ; furthermore , neither of these issues should have any effect on trade relations between the two countries .
The Israeli filing ( PDF ) made to the US Trade Representative comes a month after the International Intellectual Property Alliance called out numerous countries around the world for not living up to the IIPA 's vision of the ideal copyright enforcement regime .
Canada came in for a thorough trouncing , and Israel was also subject to criticism that it was n't doing enough on copyright .
The IIPA 's comments were made as part of its " Special 301 " report to the US Trade Representative .
Private groups like the IIPA submit reports to the US government , which eventually decides whether to place other countries on watch lists or apply trade penalties .
Israel has no intention of remaining on its current watch list , and the filing has an irritated tone to it .
The reason for the irritation is that Israel thinks it has done plenty to help copyright owners .
In 2007 , it overhauled its copyright law , increasing the maximum statutory damages that can be collected for infringement five - fold .
In addition , Israel added a " making available " right and clarified that a copyright owners ' right of reproduction includes even temporary copies .
But the IIPA wanted more .
Specifically , it wanted to see rules surrounding DRM and a safe harbor law that is friendlier to content owners .
As Israel points out , though , it is not a signatory to the two WIPO treaties that mention DRM , and it notes that even content owners have different approaches to the issue .
" The critiques and criticism of TPM [ technological protection measures ] both from business model perspectives and from copyright perspectives are almost endless , " says the Israeli response .
" Indeed , some content providers are already experimenting with nonencrypted access to content .
Hence , the question of whether and in what manner to implement TPM is not straightforward and politically volatile . "
When it comes to ISP safe harbors , Israel has a notice and takedown system that lets copyright owners notify an ISP regarding infringing material on its servers .
In such cases , the user hosting the material has three days to respond to the charge ; if no response is received , the material comes down .
The IIPA wants a system more like the DMCA where just filing a takedown notice is enough to have material removed ( in the US system , a counternotice can be filed by the host to have the material put back up ) .
Israel objects that it is under no obligation to implement such a system , and notes that it chose the current arrangement for a reason .
" A ' takedown ' system which operates on the basis of a mere allegation of infringement would be an invitation to censorship and abuse of process , " it says in the filing .
" It is not the role of the ISP or Host to become a policeman of content .
Requiring such would effectively bring the Internet to a halt . "
Despite the " usual inaccuracies and hyperbole , " Israel does welcome one recommendation from the IIPA report : bumping Israel from the Priority Watch List to the Watch List .
Canadian law professor Michael Geist wishes that his own government would respond this forcefully to the Special 301 process .
The New York Times has done a lot in its online division , in terms of offering content for free , leaning towards more supplemental income from advertising , and integrating with social networks like Facebook in order to further engage segmented audiences .
Nevertheless , after years of fighting the printed industry trend and even a recent hiring freeze , The New York Times will be eliminating about 100 newsroom jobs over the course of this year , according to an article in The New York Times today .
Considering some of the staff cuts we 've seen from others that participate in online markets in recent months , like AOL , Yahoo , EMI and iVillage , the percentage of those that will be eliminated from The New York Times is relatively small , given that The Times has over 1,300 employees that work in the newsroom .
And as all companies look to do , The Times will try to avoid layoffs by not refilling positions that have become vacant , and by offering buyouts to others .
Regardless of these efforts , layoffs are probably the inevitable ending to this particular chapter for The New York Times .
What makes this particularly difficult for The Times is the paper 's necessity to compete in a struggling market .
The examples given by the cited article in The New York Times today outlines the strain of dealing with The Wall Street Journal , which is ramping up its efforts to compete directly with The Times , as well as the expensive coverage of the war in Iraq and the ongoing presidential elections .
What one would gather from reading this article in The New York Times is that the newspaper company is finding a hard time lowering its operational costs , which would be a necessity to fully adapt to the changing distribution and advertising methods found in the online sector .
I 'll be the first to admit that shifting gears , from printed to digital , and then onto free , is no easy task , and there are a lot of growing pains .
The Times will need to continue to change a lot within the company structure in order to remain the longstanding powerhouse it is .
As Murdoch had been mulling over making The Wall Street Journal free online , it has been clear for a few months now that he'd been taking cues from The Times ' experience when making his decision to keep The Journal a subscription - based service .
