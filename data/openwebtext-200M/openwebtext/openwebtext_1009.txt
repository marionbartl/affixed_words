There 's a really good discussion over at Drawger right now , over Gary Taxali 's flipping off at wannabe - clients who ask illustrators to work for insulting fees , or for free !
Go read it , because it's an absolutely wonderful display of a creative community coming together to support each other and offer advice , but here 's the gist of Gary 's anger :
Gee , Google sure has been hit by some hard times !
I had no idea .
I 'll have to make sure I use their services more , maybe click on some ads .
Help them get back thoseIn an effort to somehow get by , Google has been forced to ask a great number of commercial illustrators for free work .
It 's the only way !
The mean and unreasonable Melinda Beck thoughtlessly send back this reply to such a request : Really .
Google .
And although I 'm sure you 've either already read the discussion or shall do right after this , I 'm going to post this short quote from William Self I think the advice coming from everyone here is important not only to illustrators or artists in general , but also of course to businesses big and small , and just to people in general .
EDIT : Brian Stauffer has done some fantastic illustrations for Google
DETROIT ( Reuters ) - General Motors Corp on Tuesday took a step toward restructuring its widely criticized board by naming former AT&T Inc CEO Ed Whitacre to become chairman of the reorganized automaker when it emerges from bankruptcy under U.S. government oversight .
Whitacre , an engineer by training who guided Texas - based Southwestern Bell through a decade of transformative mergers , will take over as chairman when a new GM is launched out of bankruptcy , the company said .
GM , which filed for bankruptcy on June 1 , plans a quick sale process that would allow a much smaller automaker to emerge from court protection in as little as 60 days under the majority ownership of the U.S. Treasury .
By picking Whitacre as chairman for the new GM , the White House - appointed autos task force took the first step toward establishing a restructured board to oversee the government ’s $ 50 billion investment in reshaping an American industrial icon .
“ He is coming into an industry that is accustomed to heavy regulations .
He knows how to grow a company .
He gives a lot of credibility to GM ’s restructuring , ” said Stephen Spivey , an auto analyst with Frost & Sullivan .
Former GM Chairman and Chief Executive Rick Wagoner , who had staked his reputation on keeping the company out of bankruptcy , was ousted by the Obama administration at the end of March .
In announcing Whitacre ’s selection , GM also confirmed that the longest - serving board members and those most closely associated with Wagoner ’s tenure would be leaving .
Kent Kresa , former chief executive of Northrop Grumman Corp who has been serving as GM ’s interim chairman , will stay on in that position until Whitacre takes over , GM said .
Whitacre and Kresa , along with current board members Philip Laskawy , Kathryn Marinello , Erroll Davis Jr , E. Neville Isdell and Chief Executive Officer Fritz Henderson , will serve as the “ nucleus ” of the restructured board , GM said in a statement .
GM ’s board has come under fire before as efforts to restructure and turnaround a long - running slide in its business faltered .
In the late 1980s , Texas tycoon Ross Perot dubbed his fellow GM directors “ pet rocks ” who sat silently by then - CEO Roger Smith .
In 2006 , Jerry York , a director representing billionaire investor Kirk Kerkorian , resigned from the GM board and said that directors were unwilling to challenge Wagoner .
York had urged GM without success to drop unprofitable brands such as Saab and Hummer , steps that it only took later as its financial crisis deepened .
Three of the GM outside directors staying on at the reorganized company -- Marinello , former chief executive of Ceridian Corp ; Davis , a former chief executive of Alliant Energy Corp , and Isdell , a former chief executive at Coca - Cola Co -- joined the board after that dispute .
Davis and Marinello joined in 2007 .
Isdell joined in 2008 .
Laskawy , former chief executive of Ernst & Young LLP , joined the GM board in 2003 .
Other board members with more than a decade of experience were expected to retire in the coming weeks , GM said .
That includes George Fisher , a former Eastman Kodak chief executive , who had been a steady ally of GM management under Wagoner .
GM has retained executive search firm Spencer Stuart to find four more directors to serve on the board of the new GM .
Those directors will be approved by the U.S. government .
The Canadian government and the United Auto Workers union will each nominate a single director .
That will bring the total number of directors of the reorganized company to 13 .
GM currently has 12 board members .
KNOWN DEALMAKER
Whitacre , 67 , retired from AT&T in 2007 after seeing the largest U.S. telecommunications service provider through seven large acquisitions over a decade .
The Texas - born executive was the telecommunications industry ’s best - known dealmaker during a period of rapid consolidation in the late 1990s that remade Southwestern Bell into a national provider of services ranging from cell phones to cable television under the AT&T brand .
Kresa said Whitacre ’s track record had appealed strongly to U.S. officials overseeing the government ’s investment in GM led by former investment banker Steve Rattner .
Other board appointees will have similar experience in leading companies through turnarounds or turbulence , said Kresa .
“ We are looking at candidates that have been involved in companies where there has been a dramatic change in the marketplace , ” Kresa told reporters in a conference call .
“ Those are the qualities that we ’re looking for -- and I believe have found , ” he said .
The U.S. Treasury was “ the ultimate decider ” in the decision to appoint Whitacre as chairman , Kresa said .
A small group of candidates were considered for the role but Whitacre had been under consideration from late March , he said .
Compensation for GM board members will be “ restored to a more normal level of pay ” once the company emerges from bankruptcy , Kresa said .
GM board members , who had previously received $ 200,000 per year , have been working for $ 1 per year since the company took U.S. government loans late last year .
Obama administration officials have said they intend for the government to leave key operational decisions to GM ’s management once the new board is in place .

The Kansas abortion clinic run by the doctor who was shot to death in church last month has closed permanently , his family said on Tuesday .
The clinic of Dr. George R. Tiller , in Wichita , had been one of a few in the country to provide abortions to women late in their pregnancies , and for decades , women had traveled there from all over the nation and overseas .
The office , Women ’s Health Care Services Inc. , was also the state ’s only remaining clinic , even for abortions performed early in pregnancy , outside the Kansas City area .
“ Notice is being given today to all concerned that the Tiller family is ceasing operation of the clinic and any involvement by family members in any other similar clinic , ” a statement issued by Dr. Tiller ’s lawyers read .
The lawyers said the Tiller family would offer no additional comments .
After Dr. Tiller was killed as he served as an usher at his church on May 31 , national abortion rights advocates had hoped , they said , that others might step in and keep his clinic open to provide late - term abortions .
Many of these advocates expressed empathy on Tuesday for the decision of the Tiller family , which had been the target of criticism , protest and attacks for more than 30 years , but they also said the loss of the clinic might prove devastating to families of those few women who learned late in pregnancy of catastrophic health issues .
Until last month , the strongest evidence in drug and drunk driving cases in courtrooms across the nation often was a piece of paper .
A crime lab or Breathalyzer report would confirm that the defendant indeed had illegal drugs or a high level of alcohol in his or her system .
But a Supreme Court decision has sent a jolt through that procedure .
Now the prosecution must make a lab technician available to testify in person if the defendant demands it .
As a result , some cases already have been dismissed .
One state , Virginia , has called a special legislative session to change its laws .
And some lawyers think the ruling will continue to have a major effect .
In a 5 - 4 decision , the high court said that lab reports served as “ witnesses ” for the prosecution .
And because the 6th Amendment gives defendants a right to “ be confronted with the witnesses against him , ” Justice Antonin Scalia said that drug defendants and others were “ entitled to be confronted with the [ lab ] analysts at trial . ”

While Scalia said the decision upheld the basic right to question the prosecution ’s witnesses , the four dissenters said the ruling had “ vast potential to disrupt ” the criminal courts .
They also said it gave “ a great windfall ” to defendants , some of whom could have their cases dismissed because a lab technician was not available to testify .
Some prosecutors have said they fear the uncertainty -- and the potential cost -- of being required to have lab technicians ready to testify .
“ This is a train wreck in the making , ” said Scott Burns , executive director of the National District Attorneys Assn .
“ The court is saying you ca n’t submit an affidavit saying that the cocaine is cocaine .
The criminalist must be there to testify the cocaine is cocaine .
Particularly in rural states and in smaller communities , this is going to be a major problem . ”
In Virginia , several judges in the last month have dismissed drunk driving charges against motorists because technicians were not in court to testify about how a Breathalyzer was calibrated .
Gov. Tim Kaine has called the Legislature into a one - day special session to pass a bill , similar to laws in dozens of states , that will put defendants and their lawyers on notice before a trial that a lab report will be submitted as evidence .
The defense lawyer then would have a duty to tell prosecutors whether a lab tech must be there to testify .

The court ’s decision also raised questions .
For example , is the required witness the lab technician who ran an evidence sample through a machine , or the expert who programmed or calibrated the machine ?
It is also not clear what happens in cases in which the lab expert is not available .
“ What are you supposed to do if your ballistic expert moved from Cleveland to Phoenix prior to the trial ? ” Burns said .
“ We are particularly concerned about prosecuting cold cases , ” said Lael Rubin , a deputy district attorney in Los Angeles , because the lab experts who worked on old crimes may no longer be available .
She said the decision could force the retesting of old samples , assuming they can be tested .
Perhaps the biggest question is how many defendants will take advantage of this new right .
More than 9 in 10 drug cases end in a plea bargain , not a trial before a jury .

Stanford law professor Jeffrey L. Fisher , who won the case before the high court , said states such as California routinely bring crime experts to trials .
Other states require prosecutors and defense lawyers to agree in advance what kinds of evidence will be submitted .
“ It may take a little while , but people will figure this out , ” Fisher said .
Some defense lawyers predicted the effect of the ruling would be minimal .
“ It will be the rare case where this comes into play , ” said Steve Benjamin , a criminal defense lawyer in Richmond , Va .
“ It will be unusual for a defense lawyer to insist on live testimony .
All you are doing in those situations is emphasizing the evidence that incriminates your client . ”
He and other defense lawyers , however , emphasized that crime labs had made mistakes that had sent the innocent to prison .
For example , reports on hair samples and bite marks have been shown to be exaggerated or false .
In some cases , they said , it is crucial to question a crime lab expert to expose doubts about the evidence .
Advertisement
And the high court may not be finished with the issue .
On the last day before the summer recess , the justices voted to hear a Virginia case to decide whether the prosecutor or the defense lawyer had the duty to call a lab expert as a witness .
It was a curious move , since a 5 - 4 majority had ruled just days before that the prosecutor had a duty , if asked , to present live testimony from a lab technician .
But that majority included now - retired Justice David H. Souter , leaving open the possibility that a new justice -- Sonia Sotomayor , if she is confirmed -- could tilt the court in a different direction .

There can be little doubt that the provision of an effective and free service for BitTorrent anonymity would prove hugely popular .
Today we bring you a detailed report on BitBlinder - a brand new open source project which promises to cloak your torrents , hide your browsing and get round many obstructive filters .
A question which regularly pops up in the TorrentFreak mailbox is “ How do hide myself online ?
How can I get free anonymous BitTorrent ? ”
Our answer is usually something along the lines of “ Free anonymous BitTorrent is n’t really a reality right now .
You could use TOR but please , please do n’t .
It ’s slow and really , the people who run TOR do not want it flooded with torrent traffic .
Your best option is to use a VPN service , but this will cost you a few bucks . ”
Maybe , just maybe , in future our answers will be different .
Allow us to introduce BitBlinder , a new and free cross-platform ( Mac support coming soon ) open source project which not only claims to make anonymous BitTorrent transfers a reality but also hides your IP address while browsing the web .
Its functionality also extends to the bypassing of some web filters and in the future will be compatible with more applications , such as email , IRC and instant messaging clients .
Although anonymity with the previously - mentioned TOR is good , using it for torrents is a big no – it ’s too slow and the operators of the network do not appreciate it .
BitBlinder was born to solve the problems that TOR could n’t .
TorrentFreak caught up with Josh Albrecht , one of the creators of BitBlinder , for the lowdown .
“ BitBlinder is an attempt to address the aforementioned issues with Tor – we want to make online anonymity fast , usable , and ubiquitous to the point that organizations give up on spying and filtering us , ” Josh told Torrent Freak .
“ BitBlinder is actually built on much of the same technology as Tor , though we have a completely separate network . ”
The anonymity itself is provided by BitBlinder ’s own P2P network , inside which everyone is required to contribute their own bandwidth to proxy other users ’ data .
The diagram below shows a standard user setup , without anonymity ;
As seen in the diagram below , your request for data using BitBlinder is passed encrypted through multiple peers .
Each peer in the chain only knows the IP address of the next person in the chain , not the original requester / sender .
Since decent BitTorrent - capable anonymity services cost money these days , how can BitBlinder offer the same for free ?
The key is to think of it as operating a little like a private BitTorrent tracker .
In order to maintain a good ratio on a private tracker , at a minimum you need to upload the same amount of data as you downloaded .
With BitBlinder there is a similar system – in order to get the service for free you have to proxy X GB of data for other people inside the swarm if you want to share X GB of anonymized data .
In common with some new accounts on private trackers , BitBlinder accounts come pre-loaded with some free credit to get the user going – 2 GB to be precise .
If anyone prefers not to be bound by ratio rules in the future , just like on many private trackers it will also be possible to buy ‘ upload credit ’ to use BitBlinder , but there is no reason why people ca n’t use it for free , as long as they share their bandwidth as detailed above .
At this point some readers will be asking how it ’s possible for no - one to know what ’s going on inside the BitBlinder swarm , yet somehow BitBlinder manages anonymity ratio tracking .
It is possible though , and for those interested to learn about the micro-payment system BitBlinder ’s is based on , further ( highly technical ) reading can be found here ( pdf ) .
Of course , since traffic is sent from your PC to others in the BitBlinder swarm before reaching its destination in order to anonymize it , it wo n’t be as quick as regular non-anonymous BitTorrent use , but Josh told us speeds should be respectable and in any event , much faster than TOR .
Indeed , within a few seconds of starting a ‘ Steal This Film ’ torrent from The Pirate Bay , we experienced speeds in excess of 2 M bit/s , which is massively faster than my previous experiences of BitTorrent over TOR .
For Windows users the BitBlinder package comes in a 17 mb installer .
The torrent client is a custom version of BitTornado and although it does n’t have all the features of say uTorrent , more features will be added as time goes by .
The bundled anonymous browser is naturally built on Firefox .
Josh told us that the BitBlinder network could be made to work with uTorrent or another browser such as Internet Explorer but unfortunately both applications are closed source , which means that it ’s impossible to be certain that all data will be sent through other users ( proxies ) in the BitBlinder swarm and not directly to the Internet .
For the same reasons , Flash is unavailable in the bundled version of Firefox .
Another trick up BitBlinder ’s sleeve is the development of techniques to bypass web filters .
“ BitTorrent encryption is pretty good at avoiding ISP level restrictions but it does n’t do much for things like avoiding university or corporate firewalls .
One of Tor ’s goals is to circumvent the Great Firewall of China and we hope to make BitBlinder even better , ” explained Josh .
“ Filters generally work by either blocking ports , a certain IP address , or by inspecting the traffic itself for specific protocols .
We ’re working hard to make BitBlinder effective against all three of these methods , but we still have some work to do on these features , so results may vary . ”
Since BitBlinder has an anonymous browser , it should prove useful if you do n’t want your employer knowing what you ’re doing on Facebook or other social networks , for example .
Indeed , if these sites are blocked it ’s possible to use the BitBlinder network to access them .
Of course , the anonymity would also be useful for signing up to and using the HTTP element of a torrent site .
Inevitably there are some issues with an anonymity system such as BitBlinder , and they parallel those experienced by users of TOR .
Any traffic generated inside the BitBlinder network eventually needs to escape to the wider Internet .
In order to facilitate this , some users need to act as an exit point .
In basic terms , this means that an exit node operator ’s IP address will be associated with the traffic leaving the network .
Before panic sets in , this is not necessarily bad news .
Acting as an exit node provides the operator with plausible deniability , since they will have no idea what data is passing through .
It would also be difficult to say if the data leaving that PC had originated from there or elsewhere , extending the deniability of their own traffic too .
And it ’s not as if that user ’s IP address was n’t perfectly visible already before BitBlinder came along .
For most users , however , opting to act as a beginning or middle proxy in the BitBlinder network means that no - one outside can see any traffic emanating from their PC and the good news is that this internal traffic still adds upload / download credit to the user ’s account .
Time will tell if BitBlinder lives up to its dreams ( and everyone else ’s ) but from what we ’ve seen so far in the beta version , things are looking very promising indeed .
That said , remember folks this is a beta and it is likely people will uncover bugs so please be patient and consider allowing the app to send crash reports , it will help the team a lot .
BitBlinder can be downloaded here – do n’t forget to register and please read the instructions on how to forward ports etc , it will be good for your ratio .
New users should note that invite codes will be sent out at a controlled rate .
Early adopters will be able to register fairly quickly but as more and more people apply , the longer the wait will become .
This is merely to ensure a healthy network with an adequate number of quality proxies .

Renault has been suspended from the European Grand Prix for the events that led to a wheel coming off Fernando Alonso 's car in Hungary today .
Following a post - race discussion with the stewards , it was deemed that the team had breached the regulations enough for it to be suspended from the next event .
It means Alonso will miss his home event that takes place in Valencia next month , unless he moves to another team .
Alonso had been leading the race up until his stop , but his efforts came to nothing after his right front wheel was not fitted properly .
It worked its way loose and flew off the car later that lap , ending up against the crash barriers .
A statement issued by the stewards on Sunday night said that there had been multiple breaches of the regulations by the Renault team .
Stewards talked to Renault representatives twice after the race .
The statement said that Renault " knowingly released car no .
7 from the pitstop position without one of the retaining devices for the wheel - nuts being securely in position , this being an indication that the wheel itself may not have been properly secured . "
It added that Renault , " being aware of this , failed to take any action to prevent the car from leaving the pitlane .... failed to inform the driver of this problem or to advise him to take appropriate action given the circumstances , even though the driver contacted the team by radio believing he had a puncture . "
It said that the team 's actions had compromised safety in breach of Article 3.2 of the Sporting Regulations , and in breach of Article 23.1. i had released the car from the pits before it was safe to do so .
Renault has been reminded of its right to appeal the decision .

" Linux Gazette ... making
Linux just a little more fun ! "
Installing Linux on a Sun SPARC Ultra 5 By Bruce Forsberg
B eing an open - source software developer , I naturally perform all my work on the Linux operating system .
Anyone who does development knows the advantage of having ALL the source code available .
As an example , I work on a project called the ( Open Source Audio Library Project ) .
It is a C++ class library that contains audio functionality .
While doing development on my Linux laptop I was having problems with some audio sample rates .
At some sample rates the audio would sound like Donald Duck and at others it would be normal .
The same test would work fine on my desktop Linux machine .
After extensive investigation it was determined that when I exited another operating system and booted into Linux without powering down the laptop a register on the audio chip would not get reset and would cause this problem .
I found the driver in the audio code and inserted the fix into the driver and it worked .
I sent the patch to Alan Cox who put it into the very next kernel release ( 2.2.17 ) .
If this was a problem with a proprietary OS the likelihood of this ever being fixed would be slim .
As part of my testing for my library I saw the need for three things , 1 ) to be able to support more OS's , 2 ) to be able to support big-endian CPU's , 3 ) and to support 64 bit computing platforms .
After looking at other computers available , I determined that a computer from Sun Microsystems would be a good addition .
Sun makes the most popular commercial UNIX computers and their new models use the UltraSPARC CPU's which are big-endian and 64 bits .
Sun has an entry - level computer available called the Ultra 5 .
A new computer would cost $ 2000 - $ 3000 .
This was more than I wanted to pay .
So I searched Ebay and found a used Ultra 5 .
Used Ultra 5's now sell on Ebay for about $ 500 - $ 700 .
A good deal for another workstation .
I bought the Ultra 5 containing a 270 Mhz UltraSPARC II processor , 64MB of memory and a 4.3 GB hard drive .
If you are undecided about what kind of Sun workstation to get , then check out the SPARC - HOWTO at www.linuxdoc.org.
I also purchased Solaris 8 for $ 75 from Sun ( www.sun.com/software/solaris/binaries/get.html) and installed it .
Installation went perfectly .
I was able to port my software to Solaris .
But knowing that some people run Linux on SPARC 's meant that I needed to install Linux on the Ultra 5 as well , preferably in a dual boot configuration with Solaris 8 and Linux .
The following is my experience with installing Linux on my Ultra 5 .
Step 1 - Selecting the distribution
The first step was to determine which distribution to use .
Having used Linux for several years on Intel processors , I have used SuSE many times and liked it .
When I found that SuSE had a SPARC distribution I decided on this .
So I headed over to CheapBytes , and 3 days later I had my CD's .
If you are undecided about what distribution to use then check out the www.ultralinux.org web site .
They have a list of currently supported Linux distributions for Sun workstations .
Step 2 - Planning the installation
The next step was to determine where to put the Linux distribution .
I only had a 4.3GB hard drive installed , hardly enough to contain both Solaris and Linux .
First I decided that since I had never installed Linux on SPARC I would remove the existing 4.3 GB IDE hard drive and install an old 3GB IDE hard drive to use as a test install drive .
This drive came from an old Linux on Intel system .
When I did this I ran into nothing but problems .
Using SuSE 's installer called YaST2 , I was unable to partition this hard drive no matter what I did .
YaST2 gives you two options , an automatic option , and a custom manual option .
When using the automatic option and telling it to use the whole hard drive just returned errors that it was unable to partition the drive .
Everything that I tried with the manual mode did not work either .
Finally after a couple of days of trying , I decided to install Solaris on the drive first thinking that maybe the drive needs to be formatted in some way .
This seemed to work .
When I ran YaST2 after this and using the custom manual partitioning menu I left the SunOS Swap partition and then created a 16MB / boot partition , a 2GB / partition , and a 200 MB Linux swap partition .
After this the installation of the files went smooth .
I found out later by surfing the Internet that when one uses a non-Solaris disk one needs to run the fdisk utility and create a Solaris disk label on the disk .
It also went on to say that this label is stored in the first partition on that hard drive so the first partition can't be a Linux swap partition since it will not reserve space for this label .
Now I was ready to install the real thing .
I decided to start over completely .
So I purchased a new 20 GB hard drive and installed it into the Ultra 5 .
Next I powered up the Ultra 5 and during initialization pressed the Stop - A key sequence .
This takes you to the boot PROM on the Ultra 5 .
I placed the install Solaris 8 CD in the CD - ROM drive and entered " boot cdrom " and away went the Solaris installation .
When the install looked for the hard disk it could not find any space .
Since this is not the Solaris Gazette , suffice it to say that it put me at a command prompt and I had to enter format and create a backup label on the third partition ( # 2 ) and zero out all the others and label this to the hard drive .
After this I restarted the Solaris 8 install and it went fine .
For the Solaris install I created a root partition of 5GB with a 512 MB Solaris swap partition and a 2GB / export / home partition .
Now I started the Linux install .
I installed the first SuSE CD and rebooted the computer .
When the boot started I did the Stop - A thing and typed " boot cdrom " .
I let YaST2 run and selected manual partition editing .
I created a 512MB Linux swap partition , a 16 MB / boot partition , and the rest of the drive as the Linux / partition .
Step 3 - Installing the Linux software
The next step is to actually install the linux software .
I selected the packages I wanted and then was presented with the SILO configuration .
I selected the custom SILO configuration and verified that Install SILO on partition / boot was selected .
I did this rather the the MBR ( Master Boot Record ) since I will use OpenBoot in the PROM to select whether to boot Linux or Solaris .
More on this later .
By installing SILO in / boot I will be able to test different Linux kernels and boot to them .
I then created a user account and entered a password for the root user .
Then off went the installer installing the software , a total of 1624 packages .
Everything went fine with the install .
After the install finished , I used YaST to setup the rest of the stuff one does after a Linux install .
I selected the Sun Happy Meal 10 /100 base T interface for the network .
The rest of the network sets up just like a Linux on Intel system .
I then configured audio for the Ultra 5 by following the steps in the manual on the first CD - ROM .
I added the following two lines to the file in /etc/ init.d/boot.local :
modprobe audio modprobe cs4231
The only problem here is that the manual said the file was in / sbin not /etc .
For an experienced Linux installer this was an obvious mistake in the manual but a novice might have some problem with this .
I reported this to SuSE and they responded promptly , thanking me for the correction .
When I tried to run my audio application , the open call on the audio device / dev/ audio just hung and never returned .
After some investigation I found that KDE had an audio server running that was using the device .
I went to the KDE control panel and turned off this audio server and restarted KDE , and now I have working audio on my Ultra 5 .
Next I mounted the Solaris 8 disk partitions on Linux so that I could see them .
The partition type that Solaris uses is called ufs .
I read notes also that write capability is experimental .
So I mounted both / and / home partitions from Solaris in Linux by performing the following .
I performed " fdisk / dev/hda " to list the partitions that I have on my first hard drive .
It turns out that I have / dev/hd a1 as / and / dev/hda8 as /home .
First I created mount points .
I like points under / , so I did :
cd / mkdir sun_root mkdir sun_home
Next I added to /etc / fstab the following lines : / dev/hda1 / sun_root ufs defaults , ro , ufstype=sun 1 0 / dev/hda8 / sun_home ufs defaults , ro , ufstype=sun 1 0
Now I mounted the mount points " mount / sun_root " and " mount / sun_home " .
Now I can see my Solaris partitions from Linux .
Step 4 - Configuring Dual Boot
The next step is to set up booting between the two operating systems on the Ultra 5 .
Most of you are familiar with LILO on your Linux on Intel machine .
For Linux on Solaris you will find SILO .
I use SILO to boot different Linux kernels , but to boot between Solaris and Linux I use the boot PROM on the Ultra 5 called OpenBoot .
The following instructions will apply to the 3.x version of OpenBoot , which should exist on all Ultra 5's .
To get to the OpenBoot prompt you need to press the Stop - A key sequence .
Once you are at this prompt you can type devalias , this will list all of the aliases that are defined .
You should see several disk entries like :
disk / pci@1f,0/ pci@1,1/ide@3/disk@0,0 disk3 / pci@1f,0/pci@1,1/ide@3/disk@3,0 disk2 / pci@1f,0/pci@1,1/ide@3/disk@2,0 disk1 / pci@1f,0/pci@1,1/ide@3/disk@1,0 disk0 / pci@1f,0/pci@1,1/ide@3/disk@0,0
All of the stuff on the right is a device entry .
You can now create several aliases of your own .
I created two , linux and solaris :
linux / pci@1f,0 / pci@1,1/ide@3/disk@0,0:d solaris / pci@1f,0/ pci@1,1/ide@3/disk@0,0:a
These are the device entries for disk0 which would be hard drive / dev/hda in a Linux on Intel box .
The : letter at the right of the device entry points to the partition on that hard drive .
So to boot the first partition it would be :a .
To boot the forth partition you would use :d at the end .
To store these entries in non-volatile ram you need to create the above entries with the nvalias command in OpenBoot .
Note that if there is an alias with the entry on the right it will be replaced with the new alias .
There is another parameter that you can set in OpenBoot and it is :
setenv auto - boot ?
= false
This will make the computer stop at the ok prompt when powered on .
This allows one to then select which OS to boot , solaris or linux .
All one has to type is either " boot solaris " or " boot linux " .
Step 5 - Miscellaneous
Notes
The following are some miscellaneous notes I discovered dealing with Linux on SPARC .
1 . If you see the following messages " Unimplemented SPARC system call 69 / 44 " from your kernel while booting then ignore them .
System call 44 and system call 69 are getuid32( ) / geteuid32 ( ) both are not necessary on UltraSPARC .
2 . Apparently , from what I have read , for Linux on UltraSPARC , the kernel is 64 bits but userland is still at 32 bits .
I am not to sure what this means , but I think it means that I will not be able to compile my application as a 64 bit application .
3 . The Stop - A key sequence is disabled on SuSE 7.1 and some others distributions .
In SuSE it can be enabled in YaST2 by going to the misc section .
I tried to enable it and when I did Stop - A the computer hung and I saw no boot prompt .
So , it is probably a good idea to leave it disabled when in Linux .
Conclusion
I 'm by no means an expert gadget reviewer like the guys at Engadget or Gizmodo , but I did pay for my own device ( with your donations ) , unlike Leo ( just kidding Leo ) .
I 've never used an iPhone ( last mention of that device in this review unlike all the other reviews ) .
Plus , I make a lot of stuff up , so this review should be a lot more fun .
If you want to read my account of how I acquired the device with my cyborg wife that account is in the BBlog .
First step after unboxing was to download the Web OS update .
The Pre informed me that it needed at least 30 % battery power before it could install it , so I set up the Touchstone inductive charger .
Yes , it 's overpriced at $ 70 for about $ 5 in parts .
Yes , the technology is n't new .
The geek factor makes it worth it though .
It does have some practical implications though too .
Since connecting the Pre to my computer to sync with iTunes , I have n't had to pry off the plastic cover of the USB port or reach for a cable .
Bonus Tip :
If you reverse the polarity on the inductive charger , you can create a stream of tachyons , so you never miss a call now or in the future .
Hardware :
All charged up and updated , now for some first impressions on the hardware .
The screen is very nice .
Sharp , clear , brilliant .
Resolution is 320 x 480 .
The Pre feels good in the hand .
Nice weight and shape .
Slider mechanism works well , feels good .
Little more wiggle than I 'd like , but nothing worrying .
The bottom edge of the keyboard needs to be softened .
It 's not " dangerous " like Gizmodo claims , but I might take some sandpaper or something to it later .
When closed there is one button on the front of the display that puts the system in card view so you can flip between applications .
There 's a 3.5 mm headphone jack on top of the unit , volume toggles on the left and a power button on the upper corner .
The USB port resides on the right side .
Pretty bare .
On the back is the speaker , camera lens and flash .
The camera is a rear - facing 3 MP camera with LED flash .
I took this picture of Mrs. BBspot in a dark club .
I thought it came out well for a low - light camera phone picture .
( click images for full versions )
Here 's an outoor shot in full sunlight .
Here 's a shot taken indoors .
Not a replacement for a DSLR , but would do in a pinch .
Of course , sending the pictures from the phone is a breeze .
The Pre comes with 8 GB of storage space with about 7 GB usable .
I connected the Pre with the USB cable to my computer .
It asks if you want to charge , storage mode , or media mode .
Media mode lets you sync with iTunes .
I pared down my music collection to about 1000 songs and loaded them onto the Pre. 4 GB of music still leaves me quite a bit of space for apps .
It would be nice to have a card slot for more storage .
I 'll have to see how quickly the device fills up with apps and images .
Hopefully that will not become a big issue .
The keyboard .
One thing that sets the Pre apart from other smartphones is the vertical slider keyboard .
I saw some complaints in other reviews that it was too small , but I did n't have any issues with it .
I 'm sure with time most people can get used to it , I took to it right away .
Phone quality .
I 've talked with Mrs. BBspot cell phone to cell phone .
She says the quality is excellent .
My voice sounds clear .
No issues there .
You can set your MP3 files as ringtones on a per contact basis .
I wonder if I should set The Imperial March for Mrs. BBspot .
Maybe not .
Software : Entered my Facebook , Google and AIM accounts and the Pre downloaded all the info from them .
It merged the contacts that it could , and I only had to link the AIM contacts that did n't have full names to their respective contacts .
I had accumulated quite a few Google contacts through the years .
It 's much easier to edit in bulk on the computer at google .com / contacts than on the Pre itself .
When finished , I just hit the Sync Account button and all the changes I made online appeared on the device .
Most excellent .
There are n't many apps available yet for the Pre .
As of this writing there were 25 apps in the store .
So far I 've installed Tweed ( a Twitter client ) , Sudoku , Fandango , Sporting News Pro Baseball , Accuweather , Speedbrain ( game ) Sprint TV is included with the plan .
You can watch full episodes of shows from ABC , NBC , CBS , Sci-Fi and others .
You can stream NFL Network and Disney Channel .
Apps load quickly and easily .
I did notice that the baseball app slowed things down after I left it open for a while .
Probably something screwy with that app .
I 've had five or six apps open at a time with no noticeable change in performance .
The Pre also comes with GPS navigation for free .
With Google Maps GPS and the Internet at my fingertips , I better never get lost .
If I do , I still have my Swiss Army Knife .
Web browsing is slick .
The pinch zoom function works well .
Web sites render great .
The Sprint network where I live ( Ann Arbor , MI ) is nice and speedy .
Having a wifi connection helps too .

To my knowledge I have n't contracted any communicable diseases since buying the phone .
Also my cancer has gone into remission , lost 20 pounds and grown some hair back ( not back hair ) .
Push Gmail works great .
I get email on my phone before it shows up in my browser .
Problems , wish list .
After a few days of use there has n't been anything that 's made me even consider taking the phone back to the store .
There are some items that would make help round the device out for me though .
Needs a gmail app for better integration with Gmail .
A Facebook app would be great too .
Keyboard shortcuts , threading and archiving ( hack for archiving though ) do n't work .
I 'm sure Google will have something soon .
It would be nice to have a simple solitaire game on here .
Conclusions :
This is a solid device that 's great out of the box , and has a lot of potential for growth .
Sprint has improved its service the past year ( and they 're cheaper overall ) , so if you have good coverage from them in your area , you might want to check this phone out .
If you have any questions about the phone or would like me to try anything out with it please let me know .

In October 1995 , Likud Party leader Benjamin Netanyahu appeared before thousands of right - wing demonstrators in Jerusalem 's Zion Square to deliver a stinging denunciation of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and the Oslo Accords he had signed two years earlier .
" Death to Rabin ! Nazis ! Judenrat ! " the demonstrators chanted .
Many waved signs depicting Rabin dressed in Nazi regalia .
Concerned that Netanyahu would inflame an already dangerous climate , Israeli Housing Minister Benjamin Ben-Eliezer warned the hyper-ambitious politician , " You 'd better restrain your people .
Otherwise it will end in murder .
They tried to kill me just now ...
Your people are mad .
If someone is murdered , the blood will be on your hands ...
The settlers have gone crazy , and someone will be murdered here , if not today , then in another week or another month ! "
Netanyahu ignored Ben-Eliezer , striding to the podium to chants of " Bibi ! Bibi ! Bibi ! " and an eerily prescient introduction as Israel 's " next prime minister . "
One month later , Rabin was assassinated by Yigal Amir , a right - wing radical and student at Bar - Ilan University , the ideological training ground of Israel 's religious - nationalist front .
Rabin's wife , Leah , refused to forgive Netanyahu , insisting he was at least as responsible for her husband 's murder as the extremist who pulled the trigger .
With Netanyahu back in the prime minister 's office , Avigdor Lieberman 's proto - fascist party in control of several top government posts , and the Israeli peace camp Rabin once inspired in a state of near - permanent marginalization , an emboldened settler movement has turned its wrath on Barack Obama .
Obama has aroused the setters ' ire by calling for a construction freeze in the West Bank and a halt to Israeli housing projects intended to Judaize Palestinian neighborhoods in East Jerusalem .
7 - 23 , an anti-US hatefest erupts in front of the American consulate in Jerusalem
On July 23 , thousands of Jewish settlers and their right - wing allies in the Knesset gathered in front of the American consulate in Jerusalem for a torchlight rally against Obama 's proposals .
My friends Joseph Dana and Mairav Zonszein were there with a video camera to document the demonstrators ' histrionics .
According to Dana , no other journalists shot video of the event .
" Saddam Hussein Obama ! Saddam Hussein Obama ! " the settlers chanted .
" Piss off , you little shit ! " a young radical growled when asked if he had a message for the American president .
" I believe if Barack Obama manages to hurt Israel they will be punished , " said another twenty - something rightist .
" At some point Israel will survive and America will fall . "
The most remarkable comment came from a demonstrator who claimed that White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel , a former civilian volunteer for the Israeli army and the son of a former member of the Zionist terrorist group Irgun , is a self - hating Jew .
Emanuel " is an auto - anti - Semite , " the protester said .
" He is a Jew that has something against his Jewishness . "
In another era , it might have been possible to dismiss such a remark as paranoia from the far - right fringe .
Unfortunately , Netanyahu is reported to have said the very same thing in private discussions with his top advisers .
According to Ha'aretz correspondent Barak Ravid , the Israeli Prime Minister has routinely referred to Emanuel and David Axelrod as " self - hating Jews . "
Like the settlers whose rhetoric he apparently emulates , Netanyahu has become unhinged by Obama 's interference with Israel 's ongoing colonization of the West Bank .
Obama 's special envoy to the Middle East , George Mitchell , will hold several meetings this week with top members of Netanyahu 's government .
Seeking to tamp down on the growing rancor between Tel Aviv and Washington , Mitchell called the meetings " discussions between friends . "
But who are the Israeli Prime Minister 's real friends ?
The settlers who cheered Rabin 's murder and now inveigh violently against Obama , or the American administration that has pledged to ship his country advanced weaponry and billions in loan guarantees ?
The White House must force Netanyahu to decide .

Some of the hottest hot - shot pilots in space opera are women .
It 's a longstanding tradition in science fiction to show women taking the controls of starships , space fighters and star - cruisers , and here are our favorite badass female cockpit jockeys .
Advertisement
Even as more women are becoming astronauts and getting to pilot the space shuttle , science fiction has shown tons of women taking the helm .
Here are some of the most awesome , in no particular order :

Lady Sharrow in Against A Dark Background by Iain M. Banks
We do n't get to see combat specialist Sharrow doing that much piloting in this book — but when she does take the controls , she makes it count .
The one sequence where she does some fancy flying is one of the best moments in the book .
Carolyn Fry from Pitch Black .
I do n't know how I managed to forget her — I actually had her on my list , and had grabbed this cool pic of her in advance .
She manages to bring a dead ship down in spite of incredible odds — and sure , she tries to jettison her passengers .
But she 's just being sensible , after all .
Advertisement
Sue Parsons from Virtuality
As with Sharrow , Sue Parsons spends most of her screen time doing other things — mostly , like all the other characters on this show , bickering and freaking out about virtual reality nightmares .
But when she does actually get to handle the Starship Phaeton 's controls — watch out .
She does an incredibly complex series of maneuvers while giant bombs are going off in her wake .
Makes all the drama totally worth it .
Advertisement
Jenna , from Blake 's 7 .
This smuggler is the best pilot around — there 's no competition , except maybe that arrogant twerp Del Tarrant .
Jenna manages to take the controls of the Liberator , the most super - advanced ship in space , and master them almost immediately .
And she 's able to take it on manual and do some fancy flying , on occasion .
Advertisement
Saint - Emxin from Battle Beyond The Stars .
She 's a mean Valkyrie fighter pilot , who more than holds her own in the movie 's crucial Star Wars - inspired firefights .
Han Solo not only could n't pull off her headgear , he also could n't outfly her .
( I almost included Padme Amidala in this list , since she pilots a ship in Attack Of The Clones — but could Amidala really hold her own against Saint - Exmin ?
I think not . )
Advertisement
Tak from Invader Zim .
The " hideous new girl " shows up hoping to do a better job of invading Earth than Zim , and she has the ability to hypnotize humans into doing her bidding — but she also pilots her own ship .
Advertisement
Faye from Cowboy Bebop
Faye is an awesome fighter pilot , and even held her own in a dogfight with Spike .
Runner - up status also goes to space trucker V.T. , aka Victoria Terpsichore .
Advertisement
Carol " Foe Hammer " Rawley in Halo .
She does some pretty nifty flying as the pilot of Pelican transport Echo 419 on the UNSC Pillar of Autumn .
She specializes in doing lots of missions involving hostile insertions and rescues , making her stand out from the rest .

Ana Khouri in Revelation Space by Alastair Reynolds .
This assassin joins the crew of the Nostalgia For Infinity , intent on killing one of the crewmembers , but then two different digital entities fight over control of her , and thus of the ship .
Also a killer pilot is the ship 's de facto captain , Illia Volyova .
Advertisement
Mary Raven from Ignition City .
This grounded space pilot journeys to Earth 's last spaceport , Ignition City , to find out what happened to her dad , in this new comic by Warren Ellis and Gianluca Pagliarani .
Space - jockey Mary Raven is determined to find out what happened to her dad , and she wo n't leave Ignition City until she gets some answers .

Lt. Shane Vansen from Space : Above And Beyond .
According to this site , she 's " one of Earth 's most celebrated pilots , " piloting the SA - 43 Hammerhead space fighter into battle .

Corp. Ferro in Aliens .
Okay , sure , she gets killed after speaking only a couple lines of dialogue .
But she has cool sunglasses , and she manages to put the ship down through a lot of turbulence .

Carmen Ibanez in Starship Troopers .
Many of the badass pilots in this movie are women , and Carmen ( Denise Richards ) is the most memorable of them .
She 's a pilot in the SICON fleet , who pilots the drop ship , and even helps on the ground when things get rough .

Col. Wilma Deering in Buck Rogers In The 25th Century .
She does n't just look good in a slinky jumpsuit , or boogieing next to Buck — Wilma 's an ace fighter pilot in her own right , and a lot of episodes see her flying off solo to deal with the bikini - clad menace of the week .
Advertisement
Aeryn Sun in Farscape .
She 's a formidable fighter generally , but she 's also a former Peacekeeper pilot , and some of her best moments involve her taking the helm of a ship — like the season two finale , when Crichton is flying away with Scorpius ' mind controlling him , and Aeryn chases after him in her own ship .

Yoninne Leg - Wot from The Witling by Vernor Vinge .
We do n't actually get to see much of her piloting skills , since she and her companion Ajao Bjault get stranded on the planet full of telekinetic aliens early on .
But she does turn out to be resourceful , and despite being unattractive by Earth standards , she helps win over the " witling " of the story 's title , Prince Pelio .

River in Serenity .
Okay , so Serenity 's real pilot is , and always will be , Wash .
But you can tell , at the end of the movie , that River is gearing up to be a pretty great pilot in her own right .
And in the series of movie sequels that unspool in my daydreams from time to time , she 's piloting the ship all the time .
Advertisement
Manda in Burning The Ice by Laura J. Mixon .
Manda CarliPablo 's stigmatized because she 's the only colonist on a barren gas giant who 's not a twin or triplet — her other clones died before they were " born " — but her isolation turns out to be a good thing , as she becomes the best pilot in the colony and explores the unexplored regions of this new world — discovering an alien race along the way .
Advertisement
Turanga Leela from Futurama .
Despite being captain , she 's also always ready to take the helm of the Planet Express ship , and her lack of three - dimensional vision does n't seem to interfere with her amazing piloting skills .
Advertisement
Jaina Solo from the Star Wars expanded universe .
The daughter of Han Solo and Princess Leia did n't just inherit her mom's Force powers — she also became a kick - ass pilot , like her dad .
She flew the Millenium Falcon on a few occasions .
When she got caught flying the Merry Miner , an unarmed mining ship , during the Yuuzhan Vong war , she managed to dodge the aliens ' attacks until help arrived .
And then she became one of the New Republic 's most valued starfighter pilots .
Advertisement
Captain Beka Valentine from Andromeda .
Thanks to everyone who suggested adding her —
Beka Valentine is , among other things , the Andromeda 's first officer and pilot , taking advantage of her better - than - human reaction times and strength .

Tanni from Mutineer 's Moon by David Weber
Here 's the key sequence :
" And , " MacMahan added gently , " Tanni will be your pilot . "
" What ? ! "
" Tanni will be your pilot , " MacMahan repeated mildly .
" I 'm speaking now as the commander of a military operation , and I do n't have time to be diplomatic , so both of you just shut up and listen ... we can't afford anything but our very best pilot behind those controls .
You 're good , Colin , and your reaction time is phenomenal even by Imperial standards , but good as you are , you have very little experience in an Imperial fighter .
Tanni , on the other hand , is a natural pilot and the youngest of our Imperials , with reaction time almost as good as yours but far , far more experience .
The overall mission will be under your command , but she 's your pilot and you 're her electronics officer , or neither of you goes . "

Kathryn Fairly in Space Camp .
A group of teenagers get to go aboard the Space Shuttle Atlantis during a test - firing of its engines .
But the mean android named Jinx decides to — what else — jinx them by making the space shuttle blast off for real .
They 're stuck in orbit , without enough oxygen to get home .
And Kathryn ( Lea Thompson ) , who was struggling with the " multi-axis trainer " that 's required for shuttle pilots , manages to ace the real - life situation that simulator creates : a flat spin after the shuttle 's reorbit burn .
She brings that bird down safe and proves she 's an awesome pilot .
Advertisement
Starbuck from Battlestar Galactica .
As I said before , these are in no particular order — but if they were , Starbuck would be # 1 in any list .
She 's clearly the best pilot among Battlestar 's flyboys and - girls .
Adama always refers to her as his best pilot , and she pushes herself harder than anyone else .
Kat may have tried to challenge Starbuck 's impressive kill rate , but she never really had a hope .

The ad - serving system profiles the sites people visit online The European Commission has started legal action against Britain over the online advertising technology Phorm .
It follows complaints to the EC over how the behavioural advertising service was tested on BT 's broadband network without the consent of users .
Last year Britain had said it was happy Phorm conformed to European data laws .
But the commission has said Phorm " intercepted " user data without clear consent and the UK need to look again at its online privacy laws .
In a statement , Phorm said its technology was " fully compliant with UK legislation and relevant EU directives " .
It added that it did not believe the Commission 's legal action would have " any impact on the company 's plans going forwards " .
At the heart of the legal action by the EC is whether users have given their consent to have their data intercepted by the advertising system .
' Clear consent '
A spokeswoman from the commission told BBC News that the EC wanted the UK to ensure there were procedures in place to ensure " clear consent from the user that his or her private data is being used " .
At present , UK law only covers " intentional " interceptions and requires there only to be a " reasonable grounds for believing " that consent to interception has been given .
" Technologies like internet behavioural advertising can be useful for businesses and consumers but they must be used in a way that complies with EU rules , " the EU 's Telecoms Commissioner Viviane Reding said in a statement .
She added : " We have been following the Phorm case for some time and have concluded that there are problems in the way the UK has implemented parts of the EU rules on the confidentiality of communications . "
It will in effect apply pressure to the information commissioner and the Home Office
Nicholas Bohm , FIPR
Ms Reding said Britain needed to to change its national laws to ensure there were proper sanctions to enforce EU confidentiality rules .
Unless Britain complies , Ms Reding has the power to issue a final warning before taking the country to the 27 - nation EU 's top court , the European Court of Justice .
If it rules in favour of the European Commission , the court can force Britain to change its laws .
BT admitted last year it had tested Phorm 's technology on its network with thousands of customers without asking for their consent or informing them of the trials .
It later carried out further trials of the service , which it markets as Webwise , with the consent of users .
BT and Phorm have previously said they sought legal advice before carrying out the first trials .
Phorm 's works by " trawling " websites visited by users whose ISPs have signed up to the service and for whom the technology is switched on , and then matches keywords from the content of the page to an " anonymous " profile .
Targeted adverts
Users are then targeted with adverts that are more tailored to their interests on partner websites that have signed up to Phorm 's technology .
The technology differs from other behavioural advertising systems which tend to use data only from partner websites visited by users , and do not work in conjunction with internet service providers .
The service has proved controversial for some campaigners who believe it breaks UK data interception laws .
Nicholas Bohm , general counsel for the Foundation for Information Policy Research , which has led the criticisms of Phorm 's technology , said he welcomed the EC 's intervention .
" It will in effect apply pressure to the information commissioner and the Home Office and maybe even the Crown Prosecution Service in its contemplation of the illegality of the BT trials . "
Welcomed emphasis
He said FIPR welcomed the emphasis on user consent , but also stressed that the body felt that website owners too should give their consent for their sites to be trawled by Phorm 's technology .
" It is pleasing to see the EC is taking this issue more seriously than UK government departments here , " he added .
Last year , Phorm received clearance from the Home Office and police closed a file on BT trials of the technology which looked into their legality .
The UK government said last year the technology could only be rolled out if users had given their consent and it was easy for people to opt out .
The European Union Directive on Privacy and Electronic Communications requires member states to ensure the confidentiality of their communications and related traffic data .
States must , it says , prohibit interception and surveillance unless the users concerned have given their consent .
The commission has also said it is concerned that the UK does not have an independent national supervisory authority to deal with the intentional interceptions of user data .
Mr Bohm suggested that the Information Commissioner 's role could be widened to deal with the issue of interception of user data .
Jim Killock , executive director of the Open Rights Group said : " There are big legal questions surrounding BT 's use of Phorm , so we welcome the EU taking the government to task .
" BT should respect everyone 's privacy and drop their plans to snoop on the internet before they damage their own reputation further .
Websites should protect their users and block Phorm now . "
BT declined to comment on the EC 's actions .

July 30 , 2009 -- Americans spend almost a third as much money out - of pocket on herbal supplements and other alternative medicines as they do on prescription drugs , a new government report shows .
Out - of - pocket spending on herbal supplements , chiropractic visits , meditation , and other forms of complementary and alternative medicines ( CAM ) was estimated at $ 34 billion in a single year .
The estimate was based on responses to a national health survey conducted in 2007 by the CDC ’s National Center for Health Statistics ( NCHS ) .
“ The bottom line is that Americans spend a lot of money on CAM products , classes , materials and practitioner visits , ” National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine ( NCCAM ) Director Josephine P. Briggs , MD , said in a media briefing today .
“ We estimate that this ( represents ) approximately 11 % of the total out - of - pocket spending on health care . ”
Perhaps the reactionary forces left over from the disgraced , banished Bush Regime were buoyed today by Obama naming rubber stamp Republican zombie John McHugh ( R - NY ) Secretary of the Army .
With an even more conservative voting record than raving right - wing sociopaths like Dana Rohrabacher ( R - CA ) , Jim Sensenbrenner ( R - WI ) , Lincoln Diaz - Balart ( R- FL ) , Ileana Ros-Lehtinen ( R- FL ) , Jeff Flake ( R - AZ ) , Brian Bilbray ( R- CA ) and Vern Buchanan ( R- FL ) , McHugh has opposed virtually every single initiative Obama has taken to rescue the country from 8 years of Republican misrule ( although he supposedly announced yesterday that he favors scrapping the heinous Do n't Ask Don't Tell policy that has become a cornerstone of modern Republicanism , as key to the definition of the party as racism , xenophobia , union - bashing , and corporate ass - licking ) .
It looks like this inspired war criminal and Israeli spy Paul Wolfowitz , currently in hiding at the extremist " think " tank , AEI , to pen an OpEd for a New York - based GOP party organ .
Writing of the expectations for President Obama 's speech in Cairo , Wolfowitz hopes that the president wo n't " walk away from what President George W. Bush called ' the freedom agenda . '
That would be a great mistake for the U.S. and for the Muslim world . "
Apparently Wolfowitz , one of the architects of the most disastrous foreign policies in the history of the United States , thinks he knows what the " Muslim world " needs .
He then has the colossal hubris to go on to make a series of recommendations to the president : he should insult his Egyptian hosts and the entire Muslim world by pointing out their less than satisfactory record on human rights and women 's rights , and insisting that their standard of elections are n't up to the U.S. model -- think about the 2000 presidential decision -- and then chastise them for church burnings , rub their noses in the dirt of U.S. invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan and make it clear that he plans to follow in George Bush 's footsteps .
Like I said , Wolfowitz is hiding out at the American Enterprise Institute these days , shielded from any exposure to reality whatsoever .
I 'd like to suggest that he get out more -- maybe make a trip to a couple of Arab countries and chat with some people there .
Maybe he could do some fashion consulting while he 's over there :

Limiting Inquiry To Low Level Operatives Not Sufficient
NEW YORK  According to recent news reports , Attorney General Eric Holder is considering appointing a prosecutor to investigate torture crimes under the Bush administration .
However , many of these reports indicate that Holder is contemplating a narrow investigation that would focus only on CIA interrogators and contract employees who violated the Bush administrations guidelines .
CIA Spokesperson Paul Gimigliano was quoted in todays New York Times as saying ,  This has all been reviewed and dealt with before . 
The following can be attributed to Anthony D. Romero , Executive Director of the American Civil Liberties Union :
" The evidence is abundantly clear that the crime of torture was authorized at the highest levels of the Bush administration .
Making low - level officials take the fall while the big fish get away is not how we do justice in America .
In America , no one is above the law , regardless of rank or position .
A narrow investigation that fails from the outset to follow the facts where they lead would only perpetuate the Bush administrations false claim that torture was the result of a few bad apples ,  rather than confront the reality that it was a widespread , systemic and orchestrated policy set at the highest levels of government .
" For the CIA to claim that this has all been dealt with before  is both disingenuous and disturbing when , to date  despite the mountains of evidence of high - level involvement  the highest ranking official to be prosecuted for abuse was a Lieutenant Colonel .
Turning away from the facts does not make them go away .
 Attorney General Holder should enforce the law even - handedly and objectively , and not let political calculations stand in the way .
Those who authorized , legally justified and carried out this dark spot on our nations history must be held accountable . 
Possession is nine - tenths of the law .
That ’s Mike Campbell ’s bitter motto .
“ The moment you move off , you ’re finished , ” is how he puts it .
The thugs who want his farm almost finished him .
They beat the 75 - year - old so badly last July that he has n’t been quite the same since .
They broke his wife ’s arm .
But the Campbells were n’t finished yet .
Ignoring their nightmares and their forebodings , they went home to their farm .
Returning to the land where he ’d lived for 36 years , Campbell prepared himself for the empty closets , the looted farmhouse .

But he was n’t ready for the sight that greeted him , driving through the gate that August day :
All the farmworkers had gathered in welcome .
“ It was quite an emotional time .
They were shaking hands .
I even got some hugs , which no one would believe .
But I did , ” he says , sounding almost surprised .
Relieved to be alive and back home , Campbell got on with his job .
But when he sat down to calculate how much fertilizer to spray on an acre of crops , the numbers mocked him .
He tried again .
And again .
But a simple sum he ’d done all his life was beyond him .
“ I just ca n’t work it out .
It ’s like a closed book , ” he says .
Advertisement
He forgot things or lost his way in the middle of a sentence , as if he ’d aged overnight .
He felt useless and depressed .
His doctors say he sustained brain damage in the beatings .
“ I ’m very much slower than I used to be .
My brain does n’t work , ” he says over a cup of tea .
“ It does .
A little bit , ” his wife , Angela , insists gently .
“ A little bit , ” he frowns .
“ But not much . ”
Hardened after years of loss and disappointment , the old farmer can be a little gruff at times .

Angela Campbell ( nowadays gently correcting anything misremembered ) has always been the soft , idealistic one , the foil to his tough , cynical side .
Whenever she sees their ancient chestnut horse , Ginger , standing patiently on the veranda outside the window , she hurries to feed him slices of bread .
It is she who picks the ticks off him , and carefully washes the cancerous growth on his eye .
It is she who worries about him now .
Thousands of farmers were forced off their land when President Robert Mugabe told war veterans to invade white - owned farms in 2000 .
The seizures destroyed agriculture and the economy , ultimately undermining the entire public sector , including healthcare and education .

A top ruling party official was determined to get Campbell ’s lush 3,000 - acre citrus and mango farm , Mount Carmel , about 60 miles south of the capital , Harare .
But Campbell clung on .
Even after last year ’s beating , Campbell , bruised and frail , was unbowed .
In an interview for an earlier article on the tenacious farmer , he said , “ I do n’t think we would ever have given up . ”
In a sense , Campbell outlasted Mugabe :
He lived to see the president forced to agree in September to share power with the opposition .
Then Campbell and 77 other farmers won a landmark case in November challenging the farm evictions .
Southern Africa ’s highest court , the Southern African Development Community tribunal , ordered authorities to protect farmers from eviction or harassment and demanded compensation for past evictions .

“ I thought we ’d reached the end of the road , ” Campbell says .
When the unity government was sworn in early this year , it seemed that Campbell had won .
He ’d held on just long enough .
But within weeks , Zimbabwe ’s High Court -- largely stacked with Mugabe allies and recipients of former white - owned farms -- rejected the judgment of the SADC court .
Dozens of farms were invaded .
As leader of the appeal , Campbell was a prime target .
Advertisement
The invaders , led by a war veteran named Chimbambira , arrived at Mount Carmel on April 3 .
There were about 10 young thugs , armed with pellet guns .
But about 150 farmworkers , afraid they would lose their jobs if Campbell left the farm , confronted the invaders and chased them away .
The next morning , a phalanx of riot police arrived and beat or arrested many of the workers .
That night the invaders were back , on the Campbells ’ veranda , singing war songs .
“ They were beating on the door and I heard the grindstone going , as if they were sharpening something , ” Campbell says .
“ Then they smashed the kitchen door and got into the kitchen . ”
Advertisement
Piercing screams drifted from the workshop , where the thugs were beating a worker .
Campbell stood , terrified , in the hall , listening to the invaders on the other side of a locked door .
He remembered the moment last June when he was hit on the head by other ruling party thugs and knocked out cold .
He knew he could n’t survive another beating .
“ I decided I was going to shoot anyone who came through that door .
I said , ‘ Look , if you come through that door , I ’ll shoot you .
You ’ll be a dead duck . ’
Otherwise they ’ll hit you on the head and you ’re dead . ”
The couple radioed their family , who live on the neighboring homestead .
Their son - in - law , Ben Freeth , and a friend crept through the garden to the other side of the house , where Angela Campbell let them in .
Advertisement
“ Once they realized we had reinforcements , they backed off , ” she says .
Police initially refused to come , but eventually arrived about 4 a.m. , warned the invaders to be quiet and left .
Late the next afternoon the Campbells returned from lunch at their daughter ’s neighboring house .
The thugs surrounded the house , shouting threats and firing pellet guns .
“ Just as it was getting dark they started to become very threatening , ” Angela Campbell says .
“ The threats became worse and worse .
They built a huge fire near the house . ”
Family and friends came over to help defend the farm .
But because Mike Campbell was such a target for arrest , the family decided that he and Angela should leave until things settled down .
They feared he would not survive a jail stint , and farmers , especially ones involved in the SADC appeal , recently have been arrested and jailed for being on their own farms .
Advertisement
At first , Campbell resisted .
“ I have always agreed with the theory that if you are seen to move , that ’s the end , ” he says .
“ But they were so threatening , and we ’d been beaten up nine months before .
“ I do n’t know what I was thinking .
I thought it would just be for one night or two nights . ”
But a few days went by .
And then a few days more .
Advertisement
The realization crept up like a cat padding silently into a room .
If Campbell was right , if possession really was nine - tenths of the law , then after years of struggle and resistance , they had finally lost the farm .
Visiting Freeth ’s house , I take an evening walk with him to the edge of Mount Carmel farm .
A tractor putters , harvesting the last of the Campbell ’s $ 600,000 mango crop .
Youths mill about .
But when they see us on the border of the land , they shout furiously and give chase .
“ Come here ! ” one orders .
“ Come here !
I ’ll shoot you !
I ’ll cut your neck . ”
We leave , steadily walking back to Freeth ’s house .
I follow Freeth , trying not to break into a run .
Advertisement
The farmer and his wife cannot get close to the eight cows and their calves , who rely on them and their workers to fill the water trough .
No one knows the fate of Angela ’s two cats .
No one knows how the old horse Ginger is doing .
“ He wo n’t make it through the winter , ” Campbell says gruffly .
Campbell has not given up .
Not yet .
But he ’s close .
“ But Mike is a pessimist , by nature , ” Angela says softly .
“ I ’m optimistic . ”

He was , he told Goldman , joining a new trading company , which various news reports said was in Chicago .
He said he would earn triple the $ 400,000 salary he commanded at Goldman .
But , just before he left , according to the complaint , Mr. Aleynikov used his desktop computer at Goldman ’s New York offices to upload a stream of code to a Web site hosted by a server based in Germany .
Later , he downloaded the files again to his home computer , his laptop computer and to a memory device .
He was caught when the bank noticed the surge of data leaving its servers  and despite his prowess as a highly paid programmer , his activities were recorded even though he tried to erase his programming commands because Goldman kept back - up records .
When confronted by federal investigators at the airport in Newark , Mr. Aleynikov , a naturalized American citizen who immigrated from Russia and now lives in New Jersey , insisted that he had intended to collect “ open source ” files on which he had worked and only later realized he had copied more files than he had intended .
On Monday , Goldman Sachs refused to comment publicly on the attempted theft .
A person familiar with the bank said it had since “ secured its systems . ”
This person , who asked not to be identified , given the confidential nature of the programs , insisted that the theft had had no effect on Goldman Sachs ’s business or on that of its clients .
However , at a court appearance in Manhattan on July 4 , Joseph Facciponti , the assistant United States attorney , told a federal judge that Mr. Aleynikov ’s supposed theft posed a risk to United States financial markets and that other people may have had access to it , according to Bloomberg .

That 's really odd and , honestly , a bit funny .
Maybe he 's just trying to domesticate you ?
Or , and this is a stretch , he 's not as he appears and is really putting you down with what could be considered demeaning behavior ( I 'm seriously doubting this though ) .
Maybe he 's into animal spirits stuff ?
But I really do n't think he hates you , unless you 're really getting the feeling that he 's doing it for evil reasons .
Maybe you should find a pet name for him and treat him like that animal ?
Good luck !
ISTANBUL ( Reuters ) - Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan said Friday genocide was being committed in China ’s northwest province of Xinjiang and called on Chinese authorities to intervene to prevent more deaths .
“ The incidents in China are , simply put , a genocide .
There ’s no point in interpreting this otherwise , ” Erdogan said .
Rioting between Muslim Uighurs and Han Chinese in Xinjiang has killed 156 people and wounded more than 1,000 in the worst ethnic violence in China in decades .
Both Uighurs and the Han have claimed a higher death toll from the strife .
“ We ’re having trouble understanding how the Chinese government would remain a bystander to this , ” Erdogan told reporters in comments broadcast live on NTV television .
“ We want the Chinese administration , with which our bilateral ties are continuously improving , to show sensitivity . ”
Muslim Turkey shares linguistic and religious links with Uighurs , and Turkish nationalists see Xinjiang as the easternmost frontier of Turkic ethnicity .
Thousands of Uighur immigrants live in Turkey .
Turkey has sought to boost ties with China , the world ’s third - biggest economy .
President Abdullah
Gul last month became the first Turkish president to visit China in 15 years , signing $ 1.5 billion worth of trade deals , according to Turkish media .
Turkey ’s Industry Minister Thursday called on Turks to boycott Chinese goods to protest the violence in Xinjiang , but a spokesman said this was the minister ’s personal view and not government policy .
Thursday , Erdogan said Turkey would grant a visa to exiled Uighur leader Rebiya Kadeer , who is based in the United States .
Kadeer told Turkish television that Turkish authorities had twice denied her visa application to visit the country .
Motorcross rock star Robbie Maddison recently performed an amazing tour de force by flawlessly executing a no-handed backflip over a wide open Tower Bridge on July 13th at 2:55 am in London .
The last big stunt the 27 - year - old Australian completed was soaring off a ramp onto a life - size replica of the Arc de Triomphe in Las Vegas on New Year ’s Eve , which was the highest ever “ step up ” leap .
This daredevil and stunt bike phenom also holds the world record for the longest ever motorbike jump of 350.7 ft ( 106.9 meters ) .
Check out the video after the jump !
Robbie Maddison hit the ramp at about 40 miles per hours , yanked the handlebars and then let go to rip off a no-hands backflip over a raised Tower Bridge .
The landing was absolutely perfect .
Nothing like flying upside - down 100 feet above the Thames River to get the blood pumping .
I only wish that this tremendous feat was captured better for the internet .
The video that ’s currently available just does n’t do it justice .
We ’ll update this if some more enthralling footage emerges .

Luke Jackson is a cool , gutsy prisoner in a Southern chain gang , who , while refusing to buckle under to authority , keeps escaping and being recaptured .
The prisoners admire Luke because , as Dragline explains it , " You 're an original , that 's what you are ! "
Nevertheless , the camp staff actively works to crush Luke until he finally breaks .

While Humpback
Whales employ several hunting techniques both individually and as a group ( pod ) , their most dramatic feeding method is surely bubble net feeding .
Bur first , let ’s look at some quick facts about this incredible mammal .
The Humpback Whale
– A full size adult can range from : 48 to 62.5 ft ( 14.6 to 19 m )
– Weight is approximately : 36 metric tons or 80,000 pounds
– Humpback whales can dive for up to 30 minutes to a depth of 500 - 700 feet ( 150 - 210 m )
– Humpback whales normally swim 3 - 9 mph ( 4.8 - 14 km /h ) , but can go up to 15 - 16.5 mph ( 24 - 26.5 km /h ) in bursts when in danger
– Humpback whales have a life expectancy of 45 - 50 years
Feeding
Humpback whales ( like all baleen whales ) only feed in the summer , living off their fat reserves in the winter .
Their diet consists of : tiny crustaceans ( e.g. , krill ) , plankton , and small fish ( including herring , mackerel , capelin , and sandeel ) .
During feeding season , Humpback whales can eat anywhere between 3,000 – 5,5500 pounds ( 1,360 kg – 2495 kg ) of the animals above per day .
Bubble Net Feeding in three easy steps :
1 . A pod of whales blows bubbles while swimming in circles to create a ring of bubbles ( the ring can be up to 100 feet or 30 meters in diameter )
2 . The ring encircles the fish , which are too scared to cross the bubbles .
The whales swim in a smaller and smaller circles , tightening the ring and making high pitched sounds to confuse the fish
3 . The whales then suddenly swim upward through the bubble net , mouths agape , swallowing thousands of fish in one gulp
The video below is an awesome demonstration of Humpback whales bubble net feeding on a school of herring

— Christopher Swann is a Reuters columnist .
The views expressed are his own —
Optimism has been all but extinguished from the U.S. housing market .
The number of Americans lining up for new home loans is shrinking again , according to Wednesday ’s release from the Mortgage Bankers Association , and the best that can be said of homebuilding is that it has stabilized at almost 80 percent below its peak .
With no end in sight to falling prices , perhaps we should look on the bright side .
Indeed , there are three good reasons why sliding prices are not such a bad thing .
Falling house prices are usually seen as wealth destruction .
But they can also be seen as wealth transfer .
The next generation of homebuyers will benefit from our loss .
Those young homebuyers who have been able to cling onto their jobs are already reaping the advantage .
The American dream of home ownership can now be achieved at bargain basement prices .
Take San Francisco .
If you earned the median wage in San Francisco at the peak of the housing market in 2006 , you would have needed to devote 75 percent of your income to meet mortgage payments on the average home .
Now people will pay just 35 percent of their income , according to Ian Morris , chief U.S. economist at HSBC .
It would no longer be any surprise if prices remained stagnant for a decade – spreading the benefit of cheap housing for at least 13 million new households .
Americans may also reflect that much of their temporary housing wealth was illusory anyway .
Since house prices in a given area tend to rise in tandem , the only way to cash out was to borrow against equity , or move to a cheaper area or smaller space , or die .
A second consolation is political .
Tumbling prices have exposed the flaws in the American government ’s efforts to subsidize housing .
It is now clear that these efforts did more harm than good .
More thoughtful U.S. politicians must now question the mortgage interest tax deduction .
The benefit of this tax was heavily skewed towards high earners since they paid a stiffer tax rate .
Instead of fostering broad home ownership , the deduction encouraged rich Americans to borrow more and build bigger homes .
This is bad financial and even worse environmental policy .
At the very least , Congress should now cap this deduction at $ 500,000 .
The third source of solace is macroeconomic .
For several years America borrowed money from abroad to make an investment that did nothing to expand its productive capacity or its ability to export .
Residential construction in 2005 reached 6.3 percent of US national income — its highest level since 1951 .
A more sober level can be gauged from the average since 1980 , which is 4.5 percent .
Rampant home building went far beyond the actual housing needs of Americans .
Over the past five years around 8.9 million housing units were built and just 6.7 million new households were created , according to Harvard economics professor Edward Glaeser .
The number of vacation homes jumped from 3.6 million in 2002 up to 4.8 million now .
An ever - growing number of U.S. homes were also vacant , as investors waited for tenants or buyers .
Not only did houses become more numerous , they also got bigger .
The average square footage of a U.S. family home expanded from 2,200 to 2,500 over the past eight years .
“ Mistaken beliefs about housing may have crowded out more productive investments , ” argues Glaeser .
Since two - thirds of Americans own their homes , falling prices are never likely to inspire street parades .
The economic loss has certainly outweighed the gains and the banking system may take years to fully recover .
Even so , our loss is a hidden accounting gain for the next swath of homeowners .
A more balanced economy and housing policy may now emerge .
For more philosophically minded Americans , this is a cloud with a silver lining .
Bradley Wiggins ( Garmin - Slipstream ) ended the Tour de France fourth overall , 6-01 behind Alberto Contador and 37 seconds behind Lance Armstrong , equalling Robert Millar ’s British record of fourth place in 1984 .
Now , after all the pain of three weeks in the saddle and the mental pressure of always being a contender , Wiggins can finally sit back and celebrate his achievement .
He probably does not know , but his life and career will probably never be the same .
“ This last week has been a long old week and I ’m pleased its done now , ” Wiggins said just a few minutes after the stage ended in Paris .
“ The last three weeks have changed everything for me .
Obviously I really need to rethink about the next few years .
And realistically , I think I can come back next year and try and get on the podium . ”
“ I ’m not going to say I can win the Tour de France but to repeat this ride or get on the podium will be something . ”
Spirit of Simpson
Wiggins rode the stage to the summit of Mont Ventoux with a photograph of Tom Simpson , who died on the climb , on his top tube .
He is honoured to be regarded as a Tour contender like Simpson and says sealing fourth overall on Mont Ventoux was his best moment of the Tour .
“ Equalling the great Robert Millar and surpassing the even greater Tom Simpson is pretty special .
I do realise what I achieved because I ’ve got a great deal of respect for the sport and for what people have done before me , ” he told the BBC ’s Phil Sheehan in Paris .
“ The Tour de France is the biggest bike race in the world .
Just to be part of it is fantastic .
To do something in it is beyond words . ”
“ I think Monaco was a great result but people expected that .
Andorra was the breakthrough stage and then Verbier was pretty special .
But I think most of all sealing it on the Ventoux was the ultimate .
This has been a pretty special Tour all round . ”
Wiggins has no regrets about finishing fourth behind Contador , Andy Schleck and Armstrong .
“ It ’s no mean feat finishing behind the three guys on the podium .
And I do n’t mind admitting that they are much better bike riders than I am .
I ’m just pleased to be in their company , ” he said .
“ To be on the podium this year would have been a bit of a cheek .
To finish fourth is quite nice .
I ’m there but not quite there and those guys deserve to be on the podium . ”
As Tom Simpson would have perhaps said , a place in the 2010 Tour de France is something to aim for .

Steve Slack , the director of the Centre for HIV and Sexual Health at NHS Sheffield , who is one of the leaflet 's authors , says that instead of promoting teenage sex , it could encourage young people to delay losing their virginity until they are certain they will enjoy the experience .
If you have reached the age of 25 , I have a bit of bad news for you , to wit : it is time , if you have not already done so , for you to emerge from your cocoon of post - adolescent dithering and self - absorption and join the rest of us in the world .
Past the quarter - century mark , you see , certain actions , attitudes , and behaviors will simply no longer do , and while it might seem unpleasant to feign a maturity and solicitousness towards others that you may not genuinely feel , it is not only appreciated by others but necessary for your continued survival .
Continuing to insist past that point that good manners , thoughtfulness , and grooming oppress you in some way is inappropriate and irritating .
Grow up .
And when I instruct you to grow up , I do not mean that you must read up on mortgage rates , put aside candy necklaces , or desist from substituting the word “ poo ” for crucial syllables of movie titles .
Silliness is not only still permitted but actively encouraged .
You must , however , stop viewing carelessness , tardiness , helplessness , or any other quality better suited to a child as either charming or somehow beyond your control .
A certain grace period for the development of basic consideration and self - sufficiency is assumed , but once you have turned 25 , the grace period is over , and starring in a film in your head in which you walk the earth alone is no longer considered a valid lifestyle choice , but rather grounds for exclusion from social occasions .
And now , for those of you who might have misplaced them , marching orders for everyone born before 1980 .
1. Remember to write thank - you notes .
If you do not know when a thank - you note is appropriate , consult an etiquette book — the older and more hidebound the book , the better .
When in doubt , write one anyway ; better to err on the side of formality .
An email is not sufficient thanks for a physical gift .
Purchase stationery and stamps , set aside five minutes , and express your gratitude in writing .
Failure to do so implies that you do n’t care .
This implication is a memorable one .
Enough said .
2 . Do not invite yourself to stay with friends when you travel anymore .
Presumably you have a job , and the means to procure yourself a hotel .
If so , do so .
If not , stay home .
Mentioning that you plan a visit to another city may lead to an invitation to stay with a friend or family member , which you may of course accept ; assuming that “ it ’s cool if you crash ” is not .
Wait for the invitation ; if it is not forthcoming , this is what we call “ a hint , ” and you should take it and make other arrangements .
3 . Do not expect friends to help you move anymore .
You may ask for help ; you may not expect it , particularly if your move date is on a weekday .
Your friends have jobs to go to , and you have accumulated a lot of heavy books by this point in your life .
Hire a mover .
If you cannot afford a mover , sell your books or put them in storage — or do n’t move , but one way or another , you will have to cope .
4. Develop a physical awareness of your surroundings .
As children , we live in our own heads , bonking into things , gnawing on twigs , emitting random squawks because we do n’t know how to talk yet .
Then , we enter nursery school .
You , having graduated college or reached a similar age to that of the college graduate , need to learn to sense others and get out of their way .
Walk single file .
Do n’t blather loudly in public spaces .
Give up your seat to those with disabilities or who are struggling with small children .
Take your headphones off while interacting with clerks and passersby .
Do not walk along and then stop suddenly .
It is not just you on the street ; account for that fact .
5 . Be on time .
The occasional public - transit snafu is forgivable , but consistent lateness is rude , annoying , and self - centered .
If we did n’t care when you showed up , we ’d have said “ any old time ” ; if we said seven , get there at seven or within fifteen minutes .
Do not ditz that you “ lost track of time ” as though time somehow slipped its leash and ran into traffic .
It shows a basic lack of respect for others ; flakiness is not cute anymore , primarily because it never was .
Buy a watch , wind it up , and wear it everywhere you go .
6 . Have enough money .
I do not mean “ give up your scholarly dreams and join the world of corporate finance in order to keep up with the Joneses . ”
I mean that you should not become that girl or boy who is always a few dollars short , can only cover exactly his or her meal but no tip , or “ forgot ” to go to the ATM .
Go to the ATM first , do n’t order things you ca n’t afford , and …
7 . Know how to calculate the tip .
Ten percent of the total ; double it ; done .
You did not have to major in math to know how this works .
You are not dumb , but your Barbie - math - is - hard flailing is agonizing and has outstayed its welcome .
Ten percent times two .
Learn it .
8 . Do not share the crazy dream you had last night with anyone but your mental wellness professional .
Nobody cares .
People who starred in the dream may care , but confine your synopsis to ten words or fewer .
9. Learn to walk in heels .
Gentlemen , you are at your leisure .
Ladies :
If you wear heels , know how to operate them .
Clomping along and placing your foot down flat with each step gives the appearance of a ten - year - old playing dress - up , but a pair of heels is like a bicycle — you need momentum to stay up .
Come down on the heel and carry forward through the toe , using your regular stride .
If you feel wobbly , keep practicing , or get a pair that ’s better suited to your style of walking .
It is n’t a once - a - year prom thing anymore for a lot of you , so please learn to walk in them .
10 .
Have at least one good dress - up outfit .
A dress code , or suggested attire on an invitation , is not an instrument of The Man .
Own one nice dress , or one reasonable suit , or one sharp pair of pants and chic sweater — something you can clean up nice in for a wedding or a semi- formal dinner .
You do n’t have to like it , but if the invitation requests it , put it on .
Every night ca n’t be poker night .
Which reminds me …
11 . Do as invitations ask you .
Do n’t bring a guest when no such courtesy is extended .
Do n’t blow off an RSVP ; it means “ please respond , ” and you should .
“ Regrets only ” means you only answer if you ca n’t come .
If the party starts at eight , show up at eight — not at seven - thirty so you can go a “ better ” party later , not at eleven when dinner is cold .
Eight .
Cocktail parties allow for leeway , of course , but pay attention and read instructions ; your host furnished the details for a reason .
12 . Know how .
Know how to drive .
Know how to read a map .
Know how to get around .
Know how to change a tire , or whom to call if you ca n’t manage it , or how to get to a phone if you do n’t have a cell phone .
We will happily bail you out , until it becomes apparent that it ’s what you always need .
The possibility of a fingernail breaking or a hairstyle becoming compromised is not grounds for purposeful helplessness .
13 . Do n’t use your friends .
It ’s soulless .
It ’s also obvious .
If the only reason you continue to associate with a person is to borrow his or her car , might I remind you that you have now turned 25 and may rent your own .
14 .
Have something to talk about besides college or your job .
College is over .
The war stories have their amusements , but not over and over and not at every gathering .
Get a library card , go to the movies , participate in the world .
Working is not living .
Be interested so that you can be interesting .
15 . Give and receive favors graciously .
If you have agreed to do a favor , you may not 1 ) remind the favoree ceaselessly about how great a pain it is for you , or 2 ) half - ass it because the favoree “ owes you . ”
It is a favor ; it is not required , and if you cannot do it , say so .
If you can do it , pretend that nobody is watching , do it as best you can , and let that be the end of it .
Conversely , if you ask for a favor and the askee cannot do it , do not get snappish .
You can manage .
16 . Drinking until you throw up is no longer properly a point of pride .
It happens to the best of us , but be properly ashamed the next day ; work on your tolerance , or eat something first , but amateur hour ended several years ago .
17 .
Have a real trash receptacle , real Kleenex , and , if you smoke , a real ashtray .
No loose bags on the floor ; no using a roll of toilet paper ; no plates or empty soda cans .
You are not a fierce warrior nomad of the Fratty Bubelatty tribe .
Buy a wastebasket and grown - up paper products .
18 . Universal quiet hours do in fact apply to you .
They are , generally , as follows — midnight to six AM on weekdays , 2 AM to 8 AM on weekends .
Mine is a fairly generous interpretation , by the by , so bass practice should conclude , not start , at ten PM .
Understand also that just because nobody has complained directly to you does not mean that a complaint is not justified , or pending .
Further , get your speakers off the floor .
Yes , “ now . ”
Yes , a rug is still “ the floor . ”
19 .
Take care of yourself .
If you are sick , visit a doctor .
If you are sad , visit a shrink or talk to a friend .
If you are unhappy in love , break up .
If you are fed up with how you look , buy a new shirt or stop eating cheese .
If you have a problem , try to fix it .
Many problems are knotty and need a lot of talking through , or time to resolve , but after a few months of all complaining and no fixing , those around you will begin to wonder if you do n’t enjoy the problems for the attention they bring you .
Venting is fine ; inertia coupled with pouting is not .
Bored ?
Read a magazine .
Mad at someone ?
Say so — to them .
Change is hard ; that ’s too bad .
Effort counts .
Make one .
Your mommy ’s shift is over .
20 . Rudeness is not a signifier of your importance .
Rudeness is a signifier of itself , nothing more .
We all have bad days ; yours is not weightier than anyone else ’s , comparatively , and does not excuse displays of poor breeding .
Be civil or be elsewhere .

Over four extraordinary days in late June , Rupert Murdoch ’s flagship , The Australian , and his capital city dailies in Sydney , Melbourne , Brisbane and Adelaide waged war on Prime Minister Kevin Rudd and Treasurer Wayne Swan — armed only with a forged email .
They savaged Rudd on the grounds that he had lied to parliament and that he and Swan had improperly lobbied for government financial assistance for a Queensland car dealer who was a mate .
They were heady charges and their front - page treatment across the News Ltd stable sent a frisson of excitement through the ranks of the embattled Coalition .
The orchestrated media campaign was music to the ears of Opposition Leader Malcolm Turnbull — if he could damage fatally the Rudd - Swan team then a voter recovery suddenly seemed possible , especially if there was an early election as widely predicted .
The aggressive ambition of Turnbull plus the zealotry of the regime - changers in the editorial chairs at News Ltd made a toxic combination .
There was , of course , one small snag in this breathtaking power play : the sole piece of evidence upon which the political assassins were relying — an email sent by a senior member of Rudd ’s staff to a Treasury official named Godwin Grech — was a fake , a concoction , a fraud .
Until the Australian Federal Police raided Grech ’s Canberra home and seized his computer and its electronic entrails , Turnbull and Murdoch ’s newspapers sang from the same song sheet — or email — alleging that Dr Andrew Charlton , Rudd ’s senior economic adviser , had sent a message to Grech , the Treasury official in charge of organising a financial guarantee package for the credit - squeezed car industry , requesting he give special treatment to a Brisbane car dealer named John Grant .
The situation was complicated because Grant had given Rudd a 1996 Mazda utility truck , aka the " Ruddmobile " , to use as his campaigning vehicle in recent elections and there was no doubt that the glad - handing , knockabout car salesman had dipped into his pocket more than once to help his mate " Ruddie " .
Yet the record showed that Grant — along with many other car dealers and dealerships — had made representations to the Government ; that Grant had not received special treatment ; and , indeed , had not received a cent from the Federal Government .
None of these essential facts fazed the News Ltd editorial offices .
Murdoch ’s papers crystallised the Prime Minister ’s link with Grant into " UteGate " and a scandal leading to the highest elected office in the land was born .
Sydney ’s Daily Telegraph gave notice of its " exclusive " with the front - page headline on June 19 , " Car Deal : PM In Spin " , accompanied by this startling revelation : " The Daily Telegraph has learned of a correspondence trail involving the office of the Prime Minister and Government officials responsible for a $ 2 billion scheme to help cash - strapped car dealers . "
National Political Correspondent Steve Lewis produced further revelations the following day in another front - pager , " Rudd ’s Car Crisis " , which read : " The Rudd Government last night launched a full inquiry into the UteGate affair amid increasing pressure on Prime Minister Kevin Rudd and Treasurer Wayne Swan to resign . "
The early editions even published a mock - up graphic of the alleged email between Charlton and Grech .
In their haste , the News Ltd embroiderers actually got the name of the email recipient wrong .
It read " Godwin Grant " .
Turnbull fumed that Rudd and Swan were guilty of " a shocking abuse of power " , adding : " The Prime Minister and the Treasurer have used their offices and taxpayers ’ resources to seek advantage for one of their mates and they lied about it to parliament . "
Over the weekend of 20 – 21 June the country ’s mass media focused on the email that was driving a stake into the heart of the Rudd Government , with the Prime Minister calling on the Opposition Leader to come clean and produce it .
Turnbull began to look shaky when he declared that he had never seen the email and that it had not been distributed to the media by him or anyone from the Opposition .
He told commercial radio on 20 June : " We did not .
No one in the Opposition provided the text of that email to the News Limited newspapers . "
Over on ABC Radio , Rudd sensed blood : " Mr Turnbull has sought to smear my reputation as Prime Minister , and that of the Treasurer , which is his argument — backgrounding editors across the country , and you know this to be true , over the last couple of weeks , saying that they have a smoking gun against the Government , that it is this email which drops me directly in it . "
The issue was settled a few hours later when the federal police issued a press release stating categorically that the email was a fake and that Grech , whose home had been raided , was assisting them with inquiries .
News Ltd ’s follow - up coverage was extraordinary .
Turnbull , who had been feted as a caped crusader for truth and justice only days earlier , was thrown to the wolves .
Cynically ignoring their own explicit involvement in the whole email scam , Murdoch ’s papers thundered across the land : " Turnbull ’s fake email nightmare " ( The Australian ) ; " BACKFIRE — Turnbull wounded as Utegate email exposed as fake " ( Daily Telegraph ) ; " UTE BACKFIRE —
Fake email turns the tables on embattled Turnbull " ( Brisbane ’s Courier - Mail ) ; " WHAT A CAR WRECK — Ute - gate fake email backfires on Turnbull " ( Melbourne ’s Herald - Sun ) , " GRAND FAKE AUTO — Ute - gate : Email did n’t exist , pressure on Turnbull " ( Adelaide Advertiser ) .
Grech underwent a similar News Ltd makeover .
Hailed as a courageous " whistleblower " on the weekend , poor old Godwin Grech , the man with the Dickensian moniker , suddenly became a dysfunctional " mole " who was sick , reclusive and eccentric , according to unnamed neighbours and colleagues .
The email affair is now in the hands of the Commonwealth Auditor - General and the federal police .
The question remains : how did News Ltd ’s editors , its senior correspondents in the Canberra Press Gallery and political commentators become parties to such an inept , misguided and ludicrous scam to ambush the Australian Prime Minister and his Treasurer and try to force them out of office ?
With the simple use of time - honoured journalistic checks , the email would have been revealed as a forgery .
By way of comparison , when Australian conman Peter Foster told the British Daily Mail in 2002 that he had emails from Cherie Blair about the purchase of two investment units in Bristol , the Mail did not publish them until it had conducted three independent forensic tests .
Obviously , the most stringent scrutiny was advisable in dealing with the convicted fraudster , but the Mail demonstrated in this case the elementary practices of proper journalism .
So why did n’t News Ltd ’s operatives do their job ?
Rudd addressed the lapse in professional standards at a press conference two weeks ago when News Ltd reporter Matthew Franklin asked him about UteGate .
His response was unusually scathing — and marks the first time in living memory that an Australian PM has criticised the Murdoch press .
For that reason alone , Rudd ’s reply is worth quoting at length :
" I think , what a number of people have said to me , Matthew , around the place is where have we kind of got to when you have major papers like the Daily Telegraph , the Courier - Mail and the Adelaide Advertiser running on their front page that the Prime Minister of the country is corrupt , and then , secondly , the editors it seems not having sighted any original document in terms of this email , and thirdly , it turns out that that email is a forgery .
I would have thought a few people would want to know how all that happened , what sort of journalistic checks were put in place for that to be the case , or is it simply being sort of airbrushed from history ? "
The email hoax comes hot on the heels of another News Ltd fiasco .
On 15 March this year , Murdoch ’s largest selling newspaper in Australia , the Sydney - based Sunday Telegraph , published nude photographs of Pauline Hanson .
The go - between was Sydney paparazzo Jamie Fawcett who received a $ 15,000 fee for supplying photographs allegedly taken in 1975 by a former Australian army officer named Jack Johnson .
Sunday Telegraph editor Neil Breen splashed the pictures across several pages as did Murdoch ’s Sunday tabloids in four other State capitals .
The coast - to - coast coverage arrived one week before the Queensland state election in which Ms Hanson was standing as an independent candidate in the outer Brisbane seat of Beaudesert .
How much her political comeback was stymied by the censorious uproar caused by the nude pictures is anybody ’s guess , but she was soundly defeated .
For almost a week after the publication of the steamy portfolio of Hanson photos , Breen defended their authenticity .
Only when faced with incontestable proof that the photos were n’t of Hanson did Breen finally back down .
In May he published a signed 57 - word , three - paragraph apology to Ms Hanson which concluded : " We have learnt a valuable lesson . "
Last month , a private , out - of - court settlement was reached with Hanson .
She has been paid off but Breen , one of Murdoch ’s rising stars , remains the editor of the Sunday Telegraph .
At the National Press Club in Canberra in early July , News Ltd ’s chief executive in Australia , John Hartigan , defended the group ’s coverage of UteGate : " I ’m more than happy with the quality and standards of the reporting , " he declared .
" We ran with the story because it ’s in the public interest . "
Most newspaper readers in Australia would be unaware of these facts because they were n’t covered in News Ltd papers — no surprises there — and they were almost totally ignored by the Fairfax papers as well .
The ABC — apart from the highly commendable and sharp observations of Media Watch presenter Jonathan Holmes — was also silent on the Murdoch papers ’ involvement in this affair .
News
Ltd wants both scandals buried as quickly as possible because it has more important items on its agenda .
In particular it is seeking a greater share of Foxtel , the pay TV monopoly which it currently shares with James Packer and Telstra , and is anxious to soften up the Rudd Government to make its case .
This is a classic case of what Rudyard Kipling once described : " Power without responsibility — the prerogative of the harlot throughout the ages . "
After Global Gaming Factory X announced that it intends to buy The Pirate Bay for $ 7.8 million , the CEO of the company bombarded the press with his revolutionary plans for the site .
By paying both the copyright holders and file - sharers the company aims to reshape the digital media landscape .
We have our doubts .
The sale of the largest BitTorrent tracker in the world to Global Gaming Factory X ( GGF ) blasted like a shockwave though the BitTorrent community yesterday .
For years
The Pirate Bay has been a synonym for free file - sharing , something that many fear will change in the near future .
However , thus far GGF ’s plans for the site and tracker are rather vague and uncertain .
First of all there is a huge divide between what the Pirate Bay co-founders think will happen to the site and what GGF is telling the public .
TorrentFreak has spoken with Pirate Bay co-founders Peter Sunde and Fredrik Neij who both think that the Pirate Bay will stay pretty much like it is now for the time being .
The only difference in the short term , according to their knowledge , is that the site will link to torrents hosted on a third party domain tracked by a third party tracker .
Both the torrent hosting service and the tracker they are referring to are still in development , the co-founders said .
They are not aware of any concrete plans to turn the site into a legal venture .
In an attempt to find out we asked GGF to elaborate on their future plans and the response we got was remarkable .
GFF told us that most of their recent comments to the press were nothing more than “ corporate bla bla . ”
So let ’s take a look at some of the bla bla that surfaced in the past day , to see if it makes any sense at all .
Here are some of the key proposals .
1 . The new Pirate Bay will put a halt to illegal downloading .
2 . The Pirate Bay will compensate rights holders who publish their content on the site
3 . The Pirate Bay will pay users for sharing files .
This sounds very impressive but , to put it mildly , it raises a few concerns .
It ’s basically the same as saying that iTunes would pay its users to share music .
When GGF has to pay both file - sharers and content providers they will undoubtedly have to raise huge sums money from a third party .
So what is going to bring in this cash ?
Ads of course !
GGF is predicting to sell ads like no other website in the world has ever done .
They told BusinessWeek that they hope to make as much as $ 672 million a year from advertisements .
GGF is also planning to raise money from ISPs .
Theoretically ISPs might be willing to contribute because they could save on bandwidth costs if most of the files are served locally or directly from caching services , but it wont be enough .
Also , they assume that The Pirate Bay will generate a significant portion of Internet traffic once they go ‘ legal ’ , which is doubtful .
An even more significant problem is keeping the current users on board and cutting deals with content providers , all at the same time .
This is an almost impossible task since copyright holders will only join if there is no illegal content on the site , and users will only stay if there is enough free and unrestricted DRM - free content available .
This means that GGF has to cut deals with pretty much every large music and movie studio from the start to have even a chance of survival .
Even if they manage that , they also have to collect millions of dollars to compensate both the users and copyright holders .
Nevertheless , only hours after they announced they would acquire The Pirate Bay , GGF claimed that the entertainment companies they ’ve spoken to are already interested in teaming up with the site they fought long and hard in court .
Perhaps the Big Four are more open - minded than we expected – maybe GGF will draw on the business relationship it built with Vivendi in 2007 ?
No further explanation is needed to see that the bright future GGF is selling will never happen .
Their plans seem to be completely delusional , at least in this world , and it ’s even a mystery where they will get the $ 7.8 million funding to actually buy the site .
If they ever will ….
Stop using racism to excuse failure , Obama tells black America
Barack Obama has delivered a thundering sermon to black America , urging parents to push their children to have dreams beyond simply becoming athletes or rap stars .
The U.S. President declared that racism and poverty were no longer good enough excuses for poor grades or lowered expectations .
Telling black parents that they must accept their responsibilities , he said : ' That means putting away the video games and putting our kids to bed at a reasonable hour .
President Barack Obama walks off stage following a rally in New Jersey last night in which he urged black people to take responsibility for their own situation in life
' It means attending those parent - teacher conferences , reading to our kids and helping them with their homework . '
Thursday night 's speech was the first time Mr Obama has directly confronted the issue of race to a largely black audience since becoming America 's first black president six months ago .
In an impassioned message to black children - his rising voice reminiscent of civil rights leader Martin Luther King - he said : ' No one has written your destiny for you .
' Your destiny is in your hands , and do n't you forget that .
That 's what we have to teach all of our children .
No excuses !
No excuses !
' I want our kids aspiring to be scientists and engineers , doctors and teachers , not just ballers and rappers .
' I want them aspiring to be a Supreme Court justice .
I want them aspiring to be President . '
Mr Obama was speaking in New York to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People , the nation 's biggest civil rights body .
Echoing one of the themes of his presidential campaign , he refused to be bound by political correctness , calling for a ' new mindset , a new set of attitudes ' .
This was needed as ' one of the most durable and destructive legacies of discrimination is how so many in our community have come to expect so little of themselves ' .
President Barack Obama walks down the stairs from Air Force One upon his arrival at Andrews Air Force Base ahead of his fiery speech to Black America
Mr Obama urged blacks to recapture the spirit of the civil rights movement half - a- century ago to tackle problems such as joblessness , Aids and spiralling health - care costs .
He said they needed ' the same commitment , the same sense of urgency , the same sense of sacrifice ' .
At times during the 45 - minute speech , he was laughing with the packed audience .
At others , however , he was lecturing them with a fiery intensity that brooked no argument .
The President said his own life could easily have taken a wrong turn if not for his mother , who was white .
' She pushed me and cared about my education .
She taught me right from wrong .
I had the chance to make the most of my abilities . '
But he added : ' When I drive through Harlem and the south side of Chicago and I see young men on corners , I say " There but for the grace of God go I " .'
However , Mr Obama admitted that inequality was still a problem .
' Make no mistake , the pain of discrimination is still felt in America , ' he said , mentioning black women , Latinos , Muslims and homosexuals .
The commonest alternative meaning of libertarian is applied to Republicans who feel alienated by what they perceive as their party 's " big government " policies , especially with regard to religion .
These self - described libertarians generally do n't adopt the views described in the Libertarian Party 's platform , such as elimination of the entire welfare system , abolition of the FCC , repeal of the Sixteenth Amendment , and legalization of all drugs .
The odd thing is , the Libertarian Party actually nominated one of these fakers in last year 's presidential election .
As a Congressman , Bob Barr had a long history of intrusive policy - making .
While he appears to have genuinely evolved in his views on marijuana , he dodges questions about his current views on abortion and hard drugs and tries to keep the discussion focused on civil liberties .
The eminently pro-torture Glenn Beck calls himself a libertarian .
So does Dennis Miller , who supports racial profiling and gun control .
Even some on the left have adopted the label .
The most bizarre example has to be Bill Maher , whose views on guns , education , and the environment are well within the liberal mainstream and at odds with principles espoused by movement libertarians .
It 's amusing to watch his many " I 'm a libertarian , but .... " moments on his show whenever he brings on guests like Ron Paul or Larry Elder .
Why do so many people like to call themselves libertarian when the label does n't fit ?
It could be the root word liberty , which appeals naturally to Americans .
Liberal has the same Latin root , but after decades of right - wing abuse the word has lost its luster .
One way or another , Americans of all political stripes want to say their political outlook starts with a belief in freedom .
In his CPAC speech , Rush Limbaugh defined the cornerstone of conservatism as " individual liberty , " this from a guy who supported tougher drug laws before he became a victim to them .
Maybe instead of co-opting the term libertarian , we ought to be pointing out that libertarian ideas do n't necessarily lead to a freer society .
For example , Ron Paul is on record having opposed the landmark Supreme Court decision Lawrence v. Texas that struck down anti-sodomy laws .
He argues that the matter should be left to the states .
But giving greater freedom to the states would , in this case , reduce individual liberty .
Let libertarians be libertarians .
Their outlook is unique and interesting and a constructive part of our country 's dialogue .
It would be a shame to see the term rendered meaningless through overuse .
The ubiquitous barcodes found on product packaging provide information to the scanner at the checkout counter , but that 's about all they do .
Now , researchers at the Media Lab have come up with a new kind of very tiny barcode that could provide a variety of useful information to shoppers as they scan the shelves -- and could even lead to new devices for classroom presentations , business meetings , videogames or motion - capture systems .
The new system , called Bokode , is based on a new way of encoding visual information , explains Media Lab Associate Professor Ramesh Raskar , who leads the lab 's Camera Culture group .
Until now , there have been three approaches to communicating data optically : through ordinary imaging ( using two - dimensional space ) , through temporal variations such as a flashing light or moving image ( using the time dimension ) , or through variations in the wavelength of light ( used in fiber - optic systems to provide multiple channels of information simultaneously through a single fiber ) .
But the new system uses a whole new approach , encoding data in the angular dimension : Rays of light coming from the new tags vary in brightness depending on the angle at which they emerge .
" Almost no one seems to have used " this method of encoding information , Raskar says .
" There have been three ways to encode information optically , and now we have a new one .
" The new concept will be presented this August in New Orleans at SIGGRAPH , the leading international conference and exhibition on computer graphics and interactive techniques .
It is one of six papers , out of 439 technical papers submitted , that was selected as a highlight of the conference .
The lead author of the paper is Media Lab postdoc Ankit Mohan .
The co-authors , besides Raskar , are graduate student Grace Woo , Shinsaku Hiura ( a visiting professor from Osaka University ) , and postdoc Quinn Smithwick .
The tiny labels are just 3 millimeters across -- about the size of the @ symbol on a typical computer keyboard .
Yet they can contain far more information than an ordinary barcode : thousands of bits .
Currently they require a lens and a built - in LED light source , but future versions could be made reflective , similar to the holographic images now frequently found on credit cards , which would be much cheaper and more unobtrusive .
"
We 're trying to make it nearly invisible , but at the same time easy to read with a standard camera , even a mobile phone camera , " Mohan says .
One of the advantages of the new labels is that unlike today 's barcodes , they can be " read " from a distance -- up to a few meters away .
In addition , unlike the laser scanners required to read today 's labels , these can be read using any standard digital camera , such as those now built in to about a billion cellphones around the world .
The name Bokode comes from the Japanese photography term bokeh , which refers to the round blob produced in an out - of - focus image of a light source .
The Bokode system uses an out - of - focus camera -- which allows the angle - encoded information to emerge from the resulting blurred spot -- to record the encoded information from the tiny tag .
But in addition to being readable by any ordinary camera ( with the focus set to infinity ) , it can also be read directly by eye , simply by getting very close -- less than an inch away -- to the tag .
As a replacement for conventional barcodes , the Bokode system could have several advantages , Mohan says .
It could provide far more information ( such as the complete nutrition label from a food product ) , be readable from a distance by a shopper scanning the supermarket shelves , and allow easy product comparisons because several items near each other on the shelves could all be scanned at once .
In addition to conventional barcode applications , the team envisions some new kinds of uses for the new tags .
For example , the tag could be in a tiny keychain - like device held by the user , scanned by a camera in the front of a room , to allow multiple people to interact with a displayed image , for example in a classroom or a business presentation .
The camera could tell the identity of each person pointing their device at the screen , as well as exactly where they each were pointing .
This could allow everyone in the room to respond simultaneously to a quiz , and the teacher to know instantly how many people , and which ones , got it right -- and thus know whether the group was getting the point of the lesson .
The devices could also be used for the motion - capture systems used to create videogames or computer - generated movie scenes .
Typically , video cameras record a person or object 's motions using colored dots or balls attached to various parts of the person 's body .
The Bokode system would allow the camera to record very precisely not just the position but the angle of each tag -- with an accuracy of a tenth of a degree .
This is far more accurate than any present motion capture system .
Bokode " could enable a whole new range of applications , " Raskar says .
In the future , they could be used in situations such as museum exhibit labels , where the tiny codes would be unobtrusive and not detract from the art or other exhibit , but could send a whole host of background information to viewers through the use of their cellphone cameras .
Or a restaurant could make its menu available to a passerby on the sidewalk .
It could also replace RFID systems in some near - field communication applications , Mohan suggested .
For example , while RFIDs , now used in some ID cards , can provide a great deal of information , that information can be read from a distance , even when the card is inside a wallet .
That makes them inappropriate for credit cards , for example , because the information could be retrieved by an unauthorized observer .
But the Bokode could encode just as much information , but require an open line - of - sight to the card to be read , increasing security .
The prototype devices produced at the Media Lab currently cost about $ 5 each , most of that cost due to use of an off - the - shelf convex glass lens , but Raskar says that price could easily drop to 5 cents once they are produced even in volumes of a few hundred units .
The work was supported by grants from Nokia , Samsung , and the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation .
The SIGGRAPH paper , " Bokode : Imperceptible Visual Tags for Camera - based Interaction from a Distance , " will be available online at the conference website starting on Monday , July 27 .
On Tuesday , Michael Silver of Gartner took Microsoft to the woodshed over the company 's decision to let computer makers sell PCs with Windows XP for only six months after Windows 7 debuts .
Windows XP : The Microsoft OS That Just Wo n't Die
Silver blasted the idea as a " real mess , " and said that it would make it more difficult for companies to manage their PCs , and more expensive to upgrade them to Windows 7 down the road .
Because of Windows 7's Oct. 22 launch date , the six - month cap meant that OEMs would have to stop shipping PCs " downgraded " from Windows 7 Professional or Windows 7 Ultimate to Windows XP Professional at or around April 22 , 2010 .
That policy put enterprises in a bind , Silver argued yesterday .
" For an organization that 's trying to skip Vista , that means they really need to buy new PCs that they need to run on XP , and want to upgrade later to Windows 7 , by April 21 , 2010 , " Silver said .
" [ But ] since a lot of organizations wo n't be ready for Windows 7 until later in 2010 or even early 2011 , any PCs they buy from April 22 , 2010 on , and until they are ready to deploy Windows 7 , would need an upgrade license or [ Software Assurance ] to allow them to run Windows XP temporarily , and upgrade to Windows 7 later on , " he said .
The alternative , said Silver : After April 2010 , companies that wanted to stick with XP for a while longer would have to buy new PCs with Vista Business or Vista Ultimate , which do have downgrade rights to XP , then downgrade to the old OS .
Later , those companies would have to buy an upgrade license from XP to Windows 7 , essentially paying twice .
Microsoft : Our bad
Hours after Silver blasted the plan , however , Microsoft backed off the six - month limit , and confirmed a new policy .
" Windows 7 Professional and Ultimate customers will have the option to downgrade to Windows XP Professional from PCs that ship within 18 months following the general availability of Windows 7 or until the release of a Windows 7 service pack , whichever is sooner , and if a service pack is developed , " a company spokeswoman said in an e-mail .
" This is good , " said Silver of Microsoft 's new plan .
" It proves that Microsoft listens to their customers .
They have changed licensing decisions in response to customer demand before , and hopefully they will do it again , because this is still not great . "
Silver said his problem is with the possible " out " that Microsoft gave itself .
" The new policy is 18 months or SP1 delivery , whichever is sooner , " he said .
" It means that if SP1 shows up in six or eight months , the date suddenly moves in . "
Many software vendors may not release Windows 7 - specific versions or officially support the new operating system for a year or longer after Microsoft rolls out the OS this October , Silver added .
Microsoft 's movable deadline for the end of downgrades could put some enterprises in an awkward spot .
" Organizations waiting on a critical vendor to support their product under Windows 7 may still have a problem , " he said .
A better solution would be a hard deadline , Silver said .
" The policy should be 18 months or SP1 , whichever is later , or just have a reasonable date for the end of the downgrade right , like Dec. 31 , 2010 , " he said .
Assuming that Microsoft holds off delivering Windows 7 SP1 , it 's possible that OEMs could be selling XP - equipped PCs as late as April 2011 .
That 's unlikely , however , as Microsoft typically rolls out the first service pack for a new OS much sooner .
It released Vista SP1 to most users in March 2008 , less than 14 months after Vista 's retail availability .
Windows XP SP1 appeared even sooner , in September 2002 , a little more than 10 months after XP 's launch .
Windows 2000 SP1 , meanwhile , was released just six months after that OS shipped .
Microsoft also slipped in a reminder about XP 's limited lifespan in its e-mailed announcement .
" Windows XP is currently in the extended support phase and Microsoft encourages customers to migrate to either Windows Vista or Windows 7 as soon as possible , " the spokeswoman said yesterday .
As per its lifecycle policy , Microsoft will officially retire Windows XP , halting all patch development , including security updates , in April 2014 .

In the early 1950s the same thought occurred to many people at once : things are improving so fast and so regularly , there might be a pattern to the improvements .
Maybe we could plot technological progress to date , then extrapolate the curves and see what the future holds .
Among the first to do this systemically was the US Air Force .
They needed a long - term schedule of what kinds of planes they should be funding , but aerospace was one of the fastest moving frontiers in technology .
Obviously they would build the fastest planes possible , but since it took decades to design , approve , and then deliver a new type of plane , the generals thought it prudent to glimpse what futuristic technologies they should be funding .
So in 1953 the Air Force Office of Scientific Research plotted out the history of the fastest air vehicles .
The Wright Brothers ’ first flight reached 6.8 kph in 1903 , and jumped to 60 kph two years later .
The air speed record kept increasing a bit each year and in 1947 the fastest flight passed 1,000 kph in a Lockheed Shoot Star flown by Colonel Albert Boyd .
The record was broken four times in 1953 , ending with the F - 100 Super Sabre doing 1 , 215 kph .
Things were moving fast .
And everything was pointed towards space .
According to Damien Broderick , the author of “ The Spike ” , in 1953 the Air Force …
Charted the curves and metacurves of speed .
It told them something preposterous .
They could not believe their eyes .
The curve said they could have machines that attained orbital speed … within four years .
And they could get their payload right out of Earth ’s immediate gravity well just a little later .
They could have satellites almost at once , the curve insinuated , and if they wished — if they wanted to spend the money , and do the research and the engineering — they could go to the Moon quite soon after that .
It is important to remember that in 1953 none of the technology for these futuristic journeys existed .
No one knew how to do go that fast and survive .
Even the most optimistic die - hard visionaries did not expect a lunar landing any sooner than the proverbial “ Year 2000 . ”
The only voice telling them they could do it was a curve on a piece of paper .
But the curve was right .
Just not politically correct .
In 1957 the USSR launched Sputnik , right on schedule .
Then US rockets zipped to the Moon 12 years later .
As Brokderick notes , humans arrived on the Moon “ close to a third of century sooner than loony space travel buffs like Arthur C Clarke had expected it to occur . ”
What did the curve know that Arthur C Clarke did not ?
How did it account for the secretive efforts of the Russians as well as dozens of teams around the world ?
Was the curve a self - fulfilling prophesy , or a revelation of a trend rooted deep in the nature of the technium ?
The answer may lay in the many other trends plotted since then .
The most famous of them all is the trend known as Moore ’s Law .
In brief , Moore ’s Law predicts that computing chips shrink by half in size and cost every 18 - 24 months .
For the past 50 years it has been astoundingly correct .
This trend was first noticed in 1960 by Doug Englebart , a researcher at SRI in Palo Alto , California , who would later go on to invent the “ windows and mouse ” interface that is now ubiquitous on most computers .
When he first started as an engineer Englebart worked in the aerospace industry testing airplane models in wind tunnels where he learned how systematic scaling down led to all kinds of benefits and unexpected consequences .
The smaller the model , the easier to fly .
Englebart imagined how the benefits of scaling down , or as he called it “ similitude , ” might transfer to a new invention SRI was tracking — multiple transistors on one integrated silicon chip .
Perhaps as they were made smaller , circuits too might deliver a similar kind of similitude magic :
The smaller a chip , the better .
Englebart presented his ideas on similitude to an audience of engineers at the 1960 Solid State Circuits Conference that included Gordon Moore , a researcher at Fairchild Semiconductor .
In the following years Moore began tracking the actual statistics of the earliest prototype chips .
By 1964 he had enough data points to extrapolate the slope of the curve so far .
But as Moore recalls ,
I was not alone in making projections .
At a conference in New York City that same year [ 1964 ] , the IEEE convened a panel of executives from leading semiconductor companies : Texas Instruments , Motorola , Fairchild , General Electric , Zenith , and Westinghouse .
Several of the panelists made predictions about the semiconductor industry .
Patrick Haggerty of Texas Instruments , looking approximately ten years out , forecast that the industry would produce 750 million logic gates a year .
I thought that was perceptive but a huge number , and puzzled , “ Could we actually get to something like that ? ”
Harry Knowles from Westinghouse , who was considered the wild man of the group , said , “ We ’re going to get 250,000 logic gates on a single wafer . ”
At the time , my colleagues and I at Fairchild were struggling to produce just a handful .
We thought Knowles ’s prediction was ridiculous .
C. Lester Hogan of Motorola looked at expenses and said , “ The cost of a fully processed wafer will be $ 10 . ”
When you combine these predictions , they make a forecast for the entire semiconductor Industry [ for 1974 ] .
If Haggerty were on target , the industry would produce 750 million logic gates a year .
Using Knowles ’s “ wild ” figure of 250,000 logic gates per wafer meant that the industry would only use 3,000 wafers for this total output .
If Hogan was correct , and the cost per processed wafer was $ 10 , that would mean that the total manufacturing cost to produce the yearly output of the semiconductor industry would be $ 30,000 !
Somebody was wrong .
As it turned out , the person who was the “ most wrong ” was Haggerty , the panelist I considered the most perceptive .
His prediction of the number of logic gates that would be used turned out to be a ridiculously large underestimation .
On the other hand , the industry actually achieved what Knowles foresaw , while I had labeled his suggestion as the ridiculous one .
Even Hogan ’s forecast of $ 10 for a processed wafer was close to the mark , if you allow for inflation and make a cost - per - square - centimeter calculation .
The trends were telling them something no one else was , impossible as it seemed .
Moore kept adding data points as the semiconductor industry grew .
He was tracking all kinds of parameters — number of transistors made , cost per transistor , number of pins , logic speed , and components per wafer .
But one of them was cohering into a nice curve :
The number of components per chip .
In 1965 , at the invitation from the editor of the trade journal Electronics , Moore wrote a piece on “ the future of microelectronics . ”
In this short article he pointed out the curve of progress in chip fabrication is increasing by a exponential power every year .
As Moore noted in his internal memo to the Fairchild patent officers , he took current trend and “ extrapolated into the wild blue yonder . ”
But in fact , how far would it really go ?
Moore ’s original plot
Moore hooked up with Carver Mead , a fellow Caltech alumnus .
Mead was an electrical engineer and early transistor expert .
In 1967 Moore asked Mead what kind of theoretical limits were in store for microelectronic miniaturization .
Mead had no idea but as he did his calculations he made an amazing discovery :
The efficiency of the chip would increase by the cube of the scale ’s reduction .
The benefits from shrinking were “ exponential . ”
Microelectronics would not only become cheaper , they would also become better .
As Moore puts it “ By making things smaller , everything gets better simultaneously .
There is little need for tradeoffs .
The speed of our products goes up , the power consumption goes down , system reliability improves by leaps and bounds , but especially the cost of doing things drops as a result of the technology . ”
Carver Mead was so caught up in Moore ’s curves that he began to formalize them with physics equations and he named the trend Moore ’s Law .
He became an evangelist for the idea , traveling to electronics companies , the military , and academics preaching that the future of electronics lay in ever - smaller blocks of silicon , and trying to “ convince people that it really was possible to scale devices and get better performance and lower power ” — and that there was no end in sight for this trend .
“ Every time I ’d go out on the road , ” Mead recalls , “ I ’d come to Gordon and get a new version of his plot . ”
Today when we stare at the plot of Moore ’s Law we can spot several striking characteristics of its 50 year run .
The first surprise is that this is a picture of acceleration .
The straight line descending slope of the “ curve ” indicates a ten fold increase in goodness for every tick on vertical log axis .
Silicon computation is not simply getting better , but getting better faster .
Relentless acceleration for five decades is rare in biology and unknown in the technium before this century .
The explosion of good stuff is revealed in a line .
So this graph is as much about the phenomenon of cultural acceleration as about silicon chips .
In fact Moore ’s Law has come to represent the principle of an accelerating future which underpins our expectations of the technium : the world of the made gets better , faster .
Secondly , even a cursory glance reveals the astounding regularity of Moore ’s line .
From the earliest points its progress has been eerily mechanical .
Without interruption for 50 years , chips improve exponentially at the same speed of acceleration , neither more nor less .
It could not be more straight if it had been engineered by a technological tyrant .
Yet , we are to believe that this strict nonwavering trajectory came about via the chaos of the global marketplace and uncoordinated ruthless scientific competition .
The line is so straight and unambiguous that it seems curious anyone would need convincing by Moore and Mead to “ believe ” in it .
The question of faith lies in whether one believes the force of this “ law ” lies within the technology itself , or in a self - fulfilling social prophecy .
Is Moore ’s law inevitable , a direction pushed forward by the nature of matter and computation , and independent of the society it was born into , or is it an artifact of self - organized scientific and economic ambition ?
Moore and Mead themselves believe the latter .
Writing in 2005 , on the 40th anniversary of his law , Moore says , “ Moore ’s law is really about economics . ”
Carver Mead made it clearer yet : Moore ’s Law , he says , “ is really about people ’s belief system , it ’s not a law of physics , it ’s about human belief , and when people believe in something , they ’ll put energy behind it to make it come to pass . ”
In case that was not clear enough he spells it out further :
After [ it ] happened long enough , people begin to talk about it in retrospect , and in retrospect it ’s really a curve that goes through some points and so it looks like a physical law and people talk about it that way .
But actually if you ’re living it , which I am , then it does n’t feel like a physical law .
It ’s really a thing about human activity , it ’s about vision , it ’s about what you ’re allowed to believe .
Because people are really limited by their beliefs , they limit themselves by what they allow themselves to believe what is possible .
Finally , in a another reference , Mead adds : “ Permission to believe that [ the Law ] will keep going , ” is what keeps the Law going .
Moore agrees in a 1996 article : “ More than anything , once something like this gets established , it becomes more or less a self - fulfilling prophecy .
The Semiconductor Industry Association puts out a technology road map , which continues this [ generational improvement ] every three years .
Everyone in the industry recognizes that if you do n’t stay on essentially that curve they will fall behind .
So it sort of drives itself . ”
The ” technology road map ” produced by Semiconductor Industry Association in the 1990s was a major tool in cementing the role of Moore ’s law in chips and society .
According to David Brock , author of Understanding Moore ’s Law , the SIA road map “ transformed Moore ’s law from a prediction to a self - fulfilling prophecy .
It spelled out what needed to be accomplished , and when . ”
A major factor in semiconductor manufacturing process are the photoresist masks which craft the thin etched conducting wires on a chip .
The masks have to get smaller in order for the chip to get smaller .
Elsa Reichmanis is the foremost photoresist technical guru in Silicon Valley .
She says , “ Advances in the [ process ] technology today are largely driven by the Semiconductor Industry Association . ”
Raj Gupta , a materials scientist and CEO of Rohm and Haas , declares “ They ” — the SIA road map — “ say what performance they need [ for new electronic materials ] , and by which date . ”
Andrew Odlyzko from AT&T Bell Laboratories concurs : “ Management is * not* telling a researcher , ‘ You are the best we could find , here are the tools , please go off and find something that will let us leapfrog the competition . ’
Instead , the attitude is , ‘ Either you and your 999 colleagues double the performance of our microprocessors in the next 18 months , to keep up with the competition , or you are fired . ' ”
Gordon Moore reiterated the importance of SIA in a 2005 interview with Charlie Rose : “ the Semiconductor Industry Association put out a roadmap for the technology for the industry that took into account these exponential growths to see what research had to be done to make sure we could stay on that curve .
So it ’s kind of become a self - fulfilling prophecy . ”
Clearly , expectations of future progress guide current investments .
The inexorable curve of Moore ’s Law helps focus money and intelligence on very specific goals — keeping up with the Law .
The only problem with accepting these self - constructed goals as the source of such regular progress is that other technologies which might benefit from the same belief do not show the same zooming curve .
We witness steady , quantifiable progress in other solid state technologies such as solar photovoltaic panels — which are also made of silicon .
These have been sinking in performance price for two decades , but not exponentially .
Likewise the power density of batteries has been increasing steadily for two decades , not again , no where near the rate of computer chips .
Why do n’t we see Moore ’s Law type of growth in the performance of solar cells if this is simply a matter of believing in a self - fulfilling prophecy ?
Surely , such an acceleration would be ideal for investors and consumers .
Why does n’t everybody simply clap for Tinkerbelle to live , to * really * believe , and then the hoped for self - made fairy will kick in , and solar cells will double in efficiency and halve in cost every two years ?
That kind of consensual faith would generate billions of dollars .
It would easy to find entrepreneurs eager to genuinely believe in the prophecy .
The usual argument applied against this challenge is that solar chips and batteries are governed primarily by chemical processes , which chips are not .
As one expert put the failure of exponential growth in batteries : “ This is because battery technology is a prisoner of physics , the periodic table , manufacturing technology and economics . ”
That ’s plain wrong .
Manufacturing silicon integrated chips is an intensely chemical achievement , as much a prisoner of physics , the periodic table and manufacturing as batteries .
Mead admits this : “ It ’s a chemical process that makes integrated circuits , through and through . ”
In fact the main technical innovation of Silicon Valley chip fabrication was to employ the chemical industry to make electronics instead of chemicals .
Solar and batteries share the same chemical science as chips .
So what is the curve of Moore ’s law telling us that expert insiders do n’t see ?
That this steady acceleration is more than an agreement .
It originates within the technology .
There are other technologies , also solid state material science , that exhibit a steady curve of progress , and just like Moore ’s Law , their progress * is* exponential .
They too seem to obey a rough law of remarkably steady exponential improvement .
Consider the recent history ( for the last 10 - 15 years ) of the cost per performance of communication bandwidth , and digital storage .
The picture of their exponential growth parallels the integrated circuit in every way except their slope — the rate at which they are speeding up .
Why is the doubling period in one technology eight years versus two ?
Is n’t the same finance system and expectations underpinning them ?
Except for the slope , these graphs are so similar , in fact , that it is fair to ask whether these curves are just reflections of Moore ’s Law .
Telephones are heavily computerized and storage discs are organs of computers .
Since progress in speed and cheapness of bandwidth , and storage capacity , relies directly and indirectly on accelerating computing power , it may be impossible to untangle the destiny of bandwidth and storage from computer chips .
Perhaps the curves of bandwidth and storage are simply derivatives of the one uber Law ?
Without Moore ’s Law ticking beneath them , would they even remain solvent ?
Consider another encapsulation of accelerating progress .
For a decade or so biophysicist Rob Carlson has been tabulating progress in DNA sequencing and synthesis .
Graphed similarly to Moore ’s Law ( above ) , in cost performance per base pair , this technology too displays a steady drop when plotted on a log axis .
I asked Carlson how much of this gain is due to Moore ’s Law .
If computers did not get better , faster , cheaper each year , would DNA sequencing and synthesis continue to accelerate ?
Carlson replied :
Most of the fall in costs of sequencing and synthesis have to do with parallelization , new methods , and falling costs for reagents .
Moore ’s law must have had some effect through cheap hardware that enables desktop CAD , but that is fairly tangential .
If Moore ’s Law stopped , I do n’t think it would have much effect .
The one area it might affect is processing the raw sequence information into something comprehensible by humans .
Crunching the data of DNA is at least as expensive as getting the sequence of the physical DNA .
Larry Roberts , the principal architect of the ARPANET , the early internet , keeps detailed stats on communication improvements .
He has noticed that communication technology in general also exhibits a Moore ’s Law - like rise in quality .
Might progress in wires also be correlated to progress in chips ?
Roberts says that the performance of communication technology “ is strongly influenced by and very similar to Moore ’s Law but not identical as might be expected . ”
In the inner-circle of the tech industry the fast - paced drop in prices for magnetic storage is called Kryder ’s Law .
It ’s the Moore ’s Law for computer storage and is named after Mark Kryder the chief technical officer of Seagate , a major manufacturer of hard disks .
Kryder ’s
Law says that the cost / performance of hard disks is increasing exponentially at a steady rate of 40 % per year .
I asked Kryder the same question : is Kryders ’ Law dependent upon Moore ’s Law .
If computers did not get better , cheaper every year , would storage continue to do so ?
Kryder responded : “ This is no direct relationship between Moore ’s law and Kryder ’s law .
The physics and fabrication processes are different for the semiconductor devices and magnetic storage .
Hence , it is quite possible that semiconductor scaling could stop while scaling of disk drives continues .
In fact , I believe that Flash [ silicon chip - based storage such as memory cards and thumb drives ] will hit a barrier well before hard drives do . ”
Of course , if computers were to cease getting more powerful , the need for extra storage or faster communications would also slow down .
So indirect market forces entwine the Laws , but only to a secondary degree .
Andrew Odlyzko , who now studies the growth of internet at the University of Minnesota , says , “ I would say Moore ’s laws in their various disciplines are highly correlated and synergistic , drawing on the same pool of basic science and technology .
It is hard ( but not impossible ) to imagine that if improvements in transistor density ceased , then photonics or wireless could progress for long . ”
While expectations can certainly guide technological progress , consistent law - like improvement must be more than self - fulfilling prophesy .
For one thing , this obedience to a curve often begins long before anyone notices there is a law , and way before anyone would be able to influence it .
The exponential growth of magnetic storage began in 1956 , almost a whole decade before Moore formulated his law for semiconductors and 50 years before Kryder formulized its existence .
Rob Carlson says , “ When I first published the DNA exponential curves , I got reviewers claiming that they were unaware of any evidence that sequencing costs were falling exponentially .
In this way the trends were operative even when people disbelieved it . ”
Ray Kurzweil dug into the archives to show that something like Moore ’s Law had it origins as far back as 1900 , long before electronic computers existed , and of course long before the path could have been constructed by self - fulfillment .
Kurzweil estimated the number of “ calculations per second per $ 1,000 ″ performed by turn - of - the - century analog machines , by mechanical calculators , and later by the first vacuum tube computers and extended the same calculation to modern semiconductor chips .
He established that this ratio increased exponentially for the past 109 years .
More importantly , the curve ( let ’s call it Kurzweil ’s Law ) transects five different technological species of computation : electromechanical , relay , vacuum tube , transistors and integrated circuits .
An unobserved constant operating in five distinct paradigms of technology for over a century must be more than an industry road map .
It suggest that the nature of these ratios are baked deep into the fabric of the technium .
But in every contemporary case — DNA sequencing , magnetic storage , semiconductors , bandwidth , pixel density — once a fixed curve is revealed , scientists , investors , marketing , and journalists all grab hold of it and use it to guide experiments , investments , schedules and publicity .
The map becomes the territory .
There is no doubt curves are used as tools , and that they can sway the rate of progress .
Moore tells one story : “ When the industry fully recognized that we were truly on a pace of a new - process - technology - generation - every - three - years , we started to shift to a new - generation - every - two - years to get a bit ahead of the competition .
We changed the slope . ”
For three and a half decades , from 1956 to 1991 , IBM set the pace on improvements in the density of hard disk drives to about 25 % per year .
That ’s just below the rate of semiconductor progress .
IBM owned the patents and this rate allowed them to comfortably maintain high profit margins .
But in the early 1980s , many competitors sprang up making smaller disks which had lower densities .
But their densities were improving must faster than IBM ’s schedule .
So in 1990 , IBM changed the slope .
They mandated that henceforth their improvement would be 60 % a year .
This spurred an escalation of R&D investment , faster growth by the competitors , and more R&D by IBM so that by the late 1990s onward , the slope of growth increased to more than 100 % per year .
The slope of progress can be changed by pouring money down it .
Mark Kryder says , “ My guess is that you could double the density growth rate with something less than the double the R&D dollars . ”
The slope can also be changed by regulations .
Larry Roberts offers this evidence for the effects of the US Telecommunications Act of 1993 .
“ From before 1960 until de-regulation about 1993 , the cost per terabit of communications [ red line in the graph below ; the blue is Moore ’s Law ] dropped very slowly , halving every 79 months .
Then , once fiber was in place , DWDM and free enterprise took the market price down fast , halving every 12 months . ”
Since the rate of these explosions of innovation can be varied to some degree by applying money or laws , their trend lines cannot be fully inherent in the material itself .
At the same time , since these curves begin and advance independent of our awareness , and do not waver from a straight line under enormous competition and investment pressures , their course must in some way be bound to the materials .
If you scour the technium for examples of enduring exponential progress , you ’ll find most candidates within fields related to material science .
For instance the maximum rotational speed of an electric motor is not following an exponential curve .
Nor is the maximum miles - per - gallon performance of an automobile engine .
In fact most technical progress is not exponential , nor steady .
Even most progress in material science is not exponential .
We are not exponentially increasing the hardness of steel .
Nor are we exponentially increasing the percentage yield of say , sulfuric acid , or petroleum distillates , from their precursors .
I gathered as many examples of current exponential progress as I could find .
I was not seeking examples where the total quantity produced ( watts , kilometers , bits , basepairs , traffic , etc ) were rising exponentially since these quantities are skewed by our rising populations .
More people use more stuff , even if it is not improving .
Rather I looked for examples that showed performance ratios ( such as pounds per inch , illumination per dollar ) steadily increasing if not accelerating .
Here is a set of quickly found examples , and the rate at which their performance is doubling .
( This will display as halving the time . )
Doubling Times of Various Technological Performance in Months
The first thing to notice is that all these examples demonstrate the effects of scaling down , or working with the small .
In this microcosmic realm energy is not very important .
We do n’t see exponential improvement in efforts to scale up , to keep getting bigger , skyscrapers and space stations .
Airplanes are n’t getting bigger , flying faster , and more fuel efficient at an exponential rate .
Gordon Moore jokes that if the technology of air travel experienced the same kind of progress as Intel chips , a modern day commercial aircraft would cost $ 500 , circle the earth in 20 minutes , and only use five gallons of fuel for the trip .
However , the plane would only be the size of a shoebox !
We do n’t see a Moore ’s Law - type of progress at work while scaling up because energy needs scale up just as fast , and energy is a major limited constraint , unlike information .
So our entire new economy is built around technologies that scale down well — photons , electrons , bits , pixels , frequencies , and genes .
As these inventions miniaturize , they reach closer to bare atoms , raw bits , and the essence of matter and information .
And so the fixed and inevitable path of their progress derives from this elemental essence .
The second thing to notice about this set of examples is the narrow range of slopes , or doubling time ( in months ) .
The particular power being optimized in these technologies is doubling between 8 and 30 months .
Everyone of them is getting twice as better every year or two no matter the technology .
What ’s up with that ?
Engineer Mark Kryder ’s explanation is that this “ twice as better every two years ” is an artifact of corporate structure where most of these inventions happen .
It just takes 1 - 2 years of calendar time to conceive , design , prototype , test , manufacture and market a new improvement , and while a 5 - or 10 - fold increase is very difficult to achieve , almost any engineer can deliver a factor of two .
Voila !
Twice as better every two years .
Engineers unleashed equals Moore ’s Law .
But , as mentioned earlier , we see engineers unleashed in other departments of the technium without the appearance of exponential growth .
And in fact not every aspect of semiconductor extrapolation resolves into a handy “ law . ”
Moore recalls that in a 1975 speech he forecasted the expected growth of other attributes of silicon chips “ just to demonstrate how ridiculous it is to extrapolate exponentials . ”
Extrapolating the maximum size of the wafer of silicon used to grow the chips ( which was increasing as fast of the number of components ) he calculated would yield a nearly 2 - meter ( 6 - foot ) diameter crystal by 2000 , which just seemed unlikely .
That did not happen ; they reached 300 mm ( 1 foot ) .
And as small as those differences in slopes are , say , between the 21 - month doubling increase in power of a CPU processor , and the 16 - month doubling increase in density of RAM storage , that gap is significant .
Curiously , the difference between two exponential curves is itself an exponential growth .
That means that over time , the performance of two technologies under that same financial regime , the same engineering society , the same technium , are diverging at an exponential rate .
Clearly , this ever widening gap is due to an intrinsic quality of the technologies .
Should we ever arrive on other inhabited worlds in our galaxy , we should expect some of them to have reached the stage of microelectronics in their own technium .
Once they discover the application of binary logic to microcircuits , they too will experience a version of Moore ’s Law .
The lessons of the microcosm will play out its inevitable course : as circuits get smaller , they get faster , more accurate , and cheaper .
Their alien computers will quickly get better and more affordable at once , which in turn will propel innumerable other technological explosions to their great delight .
Whenever it begins the steady acceleration of progress in solid - state computation should last for at least 25 doublings ( what we ’ve experienced so far ) , or a 33 million - fold increase in value .
But while Moore ’s Law is inevitable in its progression , its slope is not .
The slant of increase in a particular world may indeed be a matter of macro-economics .
Here Moore and Mead may be correct : the slope of the Law rests on economics .
Whether computing power doubles every month or every decade will depend on many factors of that particular society : population size , volume of the economy , velocity of money , evolution of financial instruments .
The constant speed of discovery might hinge in part on the total available pool of engineers , whether it is 10 thousand versus 10 million .
A faster planetary velocity of money may permit a faster doubling period .
All these economic factors combine to produce a fixed constant for that world at that phase .
If Moore ’s Law turned out to be a universal fixture in the computational phase of civilization , this fixed constant might even be used as a classification marker .
Hypothetical civilizations are currently classified by their energy use .
The Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev specified that a class I civilization would leverage its home planet ’s energy , a class II its star ’s , and class III civilization its galaxy ’s energy .
In a Moore ’s Slope scheme , a class I civilization would exhibit a chip - power doubling rate measured in “ days , ” while a class II civilization would show doublings measured in days squared , and class III in days cubed , and so on .
In any case , at some point on our planet , or any planet , the curve will plateau out .
Moore ’s law will not continue forever .
Any specific exponential growth will inevitably smooth out into a typical S - shaped curve .
This is the archetypical pattern of growth : after a slow ramp up , gains takeoff straight up like a rocket , and then after a long run level out slowly .
Back in 1830 only 37 kilometers of railroad track had been laid in the US .
That count doubled in the next ten years , and then doubled in the decade after that , and kept doubling every decade for 60 years .
In 1890 any reasonable railroad buff would have predicted that the US would have hundreds of millions of kilometers of railroad by a hundred years later .
There would be railroad to everyone ’s house .
Instead there were fewer than 400,000 kilometers .
However , Americans did not cease to be mobile .
We merely shifted our mobility and transportation to other species of invention .
We built automobile highways , and airports .
The miles we travel keep expanding , but the exponential growth of that particular technology peaked and plateau .
Much of the churn in the technium is due to our tendency to shift what we care about .
Mastering one technology engenders new technological desires .
A recent example :
The first digital cameras had very rough picture resolution .
Then scientists began cramming more and more pixels onto one sensor to increase photo quality .
Before they knew it , the number of pixels possible per array was on an exponential curve , heading into megapixel territory and beyond .
But after a decade of acceleration , consumers shrugged off the increasing number of pixels ; the current resolution was sufficient .
Their concern shifted to the speed of the pixel sensors , or the response in low light — things no one cared about before .
So a new metric is born , and a new curve started , and the exponential curve of ever - more pixels per array will gradually abate .
Moore ’s Law is headed to a similar fate .
When , no one knows .
“ Moore ’s Law , which has held as the benchmark for IC scaling for more than 40 years , will cease to drive semiconductor manufacturing after 2014 , ” Len Jelinek , the director of a major semiconductor manufacturer , claimed in 2009 .
Carl Anderson , an IBM Fellow , announced at an industry conference in April , 2009 that the end of Moore ’s Law was at hand : “ There was exponential growth in the railroad industry in the 1800s ; there was exponential growth in the automobile industry in the 1930s and 1940s ; and there was exponential growth in the performance of aircraft until they reached the speed of sound .
But eventually exponential growth always comes to an end . ”
But IBM has been wrong several times before .
In 1978 , IBM scientists predicted Moore ’s Law had only 10 years left .
Whoops .
In 1988 , they again said it would end in 10 years .
Ooops , again .
Gordon Moore himself predicted his law would end when it reach 250 nanometer manufacturing , which it passed in 1997 .
Today the industry is aiming for 20 nanometers .
In 2009 , Intel CEO Craig Barrett said “ We can scale it down another 10 to 15 years .
Nothing touches the economics of it . ”
Whether Moore ’s Law — as the count of transistor density — has one , two , or three decades left to zoom and drive our economy , we can be sure it will peter out as other past trends have by being sublimated into another rising trend .
When we reach the limits of miniaturization , and can no longer cram more circuits on one chip , we can just make the chip bigger ( that ’s Moore ’s suggestion ! ) .
Carl Anderson of IBM cites three next - generation technologies that are candidates for the next round of exponential growth : piling transistors on top of each other ( known as 3 - D chips ) , optical computers , or making existing circuits work faster ( accelerators ) .
And then there is parallel processing using many core processors at once , lots of chips connected in parallel .
In other words , maybe we do n’t need more and more transistors on one chip .
Maybe we need re-arrangements of the bits we have .
We may consider ourselves to be a million times cleverer than a monkey , but we do n’t have a million times as many genes , or a million times as many neurons .
Our gene and neuron count is almost identical with all apes .
The evolutionary growth in those trends stopped with Sapiens ( us ) , and switched to increasing other factors .
As Moore ’s Law abates , we ’ll find alternative solutions to making a million times more transistors .
In fact , we may already have enough transistors per chip to do what we want , if only we knew how .
Moore began by measuring the number of “ components ” per square inch , then switched to transistors , and now we measure transistors per dollar .
As one exponential trend ( say , the density of transistors ) decelerates , we begin caring about a new parameter ( say , speed of operations , or number of connections ) and so we begin measuring a new metric , and plotting a new graph .
Suddenly , another “ law ” is revealed .
As the character of this new technique is studied , exploited and optimized , its natural pace is revealed , and when this trajectory is extrapolated , it becomes the creators ’ goal .
In the case of computing , this newly realized attribute of microprocessors will become , over time , the new Moore ’s Law .
Like the Air Force ’s 1953 graph of top - speed , the curve is one way the technium speaks to us .
Carver Mead , who barnstormed the country waving plots of Moore ’s Law , believes we need to “ listen to the technology . ”
As one curve inevitably flattens out , its momentum is taken up by anther S - curve .
If we inspect any enduring curve closely we can see how definitions and metrics shift over time to accommodate new substitute technologies .
For instance , a close scrutiny of Kryder ’s Law in hard disk densities shows that it is composed of a sequence of overlapping smaller trendlines .
These may have slightly different slopes , but in aggregate , calibrated with an appropriate common metric , they yield the unwavering trajectory .
This cartoon graph dissects what is happening .
A stack of s-curves , each one containing their own limited run of exponential growth , overlap to produce a long - run emergent exponential growth line .
The trend bridges more than one technology , giving it a transcendent power .
As one exponential boom is subsumed into the next boom , an established technology relays its momentum to the next paradigm , and carries forward an unrelenting growth .
The performance is measure at a higher emergent level , not seen at first in the specific technologies .
It reveals itself as a long - term trans - technium benefit , a macro trend that continues indefinitely .
In this way Moore ’s Law — redefined — will never end .
But while the slow demise of the transistor trend is inevitable , if the larger meta version of all the related Moore ’s Laws — increasing , cheaper computer / internet power — were to suddenly cease on Earth in the next few years , it would be disastrous .
These performance ratios roughly double ( or half ) 50 % annually .
That means things we care about get better by half as much every year .
Imagine if you got half - again smarter every year , or remember half as much more this year as last .
Embedded deep in the technium ( as we no know it ) is the remarkable capacity of half - again annual improvement .
The optimism of our age rests on the reliable advance of Moore ’s promise : that stuff will get significantly , seriously , desirably better and cheaper tomorrow .
If the things we make will get better the next time , that means that the Golden Age is ahead of us , and not in the past .
With the meta Moore ’s Law out of action , half or more of the optimism of our time would vanish .
But even if it we wanted to , what on earth could derail Moore ’s law ?
Suppose we were part of a vast conspiracy to halt Moore ’s Law .
Maybe we believed it artificially elevates undue optimism and encourages misguided expectations of a Singularity .
What could we do ?
How would you stop it ?
Those who believe its powers rests primarily in its self - reinforced expectations would say : simply announce it will end .
If enough smart believers circulate declaring Moore ’s Law is over , then it will be over .
The loop of self - fulfilling prophecy would be broken .
But all it takes in one maverick to push ahead and make further progress , and the spell would be broken .
The race would resume until the physics of scaling down gave out .
More clever folk might reason that since the economic regime as a whole determines the slope of Moore ’s Law , you could keep decreasing the quality of the economy until it stopped .
Perhaps through armed revolution , you installed an authoritative command - style policy ( like the old state - communisms ) , whose lackadaisical economic growth killed the infrastructure for exponential increases in computing power .
I find that possibility intriguing , but I have my doubts .
If , in a counterfactual history , communism had won the cold war , and microelectronics were invented in a global Soviet style society , my guess is that even that alternative policy could not stifle Moore ’s Law .
Progress might roll out slower , but I do n’t doubt Stalinist scientists would tap into the law of the microcosm , and soon marvel at the same technical wonder we do : chips improving exponentially as constant linear effort is applied .
I suspect Moore ’s Law is something we do n’t have much sway over , other than its doubling period .
Moore ’s Law is the Moira of our age .
In Greek mythology the Moira were the three Fates .
Usually depicted as dour spinsters , one Moira spun the thread of a newborn ’s life .
The other Moira counted out the thread ’s length .
And the third Moira cut the thread at death .
A person ’s beginning and end were predetermined .
But what happened in between was not inevitable .
Humans and gods could work within the confines of one ’s ultimate destiny .
According to legend , Dionysos , the god of wine and parties , was unable to cry .
But he loved a woodspirit , a half - satyr named Ampelos , who was killed by a wild bull .
Dionysos was so stricken by Ampelos ’ death that he finally wept .
So to appease Dionysos ’ unexpected grief , the Moira transformed Ampelos into the first grapevine .
Then according to the bards , “ the inflexible threads of Moira were unloosened and turned back . ”
Ampelos ’ blood became the wine that Dionysos loved .
Fate was obeyed , yet Dionysos get what he choose .
Within the inexorable flow of larger trends our freewill flits , moving us in tandem with destiny .
The unbending trajectories uncovered by Moore , Kryder , Gilder , and Kurzweil spin through the technium forming a long thread .
The thrust of the thread is inevitable , its course destined by the nature of matter and discovery .
Once untied , the thread of Moore ’s Law will unravel steadily , inexorably towards its anchor at the bottom of physics .
Along the way it unleashes other threads of technology we might wish to pull .
Each of those threads , of Communication , Bandwidth , Storage , will unravel in its predetermined manner as well .
We choose how fast to unzip them , and which ones to unloosen next .
Collectively we push and pull with exceeding energy to wrench the threads from their place , but our efforts only serve to unravel it as it would anyway .
The technium holds our Moira , and the Moira play out our inflexible threads .
Like Dionysos we can unloosen , but not remove them .
Listen to the technology , Carver Mead says .
What do the curves say ?
Imagine it is 1965 .
You ’ve seen the curves Gordon Moore discovered .
What if you believed the story they were trying to tell us : that each year , as sure as winter follows summer , and day follows night , computers would get half again better , and half again smaller , and half again cheaper , year after year , and that in 5 decades they would be 30 million times more powerful than they were then , and cheap .
If you were sure of that back then , or even mostly persuaded , and if a lot of others were as well , what good fortune you could have harvested .
You would have needed no other prophecies , no other predictions , no other details .
Just knowing that single trajectory of Moore ’s , and none other , we would have educated differently , invested differently , prepared more wisely to grasp the amazing powers it would sprout .
Moore ’s Law is one of the few Moira threads we ’ve teased out in our short history in the technium .
There must be others .
Most of the technium ’s predetermined developments remain hidden , not yet uncovered , by tools not yet invented .
But we ’ve learned to look for them .
Searching , we can see similar laws peeking out now .
These “ laws ” are reflexes of the technium that kick in regardless of the social climate .
They too will spawn progress , and inspire new powers and new desires as they unroll in ordered sequence .
Perhaps these self - governing dynamics will appear in genetics , or in pharmaceuticals , or in cognition .
Once a dynamic like Moore ’s Law is launched and made visible , the fuels of finance , competition , and markets will push the law to its limits and keep it riding along that curve until it has consumed its physical potential .
Our choice , and it is significant , is to prepare for the gift — and the problems it will also bring .
We can choose to get better at anticipating these inevitable surges .
We can choose to educate ourselves and children to become smartly literate and wise in their use .
And we can choose to modify our legal / political / economic assumptions to meet the ordained evolution ahead .
But we can not escape from them .
When we spy our technological fate in the distance we should not reel back in horror of its inevitability ; rather we should lurch forward in preparation .
Six companies controlled by one of the country 's largest property developers , Liam Carroll , have lost their bid to have an examiner appointed to them by the High Court .
More detail here
At the Commercial Court his afternoon , Mr Justice Peter Kelly said he was refusing the application on the basis that he was not convinced that the companies had proven that they met the legal test of having a reasonable prospect of survival .
However while expressing some misgivings , the Judge did grant a stay on his decision until Tuesday so that the companies could lodge an appeal with the Supreme Court before a receiver were appointed .
Vantive Holdings , Jersey - based Morston Investments , and four other companies in Liam Carroll 's Zoe Group , sought court protection , after ACC Bank began proceedings to have them wound up over € 136 m of unpaid debts .
But Mr Justice Kelly said he had the gravest reservations about the projections put forward in their application , which he said were devoid of reality .
He said their plans to turn insolvency into a €300 m surplus in three years would involve a remarkable turnaround .
Given market conditions and little or no prospect of them improving in the foreseeable future , he said , this degree of optimism borders or even trespasses on the fanciful .
He criticised inaccuracies contained in the independent accountants report submitted with the application , which he said was written by the companies ' auditor , and contained old valuations carried out by firms who had worked for the companies in the past .
He said that while most of the companies banks were supporting them , the truth was they could probably do little else but show forbearance , or risk collapsing the house of cards .
He also expressed the belief that the application was in reality an exercise to assist shareholders whose investments had been unsuccessful .
Counsel representing the companies sought a stay to allow the companies time to consider an appeal to the Supreme Court .
Mr Justice Kelly said it was unclear whether there was a legal basis for such a move , but after considering the matter granted a stay until Tuesday .
agedu
a Unix utility for tracking down wasted disk space
Introduction
Suppose you 're running low on disk space .
You need to free some up , by finding something that 's a waste of space and deleting it ( or moving it to an archive medium ) .
How do you find the right stuff to delete , that saves you the maximum space at the cost of minimum inconvenience ?
Unix provides the standard du utility , which scans your disk and tells you which directories contain the largest amounts of data .
That can help you narrow your search to the things most worth deleting .
However , that only tells you what 's big .
What you really want to know is what 's too big .
By itself , du wo n't let you distinguish between data that 's big because you 're doing something that needs it to be big , and data that 's big because you unpacked it once and forgot about it .
Most Unix file systems , in their default mode , helpfully record when a file was last accessed .
Not just when it was written or modified , but when it was even read .
So if you generated a large amount of data years ago , forgot to clean it up , and have never used it since , then it ought in principle to be possible to use those last - access time stamps to tell the difference between that and a large amount of data you 're still using regularly .
agedu is a program which does this .
It does basically the same sort of disk scan as du , but it also records the last - access times of everything it scans .
Then it builds an index that lets it efficiently generate reports giving a summary of the results for each subdirectory , and then it produces those reports on demand .
Screenshot
The best way to explain what agedu does is to show it in action .
Here 's a screenshot of an HTML report generated by agedu after scanning my home directory , and served to my web browser :
You can see here a big coloured bar representing all the space used in and below the main directory I 'm looking at , and then smaller bars showing how much of that space is in each subdirectory .
Each coloured bar is drawn in lots of different colours : red represents data that has n't been looked at for a long time , green represents very recently accessed data , and the spectrum through orange and yellow represents points in between .
So I can immediately see that the gdk subdirectory is not only the largest , but also that it consists mostly of data I have n't looked at in about seven months , making it a key candidate for tidying up .
By contrast , the next two directories ( bash and glibc ) contain very little wasted space ; the one below that , tex , is a stronger tidying - up candidate than either .
You can see in the screenshot that all the subdirectory names , and some components of the pathname at the top , are hyperlinks .
Each one goes to a page centred on a different directory , with that directory 's coloured bar expanded to fill the width of the window and all of its subdirectories displayed below it in the same way .
Using this , I can browse around my entire home directory until I 've identified where the real wastes of space are .
( Of course , I might find a large collection of data which is only accessed once a year but I do still need to keep it in order to carry on accessing it once a year .
agedu can't magically find data that 's definitely wasted .
All it can do is tell you where are good places to look ; it just does that one notch better than du . )
Details
As well as generating graphical reports like the one shown above , agedu can also produce text output a bit like du ( but with the additional feature of being able to show only the disk space used by long - disused files , for any age cutoff you like ) .
For complete and excruciating detail , you can read the man page online .
Windows
agedu itself does not have a native Windows port ( although one user reported that it at least built in Cygwin ) .
However , I do have a small Windows utility , which will scan a Windows system and produce a dump file suitable for loading into agedu , so if you have a Unix machine available as well as Windows then you can use agedu that way .
The utility is called ageduscan.exe .
It produces a log file on standard output , so you will probably want to run a command like " ageduscan c:\ > scan.dat " , or just " ageduscan > scan.dat " to scan the current directory .
Then copy the output file ( scan .dat in these examples ) to a Unix machine where you can run agedu itself , and load it in using the - L option ( see the man page ) .
Status of agedu
agedu works for me and has had a small amount of beta testing .
I 'd be interested to hear from anyone using it on particularly large amounts of data ( say , an order of magnitude or so larger than a home Linux box ) .
Licence
agedu is distributed under the MIT licence , so it is free to copy , redistribute , use and reuse .
For more details , see the file called LICENCE in the distribution archive .
Download
A Unix source archive of agedu is available here :
The Windows scan - only utility ( see above ) is here :
If you want to see the latest state of development , you can check the development sources out from my git repository :
git clone https://git.tartarus.org/simon/agedu.git
Alternatively , you can browse the repository on the web , here .
Here 's a brief article describing the data structure used in agedu 's index .
Is it pronounced ‘ agadoo ’ ?
If you insist , I wo n't stop you , but I pronounce it ‘ age dee you ’ .
( Somehow , this program managed to acquire a FAQ before it was even published . )

When I think of summer , I think of vocation 🙂 and when I start dreaming of vocation I see beautiful sunny islands , with golden beaches , tanned bodies , warm ocean water and a cocktail with mint .
This sounds so delicious !
Being inspired with these dreams I decided to make a photostream of the most beautiful islands I could found .
I did n’t use any comparison lists to choose the best of them , I have just found about 35 or so islands loved by tourists , reviewed about 10 photos of each of them and have chosen those those that reminded me of the island in my dreams .
So if you ’ve been on some other island that should be added to this list and have some “ hot ” photos let me know , and I ’ll add it to our collection .
So here we go !

As most fans of the series will tell you , there ’s just something magical about Gunbuster .
Also known as Aim for the Ace ! , Gunbuster was a six episode OVA released by the mostly unknown Gainax in 1988 .
The show also marked the directorial debut of Hideaki Anno , who ’d go on to create other fascinating shows like Evangelion .
True to that form , Gunbuster is also a series where the robots and monsters are merely the pretense to show kids growing up / dealing with their problems .
Among them , is Jung Freud , my favorite Soviet .
The level of ridiculousness and overkill intrinsic to Gunbuster is reason enough to check it out .
“ Space monsters , ” a mass of nearly unstoppable , endless swarm of insects are slowly making their way to Earth .
Humanity seems outclassed by this destructive swarm , but Luckily , due to the somewhat accurate portrayal of space travel , we have decades to prepare for them .
Since it will take them that long to get here , humanity has placed almost all of its resources toward training the pilots who will be around to fight them … viola , there ’s the “ plot ” of Gunbuster .
The real plot centers around a coming of age story skewed by temporal distortions .
Using actual science ( wow ! ) the show put into practice that traveling faster than the speed of light slows the rate at which time proceeds .
The main character becomes unhinged from the regular flow of her human life , since her missions take years to perform , yet only days / weeks for her .
After one mission she became closer in age to her friends daughter than the friend herself .
The gripping emotional turmoil of a character whom has no anchor in reality is quite enthralling .
But what about the Soviets ?
Though more of a tertiary character , the series quickly introduces the genius rival of the protagonist , Jung Freud .
An obvious nod to the psychologist ’s Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung , “ Jung Freud ” also hails from the Soviet Union .
Okay , I ’m going to stop and explain how novel this is to me .
Watching this series on degraded VHS tapes in the year 2000 , it was hard for me to wrap my head around the concept of the Soviet Union , let alone it continuing on for another half a century .
Imagine my surprise when Freud is actually more than fanservice wrapped in a stereotype , but is a respected and fleshed out character .
Her own foibles played in fast foward , we see the image of a woman whom just “ happens ” to be unabashedly Soviet .
Back in the wondrous year of 1988 , the literature reflected a society capable of projecting respect on a now defunct concept / country .
Fun factoid , Jung Freud is also seen as the prototype for more well known Asuka Langley Soryu .
Though , for the record , I ’d choose Jung over Asuka any day .
Too much baggage in my opinion .
Jung Freud ’s positive points
1 ) A serious Soviet , no matter how fanservice she performs
2 ) Predecessor to themes and characters in Evangelion
3 ) Helped pioneer the “ Gainax bounce ”
4 ) Goes from jerk , to rival , to best friend in two episodes ( cuts out a lot of the not fun parts )
5 ) Gives you a reason to say “ Jung ” and “ Freud ” more often

The pilot of Continental Flight 61 died Thursday as the plane flew from Brussels , Belgium , to Newark , New Jersey , the Federal Aviation Administration and Continental Airlines said .
Pilot Craig Lenell is shown with daughter Jennifer Lenell - Small , a former Continental employee .
The 60 - year - old Newark - based pilot died of " apparently of natural causes " about halfway through the flight , the airline said .
He had 32 years of service with Continental , it said .
The pilot 's family identified him to CNN as Craig Lenell .
The airline said the crew on the flight included an additional relief pilot who took the place of the deceased man , and " the flight continued safely with two pilots at the controls . "
The Boeing 777 landed safely at Newark International Airport at 11:49 a.m. ET
Thursday , the airline said .
No further details were given .
Continental did not release the pilot 's name .
Asked whether the plane 's 247 passengers had been told of the situation , a Continental spokesman said only that the plane had arrived safely .
Passengers told CNN that they were not informed , and that the only indication of a problem was that an announcement for a doctor was made during the flight .

" I have n't heard anything . " passenger Chris Balchuas , from Houston , Texas , told reporters after the flight .
" They just said there was a medical emergency and were there any doctors aboard . "
Another passenger , Dr. Julien Struyzen , said he responded to the request for a doctor and pronounced the pilot dead .
" He was clinically dead when I came in , " Struyzen said .
Flight personnel asked him if anything was possible , and he said " it was not . "
He did not give additional details .
Struyzen said all flight personnel were " very professional . "

Balchuas , after being told what had happened , said , " Oh , that 's scary .
I did n't know anything about that . "
He said nothing was unusual about the flight , just that about " four or five fire trucks and a whole bunch of medical emergency teams " met the plane when it landed .
Steve Coleman , a spokesman for the New York and New Jersey Port Authority , said the FAA told Newark airport officials to have emergency crews standing by for the landing .

Lightning is the weapon of choice for discerning deities .
Whether you 're Zeus , Thor or Tlaloc , there 's no better way to assert your authority than smiting humans with thunderbolts .
Many people saw lightning this way for thousands of years , like a shock collar from the gods .
The idea still comes up when someone says " may God strike me dead " to support a claim , and although scientists have learned a lot about weather and electricity in the past few millennia , lightning and other atmospheric electricity remains shrouded in mystery .
Here 's a rough look at what we do know .
How lightning works
As a summer thunderstorm soars over the landscape , it fuels itself by vacuuming up warm , moist air below .
Known as " updrafts , " these vertical gusts create the storm cloud and stir up the turbulent environment inside it where lightning is born .
Updrafts carry water droplets high into a thunderstorm , where they condense into clouds at the cooler altitudes around its peak .
If there 's enough humidity underneath the storm , it might billow into a towering monstrosity , launching some water droplets as high as 70,000 feet , miles above the freezing level .
When these droplets freeze and fall back down , they collide with warmer droplets on the way , freezing them and releasing their heat .
This heat keeps the surface of the falling ice slightly warmer than its surroundings , turning it into a soft hail known as graupel .
Although scientists still do n't know how clouds generate the electrical charge needed for a lightning strike , many believe graupel is to blame .
When it starts churning around the thunderstorm and crashing into other water droplets or ice particles , an odd thing happens : Electrons are sheared off the rising particles and collect on the falling ones .
Since electrons are negatively charged , this leads to a cloud with a negative base and a positive top — like a battery .
Unlike a battery , however , the cloud 's electrical field is constantly being recharged by updrafts , which also continue stacking the storm taller and taller , pushing its positive top farther from its negative base .
Needless to say , this can't last .
Nature abhors a vacuum , but she 's no fan of electrical fields , either , usually releasing their energy any chance she gets .
Still , Earth 's atmosphere is a good insulator , so superpowerful charges must build up to a certain threshold before they can overwhelm the air .
When that eventually happens , the resulting lightning strike can carry 100 million to 1 billion volts .
Lightning 's first spark is a ghostly streak of electricity known as a " stepped leader , " which begins forcing its way through the air in 50 - yard bursts , looking for the path of least resistance between one charged region and the other .
Once it connects with the opposite region 's most convenient point , a glowing return stroke blasts back along the same path at 60,000 miles per second .
A flash consists of one or up to 20 return strokes along the same lightning channel — usually about 1 to 2 inches in diameter — but it all happens faster than you can say greased lightning .
Unless , of course , you watch it in " super duper slow motion " like this :
How thunder works
Thunder is the sound made by lightning .
Specifically , it 's the sound made by gases in the air exploding as lightning heats them to about 20,000 degrees Celsius — three times hotter than the surface of the sun — in less than one second .
The initial tearing noise is usually caused by the stepped leader , and the sharp click or crack heard just before the main crash is caused by the positive streamer up from the ground .
We can't hear thunder more than about 25 miles away from a storm , but the lightning may still be visible , since light travels faster and farther than sound .
This type of seemingly silent lightning is often called " heat lightning , " a common misnomer .
Lightning hits the planet about 100 times every second , or roughly 8 million times a day .
While up to 80 percent of all lightning stays within the cloud where it formed , it 's also well - known for venturing out , and comes in a wide range of styles , from spider and sheet lightning to blue jets , sprites and elves .
From the ' I did not know that ' files :
LAS VEGAS .
I met up with Nortel Networks enterprise business chief John McHugh at Interop to talk about their big new routing platform the VSP9000 .
It 's a platform capable of up to 27 terabits per second ( Tbps ) of switching capacity and McHugh told me it represents a $ 250 million investment in research and development from Nortel -- and its powered by Linux .
" We believe Linux is the right OS for the entire architecture , " McHugh said
Now , I do n't know all the specifics of Nortel 's involvement in core kernel contributions and precisely how they source the elements of their Linux .
I asked McHugh and he indicated that it was a partnership .
In any event , it 's an interesting platform and McHugh has some interesting and encouraging things to say about Linux in the last bit of the video I shot on site that you can view below .
Samsung has new pocket projector
Well , you ’ll still need bigger pockets than what ’s usual to take it with you … but who trots along with a full VGA color projector in their back pocket anyway ?
But whatever the new Samsung P410 M lacks in size , it does make up in terms of pure specs punch , all in a package that is , well , pocketable .
Supposedly .
The P410 M is capable of color VGA output up to 800×600 resolution , with a 1,000:1 contrast ratio .
The lens are made to last too , packing along up to 30,000 hours of use with it .
It has a VGA , composite ( that ’s AV cables ) and a USB port .
It also has a pair of 1W stereo speakers .
" These are unnatural acts not designed for human beings .
The decision of the High Court , if allowed to sustain will have catastrophic effects on the moral fabric of society and will jeopardise the institution of marriage itself .
This offends the structure of Indian value system , Indian culture and traditions , as derived from religious scriptures , " it said .
Emma Watson teaming up with Marilyn Manson for a new film
Emma Watson is teaming up with Marilyn Manson for a new film .
The ‘ Harry Potter ’ actress is reportedly set to star as a princess in a gothic musical reworking of ‘ Cinderella ’ , which is currently being written by the outrageous rocker .
A source said : “ Emma really wants to show there ’s more to her talents than playing Hermione Granger .
She ’s saw how Daniel Radcliffe managed to branch out into something completely different when he starred in ‘ Equus ’ and thinks this could do the same for her – after all , who ’d guess she ’s want to team with Marilyn Manson , of all people . ”
Emma recently revealed she has no plans to take on any more acting work unless she feels as strongly about the project as she did with ‘ Harry Potter ’ .
She said : " I do n't have a burning passion for acting .
" Until something comes along that I feel as strongly about as I did Hermione - like , I felt that it was life or death - I do n't want to act again . "
The 19 - year - old star is planning to move to America to attend university later this year but does n’t believe it will have any impact on her work , if the right role comes along .
She explained : " Jodie Foster did it , Natalie Portman did it .
I think it 's entirely possible to juggle university with filming .
" I actually think going to university will make me a better actress .
The experience of living like that , working to deadlines , living with other students .
It 's all the things I want . "
Making vast improvements on the hardware and even offering digital copies in exchange for your UMDs , the PSPgo does seem to be worth the $ 250 price point .
However , those looking to upgrade from their previous PSP units will want to take note of this .
Shown in the image above , are the official PSP Go accessories shown to the press after the bulk of E3 was over .
As you can see , everything consumers would expect in a new product is going to be offered by Sony Computer Entertainment upon the launch of the PSP Go .
The downside ?
Similar to most mainstream products , a common practice being used by the PSP
Go is proprietary accessories , forcing the consumers to purchase a new set of accessories for the handheld .
The PSP
Go uses a multifunction port , and because of this , consumers will have to buy all new chargers , component , composite , and USB cables .
While the former is to be expected , the latter is a potential nuisance to consumers who have multiple mini-USB cables .
Sports organisations are poised to call in the lawyers to pick over their contracts with Setanta as it stands on the brink of collapse .
While the enhanced competition brought about by the Irish broadcaster 's entry into the British pay - TV market has fuelled record deals for sports including football , boxing , golf and rugby union , it has now become clear that Setanta is unlikely to be able to honour its commitments .
" It looks like there is no more in the cupboard , " one source familiar with its predicament said last night .
Now , having planned their budgets on the basis of the revenues arising from Setanta 's pledges , sports organisations and clubs will be forced into an uncomfortable recalibration of their expenditure .
Some , including the FA with its £ 175 m four - year deal and the Premier League ( whose contract with Setanta is worth £ 130 m for the broadcast of 46 matches a year ) benefit from shareholder guarantees ensuring they will be paid even if the company fails .
It was the absence of those guarantees that caused such financial pain to Football League clubs with the collapse of ITV ­Digital in 2002 .
Several clubs were forced into insolvency after planning their budgets on forward revenues , indeed often borrowing against them .
Yet despite that experience several sports bodies who sold to Setanta are believed not to have such watertight arrangements with the broadcaster 's shareholders , the venture capitalists Balderton Capital and Doughty Hanson and the investment bank Goldman Sachs .
Setanta 's failure would have far - reaching consequences .
The Guinness Premiership rugby clubs were set to benefit from a £ 54 m three - year deal from the 2010 - 11 season , with the Scottish Premier League 's contract worth £ 125 m running until 2014 .
It is arguably those deals , both signed last year , that have apparently tipped the company over the edge , since they reduced the available cash to spend on what has always been its core offering : Premier League football .
League negotiators , who must sell their rights to the highest bidder under the agreement with the European Commission competitions authority , are said to have reacted with disbelief when they opened Setanta 's tender .
With Deloitte expected to be appointed administrator before the month is out , sports bodies now have two hopes .
The first relies on the largesse of Sky , since sports would be returning to a monopoly market with their content .
Insiders at the Murdoch broadcaster point to their £ 70 m bid for Football League rights after the ITV Digital collapse , a sum that looked positively philanthropic at the time .
Sport 's better hope is that a white - knight buyer takes on the company in short order with an offer to guarantee its losses , currently estimated to be £ 100 m a year .
Paradoxically , after balking at the £ 1bn it was quoted when previously inquiring about a takeover of Setanta , the Disney subsidiary ESPN might consider even that a good deal .

David M. Herszenhorn and Robert Pear write in the New York Times :
The fate of the health care overhaul largely rests on the shoulders of six senators who since June 17 have gathered " " often twice a day , and for many hours at a stretch " " in a conference room with burnt sienna walls , in the office of the Senate Finance Committee chairman , Max Baucus , Democrat of Montana .
President Obama and Congressional leaders agree that if a bipartisan deal can be forged on health care , it will emerge from this conference room , with a huge map of Montana on one wall and photos of Mike Mansfield , the Montanan who was the longest - serving Senate majority leader , on the other .
The battle over health care is all but paralyzed as everyone awaits the outcome of their talks .
Why this little scenario needs to change , right now :
Already , the group of six has tossed aside the idea of a government - run insurance plan that would compete with private insurers , which the president supports but Republicans said was a deal - breaker .
Instead , they are proposing a network of private , nonprofit cooperatives .
They have also dismissed the House Democratic plan to pay for the bill 's roughly $ 1 trillion , 10 - year cost partly with an income surtax on high earners .
The three Republicans have insisted that any new taxes come from within the health care arena .
As one option , Democrats have proposed taxing high - end insurance plans with values exceeding $ 25,000 .
The Senate group also seems prepared to drop a requirement , included in other versions of the legislation , that employers offer coverage to their workers .
" " In the House , centrist Democrats have temporarily stalled the health care bill , many lawmakers want to see what Mr. Baucus 's group produces before voting on tax increases in the House bill .
I read this first thing this morning , and I can not tell you how sick I feel .
That the lives of Americans rest with this corrupt little crew " " at least some of them are essentially sponsored by Big Pharma and other parts of the medical - industrial complex , who are major campaign contributors " " is beyond outrageous .
It is the utter failure of American democracy in microcosm .
My favorite quote :
A film poem inspired by the Peruvian poet César Vallejo .
A story about our need for love , our confusion , greatness and smallness and , most of all , our vulnerability .
It is a story with many characters , among them a father and his mistress , his youngest son and his girlfriend .
It is a film about big lies , abandonment and the eternal longing for companionship and confirmation .

The Internet is quickly destroying the need for newspapers to run printing presses , distribute papers around the city , and employ newspaper carriers , but the cost savings have come with revenue losses , too : most newspapers offer their online content without subscription fees , supported only by ads .
A group of media executives has just announced Journalism Online , a new way for newspapers to start charging for online subscription fees .
Will it save journalism ?
" We have formed Journalism Online , because we think this is a special moment in time when there is an urgent need for a business model that allows quality journalism to be the beneficiary of the Internet 's efficient delivery mechanism rather than its victim , " said cofounder Steven Brill .
" We believe we have developed a strategy and a set of services that will establish that model by restoring a stream of circulation revenue to supplement advertising revenue , while taking advantage of the savings to be gained from producing and delivering content electronically . "
That circulation revenue will come from a new Web portal that handles payments and authentication .
Journalism
Online wants to sell monthly and yearly subscription packages to sets of magazines or newspapers , which may be an easier sell than convincing readers to pay separately at multiple online news sites .
Money would be distributed to the newspapers based on the popularity of their content .
The new company is headed by Brill , the founder of CourtTV and Brill 's Content , former Wall Street Journal publisher Gordon Crovitz , and former cable exec Leo Hindery .
Discussions with newspapers have only begun , but Brill has previously spelled out what he thinks newspapers like The New York Times need to do in order to stay competitive , and the ideas are worth a closer look .
In a memo earlier this year , Brill argued that sites like the Times could better capitalize on its 20 million online readers by :
Charging 10 � to read each article
Charging 40 � to read all the articles from that day
Selling a one - month subscription for $ 7.50
Selling a one - year subscription for $ 55
Offering print subscribers online access at a 50 percent discount
Charging 5 � to forward a full - text article to someone else
Offering a 5 percent affiliate payout to sites like the Huffington Post when they drive paying customers to the Times
The Journalism Online model wo n't follow this plan identically , differing most obviously in its one - stop subscriptions to multiple news services , but it 's clear that Brill has given a lot of thought to transitioning online news service away from ad - only revenue streams .
He does n't paint search engines like Google as the enemy , either .
Brill wants to preserve newspapers ' search results , so he advocates letting search engines show the headline and first paragraph of every article .
Shifting customers away from the " free " online news model might be difficult , but the idea is to turn a liability into a strength — billing online news as something where " you get what you pay for . "
It might sound audacious , but charging more for content has worked well for some offline news outlets .
Even in an era of cheap online news , The Economist ( for instance ) is doing well with $ 100 + per year subscriptions because it's offers an incredible product that people are willing to pay for .
The result ?
Unlike almost every other magazine in the world , The Economist actually pulls in more revenue from subscriptions than it does from advertising .
Brill et al. want to move online news in this direction , and they argue that it 's necessary to support quality journalism .
Will people pay ?
With the Associated Press also making plenty of noise about charging more for content , it 's possible that a big chunk on US - generated online news could go behind the pay wall in the next year or so .
That will certainly drive readers to quality sites that remain ad - supported ( like The Guardian 's excellent UK website , which has a huge group of American readers already ) , but Journalism Online hopes that a substantial proportion will choose to pay up for unlimited access to online news .
" My experience with The Wall Street Journal taught me that people will pay a reasonable price to access exclusive , differentiated and essential journalism , whether delivered in print or online , " said Gordon Crovitz , announcing the new venture .
" News publishers , including digital - only operations , need to find ways to attract revenues from readers as well as from advertisers . "

Scala 2.8 will support continuations , a powerful control flow abstraction .
Among other things , continuations allow using callback oriented , event driven APIs in a direct , statement - by - statement style .
This will potentially simplify a number of programming tasks :
doing asynchronous I/O using Java NIO
using executors and thread pools
handling cross-request control flow in web applications
There wo n't be any new API 's for these use cases in Scala 2.8 , but we expect them to emerge once the underlying continuation machinery is in place .
A Glimpse of Shift and Reset
A continuation , " captured " at some point in a program , embodies " the rest " of the program at that certain point .
The interesting part is that continuations can be treated as regular function values , e.g. saved in a data structure and invoked only later , or not at all , or multiple times .
Continuations in Scala differ from those available in languages like Scheme or ML , in that Scala 's continuations are composable ( or " delimited " ) .
This means that they embody not the whole rest of the program , but just a partial rest , up to a programmer - defined outer boundary .
Continuations are manipulated by means of two primitives , shift and reset .
Calling shift captures the current continuation , and reset defines the boundary up to which the continuation reaches .
Here is an example :
reset { ... shift { k : ( Int= > Int ) => // the continuation k will be the '_ + 1 ' below k ( 7 ) } + 1 } // result : 8
Of course , shift and reset are library functions , not new keywords .
They also need not appear as close together syntactically .
In fact , corresponding uses of shift and reset may occur in completely unrelated methods .
The type system ensures that nothing goes wrong and requires every method that contains a free shift to be marked with a type annotation @cps on its return type .
For many cases though , this type annotation is inferred automatically , transparent to the programmer .
def foo( ) : Int @cps [ Int , Int ] = { // could leave out return type shift { k : ( Int= > Int ) => k ( 7 ) } + 1 } reset ( 2 * foo( ) ) // result : 16
Here is another example that illustrates the connection to callback driven API's :
import java.util .
{Timer , TimerTask} val timer = new Timer ( ) def sleep ( delay : Int ) = shift { k : ( Unit => Unit ) => timer.schedule( new TimerTask { def run ( ) = k( ) // in a real program , we 'd execute k on a thread pool } , delay ) } reset { println ( " look , Ma ... " ) sleep ( 1000 ) println ( " no threads ! " ) }
If you feel adventurous , try out the pre-release continuations plugin for the Scala compiler yourself ( available from the source repository ) .
To learn all the gritty details about how continuations are implemented in Scala 2.8 , have a look at the corresponding paper ( accepted at ICFP'09 ) .
Protests took place outside the UK embassy in Tehran The UK has ordered the expulsion of two Iranian diplomats in a tit - for - tat action after Tehran also ordered two UK diplomats to leave the country .
Prime Minister Gordon Brown told MPs he had no choice but to respond after Iran had made allegations that were " absolutely without foundation " .
The two diplomats were accused by Iran of " activities incompatible with their status " , the Foreign Office said .
Mass unrest on the streets of Tehran has been blamed by Iran on the UK .
Ambassador summoned
The prime minister told the House of Commons : " Iran yesterday took the unjustified step of expelling two British diplomats over allegations which are absolutely without foundation .
ANALYSIS Paul Adams
Diplomatic correspondent , BBC News " One casualty of Iran 's deepening political crisis has been Britain 's already delicate diplomatic relationship with the Islamic Republic .
" Iran 's decision to expel two British diplomats follows days of anti-British rhetoric from the leadership in Tehran , including strong words last Friday from Iran 's supreme leader , Ayatollah Khamenei - who described Britain as the ' most treacherous ' of Iran 's enemies .
" Until recently , the United States was singled out as the Islamic Revolution 's principal opponent .
This has changed .
" By offering an ' open hand ' to Iran since taking over as president , Barack Obama has challenged Iran 's traditional view of the ' Great Satan ' .
" Britain , almost by default , has emerged as the target of Iranian ire . " " In response to that action , we informed the Iranian ambassador today that we would expel two Iranian diplomats from their embassy in London . "
The protests , which erupted after the results of presidential elections were contested , have left at least 10 people dead in the capital .
Mr Brown added that the outcome of the elections should reflect the aspirations and choices of the people there .
" The onus is on Iran to show the Iranian people that recent elections have been credible and that the repression and curtailment of democratic rights that we 've seen in the last few days will cease , " he said .
The Foreign and Commonwealth Office ( FCO ) did not specify the identities of the individuals being expelled from Iran , except to say they are diplomats , rather than support staff , and the British Ambassador is not one of them .
An FCO spokesman said the Iranian Ambassador was summoned to the Foreign Office earlier to be told two Iranian diplomats holding equivalent positions in London were also being asked to leave by the end of the week .
He said the action was " regrettable " but the UK had been forced to respond .
The spokesman added that Tehran had claimed the British diplomats had been " involved in activities incompatible with their status " .
Internal divisions
The BBC's James Robbins said the allegation , which the UK rejected , is usually cover for an accusation of espionage .
He added that the British Ambassador pressed Iranian authorities to give specific examples of what " incompatible activities " the British diplomats had been involved in , but they did not offer any .

News world affairs editor John Simpson says it is significant the Iranian action is not worse , such as throwing the British ambassador out or closing the embassy .
He said that was down to divisions going right to the top of the Iranian government , with some elements wanting to calm the situation down .
Conservative leader David Cameron supported the decision to expel the Iranian diplomats .
He said : " The expulsion of diplomats by Iran is clearly not acceptable and the British government was absolutely right to respond . "
Iran has singled out the UK in its widespread condemnation of what it calls meddling by foreign powers in its affairs .
The BBC 's decision to start a Persian language TV service , earlier this year , has also angered the authorities .
The service has no correspondent in Tehran , but on Sunday the government expelled the BBC's English language correspondent .

Vote for Barack Obama !
By Emalafe Zeleke
For people of African decent , recent immigrants as well as those who have lived in the United States for decades , the election presents a unique opportunity to play a role in a truly rare moment in history .
Tomorrow we can join the chorus for change and restore a sense of hope for a better world , for a policy of cooperation , mutual respect , diplomacy , civility and progress .
Central to the sense of optimism that fueled millions of people in the United States as well as the rest of the world is the break from the past Barack Obama ’s candidacy represents .
Not only does Senator Obama offers a new vision in domestic and foreign policies , but his election also would also usher in a presidency unlike any other in the history of the United States .
Having said all that one can ask what does Senator Obama ’s candidacy mean for Ethiopian Americans ?
Why vote for Barack ?
What do an Obama victory and the subsequent policies of indeed entail for citizens ?
I am sure many of us ask such questions .
Here are my reasons for writing this piece at 11:55 before the final verdict is made by the electorate after the most decisive voting hours of Nov 24 , 2008 : ( 1 ) the world is getting increasingly intertwined and requires a transformative leader such as Senator Obama to tackle regional and global issues , ( 2 ) A Barak Obama Presidency would promote global cooperation and set progressive global priorities , ( 3 ) A Barak Obama Presidency would promote democracy and the protection of human rights in Africa .
In his most recent interview with a national media where he endorsed Barack Obama , General Colin Powel , the former US Secretary of State , aptly used the phrase “ a transformative figure ” when describing Senator Barack Obama .
In this age of globalization , when the “ flat world ” is becoming even more flatter , the world ever getting crowded , and the global climate getting warmer , by the day , it is not only America that needs a transformative leader , but also the world .
Geopolitical and geo strategy scholars and pundits alike–starting with Paul Kennedy ’s book on The Rise and Decline of Great Powers — have been talking about the relative decline of the USA as the most powerful country in the world .
A decline that has a simultaneous geopolitical dynamic with the emergence of new regional powers vying to be global powers , thus the increasing trends of the geo political chess board towards a polycentric world of multiple power centers .
Among the contending countries is included formerly regional powers such as China , who is flexing its economic muscle along with an authoritarian political system that still remain among the few relics of a bygone era still hanging stubbornly .
Although faced with many troubles on several fronts , including the ongoing financial crisis and economic recession that tops it all , the United States of America remains the most powerful country , with the vastest natural resources , with the most vibrant , and innovative entrepreneurial spirit of its citizenry .
And it remains to be the most technologically advanced country among the nations of the world .
Despite the often times ugly sides of US foreign policy that deserves much by way of negative reaction and even condemnation , the best of America ’s promise to the world , yet remain its ideals of liberty , democracy , and justice .
Ideals that move , shake , and inspire much of humanity in sharp contradistinction to models offered by the Chinese and other authoritarian and atavistic political systems where human beings lack their inalienable rights to enjoy liberty , that unique value towards which the human spirit , universally , aspires and struggles towards attainment and consummation .
These are the American virtues and ideals that need fulfillment not only for Americans , but for all of humanity .
As the old saying has it when America sneezes , it brings tears to the rest of the world is as true and even more relevant today in this increasingly Globalized and interconnected world , as it was decades ago .
Asserting that America is in an economic recession would be commenting on the obviously common knowledge .
The world is also suffering from yet a some what forgotten recession .
What Larry Diamond , a Senior Fellow at Stanford University ’s Hoover institute , argues as the specter of “ Democratic recession ” that has been plaguing countries around the world .
The world needs a rescue package not only for the economic recession but also for the regression of democracy and its role back to many strands of Authoritarian regimes around the Globe , as Mr. Diamond argued in the April / March issue of Foreign Affairs .
Barack Obama has made it clear that good governance , democracy , and human rights will be the cornerstones of his foreign policy .
During successive US administrations , especially with the Bush administration , the USA has forfeited that unique position global leadership it often enjoyed –not due to its position as global power– due to the loftiest of human ideals America cherishes – the ideals of liberty and democracy all human beings aspire to attain .
Few years ago , the current President George W. Bush pledged and made it known that America would be on the side of people under the yoke of tyranny and fighting for freedom while in practice it pursued an expedient foreign policy fraught with double standards and hypocrisy of cuddling and rewarding dictatorial regimes that are deemed friendly and under the single minded fixation and criteria of them being “ allies of the war on terror ” .
The list of these friendly dictatorial regimes includes gross human rights violators and those who muzzle the free press like Meles Zenwai of Ethiopia , Musharaf of Pakistan and others .
By contrast , from the outset , in speeches , debates , and interviews on foreign policy matters , Senator Barack Obama has indicated that he will part with the longstanding policy of successive US administrations –both Republicans and democrats– .
i.e. that of patting the so - called friendly dictators on their shoulders and looking the other way when these brutal regimes , often times also corrupt , commit massive violation of human rights against their citizens .
This glimpse of a new trend in Barack Obama ’s foreign policy – if pursued with vigor and without succumbing to the narrow - minded and expedient single agenda of “ fighting the war on terror ” and other justifications in the name of national interest –will surely help in reviving the depressed conditions of democracy and lack of basic liberties around the world .
Such a policy would help in bringing back those nations suffering from lack of democracy , human rights and good governance towards the right track .
Such a reconfiguration in US foreign policy would help those in “ democratic recession ” even a depression , counties like Ethiopia back on track towards genuine democracy and constitutional liberalism , i.e. , where substantive norms and rules of democracy –as opposed to superficial forms such as holding periodic elections – are the norms , where the rule of law is not replaced overnight by the rule , whim and wish of those holding the levers on state power , where elections are not held under an atmosphere that lack the elementary rules of the game , under conditions that lack the basic criteria for free and fair elections , where there is an absence of a meaningful and truly independent and free press , and where the respect and guarantee for the basic civil and political liberties of each and every citizen and political opposition alike are utterly absent .
Few skeptics have lately expressed a concern with regard to aspects of Obama ’s foreign policy when it comes to dealing with such undemocratic regimes .
To support their claim they point our to some bad apples that have somehow made it into his foreign policy team , individuals with track record of abetting and aiding dictatorial regimes and patting them on their shoulders .
As seen , for instance , during the May 2005 national election in Ethiopia , where the regime security forces who were under the direct command of the prime minister gunned down more than 190 unarmed protesters in its bid to steal the election after committing massive fraud , and at the end getting away with it .
In part , with the help and outright justification of those brutal actions by these bad apples .
Although such a concern as expressed by these commentators is warranted , one should also be cognizant of the presence of decent and principled foreign policy experts and professionals in that team , who seem to be as committed to democracy , human rights , and good governance in the developing world as Obama has said to uphold .
Foreign policy experts , advisors , and professionals who are as eager to restore the broken image USA has suffered around the world as a result of the debacle of the policies of the Bush administration , This should give us comfort that the bad apples would not hold the commanding heights in his foreign policy team to pursue their sinister and un-American agenda of dilly dallying and abetting dictatorial regimes .
There is another indicator as to the persona of Barack Obama .
We find the clue as to why one should be optimistic about US foreign policy under an Obama presidency from yet another source .
In the The Audacity of Hope , Barack Obama wrote : “ … All of which raises the question : what are the core values that we , as Americans , hold in common ?
One core value , individual freedom , is so deeply ingrained in us that we tend to take it for granted .
I remember the first time I took Michelle to Kenya , shortly before we were married .
As an African - American , she was bursting with excitement about the idea of visiting the continent of her ancestors , and we had a wonderful time , visiting my grandmother upcountry , wandering through the streets of Nairobi , camping in the Serengeti , fishing off the island of Lamu .
But during our travels Michelle also heard – as I had heard during my first trip to Africa – the terrible sense on the part of most Kenyans that their fates were not their own .
My cousins told her how difficult it was to find a job or start their own businesses without paying bribes .
Activists told us about being jailed for expressing their opposition to government policies …. ”
The above quoted paragraph from his autobiography tells much by way of Obama ’s ’ sympathy and empathy with people who find themselves in miserable conditions and lack the basic and deeply cherished American values — Liberty and the pursuit of happiness .
The quoted paragraphs also tell say much about his deeper understanding of the very sad conditions found among many countries and the peoples living in these countries , it says much about the character of Obama , his core values .
The deeply held principles of a very decent man .
Let us not forget the very man who was an outstanding law school student at Harvard and President of Harvard Law Review , opted to accept much lower pay as community organizer , turning down six digit salary job offers from the corporate world .
This too is indicative of Obama ’s core values and character , that of siding with the average person , and his commitment to change the lot of the under dogs of society , as opposed to aligning with the politically powerful and the wealthy .
Farid Zakaria , the former editor of Foreign Affairs , and now with Newsweek magazine , in his most recent article , observes that “ … Bill Clinton and Hilary Clinton were always careful not to stay too far from the country ’s comfort zone .
Obama is pushing to change the parameter of that zone .
That ’s leadership . ”
It is this tendency to push to change the parameters of the zone , about which Mr. Zakaria talks about that should make us comfortable about the kind of foreign policy that Senator Obama will pursue .
It is the kind of leadership qualities Obama embodies that give hope and optimism about his “ Transformative ” potential not only to reconfigure the political edifice and policies here in the USA , but also on the Global scale .
Viewed from the broad challenges facing humanity , our planet is in great peril , and continues heading towards a catastrophe of epochal proportion .
Global warming , climate change , and an ever depleting of natural resources – the depletion of the world ’s rangelands , forests , fishers , biodiversity etc — in unprecedented scale and beyond their natural capacity to regenerate themselves as a result of voracious quest of nations of the world for economic progress in an unsustainable and ecologically disastrous path .
We have come to a point of no return .
Thus , greatly threatening the very survival of human civilization and the continuity of future generations .
In much of the developing world such as Ethiopia and much of the countries of Africa , we still face monumental challenges of hunger , abject poverty , the specter of AIDs , and corrupt and tyrannical regimes that exacerbate and compound the misery of hundreds of millions who under abject poverty and ever pushed on the farthest edges of society to engage in actions that degrade the environment on massive scale for sheer survival .
These challenges desperately need Leaders with fresh ideas , bold visions , principles and the will for decisive action .
The leading scientists of many countries including the USA , the most prominent climatologists around the Globe , and Inter governmental agencies studying climate change and many other internationally recognized authoritative bodies and personalities such as Jeff Sachs of The Earth Institute at Colombia University and Lester Brown of the Earth Policy Institute have come to a similar consensus with regard to this central problem of our era .
They have ringed the alarm bell about the state of our planet .
The single and most pervasive conclusion that has emerged from these massive findings from varied sources is that the human impact on the natural environment has reached a complexity and magnitude unprecedented in history , which may well endanger the survival of human civilizations and human life on this planet .
Barack Obama ’s ’ energy policy and his avowedly strong commitment to gear the backbone of the most powerful industrial civilization , the American energy system towards alternative , clean and green energy sources promises to put a brake to the current trend towards what has been termed as “ ecocide ” of Global proportion , stemming from dependency , in large part , on the dirty fuels such as oil and coal .
With a majority democratic congress , many hope that America would be able to tackle more seriously and even lead international conventions and the agenda for action to meet the challenges of Global climate change and the Global environmental crises .
Obama ’s energy policy would create millions of green jobs , minimize USA ’s dependence on Middle Eastern oil , and in the process would bring the US towards an energy system that depends on clean and environmentally non-polluting economy , a model economy of the 21st century .
This in turn would surely help in diffusing innovation in solar , wind and other renewable technologies to the rest of the world .
Thus , eventually leading towards the phasing out of the reliance on “ Petro dictators ” , as argued with massive data and persuasive new vision by Thomas Freidman , the New York Times Foreign Affairs correspondent and bestselling author of several books including his most recent :
Hot , Flat , Crowded : Why We need a Green Revolution and How it can Renew America .
Mr. Freidman proposes a similar action when he asks Americans “ what kind of America would you like to see — an America where there is not big national goal , or a green America , where inventing sources so abundant , clean , reliable , and cheap electrons , which could enable the whole planet to grow in a way that does not destroy its remaining natural habitat , becomes the goal of this generation … ” Barak Obama ’s energy policy promises to usher a new era for America , America that is not fettered by “ petro dictators ” due to addictions to oil .
In so far as America remains a leader of the world , if America rises to be the best of her potential , she can change the course of history , not only for America ’s sake , but also for the sake of the rest of the world , the survival of humanity at large .
There are many reasons that indicate that Barack Obama is such a leader , bringing USA to rise to the best of herself .
Indeed to these monumental and epochal challenges with the support of the tens of millions of his supporters , including tens of millions of white Americans who have transcended racial divide and outdated thinking of a bygone era .
In deed seeing in him and as Martin Luther King Jr. dreamed some forty years ago– , judging him by the content of his character , not based on the color of his skin .
A man has come on the world stage ; a unique leader has emerged to lead the most powerful country on the planet .
If elected as a President , not only America but the world would need the qualities and visions of Barack Obama .
He may not be the alpha and omega , but he certainly can put America on the right track and with America ’s leading by example , the rest of the world would follow .
Let us rise up to the occasion .
Let us seize the moment .
Let us vote for hope , vote for change ; vote a better and stronger America .
Vote for a cleaner and greener America , and consequently a cleaner and greener world .
Let us vote not only for ourselves but also for the continuity and survival of humanity on planet earth .
Vote for Democratic Presidential candidate Barack Obama .

" wo n’t rest " until he ’s cut health care costs and improved quality ?
Over here ,
Mr. President , says Jennie Joseph , a certified professional midwife who runs a
birth center in Winter Garden , Florida .
Midwives like Joseph provide
what you could call " less - is - more care . "
Compared to healthy women who get
standard obstetric care and deliver on high - tech labor and delivery wards ,
women with low - risk pregnancies who get care with a midwife and deliver in
birth centers or even in their own homes , benefit from a five - fold decrease in
the chance of a cesarean delivery , more success with breastfeeding , and less
likelihood that their baby will be born too early or end up in intensive care .
And all of this for
a fraction of the cost of the status quo .
A new economic
analysis forecasts savings of $ 9.1
billion per year if 10 percent of women planned to deliver out of hospital with
midwives .
( Right now , just one percent do ) .
If America is serious about reform , midwifery advocates are
saying , " Hey , how about us ? "

Childbirth , in fact , costs the United States more in hospital charges than any
other health condition — $ 86 billion in 2006 , almost half paid for by
taxpayers .
This high price tag — twice as high as what most European countries
spend — buys us one of the most medicalized maternity care systems in the
industrialized world .
Yet we have among the worst outcomes : high rates of
preterm birth , infant mortality , and maternal mortality , with huge disparities
by race .
In Orange County , Florida , where Jennie Joseph practices , one in five
African - American babies were born premature in 2007 .
In response to these
disparities , Joseph also runs a prenatal clinic that turns away no one and
coordinates care with the local hospital .
Among the women who got prenatal care
" The JJ Way " in 2007 , less than 1 in 20 gave birth preterm , and there were zero disparities .
" It ’s not rocket science , " Joseph told
me .
" It ’s really just about practitioners being willing to have conversations
with women . "
Joseph is perhaps being coy , but whatever she ’s doing , we should
be studying it very closely .
Midwives
like Joseph are n’t nurses or doctors .
They do n’t offer epidurals , schedule
labor inductions , or perform surgery .
What they do is provide primary care for
normal pregnancy and physiological childbirth , and they only intervene or
transfer to the next level of care when needed .
The model works .
In a study of 5,000 healthy women who
planned home births with certified professional midwives in North America , 96 percent
gave birth vaginally with hardly any intervention , and their babies were born
just as safely as similarly low - risk women who plan hospital births .
The
results track with other studies of planned , midwife - attended , out - of - hospital
birth .
Standard
obstetric care , on the other hand , routinely induces and speeds up labor ,
immobilizes women and has them push in disadvantageous positions , cuts
episiotomies , employs vacuum extractors , and in nearly 1 out of 3 births ,
delivers surgically via cesarean section .
This routine use of intervention is
not based on medical necessity , and there ’s actually a vast body of
evidence now showing that much of what we do
in American labor and delivery wards is unnecessary , ineffective , and
potentially harmful .
Midwives like Joseph , it turns out , are providing
evidence - based care …at bargain prices .
" The obstetric model of care right now does not empower
anybody , " says Joseph .
" We ’re not getting high quality of care that enables us
to have healthy outcomes .
We ’ve got the worst outcomes .
Where do we think they
come from ?
They come from a system that does n’t work . "
Back in April I attended a symposium in Washington , DC , sponsored by the think
tank Childbirth Connection , called
" Transforming Maternity Care : A High Value Proposition . "
An impressive array of
stakeholders participated : seasoned physicians , midwives , nurses , hospital
administrators , health system executives , insurance officers , public health
officials , and NIH researchers met in workgroups for more than a year to evaluate
the current system and hammer out recommendations .
There was remarkable
consensus that the system is n’t working , that there are " perverse incentives "
for the overuse of medical intervention at the expense of maternal and infant
health .
A
physician and chair of the United States Preventive Services Task Force
reported :
" There ’s a shortage of providers whose training focuses on wellness , "
and even suggested that " we should support the education of providers ,
facilities , and insurance on the evidence that supports the safety of home
deliveries for the appropriate low - risk women within the context of an
integrated system of care . "
A VP from WellPoint , one of the largest health
insurers , said flatly : " You get what you pay for .
What we are paying for now is
high intervention , high cost , high procedural care . "
An executive from
Geisinger Health System made a startling admission :
" There are many healthcare
organizations across the country [ that ] have become , unfortunately , dependent upon
NICU [ Neonatal Intensive Care Unit ] volumes to fund many of their other
services . "
In other words , our for - profit system not only rewards the overuse
of intervention even if it leads to more sick babies ; in some cases , it
depends on it .
So , if this system is broken , and this system is wasting public funds , and this
system is harming women and babies , why is n’t fixing it part of the national
conversation on health reform ?
" We ’re sitting here in the birth community
scratching our heads , " says Susan Jenkins , an attorney who’s on the steering
committee of the Big Push for Midwives , a national campaign to license certified
professional midwives in every state , and an advisor to the American Association of Birth Centers , both of
which are lobbying congress for inclusion in health reform bills .
" Here we’ve
got this huge sector of the healthcare dollar where we can save costs and
improve quality .
And it goes beyond midwives .
It ’s about improving these really
horrible outcomes .
Why is n’t anybody talking about this ? "
It ’s a valid question , and it begs another , more difficult question :
Why is n’t
the women ’s health community talking about this ?
Cesarean section is far more
dangerous and debilitating than vaginal birth , and 1.2 million American women
now go through it each year .
Fully half of first time mothers are induced into
labor , which adds significant pain and risk .
A quarter of women who give birth
vaginally still get episiotomies ( cutting the vaginal opening during labor ) ,
though the practice has been debunked by research for years .
As if to add
insult to injury , women who ’ve previously given birth by cesarean are
systematically being refused vaginal birth , or VBAC ( vaginal birth after
cesarean ) : about half of hospitals ban it , which
essentially tells women they have no choice but to submit to scheduled repeat surgery .
You might think that one of these issues would come up at the recent round
table discussion on women ’s health at the White
House , and yet you ’d be wrong .
In 90 minutes there was not one mention of the
rising cesarean rate or the rising maternal death rate , nor of VBAC denials ,
nor of birth centers , nor home birth , nor any mention of midwives , nor were any
midwifery organizations represented among the 25 participants .
The only
childbirth - related topic brought up was pre-term birth and access to care , but
no question as to the quality of the care itself .
" There has n’t been any
healthcare reform agenda put out by any national women ’s groups that has
embraced birth centers and midwives and evidenced - based maternity care as a
prime element of health care for women , " says Susan Jenkins .

THE
PREGNANT ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM
Early in 2008 , long before Obama was even the Democratic nominee for President ,
the women ’s health community began organizing in anticipation of a new
administration .
On the advice of former Clinton advisors , groups like The
National Partnership for Women and Families , The National Women ’s Law Center ,
The Center for American Progress , Planned Parenthood , and the ACLU Reproductive
Rights Task Force formed a coalition to hammer out what it would ask for from
the new administration .
" With Clinton , it was all thrown together very last
minute , " says Lisa Summers , who was with the National Partnership for Women and
Families at the time .
" We were told it would behoove the reproductive rights
community to come together as a coalition so when the new president is elected
we ’d be ready to go to the transition team and say , This is what we want . "
The
coalition was unprecedented .
At the same time , the birth community was organizing like never before , with the
launch of The Big Push for Midwives , not to mention the growth of hundreds of
local consciousness raising groups and steady DVD sales of The Business of
Being Born , with
national media coverage of a rising demand for midwife - attended home birth .
The
Big Push has so far persuaded several legislatures to license and regulate
providers who had been previously considered criminals , and they ’ve got active
or pending legislation in 18 states .
Their success is thanks in large part to
grassroots organizing , and to organizing across the abortion divide .
" In Wisconsin
we had a pro-life legislator from a rural part of the state introduce our
legislation and one of the most liberal pro-choice senators from Milwaukee sign
on to support it , " says Katie Prown of the Big Push .
In Missouri , it was the
hard - right anti-abortion state senator John Loudon who snuck pro-midwife
language into a bill .
Obama wants a common ground issue ?
This is it .
By early spring , the coalition of women ’s health groups had done initial brainstorming
and divided into issue areas .
One was " healthy pregnancies . "
Summers , a
certified nurse midwife who had served as a director of the American College of
Nurse Midwives , was delighted to see this and immediately joined the group .
Coming from the provider community , Summers had a different perspective than
the other members , most of whom had backgrounds in reproductive rights law ,
with one exception : a lobbyist for the American College of Obstetricians and
Gynecologists .
Summers offered to reach out to groups like Childbirth
Connection , ACNM , and AWHONN , the organization for obstetric and neonatal
nurses , so more stakeholders could have input .
The National Advocates for
Pregnant Women and the Big Push connected with the group as well .
The Big
Push promptly sent a detailed memo that called for inclusion of Certified Professional Midwives ( CPMs ) as
Medicaid providers , an investigation into " the frightening increase in cesarean
surgery rates and hospital bans on VBAC , " and stronger federal support for
breastfeeding , among other specific suggestions for federal and administrative
action .
" Ultimately , midwifery , home birth , and birth centers must be included
in whatever healthcare reform plan is enacted , " wrote the Big Push , " but these
interim steps to include all midwives and birth centers in Medicaid / Medicare
are greatly needed .
Approximately one - half of all women giving birth are
eligible for Medicaid . "
This was no small point , even then , in terms of cost
savings .
Part of what ’s sapping Medicaid funds are cesareans and neonatal intensive
care admissions ; the need for both of these procedures can be reduced through increased access to midwives .
" The irony is that
most women whose births are being paid for by taxpayers are being denied this
option , " Katie Prown points out .
The final document put out by the coalition , " Advancing Reproductive Rights and
Health in a New Administration , " which was presented to the Obama - Biden
Transition Team , includes " Support healthy pregnancies " as one of eight major
goals , with three specific recommendations :
boost funding for the Maternal and
Child Health Services Block Grant ,
Child Health Services Block Grant , reinstate birth centers as eligible for
Medicaid reimbursement ( a Bush policy casualty ) , and
Medicaid reimbursement ( a Bush policy casualty ) , and end the shackling of
incarcerated women during labor .
But there is no mention of CPMs ( or any
midwives ) , the cesarean section rate , VBAC access , or home birth , or any
overarching statement on the sorry state of U.S. maternity care in general .
The
same is true of subsequent blueprints for women ’s health reform put out by the
Center for American Progress and Columbia University .
For birth advocates , the outcome was disappointing .
" I was thinking about all
the policies that have driven the over - medicalization of childbirth , " says
Summers .
" The payment system rewards providers for intervention and makes it
difficult to have an out of hospital birth .
And it ’s the workforce decisions
that have led us to have tens of thousands of specialists and six thousand
midwives .
The government funds the vast majority of healthcare education , and
it is disproportionately spent on physician education . "
The disappointment
notwithstanding , it was n’t unexpected .
The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has what it calls a
" longstanding opposition " to
home birth and what it terms " lay " midwives , by which it means any midwife who
is not also a nurse .
Even in response to growing interest and attention to CPMs and home birth , the organization has only dug
its heels in deeper .
" ACOG does not support programs that advocate for , or
individuals who provide , home births , " says its 2007 statement on the subject .
In Missouri , the local physician group tried mightily to block the CPM
legislation , even suing the state over it ( and losing ) .
ACOG argues that the issue is safety , though the research suggests that for
healthy women , planned home birth with a CPM is as safe as a planned hospital
birth , if not safer because of the reduced likelihood of potentially harmful
interventions .
ACOG has also remained neutral on the rise in cesarean section ,
and its policies are directly responsible for the de facto VBAC ban .
Naturally , during the meetings leading up to the blueprint , the ACOG
lobbyist was going to object to any recommendations that would expand the pool
and power of midwives or increase access to home birth .
What ’s perhaps
interesting is that the group listened .
" It was pretty clear that anything contentious
was n’t going to go anywhere , " says Summers .
" The lobbyist did n’t have to say
much , and the group really needed ACOG there , because people on the Hill would
say , ‘ Well , what do the OB / GYNs think ? ’ "

REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE ?
Of course , politicians are n’t necessarily asking
the right questions , but neither are the traditional allies of women ’s health , perhaps because they have
historically been focused on contraception and abortion , to the exclusion of
other related matters , such as wanted pregnancies and childbirth .
Though the
" healthy pregnancies " group was charged with naming top national maternity care
priorities for the new administration , its members came to the table knowing
very little about it .
" There was a learning curve , " says Jessica Arons of the
Center for American Progress , who was part of the group .
Amy Allina of the
National Women ’s Health Network also served on the group and felt the same .
" Most of the groups who where involved do n’t work on childbirth issues , " she
says , and the goals that made the final cut reflected it .
Unshackling imprisoned women while
they ’re in labor is a no- brainer .
The concept of expanding midwifery care takes
longer to digest .
On top of the learning curve , there ’s brand loyalty .
" For the abortion rights
community , doctors are our heroes , " says Jessica Arons .
" Whereas for the
birthing rights community , the medical establishment is driven by malpractice
insurance concerns , and the bottom line of for - profit hospitals , and moving to
C-sections more quickly because they ’re more expedient , and all sorts of
disincentives to providing care that ’s best for women .
So there ’s a tension there . "
There ’s
also a deeper , ideological hurdle .
From the perspective of abortion rights
advocates , medicine and technology are good –they guarantee reproductive
freedom–and physicians who provide abortions protect women from harm .
The goal
is to achieve broader access to care .
From the perspective of birthing rights
advocates , medicine and technology are overused and cause harm , and the goal is
to protect women from unnecessary use of technology during labor and delivery .
Reproductive freedom is further secured by expanding access to midwives and providing support for
physiological birth .
With abortion , there ’s no question as to the standard of care ; with birth , it ’s the care itself that needs questioning .
Arons
says that maternity care issues have been increasingly on the feminist radar ,
especially in recent years as the reproductive rights movement has evolved into
a movement for " reproductive justice . "
In building the pre-Obama women ’s health
coalition , " we wanted to show a commitment to a wider set of issues , including
pregnancy and birthing rights , " she says .
" I think most of us recognize that a
woman ’s ability to have a home birth , or a midwife assisted birth , or being
able to say no to a C - section , that all of those are clearly related to her
ability to decide whether to have an abortion .
It ’s all within the same bundle
of rights –to autonomy and self determination and informed consent and
privacy . "
But birth advocates are frustrated that they do n’t have more support from
groups they perceive as natural allies .
" We ’re not hearing a word from anyone
publicly that birth is an issue that the Democratic Party should embrace , " says
Susan Jenkins , which seems like a tactical error as much as an inconsistency .
Eighty - four percent of American women experience childbirth , more than 4
million a year .
" Making changes in the way birthing care is handled in the U.S .
would be one step that can have an immediate impact on a huge number of
American women , " says Jenkins .
" This could be a huge unifying factor for women across the political
spectrum . "
But reproductive rights groups worry about " issue creep , " that to
expand the agenda to include issues like the cesarean rate or midwives could
water down their effectiveness in preserving abortion rights .
To be fair , the birth community has n’t necessarily organized itself for optimal
influence .
Some of the maternity care groups that were invited to the " healthy
pregnancies " meetings declined the invitation .
A blueprint is due out from the
Childbirth Connection ’s symposium , but not until late this year .
In Washington ,
the American Association of Birth Centers succeeded in getting birth - center Medicaid
eligibility into all the reform bills ; and the Big Push for Midwives and MAMA
campaign are undoubtedly creating buzz
about the potential cost and health savings of midwives and out - of - hospital
birth .
But each is doing so separately , without the power of a coalition .
" There ’s a long list of groups that
care about these issues , " says Lisa Summers .
" But there ’s never been an
effective coalition for maternity care in DC . "
Which raises another question : even if these groups
could join forces behind one
blueprint , could it stand up to ACOG ?
ACOG wields tremendous authority in Washington .
And while it can be counted on
to protect women ’s right to terminate a pregnancy , the group is actively trying
to limit women ’s rights in choosing how , where , and with whom they give birth ,
and actively opposing policy changes that would directly benefit women and
their families .
It ’s likely that the coalition of women ’s health groups did n’t
anticipate the politics involved when it organized the " healthy pregnancies "
team .
It certainly put these feminist groups in the awkward position of
facilitating what could be considered some very " un-feminist " advocacy .
" Reproductive
justice is the recognition that all women–not just those ending their
pregnancies , but also those who decide to go to term–need to be protected from
punitive , ineffective , and unhealthy policies , " says Lynn Paltrow of the
National Advocates for Pregnant Women .
" To advance policies that are protecting
pregnant women who are going to term advances reproductive justice . "
The flip
side , of course , is that to acquiesce to policies that harm pregnant women
undermines it .
That
said , the coalition itself is a huge achievement , and the fact that pregnancy
and birth issues made it into the
blueprint represents a major victory for birth advocates .
But what now ?
Now that this country is trying to envision a more just and economical health
care system , and the women ’s health community is positioned to influence its
development ?
It would seem that if the reproductive justice movement recognizes
that birthing rights are cut from the same cloth as abortion rights , then it
should be working harder for them .
And that means , for starters , reconciling
its conflicting interests with ACOG .
Perhaps it ’s not so different than a woman
standing up to her doctor : she risks being branded " difficult , " but in the end ,
it ’s her body , her choice .
None of the competitors would admit to taking performance - enhancing drugs .
" This is absolutely not allowed .
All the competitors here have been tested .
There is no doubt that today none of these men are using the drugs .
We fine anyone who 's found using them 50,000 afs ( $ 1,000 ) , " said Farhid Ahmad Sediqi , head of Afghanistan 's union for sport and athletics

The prowess of Chinese engineers has resulted in another Middle Kingdom marvel , in the form of this spectacular building collapse ; so expert was the construction of the structure ’s foundations that the collapse occurred cleanly and without much damage to the structure , breaking neatly at the base .
The structure itself was a 13 - storey Shanghai apartment building , still under construction , built alongside a number of identical developments , the owners of which are likely eyeing their own foundations with no small trepidation .
Investigations into cause of the collapse are ongoing , though it hardly takes much insight to realise the likely reason .
Only one worker was horribly crushed when the structure fell , as nobody had yet moved in .
Such innovative construction techniques are said to be typical throughout China , a nation whose superficially impressive economic foundations also at times look as unstable and ephemeral as some of the buildings …

Want to open your own medical marijuana collective in unincorporated San Mateo County ?
In a few weeks , you ’ll have to fill out an application , pay a $ 100 fee and submit to inspections to make sure your club is in line with all the terms of the county ’s new ordinance governing the collectives .
Buck those requirements and you may soon have the sheriff ’s office knocking at your door .
The county ’s first - ever ordinance governing pot clubs goes into effect on July 6 , and county officials are trying to hash out how the process to license the collectives will work .
Aspiring distributors will likely have to fill out an application form , which has not been finalized but will include questions to make sure the collective is in line with the ordinance ’s various restrictions .
Under the law , which supervisors approved on April 28 , cooperatives must be at least 1,000 feet away from a school , recreation center or youth center ; install an alarm system and window bars ; refrain from advertising or having any marijuana visible from the street ; and must not distribute edible cannabis products , among other provisions .
Once the application is turned in , the sheriff ’s office and the county ’s building departments will inspect the collective ’s building for compliance , said Deborah Penny Bennett , a chief deputy county counsel .
If the collective passes that step , the county ’s three - member licensing board will have the final say on whether the club can operate .
The ordinance covers only the county ’s unincorporated area , though there are already at least three clubs in the North Fair Oaks neighborhood near Redwood City .
The founders of one club , the Universal Healthcare Cooperative , have criticized the ordinance for banning edibles and have been in ongoing talks with the county about the ordinance ’s terms .
Sheriff ’s office spokesman Tom Merson said officials have not been in contact with the other two clubs — Blue Heaven and the California Patients Cooperative .
The county plans to deliver applications to each of the cooperatives , though they wo n’t be expected to have their licenses approved by July 6 .
The next county licensing board meeting is in early August , Merson said .
“ After the license application forms are available , they would have a reasonable time to turn them in , ” Bennett said .
“ Certainly we would expect people to be under way with the application process by July 6 . ”
If clubs refuse to fill out an application or comply with the ordinance ’s terms
“ They ’d be shut down , ” Merson said .

Summary Paul Hudak explores the question whether the elegance of functional programming is a good match for the aesthetics of art ?
Is it possible that artists could benefit from using functional languages in their work ?
In addition to the creative process , can functional languages assist artists in other ways ?
We will explore many of these issues in the context of the visual , musical , and performing arts .

A LIFE education program created by an organisation with ties to anti-abortion groups in Australia and the United States was endorsed by the NSW Education Department for use in public schools .
But since the links were raised by the Herald , the department has banned the group from visiting schools and announced a review of the processes that led to its approval .
The Wonder of Life ( Before Birth ) was approved by the NSW Department of Education and Training in March to be taught in years 5 and 6 as part of the personal development , health and physical education curriculum .
However the program 's creator , Bruce Coleman , has strong links to anti-abortion groups here and in the US .
Mr Coleman is a former executive director of the anti-abortion lobby group , NSW Right to Life , a member of the management committee of Fred Nile 's Christian Democratic Party , and an unsuccessful CDP candidate at the 2004 election .
In an interview with the Herald , Mr Coleman said the program was " very much biology " , that he " does n't get involved in the politics at all " and does not mention abortion " in the primary context " because it is " not appropriate " .
However , when abortion is raised , he responds by " explaining to them the value of life .
I just state clearly that abortion is the taking of an unborn life " , he said .
Mr Coleman 's company , The Choices of Life Incorporated , is the Australian distributor of anti-abortion merchandise marketed by the US company Heritage House , some of which , such as a range of life - sized foetal dolls , is used in the program for NSW schools .

To all staff :
We had to let our cleaning crew go for budget reasons .
In a separate e-mail , I will explain our new ' Adopt a toilet ' program .
Dilbert says , " I have to be honest , Timmy .
I do n't see college in your future . "
Angel Hernandez getting ready to work a game behind the plate .
( Icon / SMI )
The strike zone is that area over home plate the upper limit of which is a horizontal line at the midpoint between the top of the shoulders and the top of the uniform pants , and the lower level is a line at the hollow beneath the knee cap .
The strike zone shall be determined from the batter ’s stance as the batter is prepared to swing at a pitched ball .
In theory it is a simple rule .
In practice it is much much harder than that .
There are more arguments with umpires over the strike zone than any other call by a huge margin .
The sheer volume of calls the umpire has to make behind the plate means that more than likely over the course of a game a batter or a pitcher is going to see a pitch differently than the umpire .
This makes calling balls and strikes the most important job of any umpire .
Because of this , in recent years automated systems have been put in place to see how umpires are doing behind the plate .
In 2001 , QuesTec camera system was put in place in 11 stadiums to track umpire calls .
In 2008 , a PITCHf / x camera system was installed in every major league park and gathered data on almost every pitch thrown ( around 700,000 pitches ) .
These data are what Major League Baseball Advanced Media ( MLBAM ) uses for its gameday feature and is accurate to about a half an inch near home plate .
The findings are put online for anyone who wants to study them .
It did n’t take long for people to start using this , and other data , to start studying umpires and how good a job they really do calling balls and strikes .
Here at THT John Walsh helped pioneer this research , defining an actual strike zone for left - and right - handed batters and many others have followed suit with other excellent studies .
Another study by Hamermesh , et. al. , looked at the effect of race of the pitcher and umpire on the percentage of strikes called and found that the umpires were indeed slightly racially biased .
This study sparked a lot of reaction and further examination , the best of which came from Phil Birnbaum at his blog .
He noted that because the number of African American and Latino umpires was small , most or all of the significance came from umpires Laz Diaz and Angel Hernandez .
This sparked debate at Tom Tango ’s site , where everyone seemed to agree that Hernandez was a bad umpire .
In fact , there ’s even an anti-Hernandez anti-fan page and he certainly has seen his share of controversy in his time as an umpire , much of this revolving around his high strike percentage .
So :
If everyone seems to think that Hernandez is a poor umpire and we now have data on almost every pitch he has called , then we now should be able to statistically verify or refute this .
Welcome to the world of PITCHf / x
The PITCHf / x camera system takes about 25 pictures of the ball in flight between the mound and home plate .
Sportvision then runs a best fit algorithm and reports the flight of the ball as a parabola in each of the three dimensions .
From this path , different variables can be calculated and studied , including two variables that report the position of the ball when it cross the front of home plate .
These variables , which are reported in the data as x ( horizontal ) and z ( vertical ) , can then be plotted along with the umpire ’s call for the pitch .
Here is an example of straight out of the box data for Angel Hernandez from his perspective .
Again , this view is from behind home plate , so a right - handed batter is standing around - 18 inches .
Only pitches that were called balls or strikes are plotted and intentional balls have been removed .
The strike zone is inflated by the radius of the ball to represent any part of the ball crossing any part of the plate as being a strike .
I ’ve superimposed the MLB - defined strike zone for a player of average height in black and the best fit strike zone for Hernandez in blue .
I obtained that by drawing the rectangle that had the least amount of errors ( called strikes outside the box and called balls inside the box ) .
Straight out of the box things are n’t looking good for Hernandez ; he appears to have a wide zone , especially outside , to both left - and right - handed batters and hardly ever calls pitches at the knees strikes .
In addition , there is a smattering of strikes high out of the zone and many balls inside the upper portion of the strike zone .
Identifying the top and bottom of Ryan Howard ’s strike zone is easier said than done .
( Icon / SMI )
You may have noticed a couple of problems with the data out of the box , however .
The most glaring is that batters come in different sizes , so what is a strike to one may be a ball to another .
To help with this issue , when a batter steps to home plate a person working for Sportvision — called a stringer — will identify where the top and bottom of the strike zone is and report that in the data .
This would be perfect if the stringers would report the same numbers each time a batter steps to the plate , but sadly these numbers can really jump around .
To try to minimize statistical error , the best method is to average each at - bat for a hitter and use that number for all his at - bats .
When you do that , you can see how big of a difference this can make .
Once we have a fixed strike zone for each hitter , we can normalize all the data to a league average height , thus fixing any problems with the top and bottom of the strike zone .
As far as I know , John Walsh was the first to use this , in the articles I have linked above .
Now we are getting somewhere , but there still is another problem with the data .
Home plate is n’t just a simple plane like a window .
It is a complicated , three - dimensional object ( kind of like a house that has fallen on its side ) .
A pitch that is n’t over the plate at the front can still move over the plate near the back .
Here is a great example of such a pitch by Andy Sonnanstine pitching to Jorge Posada with Angel Hernandez behind the plate from the top down .
Here the plate has n’t been enlarged and the width of the curve is the actual diameter of a baseball .
The y position , which is on the x axis here , has values near 55 feet because around 55 feet from home plate is where the camera system begins to report the ball ( I did n’t come up with this naming / numbering scheme ; I am just using it ) .
Here the ball is not over the plate at the front but narrowly scrapes home plate near the back .
Angel Henandez correctly called this pitch a strike .
You might be thinking this is a small effect that ca n’t possible matter .
Well , at the front of the plate the middle of the ball is over two inches away from the edge of the plate .
If you look back at the two plots of Hernandez ’s calls to left and right handed batters you can see that Hernandez appears to be generous on the corners of the plate by a little more than two inches .
Clearly , if you want to look at umpires in detail just looking at the front of the plate is n’t going to be enough .
Method for corrections
Any part of the ball that crosses any part of the plate .*
* From a Little League umpire whose husband e-mailed me discussing the accuracy of a strike zone tracker used by a local broadcast team .
Asking even a very accurate tracking system like PITCHf / x to determine if any part of a sphere crossed any part of a crazy seven - sided , three - dimensional object that changes from batter to batter is not an easy task .
The best way to attack the problem is to increase the size of the strike zone by the radius of the ball .
Then , the sphere becomes a curve .
Now asking where that curve crossed a plane of the strike zone is an easier task , but we would like to do better than that .
Ideally , we would like to present the data in a nice graphical format like the left - and right - handed plots above .
We can reduce the problem back into two dimensions by reporting the point where the ball came closest to the strike zone if it did n’t actual enter the zone or the point of deepest penetration for balls that did enter the strike zone .
This reduces to a three - dimensional minimization / maximization problem that still would make a Calculus III student wince , but can be done on a computer in a reasonable amount of time .
Using these minimums / maximums and normalizing for the changing height of the strike zone , we come up with these two plots for Hernandez .
Again , the MLB - defined strike zone is in black and the best fit strike zone for Hernandez is in blue .
After these adjustments , things look a lot better for Hernandez .
This top of the strike zone as defined by MLB and Hernandez ’s top are almost in complete agreement .
The inside corner ( negative for RHB positive for LHB ) is also almost perfect .
While Hernandez is still calling strikes a few inches off the outside corner , this too has been reduced .
You will notice that many of these called strikes that are slightly off the plate now appear to be low in the zone .
The reason for this is pitches almost always are falling as they reach home plate .
If a pitch is slightly off home plate horizontally but moving in toward home plate when it crosses the front , the point where the ball is closest to the plate will be at the back of the plate when the ball has dropped some .
If , however , the ball already started at the knees , this will cause the ball to move further away from home plate even if it is getting closer horizontally .
So a ball at the knees when it crosses the front of the plate probably is already near its closest point , while a ball at the letters probably wo n’t reach its closest point until the back of the plate .
Because the adjustment at the knees is small , the gap between the MLB strike zone and Hernandez ’s strike zone still remains .
This is n’t too surprising , since it was exactly what John Walsh found in his original study .
I do want to point out here that we are relying on the Sportvision stringers to determine the top and bottom of the zone , and while we already have corrected any statistical errors they might have made , they might be systematically reporting a lower value than the rules suggest .
In any case , this is about a two - inch difference for left - handed batters and about three inches for right - handed batters .
Analyzing the results
If you do this for all umpires , then you can start studying them as a group .
You can ask how often they correctly identify a pitch compared to the MLB rule definition ( accuracy ) , how often they correctly identify a pitch compared with their personal strike zone ( precision ) , and how large these strike zones are compared to the MLB strike zones ( size ) for both left - and right - handed batters .
When you do this , the first thing that jumps out at you is just how accurate and precise major league umpires are as a group .
While they tend to give the outside corner a bit too much and are a bit stingy near the top and bottom , for the most part a pitch over the plate is called a strike and almost always a pitch that is thrown within a specific umpire ’s zone is called a strike .
Of the 82 umpires who were behind the plate when the PITCHf / x cameras were working last year , even the least consistent was very consistent .
When you focus in on Angel Hernandez specifically , you find that he grades out as an above - average umpire in each metric of even - handedness .
No matter how you slice it , looking at the 2008 PITCHf / x data , Hernandez is a quality umpire among an already amazing group .
While he does n’t get every call right , he gets the vast majority correct and his strike zone hardly varies from game to game .
A teenage actor from the Harry Potter films was charged on Tuesday with illegally growing 10 cannabis plants , British police said , shortly before the world premiere of the latest movie .
Jamie Waylett , 19 , who plays schoolboy bully Vincent Crabbe , will appear at Westminster Magistrates Court in central London on July 16 " charged with producing a class B drug , namely 10 plants of cannabis " , police said .
Waylett , from north London , appears as the overweight , greedy and dim - witted side - kick of villain Draco Malfoy in all of the films about boy wizard Harry .
The charge was announced just hours before the Potter stars walked up the red carpet in London for the world premiere of the sixth film , Harry Potter and the Half - Blood Prince .
The pre-release buzz suggests the new movie will add a sizeable chunk to the $ US4.5 billion ( $ 5.65 billion ) in box office receipts already earned by the successful Potter movie franchise .

Muzorama : A Disturbingly Surreal Trip Through a Very Bizarre World
Muzorama is an absolutely brilliant 3 - min. short 3D animation film based on the surreal universe of the French illustrator Muzo ; the film was a Siggraph 2009 official selection .
Jean - Philippe Masson ( Muzo ) is a French Artist born in Rennes in 1960 .
Muzorama is a suspiciously innocent little film , it ’s like flipping through an evil , maccabre “ Little Golden Book ” on acid !
The film ’s deeply disturbing , but creative as hell !
It ’s so weirdly strange , but you just wo n’t be able to take your eyes off of it .

On CLOUD nine
The CLOUD team will be able to recreate the conditions of any part of the atmosphere inside the new chamber , from the polar stratosphere to the low level tropics .
The new chamber arrives in the East Hall .
Once carefully cleaned the chamber will be turned sideways onto its legs ready for the beam of ‘ cosmic rays ’ .
The link between cosmic rays and climate change is one that has been hotly debated over the past decade , grabbing the attention of the media .
The idea revolves around the possibility that particles entering the atmosphere from space can affect cloud formation , which in turn affects the climate .
But despite the controversy surrounding the theory , the central question – ‘ do cosmic rays help create clouds ? ’ – has barely been tested in a laboratory before .
The CLOUD ( Cosmics Leaving OUtdoor Droplets ) experiment here at CERN will be one of the first experiments in the world directly to test the effect of cosmic rays on cloud formation under controllable laboratory conditions .
The experiment ’s three - metre diameter aerosol / cloud chamber arrived on Wednesday 20 May .
This crucial piece of the experiment will be used to recreate carefully various conditions in the atmosphere .
The chamber is the culmination of three years ’ research and design since the experiment was first approved in 2006 .
After being fitted with an array of sensitive analysing instruments , it will be carefully cleaned , tested and calibrated .
The team hope to start collecting data later this year .
" I think the evidence for a link between reconstructions of past climate change and solar activity is too strong to ignore , " explains Jasper Kirkby , Spokesperson for the CLOUD experiment .
" There are a lot of observations showing that variations of the sun seem to be affecting the climate , but we do n’t yet know what the mechanism for this is . "
" The aim of CLOUD is to understand whether or not cosmic rays can affect clouds and climate , by studying the microphysical interactions of cosmic rays with aerosols , cloud droplets and ice particles . "
This is one of the possible mechanisms for solar - climate variability since the solar wind – the stream of charged particles ejected from the sun – varies over time and affects the intensity of the cosmic rays that reach the Earth .
" The whole process is well understood except for whether or not cosmic rays do indeed affect clouds .
If that process can be established then I think solar - climate variability will very rapidly change from being a controversial subject to one with a lot of respectability .
If , on the other hand , we rule out the process then this will allow us to focus on other mechanisms that might be causing the link , " continues Kirkby .
A beam from the Proton Synchrotron is used to create a beam of ‘ artificial cosmic rays ’ .
These can be carefully controlled and aimed into the new chamber , which is bristling with sensors like spectrometers , ice - crystal detectors and CCD cameras .
With the addition of a thermal housing and control system next year the team will be able to recreate the conditions of any part of the atmosphere inside the chamber , from the polar stratosphere to the low level tropics .
" We can carefully control what is inside the chamber , but we can also control the cosmic rays , " say Kirkby .
Being able to test under controllable conditions is what makes CLOUD different from atmospheric observations .
" If you measure something directly in the atmosphere then you can never be certain what caused it as there are so many changing variables to take into account . "
Cloud formation strongly depends on certain trace gases in the atmosphere , and their concentrations inside the chamber need to be controlled precisely .
So one of the big challenges is to make the chamber as clean as possible , which has involved CERN experts who are used to dealing with ultrahigh vacuum components for the accelerators .
" But even by CERN standards , the CLOUD requirements are challenging .
We control the concentrations of certain gases to better than one part per trillion , which is 4 - 6 orders of magnitude below what is necessary for most particle physics liquid or gaseous detectors " .
This is the first time a particle accelerator has been used to study atmospheric and climate science and CLOUD therefore lies at an intersection between several different disciplines .
The team includes atmospheric physicists and chemists , solar physicists , cosmic - ray physicists and particle physicists .
" CLOUD has a world - class experimental team , bringing together the leading aerosol and cloud physicists in Europe and America " , says Kirkby .
" Working on an interdisciplinary experiment is certainly exciting .
Particle physics and atmospheric physics tend to approach things differently - there is almost a cultural difference .
Particle physicists are always happier to look at the simplest , most fundamental systems , whereas most atmospheric and climate physicists approach from one of the most complex systems possible – namely the atmosphere and climate . "
In fact , the team come from such a variety of disciplines that the Universities of Geneva and Lausanne have initiated a sociological PhD project on CLOUD to observe how interdisciplinary collaborations work .

N Korea 's nuclear test and missile launches have caused concern North Korea is reportedly moving closer to launching another long - range missile , despite international concern .
South Korean media say the North has moved its most advanced missile to a new launch site on the west coast .
US Defense Secretary Robert Gates said there were signs of work being done on a long - range missile , but he said the North 's intentions were not yet clear .
A regional summit has convened in South Korea to discuss the North 's recent nuclear and missile tests .
After the opening day of the summit , the leaders there agreed that North Korea 's recent nuclear test was a " provocation " which " seriously undermines peace and stability in north - east Asia and the world , " according to South Korea 's presidential office .
' No sail ' zone North Korea could fire the missile as early as 16 June , according to the Dong -a Ilbo and JoongAng Ilbo newspapers .
The missile is believed to be a version of the Taepodong - 2 rocket which was fired on 5 April .
It has a range of up to 6,500 km ( 4,000 miles ) , the JoongAng Ilbo reported , which would put Alaska within striking range .
According to South Korea 's Yonhap news agency , the missile has been moved to the Dongchang - ni launch base , about 65 km ( 40 miles ) from the Chinese border .
The Chosun Ilbo added that North Korea had also designated a large area off its west coast a " no- sail " zone until the end of July .
Other reports say there has been increased activity around military bases in the area and that troops have been ordered to increase their stocks of ammunition .
Monday 's newspaper reports said North Korea 's construction of the new launch site at Dongchang - ni was now near to completion .
South Korea is hosting a regional summit at Seogwipo , S Korea Previous long - range missiles have been fired from a site on the country 's north - east coast .
The North Koreans may believe the new test site 's location in the north - west , close to the Chinese border , makes it less vulnerable to attack , says the BBC's Chris Hogg in Seoul .
Regional fears
The international community is becoming increasingly concerned with North Korea 's actions .
On 5 April , the North launched a long - range rocket which flew over Japan before crashing into the Pacific Ocean , drawing intense international criticism .
Last Monday it carried out an underground nuclear test , and then tested a series of short - range missiles .
ESCALATING TENSIONS 27 May - North Korea says it is abandoning the truce that ended the Korean war and reportedly test - fires another missile 26 May - The North test - fires short - range missiles as South Korea announces it will join a US - led initiative to control trafficking in weapons of mass destruction 26 May - President Barack Obama pledges military support for America 's East Asian allies , as the UN condemns the nuclear test 25 May - North Korea stages its second nuclear test , triggering international condemnation 29 April - Pyongyang threatens to carry out a nuclear test unless the UN apologises for criticising its recent rocket launch 14 April - Pyongyang says it is ending talks on its nuclear activities and will restore its disabled nuclear reactor after UN criticism of its rocket launch 5 April - The North goes ahead with a controversial rocket launch , seen by major governments as a cover for a long - range missile test
Q&A : North Korea nuclear test
What is N Korea 's game plan ?
Further heightening tensions between the US and North Korea is the start of the trial in Pyongyang on Thursday of two American journalists , Laura Ling and Euna Lee , accused of entering the country illegally and engaging in " hostile acts " .
After meeting US Deputy Secretary of State Jim Steinberg in Tokyo , Japanese Vice Foreign Minister Mitoji Yabunaka said : " We absolutely cannot accept that North Korea will have nuclear weapons " .
Mr Steinberg called Pyongyang 's recent actions " highly destabilising " .
Hosting a summit of South - East Asian leaders in Seogwipo , South Korea , President Lee Myung - bak warned the North against further provocative acts .
" If North Korea turns its back on dialogue and peace and dares to carry out military threats and provocations , the Republic of Korea [ South Korea ] will never tolerate that , " he said .
Our correspondent says the gathering offers an opportunity to Mr Lee to shore up support for the fact he has taken a tougher stance against North Korea than his predecessor did .
The hardline North , under President Kim Jong-il , has threatened military action against the South after Seoul 's decision to join a US - led security initiative under which North Korean ships could be stopped and searched .
Pyongyang says Seoul 's decision to join the PSI is tantamount to an act of war .
US and South Korean troops are currently on high alert after the North said it was no longer bound by the truce that ended the Korean war in 1953 .

Detectives set up a sting to bust Prostitutes using Craigslist to sell their services online .
Fifteen - year - old Shauny is trying to make up her mind whether to have sex for the first time .
She has been seeing her boyfriend for three months and is conscious they are becoming more physically intimate .
But as she approaches 16 , the legal age of consent , she is not sure whether she is ready to have sex .
Her close childhood friend , Riah , is also a virgin .
Together the two took part in a BBC
Three documentary that set out to give them a better understanding of the issues .
Accompanied by their mums , Shauny and Riah set out on a 2,000 mile road trip in Britain and the Netherlands , where they were introduced to various " sexperts " , as well as situations to get the families talking openly and honestly about sex .
' People pleaser '
Single mum Debbie prides herself on her close relationship with Shauny , but has been struggling with the fact that her eldest daughter is growing up and wants to have her boyfriend over to stay .
The only thing that 's stopping me is what could happen afterwards
Shauny
She fears that Shauny may enter a sexual relationship before she is ready and thinks that 16 is still too young .
More than a quarter of young Britons claim to have lost their virginity illegally and in the last 20 years , the number of sexually active girls under the age of consent has risen from one in 20 to one in three .
But are these teenagers really informed about the implications of their decision ?
" Shauny 's a people pleaser , " says Debbie .
" I think if she was n't quite ready and he really wanted to she 'd go ahead with it . "
Sex ' workshop '
Shauny has an open mind and is keen to understand every aspect of being in a sexual relationship Being safe is foremost in her mind .
" The only thing that 's stopping me , " she admits , " is what could happen afterwards . "
Riah and Shauny have known each other since they were seven Shauny gets a lesson in " safe sex " at the Longbenton Youth Project in Essex called Great Sexpectations .
The teacher , Kelly , uses role play , with oven gloves and beer goggles as props , to demonstrate how drinking alcohol limits the ability to have safe sex .
Despite the inevitable , uncontrollable fits of giggles throughout Kelly 's workshop , Shauny feels reassured by the practical nature of the session , which among other things shows her how a condom is put on .
" I think having more knowledge will help and if I do get into another heated situation with my boyfriend , it might help me decide . "
Girls and boys
Although her boyfriend is not putting pressure on her to have sex , Shauny wants to understand more about how boys view sex and what they expect .
To enable the girls to gain more of an insight , a group of 15 and 16 - year - old boys gather to talk openly to Shauny and Riah about their concerns .
I did n't know boys could be so sensitive
Riah Shauny asks the group : " How many of you guys would wear a condom ?
Or would you prefer your girlfriend to take the pill ? "
" Sex is something that is happening with both people , " replies one of the teenagers , " so it should n't just be put on the girl to take the pill . "
Another boy says he thinks the pill is a big step for a girl , so a condom would be a lot easier .
Before they met the boys , Shauny and Riah were sceptical about what they might hear , but they came out of it pleasantly surprised by the boys ' attitude .
" I did n't know boys could be so sensitive , " says Riah .
' Netherlands - style '
The girls ' mums are delighted that the meeting with the boys has helped them feel more comfortable , but perhaps the biggest hurdle on the road trip is making the mums themselves feel more at ease about discussing sex with their daughters .
In Amsterdam they meet a Dutch mum and her 16 - year - old daughter who recently lost her virginity .
I 'm ashamed ...
I should have been stronger
Shauny 's mum , Debbie Holland has the lowest teenage pregnancy rate and the lowest rates of sexually transmitted infections in western Europe .
Britain has almost the highest .
Despite a very open attitude to sex , teenagers in Holland start having sex on average one year later than in the UK .
Shauny 's mum Debbie asks the Dutch mum : " When she told you that she 'd lost her virginity , how did you feel about it ? "
" I was very happy that she had a very nice first time , " she replies .
" We talk about everything . "
This meeting has a big impact on Shauny , Riah and their mums .
" I 'm seriously thinking now that I should trust Shauny and say , ' If you want your boyfriend to stay over , then fine ' , " says Debbie .
Debbie 's first time Before leaving Holland , Shauny and Debbie meet with therapist and sexologist Sanderijn van der Deof .
Sanderijn believes that sex should be a normal topic of conversation when children are growing up , so that by the time they reach their teens , there will already be a dialogue between them .
She tries to encourage Debbie to open up to her daughter about her own first sexual experience .
" I 'm ashamed , " sobs Debbie , " I should have been stronger . "
Shauny 's eyes well up as her mother struggles to describe how she slept with a boy for the first time because she was scared that he would not like her if she refused .
And the next morning how he laughed at Debbie in front of a group of their friends .
" The only other fear stronger than my fear of rejection , " she says , " is my fear of you having to go through what I 've been through I do n't want that for you . "
As the eventful journey comes to an end , Shauny has heard enough to make up her mind .
" I 'm going to wait until I know for a fact that I 'm ready , " she says .
" I 'm going to wait whether it means I wait till I 'm 20 . "
Turning to her mum she continues : " After hearing everything you told me about your experience and after doing all this stuff over the past few days , it just me realise that the longer you wait , most likely the better it 's going to be . "
" My boyfriend knows that it 'll happen when we 're both ready and he 'll wait as long as it takes and if he does n't - that 's it , he 's gone . "
Riah also decides she will wait , because she feels she lacks confidence in herself and wants to concentrate on making a close relationship work first .

A music publisher that says Australian band Men At Work stole a melody from a children 's song in hit Down Under has won the first stage of a court battle .
Larrikin claims the flute riff from the 1981 hit is stolen from Kookaburra sits in the Old Gum Tree , written by Marion Sinclair for the Girl Guides in 1934 .
The band disputed Larrikin 's claim that it bought the song 's copyright in 1990 .
But a judge in Sydney has ruled that the publisher does own the song , clearing the way for a plagiarism case .

On June 7th , 2008 Sarah Palin interrupted her schedule of state business and spent Alaska state taxpayer money to fly up to Juneau to the Mat - Su Valley where she attended on June 8th two religious events dominated by the Wasilla Assembly of God , which is demonstrably Palin 's key Alaska church .
At the end of one those events , young adults in a church Palin had attended for over two decades were presented with Samurai swords .
" Warriors of old were considered undressed if they were without their sword ...
Swords were worn in service to the lord of the realm .
Some of the most renowned swordsmen were the Samurai , " intoned a church member officiating the sword ceremony , who then quoted Psalms 149 verses 6 - 9 :
" May the praise of God be in their mouths and a double edged sword in their hands to inflict vengeance on the nations , and punishment on the peoples , and to bind their kings with fetters , their nobles with shackles of iron , and to carry out the sentence written against them . "
In the lead up to the November 4th , 2008 presidential election there was an almost total failure , of not only mainstream but also alternative media and even bloggers , to inform the American voting public about the very specific and militant nature of the Christian religious tendency Sarah Palin was demonstrably heavily linked to .
In one of the two ceremonies Palin attended on June 8 , 2008 , known as " One Lord Sunday " , a Christian supremacist gathering of Mat - Su valley area Christian church members , Palin was blessed and anointed by Wasilla Assembly of God head pastor Ed Kalnins .
A second ceremony Palin attended that day was nationally publicized for footage on the Wasilla church 's website that showed Palin giving a speech in honor of students graduating from the Wasilla Assembly of God 's Masters Commission program .
In the speech , governor Palin effused , " It was so cool growing up in this church ! " and went on to suggest the US military presence in Iraq and Afghanistan was sanctioned by God , and the governor .
And Palin was prayed and blessed over by Ed Kalnins and Wasilla Assembly of God Paul Riley .
But media did not delve into the nature of the Masters Commission program , nor reporters and journalists , or bloggers for that matter , bother to watch the video segment of the June 8th , 2008 Wasilla AoG video segment in full .
Anyone who bothered to do so would have noticed , later on in the ceremony , 1 ) a speaker addressing Palin from the stage , indicating she was still in the audience and , shortly after , a ceremony in which male 3 - year Masters Commission students were presented with Samurai swords , in a ceremony which mentioned the Samurai code of honor .
Special note made of the specific uses of the Samurai swords gifted to the students , such as cutting down opponents from horseback , ground - level combat , and in very close combat - as an auxiliary blade to be plucked out for a sudden , killing blow .
The one female 3 - year graduate of the program present in the ceremony was presented with a western - style broadsword that also was larger than the Samurai swords presented to the male students .
[ below : 3 - year graduates of Masters Commission Wasilla Alaska program given swords ]
Other video to be found on the Wasilla church 's web site , from a September 7 , 2007 Masters Commission event at the Wasilla Assembly God , shows a national Masters Commission speaker waving a sword about from the pulpit while addressing students in the program , then playing an excerpt from the Mel Gibson movie " The Patriot " and suggesting to the program students that there are times when it is necessary to fight .
[ below : Masters Commission national speaker Jayme Montera waves sword about during sermon , plays clip from Mel Gibson war movie " The Patriot " ]
From September through to November 4th , 2008 , there was an almost uniform failure , by not only mainstream media and progressive media but also bloggers , to notice such unusual and highly distinctive characteristics of Palin 's religious associations .
It was more than a trivial oversight ; following the election , a story printed in the February 2009 issue of Charisma Magazine confirmed Palin 's continuing association with Alaska religious leader Mary Glazier .
Glazier is a high level leader in a religious movement known as the New Apostolic Reformation ( NAR ) .
She and Sarah Palin prayed together , both over the phone and in person , the Charisma story revealed .
On June 13 , 2008 Mary Glazier told attendees at the " Opening the Gate of Heaven on Earth " conference , who represented many of the New Apostolic Reformation 's top leaders , that ,
" There is a tipping point , at which , at which time , because of the sin of the land , the people then have to be displaced ....
God is preparing a people to displace the ones whose sin is rising so that then they tip over and the church goes in - one is removed and the church moves in and takes the territory .
Now , that does not mean that the people are removed , because God removes them from the Kingdom of Darkness into the Kingdom of Light .
They are given an opportunity to change allegiances . "
Later in the speech , Mary Glazier described how she had been present at the inception of Sarah Palin 's political career and that Palin was in her personal prayer group :
" There was a twenty - four year old woman that God began to speak to about entering into politics .
She became a part of our prayer group out in Wasilla .
Years later , became the mayor of Wasilla .
And last year was elected Governor of the state of Alaska .
Yes !
Hallelujah !
At her inauguration she dedicated the state to Jesus Christ .
Hallelujah !
Hallelujah ! "
On January 7 , 2009 , both Mary Glazier and another key Third Wave and New Apostolic leader , Dutch Sheets , appeared at the church most closely linked to Sarah Palin , the Wasilla Assembly of God , where Palin was re-baptized and attended for over two and a half decades .
During the church service Sheets declared that Glazier " was the lady who brought us into the state [ Alaska ] . "
On June 7 , 2009 another New Apostolic Reformation leader , International Coalition of Apostles member Lance Wallnau , gave a talk at the Wasilla church , in which he outlined the " Seven Mountains Mandate . "
The July 12 - 14 , 2008 Opening the Gate of Heaven on Earth conference that featured a number of speeches and sermons -- on the plans of leaders of the New Apostolic Reformation to take control of society and government through their " Seven Mountains Strategy . "
These efforts to take control of religion , family , education , arts and entertainment , media , government , and business are clearly defined in their publicity and in numerous conferences on their efforts .
In an October 16 , 2005 Wasilla Assembly of God church event , in a speech given shortly before he blessed and anointed Sarah Palin , Thomas Muthee quite plainly laid out the need to take over the seven " kingdoms " in the short sermon , or speech , Muthee gave before the anointing of Sarah Palin .
Loren Cunningham is credited as one of three evangelists who supposedly received the Seven Mountains idea as a vision from God.
Cunningham is founder of the global evangelizing organization Youth With a Mission , which owns the increasingly notorious " C Street House " where GOP Senators John Ensign and Tom Coburn enjoy cut -rate rent and Bible classes , and swap personal secrets such as news of Ensign 's recently disclosed extramarital affair .
This is going to be another non-traditional post .
I ’m away from home all this week , so I did n’t have a chance to try any of the many many beers I picked up last week at Dogfish Head .
I still wanted to update , though , because I keep telling myself that regular updates will eventually lead to some kind of following .
Unless you ’ve been ignoring the media - and if you have I envy you - you ’re aware of Henry Louis Gates ’ recent run-in with the law / future run-in with the President .
Apparently all you need to do to sit down with the President for a beer is get arrested .
Good to know …
Anyway , I heard on the news this morning that the three men have chosen ‘ Red , Lite , & Blue ’ ( lucky pun , newsies ) , or specifically : Red Stripe , Bud Light , and Blue Moon .
I cried a little .
Not only are these selections entirely uninteresting or - in the ironic case of Bud Light - undrinkable , but they ’re not even technically American .
Red Stripe is a Jamaican Import , Budweiser is owned by Belgian giant InBev , and Blue Moon comes from Molson - Coors up in Toronto , Canada .
So much for the good ole ’
“ Red White & Blue . ”
So , in response , here are my three picks .
Red :
A modern , California take on the traditional Irish style , Hop Head Red is simply that .
Sort of a Red , sort of an IPA .
A big caramel malt backbone keeps the citrusy hops from overwhelming the flavor , and a high - for - a - red - ale 6.4 % ABV beefs up the character a bit .
If you ’re looking for an old school beer that sticks to its generations old recipe , do n’t go for this .
But if you ’re an IPA fan in the mood for something to break the monotony of all the hop - juice flowing off the west coast , grab yourself a Hop Head Red .
White :
It was a tough decision between this and Sam Adams ’ Imperial White Ale , but in the end I have to go with the Allagash .
Imperial
White is delicious , but it ’s a bit outrageous .
This brew , on the other hand , is a spot - on American recreation of the age - old Belgian Witbeer .
Unfiltered , it pours a fizzy , cloudy orange .
Like most wits , it has a barely existent hop character and spice aromas of citrus , clove , coriander , and pepper .
Fruity and sweet , this white is a great counterbalance to the deep and hoppy Red .
A great summer beer .
Blue :
For my final pick , I had to go with a local brew I ’m fairly proud of .
Wachusett Brewing Co. is a small Massachusetts brewery , and as a result their beers are n’t terribly easy to get outside of the Northeast .
If you ’ve never heard of it , well I ’m sorry .
Wachusett Blueberry is a great example of how to do a fruit beer right .
Like most other fruit beers , this one has a low hop high wheat character .
However , unlike almost all other fruit beers , the blueberry taste is both natural and subtle .
The blueberry tastes like real blueberry , and it does n’t overpower the ‘ beer ’ taste .
Drinking this beer does n’t feel like you ’re drinking fruit soda or processed syrup thrown into a batch of otherwise weak lager .
Wachusett Blueberry is far and away my favorite fruit flavored beer , and fast becoming one of the only fruit beers I can tolerate .
Next time you ’re in New England , do yourself a favor and pick up a six - pack .
Or if you happen to catch it on tap , order half a pint of this under half a pint of Guinness and taste the real ‘ Black and Blue ’ that you ’ve been missing all these years .
So there you have it .
Three unique , delicious , and All - American craft beers that should make any president proud .
If you disagree , I ’d love to hear your theme suggestions .
Leave your thoughts in the comments .
Girls are advised to take 12,000 steps a day and boys to take 15,000
Children taking part in a study to measure how much exercise they do fooled researchers by attaching their pedometers to their pet dogs .
About 200 children in east London were given pedometers to automatically count how many steps they walked and ran .
Mile End Centre for Sports and Exercise Medicine was surprised by the activity levels recorded in some obese children .
Professor Nicola Maffulli said : " Then we realised they were attaching the pedometers to their dogs ' collars . "
' Extremely active '
The pilot study in Whitechapel required 11 and 12 - year - olds to clip a pedometer to their waists , with researchers at the centre collecting the readings by satellite .
" But after a week we found there were some kids who were extremely active but still obese , " said Professor Maffulli .
It was " not unheard of " for participants in previous studies to manipulate the readings of pedometers , he added .
Once adjusted to take into account the help from pets , the study indicated that boys in the borough walk or run 12,620 steps a day , below the recommended level of 15,000 steps .
It also found that girls take 10,150 steps , falling short of the recommended 12,000 steps .
It indicated that more than a third of 11 and 12 - year - olds in the borough of Tower Hamlets are overweight or obese - 11 % higher than the national average .
Researchers plan to extend the study to include more children in the borough .
After the murder of his childhood friend in front of his eyes , the slick Detroit detective , Axel Foley , heads to sunny Beverly Hills , on a one - man mission to ferret out the killer and bring him to justice .
Before long , Axel and his unorthodox methods unearth the lucrative drug operation of the powerful local crime kingpin , Victor Maitland ; however , Foley , too , will find himself in deep trouble , as Lieutenant Andrew Bogomil wants him out of town .
Now , Axel will have to team up with Detectives , John Taggart , and Billy Rosewood , to shed light on the thick conspiracy , and finish what he has started .
Will Foley 's total disregard for proper procedure bear fruit ?

SETTING THE RECORD STRAIGHT ( publ .
6/17/2009 )
A story about American Airlines ’ plan to drop flights from San Jose to Austin incorrectly said the airline was not canceling other Bay Area flights .
American ’s affiliate , American Eagle , will halt all of its five daily flights between San Jose and San Diego and will eliminate two of its seven daily flights between San Jose and Orange County .
In addition , American Eagle will drop three of its five daily flights between San Francisco and Orange County .
All of the changes will occur Aug. 25 .
The “ nerd birds ” soon will fly no more .
That ’s the name given to the flights of mostly electrical engineers , computer programmers and other tech - savvy passengers that American Airlines has been shuttling daily between San Jose and Austin since 1992 .
Because the recession has cut sharply into business and other travel , American has announced it will discontinue its twice - a- day nonstop flights between the two tech centers as of Aug. 25 .
“ We ’re bummed , ” said Ed Nelson , director of air service development for Mineta San Jose International Airport , though he added he understands the airline ’s rationale for dropping the flights .
“ It ’s probably the toughest time in the history of the airline industry , ” he said .
“ The economy is quite soft , consumer confidence is weak and air travel is not something that is high on people ’s list . ”
Over the years , planes flying between several other regions — such as Boston and Raleigh - Durham , N.C. — also have been dubbed nerd birds because so many of their passengers work for tech companies .
However , the flights from San Jose to Austin were the first , according to American Airlines spokesman Tim Smith .
“ These were the original two , ” he said , noting that the dropped route is one of many systemwide reductions the carrier is being forced to make because of the economy .
American has no plans to drop any other Bay Area flights and might reinstate the nerd - bird flights if business picks up again , Smith said .
But he added , “ we ’re in no position to promise at this stage . ”
Once the flights are discontinued , passengers no longer will be able to fly from San Jose to Austin without a connecting flight from another city .
Southwest flies once a day to Austin from Oakland International Airport , and United and Jet Blue each operate one daily flight from San Francisco to Austin .
However , for many nerd - bird veterans , making the Texas trip from another airport is less convenient than going from San Jose , said David Miller , a spokesman for Santa Clara - based Applied Materials , which manufactures equipment for making semiconductors and has operations in the Austin area .
“ It makes it harder for our people to get to Austin , ” said Miller , who estimated he ’s flown the nerd - bird route 20 times over the years and noted that the planes were fun because they were full of tech engineers .
A similar concern was expressed by Drew Prairie , a nerd - bird frequent flier and spokesman for Sunnyvale - based Advanced Micro Devices , a chip - making company that also has major Austin - area operations .
“ Of course we are disappointed in American Airlines ’ decision to cancel the ‘ nerd bird , ’ and we hope that at some point they will reconsider the direct flights , ” said Prairie , adding that the flights ’ mix of tech competitors made for interesting trips .
He described those on board as “ mostly folks with laptops looking for plugs and trying to make sure they were being careful their screens were n’t visible , given the close proximity of other passengers . ”
In 2007 , San Jose ’s airport averaged about 177 daily departures .
But in 2008 , that dropped to 162 .
And this month , the number is down to about 149 .
It ’s a similar story at Oakland , where the average number of daily flights decreased from 225 in 2007 to 190 in 2008 and this month is about 148 .
No 2009 data on the number of daily flights from San Francisco was available Monday .
But that airport saw its average daily flight total rise from about 1,040 in 2007 to about 1,062 last year , due largely to Southwest , Virgin America and Jet Blue launching operations there , said SFO spokesman Mike McCarron .
Not seeing American ’s nerd birds roaring over Silicon Valley will be disconcerting , said Marc Casto , president of San Jose - based Casto Travel .
“ It ’s a popular route , ” he said .
“ It is troubling that this is another flight that ’s leaving San Jose airport . ”

How to use RDFa to make SELECT results locally available as RDF
A couple of weeks ago , I 've written about the self - enforcing value spiral that RDF data enables .
Here is an example about how RDFa can be used to support this " Repurpose - Republish " loop .
While data exchange between different semantic web sources is usually RDF - based ( i.e. the data always maintain their semantics ) , there is one major exception : SPARQL SELECT queries .
This developer - oriented operation returns tabular data ( similar to record sets in SQL ) .
Once the query result is separated from the query , the associated structural data is lost .
You can't directly feed SELECT results back into a triple store , even though querying based on linked resources means that you have just created knowledge .
It 's a pity to show this generated information to human consumers only .
One of the demos at my NYC talk was a dynamic wiki item that pulled in competitor information from Semantic CrunchBase and injected that into a page template as HTML .
The existing RDF infrastructure does not let me cache the SELECT results locally as usable RDF .
And a semantic web client or crawler that indexes the wiki page will not learn how the described resource ( e.g. Twitter ) is related to the remote , linked entities .
However , by simply adding a single RDFa hook to the wiki item template , the RDF relation ( e.g. competitor ) can be made available again to apps that process my site content .
This is basically how Linked Data works .
But here is the really nifty thing :
My site can be a consumer of its own pages , too , recursively enriching its own data .
I tweaked the wiki script which now works like this :
When the page is saved , a first operation updates the wiki markup in the page 's graph ( i.e. the not - yet - populated template ) .
In a second step , the page URL is retrieved via HTTP .
This will return HTML with RDFa - encoded remote data , which is then parsed by ARC , and finally added to the same graph .
We end up with a graph that does not only contain the wiki markup , but also the RDFized information that was integrated from remote sites .
After adding this graph to the RDF store , we can use a local query to generate the page and occasionally reset the graph to enable copy - by - reference .
And all this without any custom API code .
UPDATE : A Google employee blogs a review : “ A fantastic post about disrupting education . ”
Whew ! 🙂
Clayton Christensen is a Harvard Business School professor who originated the canonical Model of Disruptive Innovation .
He is also a co-author of the 2008 book Disrupting Class : How Disruptive Innovation Will Change the Way the World Learns , which makes a business case for an online market for customized education .
Excerpts :
“ In the last three decades , increasing numbers of cognitive psychologists and neuroscientists … have produced a multitude of schemes to explain … that people learn differently from one another …
Students need customized pathways and paces to learn …
In the first phase of the disruption of the instructional system the software will likely be complicated and expensive to build .
The reasons for this can be traced to the use of the existing commercial system when marketing the system …as well as to the relative immaturity of Web 2.0 software .
Within a few more years , however , two factors that were absent in stage 1 that are critical to the emergence of stage 2 will have fallen into place .
The first will be platforms that facilitate the creation of user - generated content .
The second will be the emergence of a user network , whose analogues in other industries would be eBay [ i.e. , an online market is a type of user network ] …
The data suggest that by 2019 , about 50 percent of high school courses will be delivered online … 80 percent of courses taken in 2024 will have been taught online . ”
American companies that own a popular online market for customized education can expect to increase profits dramatically by :
introducing a loan program for consumers of customized education making the popularity of the company ’s market and loan program mutually reinforcing , so a borrower who performs well as a student is rewarded with a lower interest rate taking advantage of new government regulations to become a bank , as a means of increasing the amount of money the company can lend introducing other loan programs and financial services that complement the market
Canonical research findings suggest that these companies will catalyze the creation of many good jobs .
One source of these findings is Paul Romer , a Stanford economist who originated New Growth Theory , which updates growth economics for the information age .
From Romer ’s article on economic growth in The Concise Encyclopedia of Economics :
“ Perhaps the most important ideas of all are …ideas about how to support the production and transmission of other ideas … North Americans invented the modern research university …
As national markets for talent and education merge into unified global markets , opportunities for important policy innovation will surely emerge …
There are …safe predictions .
First , the country that takes the lead in the twenty - first century will be the one that implements an innovation that more effectively supports the production of new ideas in the private sector . ”
Other canonical research findings suggest that the aforesaid companies will end the reign of the kleptobankers .
In their 2006 textbook on International Economics ( 7th ed. ) , Paul Krugman and Maurice Obstfeld define “ the problem of collective action ” :
“ While it is in the interests of the group as a whole to press for favorable policies , it is not in any individual ’s interest to do so . ”
Krugman and Obstfeld continue :
“ In a now famous book [ The Logic of Collective Action ] , economist Mancur Olson pointed out that …the problem of collective action can best be overcome when a group is small ( so that each individual reaps a significant share of the benefits of favorable policies ) and / or well - organized . ”
From a 2009 book co-authored by Clayton Christensen :
“ Regulations ultimately change in reaction to [ disruptive ] innovators ’ success in those markets . ”
Krugman and Obstfeld provide evidence that Christensen ’s innovators equate to Olson ’s small group .
Specifically , the co-authors summarize research which makes it plain that , in their words :
“ Politicians are , indeed , for sale . ”
Of course , successful entrepreneurs in a given industry are the small group who have the motive and means to buy changes to regulation that disadvantage the industry ’s old guard .
From elsewhere in the 2009 book co-authored by Christensen :
“ Those disruptors that successfully dismantled the regulations that stood in their way succeeded by circumventing the regulation — by innovating in a disruptive market that was beyond the regulators ’ reach or was peripheral to their vision . ”
For a banking entrepreneur , a peripheral market that is ideal to disrupt is one wherein :
the act of consuming makes customers ( more ) creditworthy a lot of money can be made directly ( i.e. , independent of banking )
Needless to say , creditworthiness correlates positively with educational attainment .
And if Christensen ’s projections about the growth of online education are not way off base , owning a popular online market for customized education will be very lucrative .
Q.E.D. 🙂
What remains to be done , then , is to expedite the advent of said market - makers .
I have developed a business plan for such a market - maker .
The plan has been praised by analysts at Microsoft , Amazon.com and top venture capital firm Draper Jurvetson .
The plan is presently circulating within The New York Times Company ( a media company is an ideal source of funding for the plan ) .
In particular , the plan makes the case that certain steps must be taken to popularize an online market for customized education .
A preview of the case :
The company will introduce an online market for advertisement spaces .
The company will provide a virtual currency for use at the market .
In combination , the market and the currency will provide people with new and improved ways to showcase and earn money from expertise ( e.g. , a way for professionals to network that is vastly superior to LinkedIn or Facebook ) .
The popularity of the ad - space market will create demand for new ways to showcase expertise .
To meet this demand , the company will introduce many online prediction markets .
The popularity of the ad - space market and the prediction markets will be mutually reinforcing .
The advent of these markets will motivate people to share , aggregate and analyze information — and to share or sell their aggregations and analyses .
Much of this activity will be undertaken to help consumers of customized education spend wisely .
In particular , said consumers will gain valuable insights from analyses of prices in the ad - space market , and of data from the prediction markets .
The popularity of the customized - education market and the other markets will be mutually reinforcing .

The team dug in small areas to gather more precisely dated samples
Examples of pottery found in a cave at Yuchanyan in China 's Hunan province may be the oldest known to science .
By determining the fraction of a type , or isotope , of carbon in bone fragments and charcoal , the specimens were found to be 17,500 to 18,300 years old .
The authors say that the ages are more precise than previous efforts because a series of more than 40 radiocarbon - dated samples support the estimate .
The work is reported in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
The Yuchanyan cave was the site where the oldest kernels of rice were found in 2005 , and it is viewed as an important link between cave - dwelling hunter - gatherer peoples and the farmers that arose later in the basin of the nearby Yangtze River .
Archaeologists before have n't looked at this closely enough to realise what 's going on in caves
David Cohen
Boston University
The previous oldest - known example of pottery was found in Japan , dated to an age between 16,000 and 17,000 years ago , but debate has raged in the archaeological community as to whether pottery was first made in China or Japan .
The most recent dig at Yuchanyan was in 2005 by a team led by Elisabetta Boaretto of the Kimmel Center for Archaeological Science at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel .
They believe they have found a more precise way to read the history of human activity written in layers of sediment , or stratigraphy .
' Layer cake '
" The way people move around and mess up caves is very difficult to see archaeologically , " David Cohen , an archaeologist at Boston University and a co-author on the research , told BBC News .
" Imagine you have a fire and then people come in again have another fire and another , so you have the ashes of all these fires building up but at the same time people are digging and clearing , pushing things to the side ; this messes things up .
Fragments from a 1995 dig at Yuchanyan form a cauldron " If you have an open - air site , you sometimes get a very clean ' layer cake ' stratigraphy .
Archaeologists before have n't looked at this closely enough to realise what 's going on in caves so they interpret this stratigraphy as a layer cake .
But in actuality , it 's ' lenses ' of stuff that 's been mixed up and moved around . "
It is comparatively easy to find evidence of human occupation in caves through the dating of charcoal from fires or bones from long - ago dinners , Dr Cohen said .
However , because of the unclear layering of sediment it is not easy to correlate well - dated layers with the pottery that may be nearby .
Part of the problem lies in the areas over which previous digs have searched : squares of perhaps five metres on a side .
" It 's an issue of association , knowing where everything comes from in space across the cave , " Dr Cohen explained .
" If you 're excavating in a huge unit , you can only say it comes from within this 5 m area and this 20cm of sediment , and that 's not good enough for understanding human activity . "
Instead , the team worked in sub-divisions of just a quarter of a metre square , painstakingly collecting bone and charcoal fragments .
The samples were then radiocarbon dated , revealing a clean distribution stretching between 14,000 and 21,000 years ago .
' Fantastic cave '
One fragment of pottery was found in a layer between two radiocarbon - dated fragments that both measured about 18,000 years old , taking the record for oldest pottery .
The team hope that their smaller - scale searching and taking into account the effects of human activity on cave stratigraphy will help with future digs at Yuchanyan , and elsewhere .
" It 's a fantastic cave , and we hope that the way these excavations were done would set a precedent for how other caves will be looked at , " said Dr Cohen .
Dr Tracey Lu , from an anthropologist at the Chinese University of Hong Kong , who was not an author on the latest study , noted that the dates reported in this paper were slightly older than dates on pottery found in Japan .
However , she said the accuracy of radiocarbon dates in the limestone area has been under debate for many years .
" I agree that pottery was made by foragers in South China , " she told the Associated Press news agency .
" But I also think pottery was produced more or less contemporaneously in several places in East Asia ... from Russia , Japan to North and South China by foragers living in different environments . "

Current High Scores
Unfortunately High Scores are no longer available :(
The AP reported Monday on the case of Stacey Anvarinia , the North Dakota woman who recently pleaded guilty to felony child neglect for breastfeeding under the influence .
She could face 5 years in prison when she is sentenced in August .
As you may remember , the story emerged last week , and initially there were numerous questions lingering .
Not to mention a lot of debate on whether alcohol consumption affects breastmilk and therefore the babies who drink it .
But now , a few more details have come out about this case , and it actually makes less sense .
Grand Forks Police Lt. Rahn Farder commented on it :
This case is more than just the breast - feeding .
It was the totality of the circumstances .
It is quite unusual for a mother to be breast - feeding her child as we are conducting an investigation , whether she was intoxicated or not .
Huh ?!
Not only does that puzzling quote leave me wanting to interrogate the police force , so do a few other points .
[ social_buttons ]
The police arrived at Anvarinia ’s home after receiving a domestic disturbance call .
Anvarinia said that her boyfriend assaulted her , and the police report said she had swelling on her nose and chin and a scratch on her cheek .
Indeed , in the above mug shot , she does look a bit messed up .
The boyfriend was not there at the time they arrived and has not been charged for the alleged assault .
Grand Forks authorities also decline to say who currently has custody of Anvarinia ’s 6 - week - old daughter .
The AP story also included a mention that the woman had a previous criminal record , but did not say what that involved .
Finally , there ’s this :
It ’s unclear how much Anavarina had to drink .
Police never conducted a blood - alcohol test .
Investigators believed she was drunk , and her arrest on a charge of child abuse and neglect did not require a test .
‘ The majority of our problems are caused by alcohol , ’ said Grand Forks Police Capt .
Kerwin Kjelstrom .
‘ Our officers handle it so much that it is pretty much a general knowledge thing to know when someone is intoxicated .
It ’s pretty obvious . ’
Oooh .
Now I get it .
A woman who gave birth 6 weeks earlier and then was allegedly assaulted ( in the head , no less ) and happened to have a criminal record was perceived to be drunk , so she probably was .
Therefore , it was obviously in the best interest of mother and breastfed child that they be separated .
Like I said … making less sense all the time .
There are ongoing arguments in the online community about this case .
And the more details that emerge , the more discussion there will be , it seems .
Though I do n’t agree with most of what the “ The Skeptical OB ” writes , I do agree with these words , from retired OB Dr. Amy Tuteur ,
Since when is breast - feeding while drunk a crime ?
If she had been bottle - feeding her baby , no one would have bothered to check what was in the bottle .
You can do a lot more damage by mixing formula wrong .

In the first 12 parts of this series we 've looked at the elaborate and fascinating literary structure of the creation story in the first two chapters of Genesis , and how it would read to you , if you were an ancient Israelite .
Now we 're ready to ask some questions about the meaning of the story .
So what would you , as an ancient Israelite , fully aware of all the parallelism and literary structure in this passage , have understood it to mean ?
Let 's begin with three things you would n't have thought it meant .
You would n't have thought that it was historical — that it was a description of an event in the past .
Ancient humans were not simple or unsophisticated .
They had , as we have just seen , elaborate intellectual and literary traditions , and they understood how literary conventions worked .
In this case we have a sort of double telling of the same themes , in which each half perfectly parallels the other .
Each half is an historical account on the surface .
But if the surface accounts are taken literally they contradict each other at almost every point .
One account takes six days ; the other , only one .
In one account humanity is created last ; in the other , first .
In one account the chaos before creation is described as a dark , formless sea ; in the other as a dry , uncultivated wilderness .
On the surface , they could n't be more different .
The ancient author , and the ancient audience , would have understood immediately that the six days , and the one day , were both literary devices , used for the purpose of structuring the story , and , in the case of the six days , carrying a part of the theme .
Precisely because the two tightly paralleled versions contradict each other historically , you would have known that the passage was not addressing history — you would have laughed indulgently at a child or simpleton who thought the passage was talking about a specific , single event in the past .
You would n't have thought the passage was an anti-evolution tract .
To begin with , of course , you would n't have even heard of evolution , so it would n't have come up .
But if you had — if , say , a time - traveler had shown up on your doorstep , explained the theory of evolution to you , and asked you to evaluate it on the basis of this passage , you would not have found anything in the passage to contradict it .
On the contrary , you would have found much in the passage to back the theory up .
In the second half , Yahweh gods " makes the trees spring from the ground " .
That is , while the ultimate causer is divine , it 's the trees that do the springing .
In the first half , gods commands the earth to produce the plants : again , the ultimate cause is a divine command , but the actual producing is done by the earth .
And immediately , in this context , the passage describes the nature of plant life as based on the production of seeds , and consequent reproduction " after their kind " .
Remember , these people were farmers .
They understood how to select the plants which produced the best crop and breed them .
They knew that " after their kind " did n't mean " without variation " .
They knew that , after a great many generations of selection by a breeder , a plant or animal could become fantastically different from the original stock .
And they did n't use the modern , scientific , concept of " species " , which plays such a large role in the older fundamentalist objections to the theory .
The theory of evolution depends upon just two things — that there is a certain amount of variation from one fig tree to the next ( something they would have known in their bones ) , and that fig trees reproduce " after their kind " , so that these variations can be handed down .
The rest is selection — something else they would have known all about .
If you had been one of them — not hogtied by a modern , scientific world - view and the consequent habit of reading ancient poetry as though it were a science text — you would have quite possibly greeted the idea of evolution with an enthusiastic recognition that it fit the passage perfectly .
" Ah !
That 's what it 's talking about ! "
The same is true of animal life .
The second passage tells us that Yahweh gods formed animals out of the earth , and the first tells us that gods did this by commanding the earth to bring them forth — gods does the commanding , but the earth does the bringing forth .
And once again the passage immediately mentions the means of reproduction ( and of evolution ) — " each according to its kind " , in parallel to the the plants .
And , beyond that , you will remember that the first passage created a certain puzzle in your mind .
Quite suddenly , at the creation of humans , gods said let us create humans in our image .
But the word " gods " had been previously used as a singular straight through the passage — in spite of its plural form .
On the parallel day , day three , gods told the earth to bring forth plant life , involving the earth in the process of creation , and the element on day six that is parallel to the earth is the land animals .
So the perfectly obvious reading of this passage is that gods is inviting the animal kingdom to participate with gods , in creating humans in their joint image .
And the passage is explicitly aware of how life creates life — by reproducing after its kind .
And , in fact , it is quite obvious that we are formed in the image of animals — with skin , bones , lungs , hearts , brains .
This interpretation , by the way , would fit perfectly in the world - view of the passage , even without any reference to evolution .
The theory of evolution would simply be a further elaboration of the ideas already here .
If the passage has anything at all to say about evolution , it must be taken to endorse the idea — or , at the very least , present a world - view that is completely compatible with it .
Modern fundamentalists who object to the theory are not interpreting this passage on its own terms .
Any conservative Christian has , in this passage , a Biblical foundation for the concept of evolution .
You would n't have thought there was anything wrong with thinking of humans as primates .
I bring this up because I often think that the anti-evolution sentiment has more to do with " do n't call me a monkey " than it has to do with " that 's not what the Bible says " .
This passage does n't call anyone a monkey , and it does say that there 's something special about humans ( which we 'll get to in the next part ) , but it definitely classes humans with other animal life .
It does that in two ways .
In the second half , Yahweh forms both humans and animals out of the ground , giving them a common origin .
In the first half , it divides kinds of life into categories , assigned to different days , and based on how they move around .
Plants , which do n't move , are assigned to day three .
Birds , which fly , and fish , which swim , are assigned to day five .
Land animals ( including humans ) who walk or crawl on the land , are assigned to day six .
These are the basic categories of life , according to the first chapter , and humans are seen , along with apes , as belonging to the category of land animals .
Beyond that , the reason has to do with the way they walk .
So if we are related to all land animals by the fact that we walk , we must be even more closely related to those who can walk on two legs , like us .
As an ancient Israelite , you would have found this obvious , based on the the themes and structures of the passage .
But of course , these are questions that an ancient reader would n't have asked .
In the next part we 'll talk about what they would have asked .
THE HORROR , Bond traders are white with terror
Gold Battle
Thrilla in Manila !
I want to talk about the bond market today as it relates to gold .
And take you into the very real mind of a very real bond trader .
Looking at a bond and gold chart is all very interesting if you like watching ivory tower movies .
I do .
But movies are not the whole picture .
Experiencing the market thru the eyes of a real professional bond trader gives you a sensation of reality , in this case a most horrifying reality , that no chart can give you .
I 'm going to take you into the mind of a major bond trader who is a very good friend of mine .
What 's happening in bond land ?
The latest US govt bond auction was for $ 110 billion .
Two years ago the average monthly bond auction total was $ 5 billion , $ 10 billion , numbers like that .
The US govt finances its debt with bonds .
A $ 2 trillion deficit means $ 2 trillion in new bonds needs to be issued .
Approx .
$ 200 billion a month .
I want to take you inside the mind of a primary dealer .
These are the approx .
20 dealers that have contracts with the US govt to market their bonds .
The way the deal works in the govt 's mind is : " You buy our bonds and sell them .
You can short t- bonds going into the auction and bag a nice profit for yourself .
But if you do n't sell the bonds to your clients , guess who owns them ?
You do !
If you do n't like it , no more primary dealing for you , got it ?
And maybe we are n't so keen to hand over anymore bailout money or allow fraud accounting of your OTC derivatives .
So play ball , or we take you out . "
I spent two hours yesterday meeting in person with a very good friend of mine who is retired as the largest govt bond trader in Canada for one of the primary dealers .
He still manages $ 1.5 billion as a side gig .
His minimum trade is $ 5 million .
He looks like a pitbull and uses 4 letter words like Mr. Bernanke uses a greenback photocopier .
He carefully detailed to me the horrors that began roaring thru the bond market , horrors that are growing , since the shocking $ 110 billion US govt bond auction was announced for this week .
The bottom line is :
There is n't enough money to soak up all the govt paper screaming down the pipe .
The $ 300 billion in total that Mr. Bernanke committed to buy the bonds over multiple auctions , is a drop in the bucket .
It 's not enough .
There is a daily competition for money in the world 's bond markets .
The US govt bond is the King Daddy of those markets .
The primary dealers will do WHATEVER IT TAKES to sell those bonds .
The primary dealers also carry tremendous power against the govt .
Let 's have a listen to their response to the Gman 's " it 's my way or the highway " .
Listen carefully .
" How would you like it , Mr. Gman , if we announced that " sorry , we can't find buyers for your triple A rated toilet paper , we 're going to announce to your public that you defaulted .
Let 's see how you do when we cut your credit cards up .
You tell us what to do ?
Wrong .
Go ahead , take away our primary dealerships .
We 're all standing together on this .
We give the orders , not you .
Got it ? "
What might those orders be ?
One order could be : " Your $ 300 billion commitment to buy T - bonds ai n't gonna cut it .
Try $ 3 trillion .
Now get to your greenback photocopier start button and start pushing it .
We 'll tell you when to stop . "
While that action may be in the pipeline , as of today the ACTIONS taken in the bond market by the players are what is important .
And those actions , believe it or not , are to buy bonds .
Money is starting to come out of general equities , aka the stock market , and into bonds .
Money is not coming out of bonds , it 's going in .
This is what the chartists do n't understand .
Money is n't just trickling in , it 's pouring in .
But it 's not enough to meet the govt 's skyrocketing demand for money !
The losses in the bond market have pounded bank capital ratios .
Balanced funds must now sell stocks and buy bonds to meet their mandated percentages .
Losses on corporate bonds bought over the past year are staggering .
Many hedge funds leveraged their purchases and are now in dire trouble .
I have warned you all repeatedly about taking delivery of a portion of your stock certificates .
Securing your gold .
Holding 1 to 12 months expenses cash outside the banking system .
The bond market auction was this week .
Again , I want you to FEEL what the bond traders are feeling .
They are white with terror .
They are n't looking at some chart in internet candyland , they know there is n't enough money to buy all the govt bonds .
Where we appear to be headed is for a test of the Dow lows .
You had better pray those lows hold .
Because if they do n't , your money could become a target of the govt as its demand for money skyrockets , while the supply of money tanks .
The ideal situation is a fast crash towards those lows with perhaps either the Dow transports or the industrials breaking , but not both .
While that happens , the bond market must rally .
The nightmare situation is the Dow just slowly rolls down , and bonds mount no major rally .
If both the Dow transports and the industrials break the lows , the global banking and brokerage system will likely be closed soon after that , the first of many such closes .
Short selling would likely be banned .
A national sales tax would be simply one of a zillion money grabs .
I do things in moderation .
If the Dow industrials and transports break the lows , I would seriously consider moving 5 % of your IRA and 401k money out and into physical gold on the next correction in gold .
Looking back , you should have bought gold bullion in a pyramid formation instead of opening IRA and 401k accounts .
It 's too late to turn that clock back .
It 's a small number , but you may not need that much insurance than 5 % given the magnitude of the dangers at hand .
Nothing is fixed .
Nothing is repaired .
If Ben Bernanke fails to drastically increase the Fed 's purchases of bonds , another vortex of asset destruction is a near certainty , as the primary dealers will exert mindblowing pressure on the managers of other assets to move those assets into bonds .
Some of the movement is being triggered automatically thru asset allocation algorithms .
Let me repeat : money IS not just moving into bonds now , it is POURING in .
But ... that money is not enough to soak up all the bonds the govt is issuing .
Most money managers are only just this week starting to understand this reality .
And what kind of horrific situation this is .
If Mr. Bernanke steps forward and announces massive new bond purchases , that could disintegrate the USdollar and send gold to $ 1200 in weeks or even days .
On the other hand , if he does n't , the primary dealers have no choice but to order a massive liquidation of equity and commodity assets to feed the Gman 's maniacal demand for money .
Picture a black hole .
Everything is being sucked into it .
That is the US govt 's demand for money .
This week 's announcement of the $ 110 billion auction is literally seen by the bond traders as announcing that a real black hole has opened up on a sandy beach .
EVERYTHING is slowly being sucked in .
Even the sand .
And it is accelerating fast in a massive deflationary vortex .
As the govt gets the money , it is BURNED .
As the sand ( and people ) pour down the hole , even gold could get sucked in as everything is sold to feed the Gman .
Here 's the gold chart , the weekly .
The chart looks phenomenal .
Indicators almost all right in the middle " sweet spot . "
Perfect to activate the head and shoulders .
Sadly , the massive increases in the commercial short positions of gold and other commodities over the past few weeks suggest it could be the deflationary vortex that emerges the victor of this clash of the titans .
Will gold soar or melt ?
I would n't bet 10 cents on one scenario exclusively over the other .
I want my subscribers to be 100 % prepared for any and all scenarios .
Remember the tools Mr. Bernanke has laid out .
After the purchase of the t- bonds fails , ( and it is badly failing right now ) the next step is gold revaluation .
If you think the United States govt is going to stand around like a wet noodle while their t- bonds are liquidated and watch all " their " money pour into gold without taking action to prevent that , please report to your new home on Fantasy Island .
And do n't expect there to be any gold there for you when you arrive .
Own gold stocks bought into weakness and take delivery of a portion of your certificates .
Own gold jewellery .
Secure your gold before the govt secures it for you .
Jim " Mr. Big " Sinclair , the world 's largest trader of gold in the last bull market , feels gold could begin a skyrocket move to 1200 , within 3 weeks !
Jim " Mighty Man " Rogers feels gold could fall to 700 !
The bottom line right now is the bond market will decide the victor .
The good news is Mighty Man will be a buyer at 700 if it happens .
If he is correct , another massive wave of asset destruction is just around the corner , one that could require in excess of $ 50 trillion in money printing to cover the announced otc derivatives losses that will probably follow .
The IMF may have no choice but to start a massive liquidation of its gold very quickly if the bond market does n't reverse .
They have no money and they may be enlisted to buy US govt debt .
This is the clash of the titans and the public , who has just loaded up on stocks in time to be killed , is on the verge of being totally obliterated .
Regardless of which way this plays out .
Ironically , as money pours out of other assets to buy US govt bonds to feed US Gman Friar Tuck , it could have the effect of a giant short position on the USD being unwound , triggering a massive USD rally .
The scenarios for huge price movements in all the major markets in all kinds of directions is arguably stronger right now than ever in financial history !
This is the ultimate nail biter , the Financial Thrilla in Manila !
Will it be Jim Sinclair 's bull rocket , or Jim Rogers ' sledgehammer ?
I 'd like to leave you with an even bigger question for the weekend , and that is :
Are You Prepared ?

This is an excellent piece written by Stewart Thomson of Graceland Updates ( ht Ryan ) .
My warning is that his site focuses heavily on precious metals , but what I like about this article is his focus on CAPITAL FLOWS ( bond market versus stock market ) , and his neutrality in who will win the battle of evermore or what he calls the " thrilla in Manila !
"
As you read the following article , please keep in mind the fact that next week ’s bond auction will auction a staggering $ 127 billion in debt ( $ 6.6 TRILLION annualized ! ) !
For a quick review of the bond market ’s latest action , I recommend that you review my article , Interest Rate Update …
While I believe that the deflationary forces are going to win in the medium term , the other forces may ultimately win the battle in the long term .
You or I will not be “ winners ” regardless of who wins this battle !
You may think you can place a directional bet and become a winner , but I am not so certain – again , a reason I like this article :

How does your organisation measure up to its peers within the UK Charity sector ?
Having spent 113 years and 14 days on this earth , Henry Allingham is used to breaking records .
He is one of three British men still alive who actively served in the First World War , is the last surviving founder of the Royal Air Force , has long held the record for being the oldest man in Europe and earlier this year he became Britain 's most ancient man ever after overtaking John Evans , a Welsh former coal miner who died in 1990 aged 112 years and 295 days .
But when Mr Allingham woke up yesterday morning at St Dunstan 's care home for blind ex-service personnel , in Ovingdean , near Brighton , the supercentenarian was informed that he had suddenly achieved the highest age - related accolade for men .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Tomoji Tanabe , a Japanese retired civil engineer , had died peacefully in his sleep overnight .
He was 113 years ' and 274 days ' old and had more than 50 great - grandchildren .
Having foregone alcohol and cigarettes all his life , Tanabe had became the world 's oldest man in January 2007 .
That mantle has now passed to Mr Allingham – the first time a British person has ever held such a title .
A St Dunstan 's spokesman said that the oldest man on Earth greeted the news by simply returning to bed after breakfast for a celebratory nap .
For someone who has seen three different centuries , six monarchs , two world wars ( and 18 world cups ) , becoming the oldest living man is , perhaps , something of a non-event .
Mr Allingham is quieter these days , but no codger at heart .
In contrast to Mr Tanabe 's asceticism , he attributes his longevity to " cigarettes , whisky and wild , wild women " .
The Air Mechanic First Class is best known publicly for his war record , because of the many public engagements he has attended – up to 70 some years – including regular meetings with the Queen , politicians and soldiers returning from theatres of war in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Yet he dislikes talking about conflict , saying only : " War 's stupid .
Nobody wins . "
He added in an interview recently : " Like so many , I have tried to forget my time in the war .
In the last few years I have met other veterans , and we never spoke one word of the war , not one . "
One of the many remarkable things about him – particularly given the mores of his time – has been his willingness to talk about mental health .
" I 've had two major breakdowns , " he recalled , " one during the war and one after .
But both when I was trying to do the work of three men .
" The trick is to look after yourself and always know your limitations . "
On the key to a long and prosperous existence , he added : " I do n't know if there is a secret , but keeping within your capacity is vital . "
Allingham was born on 6 June 1896 in Clacton , east London , and his father died when he was a baby .
One - hundred - and - thirteen years later his dynasty includes six grandchildren , 12 great - grandchildren , 14 great - great - grandchildren and one great - great - great - grandchild .
In the meantime , he has personally experienced the events now known about predominantly through history textbooks .
At the time of his birth , the Football League had only two divisions and 23 teams , including long - since - departed mainstays such as Bootle FC and Northwich Victoria .
Just two months earlier , the first ever modern Olympics had taken place in Greece , with 15 international teams , among them that of the Austro - Hungarian Empire .
Mr Allingham 's earliest memories include cheering WG Grace at the Oval in 1903 and watching soldiers returning from the Boer War – an occasion which eventually inspired him to join the military himself .
In 1915 , shortly after his mother 's death , he joined the Royal Navy Air Service , initially to help maintain sea planes .
But high casualty rates – and Mr Allingham 's enthusiasm for taking to the air – meant that he soon joined in with air missions , serving as a spotter with Britain 's fleet of flimsy biplanes .
A year later he narrowly escaped death at the Battle of Jutland ; a German shell hurtling towards his merchant ship , the Kingfisher , ricocheted on the water and whistled clear over the ship 's deck .
He went on to fight at Ypres – where standing in two - feet of water in the trenches particularly haunted him – the Somme and Passchendaele .
Yet another of the exciting episodes in Mr Allingham 's life began in 1919 when he left the air force and went into the burgeoning motorcar industry , joining the design department at Ford cars in Dagenham .
The engineering skills he learnt there were put to use during the Second World as a designer of countermeasures to the German navy 's magnetic mines .
The 113 - year - old spent over half a century married to his first and only wife , Dorothy , with whom he tied the knot in 1919 , shortly after returning from the First World War .
Together they had two daughters , Jean and Betty , who emigrated to the US and both died in the 1980s .
Dennis Goodwin , the founder of the First World War Veterans ' Association and a long - time friend of Mr Allingham , said he was not surprised by his pal 's relaxed response to yesterday 's news .
" He is philosophical , he will take it in his stride like he does everything else , " Mr Goodwin said .
" I think he has done so well to now because the more you engage people and focus attention on them , the more they develop a will to live .
" And that 's the case with Henry .
If he had been allowed to vegetate he would have disintegrated . "
For his family , the news is yet another reason to be proud of an extraordinary man .
" It 's fantastic news , " said Mr Allingham 's nephew Ronald Cator , 74 , who is one of just a handful of relatives who does not live in the US , where Mr Allingham 's two daughters emigrated many decades ago .
" He is very frail now , but I 'm sure he 'll be pleased to hear it .
We are very proud of him . "

VITTEL , France 
The Dutch cyclist Kenny Van Hummel could feel the large white van , known as the broom wagon , looming close behind as he rode the final stage of the Pyrenees in the Tour de France .
The van , a vehicle of mercy , sweeps the back of the peloton , looking to pick up riders who want to quit the Tour midrace because they have suffered enough .
It is big enough to carry about 12 people .
But Van Hummel , a 26 - year - old sprinter on the Skil - Shimano team , would not have any of that .
He was last in the standings Sunday , but he refused to give up .
Though his back ached and his legs felt as if they were aflame , Van Hummel pedaled faster , making it to the top just inside the time cut , which is a percentage of the winning time that changes from stage to stage .

According to the message , the website , hosted on a server based in Holland , was closed immediately after the arrests , but it was functioning on Monday .
Commenting on the news , Kommersant business daily said that , in court , the owners of Interfilm were likely to be found guilty of violating the copyright legislation and sentenced to up to six years in prison .

MOSCOW — Natalia Estemirova was an increasingly rare breed in Russia .
Committed to exposing human rights abuses committed by the ruthless leadership in Chechnya , she lived and worked tirelessly in the republic ’s capital .
Today she was found dead .
Four men abducted Estemirova , the leading Russian human rights worker in the troubled Caucasus region , as she left her home in Grozny at about 8.30 a.m. Wednesday , July 15 .
Members of her organization , Memorial , started a public outcry .
In the midst of it , her body was found with two gun shots to the head , execution style .
Her lifeless body was dumped in Ingushetia , a neighboring republic .
Could this be the tipping point ?
In previous such murders — and there have been many — the finger - pointing has been somewhat wobbly .
The regime of Ramzan Kadyrov , the 32 - year - old leader who runs Chechnya as his own personal fiefdom , has managed to shrug off accusations that it is somehow involved in the spate of killings that have seen Kadyrov ’s opponents fall dead one by one , in Chechnya , in Moscow , and abroad .
Some have remained silent , likely fearing revenge .
For Memorial , there is nothing more to fear .
Oleg Orlov , the chairman of Memorial , Russia ’s preeminent human rights group , said Kadyrov has blood on his hands , and he plans on telling the world .
“ Ramzan Kadyrov is personally responsible , not only because he leads Chechnya , ” Orlov said , reacting more with raging anger than sadness over the death of his colleague .
“ He personally threatened Natalia , told her that her hands would be covered in blood and that he destroys bad people . ”
That threat came , he said , when Kadyrov dismissed Estemirova as head of the Grozny Human Rights Public Council early last year .
“ We did n’t say this before because we were scared for her safety .
Now we can say it .
We have no doubt that her killing was ordered by Ramzan Kadyrov . ”
Kadyrov has not responded to accusations that he was involved .
Maybe he ’ll come up with a defense like the one he gave when denying involvement in the October 2006 murder of journalist Anna Politkovskaya , with whom Estemirova often worked : “ I do not kill women and have never killed women . ”
Kadyrov has been accused of involvement in many high - profile killings .
Politkovskaya ’s murder was followed by the 2008 attack on Ruslan Yamadayev , a member of a powerful Chechen clan opposed to Kadyrov .
He was shot dead in front of the British Embassy in central Moscow during rush hour .
His brother was killed in March this year , slain by a gunman as he walked to his car in a posh Dubai apartment complex .
In perhaps the most brazen killing , Umar Israilov , a former Kadyrov bodyguard who won political asylum in Austria after publicly accusing Kadyrov of human rights abuses , was killed by a carload of assassins in central Vienna in January after a midday run to a grocery shop .
But these are not the killings Estemirova worked to expose .
She devoted her life to the everyday revenge killings and reprisal attacks that her research showed were carried out by the Kadyrov regime against average residents of Chechnya .
Tatiana Lokshina , of the Moscow office of Human Rights Watch , returned Tuesday evening from a research trip to Chechnya , where she worked closely with Estemirova .
“ We were working on absolutely outrageous cases — punitive houseburnings , abductions .
We documented a striking case of a public execution carried out by the authorities , ” she said .
“ These are immensely sensitive cases .
Hardly anybody touches them . ”
The public execution case could be what did it , according to Alexander Cherkasov , a colleague of Estemirova ’s at Memorial .
He too lay the blame with Kadyrov .
“ It ’s Chechen officials , the Chechen leadership .
Who else ? ”
The attacks on average Chechens tend to target families of suspected separatist insurgents , as violent anti-Kadyrov and anti-Moscow sentiment once again rises , according to Lokshina .
Moscow fought two bloody wars with Chechnya , from 1994 to 1996 and again starting in 1999 .
The mainly Muslim republic sought to secede from Russia in the wake of the Soviet Union ’s fall , and the Kremlin fought hard to prevent what it saw as a potential domino effect of secession across its empire .
Its tactics were brutal :
The capital was bombed , tens of thousands of civilians and soldiers perished , disappearances and mass killings flourished .
Chechen rebels responded with suicide bombings and mass hostage takings that reached all the way to Moscow .
Alongside its violent military campaign , the Kremlin sought to impose a political solution as well , installing a former rebel and chief mufti , Akhmad Kadyrov , as president .
When he was assassinated in a bomb attack in May 2004 , Vladimir Putin , then president , personally installed Kadyrov ’s thuggish son as the republic ’s next ruler .
Since then , Ramzan Kadyrov has ruled with a blank check , amassing untold wealth — in the form , partly , of fancy cars and an exotic zoo — and power in exchange for keeping the republic calm .
Now it looks like he is not keeping up his part of the deal .
“ During the past month , the level of human rights abuses has been staggering , ” Lokshina said .
“ It seems that the law enforcement and security agencies under the control of President Kadyrov are attempting to suppress an insurgency which is suddenly on the rise . ”
That is happening in part , she says , because of the human rights abuses continually perpetrated by the regime .
With the murder of Estemirova , there is one less voice to expose those abuses .
In October 2007 , Estemirova was awarded the inaugural prize to honor the life of Politkovskaya , awarded by RAW in WAR ( Reach All Women In War ) .
Accepting the award , she said : “ Our task … is to uncover their deeds and to fight them .
Anna was at the forefront of this work for many years .
She is no more .
Now it is up to us to continue her work . ”
With each killing , that becomes less and less likely .
And that , according to Memorial ’s Orlov , is part of the plan .
“ [ Kadyrov ’s regime ] is doing this so Chechnya will be closed , ” he said .
“ We were the only people who continue to say something .
Everyone else is scared .
We were the only ones , but apparently it was idiotic , because it ended in death . ”
The question , as always , remains what is to be done ?
Orlov called on Putin and President Dmitry Medvedev to remove Kadyrov as leader .
Judging by his brutal tactics , and his view of revenge as bloodsport , that may not be enough .
It is high time the Kremlin deal with a monster of its own making .
The question is : How ?

Charles Taylor , the former President of Liberia , who is on trial in The Hague for war crimes , took the stand yesterday and dismissed the testimony of ninety - one witnesses , brushing off charges of rape , torture , and murder as “ lies . ”
Taylor became Liberia ’s President in 1997 , after a bloody seven - year civil war .
In 2003 , the U.N. issued a warrant for his arrest ; he was accused of , among other things , conscripting children as soldiers and funnelling weapons to rebels in Sierra Leone in exchange for diamonds .
Jon Lee Anderson , who lived in Liberia as teen - ager , visited the country in 1998 , at the beginning of Taylor ’s Presidency , when the new leader still had wide international support .
Anderson put Taylor ’s rise in context :
During the multi-sided civil war …sadistic teen - age killers sporting names like General Fuck Me Quick , Babykiller , and Dead Body Bones arbitrarily executed civilians and decorated checkpoints on the roads with human heads and entrails .
Often on drugs , wearing fetishes they believed made them impervious to bullets , and garbed in costumes ranging from novelty - store fright masks to wigs and women ’s bathrobes , these murderous adolescents raped , pillaged , and slaughtered at will .
Many engaged in cannibalism , eating the hearts and genitals of their slain enemies in order to enhance their “ power . ”
Charles Taylor ’s fighters perpetrated some of the worst atrocities of the war , and it is a commonplace that Taylor was elected President last year not because he was popular but because people thought that if he did n’t win he would continue the violence .
Nevertheless , he is now a spokesman for peace , and to celebrate the first anniversary of his Presidency he is hosting a three - week “ national conference on Liberia ’s future , ” beginning this week .
He invited his domestic political opponents , several African heads of state , hundreds of prominent Liberians living abroad , and , of course , Americans like Ramsey Clark and Jesse Jackson .
In 2006 , when Anderson went back to Liberia , Taylor was living in exile in Nigeria , about to be released into the hands of the U.N. Anderson ’s article in the March 27 , 2006 , issue , “ After the Warlords , ” captured a country still grappling with a traumatic history .
( The article is available online to subscribers ; Anderson also spoke to Amy Davidson about his reporting . )
In a recent post on The New Yorker 's Book Club blog , Anderson described the contrast between Taylor ’s personal charm and his political actions :
When we met , he was President of the country , and he was very solicitous toward me , perfectly charming .
He even employed some of Liberia ’s wonderful old - fashioned niceties , calling me “ my dear , ” for instance .
At that moment in time , Taylor was probably responsible for the murders of several tens of thousands of his own countrymen , almost all of them civilians , many of them women and children .
And he was , by all accounts , aiding and abetting — in exchange for diamonds —
Sierra Leone ’s R.U.F. guerrillas , who were just beginning their limb - chopping frenzies through their own country .
Taylor is a prime example of someone who , to my eye , is nice but not “ good . ”

Whitney Houston ’s comeback album release
Whitney Houston ‘s record label announced the long awaited comeback album to be released on September 1 this year .
There has been no official announcement about the album title .
This will be Houston ’s seventh studio album and also her first to be released after seven years .
Her last album of original material was “ Just Whitney ” in 2002 .
“ You wait for the great songs to be written , ” record industry icon Clive Davis told MTV News during rehearsals for his pre-Grammy gala .
” The great hits Whitney has given to the public for so many years — you keep encouraging and setting the bar .
R. Kelly and Whitney just went into the studio with a great song called ‘ I Look to You . ’ ”
The 45 - year old diva was declared by Guiness Book of World Records last 2006 as “ the most awarded female artist of all time ” for having a total of 411 awards , which includes six Grammys and two Emmys .
Forest Park is one of the largest patches of urban wilderness in the United States , and the Victorian homes and gardens nearby create an air of Tolkienesque enchantment .
Right around here in fact , one of Tolkien ’s heirs labors in a century - old house .
“ I agree with Tolstoy that the best way to tell a story is invisibly , ” Ursula K. Le Guin says .
“ But I also hear what I write , and I think if you ca n’t read it out loud , there ’s something wrong with it . ”
It ’s hard to find a literary career as varied as Le Guin’s .
At 79 , she ’s worked for half a century on the ever - shifting frontier between literary and genre writing , a line she has helped redraw with her elegant prose .
Le Guin has long been celebrated as a pioneer of young adult literature .
Just two weeks ago she won a sixth Nebula Award for her YA novel “ Powers . ”
With last year ’s death of Arthur C. Clarke , she is also arguably the most acclaimed science fiction writer on the planet .
But she ’s more .
Her 1968 novel , “ A Wizard of Earthsea , ” concerned a school for wizards ; the National Endowment for the Arts made the book a selection of its program the Big Read .
“ I think Le Guin is vastly underrated by the critical establishment , which continues to stereotype her as a genre writer , ” says former NEA Chairman Dana Gioia .
“ She ’s become a deeply serious writer without losing the vitality and the excitement of popular literature . ”
Her admirers include Salman Rushdie as well as the generation working genre ’s borderlands : Michael Chabon , Neil Gaiman , David Mitchell , Jonathan Lethem and Kelly Link .
For all this , she is in a curious position :
She ’s achieved these things almost entirely on the basis of work now three and four decades old .
“ She was the big thing for almost 20 years , ” said Donna White , author of “ Dancing With Dragons : Ursula Le Guin and the Critics . ”
“ The 1970s and 1980s were her big decades ; she was revered by scholars .
But now people have moved on . ”
Her status is further confused because of the variety of fields -- YA , fantasy , science fiction , essays -- in which she writes .
But do n’t count Le Guin out .
Her recent “ Lavinia , ” a novel set in the world of Virgil ’s “ Aeneid , ” was compared by Publishers Weekly to Robert Graves ’ “ I , Claudius . ”
Le Guin ’s early years help explain her abiding concern :
Is there such a thing as a stable human nature ?
She grew up in Berkeley , the daughter of Alfred Kroeber , a founder of modern anthropology , and Theodora Kroeber , author of “ Ishi in Two Worlds , ” about an American Indian who had outlived his tribe .
Her childhood , which included summers at a family ranch in Napa , was full of reading , storytelling and visits from European intellectuals and Native Americans .
“ I was privileged , ” she says , “ to know the kind of people that most American kids , most bourgeois white kids , do n’t . ”
She was raised “ as irreligious as a jack rabbit . ”
Eric Rabkin , who teaches at the University of Michigan , sees her work as profoundly shaped by her exposure to alien cultures as well as her father ’s ambition to find as specifically as he could the time and place from which Western civilization had sprung .
“ There ’s a kind of romance to that view , ” Rabkin says .
“ That once upon a time , the worst antagonisms were merely inter-familial -- that basically we ’re all alike and trustworthy .
And I believe she grew up in a family in which that was considered not a fantasy but a scientific fact . ”
As a kid , Le Guin thought science fiction was corny .
“ When I was about 11 , ” she recalls , “ my brother and I used to buy Astounding [ and other pulps ] .
We sneered at a lot of it .
We were pretty arrogant kids . ”
Then , around age 30 , a friend drew her attention to Cordwainer Smith and Theodore Sturgeon .
“ I thought , ‘ Oh , look at that .
That could be fun . ’ ”
Some of the SF faithful hold it against Le Guin that she prefers Borges and Virginia Woolf to what she calls the “ white man conquers the universe ” tradition of Robert A. Heinlein .
Yet science fiction clearly fit this daughter of anthropologists .
Here , she wrote , “ All alternatives are thinkable .
It ’s not a comfortable , reassuring place .
It ’s a very large house , a drafty house .
But it ’s the house we live in . ”
From the late 1960s to the early 1970s , Le Guin went on a streak inspired by her interest in thought experiments and a Taoist concern for equilibrium .
The ferment of the Vietnam War and Watergate , of feminism and civil rights , stimulated her imagination :
She took these concerns and transmuted them , setting them on other planets and in other centuries .
This was an artist working at the peak of her powers .
All her books of this period have powerful images that suggest her importance to the environmental movement : a forest world , a harsh desert moon , flooded cities , island planets .
Her breakthrough novel was “ A Wizard of Earthsea , ” the coming - of - age tale of a young sorcerer who possesses great power but has also , through reckless pride , done damage to the world .
After it came two undisputed SF masterpieces : “ The Left Hand of Darkness ” and “ The Dispossessed . ”
Le Guin started writing the former as a book about a planet caught in an ice age .
It evolved into the tale of a race with no fixed gender : Every month , people go through a process in which they take on masculine or feminine characteristics .
This world is fully imagined , its texture coming from myths and folk tales wrapped around the narrative .
“ I ’m following Tolkien ’s prescription for fantasy creation , ” Le Guin says , sitting in her living room .
“ You are making a world out of words , and the only thing that ’s going to hold it together is its inner consistency . ”
“ The Dispossessed ” was equally celebrated ; it ’s a lively novel of ideas about a planet resembling the Cold War Earth and its anarchist moon and the troubled , soulful man who tries to restore their connection .
When it won the Hugo Award ( given by the fans ) and the Nebula ( given by the writers ) , Le Guin became the first author to win the doubleheader for two novels .
In 1973 , Le Guin wrote that science fiction had too little real criticism , that “ the writer is almost his only critic . ”
Soon criticism came thick and fast , not only from fandom and newspapers but also from an academia discovering SF .
Le Guin joined the dialogue , firing back in some cases .
Critics approached her work from so many directions -- Jungian , Taoist , environmental , feminist -- that they often talked past each other .
During the last 20 years , however , all that has changed .
Even many of those who admire Le Guin describe a falling off .
For guardians of SF tradition , her most devastating move may have been co-editing “ The Norton Book of Science Fiction , ” a 1993 anthology that George Slusser -- who once wrote an admiring study of her and has taught for 30 years at UC Riverside -- called “ an act of condescension . ”
With 26 of 67 stories by women , he says , the book lacks respect for SF ’s roots and established figures and “ does not reflect the field . ”
In his study “ The Dreams Our Stuff Is Made Of , ” Thomas M. Disch , a novelist of SF ’s New Wave who died last year , dismissed the book as “ a one - volume affirmative action campaign ” for gender balance , resenting its “ equation of male sexuality with aggression and physical violence . ”
And yet , Le Guin ’s later efforts do have their champions .
Writer and critic Carter Scholz describes “ Always Coming Home , ” a 1985 novel about a post - apocalyptic California dominated by hunter - gatherer tribes , as “ her most ambitious , experimental work . ”
“ Lavinia , ” meanwhile -- which Kirkus Reviews called “ arguably her best novel ” -- makes clear that Le Guin can still write in her classic style .
“ It is n’t like anything else I ’ve done , ” she says .
“ But the dignified style is the way I used to write , in the first Earthsea books .
Some of the cadences are storytelling rather than story writing . ”
Le Guin relearned Latin to read “ The Aeneid ” and research its era .
But because so little is known about daily life in the days when Rome was a dusty village , she was able largely to create that world .
Le Guin knows her work is n’t reaching audiences as it once did .
But if there ’s less breaking ground in her recent writing , she ’s not striving for that anymore .
Her familiar concerns -- environmental devastation and energy shortages -- do n’t seem like remnants of the 1970s but have become pertinent all over again .
“ Writing science fiction and fantasy allow you to back off a little bit , ” she says , sipping an Oregon beer on her deck , “ to try to find the problems that always come back , that we never solve .
Like gender relations , war -- once there ’s more than 50 of us living in one place we seem to have war .
“ How do we and why do we enslave one another ?
Slavery is maybe another way of saying class .
And of course race , which is involved in the others .
I ’m just circling around these subjects , which have become somewhat clearer to me as I ’ve gotten older , as being the big problems . ”

CAPE CANAVERAL , Florida ( Reuters ) - NASA cannot continue on its present path , which includes staffing the International Space Station and returning astronauts to the moon by 2020 , and fulfill its ultimate goal of getting people to Mars , the U.S. space agency ’s new chief said on Tuesday .
NASA is trying to finish construction of the $ 100 - billion space station and retire the shuttle fleet next year .
It also is developing two new rockets and a capsule - style craft that can ferry crews to the moon and other destinations in addition to the station , which orbits 225 miles above Earth .
“ We can not continue to survive on the path that we ’re on right now , ” Charlie Bolden , a retired Marine Corps general and four - time shuttle astronaut , said in a speech to NASA employees .
Bolden said he believes the space program ’s long - term objective is sending people to Mars .
“ The challenge for us in the next few months is to figure out what the single most efficient , most cost - effective path is to get there , ” he said .
Bolden was appointed NASA administrator by President Barack Obama ’ administration in May , about five years after his predecessor , President George W. Bush , set a goal for the agency to retire the shuttle fleet by 2010 , resume sending humans to the moon by 2020 and then push on to Mars .
Returning astronauts to the moon was estimated in 2005 to cost about $ 110 billion , but that figure has since been cut by about $ 40 billion .
NASA spends about half of its $ 18 billion annual budget on human spaceflight .

A presidential panel is reviewing options for the U.S. human space program and is expected to issue its report next month .
Bolden told workers the review is “ nothing to be afraid of . ”
Concurrently , a second review that encompasses all areas of space -- military , commercial , civil and scientific -- is under way by the national security advisor , James Jones , a retired four - star Marine general , Bolden said .
“ There needs to be a coherent policy and so President Obama has asked General Jones to put together a group to take a look at the national space policy , ” Bolden said .
“ That ’s already under way to a limited extent but we hope to be participating in that as a full member . ”
Bolden ’s address to NASA employees came seven days into space shuttle Endeavour ’s 16 - day construction mission to the International Space Station .
For a while everyone thought it would be enough to blame Dick Cheney .
President Obama assured the CIA that no one in the agency would be held accountable for the years of torture , abductions and killings , along with the mass surveillance of Americans , conducted under dubious legal authorisations .
America 's intelligence community breathed a sigh of relief at what it took to be a commitment that if anyone was to be brought to book it would be the politicians who the agency enthusiastically served as it slipped the leash of legal restraint , particularly the former vice - president who fronted the Bush administration 's war on terror .
Most doubted that anyone would be held accountable .
But in recent days the ground has shifted dramatically , as a slew of revelations about the CIA 's activities has left the agency facing its most hostile scrutiny since the 1970s , when congressional hearings revealed that it was pursuing its own , often illegal , agenda including numerous failed attempts to kill Fidel Castro .
Amid growing calls from within Congress for formal investigations and special prosecutors , former CIA officers say embittered agency officials believe they are caught up in a political war as the Democrats wield their newly acquired power to hit back at old foes in the Bush administration , particularly Cheney .
The CIA 's critics say that it is coming under belated scrutiny over its submission to a highly political and possibly illegal agenda that its officials embraced with enthusiasm in the febrile atmosphere after the 9/11 attacks , when the Bush administration thought it could throw out the rule book by declaring the Geneva conventions out of date and redefining long established parameters for torture .
Even where questionable practices were declared legal by the administration , they remained of dubious morality such as the practice of kidnapping suspected terrorists and flying them half way around the world to be tortured and interrogated , known as rendition .
Some former CIA officers , including the former counter - terrorism chief of operations , Vincent Cannistraro , say the agency involved itself in suspect practices as it rode roughshod over long established restraints .
" There were things the agency was involved with after 9/11 which were basically over the edge because of 9/11 .
There were some very unsavoury things going on .
Now they are a problem for the CIA , " he said .
" There is a lot of pressure on the CIA now and it 's going to handicap future activities . "
The CIA made two mistakes .
The first was to think that it could keep it all hidden .
There is much that will never be made public , it was perhaps inevitable that something damaging would come out .
As it happens , a slew of revelations have emerged with shocking speed .
In recent days , the agency has admitted hiding from Congress - probably illegally - a covert anti-terrorism programme .
Numerous leaks have revealed it to be an operation to kill al - Qaida operatives , sometimes in friendly countries .
The leaks have not been denied by the CIA or members of Congress since informed about the programme .
That revelation came days after five federal inspectors general released a report in to the role of the CIA and the National Security Agency in to warrantless wiretaps and other surveillance at the behest of the White House .
The CIA was just reeling from that blow when the attorney general , Eric Holder , said he wants a probe in to whether the agency was using waterboarding and other tortures even before the administration gave dubious legal opinions which cleared the way and swept aside years of precedent .
Few doubt that there will be more revelations to come , particularly if an increasingly agitated Congress decides to dig deeper .
Peter Bergen , an expert on intelligence at the New America Foundation , said that the CIA is not likely to be put through the wringer in quite the way it was in the 1970s when senator Frank Church 's committee laid bare an array of illegal activities .
But the agency will have to account for recent actions .
" The abuses by the CIA that Church revealed were worse than anything likely to come out of this .
There were eight separate attempts to assassinate Castro .
But the steady drip drip of revelations that 's coming out now is very damaging to the CIA , " he said .
" The cumulative effect is a very large amount of dirty laundry will be aired and it will have an effect on the CIA , a very damaging effect . "
Shortly after he assumed the presidency Obama reassured CIA officers that they would not be held to account for the abuses of the Bush years .
Some took that to mean that the slate was wiped clean and that if there was to be any accounting at all it would be of a narrow group of political leaders .
Obama was keen not to lose the support of the security establishment , particularly as he faced down Republicans and some of his own party over the dismantling of the Guantanamo prison and the release of its inmates .
But Bergen said that the recent revelations have undercut Obama 's assurances and encouraged Congress to wade in .
" All these things contribute to create the possibility to have a special prosecutor without being accused of a witch hunt , " said Bergen .
There are many in the CIA who remain convinced that the agency is caught up in a political vendetta in part aimed at clearing the speaker of the house , Nancy Pelosi , of accusations she lied when she said the CIA hid waterboarding from her at intelligence briefings .
Cannistraro said the fact that there was a leak after the CIA director , Leon Panetta , recently admitted to the intelligence committee about the secret assassination programme has reinforced the perception that Congress is unreliable and the agency is caught in a political web .
" There 's concern at the agency that they brought it to Congress 's attention and it promptly leaked , " he said .
But Cannistraro said that there is also a recognition within the CIA that the ground has shifted .
" The impulse for revealing this [ secret programme ] came from far below Panetta 's office .
It 's part of the process to protect the hind quarters of the agency itself because there are things they recognise were over the edge , " he said .
Cannistraro said that scrutiny of the CIA will require further examination of the politicians involved , and that it wo n't stop with the former vice - president .
" They keep specifying Cheney , but what Cheney did was endorsed by the president and Bush 's office .
This was not a one - man operation , " he said .
The CIA 's second , and perhaps greater mistake , was that all of the dark programmes appear to have been largely for nothing .
There is now ample evidence that interrogators learned most of what al - Qaida detainees had to tell before they were repeatedly water boarded .
Rendition , torture and Guantánamo are likely to have done more to have enhanced terrorism than curb it .
The inspector general of the justice department said of the secret surveillance programme that most of its leads " were determined not to have any connection to terrorism " .
" There are plenty of people who view that the ends justifies the means , " said Bergen .
" The problem with Cheney is there were not ends .
The waterboarding derived intelligence of no great value .
I think it 'll become clear these extreme measures were counterproductive and above all did n't find anything .
That is going to be a very damning judgement for the CIA . "

Bill Gates confessed at an event in New Delhi today that he gave up on Facebook because he could n't keep up with the friend requests .
Gates remarked that there were " 10,000 people wanting to be my friends " after he tried out the service , and it was time consuming to decide if he " knew this person , did I not know this person " .
Gates was speaking at a gathering to accept the Indira Gandhi Prize for Peace , Disarmament and Development on behalf of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation .
In addition to saying that Facebook " was just way too much trouble so I gave it up " , the AFP story on the event quotes Gates as saying he 's " not that big at text messaging " .
The Microsoft co-founder also mentioned that he does n't spend all day using technology and that " All these tools of tech waste our time if we 're not careful . "
And while Gates insists that he 's " not a 24 - hour - a - day tech person " , it 's clear that a growing number of Facebook users are - it's the very reason why Microsoft has a stake in the networking giant , as users ' time and attention are increasingly consumed by these somewhat addictive services .
We have no idea what Bill Gates ' Facebook page looks like , but we'd like to imagine it 's similar to this hilarious mockup , courtesy of PC World :
BEIJING , China ( CNN ) --
The number of abortions performed in China each year tops 13 million , with inadequate knowledge of contraception playing a major role in the annual tally , state - run media reported .
Chinese officials say more use of contraception could help prevent the large number of abortions .
" Sex education needs to be strengthened , with universities and our society giving more guidance , " Li Ying , a professor at Peking University , told China Daily .
Research from the National Population and Family Planning Commission 's technology research center shows nearly half of the women who had abortions had not used any form of contraception , Wu Shangchun , a division director , told the newspaper .
" The challenge of reducing [ the number ] of women seeking abortions in China is tough , " Wu said , according to China Daily .
China has a strict one - child policy , which the government has used to control its population growth .
Abortion is legal in China and is widely used as a birth - control method .
The story in state - run media is a rare look into the numbers behind the nation 's family planning policy .
The United States with a population roughly a quarter that of China reported less than a 10th of the number of abortions -- 820,151 -- in 2005 , the most recent year figures were available from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
Social changes across the nation have made the task more difficult , Yu Dongyan , a hospital gynecologist , told China Daily .
" Sex is no longer considered taboo among young people today , and they believe they can learn everything they need from the Internet , " according to Yu .
" But it does n't mean they 've developed a proper understanding or attitude toward it . "
Government statistics show that about 62 percent of the women who have abortions are aged between 20 and 29 , and most are single .
The actual number of abortions performed is much higher , Wu said , because the figures are collected only from registered medical institutions .
Many abortions are performed in unregistered clinics , according to Wu .
Abortions in China cost about 600 yuan , or $ 88 , China Daily reported .
Some family planning advocates have found it difficult to promote sex education in schools because some teachers and parents believe it will encourage sex activity .
Sun Aijun , a gynecologist at Beijing Union Hospital , said many unmarried couples use condoms , but added that some women find it difficult to turn down a partner 's request not to use them .

PSP
Go is the talk of E3 opening
Leaked images of a new Sony PSP console A new version of Sony 's PlayStation Portable games console is expected to be launched at the E3 video games show .
Video and photos of the PSP
Go have been leaked online , revealing a smaller , more lightweight console that has dropped the failed UMD disk format .
There have also been reports that Sony will announce a re-designed , slimmer PlayStation 3 but BBC
News understands this will not be launched at E3 .
The new PS3 model will be out later this year , BBC News understands .
Microsoft will kick start proceedings at E3 in Los Angeles with a press conference on Monday , at which the company is expected to showcase a raft of new features for its online games and content service , Xbox Live .
The PSP
Go is said to be smaller and lighter than the current PSP models
There have been reports that Microsoft will show off a new controller that uses many of the same features as Nintendo 's Wiimote , as the company tries to broaden the appeal of its console to non-gamers .
Sony is expected to unveil the PSP
Go on Tuesday , following a number of high - profile leaks of announcements to come out of the firm in the last few weeks .
The most recent , about the PSP Go , came after an official video showcasing the new device was mistakenly posted to a Sony website before being hurriedly pulled .
In the video , Sony 's John Koller said : " It 's a 3.8 - inch screen , it 's 43 % lighter than the PSP - 3000 , 16 gigs flash memory , Bluetooth support and all digital content so the UMD drive goes away .
" So it 's going to be something a lot of consumers like - download straight to a hard drive . "
A spokesman for Sony would not confirm the launch of the PSP Go but said any announcements would be given on Tuesday .
Industry leader Nintendo is expected to focus on new software for its popular Wii console .
It is also likely to announce the availability of its Wii Motion Plus device , which adds greater sensitivity and control to its controllers , along with games that support the add-on .
Nintendo needs a big show after last year 's announcements were criticised for being lack lustre , and recent evidence of a slow down in sales of its Wii console .
Analyst Mike Hickey , of Janco Partners , told the AFP news agency : " Nintendo needs something ; everyone is saying that . "

Overview
KMPlyer is a versatile freeware media player that supports many video file formats and containers .
It can also handle various types of subtitle files .
Review
My favorite video player right now is the open source SMPlayer , I like the way it works and of course I love the fact that it ’s open source .
But since many people asked me over and over to try KMPlayer I finally decided to give it a go .
I installed it in my PC a few months ago and I played some video files with it from time to time .
Now it ’s the moment to evaluate the program and see if I ’ll keep it or if it will get uninstalled .
First of all the program supports various types of container formats such as VCD , DVD , AVI , MKV , Ogg Theora , OGM , 3GP , MPEG , WMV , RealMedia or QuickTime .
So you can say that it plays just about anything .
It can also handle various subtitle formats , from the widespread .srt to closed captions or transport stream subtitles .
And above all it has a quite low memory footprint .
The first impression that I had after looking at the interface was that it ’s quite simple and clean , not clogged with too many commands , bars and menus .
But if you get deep into the program settings you ’ll have quite a good time , there are countless options that you can customize to suit your needs and taste .
The feature that I liked the most was the nice control box that can be opened alongside the main video window .
That ’s when KMPlayer can no longer be simple , it gets very complex for the users that want to customize and play with the various video , audio or subtitle settings .
Overall this freeware program looked pretty solid , it never crashed while I used it and it is versatile indeed – you can use it as a simple video player or you can tweak your heart out through the control box or the preferences panel .
Version Tested
2.9.4.1434
Author

Operating System
Windows XP , Vista

Summary
Simple and complex at the same time .
Can play virtually anything you throw at it .
The latest version was released in December 2008 .
Rating
Verdict
The only concern that I have regarding KMPlayer is that the latest version was released in December last year , nothing new since then .
Overall it looks better than SMPlayer , it has way better DVD support and can handle some file formats that SMPlayer does not just yet .
On the other hand SMPlayer is open source , so there ’s much more potential for future development .
I ca n’t make up my mind yet , so I ’ll keep both programs for a while and maybe wait to see how and if they develop .

Article Index Inside the Computer - Addressing Addressing Modes Stacking Page 1 of 3
Where you store data is as important to the computer as the data itself , yet the importance of the address is often overlooked .
In this introduction to the low - level mechanisms of addressing in assembler , it is surprising how easy it is to recognize familiar high - level abstractions .
We know where you live
The two fundamentals of the computer ’s universe are data and address .
The data is what you store and the address is where you store it .
Most of the time we concentrate on the data – what is stored and how it is stored - and the address is ignored as a simple number that retrieves the data .
In the real world of practical computers , however , the situation is very different .
The data is almost boring but how you find it requires a complex and exciting range of techniques .
It 's all about knowing where the data lives once you have found it generally what you do with it is fairly simple .
So let ’s take a closer look at the way addresses are generated and used .
The whole principle of computer operation is that an address automatically selects a memory location and data is either stored there or retrieved equally automatically .
In another article we look at the way that the processor , or CPU , interacts with memory to run a program .
The most important point however is that an address is not a passive label - it actively selects the data .
That is there is a mechanism in place where you present the address and the data is more - or - less instantly retrieved without you having to do anything extra .
Inside the CPU are special areas of storage called “ registers ” .
Exactly what you call these registers varies from machine to machine but most have something that corresponds to a program counter or PC register and some general purpose registers .
The program counter ( PC ) is a register that holds the address of the next instruction to be obeyed , i.e. to be fetched from memory , decoded and executed .
Other registers are used to store and operate on the data – the A register or Accumulator , for example .
Notice that the A register can be thought of as a “ data register ” and the PC register can be thought of as an “ address ” register .
In hardware terms these differences amount to which bus – address or data – the register is connected to .
In more advanced machine designs the distinction between address or data registers becomes blurred and a register may operate as a data register one moment and as an address register the next .
Inside the Pentium
To make this discussion a little more realistic let ’s take the case of a real processor – the Intel Pentium and the whole of the x86 family - because there has n’t been much change since they were first introduced .
To keep things simple we will look at a 32 bit design .
A 64 bit Pentium has registers that extended beyond 64 bits but nothing new in principle - it just gets increasingly confusing .
A 32 bit Pentium has a 32 - bit register called EAX which is essentially the A register , or Accumulator .
This started life as an 8 - bit A register , grew to a 16 - bit AX register and then doubled in size to become the EAX 32 - bit register .
However , in addition to the EAX register the Pentium has more than seven others to keep us occupied – what do they all do ?
What ’s inside the Pentium
In the Pentium ’s assembly language a simple instruction to load the EAX register is written : MOV EAX , address where address is the 32 - bit address that EAX is to be loaded from .
Notice that we are using a convenient mnemonic to write down the machine code .
This mnemonic is called “ assembler ” and it is converted to machine code , i.e. raw binary instruction codes , before it is run by the processor .
That is , the MOV is replaced by the binary op code that is translated by the processor into move to the EAX register and the 32 - bit address that follows .
This conversion is just a matter of looking such things up in a table of instruction codes but most programmers prefer to use a program – called an assembler – to do the job .
Immediate addressing Now consider the sort of thing that you generally want to do in a program .
Suppose you only want to load the EAX register with the value 01 .
You could store the value 01 in a suitable memory location and then load it into the EAX register but this a round about way to do things .
What about making life easier and introducing a new instruction that loads the EAX register with the 32 - bit value that is included in the instruction ?
Think about this for a moment .
If you want to load a register with a number then the dumb way of doing it is to use an address to locate the value in memory .
The address is stored as part of the instruction and makes it necessary to use the address to retrieve the value from memory .
Would n't it be simpler to just put the value that you want to load into the instruction in place of the address ?
This is n’t difficult to achieve and in a way it is just a shortened version of the “ store in a memory location and then load ” method .
In this case the memory location is just the one that the instruction was stored in .
This sort of “ would n’t it be easier if ” approach is how processors slowly but surely become more complicated and more sophisticated .
Although everything could be done with just data stored in memory and instructions that contain the address of that data it turns out to be much more powerful to invent different ways - addressing modes - to specify where the data is .
One by one we tend to add “ addressing modes ” to make the programmer ’s life easier .
Time to take a look at some of the standard addressing modes .

Day show .
Also , someone sent me some scans of a few DNA Lounge flyers from the eighties , so I added a page for those ( linked to from the 1985 - 1999 calendar page . )
The RealVideo and " slideshow " webcasts are down ( though the Flash - based webcast is still up ) .
The drive died on the RealVideo encoder machine , and I really can't motivate myself to screw around with it , so it might be down for a while .
Presumably everybody is watching the Flash version these days anyway .
It may be time to just give up on Real .
Then there would be one less computer in here that I 'd have to think about .
That would be nice .
We 're on the front page of the SF Chronicle today !
It 's a great article about how ABC is attacking all of the other all - ages clubs in San Francisco for other non-alcohol - related reasons , like food sales and hours of operation .
State goes after legendary all - ages music clubs A teenager 's first concert is a rite of passage of sorts , and in San Francisco , that rite often is undertaken at one of the city 's inexpensive , small , all - ages music clubs - a type of business that owners warn might not survive much longer because of new enforcement efforts by state alcohol officials . [...]
Those venues could be forced to close , owners say , if the state Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control , better known as ABC , continues to impose rules that club attorneys argue are legally questionable and often unrelated to booze or safety issues .
Some of the clubs say they only recently learned about the new rules , which are not written into state law and have n't been enforced in the past .
For example , ABC has decreed that at least half of the clubs ' revenue must come from food sales .
The agency also is taking issue with minor operating changes , such as one club 's decision to open an hour later .
In almost every case , the San Francisco clubs who have been battling ABC have the support of neighbors and local leaders .
The article does n't mention DNA Lounge specifically , but this is absolutely the same fight that we 're in .
Though they 're going after us with a ridiculous " lewdness " charge , they 're going after all of the other clubs for whatever technicality they can find .
There is a clear pattern of abuse of power here .
Also , we just filed our official appeal of our permit revocation to the ABC appeals board :
The grounds for this appeal are that ( a ) the department has proceeded without , or in excess of , its jurisdiction ; ( b ) the department has not proceeded in the manner required by law ; ( c ) the decision is not supported by the findings ; ( d ) the findings are not supported by substantial evidence in the light of the whole record ; ( e ) there is relevant evidence , which , in the exercise of reasonable diligence , could not have been produced or which was improperly excluded at the hearing before the department , and ( f ) ABC Rules 143.2 and 143.3 are unconstitutional .
Photos are up of Thursday 's last - minute Green Day show .
Yeah , Green Day !
How did that happen , you 're probably wondering ?
Long story :
They called us the night before and asked .
Ok , it 's not such a long story .
We had to cancel an event that we had scheduled for that night , and it 's always a drag to have to do that , but the event we had was probably going to only get a hundred people , and Green Day sold out in 15 minutes on the day of the show .
What are you gonna do ?
It was a fantastic show .
They played for almost three hours , including the entirety of their not - yet - released new album .
The sound quality was amazing .
I do n't think I 've ever heard it sound so good in here .
My favorite part was when an 8 - year - old kid climbed from his parent 's shoulders onto the stage and Billie Joe said to him , " Go crowd surf , little man ! " and he did .
People were able to hold him up with one hand because he was so tiny .
My second favorite part was when Billie Joe forgot the lyrics to a song ( " We 've got a lot of songs ! " he said ) and pulled a girl up out of the audience to sing it for him .
She was n't a great singer , but she did know all the words !
We got some press on this one : New York Times , NME , and an Oakland Tribune article that was picked up in many other papers .
Like I mentioned last week , the RealVideo webcast has been ( mostly ) down for the last week or so , because the machine that runs it lost a drive and I have n't been able to talk myself in to the level of Linux - based self - abuse that would be required to get it working again .
I did try moving RealVideo on to another machine ( making the kiosk server do double duty as the video encoder ) but that machine just is n't fast enough to do both .
And audio is n't working on it .
And you remember how I love diagnosing Linux audio problems .
So , I see two options here , really :
One of you friendly people donate to me a modern , fast , Linux - capable PC to run this junk on ; or I just call it quits on RealVideo and assume that Justin.tv is good enough .
I do n't have access to any logs that would tell me the relative popularity of either the Justin.tv or RealVideo streams , so I can't really tell whether anyone is watching either of them .
If there is anyone out there who can think of a reason to keep the RealVideo stream going at all , please speak up now .
Some recent press on the War on Fun :
SF Weekly : ABC Vendetta Against All - Ages Venues ?
Coming on the heels of the state agency 's recent vendetta against the DNA Lounge , it seems fair to question what ABC 's real agenda is ; regulating nightclubs with ticky - tack infractions to the point where they are forced to go out of business does n't seem to be in the best interests of anyone .
And ABC 's Gestapo tactics seem a bit heavy - handed .
According to [ GAMH / Slim's publicist Leah ]
Matanky , " ABC has gone after all clubs with an All Ages license , DNA included .
Their goal seems to be to put each said venue out of business , in whatever way possible . "
SF Examiner : Squeezing the fun out festivals
Some are predicting that many of The City 's street fairs -- which range from outré gatherings such as the Folsom Street Fair to more traditional events like the North Beach Jazz Festival -- might vanish by next year .
" I think this is going to be the make - or - break year for about a half - dozen festivals , including ours , " said Brad Olsen , founder of the How Weird Street Faire that takes place every May in SoMa .
" The City bankrupts these events with the fees they charge . "
SF Bay Guardian : Can Fun police itself ?
Yesterday 's Bring Your Own Big
Wheel event showed how a weird , community - based event that draws thousands of people and even has a real element of danger can be remarkably responsible , well - organized , and self - policing , without any help from police or other city officials , who mostly stayed at bay until the event was over .
Nonetheless , city officials continue to insist on expensive permits and the hiring of too many police officers on overtime for most events , making it increasingly difficult to stage the fun that makes San Francisco what it is .
So here 's a funny story .
And by " funny " I mean , " so funny that I sometimes have a hard time getting out of bed . "
This is an old story , and has nothing to do with our current battles with the government .
Or with any other absurd lawsuits we might or might not currently be dealing with .
I did n't tell this story back when it happened because there were lawyers involved , and they always advise you to never say anything to anyone .
But it 's long over now , so now it can be told .
I guess .
Anyway .
Several years ago , there was some kind of scuffle and one of our customers who was dancing on the stage fell off and hurt her ankle .
She sued us .
I 'm not sure what exactly her reasoning was , but she did , because this is America , and you can sue anybody for anything .
She claimed she had spent $ 4,000 on medical bills ( chiropractors ! ) and asked for $ 500,000 in pain and suffering .
We learned in the discovery phase that this woman had also been in three automobile accidents in the previous two years , for which she had been going to chiropractors already .
How about that .
We submitted this claim to our insurance company , like you do , and their lawyers handled it .
They ended up settling the case by paying her around $ 11,000 .
And here 's where it gets fun :
Our deductible was $ 10,000 .
So the lawyer , who was working for the insurance company , did right by the insurance company .
It only cost them $ 1,000 !
But he did n't try to negotiate anything lower , because that would have been a waste of his time , since he was n't working for us , and that was the part we would have to pay .
Oh , but it gets better .
It turns out that the fine print on our insurance said , in longwinded , 4 - point , incomprehensible legalese , that the rates we had been paying for years were merely " estimates " .
So after our claim , the insurance company " audited " us , and retroactively raised our rates for the last four years by $ 20,000 per year .
So the fact that we filed a claim at all caused the insurance company to demand an additional $ 80,000 from us .
At that point , we hired our own lawyer who negotiated that $ 80,000 down to $ 40,000 , paid out over a year instead of being due immediately .
Plus several thousand more for the new lawyer , obviously .
In summary ...
Customer with a fake injury sues us for half a million dollars .
Ends up getting $ 11 k , of which her lawyer probably takes half .
We 're out almost $ 60 k .
Insurance company turns a $ 40 k profit .
What 's the lesson here , kids ?
I think it's , " people are scum " and / or " never start a business . "
...
I would be remiss were I not to take this opportunity to mention our legal defense fund .
Photos are now up of Hubba Hubba Revue , Caroline & Mole 's wedding , and of a last - minute free show we had this Saturday , a piano performance by Eric Lewis .
He was incredible .
My friend Cyan messaged me the night before looking for a venue for him to play a free show , and we managed to put it together at the last minute .
The tricky part was , we had to fit a piano through our front door , which I would n't have thought was possible , since there are two turns in that hallway .
But , once they took the legs off , it went right in !
Check out this video of his performance at TED .
Apparently he 's playing at the White House in a few weeks .
We tried to bill this show as a fundraiser for the legal defense fund , but , uh , let 's just say that did n't really work out so well .
Trying out something new : Facebook recently released Facebook Connect , which makes it relatively easy to add a " comments " box to any web page .
The comments appear embedded in the page , but are actually stored on Facebook .
So , I 've added that to the blog , here .
Click on the " Comments " link below to see them .
What do you think ?
Let me know how it works .
Also : I 'd like the comments box to match the color scheme on this page , but I can't figure out how to do that .
I 'm passing the css= attribute to the fb:comments tag , but either it's not loading that CSS file at all , or I guessed wrong about what the class names are .
Can anyone tell me what I 'm doing wrong , or show me an example of a site that uses Facebook Connect and manages to change the color scheme of the embedded comment area ?
Here 's a nice article on the Eric Lewis show in the Guardian UK .
Besides reviewing the show , the author also adds :
I 'm not kidding , ABC actually used the phrases " lewd behavior " and " injurious to the public welfare and morals " .
In San Francisco .
In 2009 .
Eat that , Lenny Bruce .
Yeah , I still boggle at that , too .
There are also some good video clips of the show on Youtube ; I 've added those to the photo gallery .
I 've started collecting links to DNA Lounge in the press in a somewhat less haphazard manner than previously .
Let me know if you come across any .
I also changed the front page of dnalounge.com a bit to hype the legal defense fund in a more " designy " way .
Yeah , I put up an image with text in it because I wanted it to be in the proper font .
What have I become .
I think this Facebook Connect commenting crap might be crap .
I still can't make the colors be right , and I do n't see any way to get it to notify me when people post new comments , which makes it pretty useless .
The four men behind the site said they would not pay the fine .
A Swedish court has thrown out a request for a retrial by the four men behind The Pirate Bay website .
The four were found guilty of promoting copyright infringement in April and face jail sentences and hefty claims for damages .
The Pirate Bay 's lawyers called for a retrial when it emerged that one of the judges in the case belonged to several copyright protection groups .
The Swedish court said the judge 's affiliations did not bias the case .
The Svea Court of Appeal said Judge Tomas Norstrom should have declared that he was a member of the Swedish Association for the Protection of Industrial Property and the Swedish Copyright Association before the case went to trial .
" The fact that he failed to shed light on this does not however mean that there was any wrongdoing during the proceedings that would require a retrial , " said the court in a statement .
" This was not a case of bias , " concluded the court .
No appeal is allowed against the judgement .
The Pirate Bay is well - known for hosting lists of links that give people access to pirated copies of movies , music , software and TV shows .
The Pirate Bay defended itself saying that it did not infringe copyright because none of the pirated material is stored on its servers .
The court found them guilty because , it said , they continued to operate the service even when they knew users were being pointed to pirated material .
The four men behind The Pirate Bay , Frederik Neij , Gottfrid Svartholm Warg , Carl Lundstrom and Peter Sunde , were sentenced to one year in jail and told to pay damages of 30 m
Swedish kronor ( £ 2.3 m , 2.7 m euros ) to entertainment companies such as Warner Bros and Sony Music Entertainment .
In response to the ruling Peter Sunde said The Pirate Bay would now file charges against Sweden for violating the human rights of the defendants .

Mr. Mozilo ’s up - by - the - bootstraps background and entrepreneurial success earned him accolades and outsize pay during the mortgage industry ’s heyday .
But he became a lightning rod for criticism in 2007 when subprime loans started to go bad and foreclosures escalated .
Image Angelo R. Mozilo , then the chief executive officer of Countrywide Financial Corporation , testifying on Capitol Hill in March 2008 .
Credit ... Jay Mallin/ Bloomberg News
The S.E.C. brought its case against the former Countrywide officials on its own ; Justice Department officials did not file criminal charges simultaneously with the commission , as is often the case .
But a securities law expert said this did not guarantee that Mr. Mozilo and his former colleagues were clear of being charged by criminal authorities .
“ It could mean that the Justice Department does not yet have a case proving the highest standard , beyond a reasonable doubt , ” said Lewis D. Lowenfels , at Tolins & Lowenfels in New York .
“ They may want to see what facts come out in the discovery in the S.E.C. case and there might be other people they are interested in .
Moreover , the S.E.C. is under so much pressure from Congress , they may want to move quickly and not wait for anybody . ”
Among the e-mail messages written by Mr. Mozilo and cited by the S.E.C. was one from April 13 , 2006 .
In it , Mr. Mozilo told Mr. Sambol and Mr. Sieracki that loans had been written by the company without regard for its processes and guidelines .
He went on to describe as “ poison ” subprime second mortgages , a product from Countrywide that required no down payment from a borrower .
In another e-mail message , Mr. Mozilo discussed a type of mortgage known as a Pay Option adjustable - rate loan .
This was one of the so - called affordability products that let borrowers pay a fraction of what they owed in principal and interest each month .
“ We have no way , with any reasonable certainty , to assess the real risk of holding these loans on our balance sheet , ” Mr. Mozilo wrote .
“ The bottom line is that we are flying blind on how these loans will perform in a stressed environment of higher unemployment , reduced values and slowing home sales . ”

Improvements in Sexual and Reproductive Health of Teens and Young Adults Slowing
After a period of improvement , trends in the sexual and reproductive health of U.S. teens and young adults have flattened , or in some instances may be worsening , according to a new report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
CDC analyzed data from 2002 - 2007 from the National Vital Statistics System and numerous CDC reports and surveys including the Youth Risk Behavior Survey of high school students , the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ( NHANES ) , the National Survey of Family Growth , the HIV / AIDS Reporting System , and the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System .
The data are reported in a Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report Surveillance Summary , " Sexual and Reproductive Health of Persons Aged 10 - 24 Years – United States , 2002 - 2007 . "
All the data are not new , but the goal of this report is to present data from multiple sources in order to summarize trends in the sexual and reproductive health of America 's young people .
Findings include :
There were approximately 745,000 pregnancies among U.S. females under age 20 in 2004 .
In 2006 , the majority of new diagnoses of HIV infection among adolescents and young adults between the ages of 10 and 24 occurred among those aged 20 - 24 years and among males .
About 1 million adolescents and young adults aged 10 - 24 years were reported to have chlamydia , gonorrhea , or syphilis in 2006 .
Nearly a quarter of females aged 15 - 19 years , and 45 percent of those aged 20 - 24 years , had a human papillomavirus ( HPV ) infection during 2003 - 2004 .
Approximately 100,000 females aged 10 - 24 years visited a hospital emergency department for a nonfatal sexual assault injury during 2004 - 2006 .
Although the sexual risk behaviors and negative health outcomes tended to increase with age , the youngest age group – youth 10 - 14 years of age – were also affected :
An estimated 16,000 pregnancies were reported among females in this age group in 2004 .
Approximately 17,000 young people in this age group were reported to have a sexually transmitted infection in 2006 .
During 2004 - 2006 , 30,000 females in this age group visited a hospital emergency department because of a nonfatal sexual assault injury .
Approximately one third of adolescents had not received instruction on methods of birth control before age 18 .
" This report identifies a number of concerns regarding the sexual and reproductive health of our nation 's young people .
It is disheartening that after years of improvement with respect to teen pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases , we now see signs that progress is stalling and many of these trends are going in the wrong direction , " said Janet Collins , Ph.D. , director of CDC's National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion .
Among the signs that progress has halted in some areas :
Teen birth rates increased in 2006 and 2007 , following large declines from 1991 - 2005 .
Rates of AIDS cases among males aged 15 - 24 years increased during 1997 - 2006 ( AIDS data reflects people with HIV who have already progressed to AIDS . )
Syphilis cases among teens and young adults aged 15 - 19 and 20 - 24 years have increased in both males and females in recent years .
The report also identifies a number of racial / ethnic disparities .
Hispanic teens aged 15 - 19 are much more likely to become pregnant ( 132.8 births per 1,000 females ) compared to their non-Hispanic black ( 128 per 1,000 ) and non-Hispanic white ( 45.2 per 1,000 ) peers .
Additionally , rates of new HIV and AIDS diagnoses among young adults were highest among non-Hispanic black youth across all age groups .
" This report serves as a reminder that adolescents and young adults in this country continue to be impacted by STDs , including HIV , " said Kevin Fenton , M.D. , director of CDC's National Center for HIV / AIDS , Viral Hepatitis , STD and TB Prevention .
" It is imperative that all of us at the national and community level work together to ensure STD and HIV prevention programs are reaching young people , particularly in communities with the greatest burden of disease . "

Steve McNair was perhaps the toughest quarterback to ever play the game – a modern day gladiator .
Time and time again McNair displayed gritty determination , playing hobbled and beaten , pushing through injury unlike any quarterback before him .
Possibly one of his most shining moments as as NFL quarterback came when he piloted the Tennessee Titans to mere inches of forcing overtime in Super Bowl XXIV against the Rams .
McNair singled handily carried the Titans down the field , essentially on one leg , only to be stopped on the goal line .
McNair threw a completion to recevier Kevin Dyson , who was stopped just inches from scoring the tying touchdown .
As a Saints fan I have seen Steve McNair play New Orleans only twice in his thirteen year career , once with the Titans and once with the Ravens .
In both games McNair displayed his leadership attributes and dogged determination to win , securing victories in both .
In 2003 , as a Titan , McNair lead his team to a 27 - 12 win over the Saints .
He completed 22 of 33 passes for for 252 yards and 2 touchdowns .
Then again in 2006 , as a Raven , he beat the Saints 35 - 22 .
McNair completed 17 of 23 passes for 159 yards and 2 touchdowns .
He also had a rushing touchdown .
Both performances were indicative of the type of player he was and should be recalled as .
I hope that he will be remembered for his body of work on the football field , not the mysterious circumstances surrounding his untimely death .
McNair ’s legacy is one of toughness , a dark horse that proved to the NFL that the boy from Alcorn State could play football .

What is all this money for ?...
It seems that Europe ’s banks have gotten into a mess in their own neighborhood that is comparable to the “ troubled assets ” that our financial institutions accumulated in the course of the housing bubble -- which they also shared .
These banks had a fit of irrational exuberance in Central and Eastern Europe in recent years , with the result that they now have at least $ 1.4 trillion -- and that is a conservative estimate -- in exposure there to loans that are certain to have a very high default rate .
The Obama administration has argued that the money is necessary to help provide a global stimulus , and to help poor people in poor countries .
But the facts do not support this claim .
Almost all of the agreements that the IMF has concluded since the global economic crisis began have included the opposite of stimulus programs : for example spending cuts or interest rate increases .
The amount of money that will help poor countries is tiny .
And it is difficult to see why the IMF would need hundreds of billions of dollars to help governments with balance of payments support : for sixteen Standby Arrangements negotiated since the crisis intensified last year , the total has been less than $ 46 billion .
On the other hand , European banks are facing potential losses in the hundreds of billions of dollars .
Some , like France ’s Societe Generale , have already gotten billions of dollars from the TARP bailout .
If the purpose of adding these vast sums to the IMF ’s coffers is to bail out these banks , then the taxpayers of the United States ( and other countries who are being asked to contribute ) ought to know about it .
Walt Minnick has the most reactionary voting record of any of the Democratic freshmen elected last November .
He 's voted more frequently with the GOP than with the Democrats and the leadership just lets him slide because his district is so hopelessly red-- the home of the Aryan Nations and America 's biggest concentration of neo -Nazis and domestic terrorists ( Obama barely managed a third of the vote last November ) .
Minnick has been very careful to tow a very right - wing line when it comes to voting , so right - wing in fact that the GOP 's # 1 recruitment target , state Treasurer Ron Crane , has just announced he wo n't challenge him .
The district likes Minnick ; he 's proven that despite the Democratic Party affiliation , he 's just like they are -- against anything remotely progressive and very much a part of what author Charles Pierce has dubbed Idiot America But all Minnick 's hard work in proving that he is n't really a Democrat could come crashing down next week if Rahm Emanuel forces him to vote for the 2009 Supplemental Budget .
True , continuing the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are popular in ID - 01 and the rest ofand , in fact , Minnick already voted " yes " on May 14th , along with 200 Democrats and all but 9 rebellious Republicans ( like Ron Paul ) .
The vote was in sync with his constituents , just as the yes votes from the two reactionary Democratic freshmen from Alabama , Bobby Bright and Parker Griffith -- politically very much the same as Minnick -- were also in sync with their constituents '
Hate Talk radio - fueled wishes .
But once Emanuel -- in effect the Karl Rove of the current administration -- saw the huge margin by which the Supplemental passed ( 368-60 ) , he decided to lard it up with something the virtually no Americans who are n't getting million dollar campaign contributions from the banksters would ever countenance .
The Senate sent the bill back to the House with an IMF amendment attached , an amendment that guarantees $ 108 billion in taxpayer money -- ineconomy when states from California to Alabama are cutting back on basic and crucial services -- to bail out European banks .
Any Blue Dog -- supposedly fiscally responsible Democrats -- who votes for this garbage legislation will deserve to be beaten next year .
According to John Boehner and Eric Canter , the 168 Republicans who voted for the Supplemental on May 14 have now decided to oppose it Their announced opposition is what caused Emanuel 's congressional henchman , Steny Hoyer , to pull the bill off the floor Friday and postpone the vote .
Suddenly Emanuel and the rest of the Bankster Bailout Bunch realized that with progressive Democrats against the Supplemental because of the wars , the GOP opposition would kill it .
So Emanuel and the BBB are cracking the whip , demanding Democrats toe the line -- offering bribes and threats .
Does Travis Childers ( Blue Dog - MS ) want that $ 100,000 earmark for the West Point Historic Post Office in West Point , Mississippi ?
If he votes " no " on the European bank bailout his $ 100 K may get lost in the shuffle .
We 're hearing reports that Emanuel is behaving like a mad dog again .
And , worse yet , the waste of taxpayer money is unlikey to even do any good -- and could actually make the recession worse .
Economist Mark Weisbrot , co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research , in Washington , has made the point that American taxpayers have been getting increasingly restive about these mega - bailouts ever since the Bush Regime rewarded incompetence and self indulgence from the too - big - to - fail banks last September with a $ 700 billion dollar blank check .
And now Obama wants to put another $ 108 billion down that sink hole ?
George Miller and Barney Frank , two members of the Democratic leadership , have already been reeled back in and are going to vote " yes . "
On the other hand , Jim Moran and several other Democrats who originally backed the Supplemental have no intention of voting for another $ 100 billion bankster bailout .
In the original vote , 3 Blue Dogs joined the progressives in voting " no , " Jim Cooper ( TN ) , Mike Michaud ( ME ) and Mike Thompson ( CA ) .
This week Emanuel will use all the ... skill he possesses -- does Jan Schakowskywant to run for the U.S. Senate ? for example -- in forcing the " no " votes to switch to " yes " and in holding the " yes " votes .
It 's hard to imagine that hard core anti-bailout Blue Dogs like Minnick , Bright , and Griffith will ever put themselves in such grave jeopardy by voting for something so hated in their districts .
Other conservative Democrats who will be pilloried by Republicans if they vote for the bailout include Ann Kirkpatrick ( AZ ) , Harry Mitchell ( AZ ) , Gabby Giffords ( AZ ) , Glenn Nye ( VA ) , Frank Kratovil ( MD ) , Suzanne Kosmas ( FL ) , Kathleen Dahlkemper ( PA ) , Travis Childers ( MS ) , Brad Ellsworth ( IN ) , Jason Altmire ( PA ) , Heath Shuler ( NC ) , Chris Carney ( PA ) , Dan Boren ( OK ) , Gene Taylor ( MS ) , Zack Space ( OH ) , Bill Foster ( IL ) , Mike McIntyre ( NC ) , Charlie Melancon ( LA ) , Joe Donnelly ( IN ) , Melissa Bean ( IL ) , Allen Boyd ( FL ) , John Barrow ( GA ) , Baron Hill ( IN ) , and Jim Marshall ( GA ) .
The Firedoglake action tool includes phone numbers of Congressmen who are keeping track of what their constituents have to say about the issues in this Frankenstein bill .
If your member is n't on the list , just calland tell them where you live and they 'll connect you with your Representative .
Monday and Tuesday are the days this battle can be won .

Intelligence in Recent Public Literature
By Stephen Kinzer .
New York : John Wiley and Sons , 2003 . 258 pages .
Reviewed by David S. Robarge
At an NSC meeting in early 1953 , President Dwight Eisenhower said " it was a matter of great distress to him that we seemed unable to get some of these down - trodden countries to like us instead of hating us . "
The problem has likewise distressed all administrations since , and is emerging as the core conundrum of American policy in Iraq .
In All the Shah's Men , Stephen Kinzer of the New York Times suggests that the explanation may lie next door in Iran , where the CIA carried out its first successful regime - change operation over half a century ago .
The target was not an oppressive Soviet puppet but a democratically elected government whose populist ideology and nationalist fervor threatened Western economic and geopolitical interests .
The CIA 's covert intervention — codenamed TPAJAX — preserved the Shah 's power and protected Western control of a hugely lucrative oil infrastructure .
It also transformed a turbulent constitutional monarchy into an absolutist kingship and induced a succession of unintended consequences at least as far ahead as the Islamic revolution of 1979 — and , Kinzer argues in his breezily written , well - researched popular history , perhaps to today .
British colonialism faced its last stand in 1951 when the Iranian parliament nationalized the sprawling Anglo - Iranian Oil Company ( AIOC ) after London refused to modify the firm 's exploitative concession .
" [ B ] y a series of insensate actions , " the British replied with prideful stubbornness , " the Iranian Government is causing a great enterprise , the proper functioning of which is of immense benefit not only to the United Kingdom and Iran but to the whole free world , to grind to a stop .
Unless this is promptly checked , the whole of the free world will be much poorer and weaker , including the deluded Iranian people themselves . "
Of that attitude , Dean Acheson , the secretary of state at the time , later wrote : " Never had so few lost so much so stupidly and so fast . "
But the two sides were talking past each other .
The Iranian prime minister , Mohammed Mossadeq , was " a visionary , a utopian , [ and ] a millenarian " who hated the British , writes Kinzer .
" You do not know how crafty they are , " Mossadeq told an American envoy sent to broker the impasse .
" You do not know how evil they are .
You do not know how they sully everything they touch . "
The Truman administration resisted the efforts of some British arch - colonialists to use gunboat diplomacy , but elections in the United Kingdom and the United States in 1951 and 1952 tipped the scales decisively toward intervention .
After the loss of India , Britain 's new prime minster , Winston Churchill , was committed to stopping his country 's empire from unraveling further .
Eisenhower and his secretary of state , John Foster Dulles , were dedicated to rolling back communism and defending democratic governments threatened by Moscow 's machinations .
In Iran 's case , with diplomacy having failed and a military incursion infeasible ( the Korean War was underway ) , they decided to take care of " that madman Mossadeq " through a covert action under the supervision of the secretary of state 's brother , Director of Central Intelligence ( DCI ) Allen Dulles .
( Oddly , considering the current scholarly consensus that Eisenhower was in masterful control of his administration , Kinzer depicts him as beguiled by a moralistic John Foster and a cynical Allen . )
Directing the operation was the CIA 's charming and resourceful man in Tehran , Kermit Roosevelt , an OSS veteran , Arabist , chief of Middle East operations , and inheritor of some of his grandfather Theodore 's love of adventure .
The CIA 's immediate target was Mossadeq , whom the Shah had picked to run the government just before the parliament voted to nationalize the AIOC .
A royal - blooded eccentric given to melodrama and hypochondria , Mossadeq often wept during speeches , had fits and swoons , and conducted affairs of state from bed wearing wool pajamas .
During his visit to the United States in October 1951 , Newsweek labeled him the " Fainting Fanatic " but also observed that , although most Westerners at first dismissed him as " feeble , senile , and probably a lunatic , " many came to regard him as " an immensely shrewd old man with an iron will and a flair for self - dramatization . "
Time recognized his impact on world events by naming him its " Man of the Year " in 1951 .
Mossadeq is Kinzer 's paladin — in contrast to the schemers he finds in the White House and Whitehall — but the author does subject him to sharp criticism .
He points out , for example , that Mossadeq 's ideology blinded him to opportunities to benefit both himself and the Iranian people : " The single - mindedness with which he pursued his campaign against [ the AIOC ] made it impossible for him to compromise when he could and should have . "
In addition , Mossadeq failed at a basic test of statecraft — trying to understand other leaders ' perspectives on the world .
By ignoring the anticommunist basis of US policy , he wrenched the dispute with the AIOC out of its Cold War context and saw it only from his parochial nationalist viewpoint .
Lastly , Mossadeq 's naïvete about communist tactics led him to ignore the Tudeh Party 's efforts to penetrate and control Iranian institutions .
He seemed almost blithely unaware that pro-Soviet communists had taken advantage of democratic systems to seize power in parts of Eastern Europe .
By not reining in Iran 's communists , he fell on Washington 's enemies list .
Kinzer throws this fair - minded assessment off kilter , however , with a superfluous epilogue about his pilgrimage to Mossadeq 's hometown .
Intended to be evocative , the chapter sounds maudlin and contributes little to either an understanding of the coup or Kinzer 's speculations about its relevance today .
Kinzer is at his journalistic best when — drawing on published sources , declassified documents , interviews , and a bootleg copy of a secret Agency history of the operation —he reconstructs the day - to - day running of TPAJAX .
The plan comprised propaganda , provocations , demonstrations , and bribery , and employed agents of influence , " false flag " operatives , dissident military leaders , and paid protestors .
The measure of success seemed easy enough to gauge — " [ a]ll that really mattered was that Tehran be in turmoil , " writes Kinzer .
The design , which looked good on paper , failed on its first try , however , and succeeded largely through happenstance and Roosevelt 's nimble improvisations .
No matter how meticulously scripted a covert action may be , the " fog of war " affects it as readily as military forces on a battlefield .
Roosevelt may have known that already — he and his confreres chose as the project 's unofficial anthem a song from the musical Guys and Dolls : " Luck Be a Lady Tonight . "
TPAJAX had its surreal and offbeat moments .
Kinzer describes Roosevelt calmly lunching at a colleague 's house in the embassy compound while " [ o ] utside , Tehran was in upheaval .
Cheers and rhythmic chants echoed through the air , punctuated by the sound of gunfire and exploding mortar shells .
Squads of soldiers and police surged past the embassy gate every few minutes .
Yet Roosevelt 's host and his wife were paragons of discretion , asking not a single question about what was happening . "
To set the right mood just before Washington 's chosen coup leader , a senior army general named Fazlollah Zahedi , spoke to the nation on the radio , US officials decided to broadcast some military music .
Someone found an appropriate - looking record in the embassy library and put on the first song ; to everyone 's embarrassment , it was " The Star - Spangled Banner . "
A less politically discordant tune was quickly played , and then Zahedi took the microphone to declare himself " the lawful prime minister by the Shah 's order . "
Mossadeq was sentenced to prison and then lifetime internal exile .
The Shah — who reluctantly signed the decrees removing Mossadeq from office and installing Zahedi , thereby giving the coup a constitutional patina — had fled Iran during the crucial latter days of the operation .
When he heard of the successful outcome from his refuge in Rome , he leapt to his feet and cried out , " I knew it !
They love me ! "
That serious misreading of his subjects ' feeling toward him showed that he was out of touch already .
Seated again on the Peacock Throne , the insecure and vain Shah forsook the opportunity to introduce constitutional reforms that had been on the Iranian people 's minds for decades .
Instead , he became a staunch pro-Western satrap with grandiose pretensions .
He forced the country into the 20th century economically and socially but ruled like a pre-modern despot , leaving the mosques as the only outlet for dissent .
Although the next 25 years of stability that he imposed brought the United States an intelligence payoff the price was dependence on local liaison for information about internal developments .
The intelligence gap steadily widened , and Washington was caught by surprise when the Khomeini - inspired Islamist revolution occurred in February 1979 .
That takeover , according to Kinzer , links the 51 - year - old coup with recent and current terrorism .
With their devotion to radical Islam and their eagerness to embrace even the most horrific kinds of violence , Iran 's revolutionary leaders became heroes to fanatics in many countries .
Among those who were inspired by their example were Afghans who founded the Taliban , led it to power in Kabul , and gave Osama bin-Laden the base from which he launched devastating terror attacks .
It is not far - fetched to draw a line from Operation Ajax through the Shah 's repressive regime and the Islamic Revolution to the fireballs that engulfed the World Trade Center in New York .
This conclusion , however , requires too many historical jumps , exculpates several presidents who might have pressured the Shah to institute reforms , and overlooks conflicts between the Shia theocracy in Tehran and Sunni extremists in Saudi Arabia , Afghanistan , and elsewhere .
Kinzer would have been better off making a less sweeping judgment : that TPAJAX got the CIA into the regime - change business for good — similar efforts would soon follow in Guatemala , Indonesia , and Cuba — but that the Agency has had little success at that enterprise , while bringing itself and the United States more political ill will , and breeding more untoward results , than any other of its activities .
Most of the CIA 's acknowledged efforts of this sort have shown that Washington has been more interested in strongman rule in the Middle East and elsewhere than in encouraging democracy .
The result is a credibility problem that accompanied American troops into Iraq and continues to plague them as the United States prepares to hand over sovereignty to local authorities .
All the Shah's Men helps clarify why , when many Iraqis heard President George Bush concede that " [ s ] ixty years of Western nations excusing and accommodating the lack of freedom in the Middle East did nothing to make us safe , " they may have reacted with more than a little skepticism .

Embarrassing remark by minister :
Internal Security Minister Yitzhak Aharonovitch , who meant to praise an undercover police agent in Tel Aviv , referred to him as an " Arabush " ( Hebrew equivalent of " sand nigger " ) Tuesday .
Following the incident , the minister 's office said he did not intend to insult anyone by using the derogatory term .
Aharonovitch later issued a more strongly worded apology over his remark .
The embarrassing incident took place while Aharonovitch was touring the vicinity of Tel Aviv 's old central bus station , a notoriously crime - ridden neighborhood .
The minister met with undercover police agents in the area , and when one of the , apologized for being " a little dirty , " Aharonovitch responded : " Why dirty ?
You look like a real Arabush . "
During the tour , the minister was briefed on crime trends in the area , problems faced by police , and the efforts undertaken by officials to address local crime .
Later Tuesday , Knesset Member Ahmad Tibi slammed Aharonovitch 's remark , saying " it would have sounded more authentic in German ... Israel is turning into a Jewish , Lieberman - style racist state . " "
" Yisrael Beiteinu , the Jewish fascist party , has become the world 's most racist government faction , " Tibi said .
Following criticism of the minister 's remark , Aharonovitch 's office issued the following statement : " During a tour the minister met with a police officer wearing dirty clothes , and in a moment of humor , while resorting to slang , he uttered a specific word with no intention to hurt anyone .
If anyone was insulted , this certainly was not the intention . "
Later , the minister said he wished to express his heartfelt apology over the remark he made .
" This expression does not express my worldview , and I wish to apologize to anyone who was hurt , " he said .

From the ' all your OS are belong to us ' files :
Intel ( NASDAQ : INTC ) is acquiring embedding software developer Wind River ( NASDAQ : WIND ) for $ 884 million .
Wind River is a company I 've been tracking for years as a key player in the embedded software operating system space , first with its proprietary VxWorks OS and since 2004 with Linux .
Wind River is also doing reasonably well in the current economy .
For its fiscal 2009 year , which ended on January 31 , 2009 , Wind River reported $ 359.8 million in revenue , a 9 percent increase in year over year increase .
Intel and Wind River are hardly strangers .
Wind River has been working closely with Intel for years , on both Moblin ( Mobile Linux ) as well in the in - car infotainment area .
What is particularly interesting though is the fact that in the embedded space , Wind River is not an Intel only embedded vendor .
In fact VxWorks works on a wide number of embedded processors as does its flavor of Linux .
In my view , the acquisition of Wind River gives Intel , a massive new entry point into the broad market for embedded software .
With Wind River , Intel gets a company that has been active in embedded development - both proprietary and open source - for years .
Having silicon and CPUs alone is simply not enough to drive adoption , what Intel is doing with this acquisition is recognizing once again that developers are the key and that software development tools and operating systems are the path to developers .
This acquisition will also change the competitive landscape somewhat .
MontaVista Linux which competes against Wind River is also a supporter of Intel 's Moblin .
MontaVista however also supports more processors than just Intel and perhaps could use the fact that it is not owned by Intel as leverage with other embedded silicon vendors .
It 's a bold step for Intel and certainly one that will shake up the embedded market .
It will be interesting to see how Intel uses its Wind River assets to either support other silicon vendors or drive more device vendors to Intel platforms .
Update : My apologies .
I initially misquoted the number of Tricare beneficiaries , astutely noted by Cinnamon Rollover .
My intent of this diary was certainly not to overstate Tricare numbers .
I made the changes to the diary to reflect a more accurate number of beneficiaries ( teh damn google ) .
Thanks for the catch Cinnamon .
So much for the perfect first post .
According to the GAO website :
TRICARE is the Department of Defense ’s ( DOD ) health care system for active duty
and retired uniformed service members and their families .
TRICARE consists of four
separate programs .
Three of these programs — TRICARE Prime , a managed care
option ; TRICARE Extra , a preferred provider option ; and TRICARE Standard , a fee
for service option — cover active duty personnel , their dependents , and retirees under
age 65 .
According to the 2008 Tricare Stakeholder 's Report :
More than 9 million Americans rely on us for their health care needs
9.2 Million active duty and retired uniformed service member and their families receive their healthcare from the federal government .
My family and I receive free healthcare from the federal government .
I repeat , over 9 million citizen already receive their healthcare from the federal government .
I provide healthcare for the federal government .
I 'm an active duty obstetrician / gynecologist in a major medical facility on the East Coast .
I 'd like to share a couple of observations regarding the current single payer healthcare system that I work in and for which my family receives its care .
" Rationing " of healthcare in this single payer system is simply not reality .
As a physician in one of the busiest departments ( over 4000 deliveries / year ) in the military , I practice with the same diagnostic technology , with the same subspecialty support as my civilian colleagues .
If I have a patient who is in preterm labor , I simply walk down the hallway , talk to the maternal fetal medicine specialist ( high risk obstetrician ) , admit her to the hospital .
I have the utmost confidence that she will be taken care of in the best way possible and that if she does deliver early , the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit ( NICU ) will use every available technology to rescucitate and care for the premature baby .
If my patient has pre eclampsia or postpartum cardiomyopathy or any other serious conditions , she is cared for in the exact same way as any civilian hospital in the country .
Only one caveat - when they get discharged , their bill is always the same : $ 0 .
Single payer healthcare does not eliminate scientific inquiry , research , or the pursuit of evidence based medicine .
In fact , quite the opposite .
In my department alone , over 90 peer reviewed journal articles have been published since 2002 .
Research is vital to the medicine and anyone who goes through four years of undergraduate education , followed by four years of medical school , followed by three to six years of specialty residency obviously has an intellectual curiosity which will occur no matter who is " paying " for it .
Additionally , some of the best research and scientific breakthroughs , comes from physicians in those " socialized " European countries .
To say that progress and research in the field of medicine can only occur in our current system is disingenuous at best and insulting at worst .
Pre existing conditions do n't prevent patients from receiving care in our system , rather it is identified and considered in their current medical situation .
I 'm glad to know if my patient has diabetes or hypertension prior to her pregnancy and it simply allows me to give the best evidence based treatment during the time of her pregnancy .
When a patient sees me , she is my patient .
If she wishes to see someone else , she can see one of my colleagues .
I believe that is called choice .
Physicians , in general , like to see their patients and follow their progress and offer interventions when indicated .
I can prescribe any medications I wish if I believe it is the best for my patient .
Sure , there is a DoD formulary that guides many of my decisions , but this formulary if not static .
In fact , there are committees who meet regularly to add or subtract drugs based on ( I 'm hoping I establishing a pattern here ) the best available evidence .
If a medication is not on the core formulary , I simply put a notation in the prescription that states " nonformulary " and provide a reason that this medication is indicated .
While I do not prescribe nonformulary medications often ( there is often no need ) , I have never had a medication prescription not filled in the six years I 've practiced medicine .
This system is far from perfect .
The administrative bureacracy can be frustrating and often painful and confusing to patients and providers alike .
The electronic record that we use as providers called AHLTA is the most nonintuitive , mind numbingly inefficient program I have ever encountered .
There are many issues that could make this system better .
The point of this diary is not to suggest that the system I work in that all taxpayers are currently funding is the solution to our nation 's healthcare ailments .
I am struck however that nobody has brought up the simple fact that the government already provides free healthcare in a single payer model to over 9 million of its population .
While this system is not perfect , I believe I provide that same quality of care , offering empathetic , evidence based ( one more time for good measure ) care as any other physician who practices at any hospital in the country .
If you spent the time to read this , thanks for your time .
This community is vital to the progress of this issue and I value many of the opinions here .
After completing this , I also respect all who write diaries way better than my effort .
Let 's get universal healthcare for all !
Peace .
Update : I 'd like to thank everyone who commented on this thread .
I learned much from many of the comments and it is more than apparent that there are passionate and intelligent people in this community who all have similar goals regarding this topic .
This is not an issue that is going to be resolved overnight or without some hiccups .
The hard part , I think , is to move in the right direction with substantive legislation while knowing it is only the first step .
Frankly , I like our guy in the Office of the Presidency .
If anything , he appears to have the ability to distinguish the forest from the trees - a skill vital in this healthcare battle .
Again , thanks for the nice words .
Peace .

MOSCOW --
A prominent human - rights activist was kidnapped and killed Wednesday in Russia 's troubled Caucasus area , the latest incident in a spiral of violence in a region that the Kremlin had recently declared pacified .
Rights advocates blamed the pro-Kremlin strongman in the region , Chechen President Ramzan Kadyrov , for the killing of Natalya Estemirova .
Mr. Kadyrov , who swears loyalty to the Kremlin and calls Prime Minister Vladimir Putin a hero , has seen his own authority in Russia boosted in recent months , as the Kremlin declared an end to the war in Chechnya and turned over most antiterrorist operations to his troops .
A number of Mr. Kadyrov 's critics have been killed recently outside Russia in places such as Dubai , Istanbul and Vienna , crippling his political opposition .
Mr. Kadyrov , 32 years old , denies involvement in those killings and scoffs at allegations by human - rights groups that he and his forces torture , kidnap and kill opponents within Russia .
Mr. Kadyrov could n't be reached to comment Wednesday .
Ms. Estemirova worked for Russian human - rights group Memorial , gathering evidence of abuse by authorities in Chechnya since the beginning of the second war there in 1999 .
Witnesses said she was forced into a car in Grozny , the Chechen capital , as she headed to work Wednesday morning .
Her body was found hours later by a roadside in the neighboring province of Ingushetia .
Ms. Estemirova had been shot twice in the head at close range .
I did n’t know enough about antenna gain to define it if someone asked me to so I did some research .
Gain itself seems to be a tricky term to define , so I ’m going to have to explain a few other things along with it .
Antenna gain is basically measure of the effectiveness of a directional antenna as compared to a standard nondirectional antenna .
One of the major parameters used in analyzing the performance of radio frequency ( RF ) communications links is the amount of transmitter power directed toward an RF receiver .
This power is derived from a combination of :
1 – Transmitter power
2 – The ability of the antenna(s ) to direct that power toward an RF receiver (s ) .
Directivity
The directivity of the antenna is determined by the antenna design .
Directivity is the ability of an antenna to focus energy in a particular direction when transmitting or to receive energy better from a particular direction when receiving .
To determine the directivity of an antenna , we need a reference antenna with which to compare our antenna ’s performance .
Over the years there have been several different reference antennas used .
Today an isotropic radiator is preferred as the standard antenna for comparison .
The isotropic antenna transmits equal amounts of power in all directions ( like a light bulb ) .
To increase the directivity of a bulb ’s light ( the antenna ’s energy ) , similar to a flash light or automobile head lamp in this example , a reflector ( antenna ) is added behind the bulb .
At a distance , in the light beam , the light bulb now appears to be much brighter .
The amount that the bulb appears brighter compared to the bulb without a reflector is the directivity of the reflector ( antenna ) .
When the directivity is converted to decibels we call it the antenna gain relative to an isotropic source ( dBi ) .
Typically the higher the gain , the more efficient the antenna ’s performance , and the farther the range of the antenna will operate .
Roughly for every 6 dBi in gain , you double the range of the antenna .
It should be noted that many issues need to be considered when selecting the “ best ” antenna for the application , and you should discuss any antenna selection with someone knowledgeable in RF radiation and antenna performance .
So a better definition of antenna gain is :
A relative measure of an antenna ’s ability to direct or concentrate radio frequency energy in a particular direction or pattern .
The measurement is typically measured in dBi ( Decibels relative to an isotropic radiator ) or in dBd ( Decibels relative to a dipole radiator ) .
On April 15 , large , angry and some­what wacky crowds of Repub­li­can - backed and Fox News - sup­port­ed ​ “ tea par­ty ” pro­test­ers joined the usu­al groups of more sedate and earnest peace activists to demon­strate against Pres­i­dent Barack Obama ’s pro­posed 2010 budget
A Lockheed Martin machinist can’t become a social studies teacher overnight , but transitioning people from military production to more useful sectors of the economy is not rocket science .
Whether they were mad about deficit spend­ing and high tax­es or mil­i­tary spend­ing , Obama ’s bud­get of $ 3.55 tril­lion is a lot of money .
Much of those tril­lions are ori­ent­ed toward try­ing to fix the prob­lems of almost a decade of cor­po­ra­tions - can - do - no - wrong profli­ga­cy .
There is a lot to applaud in the bud­get , like increased spend­ing on health­care , edu­ca­tion and devel­op­ing sus­tain­able ener­gy .
But there are still huge mil­i­tary out­lays .
Obama ’s first Depart­ment of Defense bud­get requests $ 534 bil­lion in spend­ing , con­tin­u­ing a decade - long trend of unin­ter­rupt­ed increas­es .
( Indeed , under Bush , the Pentagon ’s base­line bud­get rose by 82 per­cent between FY 2002 and FY 2009 , adjust­ed for infla­tion . )
On April 6 , Defense Sec­re­tary Robert Gates announced the detailed bud­get with a small bit of fan­fare , declar­ing that his bud­get is intend­ed to ​“ reshape the pri­or­i­ties of America ’s defense estab­lish­ment , ” and that his rec­om­men­da­tions will ​“ pro­found­ly reform how this depart­ment does business . ”
Devil ’s in the details
Despite those buzzy action words , Gates ’ announce­ment was pret­ty cut and dry – a white - haired man read­ing from a sheaf of paper and respond­ing to ques­tions .
For the most part , the cuts he pro­posed were not dra­mat­ic in that they were ​ “ bud­get neu­tral . ”
Sav­ings from decid­ing not to order any more F‑22 Rap­tors goes towards pro­duc­tion of the F‑35 Joint Strike Fight­er .
There is ( maybe ) one few­er DDG - 1000 Zumwalt destroy­er , but no change in fund­ing for the Vir­ginia Class attack submarine .
There were some actu­al cuts to big tick­et items .
Star Wars mis­sile defense pro­grams were cut by $ 1.4 bil­lion , retain­ing more than $ 9 bil­lion a year in spend­ing on what is left of Reagan ’s fan­tas­tic promise to ren­der nuclear weapons ​ “ impo­tent and obso­lete . ”
The Army ’s Future Com­bat Sys­tem ( FCS ) – the trou­bled sys­tem of sys­tems designed to link togeth­er armed sol­diers , robot­ic sen­sors and com­bat vehi­cles with a sophis­ti­cat­ed com­mu­ni­ca­tions net­work – will be cut by $ 770 mil­lion , as Gates axes the vehi­cle com­po­nent .
Voic­ing his frus­tra­tion about cost over - runs and set­backs , Gates did raise the specter of can­ning the whole $ 87 bil­lion pro­gram if sig­nif­i­cant restruc­tur­ing was not successful .
Look­ing care­ful­ly at the Pen­ta­gon bud­get , Miri­am Pem­ber­ton , a mil­i­tary bud­get expert with the Insti­tute for Pol­i­cy Stud­ies , esti­mates that the pro­pos­als shave between $ 8.6 and $ 10.3 bil­lion from weapons pro­cure­ment funds .
If those cuts can be sus­tained , and if whole pro­grams like FCS are can­celed , the sav­ings could total $ 98 bil­lion even­tu­al­ly .
That would actu­al­ly edge us towards the sweep­ing rhetoric that accom­pa­nied the announcement .
Con­gress up in arms
But between here and there is a hornet ’s nest of Con­gres­sion­al parochial­ism , with Democ­rats and Repub­li­cans lin­ing up behind their friend­ly neigh­bor­hood mil­i­tary con­trac­tor and pre­dict­ing fun­da­men­tal com­pro­mis­es to our nation­al secu­ri­ty as a result of these cuts .
Sen. James Inhofe ( R‑Okla . ) , called Gates ’ bud­get the ​ “ dis­arm­ing of Amer­i­ca . ”
The axed vehi­cle in the FCS was sup­posed to be par­tial­ly built in Okla­homa .
Inhofe received $ 121,700 in defense indus­try cam­paign con­tri­bu­tions in the 2007 – 2008 elec­tion cycle .
Sen. Sax­by Cham­b­liss ( R‑Ga . ) accus­es Gates of being ​“ will­ing to sac­ri­fice the lives of Amer­i­can mil­i­tary men and women for the sake of domes­tic pro­grams favored by Pres­i­dent Oba­ma . ”
Parts for the F‑22 Rap­tor are built in Geor­gia .
Cham­b­liss received $ 140,300 in cam­paign con­tri­bu­tions from the defense indus­try in the 2008 cycle .
Six sen­a­tors sent Sec­re­tary Gates a let­ter protest­ing the pro­posed mis­sile defense cuts and pre­dict­ing they ​“ could under­mine our emerg­ing mis­sile defense capa­bil­i­ties to pro­tect the Unit­ed States against a grow­ing threat . ”
Togeth­er , the sen­a­tors received more than $ 855,000 from the defense indus­try in the 2008 cycle .
All of these protest­ing mem­bers of Con­gress cite the jobs sup­port­ed by weapons pro­grams .
But accord­ing to the Uni­ver­si­ty of Mass­a­chu­setts ’ Polit­i­cal Econ­o­my Research Insti­tute , an invest­ment of $ 1 bil­lion in defense cre­ates 8,555 jobs and $ 564.5 mil­lion wages and ben­e­fits .
That same amount , invest­ed in edu­ca­tion , cre­ates 17,687 jobs and $ 1.3 bil­lion in wages and ben­e­fits .
A Lock­heed Mar­tin machin­ist can’t become a social stud­ies teacher overnight , but tran­si­tion­ing peo­ple from mil­i­tary pro­duc­tion to more use­ful sec­tors of the econ­o­my is not rock­et sci­ence , and the ben­e­fits are lasting .
GWOT becomes ​ ‘ Over­seas Con­tin­gency Operations ’
Not only is this bud­get larg­er than the Bush administration ’s last bud­get ; it is just part of the pic­ture .
It does not include the full costs of ongo­ing wars .
At the end of March the Wash­ing­ton Post report­ed that the Defense Department ’s office of secu­ri­ty review sent a memo to Pen­ta­gon employ­ees say­ing , ​“ this admin­is­tra­tion prefers to avoid using the term ​‘ Long War ’ or ​‘ Glob­al War on Ter­ror ’ [ GWOT . ]
Please use ​‘ Over­seas Con­tin­gency Oper­a­tion . ’ ” Mem­bers of the Oba­ma admin­is­tra­tion quick­ly fell in line , with Office of Man­age­ment and Bud­get ( OMB ) Direc­tor Peter Orszag win­ning the prize for using it most often .
But what­ev­er one calls it , it is expensive .
As of Octo­ber last year , total costs for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan totaled $ 864 bil­lion .
Now it is Pres­i­dent Obama ’s turn to add to that num­ber .
In Obama ’s first and – he insists in the OMB release – last ​ “ planned war sup­ple­men­tal ” before these ​ “ costs are account­ed for in the bud­get ” the White House is request­ing $ 83.4 bil­lion for ongo­ing mil­i­tary , diplo­mat­ic and intel­li­gence oper­a­tions .
Of this , $ 75.5 bil­lion is for costs relat­ed to mil­i­tary oper­a­tions and intel­li­gence activ­i­ties in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Added into this mix are funds for four more F‑22 Rap­tors ( which extends the life of the weapons pro­gram that Sec­re­tary Gates just axed to save mon­ey ) .
The rest – $ 7.1 bil­lion – is allo­cat­ed for inter­na­tion­al affairs and sta­bi­liza­tion activ­i­ties in Iraq , Afghanistan and around the globe , includ­ing eco­nom­ic assis­tance to Geor­gia , counter - nar­cotics pro­grams in Mex­i­co , secu­ri­ty assis­tance in Lebanon and many oth­er bud­get lines .
Once passed , Obama ’s war sup­ple­men­tal will bring the total cost of ​ “ over­seas con­tin­gency oper­a­tions ” since Pres­i­dent Bush ’s Octo­ber 7 , 2001 , inva­sion of Afghanistan to $ 947 billion .
While it is a pos­i­tive move to bring war fund­ing into the bud­get rou­tine , this does not mean the Unit­ed States will stop spend­ing bil­lions a month any time soon .
Mil­i­tary oper­a­tions in Afghanistan – where Oba­ma is surg­ing U.S. forces – have so far cost more than $ 170 bil­lion , an aver­age of more than $ 20 bil­lion per year .
Spend­ing will rise sig­nif­i­cant­ly as the Unit­ed States sends more troops and attends more to the train­ing of Afghan secu­ri­ty forces .
Mil­i­tary and eco­nom­ic aid to Pak­istan is slat­ed to sharply increase and addi­tion­al civil­ian devel­op­ment aid to Afghanistan will be a cru­cial part of the mix as well .
These will be long - term efforts , not the work of a year , or two years , or even five years .
Then there is Iraq , where Oba­ma has pledged to respon­si­bly end the war .
But , con­trary to pop­u­lar belief , sav­ings gen­er­at­ed by reduc­tions in U.S. forces in Iraq are unlike­ly to be sig­nif­i­cant , at least for the next few years .
The planned reduc­tions are fair­ly grad­ual .
Even after the end of 2011 we may leave a resid­ual force of 50,000 or more mil­i­tary per­son­nel , along with an expand­ed con­tin­gent to train and equip the Iraqi armed forces .
In short , under Oba­ma , Pen­ta­gon spend­ing con­tin­ues to be out of control .
Tax­pay­ers yet unborn , gen­er­a­tions of them , will be on the hook for the near­ly $ 3 tril­lion – the amount bor­rowed plus inter­est to finance war oper­a­tions over the last decade .
Until now , most peo­ple bare­ly noticed the dol­lar cost because it was on the nation­al cred­it card .
But whether they tossed tea or piled pen­nies or filled out forms in April , the Amer­i­can peo­ple are begin­ning to notice that the bills are com­ing due .

Since # 3 , we have a way to pass more parameters than just the filter to the protocol the proxy is configured with .
​ GeoExt.data.FeatureStore - like Ext.data .
Store , but designed to represent features of a vector layer ( # 18 ) .
Layer and store can be synchronized .
GeoExt.data .
FeatureReader is used to read features from an OpenLayers .
Protocol .
Response , and each feature is represented by a GeoExt.data .
FeatureRecord .
GeoExt.data .
FeatureStoreMixin is available to create a custom store with the functionality to synchronize features with a layer .
With # 56 , support for complex mappings was introduced for the FeatureReader .
GeoExt.data.LayerStore , GeoExt.data.LayerReader and GeoExt.data .LayerRecord are designed to store layers and synchronize with a map 's layers array ( # 25 ) .
There is also a GeoExt.data .
LayerStoreMixin to create a custom store .
Since # 27 , the signature of LayerRecord matches the signature of Ext.data .
Record .
And since # 29 , custom readers can be used to populate a LayerStore .
With # 30 , we introduced new bind and undbind methods to connect to / disconnect from a map , replacing the former setMap method which was similar to the new bind method .
With # 38 and # 47 , some more API changes were introduced , making the LayerStore look more familiar to Ext JS developers used to Ext.data .
Store .
​ GeoExt.data.WMSCapabilitiesStore and GeoExt.data .WMSCapabilitiesReader are used to represent the contents of a WMS GetCapabilities response in a grid ( # 26 ) .
This is e.g. useful for selecting layers from the available layers of a WMS and add them to a map .
​ GeoExt.data .ScaleStore - a store used to present a map 's configured scales in a combo box ( # 41 ) .
It is always in sync with the map it is configured with .
Widgets
​ GeoExt . MapPanel - a panel providing an easily configurable OpenLayers map .
Initial version ( # 4 ) , configuration made easier with # 31 by allowing extent and center to be configured using arrays and # 35 by removing the Base Layer / Overlay dichtomy .
In # 45 the map panel was made aware of items that are added to / removed from it .
​ GeoExt . ZoomSlider - a zoom slider designed to replace the OpenLayers ZoomBar with a slider matching the Ext UI .
It can also be placed outside the map panel ( # 16 ) .
With # 89 , a new config property , " aggressive " , was added , which will force the update of map zoom while dragging ( if set to true ) .
By default , the map zoom will only be updated when dragging the slider is finished .
​ GeoExt . LegendPanel - a panel for displaying a legend of the layers visible in the map with legend graphics ( # 2 ) .
Respects layer order and visibility and updates with changes in the map .
​ GeoExt.tree .LayerNode - a tree node to use in Ext trees , representing a map layer ( # 22 ) .
Layer nodes can either be used directly in an Ext.
TreePanel , or ​ GeoExt.tree.LayerContainer , GeoExt.tree.BaseLayerContainer and GeoExt.tree .OverlayLayerContainer can be used to show all layers , base layers and overlay layers in a tree .
Like the LegendPanel , the tree components respect layer order and visibility , and update with changes in the map .
​ GeoExt . Popup - a specialized Ext . Window that can be anchored to OpenLayers vector features or locations on a map ( # 21 ) .
It is not limited to live inside a map panel ( #8 ) and can also be un-anchored from the feature / location and live on like a plain Ext .
Window .
​ GeoExt . Action - a convenient way to connect OpenLayers controls to Ext toolbar buttons and menu items ( # 67 ) .
​ GeoExt.form .
FormPanel - a specialized FormPanel that creates filters based on the values entered in the form , performing filtered requests using an OpenLayers .
Protocol ( # 49 ) .
This is e.g. useful for searching a WFS for features matching specific criteria .

Robert McNamara , Lyndon Johnson ’s icy - veined , cold - visaged and rigidly intellectual point man for a war that sent thousands upon thousands of people ( most of them young ) to their utterly pointless deaths , has died at the ripe old age of 93 .
Long after the horror of Vietnam was over , McNamara would concede , in remarks that were like salt in the still festering wounds of the loved ones of those who had died , that he had been “ wrong , terribly wrong ” about the war .
I felt nothing but utter contempt for his concession .
I remember getting my draft notice in the mid-1960s as Johnson ’s military buildup for the war was in full swing .
I ’m not sure what I expected .
Probably that the other recruits would be a tough bunch , that they would all look like John Wayne .
I was staggered on the first day of basic training at Fort Dix , N.J. , to be part of a motley gathering of mostly scared and skinny kids who looked like the guys I ’d gone to high school with .
Who looked , basically , pun intended , like me .
That ’s who was shipped off to Vietnam in droves  youngsters 18 , 19 , 20 and 21 .
Many , of course , would die there , and many others would come back forever scarred .
She finished her wine , ordered another .
She spoke in a laid - back , twangy way about Tony Romo , her parents , her career .
When I asked about her ex-husband and reality - show co-star , Nick Lachey , she said , “ I have not spoken to him in years . ”
When I asked if Tony Romo had watched Newlyweds , she said , “ A couple episodes .
He thought I was cute . ”
I did n’t want to ask about her weight directly , so I hinted at it , asking instead about body image in general , physical changes , perception — from my questions , you might have thought I was interviewing the Wolf Man .
“ It comes with what I do , ” she said , “ and I know that every day the media ’s going to challenge me , is going to want to bring me down .
But I feel like I ’m at such a place that I own myself , and it ’s authentic .
I own that authentic part of myself , and none of those words are harsh enough to make me believe them . ”
She then said , “ I ca n’t imagine saying some of the things people have said about me about anybody else . ”
In the end , sitting with Jessica Simpson , you felt that here was a talented , decent , beautiful person who had reached a dead end in the trail she had been following since she was a girl in Texas , too young , really , to decide much of anything .
To understand her current condition you must therefore understand the trail , the path she has followed — her story , her biography — for everything she has done and been led to this moment .
Simpson ’s father ( Joe ) and mother ( Tina ) married young — 20 , 18 .
He was a Baptist minister , one of those regular Elmer Gantry types .
Some of Jessica ’s first memories are of sitting in the pews , listening to Joe Simpson preach .
“ He was amazing , ” she told me .
“ If I ’m going for advice for anything in my life , I go straight to my father because he has the answers . ”
Jessica was born in 1980 in Abilene , Texas .
Her sister was born four years later .
By the time Jessica was 10 , the family had moved at least a half - dozen times , the minister forever in search of a ministry .
It ’s a righteous calling , but a hard life .
Jessica began singing on the altar , sunlight beaming through high windows , her first songs dedicated to the only Father that matters .
Joe Simpson used to bring unwed mothers home to live , to counsel and feed , but also as a kind of visual warning to his daughters :
Here is what comes from yielding to temptation !
When Jessica was 12 , Joe gave her a purity ring , on which she pledged to keep her virginity until its taking could be ordained by God ( and aired on MTV ) .
How did Jessica decide that she wanted to be something more than a church singer , that she wanted to share her gift with the world ?
By holy epiphany .
One weekend when she was 11 years old , on a church retreat , the pastor spoke of special callings , of being alert enough to hear , courageous enough to answer .
After that , as the congregants were singing “ Amazing Grace , ” Jessica recognized the beauty of her own voice , as if for the first time , and the pastor seemed to hear it too , saying , There ’s somebody in this room who ’s going to use their voice to affect the world .
Whoever you are , come to the front .
After pushing through her fellow believers , Jessica stood beside the preacher , smiling because she knew .
Soon after , she went with her school dance class to open auditions being held in Dallas for the new Mickey Mouse Club , a nationwide , once - in - a - lifetime , get - famous - just - like - that search that began with 50,000 entrants .
She sang “ Amazing Grace ” without accompaniment and danced to “ Ice Ice Baby , ” which should tell you something about the era and about Simpson .
It was 1992 .
She made the cut , made the next cut and the cut after that , progressing as you progress from level to level in a video game , until she found herself in a studio in Orlando , Florida , with a dozen other finalists , what remained when the grade schools of America had been sifted and panned for gold .
If you wanted to change the course of history , you could send Schwarzenegger back to 1992 to destroy that studio , as on its stages were the next 20 years of tabloid culture : Timberlake , Spears , Aguilera , and Simpson in shrunken , Muppet - baby form .
Film adaptation of street tough Jim Carroll 's epistle about his kaleidoscopic free fall into the harrowing world of drug addiction .
As a member of a seemingly unbeatable high school basketball squad , Jim 's life centers around the basketball court and the court becomes a metaphor for the world in his mind .
A best friend who is dying of leukemia , a coach ( " Swifty " ) who takes unacceptable liberties with the boys on his team , teenage sexual angst , and an unhealthy appetite for heroin -- all of these begin to encroach on young Jim 's dream of becoming a basketball star .
Soon , the dark streets of New York become a refuge from his mother 's mounting concern for her son .
He can't go home and his only escape from the reality of the streets is heroin for which he steals , robs and prostitutes himself .
Only with the help of Reggie , an older neighborhood friend with whom Jim " picked up a game " now and then , is he able to begin the long journey back to sanity .

This week the final release of the Haskell Platform 2009.2.x series will take place .
The Haskell Platform is a single , standard Haskell distribution for every system , in the form of a blessed library and tool suite for Haskell distilled from the thousands of libraries on Hackage , along with installers for a wide variety of systems .
It saves developers work picking and choosing the best Haskell libraries and tools to use for a task .
When you install the Haskell Platform , you get the latest stable compiler , an expanded set of core libraries , additional development tools , and cabal - install – so you can download anything else you need from Hackage .
From the beginning our goal has been to have a comprehensive Haskell toolchain on every machine , making it dead easy to install Haskell applications and libraries .
We ’re doing our job if people are downloading the installers for Mac and Windows , and if the various Unix distros are supporting the platform specification .
So how are we going ?
Downloads
There have been 2 releases since May 2009 .
From the first few minutes of the release , downloads of the various windows installer were running at many times the rate as that for other platforms ( there had until now been no single Haskell package for Windows , after all ) .
This surprised us .
By the end of July 2009 , 90 days later , there had been :
114,790 downloads of the Windows installer ( !!)
downloads of the Windows installer ( !!)
2,790 installs of the generic unix source tarball ( complementing the packages provided on each distro ) .
On June 1 , the Mac OSX package went live , complementing the MacPorts GHC version .
1,300 installs of the Mac OSX package .
The Windows figure is pretty stunning — they really miss not having a package system I think .
Note also : these are total downloads of any of the multiple versions of the installers , not unique IPs .
Well done to Mikhail Glushenkov and Gregory Collins who have pretty much single handedly delivered the Windows and Mac installers .
Supported Distros
From the start , Gentoo , Nix and Arch Linux have supported the platform spec ,
The hot news at the moment is the Debian ( and thus , Ubuntu ) push :
The Debian Haskell team is making big strides in having packages adopted .
You can see the state of Hackage as supported by Debian here .
It is already becoming increasingly easy to obtain a full Haskell system – as the implementors intend – on a number of platforms .
If your distro is n’t providing support , name and shame them . :-)
What ’s new in 2009.2.0.2 ?
2009.2.0.2 will be released later this week .
It is the final bugfix release in the 2009.2.0.2 series .
It will contain :
GHC 6.10.4
network upgraded to 2.2.1.4
Improvements to the MacOSX installer
Significant improvements in Debian support for Haskell
What ’s next ?
Don and Duncan will be talking at the Haskell Implementors Workshop about the Platform , and how our world domination plans are unfolding .
The first released in the 2009.4.x series will appear in the next few months .
This will be the first release with an expanded set of packages nominated by the community .
Start thinking about what packages you need to get your work done .
.
Start thinking about what packages you need to get your work done .
GHC 6.12.x series will be released in a few months , relying soley on the platform bundle for library support .
There will be no “ extralibs ” , so distros need to start acting now to support the platform specification .
The Haskell Platform steering committee has been formed , to handle policy decisions , and the interface between the language teams , compiler teams and the library / platform community .
The Fedora Haskell Special Interest Group is making progress on platform adoption in Fedora land .
So all this is very exciting .
I think we ’re on track with our original goals for the platform , and hope to have further concrete results in time for ICFP 2009 , and the Haskell Implementors Workshop , marking 12 months since the original Batteries Included idea was proposed .
We ’re not there yet !
There are many ways you can help ensure Haskell works well everywhere :
Write new packages for Hackage , and release them
Volunteer time to maintain orphaned packages
Port packages to your distro of choice
Build binary installers for your system
Tell us what you need to use Haskell for your projects .
Contribute documentation
Test , test and tell us what goes wrong , and what goes right !
Help identify the best packages in each category .
Analyse them , compare them , and write about it .
In government , failure is success .
That ’s what I call DiLorenzo ’s First Law of Government .
When the welfare state bureaucracy fails to reduce poverty , it is rewarded with more tax dollars and more responsibilities .
When the government schools fail to educate children , they are rewarded with more tax dollars and more power to meddle in education .
When NASA blows up the space shuttle , it is rewarded with a large budget increase ( unlike a private airline , which would likely go bankrupt ) .
And when the Fed causes the worse depression since the Great Depression , it is rewarded with a vast expansion of its powers .
DiLorenzo ’s Second Law of Government is that politicians will never assume responsibility for any of the problems that they cause .
No one in society is more irresponsible than politicians , especially ones like President Obama who blame today ’s economic crisis on an alleged lack of responsibility in the private sector .
They will always blame capitalism for our economic problems , even when capitalism is not even the economic system that we live under ( it ’s economic fascism , to end the suspense ) .
Nothing is more irresponsible than knowingly destroying what ’s left of our engine of economic growth with more and more governmental central planning , even if it is given the laughable name of " public interest regulation . "
DiLorenzo’s
Third Law of Government is that , with one or two exceptions , all politicians are habitual liars .
The so - called " watchdog media " is a myth , for pointing out the lies of politicians is the best way to end one ’s career as a " prominent journalist . "
Do this , and your sources of governmental information will be shut off .
Today ’s Biggest Governmental
Lie is that financial markets are unregulated and in dire need of more direction , regulation , control , and in some cases , nationalization , by the Fed or by a new Super Regulatory Authority .
This is all a lie because , according to one of the Fed ’s own publications ( " The Federal Reserve System : Purposes and Functions " ) , the Fed already has " supervisory and regulatory authority " over : bank holding companies , state - chartered banks , foreign branches of member banks , edge and agreement corporations , U.S. state - licensed branches , agencies , and representative offices of foreign banks , nonbanking activities of foreign banks , national banks , savings banks , nonbank subsidiaries of bank holding companies , thrift holding companies , financial reporting procedures of banks , accounting policies of banks , business " continuity " in case of economic emergencies , consumer protection laws , securities dealings of banks , information technology used by banks , foreign investment by banks , foreign lending by banks , branch banking , bank mergers and acquisitions , who may own a bank , capital " adequacy standards , " extensions of credit for the purchase of securities , equal opportunity lending , mortgage disclosure information , reserve requirements , electronic funds transfers , interbank liabilities , Community Reinvestment
Act sub - prime lending demands , all international banking operations , consumer leasing , privacy of consumer financial information , payments on demand deposits , " fair credit " reporting , transactions between member banks and their affiliates , truth in lending , and truth in savings .
And of course it also engages in legal price fixing of interest rates and creates inflation and boom - and - bust cycles with its " open market operations . "
This is the Washington , D.C. establishment ’s definition of " laissez faire " in financial markets .
( Note that I did n’t even mention other financial market regulators such as the SEC , Comptroller of the Currency , Office of Thrift Supervision , and dozens of state regulatory agencies ) .
DiLorenzo ’s Fourth Law of Government is that politicians will only take the advice of their legions of academic advisors if it promises to increase their power , wealth , and influence , even if they know the advice is bad ( or even devastating ) for the rest of society .
The academics happily play along with this corrupt game because it also increases their notoriety and wealth .
The most glaring example of this phenomenon today is the fact that there has been virtually no discussion at all by government officials or the media of the vast literature of the gross failures of government regulation to protect " the public interest , " a literature that documents the failures of government regulation for more than a century .
The Triumph of Conserv ... Gabriel Kolko Best Price : $ 2.64 Buy New $ 11.46 ( as of 08:40 EST - Details )
There has always been some kind of government regulation of economic activity in America , but the regulatory state got its first big boost with an 1877 Supreme Court case known as Munn v. Illinois .
The two Munn brothers owned a grain storage business , and the powerful farm lobby in their state wanted to essentially steal some of their property from them by having the Illinois state legislature pass a price control law that forced the price of grain storage down below the free - market price .
Such laws had previously been ruled as an unconstitutional taking of private property or a violation of the Contract Clause of the Constitution , but no longer .
The plunder - seeking farmers prevailed , and it was hailed by the Court as a great victory for " public interest " regulation .
Thus , the first example of " public interest " regulation was unequivocally an act of legalized theft for the benefit of a powerful and unscrupulous political special - interest group at the expense of honest , hard - working small businessmen .
Either through ignorance or corruption ( or both ) , academics — including the founders of the American Economic Association , such as Richard T. Ely — sang the " public interest " tune with regard to economic regulation for decades , creating the popular myth that markets always fail , and government regulation is always benevolent , omniscient , and correcting .
They did this despite the glaring evidence all around them that regulation was always and everywhere a special - interest phenomenon .
As historian Gabriel Kolko wrote in his 1963 book , The Triumph of Conservatism , big business in the early 20th century sought government regulation because the regulation " was invariably controlled by leaders of the regulated industry , and directed toward ends they deemed acceptable or desirable . "
" Government regulation has generally served to further the very economic interests being regulated , " legal scholar Butler Shaffer wrote some thirty years later in his book , In Restraint of Trade .
Kolko called this " the new Hamiltonianism " and " a reincarnation of the Hamiltonian unity of politics and economics , " referring to the mercantilist aspirations of the nation ’s first treasury secretary .
Most academic economists , seduced by the prestige and money that came from being governmental advisors , ignored all of this reality and instead spent roughly fifty years — from the pre-World War I years until the 1960s — inventing factually empty theories about the alleged " failures " of markets and the need for benevolent and presumably omniscient government regulators to " correct " these alleged failures .
It was all based ( and still is ) on the quite fraudulent technique of proclaiming that markets are not " perfect , " but that government was , and would therefore correct any imperfections in real - world markets ( as though anything on this earth is " perfect " ) .
Economist Harold Demsetz mockingly labeled this approach to the study of markets " the Nirvana Fallacy . "
The Austrian School of Economics is the only school of thought within the economics profession that never participated in this corrupt charade .
The same cannot be said of the famous " Chicago School " whose acknowledged founder , Henry Simons , embraced many " market failure " theories and was an interventionist by any day ’s standards .
$ 26
But the Chicago School performed a penance of sorts beginning in the 1960s with research and publications about the actual effects of government regulation , including analyses of who benefits and who loses from it .
Unlike the rest of the economics profession ( with the exception of the Austrian School ) , they no longer simply accepted the unfounded assumption that government regulation was unequivocally a good thing .
Hundreds of books and thousands of academic journal articles were published that essentially rediscovered the old truth that " as a rule , regulation is acquired by the industry and is designed and operated primarily for its benefit , " as Nobel laureate George Stigler wrote in 1971 .
Stigler was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics for his research on " the economics of regulation . "
This research was expanded over the years to account for different kinds of regulation , such as regulation that is sought by one producer group that does not necessarily harm consumers but competing producers .
Large corporations often lobby for onerous government safety and environmental regulations , for example , because they know the regulations will likely bankrupt their smaller competitors and deter the entry of potential rivals .
In any event , there now exists a gigantic literature on the economic effects of regulation that shows that , for over 100 years , it has rarely , if ever , benefited consumers despite all the pro-consumer / public interest rhetoric that is attached to it .
All of this literature is studiously ignored by Ivy League " superstars " like Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke , the former chairman of the Princeton University economics department .
It is a shameless act of academic fraud , but unlike normal academic fraud , it will have tremendous negative real - world economic consequences .
A major thrust of this literature is the recognition that , historically , businesses that have tried to form cartels have always failed .
Even the infamous OPEC Cartel only had the power to raise world oil prices for about seven years during the 1970s before it collapsed .
Private attempts to cartelize or monopolize markets always fail because of the powerful temptation to cheat on the cartel agreement by cutting prices .
Once one member of the cartel cheats in this way , the whole thing breaks down as everyone else " cheats " while the cheating is good and there are still profits to be made .
Businesses long ago discovered that the only way to have a permanent or at least long - lasting cartel is to have the cartel agreement enforced by government regulation , with the threat of heavy fines and / or imprisonment for cheating .
Thus , the railroad and trucking industries were cartelized by the Interstate Commerce Commission , which set industry prices and was controlled for decades by those industries .
The Civil Aeronautics Board cartelized the airline industry in a similar way for about half a century until it was deregulated in the late 1970s .
There was vigorous competition and price cutting in the electric utility industry until it was ended by government regulation and the creation of franchise monopolies by government in most cities in America .
AT&T enjoyed a telephone industry monopoly thanks to state government regulation that made competition illegal for decades .
The list is almost endless .
Perhaps most importantly , the Fed was created to facilitate the creation of a banking industry cartel and the creation of cartel profits in that industry as well .
As Murray Rothbard wrote in A History of Money and Banking in the United States , " the financial elites of this country . . . were responsible for putting through the Federal Reserve System , as a governmentally created and sanctioned cartel device to enable the nation ’s banks to inflate the money supply . . . without suffering quick retribution from depositors or noteholders demanding cash . "
In other words , giving the Fed even more regulatory " authority " is like giving an alcoholic another bottle of whisky , a murderer another gun , or a bank robber another ski mask .
It is bound to make things worse , not better .
" We the people " have no ability to regulate the regulators in any way .
Our only hope is to end the Fed before it creates an even greater depression than the one it has created for us today .
The Best of Thomas DiLorenzo
Newly uncovered photographs of Nazi officials and SS officers relaxing away from their duties at the Auschwitz - Birkenau death camp in 1944 have gone on display online .
The 16 - page album , given to the US Holocaust Memorial Museum by a former US army officer who found it in Frankfurt in 1946 , belonged to an SS officer called Karl Hoecker .
Many of the 116 images were taken at an SS resort called Solahuette , just outside Auschwitz , where guards and officials were sent to unwind as a reward for " good work " .
Among those pictured socialising are notorious Auschwitz doctor Josef Mengele ( second left ) , who experimented on prisoners , and officers who ran the death camps .
On the same day Hoecker and SS women were snapped enjoying blueberries , records show 150 prisoners arrived at Auschwitz .
The SS selected 33 for work and gassed the rest .
Hoecker , who claimed he did not know about the mass killing of Jews at Auschwitz , is seen decorating a Christmas tree only weeks before Russia 's Red Army liberated the camp .
Historians say the images of SS officers enjoying themselves in their time off are not a surprise , given other documentary evidence - but are chilling nonetheless .
Holocaust survivors say they hope the album , while offensive , will remind viewers that the perpetrators of genocide are ordinary people , and act as a warning for future generations .

Jesus affirmed a gay couple .
Listen to a sermon on this topic :
The Greek word that the Roman centurion uses in this passage to describe the sick man – pais – is the same word used in ancient Greek to refer to a same - gender partner .

Discussion : Matthew 19:10 - 12
From our days in Sunday school , many of us are familiar with the Gospel story where Jesus healed the servant of a Roman centurion .
This story is recorded in Matthew 8:5-13 and Luke 7:1-10 .
In Matthew , we are told that the centurion came to Jesus to plead for the healing of his servant .
Jesus said he was willing to come to the centurion ’s house , but the centurion said there was no need for Jesus to do so — he believed that if Jesus simply spoke the word , his servant would be healed .
Marveling at the man ’s faith , Jesus pronounced the servant healed .
Luke tells a similar story .
Just another miracle story , right ?
Not on your life !
Note 18 .
K.J. Dover , Greek Homosexuality ( Harvard University Press , Cambridge , 1978 ) , page 16 ; Bernard Sergent , Homosexuality in Greek Myth ( Beacon Press , Boston , 1986 ) , page 10 .
In the original language , the importance of this story for gay , lesbian , and bisexual Christians is much clearer .
The Greek word used in Matthew ’s account to refer to the servant of the centurion is pais .
In the language of the time , pais had three possible meanings depending upon the context in which it was used .
It could mean “ son or boy ; ” it could mean “ servant , ” or it could mean a particular type of servant — one who was “ his master ’s male lover . ”
( See note 18 . )
Often these lovers were younger than their masters , even teenagers .
Note 19 .
Mercer Dictionary of the Bible ( Mercer University Press , Macon , 1994 ) , page 554 .
To our modern minds , the idea of buying a teen lover seems repugnant .
But we have to place this in the context of ancient cultural norms .
In ancient times , commercial transactions were the predominant means of forming relationships .
Under the law , the wife was viewed as the property of the husband , with a status just above that of slave .
Moreover , in Jesus ’ day , a boy or girl was considered of marriageable age upon reaching his or her early teens .
It was not uncommon for boys and girls to marry at age 14 or 15 .
( See note 19 . )
Nor was it uncommon for an older man to marry a young girl .
Fortunately civilization has advanced , but these were the norms in the culture of Jesus ’ day .
In that culture , if you were a gay man who wanted a male “ spouse , ” you achieved this , like your heterosexual counterparts , through a commercial transaction — purchasing someone to serve that purpose .
A servant purchased to serve this purpose was often called a pais .
The word boy in English offers a rough comparison .
Like pais , the word boy can be used to refer to a male child .
But in the slave South in the nineteenth century , boy was also often used to refer to male slaves .
The term boy can also be used as a term of endearment .
For example , Jeff ’s father often refers to his mother as “ his girl . ”
He does n’t mean that she is a child , but rather that she is his “ special one . ”
The term boy can be used in the same way , as in “ my boy ” or “ my beau . ”
In ancient Greek , pais had a similar range of meanings .
Thus , when this term was used , the listener had to consider the context of the statement to determine which meaning was intended .
Some modern Christians may be tempted to simply declare by fiat that the Gospels could not possibly have used the term pais in the sense of male lover , end of discussion .
But that would be yielding to prejudice .
We must let the word of God speak for itself , even if it leads us to an uncomfortable destination .
Is it possible the pais referred to in Matthew 8 and Luke 7 was the Roman centurion ’s male lover ?
Let ’s look at the biblical evidence .

For an excellent and thorough discussion of the terms pais and entimos doulos in these two gospel accounts , see Donald Mader ’s article The Entimos Pais of Matthew 8:5-13 and Luke 7:1-10 , ( Source : Homosexuality and Religion and Philosophy , Harland Publishing , Inc. , New York , 1998 ) .
The Bible provides three key pieces of textual and circumstantial evidence .
First , in the Luke passage , several additional Greek words are used to describe the one who is sick .
Luke says this pais was the centurion ’s entimos doulos .
The word doulos is a generic term for slave , and was never used in ancient Greek to describe a son / boy .
Thus ,
Luke ’s account rules out the possibility the sick person was the centurion ’s son ; his use of doulos makes clear this was a slave .
However , Luke also takes care to indicate this was no ordinary slave .
The word entimos means “ honored . ”
This was an “ honored slave ” ( entimos doulos ) who was his master ’s pais .
Taken together , the three Greek words preclude the possibility the sick person was either the centurion ’s son or an ordinary slave , leaving only one viable option — he was his master ’s male lover .
( See note 20 . )
A second piece of evidence is found in verse 9 of Matthew ’s account .
In the course of expressing his faith in Jesus ’ power to heal by simply speaking , the centurion says , “ When I tell my slave to do something , he does it . ”
By extension , the centurion concludes that Jesus is also able to issue a remote verbal command that must be carried out .
When speaking here of his slaves , the centurion uses the word doulos .
But when speaking of the one he is asking Jesus to heal , he uses only pais .
In other words , when he is quoted in Matthew , the centurion uses pais only when referring to the sick person .
He uses a different word , doulos , when speaking of his other slaves , as if to draw a distinction .
( In Luke , it is others , not the centurion , who call the sick one an entimos doulos . )
Again , the clear implication is that the sick man was no ordinary slave .
And when pais was used to describe a servant who was not an ordinary slave , it meant only one thing — a slave who was the master ’s male lover .
The third piece of evidence is circumstantial .
In the Gospels , we have many examples of people seeking healing for themselves or for family members .
But this story is the only example of someone seeking healing for a slave .
The actions described are made even more remarkable by the fact that this was a proud Roman centurion ( the conqueror / oppressor ) who was humbling himself and pleading with a Jewish rabbi ( the conquered / oppressed ) to heal his slave .
The extraordinary lengths to which this man went to seek healing for his slave is much more understandable , from a psychological perspective , if the slave was his beloved companion .
Thus , all the textual and circumstantial evidence in the Gospels points in one direction .
For objective observers , the conclusion is inescapable :
In this story Jesus healed a man ’s male lover .
When understood this way , the story takes on a whole new dimension .
Imagine how it may have happened .
While stationed in Palestine , the centurion ’s pais becomes ill — experiencing some type of life - threatening paralysis .
The centurion will stop at nothing to save him .
Perhaps a friend tells him of rumors of Jesus ’ healing powers .
Perhaps this friend also tells him Jesus is unusually open to foreigners , teaching his followers that they should love their enemies , even Roman soldiers .
So the centurion decides to take a chance .
Jesus was his only hope .
As he made his way to Jesus , he probably worried about the possibility that Jesus , like other Jewish rabbis , would take a dim view of his homosexual relationship .
Perhaps he even considered lying .
He could simply use the word duolos .
That would have been accurate , as far as it went .
But the centurion probably figured if Jesus was powerful enough to heal his lover , he was also powerful enough to see through any half - truths .
So the centurion approaches Jesus and bows before him .
“ Rabbi , my . . . , ” the word gets caught in his throat .
This is it — the moment of truth .
Either Jesus will turn away in disgust , or something wonderful will happen .
So , the centurion clears his throat and speaks again .
“ Rabbi , my pais — yes , my pais lies at home sick unto death . ”
Then he pauses and waits for a second that must have seemed like an eternity .
The crowd of good , God-fearing people surrounding Jesus probably became tense .
This was like a gay man asking a televangelist to heal his lover .
What would Jesus do ?
Without hesitation , Jesus says , “ Then I will come and heal him . ”
It ’s that simple !
Jesus did n’t say , “ Are you kidding ?
I ’m not going to heal your pais so you can go on living in sin ! ”
Nor did he say , “ Well , it should n’t surprise you that your pais is sick ; this is God ’s judgment on your relationship . ”
Instead , Jesus ’ words are simple , clear , and liberating for all who have worried about what God thinks of gay relationships .
“ I will come and heal him . ”
At this point , the centurion says there is no need for Jesus to travel to his home .
He has faith that Jesus ’ word is sufficient .
Jesus then turns to the good people standing around him — those who were already dumbfounded that he was willing to heal this man ’s male lover .
To them , Jesus says in verse 10 of Matthew ’s account , “ I have not found faith this great anywhere in Israel . ”
In other words , Jesus holds up this gay centurion as an example of the type of faith others should aspire to .
Jesus did n’t just tolerate this gay centurion .
He said he was an example of faith — someone we all should strive to be like .
Then , just so the good , God-fearing people would n’t miss his point , Jesus speaks again in verse 11 : “ I tell you , many will come from the east and the west [ i.e. , beyond the borders of Israel ] to find a seat in the kingdom of heaven , while the heirs [ i.e. , those considered likely to inherit heaven ] will be thrown into outer darkness . ”
By this statement Jesus affirmed that many others like this gay centurion — those who come from beyond the assumed boundaries of God ’s grace — are going to be admitted to the kingdom of heaven .
And he also warned that many who think themselves the most likely to be admitted will be left out .
In this story , Jesus restores a gay relationship by a miracle of healing and then holds up a gay man as an example of faith for all to follow .
So consider carefully : Who is Lord — Jesus or cultural prejudice ?
The oldest funeral in the Balkans is a matter of research by Dutch anthropologists .

A team of Dutch anthropologists has arrived to the Bulgarian village of Dzhulyunitsa to research the Neolithic archaeological site there .
The object of their research will be oldest funeral in the Balkans - a funeral of a person at the age of 12 - 13 , which dates back to 6300 - 6150 BC .
The early Neolithic funeral was discovered in 2004 by Nedko Elenski , an archaeologist at the Regional History Museum of the nearby city of Veliko Tarnovo .
The anthropologists from the Netherlands are taking samples from the bones of the buried child in order to conduct further research .
They are going to use DNA analysis in order to reveal more information about the people who lived in central northern Bulgaria some 8000 years ago .
The Neolithic settlement at Dzhulyunitsa existed between 6300 and 5700 BC .
The causes of its demise are still known , according to Elenski .
Two other graves dating back to 4000 BC have also been discovered nearby .
In 2005 , Nedko Elenski also discovered pieces of 8000 year - old corroded metal , which turned out to be copper .
These finds have been sent to Germany in order to establish whether the metal had been worked up by humans .
Another interesting fact about the contemporary village of Dzhulyunitsa is that it is the home place of Bulgarian sumo wrestler Kaloyan Mahlyanov - Kotooshu .
Present day Dorchester lays claim to being the biggest part of Boston , in terms of land mass and population .
But , big as it is today , Dorchester was once much , much larger .
At its height , the town of Dorchester nearly reached the Rhode Island border .
It included parts of present day South Boston , Hyde Park , Roxbury , Foxboro , Dedham , Wrentham , Canton , Sharon , Raynham , Mattapan , Quincy , and the entire towns of Milton and Stoughton .
What if Dorchester had maintained those historical borders ?
What if Dorchester had , as one resident from the Boston annexation period was recorded saying by William Dana Orcutt in his book , Good Old Dorchester , â€œa few feet more depth of water along the ten miles of shore which formed her sea boundary ?â€ 
Would we be living in the City of Dorchester , with Boston as one of our neighborhoods ?
Earl Taylor , President of the Dorchester Historical Society and a resident of Ashmont Hill notes â€ œIâ€™m not sure itâ€™s a desirable state of being to be separate from Boston .
I doubt that we have the taxpaying infrastructure .
We donâ€™t have huge businesses , the downtown [ area ] has a lot of big commercial property , whereas Dorchester is nearly all residential.â€ 
A City of Dorchester would thus require a greater involvement amongst Dorchester residents .
â€
œAll the human resources that are there would make it work if it could , I just donâ€™t know if the monetary resources are thereâ€ to support the public services Dorchester would lose from the City of Boston .
Kevaughn Arthur , 27 , of Grove Hall , agrees with Taylor .
â€ œItâ€™s great to have Dot pride , but it takes a lot more than that to be a successful city .
I donâ€™t believe it would succeed unless there was already a full infrastructure in place , which there really isnâ€™t.â€ 
Carla Poles , 24 , of Neponset believes such a city â€œwould succeed .â€ 
â€ œThe intrinsic diversity of Dorchester provides the cultural and intellectual wealth necessary for success in the maintenance of a city , â€  Poles said , although , for the record , much of Dorchesterâ€™s diverse population settled here after the annexation into Boston .
But , if Dorchester had a viable harbor , many of these immigrants might have settled in Dorchester rather than Boston proper .
As the populace grew , bits of Dorchester segued off to become their own towns .
Once the City of Boston claimed South Boston and later annexed Roxbury , it became clear to the residents of Dorchester that annexation of their town would be next on the agenda of the governments of Boston and Massachusetts .
Dorchester annexationists promoted a union with Boston and on June 22 , 1869 â€ ” in a vote held on the site of what is now the Great Hall in Codman Square â€” approved an annexation into Boston by a vote of 928 to 726 .
The next year , Dorchester ceased to exist as an independent town and became the biggest part of the City of Boston .
By the 20th century , the neighborhood accounted for 20 percent of the population of Boston .
Over the past few years , Dorchester has experienced a revival with new construction occurring all over the neighborhood and up scale restaurants and shops opening up in nearly every area .
Young professionals have flocked to Dorchester thanks to below average rent and home prices , compared to the general Boston area .
In 2007 , Business Week named Dorchester one of Americaâ€™s â€ œNext Hot Neighborhoodsâ€ .
Vincent Baker , 46 , and Louis Baker , 51 , brothers from Savin Hill , exemplify the local business owners that have cropped up in Dorchester over the past decade .
The Bakers own the Domestic Boot shop on Dorchester Avenue and are proud lifelong residents of Dorchester .
Vincent thinks a City of Dorchester â€ œis not doable right now .
The infrastructure is in place already for the whole city .
Creating a new city would be a logistical nightmare.â€ 
Louis countered that the new city could save by â€ œnot paying for school buses and sending kids to local neighborhood schools within walking distance .â€ 
Even with any savings the new city might realize , Vincent strongly emphasized â€œwe would need more local businesses .
It would happen on its own and tax incentives would encourage new businesses.â€ 
The gentrification Dorchester is experiencing today is something supporters of the Mandela Initiative , a movement by Roxbury activists to form a new city composed of Roxbury , Mattapan , and parts of Dorchester , the South End , Jamaica Plain and the Fenway , sought to avoid .
The City of Mandela would have cordoned off roughly a quarter of Bostonâ€™s land mass and population into a new 12.5 square mile city of approximately 150,000 residents .
The Mandela Initiative was voted down on a 1986 state ballot and once again on a 1988 city ballot .
The mayorâ€™s office stated that the proposed city would likely face immediate bankruptcy .
The loss of tax revenues from commercial properties in the downtown area would have left a shortfall of $ 100 - 135 million , according to the Mayor Flynnâ€™s administration .
A smaller secession measure in South Boston was likewise rejected by the voters in 1992 .
Even with the influx of new businesses and residents , Dorchester would likely face a similar budget shortfall if it chose to secede today .
Dot pride and the working class ethic would be its two biggest assets .
But these assets would not be enough , according to Corrine Tobias , 24 of Clam Point .
â€ œDot Pride is great , but it doesnâ€™t bring in the tax dollars necessary to run the neighborhood , the roads are already bad enough , â€ she argues .
Since 1904 , on the first Sunday of June , Dorchester residents have joined together to celebrate the creation of Dorchester in 1630 .
Dot pride is on display in full force during the annual parade that travels across the entire neighborhood , from Lower Mills right to the edge of the Polish Triangle .
That pride is expressed daily too .
From
Dot stickers to bloggers touting the diversity and energy of Dot to the lifelong inhabitants who could have moved to greener pastures but decided the grass is plenty green right here .
Already home of the first free public school in the USA , the first community health center , the first settlement in Suffolk County , and the first government run by town hall meetings , could Dorchester become the first neighborhood to successfully secede from the City of Boston ?
Some of the men who initially pushed annexation back in the 19th century would surely oppose such a move .
A pamphlet written by N.W. Coffin counseled : â€ œAnd by annexation we shall avoid a great evil - the possibility of a city organization of our own , to be delivered from which every good citizen should constantly pray.â€ 
Even then , the Dorchester annexation supporters knew that the management of a city would require far more resources than Dorchester possessed .
Stephanie Simpson - White , 24 , of Adams Street , agrees with the sentiment .
â€ œFrankly I would love to see the people of my city spend their time and effort on fixing the problems we have instead of worrying about whether to become a separate entity or not .
The quality of living in Dorchester has been on the rise for the past few years .
What would happen to that progress if we lost support from the City of Boston ?â€ 
Roseanne Foley of Codman Square adds : â€ œWithout a few more university juggernauts , and with most of our fertile agricultural land now covered by development , itâ€™d be tough to find a successful niche in which to succeed on our own , although maybe the â€œgreenâ€ economy might be our ticket.â€ 
Andrew Binns , 25 , of Uphamâ€™s Corner provides perhaps the most compelling argument against an independent Dorchester .
â€ œI love being from Dorchester , but I also love being from Boston .
Growing up in Dorchester and Boston has given me exposure to a hugely diverse world .
Seceding from the City of Boston would harm that exposure as Dorchester would become cut off from the rest of the city.â€ 

Alvin Sargent is one of the most well - respected screenwriters in Hollywood .
He ’s the brother of Herb Sargent who up until his death in 2005 was president of the WGA , East and is married to long - time Hwood producer Laura Ziskin .
One look at his screenwriting credits — Paper Moon ( 1973 ) , Julia ( 1977 ) , Ordinary People ( 1980 ) , Nuts ( 1987 ) , Spiderman 2 ( 2004 ) , and Spiderman 3 ( 2007 ) , among many more — and you know you are dealing with a top - flight professional .
When I first broke into screenwriting as a profession in 1987 , I read everything I could on every screenwriter — and to this day , some of the best ‘ advice ’
I took in during that time was from Alvin Sargent .
Beyond everything else , Sargent challenges writers to leap before they look , take risks , get messy .
That , he insists , is how we find the magic in our characters and stories .
And so , here are some choice quotes from Alvin Sargent , gathered from books and articles over the years .
ON STRUCTURE
“ I do a great deal of free - associating .
Talk , for pages and pages , I do n’t know what ’s going on .
Then I find something alive — I hope .
I think too many people are too organized ; they ’ve got it all worked out , instead of hearing their characters first .
Get the goop out first , then organize . ”
ON CHARACTERS
“ Over a period of time , I begin to understand them , to think about them not only in terms of where they are in the story .
I think about where these people are today , even when I ’m not writing .
Sometimes they never come back , and so sometimes I fire them . ”
ON SPONTANEITY
“ Rigidity is the mother of rigidity .
It ’s very exciting to be ridiculous .
I wish I could be even more so than I am .
Jump !
Jumping is a lifeline , not the suicide or the predictable .
It brings you to life .
Take the character and put him where he least wants to be .
If it ’s honest , it ’ll be worth exploring . ”
ON THE WRITING PROCESS
“ My confidence grows or dissolves with each day ’s work .
As I work and start to see ‘ it ’ happening and realize that I ’m moving somewhere , that there ’s some kind of real life , then it ’s a good day .
“ But when it does n’t seem to be working for a long time , or you just ca n’t find the truth , then the terror sets in .
You must not stop .
You can not give in to anxiety .
Maintain energy .
Drive .
Rage .
Whatever it takes to keep writing .
“ Even though you ca n’t immediately solve problems , that does n’t mean the work is n’t alive .
You go back .
Back to the beginning .
The process is to move into it , come up to it , step by step , find out where you ’ve hit it wrong , what ’s dishonest .
Where you ’ve gone wrong usually involves a matter of honesty .
You ’ve been dishonest either to the character or to the structure of the piece . ”
ON FREEING YOURSELF TO WRITE
“ You must write everyday .
Free yourself .
Free association .
An hour alone a day .
Blind writing .
Write in the dark .
Do n’t think about what it is you ’re writing .
Just put a piece of paper in the typewriter , take your clothes off and go !
No destination … pay it no attention … it ’s pure unconscious exercise .
Pages of it .
Keep it up until embarrassment disappears .
Eliminate resistance .
Look at it in the morning .
Amazing sometimes .
Most of it wo n’t make any sense .
But there ’ll always be a small kernel of truth that relates to what you ’re working on at the time .
You wo n’t even know you created it .
It will appear , and it is yours .
Pure gold , a product of that pure part of you that does not know how to resist . ”
UPDATE : I seem to remember reading something where Sargent was talking about writer ’s block or when you feel stale as a writer , suggesting that you in essence ‘ rattle the cage , ’ change your work habits , do the opposite of what you normally do when you write .
The one specific piece of advice I recall is him saying that you should try writing the very moment you wake up .
Do n’t brush your teeth , do n’t go to the bathroom , do n’t eat anything , just stumble to your work space , and start typing .
The idea , I think , is that you can use physical discomfort to jolt your creativity .

On Tuesday , Google removed the " beta " tag of four high - profile Web properties , including Gmail , which had languished in beta form for over five years .
On Tuesday , Google removed the " beta " tag of four high - profile Web properties , including Gmail , which had languished in beta form for over five years .
Gmail , Google Calendar , Google Docs , and Google Talk are all now official products , Matt Glotzbach , director of product management for Google Enterprise , said in an interview .
Google also announced that Fairchild Semiconductor is the latest high - profile business to switch over to Google Apps , bringing its 5,500 employees over from the Lotus Notes platform , Glotzbach said .
In some ways , removing the beta tag from Gmail is something akin to an apocalyptic prophecy coming true .
In April 2004 , Google launched the first beta of Gmail , with a then - unheard - of gigabyte limit on the number of messages that could be stored online .
( The service launched to the public in Feb. 2007 . )
By comparison , Facebook launched two months earlier in Feb. 2004 , and then expanded worldwide as a finished product in Sept. 2006 .
But why Google kept all four products under the " beta " label remains something of a mystery .
When asked , Glotzbach referred to " inconsistencies " across the various product teams in terms of determining milestones .
" We 're looking to address those , " he said .
Glotzbach declined to go into specifics about what defined a beta product and what defined a " real " product , what if any milestones the company used , or the timeframe that a Google product could be expected to remain in beta .
" Candidly , the criteria varies , " Glotzbach said .
" We have n't historically had a single consistent set of criteria .
Individual teams have defined what is beta and out of beta .
It 's something that we 're fixing . "
However , Glotzbach did indicate that the " beta " tag was a turnoff for many businesses .
" Make no bones about it , the concern has definitely been voiced , " he said .
Some went ahead and adopted Google Apps , Glotzbach said .
" Others said ' We do n't like what beta represents , " he added .
" There was a sort of emotional barrier for enterprise adoption . "
To date , 1.75 million businesses have adopted Google Apps , most of them small - and medium - business customers , Glotzbach said .
Google Apps Premier Edition launched in February 2007 , and includes Gmail , Google Calendar , Google Docs , Google Video and Google Sites .
It costs $ 50 per user , per year .
Perks include a guranteed 99.9 percent uptime and 25 Gbytes of storage , versus 7.3 Gbytes or so for users of the free service .
Earlier this month , Google announced a tool to , while considering .
As of tomorrow , business users will also receive three additional benefits , a Google spokeswoman said , which are n't specifically tied to the removal from beta .
First , Google will use what it calls " active - active replication , " serving a live copy of the Apps data out of two separate data centers .
If one goes down , the live data will continue streaming out of the other with no interruption .
Second , Premier users will be able to delegate other people in a business , such as a co-worker or assistant , to access their email account and send messages on their behalf .
Finally , admins will be able to set a policy that allows old email to be deleted after a set number of days .
Glotzbach did not offer any additional insights into Google Wave , which but has disappeared since then .
Developers have been allowed to play in the Google Wave " sandbox " , but he could not give a timeframe on when a beta version might be released .
Glotzbach also could not say whether Wave would replace Gmail or Google Docs , as had been speculated .
" It 's way too early to tell , " he said of a possible replacement strategy .
POPE Benedict XVI is not entirely welcome here in the wake of the damning Ryan report , a survey found .
More than half of people surveyed do not want a second papal visit following the revelations in the report on child abuse .
An online survey by radio station Newstalk , in which 1,108 people took part , shows the scenes that greeted the late Pope John Paul II during the first papal visit 30 years ago are unlikely to be recreated .
Back in September 1979 , schools and businesses shut as thousands of Catholics flocked to the Phoenix Park during the three - day tour of Ireland .
However , despite strong feeling about a papal visit , the survey showed that the Ryan report has had little impact on the public 's religious practices .
Just 4 pc said the report had changed their Mass - going habits .
In addition , 68 pc of people said religious teaching in schools should not include details of clerical abuse .
Historic
There has been speculation that the Pope might come to Ireland this year to mark the 30th anniversary of the historic 1979 visit , but 52 pc of the 1,108 surveyed between June 22 and June 25 said he should stay away .
Many interviewees in the internet poll felt he should apologise before a visit could take place , while others said that saying sorry would not make any difference .
" Until he condemns what happened and pays compensation for his vile colleagues ' actions , and helps this country prosecute them by handing over all documents in relation to abuse issues and the movement of priests , then he should n't be allowed set foot in this country , " said one of the interviewees .
Another person said a visit might be an important gesture to reach out to the abused , but only if the perpetrators faced their guilt .
Another said they had difficulty taking any authority from the Pope .
" I did not elect him ; he is old , lives a sheltered life and does not have to worry about where his next meal is coming from , " he said .
" I am not sure what he can do now to ease the victims ' suffering .
The church is churning out ' mea culpas ' .
I am not sure how his sorry would be any better . "
Nanotechnology refers to controlling matter at an atomic or molecular scale measured in nanometers , or millionths of millimeters .
In the food industry , the technology has excited manufacturers as its potential uses are explored , including detecting bacteria in packaging , or producing stronger flavors and colorings .
But Dr Burdock claims that manufacturers lack understanding about how particles can change when they are shrunk to nano - size , and the current economic situation has exacerbated potential dangers , as some cost - cutting companies could look to cheaper , less reliable safety assessments .
Altered properties ​
One of the major safety worries about nanotechnology has been the suggestion that such small particles could feasibly cross cellular membrane barriers , meaning that an ingredient that is currently GRAS ( generally recognized as safe ) could become dangerous if it is nano - sized – a worry that Dr Burdock shares .
He told FoodNavigator - USA.com : “ The problem is that a lot of food ingredient manufacturers are looking at ingredients and saying that a product is GRAS , but if it ’s nano - sized it ’s going to have different properties . ​
“ The answer is that if you nano - size the particle you have to test it like a new substance .
This is what could make nanotechnology the new asbestos . ” ​
His views were echoed in a new report from the Investor Environmental Health Network ( IEHN ) released on Tuesday which discusses what it terms “ disturbing asbestos -nanotech parallels ” . ​
According to the report , “ some of these technologies are showing signs of posing serious hazards to human health and the environment , including the same kind of grave threats resulting from exposure to asbestos . ” ​
FDA testing ​
However , Dr Burdock agreed with the FDA ’s view that it already has the tools it needs to test the technology ’s safety , saying : “ Even though a nanotech particle takes on different properties you can still test its safety with standardized testing . ” ​
But problems could arise , he said , because – unlike genetic engineering – nanotechnology is “ very cheap to get into ” , ​ a situation that further opens up the potential for unethical practices , such as not testing a newly nano - sized ingredient .
“ Manufacturers have a moral and ethical responsibility to test .
Eighty percent of people play by the rules but you still have the bottom feeders , ” ​ he said .
For those manufacturers that do choose to explore the uses of nanotechnology , Dr Burdock said : “ Once food manufacturers get something approved their job is n’t over .
They have got to be very proactive …
New data is being developed all the time and when it is , they need to make sure the person checking their product knows what they are doing . ” ​
Game creator Jonathan
Blow became an overnight celebrity with the success of Braid , a game that he created from scratch with the help of artist David Hellman .
It became a huge hit on Xbox Live , and was subsequently released on Mac and PC platforms as well .
But it looks as if Xbox 360 wo n’t be the only game console to support Jonathan Blow ’s incredible vision .
The German ratings board , USK , have posted official information on Braid for PS3 .
Here is what the listing looks like .
In case you ’re wondering , HotHead Games are the same developers who ported Braid onto the Mac platform .
Are you guys as excited as we are ?

Google Inc has established a $ 100 million venture fund to invest in start - up , but full of potential Internet firms , which need early stage funding to develop their business .
Google Ventures will wholly belong to the Cupertino company and will actually look for firms through which Google will increase its revenue in this hard times .
Rich Miner and Bill Maris will manage the fund , and as Miner said , Google Ventures is looking for probably all kinds of companies including information technology , health care and biotech , etc . .
“ Just as we were founded by entrepreneurs , we think we can help some of those next entrepreneurs with the next great idea , ” said Miner .
Pixazza Inc , an photo - based online service and Silver Spring Networks are among those companies , which already had already got investments from Google Ventures .
Google Ventures investments will rang from tens of thousands to “ several tens of millions ” of dollars according to its managers .
A new study published by University of Leicester researchers has found " convincing evidence " that cannabis smoke damages DNA in ways that could potentially increase the risk of cancer development in humans .
Using a newly developed highly sensitive liquid chromatography - tandem mass spectrometry method , the University of Leicester scientists found clear indication that cannabis smoke damages DNA , under laboratory conditions .
They have now published the findings in the journal Chemical Research in Toxicology .
The research was carried out by Rajinder Singh , Jatinderpal Sandhu , Balvinder Kaur , Tina Juren , William P. Steward , Dan Segerback and Peter B. Farmer from the Cancer Biomarkers and Prevention Group , Department of Cancer Studies and Molecular Medicine and Karolinska Institute , Sweden .
Raj Singh said : " Parts of the plant Cannabis sativa , also known as marijuana , ganja , and various street names , are commonly smoked as a recreational drug , although its use for such purposes is illegal in many countries .
" There have been many studies on the toxicity of tobacco smoke .
It is known that tobacco smoke contains 4000 chemicals of which 60 are classed as carcinogens .
Cannabis in contrast has not been so well studied .
It is less combustible than tobacco and is often mixed with tobacco in use .
Cannabis smoke contains 400 compounds including 60 cannabinoids .
However , because of its lower combustibility it contains 50 % more carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons including naphthalene , benzanthracene , and benzopyrene , than tobacco smoke . "
Writing in the journal Chemical Research in Toxicology , the scientists describe the development of a mass spectrometry method that provides a clear indication that cannabis smoke damages DNA , under laboratory conditions .
The authors added : " It is well known that toxic substances in tobacco smoke can damage DNA and increase the risk of lung and other cancers .
Scientists were unsure though whether cannabis smoke would have the same effect .
Our research has focused on the toxicity of acetaldehyde , which is present in both tobacco and cannabis . "
The researchers add that the ability of cannabis smoke to damage DNA has significant human health implications especially as users tend to inhale more deeply than cigarette smokers , which increases respiratory burden .
" The smoking of 3 - 4 cannabis cigarettes a day is associated with the same degree of damage to bronchial mucus membranes as 20 or more tobacco cigarettes a day , " the team adds .
" These results provide evidence for the DNA damaging potential of cannabis smoke , " the researchers conclude , " implying that the consumption of cannabis cigarettes may be detrimental to human health with the possibility to initiate cancer development . "
The study was funded by the European Union Network of Excellence ECNIS , the Medical Research Council and Cancer Research UK .

She spoke to him briefly last night when he called from a camp set up on Mt Everest .
" I 'm at Camp 4 .
I made it .
I did it , " he told her before the line went dead .
She said Inglis had always dreamed of reaching the summit .
" It 's just something that he 's always had at the back of his mind and something that he thought he could always achieve . "
Sir Edmund Hillary told smh.com .au he was very impressed by Inglis 's achievement .
" ' Quite obviously a remarkable effort to actually climb Mt Everest with a couple of artificial legs .
And I have to admit that I admire his considerable effort ... he 's done a pretty good job , " said the 86 - year - old , who together with Tenzing Norgay , reached the summit 52 years ago .
Matthew Faid , a friend of Inglis and sponsor of his expedition , said the climber was " an awesome guy .
He puts you to shame .
He humbles you to be a human .
" It 's just amazing what he does .
He does n't have an attitude that says ' Why not ? '
He says , ' How ? " '
Inglis had set out in his bid on his prosthetic legs with an early morning start in perfect weather from Camp 4 - within 450 metres of the summit , Anne Inglis said earlier from her home on South Island .
Mount Everest is 8,850 metres high and Inglis has spent a gruelling 40 days on the mountain .
The original expedition party split into two groups with four members of the first group reaching the top earlier in the day , Anne Inglis said .
Inglis and his group of 20 , including Sherpa guides , were in the second party .
The climber had both legs severed just below the knees after suffering frostbite in 1982 when he was trapped by storms climbing New Zealand 's highest peak , Mount Cook .
Inglis was a mountain guide when he and climbing companion Phil Doole were found barely alive two weeks after they were forced into an ice cave high on Mount Cook by storm and blizzard conditions .
A wine maker and father of three , Inglis climbed 8,201 - metre Mount Cho Oyu in Tibet in 2004 .
His prosthetic legs had been no trouble on the climb , his wife said , despite one of the carbon - fibre prosthetic limbs snapping in a fall at an altitude of about 6,400 metres .
It was repaired with spare equipment .
The expedition is expected to raise several hundred thousand dollars for a Cambodian centre that provides rehabilitation for landmine amputees , polio victims and other disabled people .

Physicists at the National Institute of Standards and Technology ( NIST ) have demonstrated entanglement — a phenomenon peculiar to the atomic - scale quantum world — in a mechanical system similar to those in the macroscopic everyday world .
The work extends the boundaries of the arena where quantum behavior can be observed and shows how laboratory technology might be scaled up to build a functional quantum computer .
The research , described in the June 4 issue of Nature , involves a bizarre intertwining between two pairs of vibrating ions ( charged atoms ) such that the pairs vibrate in unison , even when separated in space .
Each pair of ions behaves like two balls connected by a spring ( see figure ) , vibrating back and forth in opposite directions .
Familiar objects that vibrate this way include pendulums and violin strings .
The NIST achievement provides insights into where and how " classical " objects may exhibit unusual quantum behavior .
The demonstration also showcased techniques that will help scale up trapped-ion technology to potentially build ultra-powerful computers relying on the rules of quantum physics .
If they can be built , quantum computers may be able to solve certain problems , such as code breaking , exponentially faster than today 's computers .
( For further details , see : http://www.nist.gov/public_affairs/quantum/quantum_info_index.html.)
" Where the boundary is between the quantum and classical worlds , no one really knows , " says NIST guest researcher John Jost , a graduate student at the University of Colorado at Boulder and first author of the paper .
" Maybe we can help answer the question by finding out what types of things can — and cannot be —entangled .
We 've entangled something that has never been entangled before , and it's the kind of physical , oscillating system you see in the classical world , just much smaller . "
Mechanical oscillators like two pendulum - based clocks have previously been synchronized , but their vibrations can still be independent , so that changes in one have no effect on the other .
Quantum entanglement — " spooky action at a distance , " in Einstein 's words — is a far more counterintuitive process :
If two objects are entangled , then manipulating one instantaneously affects the other , no matter how far away it is .
Entangled objects do not necessarily have identical properties , just properties that are linked in predictable ways .
Jost and colleagues entangled the vibrational motions of two separated mechanical oscillators , each consisting of one beryllium and one magnesium ion .
Each pair behaves like two objects connected by a spring 4 micrometers ( millionths of a meter ) long , with the beryllium and magnesium moving back and forth in opposite directions , first toward each other , then away , then back again .
The two pairs perform this motion in unison , even though they are 240 micrometers apart and are located in different zones of an ion trap .
The scientists created the desired entangled state at least 57 percent of the time they tried , and have identified ways to improve the success rate .

The NIST experiments suggest that mechanical oscillators can take part in both the quantum and classical worlds , possessing some features of each , depending in part on the energy and other properties of the vibrations .
The experiments also achieved the first combined demonstration of arranging different ions into a desired order , separating and re-cooling them while preserving entanglement , and then performing subsequent quantum operations on the ions .
These techniques could help scientists build large - scale quantum computers that use hundreds of ions to store data and perform many computational steps .
The same NIST group has previously demonstrated the basic building blocks of a quantum computer using ion traps , as well as rudimentary logic operations .
To entangle the motion of the two oscillators , the NIST group first placed four ions together in one trap zone in a particular linear order ( Be - Mg - Mg - Be ) , and entangled the internal energy states of the two beryllium ions .
The team then separated the four ions into two pairs , with each pair containing one of the entangled ions .
Finally , the scientists transferred the entanglement from the beryllium ions ' internal states to the oscillating motions of the separated ion pairs .
The research was funded in part by the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity .
The authors include former NIST post - doctoral scholars who are currently at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel and Lockheed Martin of Littleton , Colo .
How NIST Entangled Two Mechanical Oscillators
NIST physicists entangled two vibrating mechanical systems each consisting of one beryllium and one magnesium ion , in an experiment that required 14 milliseconds , including verification of results , and involved about 600 laser pulses .
The steps below expand on information provided in the figure .

Step 1 — Initially , all four ions are placed in the same zone of an ion trap and cooled with lasers to very low temperatures .
By tuning the voltages of the trap electrodes scientists arrange the ions in a particular order , with both heavier magnesium ions between the beryllium ions .
Using a technique developed for quantum computing several years ago , scientists entangle the two beryllium ions ' internal " spin states , " which are analogous to tiny bar magnets pointing up or down .
Two ultraviolet laser beams , positioned at right angles , cause the ions to oscillate .
The lasers are tuned so the difference between their frequencies is very close to the frequency of one of the ions ' natural vibrations , the rate at which it likes to oscillate back and forth .
Based on differences in their spins , the ions " feel " a differing laser force that causes the ions to oscillate in a particular way .
This coupling of the spin states to motion has the global effect of entangling the spins of the beryllium ions in a controlled way .
Step 2 — Voltages are then applied to electrode X to separate the ions into two pairs , which are distributed to different trap zones located adjacent to electrodes A and B .
The separation and transport boost the energy of motion in the oscillating ions .
Step 3 — The magnesium ions are cooled with lasers to remove excess motional energy from the beryllium ions , a process called sympathetic cooling because one type of ion cools the other .
This is the first time entangled ions have been re-cooled prior to further operations , a technique expected to be useful in computing .
Step 4 — By manipulating laser beam colors and orientations in a sequence of pulses of specific intensity and duration , scientists transfer the entanglement from the beryllium spins to the motion .
The two mechanical oscillators are now entangled .
Under ideal conditions , the beryllium and magnesium ions are oscillating back and forth in opposite directions , toward each other and then away .
The two pairs perform this motion in unison , even though they are 240 micrometers apart and are located in different zones of the trap .
Scientists are not able to measure the entangled motions directly .
Instead , to verify the results , they conduct a cleanup procedure partway through the experiment to ensure the entanglement has been transferred successfully from the ions ' spin to their mechanical motion .
Then , at the end of the experiment , they essentially reverse the entire process to transfer the entanglement from the ion motion back to the spins , to reproduce the initial beryllium spin states , which they can measure through the light scattered by the beryllium ions ( spin up scatters laser light , whereas spin down does not ) .
BEIJING ( Reuters ) - Chinese web users flooded to a trendy art zone cafe on Wednesday to celebrate a last - minute halt to a rollout of government - sponsored filtering software , and make a stand for freedom of expression in the Communist - run state .
Dressed in t-shirts mocking the Green Dam program , about 200 Beijing residents had arrived by mid-morning to eat a traditional Chinese breakfast , denounce censorship and prepare for a day - long party .
Originally conceived as part of an Internet boycott to mark the July 1 launch of the filter -- and to give a web - addicted generation something to do during the 24 hours of offline -- the atmosphere was festive as guests celebrated what many said was an unexpected victory against state censorship .
“ This is a very rare example for the government to suddenly push back an important decision the night before it is due to be rolled out , ” said outspoken artist Ai Weiwei , who organized the boycott and the party .
Beijing made a surprising about - face late on Tuesday , hours before an edict that all personal computers sold in China must be preloaded with the program was due to come into force .
The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology said the launch would be postponed and did not give a new deadline .
Officials had said the software was intended to stamp out Internet pornography .
But it was assailed by activists , industry groups and foreign officials as politically intrusive , technically flawed and commercially unfair .
“ We are very happy because we got what we wanted , ” said Liu Yaohua , a 27 - year - old artist .
“ We wanted to express our attitude to Green Dam . ”
There was trepidation among some party - goers about attending an event that was a direct , if light - hearted , rebuke to a government wary of public challenges to its control .
“ I am a little bit nervous , but I felt it was very important that I find the strength to come , ” said painter Zang Yi .
The plan might now drift into oblivion if Beijing decides it does not want to face a second round of pressure from overseas and at home .
At a Beijing mall which specializes in computers and software , vendors shrugged at the news of the climbdown .
“ It ’s a piece of software like any other .
You can take it out if you do n’t want it .
It ’s no big deal , ” said Zhang Bo , standing in front of a row of Chinese - made laptops .
But a lawyer who campaigned against the software warned it was premature to declare victory .
“ It has not been canceled , just put back , so it ’s possible that after a certain amount of time it will be pushed back out , ” said Liu Xiaoyuan , who wants the government to explain why a software ostensibly designed to protect a minority of users -- children and teen - agers -- must be installed on all computers .
Artist
Ai said battles over censorship would continue , but the government may have shot itself in the foot with Green Dam , by galvanizing young web users .
“ When young people who grew up in the 1980s and 1990s found that the computers , which are so vital to their life , might be affected , it very naturally caused a kind of politicization . ”
Australian graphics designer Josh Darrah is the man responsible for this rather stunning case mod , which saw him gut his iPod Mini and reassemble it in an Australian red cedar case with brass finishings .
Perhaps the most stunning feature , considering the fact that it is made from wood , is the perfectly carved wooden click wheel .
The case was carved by hand with a little help from Darrah ’s trusty Dremel , and he added an improvement to the mix in the form of an on - board iTrip FM transmitter .
A matching iPod dock completes the package , which took the best part of 4 weekends to put together at a total cost of AUD $ 16 .
If you are interested in getting your own , it may be a possibility as Darrah is considering a means by which his case might be mass produced and sold in kit form .
He also plans to extend his modding to other members of the iPod family , and possibly to the iPhone .

AMERICA'S health - care system is the costliest in the world , gobbling up about 16 % of the country 's economic output .
Comparisons with other rich countries and within the United States show that its system is not only growing at an unsustainable pace , but also provides questionable value for money and dubious medical care .
Economists at the OECD found that America does indeed do well on some measures , such as breast - cancer survival rates and cervical - cancer screening , but does worse in others .
Infant mortality was 6.7 per 1,000 births in 2007 , against an OECD average ( excluding Mexico and Turkey ) of 4.0 .
Reforms are being considered to extend coverage for the 49 m people with no health insurance , possibly by obliging individuals to buy insurance .
NAROK , Kenya —
For nine days Peter Nyaga watched as the Naituipak section of Mau Forest burned .
The park ranger was helpless against the raging bush fire that destroyed acre after acre of wooded hillside .
Encroaching farmers deliberately lit that fire .
Elsewhere the 988,000 acre Mau Forest is eaten up by land grabbers , some of whom are invading farmers , others the recipients of ‘ land for votes ’ .
Unlicensed timber felling and illegal charcoal production is also taking its toll .
It is estimated that a staggering 222,000 acres has already been destroyed .
“ If this does not stop the forest will be decimated , ” warned Tuqa Jirmo , Kenya Wildlife Service chief warden for the Mau Forest , based near Narok in the southern Rift Valley .
The problem is that this dwindling montane forest keeps Kenya alive acting as a huge water tower feeding a dozen rivers and five lakes .
The rivers power Kenya ’s hydroelectric stations fuelling economic growth ; many of the country ’s most famous tourist destinations rely on the rivers for their survival ; and the moisture trapped in the forest provides ideal conditions for growing tea , one of Kenya ’s key export earners .
“ Deforestation affects the drivers of our economy : tourism , agriculture and hydropower , ” explained Jackson Bambo at the Kenya Forest Working Group in Nairobi .
“ If the Mau disappeared our lakes would silt up , it would kill our tourism industry and power costs for
the common man would increase hugely . ”
In some areas of the Mau , the thick forest has been replaced by grasslands dotted with tree stumps or neat fields of wheat and maize .
Every day trucks loaded with hardwoods worth tens of thousands of dollars drive out of the forest and makeshift earth - covered kilns turn decades - old trees into $ 15 sacks of charcoal .
At this time of year thousands of tourists from around the world visit the famous Masai Mara National Reserve to watch the antelope ‘ migration ’ as millions of wildebeest make their annual charge northwards in search of grazing pastures .
This year there are fears that the destruction of the Mau Forest might mean the end of the natural spectacle as the Mara River that runs from the Mau Forest feeds the Masai Mara ( as well as Tanzania ’s renowned Serengeti National Park ) .
The destruction of the Mau Forest means there is no control of the flow of water causing dry rivers and flooding disturbing the natural cycle on which the wilderbeest , and the other wild animals , rely .
“ Without the Mau there will be no Masai Mara , ” said Jirmo .
A visit to Lake Nakuru National Park — famous for the pink flamingos that throng the lake — reveals how bad things are getting .
The waters have receded because the four rivers that feed the lake run from the Mau Forest and all four are dry .
The local authority has taken to pumping recycled water from the nearby Nakuru town while fresh water is pumped into the park to feed the rhinos , buffalo and gazelle .
Flamingo numbers are down as the birds increasingly looking elsewhere to gather and feed .
The birds are doubly threatened by the Mau destruction as another river runs from the forest to their breeding ground in Lake Natron on the border with Tanzania .
Falling water levels in the rivers have reduced Kenya ’s power generation capacity and tea harvests are fluctuating wildly as the Mau ’s function as a moisture reservoir and buffer against rain and temperature changes is degraded .
If all this sounds bad , it is .
But there could be worse news to come .
“ No studies have yet been done on the full impact of Mau deforestation , ” said Christian Lambrechts of the United Nations Environment Program .
“ We just do n’t know what the impact will be , yet we are dealing with core economic sectors for Kenya : energy , tea and tourism . ”
Kenya ’s government , which under previous regimes did so much to exacerbate the forest ’s destruction by handing out land for votes in the run up to multiparty elections , is belatedly paying attention .
A government task force has reported its findings and there is talk of evictions , resettlement and compensation , of boosting the number of rangers patrolling the Mau Forest and even of fencing the entire area .
All this will help but Kenya is running out of time and the shaky coalition government formed in the wake of murderously disputed elections in late 2007 is frequently paralyzed into inaction by its own divisions .
Back in the Mau Forest , four months after the fire , green shoots cover the sooty soil and pale bracken grows over the charred stumps and blackened trunks .
“ The forest is recovering , ” said ranger Nyaga , “ but it is not the same . ”
The trees that burned were cedars and yellowwood : they will take years , not months , to grow back .
“ It is a Kenya lifeline , ” Jirmo summed up .
“ We have no option : the Mau Forest must be conserved . ”

August 24 , 2009 Officials Weigh Circumcision to Fight H.I.V. Risk By RONI CARYN RABIN Public health officials are considering promoting routine circumcision for all baby boys born in the United States to reduce the spread of H.I.V. , the virus that causes AIDS .
The topic is a delicate one that has already generated controversy , even though a formal draft of the proposed recommendations , due out from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention by the end of the year , has yet to be released .
Experts are also considering whether the surgery should be offered to adult heterosexual men whose sexual practices put them at high risk of infection .
But they acknowledge that a circumcision drive in the United States would be unlikely to have a drastic impact : the procedure does not seem to protect those at greatest risk here , men who have sex with men .
[ " Also " ?
If they were serious about preventing HIV , would n't adult men at high risk be their first priority ? ]
Recently , studies showed that in African countries hit hard by AIDS , men who were circumcised reduced their infection risk by half .
But the clinical trials in Africa focused on heterosexual men who are at risk of getting H.I.V. from infected female partners .
[ They always say " reduce by half " or " reduce by 60 % " - the relative risk reduction - because it sounds more than " reduce 1.8 % " - the absolute risk reduction , and they never mention that it would take more than 40 circumcisions to prevent one HIV infection in Africa , hundreds or thousands in the US . ]
For now , the focus of public health officials in this country appears to be on making recommendations for newborns , a prevention strategy that would only pay off many years from now .
Critics say it subjects baby boys to medically unnecessary surgery without their consent .
But Dr. Peter Kilmarx , chief of epidemiology for the division of H.I.V./ AIDS prevention at the C.D.C. , said that any step that could thwart the spread of H.I.V. must be given serious consideration .
" We have a significant H.I.V. epidemic in this country , and we really need to look carefully at any potential intervention that could be another tool in the toolbox we use to address the epidemic , " Dr. Kilmarx said .
" What we 've heard from our consultants is that there would be a benefit for infants from infant circumcision , and that the benefits outweigh the risks . "
[ That is simply nonsense .
The only possible benefit to infants is a one chance in 190 of it preventing a usually readily treatable urinary tract infection . ]
He and other experts acknowledged that although the clinical trials of circumcision in Africa had dramatic results , the effects of circumcision in the United States were likely to be more muted because the disease is less prevalent here , because it spreads through different routes and because the health systems are so disparate as to be incomparable .
[ The " dramatic results " amount , in total , to 73 circumcised men who might have been infected if their groups totalling 5,411 men had not been circumcised . ]
Clinical trials in Kenya , South Africa and Uganda found that heterosexual men who were circumcised were up to 60 percent less likely to become infected with H.I.V. over the course of the trials than those who were not circumcised .
[ " Up to 60 % " is like " Up to 50 % off " at sales - it 's called " bait advertising " or " bait and switch " . ]
There is little to no evidence that circumcision protects men who have sex with men from infection .
Another reason circumcision would have less of an impact in the United States is that some 79 percent of adult American men are already circumcised , public health officials say .
[ Put another way , circumcision has had no impact . ]
But newborn circumcision rates have dropped off in recent decades , to about 65 percent of all newborns in 1999 from a high of about 80 percent after World War II , according to C.D.C. figures .
And blacks and Hispanics , who have been affected disproportionately by AIDS , are less likely than whites to circumcise their baby boys , according to the agency .
[ They get that result by pooling blacks and Hispanics : Blacks are circumcised almost as much as whites and get more HIV , Hispanics much less and get less .
It 's socioeconomic factors , not circumcision .
Asians circumcise much less and get much less HIV . ]
Circumcision rates have fallen in part because the American Academy of Pediatrics , which sets the guidelines for infant care , does not endorse routine circumcision .
Its policy says that circumcision is " not essential to the child 's current well - being , " and as a result , many state Medicaid programs do not cover the operation .
The academy is revising its guidelines , however , and is likely to do away with the neutral tone in favor of a more encouraging policy stating that circumcision has health benefits even beyond H.I.V. prevention , like reducing urinary tract infections for baby boys , said Dr. Michael Brady , a consultant to the American Academy of Pediatrics .
[ " Reducing " is a weasel word .
From what , to what ?
Scores of babies have to be circumcised in vain to prevent one UTI . ]
He said the academy would probably stop short of recommending routine surgery , however .
" We do have evidence to suggest there are health benefits , and families should be given an opportunity to know what they are , " he said .
But , he said , the value of circumcision for H.I.V. protection in the United States is difficult to assess , adding , " Our biggest struggle is trying to figure out how to understand the true value for Americans . "
[ After 120 years of doing it medically , and they still do n't know that it 's any good ? ]
Circumcision will be discussed this week at the C.D.C.'s National H.I.V.
Prevention Conference in Atlanta , which will be attended by thousands of health professionals and H.I.V. service providers .
Among the speakers is a physician from Operation Abraham , an organization based in Israel and named after the biblical figure who was circumcised , according to the book of Genesis , when he was 99 years old .
The group trains doctors in Africa to perform circumcisions on adult men to reduce the spread of H.I.V .
[ This just underlines that circumcision is a Stone Age blood ritual . ]
Members of Intact America , a group that opposes newborn circumcision , have rented mobile billboards that will drive around Atlanta carrying their message that " circumcising babies does n't prevent H.I.V. , " said Georganne Chapin , who leads the organization .
Although the group 's members oppose circumcision on broad philosophical and medical grounds , Ms. Chapin argued that the studies in Africa found only that circumcision reduces H.I.V. infection risk , not that it prevents infection .
" Men still need to use condoms , " Ms. Chapin said .
[ Broad philosophical grounds like , " Whose body is it ? " ]
In fact , while the clinical trials in Africa found that circumcision reduced the risk of a man 's acquiring H.I.V. , it was not clear whether it would reduce the risk to women from an infected man , several experts said .
[ It was so clear that it does n't protect women they stopped the study , and it may have shown that circumcision increased the risk . ]
" There 's mixed data on that , " Dr. Kilmarx said .
But , he said , " If we have a partially successful intervention for men , it will ultimately lower the prevalence of H.I.V. in the population , and ultimately lower the risk to women . "
[ This is purely hypothetical , and could easily be overwhelmed by other factors , such as circumcised men pushing unprotected sex on women . ]
Circumcision is believed to protect men from infection with H.I.V. because the mucosal tissue of the foreskin is more susceptible to H.I.V. and can be an entry portal for the virus .
[ This is still highly theoretical , and based on the assumption that it does protect . ]
Observational studies have found that uncircumcised men have higher rates of other sexually transmitted diseases like herpes and syphilis , and a recent study in Baltimore found that heterosexual men were less likely to have become infected with H.I.V. from infected partners if they were circumcised .
[... based on 50 intact African - American men , of whom 11 were infected - far too few to draw any statistical conclusion . ]
Voters steer Europe to the right
Spain 's centre - right Popular Party was one of the night 's big winners
Centre - right parties have done well in elections to the European Parliament at the expense of the left .
Far - right and anti-immigration parties also made gains , as turnout figures plunged to 43 % - the lowest since direct elections began 30 years ago .
The UK Labour Party , Germany 's Social Democrats and France 's Socialist Party were heading for historic defeats .
The centre - right European People 's Party ( EPP ) looks set to continue to hold power in the parliament .
Jose Manuel Barroso , who seems set for a second term as European Commission president following the centre - right success , thanked voters and assured them their voices would be heard .

Angela Merkel described the increase in the vote of her Christian Democrats over the Social Democrats as " sensational " and said it boded well for her chances in the nation 's general election in September .
In results so far : French President Nicolas Sarkozy 's UMP trounced socialist opponents , while greens from the Europe - Ecologie party also made gains
In Italy , Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi 's centre - right People of Freedom party won most votes - 35 % - although that was well below his prediction .
The anti-immigrant Northern League made strong gains
In the UK , the governing Labour Party suffered a serious defeat , gaining its lowest share of the vote for a century
Spain 's conservative Popular Party beat the ruling Socialists , but the four percentage point margin was lower than they had expected
Poland 's governing centre - right Civic Platform gained ground at the expense of the Eurosceptic Law and Justice Party
Portugal 's conservative Social Democrats secured about 31 % of the vote .
The ruling Socialists fell a massive 18 percentage points from the last European election , to about 26 %
Austria 's far right increased its vote on the last European election but was well down on its percentage in last year 's national polls
Greece 's Socialist party , PASOK , bucked the European trend by securing the largest vote percentage , ahead of the ruling conservatives Voters have been choosing representatives mainly from their own national parties , many of which then join EU - wide groupings with similarly - minded parties from other countries .
Hungary 's Jobbik party was one of several far - right groups to do well
The centre - right EPP retains its place as the largest grouping over the past five years , securing an estimated 264 of the 736 seats ( the overall number of seats in the assembly has been reduced from 785 ) .
The socialists are on 183 , while the liberal ALDE has an estimated 84 .
Provisional figures released by the EU suggested turnout was at an all - time low in some countries , including France , where it dropped to 40.5 % .
Lowest turnout was seen in Slovakia ( 19.6 % ) and Lithuania ( 20.9 % ) , while the highest figures came from Luxembourg ( 91 % ) and and Belgium ( 85.9 % ) - both countries where voting is compulsory .
Overall turnout has fallen at each European election in the last 30 years , from a high of nearly 62 % in 1979 .

A bailiff went to the Georges V hotel in Paris
A Saudi princess who allegedly owed thousands of dollars in shopping bills in Paris has agreed to pay up after a bailiff visited her hotel , lawyers say .
Maha al - Sudairi , the wife of the Saudi interior minister , is paying more than $ 120,000 ( 85,700 euros ; £ 72,800 ) to one store , according to its lawyer .
It came after a court order was issued allowing the seizure of her belongings .
The bailiff had gone to the luxury George V hotel , just off the famous Champs Elysee in the French capital .
Maha al - Sudairi has been staying at the hotel , which is owned by her nephew .
She has diplomatic immunity because of her husband 's status .
Relief
The decision to settle the bill followed the court order obtained on behalf of the clothing chain , Key Largo .
It was owed $ 125,000 .
The shop 's lawyer , Jacky Benazerah , said repeated demands for payment had been ignored and described the settlement as a relief .
He said : " The operation ordered by the judge began at 4.30 pm in the presence of the local police chief .
It seems that during the operation the Saudi consul turned up in person and , following talks , a guaranteed cheque for the total sum owed to my client was handed over . "
But the BBC's Alasdair Sandford , in Paris , says the princess allegedly owes large sums to several chic Parisian stores from various shopping sprees carried out over the past year .
One lingerie store opposite the Georges V says it has been unable to recoup nearly $ 100,000 .
This is not the first time the Saudi princess has made headlines .
In 1995 , she was accused of beating a servant in Florida whom she suspected of stealing from her .
No charges were filed .

昨日 はITpro主催のイベント 「 ユーザー企業のためのエンタープライズ・クラウドフォーラム」に参加してきました。
日経コンピュータ 中田敦記者のセッション 「 みえてきたクラウドのコスト」では、グーグル、アマゾン、マイクロソフトの最新データセンターの動向を紹介してくれたのですが、これが非常に興味深い内容でした。セッションの内容からトピックを2つほど紹介します。
大規模データセンターは7倍効率がよい
1つ目は、日経コンピュータ2009年7月8日号で同記者が記事としても書いていることなのですが、データセンターの規模の経済について。1000台クラスの中規模データセンターと、5万台クラスのデータセンターを比較すると、大規模データセンターのほうが7倍も効率がよいというデータが示されています。
つまり、ユーザーがある大きさのコンピュータリソースを調達しようとするとき、大規模データセンターは中規模データセンターと比べて7分の1程度の価格でそれを提供可能かもしれない、ということです。クラウドベンダーにとって規模が勝負を決する大きな要素であり、先行する3社が巨大なデータセンターの構築に没頭している理由がよく分かります。
もちろん、実際にはこれほど単純な話ではなく、例えばセールスフォース・ドットコムは約1000台のサーバしか持たず、徹底的な効率化による低価格化を実現するなどの例も挙げられていました。
最新のデータセンターは冷房がない
2つ目のトピックは、「最新のデータセンターはエアコンを使わないのが常識」になっているという点です。
データセンターは電気代だけで年間数億円以上になるため、電力を有効に使えるかどうかがコストに大きく響いてきます。そのため、できるだけ余計な電力消費を抑えるようにしなければなりません。
日本でデータセンターといえば、耐震ビルの中にラックが並び、寒いくらいの冷房が効いている、というイメージがあります。
しかし、いまはグーグル、アマゾン、マイクロソフトともデータセンターにはビルのような建屋などなく、駐車場のようなところにコンテナを並べる方法が主流になっているそうです。そのコンテナにパイプで冷却水を供給し、外気と組み合わせることで、できるだけ電力を消費せずにサーバ群を冷却するのです。
さらにデータセンターの最先端を行くグーグルは「もっともっと非常識」だと中田記者は指摘しています。ベルギーにあるグーグルの最新データセンターはもはや冷房装置を備えておらず、しかもその一部はすでに稼働を開始しているというのです。
グーグル が2007年2 月に「 Failure Trends in a Large Disk Drive Population」という論文で、温度が上昇してもハードディスクの故障率が変わらないということを指摘しており、こうしたこれまでのグーグルの経験や調査が、冷房装置を持たないデータセンターを実現するための裏付けとなっているのだろうと中田記者は予想していました。
ベルギーに最新のグーグルデータセンター
中田記者のセッションを聞いたあとで、あらためてグーグルのデータセンターについて調べてみると、偶然にもDataCenterKnowledgeの昨日の記事に、その冷房装置を持たない最新のグーグルのデータセンターの解説記事「 Google's Chiller -less Data Center」が掲載されていました。
記事によると、これまでのデータセンターでは、通常は外気と水冷を組み合わせて冷却し、外気温が高いときには冷房装置をさらに稼働させていたそうですが、その冷却装置を持たないデータセンターをグーグルがベルギーで運用開始したとのこと。
ベルギーの首都ブリュッセルの年間の平均気温は約19度から22度で、この気温が冷房装置を不要にすることを後押ししてくれていると、グーグルのエンジニアは説明したそうです。
温度が上がってきたらデータセンターごと切り替える！
この記事で は 「でももし気候が変わって気温が上がってきたらどうするのか？」と突っ込んだ質問をしていますが、それに対するグーグルの回答はまさに非常識なものでした。データセンターにまたがって負荷を切り替える、というのです。
Google says it will turn off equipment as needed in Belgium and shift computing load to other data centers .
This approach is made possible by the scope of the company 's global network of data centers , グーグルの回答は、そのときにはデータセンターの機器をオフにして、負荷をほかのデータセンターに切り替える、というものでした。これは、グローバルにデータセンターをネットワーク化しているグーグルだから可能なことです。
つまりサーバが熱くなったら冷房で冷やすのではなくて、単にスイッチを切って冷めるのを待つというのです。そこまでして冷房を節約することにグーグルはこだわっているのですね。
そしてグーグルは、データセンターレベルでの休止やダウンのときにマニュアルで切り替えるためのツールを備えており、運用チームは定期的なメンテナンスのときに切り替え訓練も行っている、のだそうです。
グーグル は5 月 に「 The Datacenter as a Computer : An Introduction to the Design of Warehouse - Scale Machines ( PDF ) 」という論文を発表していますが、この表題のように、まるで故障時にサーバを切り替えるようにデータセンターを切り替える、というスケールの大きさには圧倒されそうです。
グーグルのデータセンターは月を追いかける？
しかもこの話には続きがあり、この記事ではさらに驚くべき考えが紹介されています。それは「月を追いかける（follow the moon）データセンター 」というコンセプトです。
夜間は外気温も低く、また電気料金も安くなっています。そこで、世界中のデータセンターのうち、夜になっている地域のデータセンターだけを稼働させれば、低い外気温を活用でき、しかも夜間の安い電気料金を利用できます。これはクラウド技術者のあいだで議論されている構想ですが、グローバルにデータセンターを展開し、その負荷をダイナミックに切り替えられるグーグルであればそれを実現可能かもしれない、とこの記事「
Google's Chiller - less Data Center 」では解説されています。
それはすなわち最先端のデータセンターにとっては、構築にかかる費用よりも電気代を節約するほうがずっと重要である、ということを示しています。たしかに、最先端のデータセンターはこれまで一般に考えられていたデータセンターのイメージからは全くかけ離れた、非常識なものへと進化しているようです。

David Rohde , a New York Times reporter who was kidnapped seven months ago by the Taliban , escaped from a compound in Pakistan by jumping over a wall , the newspaper ’s website reported Saturday .
Rohde , 41 , recounted to his wife shortly after gaining his freedom Friday night that he and interpreter Tahir Ludin escaped their captors in the North Waziristan region but that their driver , Asadullah Mangal , opted to remain behind .
The three were abducted Nov. 10 in Afghanistan ’s Lowgar province , about 60 miles south of the Afghan capital , Kabul , after traveling there to interview a Taliban commander .
Rohde , part of a New York Times team last year that won a Pulitzer Prize for coverage of Pakistan and Afghanistan , was on leave to write a book on the history of U.S. involvement in Afghanistan when the three were seized .
One unsubstantiated report in Kabul suggested that Mangal developed sympathies for his captors , but this could not be confirmed .
Catherine Mathis , the paper ’s senior vice president for corporate communications , said she would not comment on his reasons for staying behind because there was conflicting information coming from the region .

Once over the wall , Rohde and Ludin managed to find a Pakistani military scout who took them to a nearby base .
On Saturday , they were flown to the American military base in Bagram , Afghanistan .
The capture of the three men in Afghanistan and their transportation to Pakistan suggests how porous this troubled border is as military forces on both sides are mulling a coordinated offensive .
The area is reportedly home to Osama bin Laden .
U.S. Navy Chief Petty Officer Brian Naranjo said Saturday night that he could not confirm that Rohde was at Bagram , adding that the U.S. military had no involvement in the operation .
The State Department , however , consulted closely with and assisted the newspaper during Rohde ’s captivity .
In Washington , White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said the U.S. was very pleased that Rohde was returning home safely , adding that the escape marks the end of a “ long and difficult ordeal . ”

Ludin , the interpreter , called his father about 3:30 a.m.
Saturday , shortly after escaping , and warned him to leave his house in Afghanistan immediately for fear of Taliban retaliation , said a source in Kabul who declined to be identified .
The source said Ludin ’s foot was injured in beatings by the Taliban , and he is getting medical care at Bagram .
The newspaper stated that preliminary reports suggested he injured himself while escaping .
Most of the newspaper ’s staff also vacated the company ’s bureau in Kabul on Saturday at Rohde ’s suggestion , amid fears it too might be targeted .
Mathis , the paper ’s vice president , declined to comment on those reports .
During the seven months of his captivity , the newspaper avoided publicizing the kidnapping and requested that other media do so as well , believing this offered the best chance of securing his release .
New York Times Executive Editor Bill Keller said on the company ’s website that the paper paid no ransom nor were any Taliban or other prisoners released .
He did n’t say whether there had been ransom negotiations , however .

Rohde and his wife , Kristen Mulvihill , were married just two months before his abduction .
Deciding not to make public statements after a kidnapping offers certain advantages , said Stephen Mastalerz , chief executive of Fayetteville , Ark. - based Trojan Securities International , a training and anti-kidnapping consulting firm .
“ Sometimes if you keep a low profile , it ’s easier to handle , depending on what group ’s involved , ” said Mastalerz , who specializes in abductions in Mexico and other Latin American countries .
Some of the factors that determine which strategy to follow , he said , include whether the group appears to be kidnapping just for money or whether it has a political agenda .
Advertisement
The fact that Rohde and Ludin were able to escape suggests that their captors let down their guard .
But often captors and captives develop a rapport , and the guards gradually give prisoners more freedom , security experts said , making an escape easier .
Rohde grew up in Maine and earned a bachelor ’s degree in history in 1990 at Brown University before joining the Christian Science Monitor .
The newspaper sent him in the mid-1990s to cover the Balkan conflict , where , while reporting on mass graves in Bosnian Serb territory in 1995 , he was seized and held for 10 days .
He won a Pulitzer Prize the following year for that coverage .

The CBO Says that Obama ’s Healthcare Reform Will not Save Money
The biggest reason that we have been given as proof that we need healthcare reform is the skyrocketing costs of healthcare .
The president has claimed that his plan will help to slow the rising costs of healthcare .
He has claimed that by spending trillions of dollars on reform we would save money over the long run .
Much like the spin on the stimulus package , which failed to provide the “ shovel ready ” jobs that it promised , it appears as though healthcare reform will not provide the promised savings .
At least that is what the latest report from the Congressional Budget Office said .
The CBO has estimated that healthcare reform will save $ 2 billion over ten years and while that sounds wonderful it is only a fraction of the $ 1 trillion that healthcare reform will cost .
Obama ’s plan will spend $ 1 trillion to save $ 2 billion .
Does that sound like a wise investment ?
It sure as hell does n’t to me .
Here is what Mitch McConnell had to say about this report :
The President said that rising health care costs are an imminent threat to our economy and that any reform must reduce these long - term costs .
But CBO has made clear once again that the Democrats ’ bills in Congress are n’t reducing costs and in fact could just make the problem worse
I think that statement sums it up quite well .
Under the president ’s plan we are going to raise taxes during a recession that will cost the American people damn close to $ 1 trillion .
The only thing that this will accomplish is to assure that the country ’s economy will keep sliding downhill .
As if we needed another reason to oppose this bill .
The CBO ’s assessment of the costs of Obama ’s healthcare reform bill should be the final nail in the coffin to this legislation .

Few nightingales are left to sing
The nightingale has effectively vanished from woodlands across the UK .
A 30 - year survey of British woodland birds has found that its population has fallen by more than 95 % .
Seventeen other bird species have also declined significantly , many of which overwinter in tropical west Africa where their habitat is being destroyed .
Numbers of starling , linnet , bullfinch and willow warbler all crashed , while 12 species , including the blackcap , magpie and collared dove , increased .
These startling trends in the populations of some of the UK's best known woodland birds comes from the British Trust for Ornithology 's ( BTO ) Common Bird Census , which gathered data on 49 species between 1967 and 1999 .
THE LOSERS Nightingale down 95 % Common starling down 91 % Linnet down 89 % Lesser redpoll down 85 % Spotted flycatcher down 83 % Lesser spotted woodpecker down 82 % Whitethroat down 81 % Willow tit down 77 % Yellowhammer down 77 % European turtle dove down 76 %
Tree pipit down 75 % Eurasian woodcock down 70 % Marsh tit down 68 % Common cuckoo down 63 % Dunnock down 57 % Willow warbler down 52 % Song thrush down 47 % Bullfinch down 39 %
The results of the survey have not been reported before .
Although the survey ended in 1999 , the data provides the longest and most up - to - date trends anywhere in the UK or Europe for how the composition of woodland bird species has changed in modern times .
Of the species studied , the populations of 17 species significantly decreased since 1967 , while the populations of 12 have significantly increased .
The greatest disappearing act has been that of the nightingale , whose numbers fell by 95 % over the study period .
Numbers of starling fell by 91 % , linnet by 89 % , lesser redpoll by 85 % , and spotted flycatcher by 83 % .
Of the birds whose status in woodlands improved , numbers of the collared dove increased by 1052 % , and the stock dove and wood pigeon by 359 % and 344 % respectively .
" Using these longer term datasets can provide really important additional insights over the more recent ones , " says Chris Hewson of the BTO , who along with colleague David Noble has published the latest trends in the journal Ibis .
" For instance , much ado was [ recently ] made over the Red Listing of the Cuckoo .
But an equally iconic species that missed out by the skin of its teeth was the nightingale , which actually declined in woodlands by 95 % over the period examined , more than any other species studied and greatly in excess of the 63 % decline shown by the cuckoo . "
Hewson says that had these longer term trends been taken into account , then the nightingale would have been Red Listed too .
The causes of the varying fates of British woodland birds are many and varied .
More than 80 % of lesser spotted woodpeckers have gone " Some scarce resident species such as the lesser spotted woodpecker , redpoll , willow tit and hawfinch have declined and we 're still not absolutely sure why , " says Hewson .
" But in some cases at least , less sympathetic woodland management looks a likely cause , along with possibly the impacts of browsing by an exploding deer population in some parts of the country . "
The availability of food explains other trends .
For example , numbers of collared and stock doves and wood pigeons have exploded due to the increased planting of winter crops , which provides a valuable source of food for these birds over the winter months .
In contrast , linnets and turtle doves have suffered due to a lack of seeds in the summer .
However , changes in habitat outside of the UK are also having a major impact , particularly on migrant woodland species that spend part of the year in Africa .
" Our results illustrate that a whole suite of migrants are declining , but that over the 32 year period we studied the species of migrant in decline changed , " says Chris Hewson .
During the beginning of the survey period , during the late 1960s and early 1970s , it was species such as whitethroat and redstart that spend the winter in the arid Sahel just south of the Sahara that were suffering due to drought conditions in that region .
" Now , though , these species are doing ok as rainfall levels have recovered , " says Hewson .
" But by the end of the period we looked at it was the species that winter further south in the humid tropics of west Africa that were suffering . "
THE WINNERS Collared dove up 1052 % Stock dove up 359 % Woodpigeon up 344 % Jackdaw up 311 % Black - billed magpie up 292 % Eurasian nuthatch up 226 % Green woodpecker up 180 % Carrion crow up 180 % Blackcap up 161 % Winter wren up 139 % European robin up 138 % Great tit up 129 %
More recent data from the British Bird Survey , which replaced the Common Bird Census in 2000 , shows that all the woodland species that migrate from west Africa continue to decline .
" That leads us to believe they are suffering from changes occurring in west Africa , possibly due to the intensification of agriculture and other land use changes leading to habitat degradation , " says Hewson .
The BTO has now started a major research programme to study these migrant birds , backed by an appeal called Out of Africa recently launched in an attempt to fund the work .
That will involve starting a field project in Ghana and Burkina Faso this October with the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds .
The BTO is also collaborating on a pan-European project to track the migrations of nightingales using GPS tags , to find out more about where British nightingales spend the winter .
" This research will hopefully enable us to identify what the changes happening in Africa are that are causing these declines and ultimately , we hope , to enable us to come up with suggestions for solutions that would benefit not just the birds but also the people who live there , " says Hewson .

Advertisement A small pizzeria in Angus has won its battle with global fast food chain Kentucky Fried Chicken ( KFC ) over the term " Family Feast " .
The Titanic Pizza Co in Carnoustie was warned by KFC to stop using the slogan to describe one of its meal deals because it had trademarked the name .
The Angus takeaway said it had been using the phrase since 1992 .
The chicken chain has now written to Titanic to say the matter would not be taken any further .
Titanic 's Family Feast is made up of two pizzas , garlic bread , onion rings , chips and juice ; while the KFC deal comprises 12 pieces of chicken , four portions of chips , coleslaw , beans and a drink .
KFC 's lawyers sent a letter to Titanic saying it had trademarked the term Family Feast in 1994 and 2003 .
It 's just a lesson to everybody to stand up for themselves
Marie Fagan
Titanic Pizza Co
The Carnousite pizzeria owners wrote backing saying " we refuse to be bullied by a global conglomerate such as yourselves " .
Co-owner Marie Fagan is pleased their tough stance paid off .
" The amount of support we 've had from people has been amazing , " she said .
" We even had a letter from a guy in Florida saying how disgusted he was and he has sent a really horrible letter to them [ KFC ] saying he 's never going to set foot in the shop again . "
And Ms Fagan has seen business boom since news of the row broke .
" People were asking where the shop was and ordering Family Feasts , it 's really been great , so KFC kind of did us a favour .
" It 's just a lesson to everybody to stand up for themselves . "

* US needs contingency plan for more stimulus , says adviser
* Job losses show U.S. economy not yet stabilising
* Stimulus effective but much slower than expected ( Adds quotes , detail , background )
SINGAPORE , July 7 ( Reuters ) - The United States should be planning for a possible second round of fiscal stimulus to further prop up the economy after the $ 787 billion rescue package launched in February , an adviser to President Barack Obama said .
“ We should be planning on a contingency basis for a second round of stimulus , ” Laura D’Andrea Tyson , a member of the panel advising President Barack Obama on tackling the economic crisis .
said on Tuesday .
Addressing a seminar in Singapore , Tyson said she felt the first round of stimulus aimed to prop up the economy had been slightly smaller than she would have liked and that a possible second round should be directed at infrastructure investment .
“ The stimulus is performing close to expectations but not in timing , ” Tyson said , referring to the slow pace at which the first round of stimulus had been spent on the economy .
Tyson , who is a dean of the Haas School of Business at University of California , Berkeley and was also a White House economic adviser to former President Bill Clinton , said an additional factor affecting the stimulus was that the economy was in a far worse shape than the administration had estimated .
INFLATION NOT A CONCERN
Tyson dispelled concerns about the ballooning U.S. fiscal deficit that is estimated to hit nearly 10 percent of gross domestic product , and its possible inflationary consequences .
“ The Federal Reserve is not going to allow the U.S. to inflate away its debt , ” she said .
Asked about the value of the dollar , Tyson said the market was wrong to be concerned about inflation in the U.S. economy , given the amount of slack in most industries .
“ It is almost in no one ’s interest to have a sharply spiralling downward dollar , ” she said .
The dollar ought to decline in the longer term on a trade - weighted basis but she did not anticipate a sharp and sudden decline .
Turning to the Federal Reserve ’s near - zero rates policy and credit easing , Tyson said inflationary expectations remained “ well - grounded ” , giving policymakers room to pursue these expansionary policies .
She said she was also not worried about whether the Fed can exit such a policy .
“ The Federal Reserve has the ability to make rapid adjustments in its balance - sheet as necessary . ”
But Tyson said the combination of near - zero interest rates and heavy debt issuance would keep the U.S. yield curve steep .
And , while the rate at which the economy was contracting had fallen , the latest jobs data showed the economy was still not stabilising .
U.S. unemployment rate hit 9.5 percent in June , the highest in nearly 26 years .

Dave Beazley , Wesley Chun , and Mark Summerfield discuss Python performance , the reasons you might ( or might not ) want to move to Python 3 , how new Python programmers should approach the language , multicore programming , and the difficulty of keeping technical books useful .
Ordinarily , we interview book authors one - on - one , asking them about their expertise in a given technology and the trends they see in their area .
This time , we put three authors in the same ( virtual ) room and gave them free rein to talk about anything related to Python .
And oh boy , did they talk about Python !
As you 'll see in this article , Dave Beazley , Wesley Chun , and Mark Summerfield had plenty to share with Cameron Laird about how the 2.x and 3.x strains of Python compare , how to get the most performance out of Python , how newcomers — including young students — relate to Python , and the different ways their books present key topics .
In case you 're unfamiliar with these authors :
Mark Summerfield has his own consultancy , Qtrac Ltd .
" I spend my time writing programs and documentation in C++ , Python ( also JavaScript , Perl , and unfortunately Tcl ) . "
Among his books are two on Python , including Programming in Python 3 and Rapid GUI Programming with Python and Qt .
David Beazley is the author of Python Essential Reference .
He 's also an independent developer , and has written a number of known packages such as Swig .
" I also spend quite a bit of time doing Python training , " he adds .
All his Python material ( including some he mentions here ) can be found on his home page .
Wesley Chun says of himself : Wesley Chun : " I code , I teach , I write . "
He 's the author of Core Python Programming , 2nd Edition and Python Fundamentals ( Video Training ) .
As you 'll see , they had a comfortable and casual discussion .
Laird :
One of the aspects of Python that interests me is how well it serves audiences that sometimes have no knowledge of each other .
Python , for example , has enthusiastic following among some scientific programmers , some text - oriented people doing things like PLY , some folks new to programming , sysadmins , and so on .
Dave , your Reference is in its fourth edition now ; do you have any sense about how well it serves newcomers to Python ?
Beazley :
To be honest , I 've never had a good sense for how the Essential Reference serves absolute newcomers .
I always intended for the book to target professional programmers .
Similar to a " K&R " [ Kernighan and Ritchie 's The C Programming Language ] book for Python perhaps .
Laird :
What 's new in the Fourth edition ?
Beazley : A major feature is almost a complete rewrite to handle Python 2.6/3.0 changes .
Concurrent programming also plays a prominent role .
There are major new sections that get into things like the new multiprocessing module , coroutines , and other advanced topics .
Summerfield : Huh !
My Python 3 book is Python 's K&R !
I always thought the Essential Reference was more like Python in a Nutshell by Martelli .
Laird :
You 've got me laughing already .
You 've hit topics that each can support their own books , and about which we could chat for days .
Summerfield : I 'm certainly looking forward to reading the new Essential Reference , for exactly those topics but also for its library coverage .
Beazley : I have to admit that I just jump right into the fray with the new edition .
There 's a practical example involving coroutines on something like page 20 of the intro .
Note Co-routines are an increasingly popular programming construct that give the concurrency of threads without the threads ' fragility .
Laird :
You 've been working through Python 2.x and 3.x in detail .
If someone has a focus on multicore programming , is 2.x of interest , or should he push straight toward 3.x ?
I assume we all agree that multiprocessing is only going to become more important in day - to - day coding .
Beazley :
The choice of Python versions is a really tough question .
Both Python 2.x and 3.x support the same basic features and libraries in this regard .
Summerfield : Yes , like GvR ( Guido van Rossum ) and [ Donald ] Knuth etc. , multiprocessing seems to be a better approach than threading ; seems to me that threading pushes a whole layer of not - relevant - to - the - problem technical burden on the Python coder .
Of course multiprocessing does that too , but it [ Python multi- processing ] seems less error prone [ than threading ] .
Beazley : For any kind of CPU - bound work , multiprocessing is definitely what you want to consider .
Threads often get a bad rap , but still work pretty well if you use them for I /O processing .
Laird : I regard that as the best brief summary : Threading is relatively error - prone , among the alternatives .
Summerfield : Haskell has a possible solution : software transactional memory ...
Note Haskell is a programming language which is considerably different from Java and C , and also different from Python .
Beazley :
The thing I like about multiprocessing is that the whole approach is much more general purpose .
Summerfield : Yes , and that 's a much better match for a VHLL [ very high - level language ] than threading , which is intrinsically low level .
Python should n't ask the programmer to do more than express their problem ( yeah unrealistic , but an aim ) .
Beazley : I have to admit that I 'm a bit biased though .
My background prior to Python was writing large message - passing applications .
So , multiprocessing appeals to me in that sense .
Note " Message - passing " is a model for concurrent or parallel programming which is quite different from usual threads programming .
Summerfield : I 'm biased too : but that 's because I find multithreaded programs much harder to debug .
Laird : What holds Python 3 back ?
Summerfield : Python 2 ( especially Python 2.5 and 2.6 ) is really excellent .
Python 3 was a point - zero [ release ] ; but now that it is . 1 there 's less excuse .
Python 3.0's I/O was slow ; that 's now fixed .
Python 3 is ( a bit ) incompatible so there are a few things to learn .
Above all , key libraries have n't yet been converted , e.g. NumPy .
( But PyQt has . )
So why switch ?
Python 3 brings plain text out of the closet .
In Python 3 , plain text always has an encoding , something that is true in the real world but which most of us have ignored for far too long .
Python 3 has nicer and more consistent syntax with only one kind of class and one int type ( and the latter sensibly promotes to float when non-integer division is used ) .
type ( and the latter sensibly promotes to float when non-integer division is used ) .
Python 3 makes much more use of iterators ( so is more efficient ) .
Python 3 does n't do random ordering of incompatible types like Python 2 does .
Python 3 has comprehensions for lists , dicts , and sets , as well as non-empty set literals .
, and sets , as well as non-empty set literals .
Plus a zillion other improvements , such as str.format ( ) , although quite a few of these have been backported .
Laird :
How well do your readers absorb these cultural insights ?
Are they looking just for library references , or do they Search the Tao , or ...?
Summerfield : Yes , I get e-mails regularly , although not in proportion to sales .
I get errata emails too , but fortunately my code is extracted from the source rather than cut / pasted into the PDF so I think I get fewer typos than most books .
Beazley :
Well , I have to admit that I 've never really thought about " cultural " insights in the context of the book .
Laird : I mean things like , not just threading , or how to work with the GIL [ Global Interpreter Lock ] , but how to think about it .
Your GIL talk certainly is an example .
Note GIL is Python 's global interpreter lock .
Its approximate purpose is to prevent Python threads from confusing each other .
Beazley :
In some sense , I 'm going to try to give balanced treatment to every approach ( threads , multiprocessing , etc. ) and talk about things to avoid .
Regarding e-mails , I do n't get tons of e-mails about the Essential Reference — except when something is broken .
Ha !
Summerfield : I 'm not sure how concerned the " average " Python programmer needs to be about the GIL .
I hope the " average " programmer never really needs to know or care about it .
Python is high level after all .
Beazley : I think a big part of the problem is that understanding a lot of that stuff can only really come from experience — and usually bad experiences .
For instance , that GIL talk I gave was really aimed at the extreme high - end : someone who might have taken a graduate course in operating systems or written multithreaded apps .
I completely agree with Mark that average Python programmers should n't have to ever concern themselves with such matters .
Laird :
All true .
Yes , one can write many , many fine Python applications without once thinking about GIL ( or threading , or eval ( ) , or lambda , or ... ) .
But as we all know , there are times when they demand attention .
Summerfield : Yes , when you hit the GIL wall , sure you have to stop !
" How to think about complicated problems " is what patterns are about , in some ways .
Unfortunately , because Java " normalized " threading , some programmers feel they must use it , even when they do n't need to or ought not to .
But it 's not surprising .
I found " Foundations of multithreaded , parallel , and distributed programming " by Andrews way too hard .
Beazley :
It 's unfortunate that there is so much confusion about threads generally , though .
For example , a lot of people simply think that " threads are evil " without ever giving it much thought .
Then , they go running off into asynchronous I/O and all sorts of other madness — which has its own peculiar set of complexities ( often greater than threads ) .
Laird : Bluntly , you three are among the people doing the most to correct that " it 's unfortunate … " situation .
Your books are just as you already said :
You lay out the alternatives , and show how to make best advantage of each .
Summerfield : David 's right that " threads are evil " is silly but doing threads right can be hard !
Beazley : Oh yes .
Wicked hard !
One thing that I think is really interesting is how a totally different community of programmers is now thinking about concurrent programming .
Summerfield : I recently read The Art of Multiprocessor Programming .
It is pragmatic , uses Java throughout , but it is still a very demanding book .
Beazley : Twenty years ago , I was heavily involved in parallel computing .
It was basically all Fortran all of the time .
That 's all anyone thought about .
Now , it 's this whole different set of problems and concerns .
So , I think a lot of what 's happening in Python , Ruby , Erlang , Scala , and other languages is really quite interesting .
Summerfield : Engineers in the university near me still use Fortran with parallel libraries .
Beazley :
Oh definitely , I would n't suggest that the Fortran crowd has gone away .
However , now virtually every programmer has access to multicore machines .
That 's pretty interesting .
Summerfield :
Well it'll be interesting to see if the Google project on Python threading succeeds .
Beazley : Agreed on the Unladen Swallow project .
Summerfield : I think multiprocessors are what have pushed threading to the forefront .
Did any of you read Tim Bray 's weblog on " Processors " ?
He said , " Now that the best and the brightest have spent a decade building and debugging threading frameworks in Java and .NET , it 's increasingly starting to look like threading is a bad idea ; do n't go there . "
Most modern threading libraries push a huge burden — essentially of bookkeeping — onto the programmer .
This is rather like the situation with pointers before garbage collectors became available .
Now Python is a VHLL , so naturally it has garbage collection , but right now it does n't offer any equivalent high level threading interface .
The Qt library ( 4.4 + ) has gone some way to addressing this in the C++/ Qt context with its QtConcurrent module while Haskell has gone the software transactional memory route .
In Python we have the multiprocessing module , but I still hope that other high level approaches will come along that take good advantage of multiple cores and processors but at the same time handle the low - level bookkeeping chores .
Beazley : Interesting .
Laird : Time - out ; we 're doing it again .
That is , chatting about this lovely abstraction - rich stuff that intrigues us , at the same time as we agree that most programmers can live without thinking about it .
The fact is , just as Mark already said , a far more common concern with them is , " How do I make a GUI ...? "
My real stake is with readers .
I like Python and I like theory , but my energy goes toward helping readers get the results they want from computers .
Beazley : Definitely agree that most programmers can live without thinking about concurrency .
Summerfield : Yeah , and sad to say most do n't care about GUIs .
Not on the desktop ; most seem interested in web GUIs which are n't nearly so nice or versatile ( although when a canvas is standardized it 'll help ) .
Python will deliver that better than any other language I 've tried , and Python 3 is better than Python 2 for beginners .
Beazley : I would agree .
One thing that interests me is the real extent to which most Python users use some of its advanced features .
Summerfield :
But what is " advanced " ?
I do n't think comprehensions are , but in my opinion , metaclasses are advanced .
Note Comprehensions are a Python convenience for expressing lists as functions of simpler lists .
Laird : Newcomers like comprehensions , indeed .
Summerfield :
When I first wanted to teach python I could n't present a uniform " If it has parentheses it is a function " because print was a statement !
So print ( ) actually helps start people off .
Beazley : I have to admit that I 've never run into many questions about print when teaching .
Chun : Same here .
Print usually comes off just fine as - is .
My [ teaching ] slides are both Python 2 and 3 compliant now , however , and colorized in a way that attendees can quickly identify the differences .
Laird : Clean - up , regularity , uniformity : That 's what Python 3 gives .
Summerfield :
The library has ( slightly ) better names and organization .
Beazley :
One issue that concerns me with Python 3 is the lack of libraries .
It seems like a lot of users who come into Python are doing so because of some third party package ( i.e. , plotting , numpy , etc. ) .
Summerfield :
It is the uniformity I wanted ( and now have with Python 3 ) .
Beazley :
The fact that many libraries do n't support Python 3 is definitely an issue .
Chun : I always recommend people start with Python 2 first , especially if you 're in industry , which is usually several releases behind .
Much less no dependencies being ported to Python 3 yet .
However , if you 're starting from scratch without dependencies , then you can go with 3 .
Summerfield : Yes , PyQt is now Python 3 but the biggie I think is numpy which seems really widely used .
Beazley : I also always recommend that people start with Python 2 — especially for industry .
Summerfield : I recommend 3 if you do n't need any non-ported libs to avoid the pain of the upgrade .
But yes , one problem for Python 3 is that Python 2 is soooooo good !
Beazley : I still encounter groups using Python 2.3 when teaching classes — often because they 're using some very specific package or library that requires it .
Chun : Exactly .
At my last job , we were on 2.3 and switched to 2.4 before I left in November , 2008 .
At my current job , we 're on 2.4 , but we 're using a custom version of Stackless , so porting becomes an issue .
Summerfield :
The main wall I hit is just the libraries .
Where 's numpy , etc . ?
Laird :
One of the things Python 's history should have taught us is that subtle shadings accumulate to make big differences .
Python is a good language — but what makes it so involves many small things combined .
Chun : Fortunately for me , my introductory and intermediate course focuses on only stdlib stuff , so issues like NumPy do n't show up that regularly .
Although I do point out when stdlib mods / packages change names in 3.x .
Summerfield : I think one difference with my experience is that I 'm involved with GUI apps .
Python gets shipped as part of the app , so they can use the version they want .
But I guess web developers are often stuck with whatever 's on the server .
Beazley : Unfortunately , what 's on the server is usually woefully out of date .
Laird : I 'm fighting in my daytime job , incidentally , with a database adapter documented for 1.5 .
Python 's cross-version compatibility is noteworthy — the libraries , though , can be a problem .
Beazley : I 'm ashamed to admit that my own Internet hosting provider still only provides Python 2.2 .
Which I discovered after writing some small WSGI thing that I wanted to try out .
Summerfield :
Well at least you can use Apache on your local machine or one of the Python lib's web servers .
Beazley : I have to admit that I 've always been a little puzzled by forwards compatibility in Python though .
I 've rarely had any of my own code break going forward between different Python 2.x releases .
Chun : Well , SCons [ a Python - based utility for managing application generation ] is 1.5 - compliant .
And they intend on keeping it that way and " front - port " features as they need them .
Beazley : Maybe I just do n't program anything interesting enough to break . :-)
Summerfield :
There is a subtle Python 3.0 versus 3.1 difference , because floating point numbers come out different ( you can have fewer digits in 3.1 with no loss of accuracy ) .
Beazley : Yes , I saw that change in 3.1 .
That is really interesting .
Chun :
Well , it only shows fewer digits .
Summerfield : that breaks doctests ... sure , it is a good change .
Note One of Python 's singular advantages is " doctest " , a kind of " literate programming " which encourages developers to write " self - testing " documentation .
Beazley : I actually have to talk about that in classes .
For instance , if you type x=3.4 , why does the interpreter show 3.39999999999999999 or something .
Chun : Yeah , they changed the way it 's represented .
So far , I 've been getting away with it by explaining the problem of using bits to represent repeating fractions , and then just telling attendees to convert them to strings if they want them to look " nicer . "
Summerfield :
You have to bang on about floating point issues anyway though ( and that 's not python - specific ) so that people realize these are just approximations .
Beazley : Yes .
I tell people that C and Java have the same representation — but you usually do n't see it when printing .
Chun : I just give people the link for further reading .
Summerfield : I think it 's actually useful , helps explain why using == is n't such a good idea for floats .
Laird :
Do you do a sales job at that point ?
Python actually has great answers , because it 's so much handier than in C or Java to write your own class to get the arithmetic you want , if you 're say , in Accounting .
Summerfield :
If you 're in Accounting you surely do n't want to use floats . :-)
Laird :
In a world where people use Excel to ...
Summerfield : Sure , and people think passwords are secure ! :-)
Chun : Some people switch to using decimal .
Decimal [ a built - in Python class which , among other things , makes decimal sums come out even ] .
Beazley : Speaking of floating point , I recently saw a link to some bug report related to submitting a 6,000 - digit floating point number into some kind of query related to Django .
Laird : ' Twould be fun to see a teach - off between the three of you .
Summerfield : I wonder if we 'd all teach the same things ?
Or in the same order ?
Certainly not in the same way , since our cultures are so different .
Laird : Big Stories for Python :
We 've already touched on several aspects of performance and multicore .
Are any of you directly in touch with unladen swallow or related projects ?
Do we know what the outcome will be ?
Beazley : I 'm not in direct contact with that project .
However , I did give that insane GIL presentation that tried to look at some of the multicore problems .
Summerfield : the only one I closely follow is pyqt because Phil Thompson helped a lot with the book .
We keep in touch , as he makes the Python 3 version more pythonic .
I read ( well , skimmed a bit of ) that talk , loved the bit about for how long the GIL code had been left untouched .
Beazley :
For me , the big Python story that most interests me is fixing I/O performance in Python 3 .
Laird : How about the Ubuntu-OneComputerPerChild-PythonInEducation -... stream ?
Summerfield : I 'm a skeptic about children and computers .
I think that computers will end up being seen as " cheap teachers " but I wo n't go on about teaching .
I'm a qualified teacher but I hate how " education " is done ( in England & Wales ) .
Chun : I 'm keeping my ears to the ground as far as python - in - education is concerned .
Beazley :
At the risk of blasphemy , the OLPC , education , etc. angle of Python does n't hold my interest at all .
Note Python plays an especially prominent role in One Laptop per Child , [ OLPC ] .
Chun : I have n't seen that yet , but then again , I 'm only barely paying attention .
Beazley : I think it 's great that students are learning with Python , but it 's not really my interest to develop materials or software with that in mind .
Summerfield :
In California they 're ditching school books and going for e-books .
Chun : I 'm in touch with a few people who have been nominated for posts in the US Department of Education but beyond pleasantries , have n't " done anything yet . "
Summerfield : Yes , of course it is great that children , students , etc. learn to program — especially with Python .
Chun : Vern Ceder and Jeff Elkner , mainstays at Python conferences , delivered a talk yesterday in Washington DC at the NECC .
Laird :
Are any of your books currently assigned for university classes ?
Beazley : I 'm not aware of any classes that require my book .
Maybe for some advanced University classes , but I would hope that it would only be some kind of side - reference .
At PyCON / UK last year , there were some interesting talks about Python in education .
Specifically , how classes in Java were mostly producing students who did n't want to do any more programming .
Chun :
My book is used in a few courses in colleges ... both upper - division or grad specialty courses or lower - division undergrad programming courses .
It seems that most computer science courses prefer a text like Zelle's .
Chun : I recommend Dave 's and Alex Martelli's Nutshell as pure references in my courses .
Summerfield : My Python 3 book has been reviewed by the UK " higher education academy . "
Engineers will get Fortran ; management science classes , if they do any programming , might get Visual Basic .
Chun :
Here 's a nice slide presentation I found yesterday describing Python and Computer Literacy .
Also , for us non-Manning authors , the first Python father - son book was just published a few months ago .
The title is very ( deliberately ) similar to " CP4E " [ " computer programming for everyone , " an initiative to present Python to non-programmers ] .
I do n't know if [ it 's ] intended or not ; it looks like a more " user - friendly " version of the dummies book .
Summerfield : I 'd seen that .
That kind of thing is great , but I prefer targeting grown ups since I can make far more assumptions about prior knowledge ( and teaching kids , especially in book form — if done well — ain't easy ) .
Chun : I love the Computer Literacy slides though , especially with all the famous references .
Beazley : I have to admit that I feel like I 'm part of a generational gap with respect to learning programming — being part of that largely self - taught group that came out of early PCs ( TRS - 80 , Apple II , etc . ) .
Chun :
Hey , you forgot my Commodore CBM , Pet , Vic - 20 , 64 , 128 , and Amiga !
Beazley : Actually , one thing I 'd like to hear from Mark and Wesley is their thoughts on Python 3 I/O .
I have to say , it 's the one feature of Python 3 that 's really got my ire .
Chun : you mean the new I /O package / library ?
Like replacing files , * StringIO , etc . ?
I had to change my slides a bit because file objects no longer exist .
Summerfield : Okay , it was a mistake to let 3.0 out of the door as it was .
But they 've fixed it .
( No , he means the slow speed , I think . )
Beazley :
Well , partly it is the I/O library .
But the performance of it .
Chun :
Oh yeah , that 's why 3.1 came out so quickly afterwards .
Summerfield :
Oh , the naming is annoying , no more simple " file " objects , but instead io .
Text thingys .
Beazley :
Do you think 3.1 is going to be fast enough ?
I just recently played with 3.1 .
It 's definitely faster — but still much slower than 2.6 .
Summerfield : Re speed : I just do n't know , have n't had time to test it .
Oh , that 's a pity .
Summerfield : But I still prefer Python 3 !
Because Python 3 no longer lets you lie to yourself about encodings .
You either have bytes or strings with a specified encoding , and to me that 's worth a lot .
Beazley :
The thing that worries me about I/O is that I could see that being a topic that would prevent people from adopting it .
Whether or not it 's a good reason or not .
Chun : I have n't taken any performance measurements , i.e. Python 2.6 versus 3.1 .
Laird : People keep asking , " Is your book obsolete because it 's [ about ] Python 2.5 ? "
Beazley :
My book is obsolete and it's not even out yet ! :-)
Chun : I tell them No , I 'm just not comfortable putting something in writing against a " .0 " release of any software , much less Python .
I 'll let it settle for a little while first .
Summerfield :
All our books are " out of date , " but are they still useful ?
Summerfield :
The way to stop books getting out of date is to make Python x.y an ISO standard . ;-)
Chun :
Well , I try to focus on " core language features " and do n't try to put releases against each other , with the hope that the book takes longer to " obsolete . "
For example , a third edition of my book will be both 2.x and 3.x - compliant .
Yes , at some point , we need " ANSI Python " or ISO or whatever standards bodies are out there .
Beazley : I 'm not too worried about the book being out of date .
There 's a lot of great stuff in the new edition coming out .
Chun : I can't wait to get a copy of PER4e !
Summerfield : Okay , that 's what David 's done .
But I wanted to avoid any confusion ( yes , I 'm looking forward to reading it ) .
Beazley : I have to say , the library part of the PER4e was hell .
Chun : I think Mark 's Py3 book and mine overlap the most .
There can't be that much crossing with your Qt book as I only have one small Qt snippet in my GUI section .
Summerfield :
That 's the bit I 'm most looking forward to .
My book 's focus is on the language .
Beazley : A major complication was actually the Python 3.0 bytes / unicode separation .
A tremendous amount of existing documentation ( and older editions ) are vague about whether or not they work with bytes or strings .
Chun : I spend very little time on delving into stdlib stuff .
I only tell readers what they need to do to be able to complete the exercises at the end of every chapter .
Summerfield : Wow , I do n't have any PyQt in my Py3 book .
I think the bytes / Unicode separation is a primary motive for switching to Python 3 ; it just does n't let you get away with guessing .
But there are issues .
For example , as far as I know , subprocess uses the local 8 - bit encoding and you can't change that ( I reported it as a bug ) .
Beazley :
The bytes / Unicode separation is ultimately a good thing .
But man does it ever hammer on the library .
Chun : People have Unicode issues in Python 2 all the time .
I got so fed up with it , that I wrote a blog posting just to combat it .
Of course , I did n't truly understand the real problem until I was faced with it at work .
Beazley :
Take almost any library function that manipulates " text " and it becomes a whole new thing in Python 3 .
Summerfield : Yes , and the semantics :
If you compare two strings with the same chars they might not compare as equal , and as for sorting strings ... just look at the Unicode algorithm for that ) .
Laird :
This has been an incredible conversation .
Thanks so much for talking , guys !
Lately I ’ve found myself arguing about the proper design of unit tests .
On my side I ’m claiming :
Unit tests should only touch the public API .
Code coverage should be as near 100 % as possible .
It ’s better to test the real thing than mock objects .
The goal is to make sure that the tests are as close to actual usage as possible .
This means that problems are more likely to be detected and false positives are less likely .
Furthermore , the discipline of testing through the public API when attempting to achieve 100 % code coverage tends to reveal a lot about how the code really works .
It routinely highlights dead code that can be eliminated .
It reveal paths of optimization .
It teaches me things about my own code I did n’t know .
It shows patterns in the entire system that makes up my product .
By contrast some programmers advocate that tests should be method - limited .
Each test should call the method as directly as possible , perhaps even making it public or non-private and violating encapsulation to enable this .
Any external resources that are necessary to run the method such as databases or web servers should be mocked out .
At the extreme , even other classes a test touches should be replaced by mock implementations .
This approach may sometimes let the tests be written faster ; but not always .
There ’s a non-trivial cost to designing mock objects to replace the real thing ; and sometimes that takes longer .
This approach will still tend to find most bugs in the method being tested .
However it stops there .
It will not find code in the method that should be eliminated because it ’s unreachable from the public API .
Thus code tested with this approach is likely to be larger , more complex , and slower since it has to handle conditions that ca n’t happen through the public API .
More importantly , such a test starts and stops with that one method .
It reveals nothing about the interaction of the different parts of the system .
It teaches nothing about how the code really operates in the more complex environment of the full system .
It misses bugs that can emerge out of the mixture of multiple different methods and classes even when each method is behaving correctly in isolation according to its spec .
That is , it often fails to find flaws in the specifications of the individual methods .
Why then are so many programmers so adamant about breaking access protection and every other rule of good design as soon as they start testing ?
Would you believe performance ?
For instance consider this proposal from Michael Feathers :
A test is not a unit test if :
It talks to the database
It communicates across the network
It touches the file system
It ca n’t run at the same time as any of your other unit tests
You have to do special things to your environment ( such as editing
config files ) to run it .
Tests that do these things are n’t bad .
Often they are worth writing , and they can be written in a unit test harness .
However , it is important to be able to separate them from true unit tests so that we can keep a set of tests that we can run fast whenever we make our changes .
More than 30 years ago Donald Knuth first published what would come to be called Knuth ’s law : “ premature optimization is the root of all evil in programming . ” ( Knuth , Donald .
Structured Programming with go to Statements , ACM Journal Computing Surveys , Vol 6 , No. 4 , Dec. 1974 . p.268 . )
But some developers still have n’t gotten the message .
Are there some tests that are so slow they contribute to not running the test suite ?
Yes .
We ’ve all seen them , but there ’s no way to tell which tests they are in advance .
In my test suite for XOM , I have numerous tests that communicate across the network , touch the filesystem , and access third party libraries .
However , almost all these tests run like a bat out of hell , and take no noticeable time .
The slowest test in the suite ?
It ’s one that operates completely in memory on byte array streams with no network access , does not touch the file system , uses no APIs beyond what ’s in Java 1.2 and XOM itself , and there ’s no database anywhere in sight .
I do omit that test from my standard suite because it takes too long to run .
I ’ll run it explicitly once or twice before releasing a new version , but not every time I make a change .
I am now proposing Harold ’s corollary to Knuth ’s law : premature optimization is the root of all evil in testing .
It is absolutely essential to make sure that your test suite runs fast enough to run after every change to the code and before every check in .
I ’m even willing to put a number on “ fast enough ” , and that number is 90 seconds .
However , you simply cannot tell which tests are likely to be too slow to run routinely in advance of actual measurement .
Castrating and contorting your tests to fit some imagined idea of what will and will not be slow limits their usefulness .
Tests should be designed for the ideal scenario : a computer that is infinitely fast with infinite memory and a network with zero latency and infinite bandwidth .
Of course , that ideal computer does n’t exist ; and you ’ll have to profile , optimize , and as a last resort cut back on your tests .
However , I ’ve never yet met a programmer who could reliably tell which tests ( or other code ) would and would not be fast enough in advance of actual measurements .
Blanket rules that unit tests should not do X or talk to Y because it ’s likely to be slow needlessly limits what we can learn from unit tests .
Senator Mary Landrieu ( DLC , LA ) is under " attack " in a radio ad from MoveOn.org .
I can't figure out where the " attack " is : the very short radio ad told people factual information about how much soft money the healthcare industry gave to Landrieu and also asked listeners to CALL LANDRIEU and express their opinions about healthcare .
CNN 's John King was aghast !
{emphasis mine}
... before there 's even a bill to vote on , she 's being attacked on the radio .
Should the president of the United States , the leaders of the Democratic Party tell moveon.org to save its money and get off the radio ?
So what exactly about that ad is ' attacking '
Senator Landrieu , Mr. King ?
Publicizing the amount of money she 's received from corporate for - profit healthcare lobbyists ?
Or perhaps , horror of horrors , suggesting that her actual constituents give her a ... wait for it ... telephone call ?
At least Senator Casey from Pennsylvania points out that New York Times survey showing 72 percent of the American people favoring a public option .
" I know that 's not the universal opinion in Washington , " he says .
I happen to think the silver lining in this health care " debate " is that finally that 72 % is waking up to whose interests their congress people actually serve .
Follow the money .
I guess polite Washingtonians find it distasteful to mention who owns their vote , bought and paid for , and are deeply troubled when citizens without 1.6 million dollars in donations call the office expecting to be , you know , heard or something .
Move
On emailed me recently , asking me to contact " my " representative , John " CO2 is plant food " Shimkus , who is owned by the coal lobby .
I told MoveOn I could n't help them .
since I do n't have the same soft money donations as the coal industry , therefore my lawn guy ( the one planting the grass that eats Shimkus 's CO2 ) is a better representative of my interests than my congressman .
And it 's just sick when television media plays along with this charade , indicating that publicizing soft money and promoting citizen involvement somehow " attacks " a United States Senator ?
Honestly , John King , being a media lapdog to the Georgetown Senatorial Cocktail Party
Set is no way to go through life , son .
Full transcript below the fold ... ( h/t Heather )
KING : So , Senator Casey , come into the conversation with your views .
And as you do so , Senator Feinstein , a Democrat , just raised some significant questions .
She 'd like to get this done but she has big questions .
Senator Mary Landrieu of Louisiana is another Democrat who lives in a more conservative state .
She has raised some questions .
The reward for her raising questions has been a liberal group , moveon.org , is now attacking her on the radio .
Let 's listen .
( BEGIN AUDIO CLIP )
ANNOUNCER : Why is Mary Landrieu opposing the president 's plan to provide health care choices for all Americans , including the option to join a high - quality public health insurance plan ?
She did receive $ 1.6 million in campaign contributions from the health care industry , the same industry that 's now spending millions to stop the president 's plan .
Call Mary Landrieu .
( END VIDEO CLIP )
KING : Senator Casey , is that helpful ?
That 's an ally of your party , moveon.org .
They have helped the Democrats in elections .
They helped President Obama in the election .
There 's not a bill to vote on yet .
There are people like Senator Feinstein , like Senator Lugar , like Senator Grassley .
I bet Senator Casey has some questions about this legislation .
And before there 's even a bill to vote on , she 's being attacked on the radio .
Should the president of the United States , the leaders of the Democratic Party tell moveon.org to save its money and get off the radio ?
CASEY : Well , John , I 'm not sure we can be in the business of telling groups how they spend their money .
But , look , this is very early .
I do n't think either side on this should overreact , people in the Democratic party , groups that support us , nor people in the Republican party .
There 's still an awful long way to go here .
But the reality , for a lot of families , in Pennsylvania and across the country -- I 'll just give you one example .
In Pennsylvania , if you look at 2007 and 2008 , at some period of time within those two years , more than a quarter of our population had no health insurance at all .
It 's a huge number , and the same is true across the country .
The worst thing we could do is to sit back and continue to wait and debate for too long .
The status quo , right now , is unacceptable .
I think the status quo is the enemy of reform and change .
So we have to be cognizant of the difficulty of the cost issues as well as coverage issues .
But I really believe we can get this right .
For example , our committee , the Health , Education , Labor and Pensions Committee , this week , began voting on amendments .
So the ship is moving here ; long way to go .
Senator Grassley 's worked hard with Senator Baucus on the Finance Committee .
There 's still a lot of work to do .
But the worst thing we could do , I believe , is to lose the opportunity to get something done here .
The American people expect us to be prudent .
They expect us to tell how we 're going to pay for this .
But the last thing they want us to do is to wait and delay for 2010 or 2011 , because this is the economic threat to our country .
If we do n't get this right and get it done , American families are going to pay far too much .
There are estimates , in the next eight years , the cost of health care for families is going to go up by 83 percent , by one estimate .
We cannot allow that crushing economic burden to be imposed upon families who are still struggling to get through this recession .
So I think the president was right to focus on reducing costs , enhancing quality , and making sure that people have choices
.
And I believe one of those choices should be a public option , which , in the paper today , the New York Times survey shows 72 percent of the American people favoring it .
I know that 's not the universal opinion in Washington .
But I believe we can get this right .
It 's going to be difficult , but our committee is actually moving and voting on amendments , and that 's the way it should be .
KING : I will continue to cover this issue and all the other issues , as we go forward .
I want to thank all of you senators for joining us for a long , extended conversation today .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- Chrysler and Italian automaker Fiat on Wednesday officially signed a strategic alliance brokered by the U.S. government , one day after the Supreme Court cleared the path for the deal .
Fiat will initially take a 20 % stake in the company ; its share can go up to 35 % if it reaches certain fuel - efficiency goals .
" This is a very significant day ... for the global automotive industry as a whole , " said Sergio Marchionne , Fiat 's chief executive who was named the CEO of Chrysler on Wednesday .
" From the very beginning , we have been adamant that this alliance must be a constructive and important step towards solving the problems impacting our industry . "
Fiat spokesman Gualberto Ranieri said Marchionne will retain the title of CEO of both Chrysler and Fiat .
Former Vice Chairman Jim Press was promoted to deputy CEO and special advisor ; he will be the point man for Chrysler 's restructuring .
The new Chrysler :
The deal established a new company , called Chrysler Group LLC , after the former Chrysler LLC sold nearly all of its assets to the new firm .
Chrysler Group is 55 % owned by the United Auto Workers union .
The U.S. government holds an 8 % stake and Canada a 2 % share .
Fiat will not be allowed to take a majority stake until the new Chrysler pays back the $ 22.1 billion lent to it from the Treasury Department , including Wednesday 's $ 6.6 billion wire transfer .
Chrysler 's new board will consist of three Fiat directors , four representing the U.S. government , one from the UAW and one from the Canadian government .
The company said it expects to name former Borden Chemical and Duracell chief executive as its chairman .
Marchionne said the Chrysler plants that had been shuttered as a result of the company 's bankruptcy process will be back up and running " soon , " and the company will focus on developing fuel - efficient vehicles that will " become Chrysler 's hallmark going forward . "
Jeremy Anwyl , CEO of Edmunds.com , said it will take 18 months to two years for Chrysler to begin unveiling smaller cars that have helped Fiat grow in Europe .
Even after the Fiat integration is complete , Chrysler 's future path is uncertain .
" Much of Chrysler 's future success will depend on fuel prices and Americans ' appetite for small cars , " said Anwyl .
" But Chrysler has an opportunity to look for niches that have been under - explored , as they did in the past with the PT Cruiser and minivan market . "
Not out of bankruptcy yet : Chrysler filed for bankruptcy on April 30 , and the Obama administration hoped the process would take less than 60 days to complete .
Though Chrysler sold its assets to Chrysler Group LLC , the old Chrysler will likely remain in bankruptcy for quite some time as it resolves its debts and liabilities .
" This is by no means the end of Chrysler 's bankruptcy case , " said Ed Neiger , founder of Neiger LLP , a creditors ' rights and bankruptcy law firm .
" So many issues still need to be resolved , which may take months or even years . "
The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday cleared the way for the deal after delaying the sale pending review of a case brought by Indiana state pension funds challenging Chrysler 's bankruptcy .
Those funds argued that they and other lenders deserved better treatment by the bankruptcy court .

BBC Arabic , Cairo
Apartments remain unfinished , waiting for prices to rise BBC correspondents from around the world are taking the pulse of the world economy , and this week they are focusing on the state of the property market .
In the Egyptian capital , Cairo , the streets are as busy as ever , but all around , newly - built apartments lie empty .
They are the visible sign that the real estate boom that hit Cairo and most of Egypt in the 2007 and 2008 is now over .
Prices of housing and land are now falling .
" A square metre of land has fallen from 2800 Egyptian pounds ( £ 305 ) to as low as 2000 now , " says Khalid El Sha'er , a Cairo property developer .
The newspapers are full of adverts for new apartments and the buildings themselves are often festooned with billboards proclaiming the merits of the new developments .
But still the apartments remain empty .
There used to be a boom for the housing market from 1 June when Egyptian workers returned from their jobs in the Gulf with money to invest .
But this has not happened this year .
" Prices are falling because building materials are cheaper and the market itself is unnerved by the global financial downturn .
And yet potential purchasers are still not buying because they think prices may fall even more , " explained Essam Hammad , an expert on the property market in Egypt .
There have been falls of 15 % in the luxury and upper middle - class property market in Egypt.
Stagnation
But for those at the lower end of the market , there has been no such decline .
Nour El Hady works for a small business and is going to get married this month .
He has struggled to find somewhere for himself and his future wife to live .
" Buying an apartment is out of the question for me so I have been looking for somewhere to rent .
Even then it has been difficult to find somewhere I can afford .
I was looking for nearly 6 weeks before I could find somewhere suitable , " he told BBC Arabic radio .
Mr Al Hady 's experience reflects the other side of the coin of Egypt 's housing market .
At the top end of the market , people are not buying because they expect prices to fall further .
At the lower end of the market , possible sellers would rather leave flats empty rather than sell at what they think could be near the bottom of the market .
The result is stagnation for the poor , who did not benefit from rises in property prices , and arenow failing to gain from their fall .

The Adoption Institute 's protesting the new horror movie Orphan because they believe it 's negatively influencing would - be parents .
But frankly if someone goes ahead and adopts one of these soulless dead - eyed kids who weeps blood , they 're pretty much asking for it .
Advertisement
In a letter to Warner Brothers , the Congressional Coalition on Adoption Institute 's CEO , Barry Meyer , insisted that :
" We are concerned that in addition to its intended entertainment value , this film will have the unintended effect of skewing public opinion against children awaiting families both in the United States and abroad .

Evil Esther and her sinister lines such as , " It must be hard to love an adopted child as much as your own , " have certainly pissed off a lot of people .
Some adoption agencies have even suggested boycotting the film .
Which ( in my mind ) is like candy shops suggesting the boycott of Willy Wonka .
While the Adoption Institute is protesting the film itself , I believe there is a bigger factor at play here .
And would like to make my own demands for a better and more in - depth vetting system to weed the evil orphans out of the adoption pool .
Why are innocent couples always ending up with these devil babies , and how come the government has n't done anything to stop the infestation of evil orphans ?
There needs to be a longer and more rigorous screening process .
Perhaps these questions might help ...
Can they hold a Bible without it burning their hands ?
Do they make the walls bleed ?
Do they refer to themselves as we ?
As in : " We want to take the cat swimming , we can't reach the matches , we want to play with baby brother alone in in the tree house . "
Spokesman Scott Rowe for WB released a statement to AP stating that ,
It is not a depiction of any real - life events or situations and has never been portrayed as anything but an entirely fictional story .
We apologize if we appeared insensitive with the initial trailer , as it's never our intent to offend anyone with our products .

In other words it 's a movie .
And movies are not real .
These must be the same kind of people that think they can drink gasoline and turn into a Transformer .
Come on people .

If you have asthma , you may be more likely to have acid reflux as well .
You may have both asthma and reflux if you answer yes to any of the following questions :
Do you have symptoms of regurgitation ?
Many patients will describe the sensation of acid and food backing up into the esophagus as a " wet burp . "
Some people also have a sensation that their food is always coming back up with a sense of nausea .

Some people also have a sensation that their food is always coming back up with a sense of nausea .
Do you have frequent heartburn or pyrosis ?
This is the painful burning in your stomach and mid-chest caused by acid from your stomach going up into and irritating your esophagus .
This is not only painful but can also lead to worsening asthma control .

Do you experience a sour or bitter taste in your mouth ?
Depending on the severity , the reflux may cause a sour or bitter taste , or you may get a sudden sensation of a salty fluid in your mouth called water brash .
Water brash results from the stomach acid stimulating the salivary glands to produce saliva .

Have you experienced coughing , wheezing , or shortness of breath at night in the past month ?
Unexplained nighttime asthma symptoms may indicate that you have reflux as well .
Because you are sleeping you may not be aware that your reflux is severe enough that you are actually aspirating food particles into your lungs and this may be what is causing your restlessness and asthma symptoms .
Reflux can be one of the triggers in the pathophysiology of asthma that leads to more asthma symptoms or even trigger an asthma attack .﻿﻿
Signs and Symptoms
If your asthma is poorly controlled and you are experiencing any of the following symptoms of both reflux and asthma , you may want to consider talking with your doctor .
Wheezing
Chest tightness
Shortness of breath
Chronic cough
Feeling as though food is getting stuck in your throat
Hoarseness or voice changes
Sore throat
Your doctor may also suspect reflux and asthma are occurring together if :
Your asthma symptoms continue to occur despite taking your asthma medication appropriately , or you have had a poor response to your treatments .
You experience asthma symptoms after eating foods that make reflux worse , such as a high - fat meal , alcohol , chocolate , or caffeine .
You are taking medications known to increase acid reflux , such as calcium channel blockers ( e.g. nifedipine for hypertension ) , prescription pain medications ( e.g. Lortab ) , or osteoporosis treatments ( e.g. Fosamax ) .
Your asthma symptoms began as an adult .
﻿ ﻿
What You Can Do If You Have Asthma and Reflux
There are a number of things you can do if you have both asthma and reflux .
While you can go to your doctor for a prescription or the pharmacy for over the counter meds , you can also try these techniques without a trip to the doctor :
I admit it .
I love it when the sky is falling .
There is no more delicious a state of being than the imminent threat of disaster .
During these times , I ’ve done great work .
I ’ve taken teams from “ We ’re fucked ” to “ We made it ” .
Yeah , we had to cancel Christmas that one time and there was that other time I did n’t leave the building for three days straight , but it was worth it because there ’s no more exhilarating place to hang than the edge of chaos .
We ’re wired to escape danger .
There ’s a reputation you get after successfully performing the diving saves .
You ’re “ The Fixer ” .
You ’re the one they call when hope is lost and while that ’s a great merit badge to have , it ’s a cover story .
It ’s spin .
See , someone upstream from you fucked up badly .
When the sky falls , it means someone somewhere underestimated the project , did n’t make a decision , or let a small miss turn into a colossal disaster , and while fixing a disaster feels great , you ’re not actually fixing anything .
Management by crisis is exhilarating , but it values velocity over completeness ; it sacrifices creativity for the illusion of progress .
Still , right now , the sky is falling and rather than let it fall , immediate action is necessary and my first bit of advice is that everyone takes a deep breath .
Sigh
When you see an impending crisis , your body has a distinct natural reaction .
In your consideration of the crisis , you take a long , deep breath .
You often do n’t notice this , but if I was sitting next to you , I would hear sigh .
A sigh is associated with despair .
We ’re screwed .
Sigh .
My interpretation is different ; this long , deep breath is one of preparation .
Let ’s break it down : Breathe in .
Gathering your strength .
Oh shit , how am I going to deal with this ?
Hold it .
Hold it .
Ok , breathe out .
Ok , not sure what the plan is , but let ’s roll .
The interesting part of the deep breath is when you hold it .
Try it right now : deep breath and hold it .
What are you doing when you ’re holding your breath ?
Well , first off , you ’re slowly asphyxiating , but in that moment of life - threatening tension you ’re doing interesting work .
It ’s a subtle transformation from building tension to calm release .
It can also be a deliberate moment of consideration .
You can let that breath out now .
It ’s a metaphoric stretch , but it ’s around the deep breath that I build my team ’s communication structure .
I ’ll explain , but first a story .
The team at the start - up was in a design crisis .
The 1.0 version of the product was out and doing well and everyone wanted to do , well , everything .
Every feature was being considered .
Unbridled ambition is a good problem to have for about a week .
After a month , we had three different design directions in play with various levels of support .
The creative rush of developing a new release was degrading to useless design meetings where different camps were building strategic fortifications rather than talking .
Decisions were being made and not communicated .
Confusion was replacing creativity .
In times of crisis , a few human behaviors can make everything worse :
In the absence of direction , people make shit up .
Nature abhors a vacuum and in the absence of solid information , people generate their own information to fill that vacuum .
They ’re not lying , they have no ill will , they ’re just trying to build a semblance of structure amongst the confusion .
This is only exacerbated by the fact that …
Human beings provide mutual group therapy by endlessly talking about the crisis at hand .
This is n’t the creation of new content ; it ’s just the regurgitation of the latest new .
At the right time , this hallway cross-pollination is a great way to evolve an idea , but if all we ’re doing is talking about the crisis , all we ’re doing is scratching at the worry rather than dealing with it .
Lastly , everyone wants to know everything .
Combine the communication vacuums and the group therapy creating a fire hose of additional questionable content and it ’s not surprising that everyone on the team wants to know everything .
Before I proceed , I want total disclosure .
I have something unique to add and I better get a chance to do so .
It was an information communication disaster .
There were brilliant ideas wandering the hallways , there were stickies with great ideas hanging from monitors , but in the confusion that was our communication structure , everyone was running around panicking and no one was taking a deep breath .
Three Meetings
Starting on a Monday , I imposed a new meeting structure .
Let me first describe the meetings and then we ’ll talk about the purpose .
There were three types of meetings :
1:1s with my staff .
Monday morning .
First meeting of the week .
30 minutes for the folks who are cruising .
One hour for those in crisis .
The agenda is a simple deep breath :
What are you worried about ?
Here ’s what I ’m worried about .
And discuss …
Staff .
With air from our 1:1s still in our lungs , I have my staff meeting .
Two hours , right after the 1:1s are complete .
It sounds like a long meeting , but when this meeting is run well and full of the right people , it ’s almost always over before you know it .
Staff is where we can continue to publicly worry , but Staff is where I want to turn the corner , where we turn inhale to exhale .
Ok , we ’re worried about a lot , but what are we going to do about it ?
The tone and content for this meeting vary wildly by where we ’re at in the development cycle .
If we ’re early in the cycle , we ’re talking about the state of design .
If it ’s late in the development cycle , we ’re looking at confidence in the quality .
There are three buckets of topics that I work through at my Staff and they ’re increasingly slippery .
We start with Operations ( Where are we ? ) , move onto Tactics ( What are we going to do about that ? ) , and , finally , Strategy ( No really , what are we going to do about it ? )
I ’ll explain each .
Operations —
Where are we ?
Operations topics are hard non-debatable measures .
How many bugs we do we have ?
Where are we at with hiring ?
When are we moving ?
Any hard piece of data that we collectively need to know .
No debate , no discussion , just alignment .
Tactics —
What are we going to do about that ?
Now we ’re working .
Tactics are changes , tasks , events , things we ’re going to do as a team over the next week to address the worry we found in our 1:1s .
Like operational topics , tactics are measurable , consumable things , but these are not topics we ’re reporting on , this is where we ’re taking action .
We are going to scrub every bug in the next product milestone to make sure it belongs there .
Jason is going to provide the new design by Thursday .
By defining these tactics , you ’re defining the agenda for the last meeting on my list , but we first need to talk strategy .
Strategy —
No really , what are we going to do about it ?
All of these well - defined tactics are great .
They are real work , which , hopefully by the end of the week is going to define measurable progress .
Go you .
There are some organization , product , and people problems that you wo n’t be able to tackle in a week … or a month .
Strategy involves deep changes to policy or culture .
Our quality is n’t great , so we ’re going to institute a code review culture .
Our design is all over the place , so we ’re going to define a style guide .
Strategic topics during Staff are my absolute favorite because they represent the biggest opportunity for substantive change in the group .
They ’re also the hardest to define as well as the hardest to measure .
Worse , strategic changes are also tricky to implement during sky - is - falling situations because everyone is working to prevent the sky from actually falling – they ’re intensely and correctly tactical .
This does n’t mean strategic discussions are n’t important during Staff .
You might not discover a strategic change , but just having the discussion around the idea of change will give a glimmer of future hope to those who are hyperventilating .
When my Staff meeting is done , I ’ve not only taken a deep breath , I ’ve also begun the process of calmly exhaling …
I now know what we need to do this week …
This is generally where people screw up .
They confuse the relief associated with the exhale with having a plan , with actual progress .
You have n’t done anything yet except sit through three hours of meetings and we need one more .
Look What We Built Meeting .
4 pm on Friday .
This meeting exists for one reason – to measure the tactics we defined at Staff .
Did we do what said we were going to do ?
From an agenda perspective , this meeting is a no-brainer .
The list of topics and measurements were hopefully well - defined on Monday .
Again , the content varies as a function of where we ’re at in the development cycle , but some version of this meeting always occurs on Friday .
Let ’s review the design .
Let ’s look at the bug charts .
Let ’s confirm that we ’ve made that big decision .
The “ Look What We Built ” meeting is the time to demonstrate progress , to show that even when the sky is falling , we know how to kick ass .
Invest in the Boring
It ’s not just during a crisis that this calm , repetitive meeting pattern pays off .
It ’s always .
I know you ’ve been working with your favorite designer for three years .
I know you believe you ’re totally in each other ’s heads , but this psychic confidence does n’t mean you should ever skip your 1:1 with her even when the sky is n’t falling .
Communication in a group of people is an endless exercise in alignment .
No matter how well you know your team , you can never predict where the internal dialogue of your team is going to wander .
What this meeting structure does is set organization expectations :
Everyone knows when they ’re going to get their moment to speak in private .
Everyone , whether they ’re in the meetings or not , knows the system by which a lot of information moves around the building .
Everyone knows , whether the sky is falling or not , how we ’re measuring success on a weekly basis .
Equally important to these meetings ’ existence is that they occur with obsessive robotic regularity .
Years from now , when your team has been disbanded , I want you to look at your clock at 10:15 am on Monday and think I ’ve got my 1:1 with my boss in 15 minutes .
This regularity is not a threat , it ’s not a stick , it ’s the basis for building trust in a team .
I know I have a say .
And I have n’t even told you the best part yet .
All of this structure , all of this boring meeting repetition , exists to make room for something else .
Whether you ’re designing as an individual or a team , when you ’re being creative , you need two things : an environment that encourages the random and time to live there .
An obsessive meeting schedule is an investment in the boring , but by defining a specific place for the boring to exist , you ’re allowing every other moment to have creative potential .
You ’re encouraging the random and random is how you ’re going to win .
Random is how you ’re going to discover a path through a problem that no one else has found and that starts with breathing deeply .
A few months after the release of his first application , Mr Bavage is still waiting to break even .
Part of the challenge is that his Cholesterol Coach lacks the conspicuous appeal of the many games and novelty apps that crowd iTunes most downloaded charts .
His $ 2.49 health app allows iPhone users to keep track of their cholesterol levels and provides information and tools to manage the particular lifestyle factors that influence it .
But Mr Bavage anticipates a profitable future even for niche applications like his that are presented and marketed effectively , and he expects to turn a profit within four months .
" I did an awful lot of research on it before I took this leap , " he says .
To help fund his new line of work he has a part - time job as a computer salesman , but one of his greatest challenges is preventing Cholesterol Coach from fading into obscurity .
Although the application has already earned several thousands of dollars in revenue , Mr Bavage says a large proportion of that was made when it first listed and featured prominently among the new listings .
" A new application very quickly slips off the first page and the big question is what happens after that .
Continued visibility is very hard to achieve unless you get hundreds , if not several thousands of downloads , which will make your application appear in top downloads list . "
His saviour has been Google 's AdWords platform which allows him to target his application to a captive audience .
" With Google AdWords you can adjust the bid rate and spend as little as 1 cent .
That is the reason why Google AdWords make sense .
If an application is being sold for 99 c you can't pay $ 1 per click through , " he said .
Others have tried more drastic methods to boost the profile of their wares , illustrated by a recent news report in Wired of an online advertisement that appeared to promise $ US2 to anyone prepared to give its application a five - star rating .
Another way to top the charts is to get a plug directly from an Apple executive , says Mr Bavage .
" One of the best things that can happen is someone at Apple sees and downloads the application and loves it .
So if Steve Jobs had high cholesterol , it could provide enough revenue for the next few years to fund more ambitious projects .
But for the majority of people that does n't happen . "
Another popular strategy is to slash the price of an application a few weeks after its launch .
" There is constant downward price pressure and so many apps out there that launch at $ 5 are available a few weeks later at 99 c .
This is because a lot of people see a massive peak at the start when it launches , and then downloads drops off to about two per day .
When you look at it from a monetisation perspective you have to be really careful with development costs . "
" Developers need to avoid throwing their application into the apps store and then leaving it .
I managed to avoid a big drop off by been spending time and money on marketing , " he says .
To manage the hundreds of applications it receives each day , Apple communicates with developers like Mr Bavage via email , but in spite of this the road into iTunes was fairly smooth one , he says , with the initial approval of his application turned around in just a week .
The company undertakes its own user testing for new applications and accepted his work on the basis that he fixed a bug it identified in testing .
More time consuming was the bureaucracy required to set up shop on iTunes which involved filling out US tax forms and signing off on various non disclosure agreements , he says .
He is also exploring the option of expanding Cholesterol Coach to other platforms such as the Android operating system developed by Google , but has found its development kit a little less comprehensive than Apple's .
The cost of entry is also higher with Android .
While there are only a few handsets to design for , there is likely to be a wide range coming to the market in coming months .
" In theory a developer should buy and test his application on all of them and for a big developer this would be no problem , " he says .
In the meantime he is preparing to launch his second application for the iPhone .
Called Sick of Smoking it offers support for iPhone users wanting to quit cigarettes .
Because he has a marketing background , Mr Bavage hires a software developer to code most his applications , but is also dabbling with application development .
But he insists that his understanding of the creative side of the process will be more critical to his future success .
" lt does n't matter how good the programming is or even the marketing of the application .
If the creative work is n't very strong it 's just not going to do very well , " he says .

SENT TO THE CELLS : Rachael Brown was seen drinking wine outside court and was too drunk to sentence on her eighth drink - driving offence .
A Rotorua woman on her eighth drink - driving offence has been sentenced to a year in prison after being caught drink - driving while heavily pregnant .
Rachael Brown , 38 , was seven months pregnant when she was arrested last July after dodging a checkpoint on Rotorua 's Edmund Rd .
She recorded a breath alcohol reading of 994 micrograms of alcohol per litre of breath - nearly 2 1/2 times the legal limit .
Brown was due for sentencing in Rotorua District Court yesterday but her case was stood down because the judge considered her too drunk .
'' At least you 're now in a position to understand what I 'm saying , '' Judge James Weir told her today .
She was remanded in custody overnight to sober up for sentencing today .
Brown was sentenced on two charges of drink - driving and disqualified driving , the eighth and 15th time respectively that she has been charged with the offences .
Serving jail time for similar past offences had not stopped her offending , he said .
A warrant for her arrest was issued when she failed to turn up in the Rotorua District Court for sentencing yesterday , but police in the area saw Brown near the courthouse and took her back there .
She will have to serve at least six months in jail , and will have special conditions to help her with her alcohol problem when she is released .
Brown has never held a driver 's licence and was banned in 2005 from ever having one .
The baby that Brown was pregnant with when she was arrested is in the care of a family member .

The Fiat 500 : the first Fiat car to be made by Chrysler
The first Fiat to make it to the United States via Chrysler is be the diminutive Fiat 500 .
The Italian car was introduced in 2007 , the American car was unveiled in 2010 as a 2012 model .
The styling echoes the original Fiat 500 , the popular Italian car of the 1950s and 1960s ( as seen in Cars ) — of which 4 million were made between 1957 and 1975 .
2014 updates : Respnding to customer complaints , a new passenger seat sits one inch lower , for better headroom , and has seat memory and its own armrest .
New options include a new white - accented interior and five - spoke , 16 - inch wheels on 500 Sport ; new black 16 - inch wheels on 500 Turbo ; and Beats audio .
New colors are Granito Lucente ( gray ) and Nero Puro ( black ) .
Mike V. also reported that there are now two 16x6.5 cast aluminum wheels , one standard , one $ 650 .
Black trimmed lights are $ 200 ( and require optional wheels ) .
Rear park assist is $ 250 on hatch , standard on Cabrio ; and silver is optional on Cabrio only .
The Italian car has several four cylinder engines , displacing just 1.2 liters with horsepower ranging from 68 to 74 hp ; but for the United States , the base powerplant is a 1.4 - liter engine with MultiAir ; turbocharged models are the Fiat 500 Abarth and the well - named Fiat 500 Turbo .
A four - door hatchback car to be called the Fiat 500L ( L for Large ) , based on the larger SCSS platform ( along with Fiat Punto ) , will have similar styling despite different key dimensions .
Fiat 500L will launch in Europe in five and seven seat form , and in the US with five seats .
The American version will most likely use the same engines as the US Fiat 500 .
In Europe , the Fiat 500 was the first A - segment vehicle to achieve a five - star Euro NCAP ( New Car Assessment Program ) adult - occupant protection rating .
The 2012 Fiat 500 has a new airbag system with driver and multi-stage front - passenger advanced air bags , driver ’s knee air bag , full - length side - curtain air bags and seat - mounted side pelvic - thorax air bags .
Reactive head restraints activate during a rear impact , preventing whiplash .
For 2013 , Fiat 500 gets a standard “ spotter mirror ” on all levels , black - and - red leather optional on Sport , darker tinted glass ( including on the sunroof ) , revised instrument icons , new carpet , configurable door locks ( allowing the driver ’s door to be pushed twice , instead of once , as a " lock all doors " ) , tire pressure visible in the trip computer , speed - sensitive volume on the premium audio , and heated seats optional with manual transmission .
A new , 368 - watt , six - speaker - plus - subwoofer Beats premium audio system on Sport and Lounge replaces the Bose system , and there was much rejoicing .

Use of a MAP sensor instead of a mass airflow sensor
Upgraded heating and cooling system for North American climate extremes
Redesigned driver and front - passenger seats with a new armrest and seat cushion
Easy - entry system designed into the new front seats
New steering wheel controls and revised steering calibration to increase stability at highway speed ( against crosswinds )
Revised stability control with electronic brake - force distribution ( EBD ) , anti-lock brake system ( ABS ) and traction control systems ( TCS ) to control all four wheels in response to yaw and steering input ; this system attempts to understand and carry out the driver ’s intent .
New BOSE ® Energy Efficient Series premium audio system features six premium speakers and a subwoofer

More Fiat 500 information
Roberto Giolito , head of Fiat - brand styling and designer of the popular 500 , says Chrysler will build four versions of the mini-car beginning in 2011 .
The lineup will include the standard 500 hatchback , a convertible , a station wagon and a sporty “ tuner ” hatch based on the Abarth version of the 500 .
An all - wheel - drive CUV is a possibility .
All the versions will be sold as Fiats .
Production will be done at Chrysler ’s Toluca , Mexico assembly facility .
The car fits into the A - segment but allows for four passengers .
It includes the new 1.4 - liter Fiat MultiAir® engine , state - of - the - art Blue & Me™ Handsfree Communication technology , seven standard air bags , and new quality and refinement adaptations for the U.S. market , including a new six - speed automatic transmission .
The tiny Fiat 500 coupe was crowned “ best compact car ” by Japanese Internet users in 2008 , against the equally small Toyota IQ ( also coming to America ) and Peugeot 308 .
In Japan , though , people tend to accept small cars more readily ; micro cars – powered by engines of just 600 cubic - centimeters (.6 liters ) – have been street legal for years .
Fiat ’s Multiair technology won “ Best of What ’s New ” from Popular Science .
The new engine features electro - hydraulic management of the inlet valves that helps reduce fuel consumption by up to 10 % , and provide up to 15 % more torque .
It is based on direct control of the intake air , cylinder by cylinder and stroke by stroke by reducing dependence on a throttle valve for airflow control , simply and effectively varying the amount of time the intake valves are open and the amount of charge that is let into the cylinder , particularly at low speeds or partial load driving condition – the type of driving most commuters are familiar with on local freeways .
Earlier in 2010 , the Fiat 1.4 Turbo engine equipped with Multiair received the prestigious “ Engine of the Year ” recognition in 2010 in Europe .
Unusually , the engine does not use a throttle plate , but uses valve throttling .
Fiat had considered building the 500 for the American market at its Case New Holland tractor factories , before tying in with Chrysler .
Its goal was to repeat the success of BMW 's Mini , which proved that , while Americans generally do n't care for small cars , sometimes they make an exception .
Automotive history is littered with nameplates that tried to establish a footing in America with small cars and achieved only marginal success , until they faded away : Crosley , Nash Metropolitan , Studebaker Lark , and Geo .
Three engines are sold with the European Fiat 500 : a 69 horsepower , 1.2 liter engine , a 75 horsepower , 1.3 liter diesel engine and a 100 horsepower , 1.4 liter engine with a 16 valve cylinder head .
Those engines could be mated to either a five or six speed manual transmission or a five - speed , Dualogic® sequential gearbox .
Buyers in WhatCar ?
were generally full of praise for the 500 , noting its sporty feel , satisfactory power and cruising , high gas mileage ( 50 - 60 mpg ) , and general reliability .
WhatCar ?
itself noted that the engines were lively , if not particularly fast ; the car is inexpensive ; and the interior feels high quality while engines have been reliable and safety is on the top of the supermini range .
Down - sides were a jittery ride , less than ideal handling , and limited interior space .
They preferred the 1.4 liter gas engine , which is probably the only one that will make it to the U.S .
Fiat 500 car electronics and customizations
With the optional TomTom® navigation with Blue & Me Handsfree Communication technology , a 4.3 - inch TomTom hand - held navigation unit docks on top of the new 2012 Fiat 500 ’s instrument panel , providing a large touch - screen display , simple map displays with available real - time traffic , weather , and more than 7 million points of interests .
With its direct integration into the Fiat 500 ’s interior system , the driver is able to use steering - wheel - mounted controls ; and to remove the device and use it for walking or , presumably , rental cars .
Customization is aided by 14 paint colors available in metallic , non-metallic and premium tri-coat pearl finishes , and two interior environments ( Black or Ivory ) with 14 unique seat color and material combinations for an individualized look .
A full line of authentic Fiat 500 accessories by Mopar will offer customers more personalization possibilities at their local Fiat dealership , including unique striping packages , exterior and interior styling accessories and Fiat - styled merchandise .
Fiat Start & Stop system
As of February 2009 , the Fiat 500 has a new Start & Stop system which stops the engine when the car is stopped and instantly restarts it when the driver wants to accelerate again .
The Fiat 500 Start &Stop has the highest mileage of any gas - engined 500 , and starts at US $ 14,000 ( £ 9,500 ) .
Gas mileage rises in the urban cycle from 6.4 liters / 100 km to 5.7 ( from 37 to 41 US mpg , or from 44 to 50 UK mpg ) .
Highway mileage is unchanged .
Start&Stop is based on a battery and starter able to perform a fast engine restart and to deal with a far higher number of starts than a standard system .
Sensors and control strategies manage operations , to guarantee safety , driveability and energy balance with a minimum impact on heating and other services .
Engine stop is only allowed once a speed of 6 mph has been achieved after pulling away ; to restart the engine the clutch pedal must be depressed .
The Start &Stop system can be manually activated or deactivated using a button switch .
Start&Stop will not activate in certain cases , including engine still cold , battery in low charge state , heated rear window active , front wiper at maximum speed , or reverse gear engaged .
If the engine has been stopped and the clutch pedal has not been depressed for more than three minutes , the engine can only be restarted using the ignition key .
Similarly , if the engine has been stopped and the driver ’s seat belt has been unfastened , or a door has been opened , engine restart will only be achieved with the key .
Fiat ’s hands - free telecommunications and entertainment system is standard on 500 Start &Stop , which means the car also benefits from eco : Drive , the system that allows customers to monitor and improve on their CO2 emissions and fuel consumption figures .
The cheapest fiat 500 is $ 11,936 in the U.K. and comes with a 1.2 liter petrol engine .
Fiat 500 Specifications
The 2012 Fiat 500 was built in Toluca , Mexico , starting in January 2011 .
The 83 cubic inch engine has a bore and stroke of 2.83 x 3.31 inches , and is belt - driven , with hydraulic end - pivot roller rockers .
The engine uses a cast iron block with aluminum alloy heads and bedplate , and has a compression ratio of 10.8:1 .

Being alone , of course , is not the same as being free .
And after the drugs , the sex , the squats , the art , the casual stance toward hygiene and formality , some basic questions linger : Did Mr. Snow ever escape the East Side pedigree that caused him so much anguish ?
How long does someone have to live their life before they fully possess it ?
Was he on an inevitable crash course from the start ?
IT was July 2007 , and the myth of Dash Snow had ascended toward perhaps its steepest peak .
He was married to Agathe Snow , another downtown artist , but Ms. Berreau  who declined to be interviewed for this article  was about to give birth to their child .
It was during this period that two of Mr. Snow ’s close friends died of heroin overdoses .
His own career was on fire , but he had not yet been singed by the flames .
With the artist Dan Colen and others , Mr. Snow installed a Hamster ’s Nest at Deitch Projects , a SoHo gallery .
A Hamster ’s Nest is what it sounds like , but with humans in the rodent roles :
You shred a few hundred phone books , paint the walls , then ingest enough intoxicants so that every scrap of sentience disappears .
“ It was really intense , ” recalled Ms. Snow , whose divorce from Dash was finalized this summer , though she remained close to him to the end .
“ We were all really high , and there were concerts .
It was like a whole other world , an intense moment , all these people with paper , piles of Yellow Pages , no air or ventilation and fumes everywhere .
We were already so drunk .
The iPods kept getting lost in the paper . ”
Three days later  with no clue how it happened  she woke up in Berlin .
That weekend was the end of what looked in retrospect like the innocent phase of Mr. Snow ’s rebellion .
There was notoriety , youth and beauty in copious proportions , a big show at one of the city ’s finest galleries .
Six months earlier , the New York magazine profile had traced his journey into prominence from his days as a mutinous graffiti tagger roaming the streets .

It was a story that is fairly well known by now : how at 15 he helped found Irak NY , a graffiti operation led in part by a man with the Dickensian name Earsnot ; how as a teenager he stole a Polaroid and always documented his location so as to remember it when he sobered up ; how Mr. Colen and the photographer Ryan McGinley took him on as a fellow blithe spirit and something of a muse .
They encouraged Mr. Snow to exhibit his collages of newspaper headlines , many of them revealing his obsession with Saddam Hussein , and his photographs of oral sex , nude girls , lines of cocaine being snorted off body parts .
It worked :
His first solo show was in 2005 , and his work was included in the 2006 Whitney Biennial .
We ’ve been seeing not so many good ads lately by Microsoft .

I ’ve been reading through the hot - off - the - presses , exciting 100 + page report from the Commission on Wartime Contracting : " At What Cost ?
Contingency Contracting In Iraq and Afghanistan . "
There have been several good pieces that covered the Congressional hearings related to this report , so I thought I would just post some of the more important excerpts from the report .
One general note : The Commission , which was created due to the diligent efforts of Senators Jim Webb and Claire McCaskill , has been doing some incredibly important work digging deep into the corruption , waste , abuse , fraud , etc of the US war contracting system .
The statute that created the commission " requires the Commission to assess a number of factors related to wartime contracting , including the extent of waste , fraud , abuse , and mismanagement of wartime contracts .
The Commission has the authority to hold hearings and to refer to the Attorney General any violation or potential violation of law it identifies in carrying out its duties . "
While the new report reveals some critical details about issues of waste and abuse , the general tone is very pro-contractor , which is not surprising .
However , I find it disturbing that one of the members of the Commission , Dov Zakheim , is , according to his Commission bio , a current vice - president of Booz Allen Hamilton , a major defense , homeland security and intelligence contractor with a direct stake in US policy on contractors .
Booz is now majority owned by The Carlyle Group , which has deep political connections .
In an Op - ed in The Washington Post last year , Zakheim campaigned against " More regulations and bureaucratic restrictions on contractors " and advocated for " a larger , more diversified base of prime contractors and suppliers . "
Zakheim , who was a foreign policy advisor to Bush and part of the circle of the Vulcans , is now a key member of the primary body that is responsible for investigating the industry and making formal recommendations on US policy .
While the Commission is made up of appointees from both political parties , ( Zakheim was appointed by President Bush ) Zakheim ’s corporate stake on these matters should be cause for a review of his position on the Commission .
***
One fact that jumped out at me in the report is that , at present , according to the Commission , " contracting oversight " in Afghanistan is being done remotely from Iraq .
And remember , there are 70,000 contractors ( and growing ) in Afghanistan .
Here are some excerpts from the report , which I have categorized and in some cases highlighted or analyzed :
EXTENT OF US RELIANCE ON CONTRACTORS
Contractors are playing a key role in the drawdown of U.S. military forces in Iraq .
As military units withdraw from bases , the number of contractor employees needed to handle closing or transfer tasks and to dispose of government property will increase … preparations for this major shift out of Iraq and into Afghanistan or other areas are sketchy
As the military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan have progressed , the military services , defense agencies , and other stakeholder agencies … continue to increase their reliance on contractors .
Contractors are now literally in the center of the battlefield in unprecedented numbers .
From fiscal years ( FY ) 2001 through 2008 , the Defense Department ’s reported obligations on all contracts for services , measured in real - dollar terms , more than doubled — from roughly $ 92 billion to slightly over $ 200 billion .
In fiscal year 2008 , this figure included more than $ 25 billion for services to support contingency operations in Iraq and Afghanistan .
These figures do not include State and U.S. Agency for International Development ( USAID ) contracts .
[ T ]he missions in Iraq and Afghanistan are the first major contingency operations to reflect the full impact of the shift to heavy reliance on contractor personnel for critical support functions in forward operating areas .
Despite the key role of contractors in overseas operations , DoD lacks enough staff to provide adequate contract oversight .
The State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development also use significant levels of contractor support in Southwest Asia .
The Commission believes that a serious shortage of U.S. government civilians in Afghanistan is all too likely to trigger heavy reliance on contractors in both the short term and the long run .
THE NUMBERS
During its April 2009 trips to Iraq and Afghanistan , the Commission sought to identify the total picture of contractor support in those countries .
Officials in both Iraq and Afghanistan told us that there was no central list of all contracts providing support .
The Commission was unable to put together a complete footprint of the contracts being performed at the bases we visited .
GAO has also been unable to identify complete and reliable data on contractor personnel in Southwest Asia .
Only DoD provided data on the number of contractor personnel , but officials have told GAO that its census data were not routinely evaluated for accuracy or completeness .
There is still no clear picture of who the contractors in theater are , what services they provide , which contracts they perform , and what their support costs are .
U.S. Army Central Command ’s second - quarter fiscal year 2009 census reflected 242,657 active DoD contractor personnel in its Southwest Asia area of operations .
This total includes 132,610 in Iraq , 68,197 in Afghanistan , and 41,850 in other Southwest Asia locations .
ARMED " SECURITY CONTRACTORS "
According to a chart contained in the report , the total number of DoD PSCs in Iraq is : 12,942 and 3,321 for the State Department .
In Afghanistan , there are 4,373 DoD PSCs and 689 State Department PSCs .
As we previously reported , in the first quarter of 2009 , there has been a 29 % increase in the number of PSCs in Afghanistan and will continue to grow .
The report also raises concerns about the poor or inadequate training some of the PSCs receive , particularly Third Country Nationals hired to guard US bases and facilities : " Poorly trained and ill - equipped contractor employees providing security for our operating bases put American forces at increased risk of harm . "
In Iraq , 25,000 to 30,000 PSC personnel work for U.S. agencies , the government of Iraq , coalition governments , and U.S. contractors .
These numbers exceed the PSC census data in the table above because they include PSC support to the government of Iraq and coalition governments .
The total U.S. spending for PSCs is estimated to be between $ 6 billion and $ 10 billion from 2003 to 2007 .
Of this amount , $ 3 billion to $ 4 billion is estimated to be for obligations made directly by U.S. government agencies , and $ 3 billion to $ 6 billion is estimated to have been spent by U.S. contractors to acquire PSC support .
Regarding accountability , the report notes that the US civilian laws covering contractors are rarely enforced :
The MEJA ( Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act ) statute has been used infrequently .
From MEJA ’s enactment in 2000 through March 2008 , DoD has referred 58 cases involving PSCs and other contractors to the Department of Justice .
Federal prosecutors brought charges in 12 of those cases , and state prosecutors brought charges in one other case .
Of those , eight resulted in a conviction and five await trial .
WASTE , FRAUD ABUSE
According to the Commission ’s report , there is a severe shortage of oversight personnel to monitor these massive contracts and contractors .
The report notes that within the Defense Contract Audit Agency " overall staffing levels have remained relatively constant at roughly 4,000 since FY 2000 , even though DoD contract transactions have increased by 328 percent — from 304,500 in FY 2000 to over 1.3 million in FY 2006 . "
Through fiscal year 2008 , the DCAA has taken exception to over $ 13 billion in questioned and unsupported costs associated with the efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Inadequate oversight , combined with poorly written statements of work , lack of competition , and contractor inefficiencies have contributed to billions of dollars in wasteful spending .
The drawdown of U.S. forces in Iraq brings the risk of more waste .
Money is being wasted on completing projects that are no longer needed .
And poor control of U.S. government property in Iraq that must be moved , handed over to the Iraqis , or scrapped could cause even more waste .
Without proper oversight , the government cannot confirm that contractors are performing in accordance with contract requirements , cannot support payment of award or incentive fees , cannot support the certification of invoices for services performed , and cannot ensure that services critical for the completion of our military and reconstruction missions are performed .
Any one of these conditions invites waste and abuse .
Taken together , they are a perfect storm for disaster .
CONTRACTORS " SELF - POLICING "
The Defense Contract Management Agency " told the Commissioners that contractor ‘ self policing ’ had been tried , but ‘ did not work out . ’"
Some contracts are actually being " monitored " by investigators physically located in the United States .
While the Commission asserts there have been improvements in contractor oversight in Iraq , the system in Afghanistan " is very different and raises significant concerns about contracting for certain functions generally performed by the government . "
Similar to what happened in Iraq , a contractor was hired to monitor contractors as part of the Armed Contractor Oversight Division ( ACOD ) .
The company that won the contract is Aegis , the British - owned firm headed by famed mercenary Tim Spicer .
According to the report , ACOD is " primarily staffed " by the company :
Aegis ’s work raises heightened inherently governmental concerns because the ACOD receives limited U.S. government supervision .
Since its establishment , ACOD in Afghanistan has primarily been run by contractor personnel from Aegis .
Aegis ’s responsibilities include working with the Afghan Ministry of Interior in investigations concerning PSC escalation - of - force incidents .
CJTF - 101 submitted an expedited request for four field - grade officers for ACOD ; however , as of mid-May the request had yet to be approved and there were still no senior U.S. military officials assigned full - time to the directorate .
A review of the Aegis contracting documents showed that without these military officers in place , Aegis is in a role of significant official responsibility in reviewing activities of other private security contractors .
According to the report , " DoD interviewees informed the Commission that sufficient military manpower and / or expertise did not exist in Afghanistan , and that contracting with Aegis allowed the Combined Joint Task Force ( CJTF - 101 ) to obtain expertise quickly .
Aegis does not currently provide armed contractors in Afghanistan , and as the ACOD is currently structured , an Aegis contractor serves as the Deputy Director and has day - to - day responsibility for managing the directorate .
Should they be awarded a PSC contract under the current structure , there would be a conflict of interest . "
KBR
The Commission believes that the services provided by contractor KBR under LOGCAP III — with $ 31.4 billion funded through March 20 , 2009 — could have been delivered for billions of dollars less .
DCAA is reviewing $ 277 million in LOGCAP III subcontracts involving KBR employees or ex-employees that have been or may have been involved in improper procurement activities .
The purpose of DCAA ’s review is to assess the reasonableness of payments under those subcontracts .
The report notes that KBR is still firmly entrenched in the latest LOGCAP contract :
LOGCAP IV , the fourth iteration of the program , is a multiple - award contract competitively awarded in April 2008 to DynCorp International LLC , Fluor Intercontinental , and KBR Services .
Each contractor can receive up to $ 5 billion of work under the contract in a given year , so total spending over the possible 10 - year life of the contract could be as high as $ 150 billion .
Meanwhile , work contracted under LOGCAP III continues , so a slow segue from one contract to another is under way .

Enlarge By Saul Loeb , AFP President Obama 's budget , released in February , calls for letting tax cuts for top earners enacted at the beginning of the decade expire in 2011 .
WHERE TAX RATES KICK IN WHERE TAX RATES KICK IN WASHINGTON 
Three tax increases proposed by President Obama and House Democrats on the richest Americans could produce the highest tax rates in a quarter - century .
The latest is this week 's proposal by House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Charles Rangel , D - N.Y. , and others to impose a surtax of up to 5.4 % on annual incomes of $ 350,000 or more to help pay for overhauling the health care system .
About 500,000 taxpayers earning $ 1 million or more would pay the full surtax .
RECESSION WATCH : Tracking the economy ; see VIDEO Obama 's budget , released in February , calls for letting tax cuts for top earners enacted at the beginning of the decade expire in 2011 .
That would raise the top rate from 35 % to 39.6 % on incomes above $ 373,000 .
During the presidential campaign , Obama favored bolstering Social Security by subjecting family income above $ 250,000 to the 12.4 % payroll tax , paid equally by employees and employers .
The tax currently is levied on income up to $ 102,000 .
All told , shifting the cost of health care , Social Security and other budget priorities toward high - income Americans would mean an actual tax rate above 45 % for the wealthiest — " levels never seen , " says Clint Stretch , a tax expert at Deloitte Tax LLP .
When top rates were higher , tax shelters helped reduce the percentage of income paid .
White House press secretary Robert Gibbs said this week that Obama " believes that the richest 1 % of this country has had a pretty good run of it for many , many , many years . "
The top 1 % had income of $ 557,000 or more , according to the non-partisan Tax Policy Center .
Relying on top earners to pay for benefit programs risks reversal if Republicans return to power , says William Gale of the Brookings Institution , a think tank .
" We can not do this on the backs of the rich , " he says .
Robert McIntyre of the liberal Citizens for Tax Justice says Obama eventually must look beyond the 6.4 million taxpayers earning $ 200,000 or more .
" At some point , you just can't squeeze them anymore , " he says .

An Urbandale man involved in a standoff with Polk County deputies Monday died Tuesday morning .
After negotiation attempts failed , deputies shot 21 - year - old Justin Schleuning with a bean bag gun .
The rounds were meant to stun him , but wound up killing him
[ efoods ] About 1:16 AM Monday , dispatchers received a call from Schleuning .
He told deputies he had a loaded gun and wanted to kill himself .
Authorities traced his call to the 300 block of NW 74th Avenue just south of Ankeny .
“ A little after four that same morning , he did exit his vehicle .
Less than lethal munitions were deployed and he was taken to the hospital , ” says Jana Rooker from the Polk County Sheriff ’s Office .
“ I do n’t like the term less lethal , ” says Gil Hansen , a firearms training and defensive tactics instructor at the Iowa Law Enforcement Academy .
He says so - called bean bag guns can safely diffuse a situation .
“ They can subdue a person without deadly force and because they are n’t intended to cause death or bodily injury , ” he says .
But the danger is still there .
Filled with birdshot and fired from a 12 gauge shotgun , the weapon still packs a punch .

Judge : Ex -Bush lawyer can be sued over torture Padilla torture lawsuit
File -

Justice Department officials have stopped short of recommending criminal charges against Bush administration lawyers who wrote secret memos approving harsh interrogation techniques of terror suspects .

A prisoner who says he was tortured while being held for nearly four years as a suspected terrorist can sue former Bush administration lawyer John
Yoo for coming up with the legal theories that justified his alleged treatment , a federal judge in San Francisco ruled Friday .
U.S. District Judge Jeffrey
White 's decision marks the first time a government lawyer has been held potentially responsible for the abuse of detainees .
" Like any other government official , government lawyers are responsible for the foreseeable consequences of their conduct , " White said in refusing to dismiss Jose Padilla 's lawsuit against Yoo .
If Padilla , now serving a 17 - year prison sentence on terrorism charges , can prove his allegations , he can show that Yoo " set in motion a series of events that resulted in the deprivation of Padilla 's constitutional rights , " White said .
White , an appointee of former President George W. Bush , noted that Padilla 's lawsuit accuses
Yoo of helping to design administration policy on detention and torture , and then crafting legal opinions to justify it - stepping outside the usual role of a lawyer .
Yoo , a UC Berkeley law professor , was an attorney in the Justice Department 's Office of Legal Counsel from 2001 to 2003 and wrote a series of memos on interrogation , detention and presidential powers .
The best - known memo , written to then - White House Counsel Alberto Gonzales in 2002 , said rough treatment of captives amounted to torture only if it caused the same level of pain as " organ failure , impairment of bodily function or even death . "
The memo also said the president may have the constitutional power to authorize torture of enemy combatants .
' Any means necessary '
A 2001 Yoo memo , made public by the Obama administration , said U.S. military forces could use " any means necessary " to seize and hold terror suspects in the United States .
Yoo could not be reached at his Berkeley office Friday .
A spokesman for the Justice Department , which is representing him and has argued for dismissal of the suit , was unavailable for comment .
Padilla 's lawyers issued a statement saying they are " pleased that our client will get his day in court and the right to challenge the unconstitutional conduct to which he was subjected . "
Unique ruling
John Eastman , law school dean at Chapman University in Orange County , where Yoo taught for the past year , said the ruling is unique - the first to hold any administration official potentially liable for alleged mistreatment of terrorist suspects .
Eastman predicted that the Justice Department will file an immediate appeal , going to the Supreme Court if necessary .
Padilla , a U.S. citizen , was arrested in Chicago in 2002 and accused by the Bush administration of plotting with al Qaeda to detonate a radioactive " dirty bomb . "
Declared an enemy combatant , Padilla was held in a Navy brig for three years and eight months and was denied all contact with the outside world for the first half of that period , his suit said .
He was then taken out of the brig and charged with taking part in an unrelated conspiracy to provide money and supplies to Islamic extremist groups .
He was convicted and has appealed .
His suit against
Yoo covers his time in the brig .
He says he was detained illegally , held for lengthy periods in darkness and blinding light , subjected to temperature extremes and sleep deprivation , confined in painful stress positions , and threatened with death to himself , harm to his family and transfer to a nation where he would be tortured .
Claims of mistreatment
The suit said Yoo - who has acknowledged being a member of an administration planning group known as the " war council " - personally reviewed and approved Padilla 's detention in the brig and provided the legal cover for his treatment .
At a hearing in March , Justice Department lawyer Mary Mason told
White that courts had no power to scrutinize high - level government decision - making , especially in wartime .
But White said Friday that Padilla had a right to sue " the alleged architect of the government policy " on enemy combatants .
He said an examination of Yoo 's publicly disclosed writings would not damage national security , and an inquiry into " allegations of unconstitutional treatment of an American citizen on American soil " would not affect foreign relations .
Working its way to 1 Billion users , Facebook just reached the one quarter billion mark ( 250 Million ) , only three months after reaching its last milestone of 200 million in April .
So with such exponential growth , why is there so much talk about people leaving this social network ?
On July 15 , 2009 , Mark Zuckerberg , founder and CEO updated the company blog with the following announcement :
" So today as we celebrate our 250 millionth user , we are also continuing to develop Facebook to serve as many people in the world in the most effective way possible .
This means reaching out to everyone across the world and making products that serve all of you , wherever you are — whether through Facebook Connect , new mobile products and the other things that we are building .
We 're grateful to have all of you with us , and we look forward to helping connect the next quarter billion people on Facebook . "
Facebook claims that 70 percent of its users are outside the U.S. and that the site is available in 50 languages .
The fact that it has such a large , and dedicated , user - base makes it a dream for advertisers .
Add to the fact that users spend more than 5 billion minutes per day and the fastest demographic is those 35 years and older and you have the holy grail of target markets .
Facebook does not disclose revenue , but has said it expects to grow 70 percent this year .
Board member Marc Andreessen recently said that Facebook could grow revenue from more than $ 500 million this year to billions within five years .
So with all this good news , what 's all this ' Facebook Revolt ' talk ?
In April , the cover story of New York Magazine told of people leaving the site for a variety of reasons - disagreement with the terms of service , distaste with the greed factor as Facebook begins to monetize the site and general uneasiness about revealing so much of one 's personal data online .
In a quick recovery , Zuckerberg made a bold move .
He turned the site into a democracy .
by reinstating the former TOS and revoking Facebook 's rights to user content when one deletes an account .
So what other turn - offs are bubbling up at Facebook ?
Well , for a social network that emerged from the hallowed halls of Harvard and a skewed younger demographic are we witnessing a slowexodus of the core group .
According to iStrategyLabs , from January to July of 2009 , the population of members over the age of 55 grew 513.7 percent with 16.5 percent fewer high - school users , and 21.7 percent fewer college users .
Which naturally begs the question , where have all the cool kids gone , and is this the beginning of the end for the once - ultra - hip - hang - out site ?
Is Facebook going through an identity crisis ?
After all , when you think about it , what teen or young adults ( 13 to 24 - year - olds ) want to hang out with their parents ... or worse yet ... grandparents ?
But face it , while five years might not seem like a long time , in social networking years , it is a very long phase in the digital life of a social network .
And over time , kids lose interest and rebel because it is their right of passage .
If any one group can relate to that fact , it is the Boomers who were the most restless and rebellious generation to emerge since the 1920s .
It 's however ironic that the generation that fought the status quo are now making Facebook their commonplace habitat and are displacing their children in the process .
So while Facebook continues to reach milestone after milestone , it might be wise for that 25 year - old billionaire who started the company to rethink how he is going to replace the drop - offs to maintain future growth !
Or has he lost touch with his core constituency ?
Would n't be the first time , Zuckerberg bit off the hand that feeds ( see previous blog on ' Facebook , the Movie ' to learn more about Mr. Zuckerberg 's questionable beginnings ) .

Ian Button had a terminal illness
A man has admitted supplying a gun to his father , who then shot himself dead at Northampton General Hospital .
The town 's crown court heard how Guy Button , 30 , of Princes Risborough , Buckinghamshire , took the World War II gun to his father 's ward on 20 October .
Ian Button , 63 , who had been told he had a terminal lung disease , used the weapon to shoot himself in the head in full view of the other patients .
His son pleaded guilty to six offences , including transferring a firearm .
Button , of Wycombe Road , also admitted possession of a firearm .
He will be sentenced later .
' Ridiculous story '
The court heard Button had arrived on his father 's ward with a bag containing the gun and 19 rounds of ammunition .
Emergency staff tried to resuscitate Mr Button , of Tattersall Close , Parklands , Northampton , but he died shortly after shooting himself .
Mr Button 's 63 - year - old wife Christine was in a care home with Alzheimer 's disease at the time .
The court heard that Mr Button left a suicide note addressed to police , in which he claimed that he had taken the gun to the hospital .
Prosecuting barrister Alex Bull said : " In ( police ) interview , Guy Button said his father was becoming increasingly demotivated by his illness and was given a terminal diagnosis in 2008 .
" He said he believed the gun was decommissioned and was not live .
" He said his father indicated his plan was to hand both the gun and the ammunition to police . "
But Judge Richard Bray dismissed Button 's account .
He said : " This sounds incredible and ridiculous that he was taking the gun into hospital so someone at the hospital could take it to the police . "
Luke Blackburn , defending Button , said his client admitted he had " misguidedly " given the gun to his father .
Editor ’s note : I recorded this as a podcast long after I originally published this post .
I hope you enjoy it , and if you ’d like to hear more episodes of our Productive Flourishing podcast , you ’ll find them in the Show ’s archives .
Canvas your half - done creations , whether they are chapters half - written , paintings half - painted , business ideas half - formulated , or programs half - coded .
How many of them are stuck at roughly the same spot ?
I ’ll bet that spot is where you started thinking about how you were going to sell or share that creation .
I ’ll wait here while you think about it …
Okay , we ’re back .
Let ’s take a step back into why you started the creative process in the first place .
Chances are , it probably had nothing to do with how you were going to share or sell the idea – it probably had everything to do with the fact that you were interested in playing with the idea .
Something about the possibility of the idea dialed into that curious part of you and beckoned to be made into reality , and the rush from being in that nexus of possibility and actuality kept you immersed there , tugging at the conceptual ether like a midwife coaxing a newborn into the light of day .
But somewhere in the process , things got tangled .
You labeled the idea and determined whether it would be sellable , or good , or bad , or worth the time , and the unseen cords you were pulling slipped through your grasp .
Instead of coaxing the idea , you were left trying to pull it with no solid ground to stand on .
Sigh .
This is where the whole begin with the end in mind thing confuses people .
As a creative , you ’re not really creating because you ’re trying to make money or share it with people – you ’re creating because you enjoy creating .
Let me say that again : the end of creating art is creating art .
( For simplicity ’s sake , I ’m calling every creative product ‘ art . ’
If you do n’t think what you ’re doing is art , think about your most inspired moments in the creative process and think about what word pops up .
If you ’re still unconvinced , substitute whatever creative thing you do in the place for ‘ art . ’)
Furthermore , creating art also helps you develop into the type of person that you want to be .
Mind the form of the verb there : it is present tense intentionally .
Creative people are not satisfied with having created something , really – they are most satisfied when they are creating something .
That one fact alone explains why successful creative people keep creating well past the time in which it ’s necessary for them to do so ; they create because it ’s a part of what makes them come alive .
The point here is that your art is for you .
It ’s your way of playing in the symphony of the universe , and whether or not anyone wants to hear it is neither here nor there .
Create for yourself .
( Tweet this . )
“ But I ’m trying to make money from my art ! ” you object .
I ’m not saying you ca n’t sell it – I ’m saying you have to create it first .
And to create it , you have to create it for yourself .
You have to be passionate about it .
You have to be interested in it .
You have to have your moment to cherish the newborn .
Keep in mind that a ) you do n’t have to sell it , and b ) you ’ll never sell everything you create .
You may decide you want to keep it for you .
You may be satisfied from a day spent in creative play .
You may share it with someone , only to be surprised that they like it .
Who knows ?
But your art is for you .
If your art were like everything else you ’re doing , you could just write it off as something you did n’t really want to do .
But what makes it your art is that , deep down , you actually want to do it .
And , even more , you need to do it .
And the world needs you to do it .
So it ’s more than just a matter of finding the motivation or drive to do your art — you have to address the parts of your life that are keeping you from doing it .
Go back and review those half - baked ideas .
Put a sign , physical or otherwise , on them that says “ Not For Sale ” or “ Just For Me . ”
Give yourself room to play .
See what happens , but remember why you ’re creating and who you ’re creating for .
If you do n’t know how to move forward on your creative project , or do n’t know how to narrow down which one you ’d like to pursue first , Start Finishing will help you get from your idea to done .
In it , we address how to make space for it , how to fit it into your schedule , and how to finish strong .
Now get to it !
You need your art just like the world needs your art .
( Thanks to Sarah Marie Lacy for reminding me of this and inspiring this post .
I appreciate the conversation ! )
Market Deceptions
Happy days are here again !
Enjoy them while they last …
“ Optimism builds , ” says a headline in the Financial Times .
As predicted , the world markets are enjoying a bounce .
People who had no idea there was anything wrong with the world financial system two years ago , now say the problem has been fixed .
Who fixed it ?
The people who had no idea what was wrong with it , of course .
What did they fix it with ?
The same thing that caused the problem they did n’t see – debt .
Who makes sure it wo n’t break again ?
The people who did n’t notice the wheels coming off the last time .
Yesterday , the Dow rose 214 points .
Oil closed over $ 54 .
Gold ended the day over $ 900 .
And dollar sank to $ 1.33 per euro .
Most interesting … bond yields , though still pathetically low , are rising .
The U.S. 10 - year note yields more than 3 % .
The long bond yields more than 4 % .
The longer these trends go on , the more reasons people will find to believe that it is not just a bounce … but another major boom .
New York - based Economic Cycle Research Institute says , “ The U.S. is on the cusp of a growth rate cycle upturn , ” the article explains .
Let ’s look at whether this optimism is justified .
On the housing front … U.S. houses are down 30 % from their highs .
The Case - Shiller index of housing prices has fallen for 30 months in a row .
Is n’t that enough ?
Maybe .
The latest data shows more sales – of new , as well as existing houses .
And there are more housing starts too .
But in the former boomiest states – California , Nevada and Florida – about half the sales are of foreclosed properties .
These properties are hitting bargain prices … but pulling down the value of the entire housing stock .
And there are still lots of houses to sell .
So do n’t expect any major turnaround in prices .
If prices have hit bottom – which we doubt – gains are likely to be very small … and they ’ll come very slowly .
When the housing crisis began , we estimated that prices needed to come down about 40 % in order to make the average house affordable by the average person .
But that was before the average person ’s income came down .
If the depression continues , as we think it will , house prices should come down a further 10 % to 20 % .
Besides , if the United States is entering the “ worst downturn since the Great Recession , ” who will have the money to buy a house ?
But that ’s the issue .
Maybe the world is not entering a major downturn , after all .
Maybe it was just a case of mass hysteria…a panic , like the Y2 K bug…or terrorism …or swine flu .
Maybe people are now getting over it …and getting back to business , just like they did before .
Consumers are becoming bolder .
Consumer confidence measures are about 20 % below the baseline metric of 1985 … but that ’s a big improvement ; they had been nearly 40 % below the ’ 85 standard .
There is some evidence that consumers are returning to their bad habits , too .
Consumer spending is picking up – at least , that ’s what recent numbers from the discount stores show .
They ’re taking up cheap thrills and necessities again .
But luxury shops are still reporting drops of about 20 % per year .
Major stock markets have rebounded 20 % and more .
But the real excitement has come in emerging markets .
A few months ago , it looked as though China would be unable to decouple from the developed world .
They were stuck , said analysts , like a rusty sink drain .
The Middle Kingdom was headed towards recession just like everyone else .
But then those clever Chinese seem to have found a wrench big enough to pop the joint .
Almost unbelievably , China seems to have pulled off the much desired “ V - shaped recovery . ”
Instead , of contracting , China ’s figures show it expanding at a more than 8 % rate .
China might be lying , of course .
It seems very unlikely to us that China could have recovered so quickly .
This is not a recession , we keep saying .
It ’s a depression .
And depressions demand structural changes – the kind that takes time .
Besides , eyewitness reports tell a story that sounds like a cross between “ Grapes of Wrath and a repeat of Mao ’s Long March . ”
That is Elliot Wilson ’s description after a recent trip into the heartland of the communist giant .
More on this below , but first , we turn to Addison to see what ’s driving the S&P rally :
“ Ariba !
Cinqo de Mayo herald ’s big news for the S&P 500 this morning :
The S&P 500 is now registering a small gain for the year , ” writes Addison in today ’s issue of The 5 Min. Forecast .
“ After a manic 36 % bounce from its March lows , the S&P 500 has turned positive for 2009 .
It ’s now sitting on a whopping 0.4 % gain , thank you very much .
“ But before you down the Cuervo Gold and shimmy onto the parquet for a hat dance … consider this :
“ The resurgence in the S&P 500 is being driven by only three sectors : Consumer discretionary , materials , and tech .
See for yourself .
“ It ’s hard to believe in a ‘ bull market ’ when 2/3s of the players are in the red .
“ We ’re taking a closer look at tech , but for the time being – as if you need another reason to turn off CNBC – healthcare , utilities and consumer staples , the classic refuge for mainstream money managers are n’t such a good choice during this sucker ’s rally . ”
And back to Bill , with more thoughts :
“ Once - bustling malls are now empty , ” Wilson continues .
“ Plaza 66 in Shanghai , owned by Hong Kong - listed Hang Lung Properties , is a case in point .
On a Friday afternoon , the 51,700 square meters of high - end retail space boasted exactly 11 customers …
“ Everywhere ’s the same .
I talk to the concierges of Shanghai ’s leading hotels , always men in the know .
At the JC Mandarin , occupancy is at 40 percent in early February , against 80 % a year ago .
At the vast JW Marriott , it ’s even worse ; just 25 % … ”
Office complexes too are “ empty , empty , empty … Gemdale … 50 floors of office space completed last summer are all empty … ”
But what the heck ?
Maybe we ’re wrong .
Maybe China is already recovering .
It may be a structural depression – but only for the developed countries , particularly the United States .
Maybe it ’s only a recession for China .
And maybe it ’s over .
Seems almost unbelievable … but now , with so many wonders to wonder about we wonder why we bother to wonder at all .
Besides , other developing economies are reporting the same things – increases in exports after a catastrophic collapse at the end of the last year .
You can measure the collapse easily just by looking at the Baltic Dry Index – which keeps track of bulk shipping rates .
It fell by more than 90 % last year .
From its low , it ’s doubled – up 100 % .
But that still leaves it down 80 % from a year ago .
Stock markets in emerging markets show similar increases .
Brazil ’s stock market is up almost 90 % from its low .
South Korean stocks are up 71 % .
And Chinese stocks – those listed on the Shanghai exchange – have gained 50 % .
Apparently , someone thinks the worst is over .
Maybe that person is right .
But we doubt that this rebound is the sign of a new , healthy boom .
Credit expanded for half a century .
The Bubble Epoch at its end caused trillions of dollars worth of errors .
Many of those errors have already been corrected .
But the economy the bubble built remains unreconstructed .
Same mismanaged companies … same mismanaged regulators … same mismanaged banks .
Exporting nations had gotten into the habit of earning net sales from the U.S.A. of $ 2 billion per day .
Those earnings provided much of the speculative capital that created the Bubble Epoch prices .
But that money has all but disappeared .
And there ’s not much chance that it will return anytime soon .
Instead of a healthy new boom , our guess is that the world is enjoying a sick echo of the old one .
Governments , led by the U.S.A. , attempt to reinflate the bubble with guarantees and giveaways equal to an entire year ’s annual output of the world ’s largest economy .
Since every penny of this money is borrowed , it makes sense that every penny will have to be withdrawn from the world economy at some point .
In fact , economists are already looking ahead to the moment when deflation fears give way to inflation fears .
“ Inflation Nation , ” is the title of an editorial in today ’s International Herald Tribune .
In it , Alan Meltzer argues , “ If President Obama and the Fed continue down their current path , we could see a repeat of those dreadful inflation years [ the 1970s ] . ”
Professor Meltzer reminds us that cutting off the inflation of the ‘ 70s was n’t easy .
The feds turned the screws … and let the prime rate go above 21 % .
Of course , today ’s Fed has this information .
And Paul Volcker , who was Fed chairman during that period , is now an economic advisor to Barack Obama .
Still , “ I do not worry about their knowledge or technical expertise , ” continues Mr. Meltzer , “ What I doubt is the commitment of the administration and the autonomy of the Federal Reserve … Under Bernanke , the Fed has sacrificed its independence and become the monetary arm of the Treasury … ”
“ The Fed ’s job is to take the punch bowl away , ” said an Eisenhower era chief .
But we have come a long way since the Ike and Dick years .
This time , the inflationary party is likely to get out of control , happy days will be here for a while …and then some very sad days are likely .
Until tomorrow ,
Bill Bonner
The Daily Reckoning
A secured website is one that is hosted by a secure web hosting provider .
In such sites , the visitors gain access by using the SSL - Secured Layer Protocol .
SSL is the standard technology utilized for encrypting data which sent between a site and the customer ’s browser .
Such encryption acts as a veil and protects both the user and the customer from hackers and malware .
A ‘ private key ’ is issued to the owners of sites which gives them sole facility to decrypt the data .
Without the key , hackers will not able to encrypt it even if they get access to the data .
Visitors to such sites are welcomed with an SSL certificate on the pages of the site .
This assures that all the dealings are protected by the encryption process and a reputation among users .
Another feature provided by the secured hosting providers is the inclusion of ‘ s ’ in ‘ http ://’ as ‘ https ://’.
Internet savvy users look out for ‘ s ’ in the domain frequently even before clicking on a link or typing into a browser .
Who Uses Secure Hosting - SSL Hosting
Privacy is the vogue word for today ’s customers .
Online privacy makes the user spread awareness about security and measures involved around it .
Businesses also use secured hosting to bank on customer ’s safety .
Along with the two above given measures , the customer prefers a company that ensures to secure data .
They even ignore the cost or feature - rich factors when it comes to the question of security .
All e-commerce businesses use secured hosting : trading , government offices , insurance companies , schools etc .
Data includes personal information – name , address , birth date , monetary information – credit card number , credit report data , loans , private correspondence – requests , private health / education communications , emails , instant messaging and live chat .
Comparing SSL Certificates
All secure hosting companies offer SSL certificate , usually free with signup , and all the armour it promises .
Most secured hosts require a client to have a unique IP address and have a separate SSL certificate for each subdomain .
Even the difference between https://ananova.com and https://ananova.com
( without www ) would require two separate SSL certificates .
Others permit a “ wildcard ” SSL certificates to cover all subdomains for an entire domain .
This is an important distinction of SSL certificates to be conscious of : between shared and private certificates .
Just as they sound , a shared SSL certificate is shared with other users on that same server network ; a private SSL certificate represents a domain or subdomain protected not only on a secure server , but a dedicated server shared with no other users .
Secured Hosting Providers
Customers are mostly concerned about their information to be safe and protected and promising about this security may be the focal cause of success .
Various secured hosting providers entice with various plans and also provide bandwidth and disk space along with the secured platform .
If hosting plain contains all these features then one should grab a deal today !
There are many authorities that are entitled to issue SSL certificates .
It is still the site owner who needs to prove that the hosting is done on a secured server in order to receive the certificate .
Customers will get best secure web hosting providers in the USA .
KaZaA is back ... but only in name .
The former illegal music P2P paradise has relaunched as a legit subscription music service that offers unlimited streams and downloads for a flat monthly fee .
For $ 19.98 per month , music listeners in the US can grab as many tracks as they want from major and independent artists .
But as usual , the new KaZaA offers nothing unique over the plethora of other music services online , and its limitations will keep it from ever becoming popular .
KaZaA as a P2P service has been dead for a number of years now after the music and movie industries tried to sue KaZaA 's parent company into oblivion .
Sharman Networks ended up settling the lawsuits with a number of music publishers , MPAA , RIAA , and IFPI , but not before shelling out something in the neighborhood of $ 150 million and closing operations .
Now , KaZaA is back as a monthly subscription service .
It only functions in the US for the time being and only works under Windows , as the files are Windows Media DRMed .
The music is playable on up to three authorized PCs and apparently zero portable music players ( according to the site 's new About page ) , though you can download an unlimited number of ringtones to a single cell phone of your choosing .
Like most subscription services , all music downloaded from KaZaA becomes inaccessible once you cancel your subscription .
With all those unique and attractive features , it 's hard to believe users are n't banging down the servers over at KaZaA trying to get a piece of the action .
Indeed , playing around on the site ( which requires a credit card so the company can charge you after your seven - day free trial ) shows that it works exactly like every other music site out there — we were able to find selections from popular and even some independent artists , but if indie is your thing , you 're much better off heading to Amie Street , eMusic , or even iTunes and Amazon .
Or , if you are totally anti-download , Napster even offers a better selection of indie artists , based on our handful of searches .
With KaZaA , you can either choose to play the music you 've found right away or download the files to your computer .
If you choose to play them , they will authenticate through Windows Media Player and begin streaming directly from the service — we found this to be the easiest way to listen .
You can also download individual tracks or full albums , which will also be sent to Windows Media Player after you choose where to save the files .
We did n't run into any problems while testing the service aside from a little trouble finding some of the more obscure artists , but there also was n't anything that stood out to us about this new and improved version of KaZaA .
The service tries to differentiate itself by allowing users to pay for the subscription either with a credit card or attached to their monthly cell phone bills , but this level of choice is comparable to being able to use either cash or credit card at the gas pump in terms of excitement .
Otherwise , KaZaA is a very vanilla service with vanilla offerings , and , in this overcrowded market , vanilla does n't make the big bucks .
It 's clear that KaZaA is hoping that its once - dedicated followers will come back as legit customers , but it 's so late to the online music game that such a dream is unlikely to come true — those users are either still pirating music through other means or already customers of some other music store , or both .
But if you 're in the mood to give the service a spin , do n't let us stop you ; the one virtue of KaZaA is that it 's easy to cancel online when you 're done with the free trial .
At the Mises Institute today I was looking through the library and noticed Murray Rothbards copy of American Negro Slave Revolts , the 1943 study by Marxist historian Herbert Aptheker .
One passage stood out because Rothbard had marked it with heavy lightning - bolt squiggles and marginal comments like  Right ,   Good ,   Great . 
Aptheker , discussing the claim that cruelty was characteristic of the institution of American Negro slavery ,  writes :
Many , perhaps most , writers on this subject have denied this and assert , on the contrary , that kindliness [ was ] the rule under the system . …
A recent repetition of this idea urges the reader to bear in mind that owners of slaves were hardly likely to be cruel or careless with expensive pieces of their own property ,  just as most people do not abuse their horses or automobiles .
Aptheker goes on to provide ample empirical evidence to the contrary ; but first he attacks the theoretical argument , and this is the section that excited Rothbards enthusiastic approval :
[ T ]he fatal error in the above proposition is the assumption that one may accurately compare any two pieces of property , even if they be so far apart and so distinct as is a horse from a human being .
There are , however , fundamental differences .
Basic is the reasoning faculty which leads men , unlike automobiles , to compare , plan , hope , yearn , desire , hate , fear , which leads them to seek pleasure and shun pain , to spin dreams and build philosophies and struggle and gladly die for them .
Human beings , in fine , or , at least , many human beings , do possess the glorious urge to improve themselves and their environment .
And people who are beaten , branded , sold , degraded , denied a thousand and one privileges they see enjoyed by others will be discontented , and will plan , or at least , think of bettering their lot .
This was the slaveholders  nightmare .
This it was that led them to erect theologic , economic , social and ethnologic justifications for their system , that led them to build a most elaborate machine of physical repression and terrorization .
For , and here was another crucial difference , most slaves were owned as investments , not as ornaments or commodities of consumption , as are most automobiles .
Slaves were instruments of production , were means by which men who owned land were able to produce tobacco and rice and sugar and cotton to be sold and to return them a profit .
Their existence had no meaning other than this for the employers .
Profit must be gotten from these workers  whom the bosses owned  no matter what blood and sweat and tears this entailed , and the more profit the better .
When one combines the differences , then , he finds the slaves to have been not inanimate ornaments or instruments of pleasure , but thinking , living commercial investments , rational machines of production .
It may be said , therefore , that cruelty was an innate , inextricable part of American Negro slavery , for these peculiar machines , possessed of the unique quality of human beings  reason  had to be maltreated , had to be made to suffer physical cruelty , had to be chained and lashed and beaten into producing for a profit .
The latter was the reason for their existence and incorrigibility , protest , disobedience , discontent , rebelliousness were bad in themselves , and disastrous as examples .
Instead of the slaves value preventing cruelty , it was exactly because of that value , and that greater value he could produce  when forced  that cruelty existed .
( pp. 132-133 )
It occurs to me this Aptheker - Rothbard argument also raises a problem for Hans Hoppes contention that monarchs can be expected to be relatively benign because they take the attitude of private ownership toward the realms they rule .
The guardian council has been seen as siding with Ahmadinejad in this standoff .
Therefore , this development is significant .
The link that I provided is to the official english news agency of the Islamic Republic of Iran .
It is unknown what " 3 million votes affected " means .
Does it mean that 3 million total votes existed in those 50 cities ?
Does it mean that 3 million votes exist above 100 % turn out ?
Frankly , it should not matter as even if one small city has a turn out above 100 % that means that the election is a sham .

CONCEPT CARS / STRANGE VEHICLES / SPORTS CARS / BOATS & SUBS Concept Cars > Datsun 240Z Concept
The Datsun 240Z concept is the work of Lars Martensson , a Swedish design professional who goes by the alias GRID .
When he's not at work making 3d computer models for various computer games , GRID spends some of his time using his considerable skill creating concept cars independently of manufacturers and redesigning them to better suit his tastes .
The Datsun 240Z concept is one such concept .
When Nissan released the 350Z , and later the 370Z , they used the original Datsun 240Z for inspiration .
However GRID did n't think there was enough 240Z evident in their styling , so he had is own go .
This is the result .
Both the concept 240Z and the original car share an almost identical profile and the overall shape is almost a carbon copy , however the lines of the new car are crisper and cleaner .
Clever styling tricks have been integrated into the design to make the body more sleek .
The recessed headlights are laid back at an angle instead of upright , and the exterior door handles are built into the top section of the lateral air intakes .
The chrome bumpers have also been deleted for the 240Z concept and in their place is an multiframe aggressive grille at the front and a diffuser at the rear with integrated twin center mount exhausts .
Although there are no details on any proposed drivetrain the fact the concept is still called the 240Z and Datsun / Nissan used the numbers to indicate engine size , a 2.4 litre inline 6 - cylinder engine driving the rear wheels through a manual transmission would be the obvious choice .
MAKE : Datsun
MODEL : 240Z Concept

A ruling that effectively banned the Monty Python film from the city 's cinemas was lifted today .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Councillors agreed to overturn the ban so the film can be screened in September at the Glasgow Film Theatre .
In 1980 the Glasgow licensing committee decided that the film could be shown only under an X certificate at cinemas licensed by the authority - not the AA - certificate given at the time by the British Board of Film Censors .
Today 's change of heart followed a plea from the Glasgow Film Theatre ( GFT ) for that decision to be overturned to enable a special screening for the film under the 15 - certificate given by the British Board of Film Classification .
The GFT 's Allison Gardner said she is " delighted " at today 's decision .
In a letter to the committee , she said : " The film has been widely available to the general public on video and DVD .
It has been screened on terrestrial television .
" None of these events has caused widespread offence or in any way destroyed the sanctity of the church or undermined its place in our wider society . "
She said the theatre hoped to have a screening to mark the 30th anniversary of the film to which key members of the cast and crew will be invited .
Willie O'Rourke , vice - convener of the licensing and regulatory committee , said : " This is the first application we 've received to show Monty Python 's Life Of Brian since the first request back in 1980 .
" Life Of Brian has been broadcast on television over the years and is now widely available on DVD .
" The world , and people 's attitudes , have moved on in the last 30 years so I believe the committee made the right decision today . "
* Earlier this year , it was announced that a thirty - year old ban of the film in the Welsh town of Aberystwyth was finally lifted , and the following showing was attended by Terry Jones and Michael Palin alongside mayor Sue Jones - Davies ( who portrayed Judith Iscariot in the film ) .
Another massive update is hitting PlayStation Home , and it ’s coming tomorrow .
This update will feature the long - awaited SOCOM space , called “ SOCOM Tactical Operations Center . ”
This space is only part one of the two - part SOCOM hub , and the second space will follow this new one shortly .
The Tactical Operations Center is similar to the Warhawk space , in which you can plan your attack against other teams .
Players will be able to choose from all the full maps of the game , and all the game modes .
The space also pulls data straight from the SOCOM site , and posts stats on a regional leaderboard .
Also releasing with the space is a pack of SOCOM costumes for your avatar to wear .
The second part of the update will get Ghostbusters fans excited , as the Ghostbusters apartment is finally getting released .
The apartment will have three floors , and promises to be packed with virtual furniture ( will also feature the Ecto - 1 ) .
The apartment also includes a full Loot Stage Set , so you may film your very own Ghostbusters machinima .
The Loot Stage Set will feature movie props , as well as portable blue screens .
Electronic
Arts will be bringing an update to the EA SPORTS Complex , with additional racing tracks , leaderboards , racing boost shop , and poker updates ( ladies can now fashion some bracelets ) .
The Golf Pro Shop will temporarily disappear from the space , but will soon reappear and be open to the public .
Also , more game - related items will be coming to PlayStation Home this Thursday , including some new Street Fighter IV stuff , and the Cole McGrath costume ( which requires that you download the demo and complete it ) .
Finally , the Killzone 2 Visari ’s Throne and the Namco Bandai Museum have been confirmed to be coming to the North American Home , just not this week .
You can expect an update on when those will be hitting soon in due time .
Stay tuned on PlayStation LifeStyle for all your information on PlayStation Home .

URUMQI , China ( Reuters ) - Han Chinese armed with iron bars and machetes roamed Urumqi city on Tuesday looking to wreak revenge on Uighurs for bloody ethnic clashes two days earlier which killed 156 and wounded more than 1,000 .
Outnumbered riot police used tear gas to try to disperse the thousands of angry protesters who flooded the capital of the northwestern region of Xinjiang .
In a sign of government anxiety about the unrest , the city ’s Communist Party boss Li Zhi took to the streets to plead with protesters to return home , and overnight “ traffic restrictions ” -- originally announced as a curfew -- came into effect to halt the violence , in which many people were injured .
Security forces intervened to stop fighting , breaking up a battle between hundreds of rock - throwing Han and Uighurs and forcing a Han mob to leave a building they stormed in a Uighur area , a Reuters reporter said .
There were no reports of deaths .
But riot police stood warily by as crowds vented their anger by throwing rocks at a mosque and smashing restaurants and shops owned by Uighurs , a Turkic people who are largely Muslim and share linguistic and cultural bonds with Central Asia .
“ They attacked us .
Now it ’s our turn to attack them , ” a Han man in the crowd told Reuters .
He refused to give his name .
The crowd were carrying an improvised arsenal of meat cleavers , metal rods and spades seized from building sites , rocks and wooden clubs , and the most extreme shouted “ kill them ” and “ exterminate the Uighurs . ”
Rioters said they wanted revenge for violence on Sunday .
Beijing has not given a breakdown of the ethnicity of the dead , but official media reports initially focused on Han victims and Urumqi’s
Han community seem sure they were the main targets in the country ’s worst unrest for years .
“ We ’re here to demand security for ourselves , ” said another protester who would not give his name .
By evening the club - wielding mobs had melted away .
As curfew came down police moved through emptying streets telling people to go home and handing out leaflets with a speech by a top regional official , Wang Lequan , calling for peace .
Xinjiang has long been a hotbed of ethnic tensions , fostered by a yawning economic gap between Uighurs and Han Chinese , government controls on religion and culture and an influx of Han Chinese migrants who are now in the majority in most key cities .
Beijing has poured cash into exploiting Xinjiang ’s energy deposits and consolidating its hold on a strategically vital frontierland bordering Pakistan , Afghanistan and Central Asia .
But Uighurs , who launched a series of attacks to coincide with the build - up to last year ’s Beijing Olympics , say migrant Han are the main beneficiaries .
There are signs that unrest has spread in the volatile region , but its remoteness and poverty meant the trouble had little impact on China ’s financial markets .
Stocks slipped on technical factors while the yuan rose against the dollar .
“ TIME TO FIGHT BACK ”
Uighurs had emptied out of the streets of Urumqi late on Tuesday , as the number and violence of Han protesters grew .
But earlier in the day hundreds came out to demonstrate against the government crackdown in the wake of Sunday ’s riots , which they say involved an indiscriminate sweep of Uighur areas .
Many were women , wailing and waving the identity cards of husbands , brothers or sons they say were arbitrarily seized .
“ My husband was taken away yesterday by police .
They did n’t say why .
They just took him away , ” a woman who identified herself as Maliya told Reuters .
They vowed continued defiance .
Abdul Ali , a Uighur man in his 20s who had taken off his shirt , held up his clenched fist .
“ They ’ve been arresting us for no reason , and it ’s time for us to fight back , ” he said .
Ali said three of his brothers and a sister were among 1,434 suspects taken into custody .
Of the 156 killed , 27 were women .

Human rights groups have warned that a harsh crackdown on Uighurs in the wake of Sunday ’s violence could exacerbate the grievances that fueled the bloodshed .
Almost half of Xinjiang ’s 20 million people are Uighurs , while the population of Urumqi , which lies around 3,300 km ( 2,000 miles ) west of Beijing , is mostly Han .
Navi Pillay , U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights , said demonstrators had the right to protest peacefully and that those arrested should be treated in line with international law .
“ I urge Uighur and Han civic leaders , and the Chinese authorities at all levels , to exercise great restraint so as not to spark further violence and loss of life , ” Pillay said in a statement .
“ This is a major tragedy . ”
The European Union also said in a statement it was concerned about the unrest and offered sympathy to families of victims .
Slideshow ( 19 images )
“ The European Union calls for restraint on all sides and for the situation to be resolved peacefully ... the rights of all those in detention should be fully respected , ” it said .
Urumqi Communist Party boss Li Zhi defended the crackdown .
“ It should be said that they were all violent elements who wielded clubs and smashed , looted , burned and even murdered at the scene , ” he told a news conference .
UNREST SPREADING ?
Despite heightened security , and a cut to internet services in Urumqi which was confirmed on Tuesday by Communist party boss Li , some unrest appeared to be spreading in the volatile region .
Police dispersed around 200 people at the Id Kah mosque in Kashgar in southern Xinjiang on Monday evening , Xinhua said .
The report did not say if police used force but said checkpoints had been set up at crossroads between Kashgar airport and downtown .
Chinese officials have blamed the unrest on separatist groups abroad it says are seeking an independent homeland , led by U.S. - based exiled businesswoman Rebiya Kadeer .
China ’s embassy in the Netherlands was attacked by exiled pro-Uighur activists who threw rocks that smashed windows , and two unidentified men threw Molotov cocktails at a Munich consulate , a Foreign Ministry spokesman said on Tuesday .
Li Wei , director of the Center for Counter - Terrorism Studies , said Kadeer had been in touch with Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama and wanted to imitate rioting that broke out in his homeland in early 2008 .
“ After the March 14 unrest in Tibet last year , Kadeer said in public that something similar should happen in Xinjiang , ” Li Wei was quoted as saying by Xinhua .
Exile groups reject the charge the violence was planned and say it was a spontaneous explosion of pent - up frustration .
Wu ’er Kaixi , a Uighur and one of the best known dissidents from the Tiananmen Square crackdown in Beijing 20 years ago , said there had been no improvement in China ’s human rights .
“ For a long time , Uighurs have been discriminated against and suppressed in China , ” he told a news conference in Taiwan .
“ So much so that we ’re almost colonized by China . ”
This is the Axixa , and here in Barcelona , we need it .
The ceramic , water - stain shaped device is a public urinal .
It even comes in pee-yellow .
Public urination is a big problem in my hometown : hordes of drunken tourists , all filled up with nowhere to go .
Bars wo n’t let you use the restrooms unless you are a customer , there are almost no public toilets ( a few porta - potties at the beach is about the size of it ) , and because the locals have some taste , there are n’t even many branches of McDonald ’s , the default public bathroom for much of the world .
The Axixa is a design by Mexican Miguel Melgarejo , and could be deployed cheaply and easily on any city wall .
Inside there is a traditional U - bend water trap leading to a drainage pipe .
The outside could actually be any shape , but a yellow streak of piss seems appropriate enough .
But would people use them ?
If you are desperate enough to pee in the street anyway , we doubt you ’d be too embarrassed to use the Axixa instead .
I just hope that the local government sees this and turns the design from concept into reality .

The deaths take the number of British troops killed in Afghanistan to 171 Two British soldiers have been killed in an explosion in Helmand province , in southern Afghanistan .
A soldier of 1st Battalion Welsh Guards and one from 2nd Royal Tank Regiment were killed on Wednesday , the Ministry of Defence said .
UK troops last week launched a major offensive aimed at driving the Taliban out of strongholds in the province .
The deaths take the number of UK troops killed in Afghanistan since 2001 to 171 .
Next of kin have been informed .
A further six members of Nato forces were also wounded in the attack in Helmand , which involved an improvised explosive device ( IED ) .
Our thoughts and prayers are with their families , friends and colleagues who feel the greatest loss
Lt Col Nick Richardson
US opens ' major Afghan offensive ' Spokesman for Task Force Helmand , Lt Col Nick Richardson , said there was a deep sense of loss as a result of the soldiers ' deaths .
He said : " We grieve for them at this very sad time .
Our thoughts and prayers are with their families , friends and colleagues who feel the greatest loss . "
An MoD spokesman confirmed the soldiers had been killed while on Operation Panthers Claw near Lashkar Gah in central Helmand .
The operation is one of the UK military 's biggest co-ordinated air operations of modern times .
US offensive
It was launched to drive the Taliban out of strongholds in and around Babaji , north of Lashkar Gah .
The news of the two British soldiers ' deaths came on the same day as the US army announced it had launched a major offensive against the Taliban , also in Helmand .
The US offensive involves nearly 4,000 US Marines and 650 Afghan troops .
The operation - named Khanjar , or Strike of the Sword - aims to clear insurgents from the region ahead of Afghanistan 's presidential election in August .
Thousands of UK soldiers under Nato command have been fighting the Taliban in Helmand since 2006 , but there has been criticism that they have been overstretched and under - resourced .

We all have our own personal reasons for expatriating .
For some it ’s the sense of freedom or independence , for others it ’s the adventure , business or financial benefits ; maybe you identify more with a foreign culture .
Then there are those of you who do it for the… scenery .
You know who you are .
Just for you folk , we ’ve assembled a list of the top countries with the hottest women .
10 . Spain
The beautiful women just seem to line up in Spain .
Those splendid Mediterranean tans tend to help too– and so do the nude beaches .
9. South Africa
There are few places where you ’ll see such a wide variety of beautiful women that ’ll suite anyone ’s particular fancy – South Africa is one of them .
And they come with a lovely English accent too .
8. Czech Republic
Top models seem to come from the Czech Republic like wildfire these days .
And anyone who ’s taken even a leisurely stroll through Prague would have to be blind not to have noticed .
7. Iran
Persian women are some of the most beautiful , strongest willed in the world , though unfortunately often overlooked due to the shroud still lingering over women ’s rights in nations like Iran .
6. Croatia
Italian women get a lot of well - deserved looks , but the ladies of Croatia are the true gems of the Adriatic .
5. India
India has a deep , intricate and storied history , and women of legendary beauty are certainly a part of that .
4. Sweden
Tall , blond and blue - eyed– is there a more quintessential archetype for the beautiful woman than the women of Sweden ?
3. Hungary
Eastern European countries are popular on this list , and Hungary sits at the crossroads of them all .
All the best traits of Eastern European women mix perfectly and find just the right balance in Hungary .
2. Japan
Asia has no shortage of beautiful women , though they may get no cuter than in Japan .
1. Brazil
Walk down any Brazilian beach and you ’ll be convinced– everyone just seems to be beautiful in Brazil .
Undoubtedly , this is the place to be if you ’re looking for the hottest women in the world .
Comments
Here ’s a quick little note that has been bugging me for a while , and nobody wants to talk about it right now on IRC .
I think the By functions :
sortBy :: ( a -> a -> Ordering ) -> [ a ] -> [ a ] maximumBy :: ( a -> a -> Ordering ) -> [ a ] -> a groupBy :: ( a -> a -> Bool ) -> [ a ] -> [ [ a ] ] nubBy :: ( a -> a -> Bool ) -> [ a ] -> [ a ]
Etc. should be replaced by On functions :
sortOn :: ( Ord b ) => ( a -> b ) -> [ a ] -> [ a ] maximumOn :: ( Ord b ) => ( a -> b ) -> [ a ] -> a groupOn :: ( Eq b ) => ( a -> b ) -> [ a ] -> [ [ a ] ] nubOn :: ( Eq b ) => ( a -> b ) -> [ a ] -> [ a ]
My argument is : the functions provided to sortBy etc. have some preconditions .
sortBy is not well - defined ( or ought n’t be ) for functions which are not linear ordering functions ; nubBy is should n’t be well - defined ( to the dismay of some 31337s ) for functions which do not encode an equivalence relation .
But the folklore is that functions are typically “ as total as possible ” , so if it wants a function of some type , all I have to do is conjure a function of that type and my output will be something reasonable in terms of that function .
On the other hand , the folklore of typeclasses is that they typically come with laws .
You need to prove — or at least think you know how to prove — some laws when you make a type an instance of a typeclass .
The On functions use this obligation to encode their precondition .
They are easier to use in a verified setting , too ; there are a bunch of standard instances of Eq and Ord for which the laws are known to hold ; map your data on to that in any way you like and the precondition is guaranteed .

I f the US were a business , bankers would have liquidated it a long time ago - except now the bankers themselves are bankrupt .
As the US and other countries around the world have allocated massive amounts of money for stimulus spending , people everywhere are hoping that the global economy will soon turn around and show signs of promise .
However , the reality is that no one really knows how long it will take or how many jobs will be created .
In the past , it was mostly low - end work that went abroad .
This time , however , the jobs are not going overseas ; they are simply disappearing from the companies .
And , in order to survive the economic crisis , businesses are not just cutting jobs , they are rethinking fundamental assumptions :
Do we need an engineer to run our Web site ?
How do we redistribute the work of laid - off workers among the remaining staff ?
What do we do to retrain people on the payroll ?
Whenever the economy improves , jobs that existed in the past may never come back .
Also , even though trillions of dollars are being used to prime economies around the world , most of that investment is going to projects that make no sense for a vast majority of white - collar workers .
For example , what can a laid - off Wall Street banker do to rebuild roads and bridges ?
Surely , you do n't expect him or her to get a degree in civil engineering , do you ?
Do you trust the banker to manage the project finances ?
Similarly , there are hundreds of thousands of fresh graduates facing a bleak future .
Their debt is mountain high and their dreams are shattered .
So , what to do now ?
For sure , a lot of people are planning to start their own businesses or thinking of going back to school .
Go to West Bengal , young man
Another option : Move to India .
Standard & Poor 's says that India 's economy will grow by 5.8 per cent in 2009 , while the Indian government is predicting 7 per cent .
Even at 5.8 per cent , India would be the world 's second - fastest growing economy - provided China can grow at 8 per cent as its government is proclaiming - and that 's exponentially better than the negative growth predicted for the US , Europe , and Japan .
Even though India shed more than 500,000 jobs between October and December last year and the export sectors are likely to suffer more massive job losses , a recent survey by Hewitt Associates shows that more than 60 per cent of companies in India are still hiring .
The same survey also shows that salaries in India will grow by 8.2 per cent this year , the best in Asia - Pacific .
While that is a pittance for Indians used to 15 per cent to 20 per cent growth , it is music to workers ' ears at a time when employers elsewhere are freezing salaries , asking staff to take pay cuts , and forcing workers to go on unpaid vacation time .
It is no wonder then that urban Indians are not slowing down .
A 14 - city survey finds the mood in India " positive . "
While the anxiety level remains high , 1 in 3 Indians is " not worried about the economy at all . "
Many companies around the world are not slowing down in India either .
PepsiCo plans to spend $ 500 million .
Universal Success Enterprises , a Singapore - based company , is injecting $ 17.5 billion in infrastructure projects such as a thermal power plant .
Norway 's Telenor is investing $ 3.2 billion in Indian telecom .
Over the next four years , Marriott International plans to build 24 new hotels in India .
Panasonic is growing from 48 company - owned stores to 100 .
Hiring binge for Indian companies
It is not just the foreign corporations that are spending money in India .
One of India 's largest business groups , Reliance ADA Group , is investing more than $ 2 billion in infrastructure projects in the Western state of Gujarat .
Bharti Airtel , the biggest wireless player in the country , is adding 17,000 rural outlets .
While there are no doubt plenty of very smart locals with relevant experience who are willing to work these days for up to 50 per cent less pay than before , the market for the right talent remains buoyant .
All kinds of outsourcing firms are looking to India for growth .
Indian Overseas Bank will be recruiting 1,200 people .
Bartronics India , a technology firm , is setting up kiosks in New Delhi and has 6,000 positions .
Insurance company LIC is planning to hire 45,000 .
South Indian Bank is opening 40 new branches and looking to hire 3,000 .
If you speak English , can take a risk , and would like to be part of the new 21st century in the making , perhaps there is a job for you , too , in India .
Indeed , catching a plane and starting a new life on the other side of the planet in an unfamiliar culture is not easy .
But , then , what 's left that 's easy anywhere anymore ?

When he first got word of Israel ’s sneak attack on the Iraqi atomic reactor in 1981 , U.S. President Ronald Reagan privately shrugged it off , telling his national security adviser : “ Boys will be boys ! ”
Would Barack Obama be so sanguine if today ’s Israelis made good on years of threats and bombed Iran ’s nuclear facilities , yanking the United States into an unprecedented Middle East eruption that could dash his goal of easing regional tensions through revived and redoubled U.S. outreach ?
For that matter , would Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu readily take on Iran alone , given his country ’s limited firepower and the risk of stirring up a backlash against the Jewish state among war - weary , budget - strapped Americans ?
Obama is no Reagan .
And many experts believe the two allies are now so enmeshed in strategic ties — with dialogue at the highest level of government and military — that complete Israeli autonomy on a major issue like Iran is notional only .
So while no one questions Israel ’s willingness to attack should it deem U.S. - led talks on curbing Iranian uranium enrichment a dead end , such strikes would almost certainly entail at least last - minute coordination with Washington .
Israel would want to ensure that its jets would not be shot down by accident if overflying U.S. - occupied Iraq , and to give Americans in the Gulf forewarning of possible Iranian reprisals .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
“ Whether or not Israel got the green light from Washington to attack Iran is almost immaterial , as everybody in the region would believe that the U.S. was complicit , ” said Karim Sadjadpour of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace .
One U.S. diplomat envisaged Israeli Defence Minister Ehud Barak telephoning Pentagon chief Robert Gates , unannounced , “ to give a heads - up and explain ” once the mission were under way .

Do you not wish you could be Instagram popular ?
Well , today I will teach you the best way to amazingly change forever the way you Instagram .
Now , imagine that it is Friday and you`ve just woken up from a sound summer - time nap .
You pull out your phone .
Opening up Instagram .
Youare surprised at what you see :
Over 738 likes on a single one of your pictures !
There , you see a flurry of likes on your pictures -- over 652 on a single photo alone .
You hop out of your bed , and head to the kitchen .
You want a drink , so you place the kettle on for some tea , and check Instagram again .
Bam !
Another 87 likes .
And here comes another message .
It`s from one of your many fans asking about your life , and congratulating you on your sixth official month of going to the gym .
As you read it , you begin to smirk .
It`s a amazingly sweet - looking person , and they love your posts .
As you begin to respond , your phone buzzes again .
Oops , another ping .
But you can_t write back_you_ve got to hit the gym .
Listen , ishwarrockphutography , most people just are not in control of their life .
Heck , they can_t even force themselves to munch a balanced breakfast , much less hit the gym .
I _m here to show you how to take the reigns of your Instagram .
Imagine if you increased your popularity by 100 % , or 1000 % ?
It`s not difficult to do , although almost no one does .
Just visit our website .
There , you will learn how to garner Instagram followers and likes like mad ... without even trying .
Automagically see tons of likes on your images just minutes after posting .
The ` Top Post` section , all of a sudden , does not seem that far away .
This is all great , but you`ve really got to put in the work to make it happen .
Actually , it is not real work .
1 . Visit https://jabbertune.host
2 . Put in your Instagram username .
3 . The three pictures you posted last will receive 10 - 15 likes .
Just like that .
Being a everyday name on that page will accelerate your growth 10x , easy .
But if you want the fame , you_ve got to reach for it .
Are you ready ?
Chow until next time "

Want to be Instagram popular ?
Ever wondered what it feels like to be an Instagram Influencer ?
Picture this :
You arise early in the morning , even before your alarm goes off .
You spring up to check your cell .
Hit the Instragram App .
Wow , you think , Over 800 likes on a single picture .
You put your super - duper soft slippers on and head to the kitchen for some coffee .
After putting on the kettle , you pull out your phone again .
Bam !
Another 49 likes .
Here comes another one .
This time it is not a like but a message from one of your followers .
They flatter you on your success and let you know they adore waking up to your content .
As you read it , you begin to smirk .
It`s a really attractive person , and they love your posts .
Within minutes , your cell buzzes AGAIN .
Wow , ANOTHER message .
You close your cell and throw it in the bag .
Time for the gym .
Listen , ishwarrockphutography , most people just aren`t in control of their life .
Hell , they can_t even force themselves to have a balanced breakfast , much less hit the gym .
My job is to take people from Instagram nobody to Insta-celebrity .
( It sounds foolish , but results don`t lie . )
Now , what if you raised your engagement by 100 % , or 1000 % ?
Truth is , it is not the most complicated thing in the world to get more .
For example , all the old pros use our website .
In just minutes after posting , you have your images piled with likes .
If you are anything like our other customers , you`ll have a great chance of hitting the ` Top Post` section in a very short time .
This is all great , but you have actually got to put in the work to make it happen .
Actually , it is not real work .
1 . Visit https://rhymbo.online
2 . Put in your Instagram username .
3 . 10 - 15 likes will be sent to your 3 most recent pictures .
Just like that .
Being a everyday name on that page will supercharge your growth 10x , easy .
But if you want the fame , you_ve got to reach for it .
Are you ready ?
See you soon . "

By By M Dee Dubroff Jun 8 , 2009 in Lifestyle Scientists now claim that traveling in space for many years will adversely affect human appearance because travelers will not be required to exert any effort to either move or keep warm .
Read on for balder , shorter and chubbier details .
“ Living without gravity would cause space travelers ' bones and muscles not to develop properly , leaving them stunted and weak .
Meanwhile , the lack of effort needed to move around in low gravity and a temperature - controlled environment would mean that future spacemen and women are likely to become pretty chubby … .
They will also have bloated faces and lose their hair because fluid would pool in their skulls and there would be no need for insulation from the cold . ”
Launched earlier this year , the Kepler space telescope and is expected to find dozens of Earth - like planets orbiting distant stars .
While it seems likely that some may host complex life forms , it could take generations to reach them as even the nearest stars are very far away .
Given the time and conditions , a degree in rocket science is n’t necessary to estimate that by the time astronauts reach their destination , any auditions for Star Trek : Another Sequel will be off limits .
It would seem inevitable that a discussion of this nature at the Cheltenham Science Festival would spark a debate about what aliens from other worlds might look like .
Once again , according to Dr. Dartnell : “ Certain features of the human body , such as camera - like eyes , head , and legs would evolve time and time again on different worlds , and so many features of alien animals are likely to be instantly recognizable .
However , other features of life , such as the number of limbs animals develop , or the shape and color of trees , would be much more variable between worlds . ”
And so fellow earthlings , time will tell about what our intrepid space explorers will find .
How they will be received is another story .
Has anyone ever considered making another movie about ET , but one that tells the tale of his reaction to bloated , bald earthling invading his time and space ?
Steven Spielberg , are you listening ?
What do YOU think about this ?
Space travel is here to stay as earth - bound pioneers envision new frontiers to explore and new thresholds to bravely cross .
The intrepid souls who dare to venture into the unknown will do so at a price as according to news sources , making long space journeys are destined to leave astronauts short , fat and very bald .
In the words of astro- biologist , Dr. Lewis Dartnell : Launched earlier this year , the Kepler space telescope and is expected to find dozens of Earth - like planets orbiting distant stars .

A Florida man who was convicted of murder in part because of the work of an allegedly infallible scent - tracking dog , was freed from jail eight months ago because DNA testing confirmed that the dog and the dog ’s owner were a fraud .
Unfortunately for Bill Dillon he had to spend 26 years in prison before the error in his case was rectified .
Bill Dillon , was 22 when he was sentenced to life in prison in 1981 , for killing a man in Canova Beach on the eastern coast of the state .
During the trial , Dillon was adamant that he had not committed the crime .
But a man named John Preston testified in court that he and his scent - tracking German - Shepherd connected Dillon to the killer ’s bloody t- shirt .
Preston said his dog , “ Harrass 2 , ” even tracked Dillon ’s scent repeatedly in later tests .
Dillon expected to remain in prison for the rest of his life – all because of “ Harrass 2 , ” and his handler , Preston , who billed himself around the country as a so - called scent - tracking expert .
But nearly three decades later , in 2007 , DNA testing proved that Dillon ’s DNA did not match the DNA on the killer ’s shirt .
The dog was wrong .
Just eight months ago , after 26 years behind bars , Bill Dillon walked out of prison a free man .
“ Supposedly the dog got my scent three times , ” Dillon told CNN , “ and I never saw freedom again . ”
Dillon also said he remembers the dog ’s “ huge ” head from the trial and that he looked like a “ bear . ”
In 1981 , DNA testing was n’t used in criminal investigations so authorities relied simply on the presumed legendary nose of Preston ’s German Shepherd .
Preston testified that his dog had tracked Dillon ’s scent to a piece of paper he had touched , and had even tracked Dillon to a room he was in at the courthouse .
Preston and his dog had a track - record – he had convinced juries more than a hundred times of his dog ’s miraculous talents .
In Dillon ’s case , Preston even told the court his dog had the ability to track a scent under water ; to actually smell below the water .
CNN consulted tracking dog experts in Florida about this .
They told us “ no way , that ’s not possible . ”
In 1984 , before Preston was exposed as a fraud , he told ABC News that he believed he was never wrong .
Tim McGuire , a dog- tracking expert with Florida ’s Volusia County Sheriff ’s Department , said it was implausible that a dog could have picked up Dillon ’s scent back in 1981 eight days after the murder , and just after a massive hurricane had blown through the area .
McGuire viewed videotapes of Preston ’s dog , Harrass 2 , at work .
In the tapes , there are multiple times when the dog urinates on evidence .
“ The dog should work methodically . ”
But McGuire said he did not consider what Harrass 2 was doing , “ work . ”
Preston was exposed by a Florida judge in 1984 , who became suspicious of Preston and set up his own test for Harrass 2 .
The dog failed terribly .
Documents obtained by CNN show he could not even follow a scent for one - hundred feet .
The judge determined the dog could only track successfully when his handler had advance knowledge of the case .
Dillon thinks Preston and his scent - tracking dog were part of a larger conspiracy .
“ Preston could lead the dog to the suspect or the evidence , ” alleges Dillon , but “ any cases that were weak , not good enough to go to the jury , they [ the prosecution ] fed Preston information , paid him good money to come and lie . ”
Florida ’s Attorney General told CNN it is not aware of any evidence of a conspiracy involving John Preston and his dog .
Preston and his four - legged so - called expert were discredited in 1987 .
But the state of Florida never reviewed cases on which he ’d testified .
And nobody ever told Bill Dillon – who sat in prison another 20 years before he ever knew a thing about it .
It was n’t until 2006 that he heard Preston was a fake .
Florida ’s Innocence Project believes dozens of inmates around the country may have been wrongly convicted as a result of John Preston and his dog .
It is calling for an investigation of those cases .
Meanwhile , Preston , the dog ’s handler , died last year .
He was never charged with perjury or convicted of a crime .
Most rose gardens rarely capture the true potential that these plants have in the overall landscape plan .
The true potential of roses does n’t just lie within the plants themselves .
It lies within the surroundings , elements , and simplicity as well .
Balance created through mass planting , single colors , and garden shapes is most common .
Pay close attention to the pictures in this article and you ’ll see about what I mean .
Traveling around , you can find many beautiful rose gardens but we pick up our favs :
The Rose Hills Pageant of Roses Garden contains one of the most extensive collections of roses in southern California .
It is open every day of the year , and there is no charge for admission .
“ The City of Roses ” , Portland , Oregon – There are over 7,000 rose plants of approximately 550 varieties .
The roses bloom from April through October with the peak coming in June , depending on the weather .
New rose cultivars are continually sent to the garden from many parts of the world and are tested for color , fragrance , disease resistance and other attributes .
It is the oldest continuously operating public rose test garden in the United States and exemplifies Portland ’s nickname of the City of Roses .
A great example how to garden with roses ; a Path with Rose Arches .
The ‘ Blaze ’ Rose in Foreground , an ‘ Zephirine Drouhin ’ in the back The Oakland Rose Garden – Back in the 1930s , under President Franklin Roosevelt ’s New Deal , the WPA , the Works Progress Administration , built numerous landscaping projects throughout the Bay Area .
Notable were the Aquatic Park in San Francisco , The Mountain Theatre on Mount Tamalpais , the Berkeley Rose Garden and John Hinckle Park in Berkeley , and the Woodminster Theatre in Joaquin Miller Park in Oakland .

The Eastern Dragon , along with the European Dragon , are the two most familiar interpretations of dragons .
Unlike European dragons , which have bat - type wings , the Eastern Dragon can take on human form and are usually seen as benevolent , whereas European dragons are usually malevolent though there are exceptions .
In many Asian cultures dragons were revered as representative of the primal forces of nature , religion and the universe .
We have selected 30 Eastern Dragon illustrations , some are firece , some are cute , some are delicate .
They all show us a feeling of holiness in some way .
We hope you can get a little inspiration from the following artworks like we do .
Just enjoy it !

Remember late last year , when AMD poured out the liquid nitrogen to boost its new Phenom II X4 to a ridiculous 5GHZ ?
The company 's factory overclockers apparently had a lot of leftover LN2 , so they invited a crew of others to come over and splash some around on a set of new Phenom II X4 955 Black processors .
After burning through a ridiculous 80 gallons of the stuff they rolled out the even colder liquid helium , which led to a maximum benchmark of 6.89GHz -- more than twice the quad - core processor 's 3.2GHz rated speed .
In these tough economic times it 's good to see that one company at least is still willing to take things to great excesses at the expense of Earth 's natural resources .
If your over 40 , you 'll see dis kitty as John Lennon .

Fanatical followers will recognise most of the topics I discussed from earlier slide shows , but the last one , about the changes to the market share of IE6 , 7 , and 8 , is new .
Basically , IE6 will continue to exist when IE7 has all but disappeared , and , contrary to what you might expect , this situation will create exciting opportunities for Microsoft ’s competitors .
Besides , last week the news came that Microsoft is going to voluntarily de-bundle IE from all Windows 7 machines that will be sold in Europe , and I continue to have my doubts about that affair .
So it ’s time for a special State of the Browsers IE edition .
Market share
As we all know IE8 is out , and whatever your opinion , no one will doubt that it ’s a better browser than IE7 , and that a quick growth of the IE8 market share will serve web developers well .
Still , the real problem for web developers is IE6 .
That ’s the browser we absolutely have to get rid of .
IE8 is picking up quite a bit of market share right now ; but as far as I can see that share mostly comes from IE7 , and not from IE6 .
The following graph shows where I think the market shares of the various IEs are heading :
Although IE8 will become the largest Microsoft browser , I expect IE6 to retain about 20 to 25 % of the market even by the end of 2010 ( OK , maybe 15 % , but still considerable ) , while IE7 will drop below IE6 sometime ( early ? ) next year .
Now why do I expect IE6 to stick around while IE7 goes down ?
The answer is simple : Intranets .
Intranets
In the era of IE6 dominance ( 2000 - 2006 ) , countless companies created countless Intranet application for time registration , sales support , contact information , you name it .
All these applications are absolutely vital for the daily datastream in these companies .
Some companies deliberately opted for Microsoft technology and a Microsoft - only Intranet , while others were lazy and did n’t bother to make these apps compatible with other browsers , even though they did not particularly use Microsoft products .
The net result is that there are countless vital apps around the world that only work with IE6 .
Not with another browser — not even IE7 .
Therefore the companies did not upgrade their browser .
( Incidentally , this was the most important reason for Microsoft to introduce the versioning switch — the IE team wanted to prevent a repeat performance of this problem . )
Sure , some companies will revise these apps to work with other browsers , but many wo n’t , partly because it costs too much money in this time of recession , partly because it ’s so hard to find good front - end engineers ( which good front - ender wants to work on Intranet applications for several years ? ) , and partly because the old apps still work , do n’t they ?
So many old apps wo n’t change , and many office workers will continue to be condemned to IE6 .
Office vs. home
At work , that is .
It ’s quite likely that on their private computer at home they run another browser — IE7 or 8 , Firefox , or maybe one of the smaller ones .
What generally gets too little attention is the difference between browser stats during office hours and browser stats outside office hours .
More than one web developer told me in the past year that there is quite a bit of difference between the two .
Basically , most of the IE6 market share comes from office - hour surfing , while it drops significantly in the after - hours period .
This is something to keep an eye on when a client comes with his site stats .
If you can , split out the office hours and after - hours stats , and take a look at the pattern that emerges .
I would n’t be surprised if business - to - business clients will continue to demand IE6 compatibility , while business - to - consumer clients will start to drop this demand — especially when we put a realistic price tag on IE6 .
It all depends on when users visit their site .
Update : reader S. Anand found exactly the predicted result when he checked his logfiles
The price tag
I think that we web developers will start to get fed up with IE6 to such a degree that we are actually going to charge more money when this browser comes into play .
“ Want a site that works perfectly in IE6 ?
Fine , but it ’ll cost you about 20 to 30 % extra . ”
In fact , I hope web developers will start to charge this extra amount reasonably soon .
Some clients wo n’t be willing to pay , which will save you a lot of heartache ( and hair care products ) , some clients will actually pay you for your extra-special IE6 trouble , and yes , you might lose some business as a result .
Therefore this is a decision everybody should take on their own .
Despite understandable hesitation , in the long run charging extra money for IE6 compatibility is inevitable .
The result will be that less and less sites will work perfectly in IE6 .
Two corporate browsers
The victims will be the office workers during office hours .
They ’ll find that they are less and less able to view perfect sites on the Internet — even though their Intranet applications will still work fine .
The obvious solution to this problem will be to install another browser for real surfing on the corporate network .
Whichever browser the company will eventually select , one thing is certain : it will not be IE .
After all , it ’s officially impossible to install several IE versions next to each other , and I doubt whether cautious and conservative corporate sysadmins will go with one of the unofficial ways .
In fact , a source within a large company told me they are seriously considering installing Opera as the real browser on their internal network , and use IE6 only for accessing their internal apps .
I have no idea whether that will actually happen in this particular company , but it shows that the basic scenario is viable .
Thus IE6 will more and more become an internal system browser , while office workers use a non-IE browser to surf the real Internet .
This process will work to the detriment of IE ’s overall market share relative to the other browsers .
Companies will be forced to choose one non-IE browser .
Which one ?
Probably the one with the best marketing machine .
This opens up perspectives for the other browser vendors — unless they ’re locked up in battles that are purported to serve and protect web developers and end users , but will certainly harm the latter , while the former will not benefit much .
Opera vs. Microsoft , round 3
Microsoft has voluntarily decided to unbundle IE from all Windows 7 computers that will be sold in Europe .
It leaves the choice and installation of the browser to the hardware vendors or the consumers .
This is supposed to be a great victory for web standards .
Hurray , hurray .
Frankly , I ’m getting downright frightened of the whole affair .
I wish the European Commission , Opera , and their allies would just stop it .
It ’s opening the path for an endless series of partisan complaints .
Sure , it was to Microsoft ’s advantage that IE was automatically installed on any Windows computer .
Sure , it has inflated IE ’s market share to 90 % , because the other browser vendors did n’t have comparable distribution channels .
Still , I wonder if anybody would have complained if IE had been 100 % standards compliant .
It ’s the combination of distribution advantage with the eternal IE6 problems that made people get sick of Microsoft .
Besides , I have my doubts about the fairness of the process .
I have not yet heard a similar complaint against Apple for tying Safari to its operating system .
Or against the KDE guys for tying Konqueror to theirs , for that matter .
Canned worms , anyone ?
In any case , Microsoft is not awaiting the European Commission ’s formal ruling and has chosen the Zero option .
A new Windows computer will contain zero browsers — unless the hardware vendor installs a browser of its choice .
There are several things wrong with this solution :
Suppose a consumer buys a new computer and it does n’t have any browser installed on it .
How is he going to get one ?
Probable answer : some kind of temporary download program that pops up the very first time he uses his computer and gives him the choice of no less than five browsers .
Problem is , the consumer does n’t want this choice because he has no idea what ’s going on .
Besides , if this solution is implemented we can expect a stream of complaints from the truly tiny browsers nobody has ever heard of .
In all fairness , we should include them , too .
So the user will get the choice of eight to ten ( twelve ? fourteen ? ) browsers — a choice he does n’t want and has no idea what to do with .
Or will somebody have to decide which browsers to allow in this program ?
Who ?
How long will it take before this person or institution is accused of unfairness because he forgot one browser ?
Now suppose the hardware vendor installs one browser on the computer .
Even worse , suppose this browser is actually IE .
Are we going to get a crusade against hardware vendors , too , for daring to install the wrong browser ?
Suppose the world caves in to the mighty pressure of teh Interwebz and forsakes IE forever .
Now hardware vendors will install another browser .
Let ’s say they mostly opt for Firefox — a reasonable choice in today ’s market .
Will we get a re-run of the entire thing , but now aimed against those evil hardware vendors who ’re giving Firefox an unfair advantage ?
If so , when will it stop ?
If not , where ’s the fairness in the process ?
We ’re opening up a can of worms that should remain firmly closed .
Precedent
Finally , with this ruling we ’re setting a precedent that I feel should not be set .
Opera Mobile used as default browser for all HTC phones ?
Unfair advantage !
Google WebKit default for Android ?
Unfair advantage !
And let ’s not talk about the iPhone and Apple ’s manifestly hideous unfair advantage there .
If we take this ruling to it utmost conclusion a mobile phone vendor may not install a default browser on its system , but will have to allow consumers free choice , too .
So the innocent end user who just wants to surf with his brand new mobile phone will first have to pick one of approximately two dozen browsers .
Where will it stop ?
I feel we should allow Microsoft to continue to bundle IE with Windows .
Not because it ’s good and proper what Microsoft has been doing , but because the alternatives are far worse .
As I showed in the first part of this article , Microsoft ’s competitors are granted a unique chance to conquer the office market .
I feel they should spend their energy on that part of the market instead of setting potentially dangerous precedents that will most likely harm the end - users more than anyone else .
Comments are closed .
The other day , I talked to a C++ developer , who is relatively new in the language , about the C++ training they just had at his company .
The training topics were already somewhat advanced and contained e.g. STL containers and their peculiarities , STL algorithms and some boost stuff like binders and smart pointers .
That got me thinking about how much of STL and boost does a C++ developer just has to know in order to survive their C++ projects .
There is also another angle to this .
There are certain corners of the C++ language , e.g. template metaprogramming , which are just hard to get , even for more experienced developers .
And because of that , in my opinion , they have no place in a standard industry C++ project .
But where do you draw the line ?
With template meta - programming it is obvious that it probably will never be in every day usage by Joe Developer .
But what about e.g. boost ’s multi-index container or their functional programming stuff ?
One could say that it depends on the skills of team whether more advanced stuff can be used or not .
But suppose your team consist largely of C++ beginners and does not have much experience in the language , would you want to pass on using Boost .
Spirit when you had to do some serious parsing ?
Or would you want to use error codes instead of decent exceptions , because they add a lot more potentially “ invisible ” code paths ?
Probably not , but those are certainly no easy decisions .
One of the problems with STL and boost for a C++ beginner can be illustrated with the following easy problem :
How do you convert an int into a std :: string and back ?
Having already internalized the stream classes the beginner might come up with something like this :
int i = 5 ; std::ostringstream out ; out << i ; std:: string i_string = out.str( ) ; int j=0 ; std::istringstream in( i_string ) ; in >> j ; assert ( i == j ) ;
But if he just had learned a little boost he would know that , in fact , it is as easy as this :
int i=5 ; std::string i_string = boost::lexical_cast<std::string >( i ) ; int j = boost ::lexical_cast<int >( i_string ) ;
So you just have to know some basic boost stuff in order to write fairly decent C++ code .
Besides boost : : lexical_cast , which is part of the Boost Conversion Library , here is my personal list of mandatory boost knowledge :
Boost .
Assign :
Why still bother with std :: map::push_back and the likes , if there is a much easier and concise syntax to initialize containers ?
Boost .
Bind ( If you use functional programming ) :
No one should be forced to wade through the mud of STL binders any longer .
Boost : : bind is just so much easier .
Boost .
Foreach : Every for - loop becomes a code - smell after your first use of BOOST_FOREACH .
Boost .
Member Function : see Boost .
Bind
Boost .
Smart Pointers :
No comment is needed on that one .
As you can see , these are only the most basic libraries .
Other extremely useful things for day - to - day programming are e.g. Boost .
FileSystem , Boost .
DateTime , Boost .
Exceptions , Boost .
Format , Boost .
Unordered and Boost . Utilities .
Of course , you do n’t have to memorize every part of the boost libraries , but boost.org should in any case be the first address to look for a solution to your daily C++ challenges .
The French Senate has approved an updated version of the " three strikes " online copyright infringement bill aimed at taking repeat offenders offline .
The approval comes exactly one month after the country 's Constitutional Council ripped apart the previous version of the Cr�ation et Internet law .
The nouveau version of the bill attempts to get around the constitutional limitations by moving the final decision to cut off users '
Internet accounts to the courts .
Originally , Cr�ation et Internet set up a High Authority in France that would oversee a graduated response program designed to curb online piracy .
Rightsholders would investigate , submit complaints to the High Authority ( called HADOPI , after its French acronym ) , and the Authority would take action .
Warnings would be passed to ISPs , who would forward them to customers ; after two such warnings , the subscriber could be disconnected and placed on a nationwide " no Internet " blacklist .
The first version of the bill was foiled by a handful of Socialists who voted it down , but the law managed to pass on its second attempt in May of this year .
The law still had to be scrutinized by the Constitutional Council , however , and this was where it ran into trouble .
The graduated response program was nonjudicial , setting up a separate " administrative " authority , but it performed an essentially judicial function .
The sanction proceedings had a presupposition of guilt — the burden of proof was on the Internet user to show that he or she had not been pirating .
The Council focused primarily on this aspect of the law , emphasizing that everyone is presumed innocent until proven guilty under the Declaration of 1789 , and that this principle applies " to any sanction in the nature of punishment , even if the legislature has left the decision to an authority that is nonjudicial in nature . "
The Council 's censure indicated that disconnections must be treated like court cases and not just administrative proceedings .
As a result , the law was shot down .
Bring in the judges
Not content to let the idea die , President Nicolas Sarkozy 's administration reworked the law in hopes of making it amenable to the Council — instead of HADOPI deciding on its own to cut off users on the third strike , it will now report offenders to the courts .
A judge can then choose to ban the user from the Internet , fine him or her � 300,000 ( according to the AFP ) , or hand over a two - year prison sentence .
Those who are merely providing an Internet connection to dirty pirates can be fined � 1,500 and / or receive a month - long temp ban from the online world .
( A group of French hackers has already begun to work on software that cracks the passwords on locked WiFi networks so that there 's an element of plausible deniability when law enforcement tries to go after home network owners . )
The Senate approved this version of the bill with a vote of 189 - 142 this week , sending it to the National Assembly for final passage .
While certainly an improvement , even the new version of the bill cannot escape criticism from open Internet groups , who still believe that the system makes it too easy for non-judicial entities to enforce punishments .
In a post to its website , La Quadrature du Net wrote that those who approved the bill are trying to reduce the courts to nothing more than a rubber stamp and that the bill mocks the values of the constitution .
The group called on other legislators to denounce the bill when it comes to a vote later this month .

DISMAL scientists are finding more reasons than ever to worry about the prospects for America 's economy — even though the country 's GDP somehow still manages to grow at a decent lick .
Oil prices are high , of course ; partly as a result , inflation is rising .
Consumer debt is at record levels .
America is borrowing from abroad on a gargantuan scale to finance its current - account gap .
And the housing bubble may be bursting .
For a growing number of economists and policymakers , however , the greatest fear of all — not least because its long - term consequences may be so deep — is that America is losing its global lead in technology .
In the battle to invent and innovate , China and India , in particular , with their gazillion - strong cohorts of engineering and science graduates , will soon overwhelm the dullards and liberal arts students churned out by America 's education system .
Nor is this a uniquely American worry .
You hear similar worries in Europe too , although there the fear is less of losing the lead than of falling even further behind .
Such ideas , expressed in alarming books such as “ Three Billion New Capitalists : The Great Shift of Wealth and Power to the East ” , by Clyde Prestowitz , once a trade negotiator in the Reagan administration , are being cited increasingly by supporters of a wide range of potential remedies .
These include getting more Americans to study science and engineering , bigger tax breaks for research and development , and trade protection to prevent the innovative hordes from China and India from storming America 's gates .
Innovative thinking
In a marvellously contrarian new paper * , Amar Bhidé , of Columbia University 's business school , argues that these supposed remedies , and the worries that lie behind them , are based on a misconception of how innovation works and of how it contributes to economic growth .
Mr Bhidé finds plenty of nice things to say about many of the things that most trouble critics of the American economy : consumption as opposed to thrift ; a plentiful supply of consumer credit ; Wal - Mart ; even the marketing arms of drug companies .
He thinks that good managers may be at least as valuable as science and engineering graduates ( though given where he works , perhaps he is talking his own book ) .
But he has nothing nice to say about the prophets of technological doom .
Mr Bhidé says that the doomsayers are guilty of the “ techno - fetishism and techno - nationalism ” described in 1995 by two economists , Sylvia Ostry and Richard Nelson .
This consists , first , of paying too much attention to the upstream development of new inventions and technologies by scientists and engineers , and too little to the downstream process of turning these inventions into products that tempt people to part with their money , and , second , of the belief that national leadership in upstream activities is the same thing as leadership in generating economic value from innovation .
But nowadays innovation — a complex , gradual process , often involving many firms making incremental advances over many years — is not much constrained by national borders , argues Mr Bhidé .
Indeed , the sort of upstream innovation ( the big ideas of those scientists and engineers ) most celebrated by those who fear its movement to China and India is the hardest to keep locked up in the domestic market .
The least internationally mobile innovation , on the other hand , is the downstream sort , where big ideas are made suitable for a local market .
Mr Bhidé argues that this downstream innovation , which is far more complex and customised than the original upstream invention , is the most valuable kind and what America is best at .
Moreover , perhaps the most important fact overlooked by the techno - nationalists , notes Mr Bhidé , is that most of the value of innovations accrues to their users not their creators — and stays in the country where the innovation is consumed .
So if China and India do more invention , so much the better for American consumers .
The most important part of innovation may be the willingness of consumers , whether individuals or firms , to try new products and services , says Mr Bhidé .
In his view , it is America 's venturesome consumers that drive the country 's leadership in innovation .
Particularly important has been the venturesome consumption of new innovations by American firms .
Although America has a lowish overall investment rate compared with other rich countries , it has a very high rate of adoption of information technology ( IT ) .
Contrast that with Japan ( the original technology bogeyman from the East ) where , despite an abundance of inventive scientists and engineers , many firms remain primitive in their use of IT .
One reason why American firms are able to be so venturesome is that they have the managers capable of adapting their organisations to embrace innovation , says Mr Bhidé .
Pressure to be venturesome may have come from America 's highly competitive markets .
And America 's downstream firms are arguably the world 's leaders in finding ways to encourage consumers to try new things , not least through their enormous marketing arms and by ensuring that there is a lavish supply of credit .
No doubt , even venturesome consumers can overdo their enthusiasm for innovation , just as venturesome investors overdid it during the dotcom bubble .
Yet , if Mr Bhidé is right — and a lot more hard data would do wonders for his case — then America 's policymakers should worry more about how to keep consumers consuming than about the number of science and engineering graduates , at home or in the East .
