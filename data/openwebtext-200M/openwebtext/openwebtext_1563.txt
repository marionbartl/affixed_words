New rules are now in place for airlines to make sure people like Faisal Shahzad -- the suspect in the failed Times Square bombing saturday who was on a no - fly list -- are n't allowed to board airplanes .
Shahzad had been placed on the no-fly list Monday around 12:30 p.m .
An electronic notification was sent to airlines a few minutes later .
Nevertheless , seven hours later , shortly before 7:30 p.m. , Shahzad was purchased a ticket to fly to Pakistan , via Dubai , aboard Emirates Air -- paying with cash -- and still no flags were raised .
The flight was scheduled to take off around 11 p.m. and Shahzad 's name still had n't been checked when he boarded the plane .
It was n't until the final passenger list was sent to the U.S. Customs and Borders Agency , just minutes before takeoff , that Shahzad was stopped and arrested .
Today , White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs announced new rules for the no-fly list -- making mandatory updates faster -- which took effect immediately .
He pointed out that Emirates Air did nothing wrong by not checking the passengers ' names against the no-fly list .
He said " the airline did n't have to check necessarily at that point .
The new rules require that that happen at a two - hour interval . "
That means airlines must now check for any notifications about the no-fly list , every two hours .
New York 's Senator Charles Schumer pointed out " that requirement is long overdue . "
He is asking the Obama Administration to also flag airline passengers who pay cash , something that is n't automatically done just because a traveler uses greenbacks .
" People who pay cash -- not always -- but may be paying to avoid detection , " said Schumer .
" That name should be monitored on the no-fly list . "
And several travelers we spoke with at JFK Airport supported Schumer 's idea .
Jason Pressburg , of Yorktown , New York , was flying to Israel and said " I pay with a credit card for things .
And it just feels spooky when someone does n't . "
Patrick Griffiths , an attorney who lives in the Rosedale section of Queens , believes that if the government " deems it necessary at this point to ( check cash - paying travelers against the no- fly list ) , then we must do it . "
Another concern raised by Sen. Schumer is the role of the airlines in managing passenger security .
Schumer said security measures " should all be done as much by the government as possible , not by the airlines . "
He said it would n't cost much to make sure that current Transportation Security Administration agents check flagged passengers against the nation 's no -fly list .
Lieutenant Commander Tommy Woodroffe was the BBC radio commentator at the 1938 FA Cup Final .
As time ticked down , Woodroffe famously said : " If there 's a goal now , I 'll eat my hat . "
It just so happened that a goal came and he did eat his hat .
If you thought that was a strange tale then read on to find out 10 more odd football stories .
1 . Who ate all the pies ?
Have you ever wondered what the answer to that ' terrace chant ' is ?
Well , football fans of the 1890's and early 1900's would have been united in their answer of William ' Fatty ' Foulke .
The infamous goalkeeper played for Chelsea , Bradford City and England and stood at over six foot tall and weighed a mighty 25 stone .
Foulke was larger than life .
He had the ability to punch a ball from his own area to over the half way line ( further than many can kick it ! ) , he was also well - known for picking opposition players up off the ground .
In one match , while playing for Bradford City against Accrington Stanley , there was concern that Foulke 's jersey clashed with the colour of his opponents - when no replacement could be found a bed - sheet was found from a local house and Foulke wrapped himself in and got on with the match .
During a match while he played for Chelsea , Foulke decided to swing from the crossbar .
His mighty weight brought the crossbar crashing down , injuring the keeper - it took six men to carry him off the field .
Another incident while at Chelsea happened off the field .
When Foulke arrived first to the breakfast table before an important match he decided to wait it out for the rest of his team - mates .
When they did n't arrive quickly , Foulkes ate everything on the table himself .
Is it any wonder he was nicknamed ' Fatty ' !
2. I name you ...
Some fans support their team with great gusto , others take it a step too far .
One such man , who showed dedication beyond the normal fan , was a Mr O'Sullivan who was a staunch Liverpool supporter .
When Liverpool won the FA Cup in 1965 , Mr O'Sullivan decided to christen his newly born daughter with the names of all the Liverpool players .
The poor girl was christened : Paula , St John , Lawrence , Lawler , Byrne , Strong , Yates , Stevenson , Callaghan , Hunt , Milne , Smith , Thompson , Shankley , Bennett , Paisley , O'Sullivan .
Rumors that she grew up to be a Everton fan are as yet unconfirmed !
3 . Who says Christmas should be spent at home ?
In days gone by , it was not unknown for football matches to be played on Christmas day .
The players in those days were probably not too happy about having to ' work ' on such a holiday - all apart from Tommy Lawton and Len Shackleton !
On Christmas day , 1940 , both Lawton and Shackleton managed to cram in two games of football before the turkey was stuffed .
Shackleton appeared for Bradford Park Avenue in the morning , before playing for Bradford City in the afternoon .
Lawton played for Everton against Liverpool in the morning , before turning out for Tranmere in the afternoon .
Perhaps their wives cooking was n't up to much .
4 . Stan the man !
They say that one man does not maketh a team .
Try telling that to the money - makers of Stoke .
Stanley Matthews had played for Blackpool for 15 years before re-signing to previous club Stoke for a fee of £ 2,800 ( a lot of money back then ! ) .
Stoke made that money back , and some , from Matthew 's first game back whn a total of 35,975 fans passed through the turnstiles to see the return of their hero .
In the previous home game , Stoke had a crowd of only 8,000 .
Just from having Matthews in the team , an extra 27 , 565 fans paid money .
5 . Blame the ref
What defines a dirty game ?
Number of players booked may be a good indication .
Things may have got a bit out of hand though in November 1969 when Tongham Youth Club lined up to play Hawley .
All 22 players were booked by the referee , but the madness did n't stop there .
One of the linesmen was also shown the yellow card !
6. Indoor football - waterlogged pitch
The Guiness sixes ( an indoor football tournament ) was once held at the Dundonald Ice Bowl , Belfast .
Do n't worry , the football players were n't expected to wear ice - skates to play in , instead , a thick carpet was laid over the ice .
All of that was fine until some ' bright - spark ' decided to switch off the compressor that was keeping the ice solid .
The organisers were left with a decision to make , either switch on the compressor and cancel the tournament for a frozen pitch or get the mops out .
They managed to get most of the water off the pitch but not all .
Viewers of BBC Northern Ireland were treated to the sight of football players sliding through the odd puddle of water and at an indoor game too !
7 . You 're booked - No , you 're booked
What is the strangest incident that a yellow card has been flashed for ?
Probably the one in this video ;
The referee had obviously dropped his yellow card earlier on in the game and it was finally found by Paul Gascoigne .
Being the ' cheeky - chappy ' that he is , Gascoigne could n't resist ' booking ' the ref before handing it back .
The referee did not have a sense of humour and promptly booked the player !
8 . Put a cork in it
Or indeed take the cork out and carry it around with you everywhere .
George Young , famed ex-Rangers and Scotland defender , helped break the Ibrox club 's Scottish Cup jinx when he led the team to victory in 1948 against Greenock Morton .
Young was first to ' pop ' open the Champagne and decided to keep the cork , he carried it around with him everywhere he went after that as a lucky charm .
Because of this , Young was given the nickname ' Corky ' .
9. Oxford or Cambridge ?
There are not too many people who can claim honours from both Oxford and Cambridge but one such person was Ron Atkinson .
Not from the University 's though - Atkinson , as a player , helped Oxford climb from the fourth division to the second division ; as a manager , Atkinson helped Cambridge win the third division .
10 . I see dead people
In years gone by , FA Cup ties were played over two legs .
Such was the case in season 1945 - 46 when Barnsley had to play Newcastle at home after losing 4 - 2 away from home .
The match ws scheduled as a mid-week fixture , which usually meant low crowds .
Because it was such a big match for Barnsley , local employers anticipated a lot of people might ' call in sick ' .
With that in mind , local collieries posted notices informing employees : " In order that the management may have knowledge of numbers to be absent on Wednesday afternoon , will thoe whose relatives are to be buried on the day please apply by Tuesday for permission to attend . "
It was a clever attempt to try and get round the problem - too clever by far , as it appeared that there was going to be somewhere in the region of 27,000 funerals that day !
The game itself was certainly not a ' funeral ' as Barnsley overturned the deficit with a 3 - 0 victory - happiest ' funeral ' any of those people ever attended .
This has to be the strangest combination gadget ever and yet I could see it becoming very handy .
Instead of waking up to an obnoxious beep , you could wake up to that beep noise and quickly recover with a nice hot cup of tea .
Of course maybe you should keep away from the chamomile , it ’s probably best not to do anything that might help you fall back to sleep .
If you like instant coffee instead of tea , it can do that as well .
Should you be a tea fan though it ’ll require 2 of your favorite tea bags and your own cup and saucer set .
You just put either your mix or tea bags into the teapot the night before and fill up the Teasmade with cold water .
A few minutes before the alarm it ’ll boil the water and then the alarm will go off after the water is finished .
You can purchase it for £ 59.99 or about $ 88 through MenKind .

For 35 years , Josip Broz Tito held Yugoslavia together despite its mix of nationalities , languages and religions .
After his death in 1980 , simmering ethnic tensions resurfaced , eventually leading to the wars in the Balkan states .
Former BBC correspondent Martin Bell returned to the region to examine Tito 's legacy .
Tito is blamed by some for the wars that tore the region apart
His power once held Yugoslavia together under the banner of brotherhood and unity .
But now his memory divides it - or the many republics into which it has disintegrated .
Thirty years after the death of Josip Broz Tito , there are still some Serbs , Croats , Bosnians and others who describe themselves , rather wistfully , as " Yugo - nostalgics " .
The country wielded an influence beyond its size .
It successfully played off one superpower against the other , and was one of the leaders of the non-aligned movement .
Mixed feelings
When the man who was Yugoslavia died in May 1980 , the list of mourners at his funeral read like a roll call of world leaders .
And yet there are others who blame him for the wars that tore the region apart some 11 years after his death .
Having reported those wars myself , I have tried to trace their origins while retracing my steps through Bosnia , Serbia and Croatia , talking to Tito 's comrades in arms and to some of the politicians - new and old - including Stjepan Mesic , who stepped down in February as President of Croatia .
I also spoke to Tito 's youngest grandson Andre who , like Mr Mesic , is proud to be a part of the new Croatia .
' Seeds of nationalism '
But one of the primary witnesses was Raif Dizdaravic , now in his 80s , whom I met in the cavernous coffee shop of the old Hotel Europa in Sarajevo .
The war in Bosnia cost 97,000 lives
Once an officer in Tito 's Partisans he was Yugoslavia 's foreign minister , speaker of its parliament , and then one of the rotating presidents after the dictator 's death .
He was there at the beginning and there at the end .
Mr Dizdaravic believes that the seeds of nationalism were sown in a new constitution in 1974 , which loosened the federal structure without introducing necessary economic reforms .
Politicians in the richer republics harvested votes by wondering aloud why they should subsidise the poorer ones .
He told me : " When we actually decided to move towards decentralisation , we were not giving time to the economy .
Instead we were giving time to the republics . "
' Politics of identity '
The old flags and anthems were banned under Tito , but out of sight did not mean out of mind .
The dream of One Yugoslavia fell apart under the pressure of this resurgent nationalism .
Martin Bell reported on the Balkan conflicts for several years I remember some of the fiercest battles of the war in Croatia were fought on the so - called Highway of Brotherhood and Unity .
In the war in Bosnia , they were fought on the Bridge of Brotherhood and Unity in Sarajevo .
In most countries of the former Yugoslavia , little has been done to safeguard Tito 's legend and in Serbia many of the statues and the Marshal Tito streets have disappeared .
One of the effects of the Bosnia war especially - which cost 97,000 lives over three years - has been the separation of its peoples .
Muslims , Croats and Serbs - who used to live alongside each other - mostly do so no longer .
This is the politics of identity .
Sarajevo is now identifiably a Muslim city in a sense that it was not when the war began .
More mosques are in it now , say the Serbs , than in Tehran .
The Bosnian Serbs in their mini state , with its capital in Banja Luka , are determined to save the separate status conferred on them by the Dayton agreement in late 1995 .
It was Dayton that brought an end to the war but produced a constitution that was a recipe for deadlock .
' National space '
The Bosnian government , under the leadership of Haris Silajdzic , is pressing for something closer to a unitary state .
Both Serbs and Croats feel threatened .
Raif Dizdaravic blames lack of economic reform for nationalist splits
One of the outcomes is that there is hardly a functioning government at all .
Elections are coming and that means playing the nationalist card yet again .
Some Bosnian Serbs are threatening a referendum on independence , a breakaway state on the model of Kosovo .
But no - one would recognise it .
And Bosnia without its Serbs would not be Bosnia .
Stjepan Mesic , the Croatian ex-President , has even suggested armed intervention to break the Serbian mini-state ( the Republika Serbska ) into two .
Thirty years after Tito 's death , there is not so much to celebrate in his legacy , except that the wars are over .
Bosnia , Serbia and Croatia are not mutually hostile states , although their entangled histories weigh heavily upon them .
They all aspire to membership of the European Union , which might over time blunt the edge of nationalism and return to them that sense of a " national space " which they have not had since the death of Tito and the fall of Yugoslavia .
Martin Bell 's two - part series The Rise And Fall Of Yugoslavia - The Story Of Tito will be broadcast on Monday 26 April and Monday 3 May at 2000 BST on BBC Radio 4 and will be available for seven days after that on the BBC iPlayer .

Garrett Heaton can't speak highly enough of his bank .
" USAA is a FANTASTIC bank , and their services and customer service are top - notch , " he says -- especially its Deposit@Home feature , which lets users scan checks for immediate deposit into their account .
There 's just one problem : Heaton , a N.Y. - based member of the military , is a Linux user -- and USAA 's Deposit@Home feature is designed for use only on Windows and Macintosh computers .
Aiming to get the system opened up to users of other operating systems , Heaton began an email conversation with the bank last July that still continues today .
He recently gave LinuxInsider the chain of correspondence as an illustration of the difficulties Linux users sometimes have to endure .
If nothing else , it 's a lesson in perseverance .
Masquerading as a Mac
" I am writing to inform you that through a few steps ( by the user ) , Linux and other Unix users are able to spoof having a Macintosh computer and still able to use the deposit at home feature ( I just uploaded 2 checks from my linux OS ) , " Heaton wrote in his original email to the bank .
Because of USAA 's current filtering system , Linux users must " trick " the system into believing they 're on Macintosh computers in order to get access , Heaton explained .
Indeed , several posts in the blogosphere -- such as on Miscfits and on an Ubuntu forum -- provide instructions to that effect .
A Minor Modification
" My goal is to enable Linux ( and other Unix ) users to be able to use the deposit@home functionality , thereby increasing your service to members of the bank , " Heaton added in the email .
" I was asking them to drop the requirement to pretend to be a Mac , because the system itself is really OS - agnostic , " he told LinuxInsider .
" I understand if they wo n't support Linux , but I wanted them at least to provide the opportunity to use other systems . "
Such a change would require a technical alteration to drop the filtering technology , but only a minimal one , he pointed out .
' Below 1 percent of Our Membership '
For many months , the bank appeared to believe that Heaton was asking it to begin supporting Linux .
" It would not be fiscally or financially responsible of our company to spend resources training our team members to support Linux / Unix systems at this time , " wrote bank representative Anthony Garza in an email response to Heaton last July , for example .
" This is because statistical logs show that a majority of our membership utilize Windows / MAC systems .
Our Linux / Unix users are below 1 % of our total membership statistically . "
Similarly , " USAA will continue to monitor the number of Linux users attempting to access the D@H system , " the bank 's Mark Voelkel added earlier this month .
" If we see a significant increase in the amount of Linux users trying to access the Deposit@Home system , we will then explore the option opening up access for this operating system . "
' You Will Never See Me '
Heaton , for his part , reasserted many times that it is simply the choice to use unsupported configurations that he 's requesting .
" By all means refuse to provide me support ; however , do n't restrict me from operating on my own , which is clearly the case as is , " he wrote in an email last month .
" If I can pretend to be a Macintosh computer and still use your site effectively ( as all who follow the same published steps can ) , it means your restriction is a policy decision and not a technical issue . "
Heaton also noted that it would be difficult to monitor the number of Linux users trying to access the system , since they are forced to do so under cover .
" The number of women using the men 's bathroom will always be low ... " he pointed out .
" Why ?
Because women are n't allowed to use the men's bathroom . "
Similarly , " when I use the D@H feature ( which I do ) , I masquerade as a Macintosh computer , " he added .
" That means you will never see me trying to use the D@H feature as a linux user . "
A New Ray of Light
Early this week , Heaton told LinuxInsider it looked like the confusion may have finally been cleared up , and that the bank may now understand that it 's not Linux support that he 's requesting .
On Monday , he was optimistic that he might soon get a positive response in light of that new understanding .
When asked by LinuxInsider , USAA spokesperson Paul Berry said , " this is the first I 've heard of anyone using Linux or any other system having trouble " with Deposit@Home .
' A Much Longer Process '
The bank does not currently support Linux for its Deposit@Home service , company spokesperson Lisa Carr confirmed , though she added that " we 're always considering ways to expand the services we offer to additional platforms . "
Will that include Linux in the near future ?
Only time will tell .
Luckily , Heaton is a patient man .
" Originally my goal was eventually to say how I got an institution to adopt Linux , " Heaton recounted .
" It 's been a much longer process than I envisioned . "
SAN FRANCISCO ( Reuters ) - A challenge to California ’s gay marriage ban failed on Monday to qualify for the 2010 ballot , leaving gay activists mulling a 2012 push and hoping a federal court will overturn the measure before then .
Los Angeles - based Love Honor Cherish carried out a volunteer - driven signature - gathering effort after large groups decided there was not enough time to ensure victory this year , even with some polls showing more than 50 percent support for same - sex marriage .
A 150 - day period to gather signatures to place the question on the ballot ended on Monday .
Courts and state legislatures have legalized same - sex marriage in five U.S. states and the District of Columbia , but popular votes have always rejected such unions , which are illegal in the vast majority of U.S. states .
California voters in November 2008 ended a summer of court - allowed gay marriage by enacting a ban on same - sex unions by a 52 to 48 percent vote .
The move by the trend - setting state enthused social conservatives and stunned lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender supporters nationwide .
A San Francisco federal court now is weighing whether the U.S. Constitution prohibits Proposition 8 , which defined marriage as a union of a man and a woman .
That battle is expected to be appealed up to the U.S. Supreme Court .
“ That trial I think is the most import single event in the modern LGBT equality movement , ” said Rick Jacobs , head of the Courage Campaign , speaking of the gay and lesbian movement .
His community organizing group considered a 2010 push but decided it was too soon .
“ If the court rules that Prop 8 is unconstitutional , that is going to catalyze folks on both sides , ” he said .
Many gay activists are wary of the Supreme Court bid , fearing conservative justices would not support their cause .
Love Honor Cherish Executive Director John Henning said if voters overturned Proposition 8 in 2012 -- the next time a ballot measure could qualify -- it could effectively take the issue out of the Court ’s hands .
“ I ’d rather repeal Prop 8 than see the Supreme Court review it , given the current composition of the court , ” Henning said .
Results from the BELLE collaboration at the KEK particle accelerator in Japan hint at a tetraquark ( Image : KEK )
The keepers at Particle Zoo should ready a new enclosure .
Particle hunters are claiming a sighting of a beast of legend – the tetraquark .
A jumbo particle made up of four quarks , it is a hitherto undiscovered form of matter .
Tetraquarks were first posited to exist over 30 years ago , as solutions to the equations of quantum chromodynamics .
QCD is a theory developed to describe how quarks combine to make two - quark mesons , such as pions and kaons , and three - quark baryons like protons or neutrons .
Although QCD allows for particles made of higher numbers of quarks , such exotic variants have remained in the wild because the physicists hunting them lacked instruments with the power and sensitivity to detect them .

Popping up
In 2003 , results from the BELLE collaboration at the KEK particle accelerator in Tsukuba , Japan , hinted at the existence of a pentaquark .
Subsequent analyses of data from other experiments seemed to confirm this , but other groups were unable to recreate Belle ’s results .
As the pentaquark evidence dried up , a number of possible tetraquark sightings have been made by groups at KEK in Japan , the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory in Stanford , California , and D - Zero at the Fermilab accelerator in Illinois .
Now Ahmed Ali of the German Electron Synchrotron ( DESY ) in Hamburg , Germany , and his colleagues have found another tetraquark candidate while looking to explain an anomaly reported in 2008 .
BELLE researchers had collided beams of electrons and positrons in an attempt to create an energetic form of “ bottomonium ” – a meson made of a bottom quark and its antiparticle .
Their product of their collisions , however , decayed much faster than predicted .
Twice as massive
Ali and colleagues found that if a tetraquark made of one bottom quark , one up quark , and each of their anti-particles was created instead of bottomonium , the faster decay could be explained .
“ This is the sought after tetraquark , ” says Ali .
The proposed particle is over twice as massive as previous specimens .
According to Ken Hicks of Ohio University in Athens , the team ’s result supports a growing body of evidence for the tetraquark ’s existence .
“ Everyone is dead sure that this particular state exists , ” he says .
However , he adds that there is still debate over whether the team have seen a pure particle or a “ meson molecule ” – a pair of two - quark mesons orbiting each other .
Ali says he expects observations from the Large Hadron Collider will provide additional statistical support for the tetraquark ’s existence .

Wilson responded , “ I watched Carole ( with an e ) in the Legislature Q- period and I have to say it was tragic .
Sorry - but it really was . ”
Asked last week during his visit to the legislature if he was planning a comeback , he joked ( it seemed ) that he was there to re-register the PDA .
In the 1996 election the PDA won less than six percent of the popular vote .
Wilson , the only PDA candidate to win a seat , joined the NDP in 1997 .

A SWEDISH tourist was killed yesterday when he fell 150 minto the crater of Mount Batur , an active volcano on the Indonesian tourist island of Bali .
The 25 - year - old man slipped as he tried to peer into the crater after a dawn trek to the summit , which climbs to 1700 m on the north - eastern side of the island , police said .
" He was looking into the crater , slipped and fell 150 m , " local police chief Made Oka said .
He said emergency responders were at the scene and were trying recover the tourist 's body using ropes .
Police were unable to provide the man 's name .
Mount Batur is easy to climb compared to some other volcanoes in Indonesia and has become popular with day - trippers on Bali .

The type specimen
A moth new to science and found nowhere else in the world has been formally recognised as living in the UK .
The 3 mm - long micro moth , which lives in Hembury Woods in Devon , was recognised as a new species this year .
This week , the biologist who discovered it is presenting the Natural History Museum of London with one of the first known specimens .
The receipt of this " type " specimen will mark the official acceptance of the moth 's existence in the country .
The tiny micro moth , which has a wingspan of just 6 mm , was first spotted in 2004 .
Hembury Woods : home to the moth
At that time , amateur naturalist Bob Heckford sighted the unusual bright green caterpillars of this tiny leaf - mining moth on oak saplings within Hembury Woods , a site managed by the National Trust .
In January this year , the moth was officially recognised in the journal Zookeys as a new species , named Ectoedemia heckfordi after its discoverer .
It is not known to live outside of the UK .
Official presentation
Now Mr Heckford is presenting the Natural History Museum with the original specimen .
That is important , because it marks the official acknowledgement by the scientific world of the specimen as the " type " for that species , against which any future finds will be compared and determined .
" We hear so much about the losses to the natural world , and less about the gains ; which makes this find , however small , so important , " says Matthew Oates , an adviser on nature conservation at the National Trust .
" Amateur naturalists have a wonderful window on the wildlife world and nature continues to amaze us and throw up surprises even in the UK . "
There are well over 2,000 species of micro moth in the UK .
They come in various shapes and sizes , but many are extremely pretty , though only appreciated under magnification .
A few are actually larger than some larger , so - called macro moths .
Dark mines made by the caterpillar of the species
Their biology varies .
Most are plant feeders , with larvae often mining galleries in leaves , between the leaf surfaces .
A few mine stems .
Some , though , breed in fungi and a few have aquatic larvae .
Most are nocturnal but quite a few also fly by day .
Caterpillars of the new species are found mostly on oak saplings and low growth of oak in the shade .
The mines they make are quite dark and the caterpillars are bright green which is quite unusual for micro moths .
The adults lay their eggs on the underside of the leaf .

In its first five years in orbit , NASA 's Swift satellite has given astronomers more than they could have hoped for .
Its discoveries range from a nearby nascent supernova to a blast so far away that it happened when our universe was only 5 percent of its present age .
Swift primarily studies gamma-ray bursts ( GRBs ) -- the biggest and most mysterious explosions in the cosmos .
On April 13 , the spacecraft 's " burst- o- meter " cataloged its 500th GRB .
" On the one hand , it 's just a number , but on the other it is a remarkable milestone , " said Neil Gehrels , Swift 's lead researcher at Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt , Md. " Each burst has turned over a new piece of the puzzle and a clearer picture is emerging . "
" Over five years and 500 bursts , Swift has fulfilled every significant promise of its mission and , in addition , brought a wealth of surprises , " noted Derek Fox , a Swift team member at Penn State in University Park , Pa. Burst 500 , officially known as GRB 100413B , exploded in constellation Cassiopeia as a long burst , a type usually associated with the death of a massive star .
It was n't detected in on - board analysis of data from the spacecraft 's Burst Alert Telescope ( BAT ) , which was interrupted 18 seconds after the burst as Swift slewed to a pre-planned target .
Instead , GRB 100413B came to light when David Palmer , an astrophysicist at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico , later analyzed the data .
" The BAT team regularly digs through the data once it comes to the ground and finds weak bursts like this one that take a bit of special care , " said Goddard 's Judith Racusin , who coordinated burst observations that day .
Summaries of other notable bursts in Swift 's storied career are listed below .
Swift 's main job is to quickly localize each gamma-ray burst , report its position so that others can immediately conduct follow - up observations , and then study the burst using its X -ray and Ultraviolet / Optical telescopes .
But it does much more , including ultraviolet studies of exploding stars , monitoring black holes and neutron stars for surges of high - energy radiation , and carrying out a long - term X - ray survey of the entire sky .
The spacecraft rocketed into orbit in November 2004 .
Managed by NASA 's Goddard Space Flight Center , Swift was built and is operated in collaboration with Penn State , the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico , and General Dynamics of Gilbert , Ariz .
Other partners include the University of Leicester and Mullard Space Science Laboratory in the United Kingdom , Brera Observatory and the Italian Space Agency in Italy , with additional collaborators in Germany and Japan .
Because gamma rays are the highest - energy form of light , the brief but brilliant blasts represent a colossal energy release .
Gamma -ray bursts were discovered in 1967 by unclassified military satellites designed to look for clandestine nuclear tests .
The first observations required extensive analysis to be sure that the bursts were truly originating beyond the solar system , and they were n't published until 1973 .
Over the following years , astronomers learned that sufficiently sensitive instruments could detect about two bursts per day , on average , somewhere in the sky .
Of those twice - daily GRBs , Swift 's Burst Alert Telescope snares about one in eight for detailed study .
According to Lorella Angelini , a Goddard astrophysicist now developing a comprehensive burst database , the number of recorded GRBs is approaching 6,000 .
Yet if one considers only bursts with measured distances , Swift 's share of the total is a whopping 75 percent .
An earlier NASA satellite , the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory , showed that bursts come in long and short varieties , with long bursts ( those lasting longer than two seconds ) outnumbering short bursts three to one .
Compton also showed that bursts occur randomly and evenly over the sky .
Maps of GRB distribution bear no hint of our galaxy 's structure .
This means that they are extremely far away — and all the more powerful .
A key breakthrough in understanding GRBs came from the Italian - Dutch satellite Beppo - SAX , which in 1997 provided the first precise burst positions .
It later discovered lingering X - ray emission -- dubbed " afterglows " -- at burst locations .
Observatories on the ground quickly discovered afterglows in visible light , which provided information that confirmed the burst 's enormous distances .
Astronomers now regularly study afterglows across the electromagnetic spectrum .
Most of the time , the hard task of measuring burst distances falls to ground - based observatories , which can target a burst 's location with telescopes far larger than the Ultraviolet / Optical Telescope aboard Swift .
" Getting on the afterglows quickly with large ground - based telescopes remains a key element in understanding GRBs , " said Fox , whose research focuses on follow - up observations .
" It 's this synergy between Swift and ground observatories that has really moved the ball forward , especially for short bursts .
" And the farther the burst , the more important rapid ground follow - up becomes .
At distances greater than about 12 billion light - years , gas clouds block ultraviolet wavelengths before they can reach Earth , and all optical light becomes shifted into infrared wavelengths only detectable by specially - equipped ground - based telescopes .
Astronomers scramble to detect afterglow from new bursts as soon as they can .
" Thanks to such efforts , we know Swift has seen GRBs as close as about 100 million light - years and as far away as 13 billion light - years , " adds Gehrels .
Put another way , Swift sees gamma-ray bursts over a span of time equivalent to about 95 percent of the universe 's age .
By the time Swift launched , mounting evidence already pointed to the deaths of massive stars as the source of most long GRBs -- a scenario that still stands .
When such a star runs out of fuel , its core collapses and likely forms a black hole surrounded by a dense hot disk of gas called an accretion disk .
Somehow , the black hole diverts part of the infalling matter into a pair of high - energy jets that tear through the collapsing star .
The jets move so fast -- upwards of 99.9 percent the speed of light -- that collisions within them produce gamma rays .
As the jet breaches the star 's surface , a gamma - ray burst is born .
The jet continues on , later striking gas beyond the star to produce afterglows .
Short bursts , however , proved much harder to pin down .
" We did n't know their most basic properties , " notes Ehud Nakar , an astrophysicist at Tel Aviv University in Israel .
" We knew so little we were n't even sure that short GRBs were a unique astrophysical phenomenon .
" It turns out they are .
" Long GRBs originate from the collapse of stars just millions of years old , but the objects that give rise to some short GRBs reach ages of billions of years before exploding , " Nakar adds .
The emerging picture is that short GRBs arise when two compact objects -- either a pair of neutron stars or a neutron star and a black hole -- collide and merge .
These objects , which are the crushed cores of exploded stars , pack more mass than the sun into volumes just a few miles across .
For those bound in a binary system , Einstein 's relativity seals their fate .
According to Einstein , massive orbiting objects give off a type of energy called gravitational radiation .
Although no one has yet detected these waves , astronomers have observed an effect predicted by this energy loss -- the slowly shrinking orbits of binary neutron stars .
Over billions of years , the stellar cinders grow ever closer and finally merge in an event that unleashes titanic energies and creates a short GRB .
But Nakar thinks the full picture still eludes astronomers .
" So far , the data favor merging neutron stars , and that is certainly the most popular idea , but other scenarios remain possible .
We still do not know the origin of short GRBs .
" Thanks mainly to burst identifications from Swift and the afterglow observations they make possible , scientists now have details on dozens of short bursts and their afterglows .
" We 're now beginning to understand the home galaxies of short GRBs , " Fox said .
Over the past five years , Swift has delivered a great deal of revolutionary science .
But its career is n't over yet -- and with a little luck , there will be much more to come .
April 13 , 2010 : NASA 's Swift discovers its 500th burst .
GRB 100413B is a long burst in the constellation Cassiopeia .
April 23 , 2009 : GRB 090423 in Leo holds the record for the farthest burst yet known -- 13.04 billion light - years away .
" The burst is beyond the farthest confirmed galaxies and quasars , making it the most distant object we know in the universe today , " Fox said .
This find validates models suggesting that galaxy and star formation were well under way in the universe 's first billion years and that some early stars died as bursts .
March 19 , 2008 : GRB 080319B , in Boötes , is truly extraordinary .
It produces enough light to be seen briefly with the unaided eye , cresting at visual magnitude 5.3 despite occurring 7.5 billion light - years away -- or more than halfway across the visible universe .
Scientists conclude that one of its particle jets appears to have been aimed squarely at Earth .
July 14 , 2007 : GRB 070714B explodes in Taurus .
Afterglow observations indicate a distance of 7.3 billion light - years , making this one of the farthest short bursts to date .
Feb. 18 , 2006 : GRB 060218 explodes in Aries 450 million light - years away -- in our back yard , cosmically speaking .
Although faint , the burst emits detectable gamma rays for more than 40 minutes and detectable optical and X - ray emission lasts more than 10 days .
The event is a hybrid , showing characteristics of both a GRB and a supernova , and leads to the best observations yet exploring connections between these phenomena .
Sept. 4 , 2005 : At a distance of 12.77 billion light - years , GRB 050904 , located in Pisces , is the farthest - known GRB at the time , the first of many such Swift records .
May 9 , 2005 : GRB 050509B , in Coma Berenices , erupts with a flash of gamma-rays that lasts just 0.03 second .
Swift turns to the burst fast enough to detect 11 X - ray photons , making this the first short burst with a detected afterglow .

Forget stitches and old - school sutures .
The Air Force is funding scientists who are using nano - technology and lasers to seal up wounds at a molecular level .
It might sound like Star Trek tech , but it 's actually the latest in a series of ambitious Pentagon efforts to create faster , more effective methods of treating war - zone injuries .
Last year , the military 's research agency , Darpa , requested proposals for instant injury repair using adult stem cells , and Pentagon scientists are already doing human trials of spray - on skin .
Massachusetts General Hospital researchers Irene Kochevar , Robert Redmond and dermatologist Sandy Tsao are behind the nano - tech project , which has been funded by various agencies within the Department of Defense for eight years .
They 've successfully tried out the nano - sutures in lab experiments and a clinical trial of 31 patients in need of skin incisions .
The process would replace the sutures and staples traditionally used to repair wounded skin .
Instead of being sealed up with a needle and thread , a patient 's wound would be coated in a dye , then exposed to green light for 2 - 3 minutes .
The dye absorbs the light and catalyzes molecular bonds between the tissue 's collagen .
The bonds instantly create a seal that 's watertight , which prevents inflammation or risk of infection , and speeds up the formation of scar tissue .
" It 's so simple , but such an improvement on current processes , and that 's what 's really remarkable , " Kochevar told Danger Room .
The process uses a hand - held laser device that 's about a foot long and a few inches wide .
Penetrating eye wounds , like shrapnel injuries , could also benefit from a patch version of the treatment .
A biological membrane stained with dye would be applied over the eye , and quickly sealed using the laser until a soldier could undergo more intensive surgery .
" We 're so close to these processes being used , " Kochevar said .
" But FDA approval is still a real hurdle . "
Next up , the researchers want to try out the procedure in more invasive surgeries and conduct more extensive testing on people , in hopes of fast - tracking war - zone use .
They 've applied for funding to conduct human trials on nerve repair .
" Superficial wound healing is impressive , but a continuous molecular seal of a nerve or in a corneal implant would be a profound leap , " Kochevar said .

So back in 1995 , my parents bought their budding artist son a blank hardcover sketch book .
I did n't know ( and still really do n't ) whether or not you 're supposed to justin a sketch book that nice , so I felt guilty just doodling .
I was n't really anartist , seeing as how most of my sketches involved stick figures being murdered in one horrible fashion or another , or cartoon people missing limbs with anime - proportioned geysers of blood shooting out of their mangled stumps ( all of this before I saw Ninja Scroll , even .
I was ahead of my time ) .
So I thought , " what can I do with this beautiful book so as not to waste it on my stupid doodles ?

Once upon a time , not too long ago , renewable - energy projects sized in kilowatts ( kW ) were considered large .
The biggest solar array in 1963 had a mere 242 watts of capacity , and was installed on a lighthouse in Japan .
Wind power , which took off more quickly , reached its first 100 - kilowatt system in 1931 , in Yalta , then part of the Soviet Union .
And at that time , wave and tidal power plants were still twinkles in researchers ’ eyes .
But renewable - energy projects have grown inexorably larger , from kW - size systems to megawatt - size systems and now to gigawatt - size systems .
“ It ’s just the natural progression of what ’s happened to renewable energy , ” said Clean Edge principal Ron Pernick , a firm that picked “ megaprojects ” as one of its top five trends for 2010 .
Starting with 150 - kW wind turbines at Altamont Pass in California , one of the first U.S. wind projects , turbines have grown to 3.5 MW and even 5 MW today , he said , and solar projects have expanded from off - grid homes to commercial and industrial buildings and now to utility - scale solar farms .
The gigantic renewable systems in the works today match – and in some cases even exceed – the size and scope of some conventional fossil - fuel power plants .
If they materialize , these projects will represent a major turning point , as renewable energy becomes just , well …energy .
The Reason for Growth
Why do renewable energy projects seem to get bigger and bigger ?
The most obvious answer is cost , said Marianne Boust , a senior analyst at IHS Emerging Energy Research ( EER ) .
“ When you start a project , you have to do a lot of studies [ and paperwork ] , so companies are looking at larger projects to amortize those upfront costs , ” she said .
In addition , the high cost of building transmission to ferry power from a wind farm to the grid , for example , works out more cheaply , compared to revenues , if the project is bigger , she added .
Another big reason for the growth has been government policies .
As federal , state and local governments set ambitious renewable - energy goals and create incentives to encourage them , larger utility - scale projects are cropping up , Pernick said .
China is a critical player , aggressively developing very large projects – many in the GW size – projected to go online in the next few years , he added .
And in the United States , utilities are getting involved in creating huge projects to meet state renewable portfolio standards while innovative financing models also are helping push larger projects .
Of course , not every proposed project will get completed — far from it .
Transmission has been a major obstacle for many big projects , with one of the most public transmission - related failures being T. Boone Picken ’s plans to build the largest U.S. wind farm in Texas earlier this year .
Financing has been another daunting challenge in the recession , and large projects have large upfront costs , even if the cost per kW - hour ends up being cheaper .
New technologies tend to have a tougher time than more - proven technologies in today ’s risk - averse climate .
“ There are clearly financial challenges — we ’re not out of the woods — but we ’re certainly seeing some projects get done and we expect to see quite a few more happen in the next few years , ” Pernick said .
“ The fact that there are some wind farms and solar PV installations approaching the gigawatt scale shows that it ’s not just pie in the sky ; it will be possible to get there . ”
The Biggest of the Big
We ’ve sifted through announcements , spoken with experts and rounded up the hugest of the huge : the largest dream projects that developers have proposed in five different categories : solar , wind , geothermal , wave and tidal .
While we ’ve focused on projects with evidence of at least some chance of success , it ’s unlikely that all of these biggest planned projects will succeed .
Their very massiveness makes them challenging , but their vision and audacity also makes them inspiring — and potentially important milestones to launch renewables into their next phase .
And in cases where they fail big , they will also illustrate — and underline — the remaining challenges in a way that smaller projects could n’t .
Take a look at five visions of what the future could look like for the renewable energy industry .
SOLAR : Desertec , North Africa and the Middle East — 100 GW
At a scale that spans three continents , Desertec may well be the most ambitious renewable - energy project ever proposed .
The concept seems simple enough : huge concentrating solar - thermal projects in the Sahara Desert and other sunny areas in Africa and the Middle East will supply the whole region , including Europe , Africa and the Middle East , with electricity via high - voltage direct - current transmission lines .
Wind farms on the coast of Europe and Africa , as well as geothermal , photovoltaic , hydropower and biomass projects , mainly in Europe , will help balance out the grid ’s power supply , but the concentrating solar - thermal projects will make up the largest piece — 100 GW , or the equivalent of 100 nuclear power stations .
But putting together such a vast project , really made up of dozens ( or even hundreds ) of separate projects connected by the all - encompassing intercontinental transmission lines , is anything but simple .
The challenges can hardly be overstated .
Creating such a large grid — agreeing on electricity standards across , not only cities and provinces , but different countries and even continents — and hashing out how to share the costs and benefits of building , maintaining and managing it is a gargantuan task rife with political landmines .
Issues of national energy security are involved .
The logistics of building so much solar power , of getting the materials , the people and the planning in place , is nearly unfathomable .
And then there ’s the cost : an estimated $ 555 billion .
The project might sound like nothing but a hazy dream , unlikely to materialize , except for the fact that a consortium of a dozen big companies , including Siemens , Munich Re , E.ON , RWE and Deutsche Bank , last year signed an agreement to try to raise the money .
That ’s not money in the bank , however .
Aside from an expected 1 billion euros from the European Union , it will take plenty of government and private funding to make the project happen , and the donation buttons on the website make it clear the Desertec foundation is collecting wherever it can .
The consortium does n’t even plan to complete the plan to raise the money until 2012 .
And even with the funding , the project is expected to take decades , with the goal of completion by 2050 .
WIND : Dogger Bank , UK — 9 GW
Moving wind - power projects offshore opens up vast amounts of space and also the potential to take advantage of steadier , faster - moving wind .
The largest such project in the pipeline today is the Dogger Bank development , which is part of the United Kingdom ’s third round of offshore wind licensing , according to EER .
The project , with a whopping target installation capacity of 9 GW — and the potential for some 13 GW — blows away the current largest wind farm , a 782 - megawatt onshore farm in Roscoe , Texas , that was completed in October 2009 .
Forewind , a consortium of major energy companies including Scottish and Southern Energy , RWE Innogy ’s RWE npower Renewables subsidiary , Statoil and Statkraft , won the license to develop the Dogger Bank zone in January .
The site is 3343 square miles large , 77 to 150 miles from shore , with depths of between 59 and 206 feet , and its unparalleled size , distance and depth create a number of logistical challenges in constructing the project and connecting it to the grid .
Make no mistake , this project is years away from completion .
Forewind has n’t had set a target opening date , but has said it plans to make initial investment decisions about the project in 2014 .
TIDAL : Incheon , South Korea — 1.32 GW
Completed in 1966 , the first tidal power plant in the world , France ’s 240 - MW Rance plant , remains the largest today .
Now South Korea is planning a project more than five times as large in the Incheon Bay .
GS Engineering and Construction Corp. ( GS E&C ) , a publicly traded company based in nearby Seoul , said in January that it plans to begin building the Incheon tidal plant in the second half of next year , if regulators approve the project .
Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power Co. will run the plant , expected to cost $ 3.4 billion and start operations in 2017 .
The project involves a barrage , or an ocean dam , which traps water in a basin and uses turbines to make electricity from the water - level difference created by the tides .
As countries aim to get more electricity from renewable sources , it ’s possible that another project , the U.K. ’s proposed Severn Barrage , could surpass the South Korean plant .
The project , which could install up to 10 miles of dams and sluice gates across the Severn Estuary , has been bandied about for nearly 30 years and a timeline remains uncertain .
The government is considering five different ideas for the barrage , ranging from 1.05 to 8.6 GW in capacity , as well as three alternate concepts .
Tidal power interests utilities because it is reliable – the tides occur twice a day without fail — and although it is not considered constant , or baseload , power .
But both the Incheon and Severn projects face significant environmental concerns and opposition .
Like river dams , these tidal barrages have caused some unintended environmental and ecological consequences , making them unpopular with environmentalists .
For one thing , they reduce the flow of water from the tides and the exchange of water from the basins , which impacts the water , the surrounding wetlands and the wildlife that lives in them .
Other types of tidal - power technologies — including underwater turbines that operate like wind turbines , using the current itself to generate electricity without needing a barrage — could help avoid those issues , but such technologies are still under development .
Three 200 - MW projects are racing for the title of the largest tidal - current project .
Utility SSE Renewables in March won a bid to develop two such projects in the UK ’s Pentland Firth off Scotland ’s northern coast : one on what ’s called the Westray South site and the other , in partnership with Irish tidal - energy company OpenHydro , on the Cantick Head site .
SSE ’s already raised some £ 3.8 billion in bonds , loans and stock offering proceeds to support all its renewable projects .
Meanwhile , Crest Energy has applied for approval to install up to 200 submerged turbines near the entrance of the Kaipara Harbour , on the northwestern site of New Zealand ’s North Island .

GEOTHERMAL : Sarulla , Indonesia 330 MW
After a series of delays since the project was first announced in 2006 , it looks like an $ 800 million geothermal project slated for North Sumatra is finally underway .
The consortium of companies developing the project , headed by Indonesian oil and gas company Medco Energi Internasional , in April announced it has negotiated an agreement to sell the power to PT Perusahaan Listrik Negara , a state - owned power company , for a levelized price of 6.79 cents per kilowatt - hour .
The talks had held up the project , originally expected to be completed next year , for the last four years , and the price will still need to win regulatory approval before the project can go forward .
But barring financial or regulatory difficulties , the consortium plans to finish the project in five years , with the first phase — representing about one - third of the capacity — beginning operations within three years .
Aside from Medco , the consortium includes Nevada - based Ormat Technologies ( NYSE : ORA ) , Japan - based Itochu Corp. and Japan - based Kyushu Electric Power Co .
Even when it ’s finished , the 330 - MW project — which EER called the largest planned project with advanced development — will seem small compared to the Geysers in California , which is the largest project ever completed .
The capacity of the geothermal field at the Geysers started out at 1.5 GW when it was first developed in the 1970s , then peaked at 2 GW in 1987 before sinking back to about 700 MW today due to poor maintenance , according to EER .
Why is the largest planned geothermal project today smaller than the current largest project ?
The Geysers was originally developed as multiple projects — not a single project , although it ’s now maintained by one company , Calpine , which is working to expand the production by up to 80 MW .
The Geysers consists of 19 facilities spread over the geothermal field .
The Sarulla project ’s 330 MW make it the world ’s largest single - contract geothermal project so far , which Ormat pointed out back in 2006 .
And it has a point .
But it ’s also true that geothermal project sizes are indeed falling , at least in the United States , because some of the sites with the best resources — such as the Geysers — have already been tapped , EER says .
Meanwhile , in places like New Zealand and Indonesia , which have better resources , project sizes will likely get larger .
Indonesia is aggressively pursuing more geothermal , targeting a whopping 4 GW by 2014 .
Cost remains a challenge , as geothermal competes largely with cheap , but dirty , coal in the developing country .
But geothermal remains highly alluring because it provides constant , not intermittent , power at a lower potential cost than solar or wind .
WAVE : Orkney , Scotland , 200 MW
Clean - energy developer SSE Renewables is in an enviable position – it ’s tied with itself for the title of the largest wave project in development today .
In March , the company won exclusive rights to lease two sites in the U.K. ’s Pentland Firth , an area off the northwestern coast of Scotland ’s Orkney , for wave projects .
It ’s building a 200 - MW wave farm at the Costa Head site and is also partnering with Scottish ocean - energy company Aquamarine Power to develop the Brough Head site .
SSE holds a 47 percent stake in Aquamarine .
At Brough Head , the companies plan to install clusters of Aquamarine ’s Oyster ( left ) wave - power devices , which look like hinged rafts that flap as waves pass , driving hydraulic pistons that in turn spin a conventional hydro-electric turbine .
The wave farm is expected to begin operations in 2013 .
Including this project , the partners have signed an agreement to develop up to 1 GW of such wave farms together in the U.K. and in Ireland by 2020 .
SSE Renewables has n’t yet said whether its Costa Head project would also use Aquamarine ’s Oysters , only saying it is working with partners and stakeholders to come up with a more specific plan for the site .
Wave power has long been an attractive concept because of the large area of the global covered by oceans , the constantly moving nature of waves — which could deliver dependable baseload power , instead of the intermittent power of solar and wind — and the potentially low cost .
But so far , the technologies have faced challenges , including cost and reliability issues .
For one thing , sea conditions ( think constantly moving saltwater ) can be very rough on equipment , and maintenance and repairs more expensive than if the same equipment was easily accessible on land .
Still , as governments push for more renewable energy , several companies and utilities are working on demonstration projects around the world .

Well , well .
I heard something about this on the radio this morning , but was n’t clear about what ’s going on .
This post makes things a bit clearer .
Last week , the Lib - Dem candidate Nick Clegg — the third party candidate in the race — did so well in a television debate that he began to emerge as the logical alternative to Labor .
This has caused the Murdoch papers to unleash a full - scale attack on Clegg — with hardly any pretense other than to help Cameron — now known as the “ Kill Klegg ” campaign .
In turn , the Independent newspaper ran a front pager yesterday with the headline “ Rupert Murdoch will not decide the outcome of the election .
You will , ” challenging the Murdoch coverage of the race .
Later in the afternoon , in a coming - apart - at - the - seams scenario , Rebekah Wade / Brooks and Murdoch ’s son , James — who will both face the wrath of Murdoch senior if they do n’t produce a winner — stormed over to the Independent , breached its security systems , barged into the offices of the Independent ’s editor - in - chief and top executive , Simon Kelner , and commenced , in Brit - speak , a giant row .
Their point was that newspaper publishers do n’t slag off other newspaper publishers in polite Britain , but also the point was to remind Kelner that he was n’t just slagging off another publisher , he was slagging off the Murdochs , damn it .
Indeed , the high point of the screaming match was Wade / Brooks , in a fit of apoplexy and high drama , neck muscles straining , saying to Kelner : “ And I invited you to Blenheim in the first place ! ”
Blenheim being the Murdoch family retreat and the highest social destination for all Murdoch loyalists and ambitious Brits in the media .
And all the pundits thought that the IMF would be on the hook for just € 10 billion ...
The IMF has just announced that it is expanding its New Arrangement to Borrow ( NAB ) multilateral facility from its existing $ 50 billion by a whopping $ 500 billion ( SDR333.5 billion ) , to $ 550 billion .
The current lending participant group of 26 entities will be increased by 13 new members all of whom will contribute token amount of capital to the NAB .
The one country most on the hook in the new and revised NAB - the United States of America , will provide over $ 105 billion in total commitments , or 20 % of the total facility .
The US is currently on the hook for just $ 10 billion , meaning its participation in global bail outs just increased by $ 95 billion .
And the bulk of these bailouts will certainly be located across the Atlantic .
What is most troublesome is the massive expansion of the NAR .
If the IMF believes that over half a trillion in short - term funding is needed imminently , is all hell about to break loose .
Never one to present a realistic picture Dominique ( or is that Mrs , Pisani ? )
Strauss - Khan said : " The expansion and enlargement of the NAB borrowing arrangements provides a very strong multilateral foundation for the Fund ’s efforts in crisis prevention and resolution , as an essential back - stop to the Fund ’s quota resources .
This will help ensure that the Fund has access to adequate resources to help members that are vulnerable to financial crises . "
If memory serves us right , the Fund 's current resources give it acces to about a third of a trillion , so as of today the IMF has recourse funding to just under a trillion .
Something big must be coming .
Some more details on the NAB from the just released PR :
The NAB is a standing set of credit arrangements under which participants commit resources to IMF lending when these are needed to supplement quota resources .
The expanded NAB will become operational when it receives formal acceptances from the required proportion of current and potential participants , which will require legislative backing in some cases .
1
“ The expansion of the NAB will make an important contribution to global financial stability , but it is not a substitute for a general increase in the Fund ’s quota resources .
The Fund is , and shall remain , a quota - based institution .
It is important now that member countries rapidly take the necessary steps to make the increased resources available , ” Mr. Strauss - Kahn underscored .
Background
The NAB is a credit arrangement between the IMF and a group of members and institutions to provide supplementary resources to the IMF when these are needed to forestall or cope with an impairment of the international monetary system .
The NAB is supplementary to quota resources , which are made up of the quota subscriptions each country pays upon joining the Fund , broadly based on its relative size in the world economy .
IMF members ’ quotas currently total SDR 217.4 billion ( about US $ 330 billion ) .
Like quota allocations , the NAB is reviewed on a regular basis .
The recent unprecedented shock confronting the global economy has led to a sharp increase in the demand for IMF financing .
To ensure that the IMF continues to have sufficient resources to meet demand , leaders of the G - 20 agreed in April 2009 that immediate financing from members of US $ 250 billion would subsequently be folded into an expanded and more flexible NAB , increased by up to $ 500 billion .
This call was endorsed by the IMFC .
The G - 20 leaders reaffirmed their commitment on September 25 , 2009 to a tripling of the resources available to the IMF , from a pre-crisis level of about US $ 250 billion .
At its meeting in October 2009 , the IMFC welcomed the expected agreement to expand and enhance the NAB .
Pending the entering into force of the expanded NAB , member countries have pledged more than $ 300 billion in immediate bilateral financing should the Fund require additional resources for lending .
We have a few questions :
1 ) Just where will central banks suddenly find access to over three hundred billion in SDRs ( which is what this facility is based on ) ?
Also , we are curious just how this SDR expansion will impact dollar levels .
As the dollar is the primary component in the SDR basket ( 17 % ) , banks will have to sell more dollars than other currencies on a pro rata basis to increase their SDR holdings .
What will happen to the DXY when $ 85 billion new dollars flood the market via assorted CBs but mostly the FRBNY ?
2 ) Who came up with the expansion factor ?
Why is Japan 's allocation increasing by 18.7x , that of the US by 10.4x , while that of the Bundesbank only by 7.2 x ?
We thought the IMF is more of a eurocentric bailout facility ?
Why does it fall upon the US taxpayers to disproprtionately bailout Greece ?
3 ) What is the joke with having Greece join the group of new participants ?
The IMF sure has a sick sense of humor .
4 ) Curious how this comes the day before Greece is supposed to auction off some ultra -short term debt .
If this facility is enacted , watch for socereign credit curves to hit 60 degrees , with near - term risk disappearing , once again courtesy of Joe Sixpack .
We hope you pay your taxes by the April 15 deadline .
5 ) Funny money will galore .
At this point nobody will allow anyone or anything to fail .
Here is the full table of old and existing contributors .
Congrats US - you are once again leading the charge in the world bailout .

Ilya Kovalchuk : “ We need to win now like never before ” ( Photo © Bruce Bennet / Getty Images )
Ilya Kovalchuk gave an interview to Russian newspaper Sovetskiy Sport where he talked about going to the World Championship without a contract in the NHL , his favorites to win the Stanley Cup , what Russian players agreed to do after failing at the Olympics .
RussianHockeyFans.com offers you a translation .
Many thought that you wo n’t play for the national team .
It is very risky as you do n’t have a contract for the next season in the NHL .
Besides your wife gave a birth to your son in March .
Was this decision hard to take ?
Kovalchuk : “ After failing in Vancouver all guys agreed to go to the World Championship if there is a chance .
We must win and make this season end well .
My wife Nicole understood me at once , told me that the whole family would be watching games on TV and cheer for us .
She and the kids stayed in Miami .
I spent a week there and flew to Russia . ”
Many teams will have either weak or very young rosters .
It will be easier for Team Russia to win the gold ?
Kovalchuk : “ In first place we have to think about our team .
It does n’t matter against whom we will play .
All teams will fight against Russia .
Especially the young guys , who will want to show themselves .
But our team is young too , we have Kulikov , Anisimov , Varlamov , Radulov , Ovechkin , Semin …
They are n’t old men , are they ? ”
But now there is more responsibility .
What if we lose to the youngsters from the USA team in playoffs ?
It will be a low blow like at the Olympics 1980 in Lake Placid .
What a shame it was …
Kovalchuk : “ You think the Americans will ice students against us ? ( laughs ) .
No way !
The USA will have a good team , as well as Canada will .
I saw the rosters , there is n’t a trace of the Miracle on Ice .
And besides I do n’t even want to think about losing , we are n’t going to Germany to lose . ”
Have you talked with Ovechkin and Semin ?
Kovalchuk : “ Yeah , right after the Capitals were eliminated from the playoffs .
I was really surprised that they lost to Montreal .
It ’s illogical when the 8th team in the East defeats the first .
But such surprises are usual for the NHL .
Every team has a chance .
The Canadiens fought hard and they deserved to advance to the second round . ”
Who is going to win the Stanley Cup now ?
Kovalchuk : “ I think it will be either San Jose or Chicago .
Most likely the Sharks .
They had hard time defeating Colorado in the first round but now they are 2 - 0 against Detroit and have good chances of getting into the semifinal .
Moreover , I think that the Sharks will be on fire later . ”
Do the coaches name the captain ?
Kovalchuk : “ We had and have the captain , it ’s Alexei Morozov .
It just happened so that this year he wo n’t be at the World Championship . ” ( Morozov is injured – RussianHockeyFans.com )
What would be your reaction if you became the captain ?
Kovalchuk : “ I was the captain in Atlanta , I know what it means .
But we have a lot of leaders in Team Russia .
You know , to win the gold you must have 22 captains on the team .
And it does n’t matter who has the C letter on his chest . ”
Some say that there should be no World Championship in the Olympics year .
What do you think ?
Kovalchuk : “ I do n’t agree .
A lot of our fans will go to Germany .
And besides , it will be a huge event for Europe .
Take the opening - game Germany – USA as an example !
It will be played in a football stadium , there will be 76,000 spectators !
It will go right into the Guinness World Records .
And who can say that we do n’t need such a championship ? ”
Russia ’s first game will be on May 9 against Slovakia .
Germany , 65 years since the Great Victory .
What does it mean for you ?
Kovalchuk : “ A lot !
The Victory Day is a marquee event for our country .
We must pleasure our veterans and fans .
My grandfather fought in the war .
He was a tankman , he reached Berlin .
When I was a kid he told me lots of stories about the war .
The WC final will take place in Cologne .
And let ’s hope that Russia will reach it ’s own Berlin — win the gold .
We need it now like never before . ”

Information was released by the Athletic Department regarding how to buy tickets for the 2010 football season .
This year , season tickets will cost students $ 218 .
The process is not extremely challenging , but missing any step in the process would mean spending much more money to buy either season tickets or individual tickets to each game .
Step One : Ticketmaster Account
To buy student season tickets , you will need a Ticketmaster account .
After you head to the Ticketmaster site , you will need to enter basic information about yourself .
While you do not have to enter credit card information at this point , it is advisable , as it will save time later on in the process .
Step Two : Pre-registration
If you are an incoming freshman or incoming transfer student , you do not need to pre-register .
However , for all other students , pre-registering is mandatory .
If you do not pre-register , you wo n’t be allowed to participate in the process to get student season tickets .
Pre-registration starts on May 27 at 8 a.m. and ends on June 2 at 5 p.m .
This time period applies to both undergraduates and graduates alike .
This Ticketmaster site will have the pre-registration during this time period .
Make sure to have your nine - digit student id number ready , as you will need it for both this step and the next .
Step Three : Buying the Tickets
There will be five different sale dates for the five different classes .
The dates for purchasing the tickets will be from June 21 - June 25 .
There are no official purchasing dates for each of the classes yet , but by going off of last year ’s order , we think it will be :
Seniors ( 91.1 credits or higher ) – Monday , June 21 .
Juniors ( 59.1 - 91 credits ) – Tuesday , June 22 .
Sophomores ( 27.1 - 59 credits ) – Wednesday , June 23 .
Freshmen ( 27 credits or less ) – Thursday , June 24 .
Graduate students – Friday , June 25 .
Final confirmation of the exact order will happen on May 20 .
Also on May 2o , the exact time on these dates that you can begin purchasing will be given out .
Again , if it ’s like last year , each class will start at 7 a.m. , except freshmen , who will start at 8 p.m .
All sales will be available at this Ticketmaster site .
Final Thoughts and Tips
As an extra word of advice , if you miss the very beginning time of your sale date , do n’t worry !
Last year , I woke up extremely late and was freaking out about not getting tickets .
However , a very wise person told me to try anyway .
It ended up that tickets were still available later during my available time slot .
So stay calm , follow these guidelines , and get your tickets !

Apple manufacturer Foxconn was today taking extraordinary measures to safeguard its business and workers following a spate of suicides at its sprawling plant in southern China .
Workers have reportedly been told to sign letters promising not to kill themselves and even agree to be institutionalised if they appeared to be in an " abnormal mental or physical state for the protection of myself and others " .
Protesters from several workers ' rights groups throw paper money in front of paper figures , depicting workers who recently died in apparent suicides , during a traditional Chinese mourning ceremony outside a Foxconn office in Hong Kong .
Nets were also reportedly being hung around buildings to deter suicidal employees .
The moves came after a 19 - year - old employee fell to his death at the Shenzhen factory on Tuesday -- the ninth apparent suicide at the enormous site this year .
In order to keep businesses from ending their drug coverage and dumping their retirees on the federal system , Congress provided a 28 percent reimbursement for the benefits .
And , the companies got to deduct the entire cost of the drug plans from their taxes .
Including the government subsidy .
Yes !
The job - killing tax increase in the new law involves no longer allowing big corporations to take a tax deduction for spending money we gave them .
Somehow , this does n’t seem to have the makings of a Tea Party rally .
But there ’s always the insurance mandate .
When it comes to roiling right - wing hysteria , nothing whips up a crowd like the law ’s requirement that everybody get health coverage .
Gov. C.L. “ Butch ” Otter of Idaho , who is definitely the winner of the Most Fun Name for a Governor Award , kicked off the rebellion this week by signing a law requiring the state to sue the federal government over this provision .
“ If it is the proper role for government to mandate that citizens buy certain products , then I ’m going to get potatoes in line for them just as quick as I can , ” Otter announced .
Idaho , you should not let your elected officials push the potato thing so hard .
The state has a lot more to talk about  lovely scenery , great people , the world ’s largest factory for barrel cheese , the smallest number of doctors per capita in the country .
And what about your state fruit , the huckleberry ?
About that insurance requirement .
Americans pay an estimated $ 42.7 billion a year in taxes and higher health care premiums because of the cost of medical treatment for the uninsured .
So you would think that conservatives in particular would believe that everybody ought to be held responsible for having their own coverage .
Unless they ’re starting a new cutting - edge Let Them Die in a Ditch Movement .
“ No more free - riders , ” Romney said frequently , back when he was a little more vocal about defending the Massachusetts plan .
Lately , he ’s been vaguer on the subject , and when it comes to the new federal law , he ’s jumped on the repeal bandwagon .
When someone from the liberal blog ThinkProgress asked Romney whether he thought the new federal insurance mandate  so very much like the Massachusetts one  was constitutional , he muttered something about it being “ a big topic ” and ducked into an elevator .
It ’s possible that he had n’t looked so uncomfortable since the time he was chased by a reporter who wanted to know if he thought Seamus the Irish setter had enjoyed driving to Canada on top of the family car .
This article is about the character .
Are you looking for the non-canon character , Maude Flanders ( ghost ) ?
“ I do n't judge Homer or Marge .
That 's for vengeful God to do . ” ― Maude Flanders[src ]
“ Neddy does n't believe in insurance .
He considers it a form of gambling . ” ― Maude Flanders[src ]
In many ways , Maude Flanders was a supporting player in our lives .
She did n't grab our attention with memorable catchphrases , or comical accents .
But , whether you noticed her or not , Maude was always there ... and we thought she always would be . ” ― Reverend Timothy Lovejoy at Maude 's funeral [src ]
“ Excuse me , Edna .
I do n't think we 're talking about love here .
We 're talking about S - E - X in front of the C - H - I - L - D - R - E - N. ” ― Maude Flanders[src ]
was the first wife of Ned Flanders and the late mother of Todd and Rod Flanders .
Maude was a devout Christian who once attended a Bible camp to learn how to be more judgmental , although she was n’t as preachy as her husband .
She campaigned strongly against Itchy and Scratchy with Marge and was often partnered with Helen Lovejoy as they protest against the " evils " in Springfield .
She died after being struck by a barrage of shirts fired from t- shirt cannons at the Springfield Speedway in " Alone Again , Natura - Diddily " .

Biography
Although she spent much of her free time in prayer and reading the Bible , Maude was known to let her hair ( and her neckline ) down for the occasional dinner party at the home of the Simpsons ( Maude 's neighbors ) .
Homer Simpson and Moe Szyslak both found her attractive that Moe made anonymous phone calls to her and Homer once ogled Maude 's low - cut dress at a dinner party , which ended up with him and Marge Simpson going to marriage camp [ 1 ] .
Maude liked ficus plants , unflavored nonfat ice milk and Newsweek Magazine .
In one episode , when Marge was arrested for accidental shoplifting , Maude was one of the people who missed Marge ’s treats during a bake sale .
After her death , Marge was mildly surprised and concerned to discover Maude 's three pairs of shoes as she believes this to have been a fetish . [ 2 ]
Death
“ I know , they make you uncomfortable . ” ― Maude Flanders 's last words [ src ]
In 2000 , " Alone Again , Natura - Diddily " , Maude died after being knocked off a grandstand by several t- shirt cannons at the Springfield Speedway .
The shirts had been meant to hit Homer , who wanted one of them .
However , before the shirts could hit him , Homer noticed a bobby pin on the ground and bent over to pick it up .
This caused Maude , who was returning to her seat behind Homer , to be struck instead , and fall off the grandstand to her death , at least a 20 - foot drop .
According to Homer 's statement later in the episode , he had parked in the ambulance zone , which prevented any quick resuscitation . [ 3 ]
Her death crushed Ned and their sons , Todd and Rod , who , although used to some measure of hardship ( their house getting destroyed [ 4 ] ) assumed they would always be together ( The actual reason her character was killed off was due to a pay dispute between the actress who voiced her character and the show 's producers ) .
Apparently , Homer fell in her grave , which Ned mentioned [ 5 ] .
Reverend Lovejoy eulogized her as follows : " In many ways , Maude Flanders was a supporting player in our lives .
She did n't grab our attention with memorable catchphrases , or comical accents .
But , whether you noticed her or not , Maude was always there ... and we thought she always would be . " [ 6 ]
Though the episode aired in February 2000 , the events appeared to take place before the winter meaning that the events probably took place before Winter 1999 and 2000 .
After her death , the grieving Ned Flanders and the Simpsons saw in her sketchbook a series of drawings that outlined a plan for a Christian - themed amusement park named " Praiseland . "
Realizing this park to be her final dream , Ned acquired the defunct amusement park " Storytime Village " from Colonel Antoine " Tex " O'Hara ( " The Rich Texan " ) and , with the assistance of Homer and other townspeople , built and opened Praiseland .
He memorialized Maude there with a statue of her , and placed on its base a plaque bearing the phrase : " She taught us the joy of shame and the shame of joy . "
Praiseland sold Maude memorial items such as masks .
Praiseland gained popularity among the residents of Springfield when they erroneously attributed to the statue of Maude the performance of miracles providing religious experiences .
The religious experiences were actually hallucinations , caused by gas that was leaking from a gas line near the base of the statue ( it was revealed that Springfield natural gas was actually deadlier and more poisonous in area with good ventilation ) .
Feeling that profiting off the memory of his dead wife was wrong , and even more so after the candles near the gas leak nearly caused an explosion , Ned closed down Praiseland [ 7 ] .

Reversing a controversial deregulation decision made by the Bush administration , the FCC will seek to force broadband internet providers to adhere to some of the rules that have long applied to the nation 's landline phone providers .
The decision will be announced officially tomorrow by FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski , according to a senior FCC official 's statement Wednesday , and will likely set off a firestorm of protests from the nation 's well - connected telecommunications industry .
The FCC says the move is a response to a recent court ruling that called into question whether the FCC had authority to regulate how the nation 's broadband providers run their networks , including whether providers can block content .
The ruling came in a case where Comcast appealed an FCC order that forbade the carrier from blocking peer - to - peer file sharing .
The federal appeals court decision also called into question whether the FCC would have the legal authority to carry out much of its lauded National Broadband Plan .
Consumer groups have been calling for the FCC to reclassify broadband providers .
Broadband providers counter that regulation will stymie investment and make it less likely they will invest in new broadband infrastructure like fiber optic cables .
" The Chairman will seek to restore the status quo as it existed prior to the court decision in order to fulfill the previously stated agenda of extending broadband to all Americans , protecting consumers , ensuring fair competition , and preserving a free and open Internet , " the FCC official said .
The Bush administration 's FCC freed cable and DSL providers from having to rent their lines to competitors by reclassifying them as so - called Title I services , or information services .
That meant broadband providers escaped the heavier regulation of Title II that applies to " telecommunications services , " namely the nation 's phone lines .
Those rules include price controls and provisions that let users contact anyone they like using any device they care to plug in – whether that 's a modem or a Mickey Mouse phone .
The FCC says it will move to put broadband back under Title II , but only apply a few of the 48 or so regulations under that portion of law , using a process called " forbearance " to cancel out the rules it considers unnecessary .
" The Chairman will outline a ' third way ' approach between a weak Title I and a needlessly burdensome Title II approach , " the official said .
" It would 1 ) apply to broadband transmission service only the small handful of Title II provisions that , prior to the Comcast decision , were widely believed to be within the Commission 's purview , and 2 ) would have broad up - front forbearance and meaningful boundaries to guard against regulatory overreach . "
Here the official is likely referring to the so - called Four Freedoms , which are openness principles that the FCC issued in 2005 .
They essentially promise that broadband users can use the device they want , run the programs they want and access the services they want , so long as they do n't harm the network .
The commission never officially tried to enforce them until Comcast was caught secretly blocking peer - to - peer file sharing .
Then , an appeals court in D.C. found the FCC had no power to enforce them because the FCC had reclassified broadband as an " information service . "
Reclassification is often referred to as the " nuclear option , " because it undoes a decision that actually was contested all the way at the Supreme Court .
Even if the FCC describes its approach to reclassification as a moderate " third way , " expect a fierce battle from the nation 's telecom giants and from Republicans like Kay Bailey Hutchison , who last fall wanted to cut the FCC 's budget over a move to formally apply net neutrality rules to internet providers .
It 's not clear if the FCC will seek to apply the reclassification only to wireline broadband providers , or if it will also extend them to the wireless industry , as well .

More Young Women , 18 - 30 , Report Low Libido Women 30 and under report they are distressed with low libido .
April 21 , 2010  --
Iris , a young woman from North Carolina , can't understand why she has no sexual desire -- she is only 30 and in love .
" It distresses me because I will marry soon and I know this will create a lot of tension in my marriage , " Iris ( not her real name ) wrote to ABCNews.com .
Iris is one of an increasing number of women in the prime of life and at the height of their fertility who have lost their sexual desire , according to medical experts and a growing body of research .
Stress , depression and bad relationships can contribute to low libido , but often birth control pills or antidepressants are the culprit .
A 2010 study by the International Society for the Study of Women 's Sexual Health found many young women experienced guilt and distress over their sex lives .
A cross-sectional study of 31,000 U.S. females 18 and older published in 2008 in Obstetrics and Gynecology magazine , about 43 percent of women reported sexual problems .
Of those aged 18 to 44 , about 10 percent complained about low sexual desire -- or what is called hypoactive sexual desire disorder ( HSDD ) , according to the study , Prevalence of Female Sexual Problems Associated with Distress and Determinants of Treatment Seeking ( PRESIDE ) .
" It 's a real diagnosis , " said Dr. Carolyn Nemec , a women 's health specialist in the department of family medicine at the Cleveland Clinic .
" It 's very surprising and we are missing the boat if we do n't talk about younger women . "
" We always think of it as something that women go through at menopause , but millions of American women are affected , " she said .
" It 's a complex issue and women 's libidos are complex . "
In 2002 , the American Psychiatric Association categorized HSDD in its Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ( DSM ) as any persistent lack of sexual desire that causes a woman distress .
The disorder was most common in women aged 45 to 64 at 14.8 percent .
It 's not so much the lack of libido that characterizes the disorder , but the amount of anxiety it causes .
Even though post menopausal women report less sexual desire , only about 8 percent are diagnosed with HSDD , because they are not distressed , according to the PRESIDE study .
" I think a lot of women are distressed out there and feel bad and think something is wrong with them , " said Nemec .
" The younger patients hear so much about menopause and a lot of these women -- aged 18 to 30 -- do n't feel they have a voice .
We need to focus on them . "
Up to 40 percent of all women who have been diagnosed with HSDD also report depression , she said .
And for those who are on antidepressants like SSRIs , as many as half can experience a decrease in desire .
Birth Control , Antidepressants Can Cause Low Desire
Birth control pills that contain estrogen and progesterone can also be to blame .
" They increase sex - binding globulin , a protein in the blood stream that binds with our testosterone and testosterone is one of the central hormones in desire , " said Nemec .
When she rules out all other causes of low libido , Nemec will often recommend trying a different antidepressant or decreased dosages .
Sometimes , she 'll ask the woman to go on a " drug holiday , " to restart her libido .
For women , sexual desire is a complex psychological and physiological phenomenon .
Some of Nemec 's patients are young women who have just had a baby and trying to reignite desire after a pregnancy .
But others are single women in their 20s who began having sex just to keep up with their peers .
" I call it the ' going along syndrome , ' " she said .
" By 17 they are sexually active and go along with sex , even if it does n't feel good or they do n't have a libido .
If they go along at 18 or 20 , they continue after they are married . "
The danger is that if they do n't deal with the issues of desire until they are older , " the husband finally gets Viagra at 60 and she 's really in trouble . "
That may have been the case with Joan ( not her real name ) , a Texas woman who wrote to ABCNews.com .
" I have never had a libido , nor an orgasm , " said the 52 - year - old .
" I have looked for ways with creams and pills but to no avail . "
" I would love to find something to give me that feeling of wanting to have sex , " she said .
Sometimes loss of desire is exacerbated by other physical problems .
One of Nemec 's patients , a 25 - year - old newlywed , has a rare condition known as vulvar vestibulitis .
Jane , not her real name , has chronic vaginal pain -- a feeling of " burning and raw skin " -- and has n't been intimate with her husband in months .
" I went off birth control pills , tried dilators and physical therapy and every cream in the world , " she said .
" I even tried Botox , but it did n't help . "
" Every now and then I have the desire or urge , but then I just think about it being painful , " said Jane , an occupational therapist .
She 's lucky to have a supportive boyfriend , but it still takes its toll .
" In media everything is sex - based , and it's hard because you do n't feel sexy , " she said .
" I have had this for so long , I am trying to build my self esteem in other ways . "
For most women , low libido can be diagnosed with a five - question diagnostic tool , a questionnaire developed by the German - based pharmaceutical company Boehringer Ingelheim .
Some critics point to the pharmaceutical companies for creating new diagnoses like HSDD for the sake of drug sales .
Just last November , Boehringer Ingelheim 's new drug flibanserin was hailed as the new female Viagra .
A random , double - blind international study showed the drug appeared to increase sexual desire by enhancing mood .
The new drug works on neurotransmittors , not on blood flow , as does Viagra .
The PRESIDE study was also funded by Boehringer .
Study author Dr. Jan Shifren told ABCNews.com last year that women who have no sexual desire should not be " medicalized , " but for those who were bothered by their lack of desire , " this group of women deserves effective treatment . "
" If an effective and safe medication is identified , it should be available to women , but given potential risks and side effects , drug therapy always should be considered a last resort , " said Shifren , who is director of the Menopause Program in the Massachusetts General Hospital Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology .
" Women in good relationships who are physically and psychologically healthy are generally satisfied with their sex lives -- and you 'll never find this in a medicine cabinet , " she said .
Too Much Pressure on Women to Be Sexy
But Judith Steinhart , a health and sexuality consultant certified by the American Association of Sexuality Educators , Counselors and Therapists , said today 's young women -- and men -- feel the pressure to be " sex pots . "
Steinhart argues that the medical and pharmaceutical community is dictating new norms : " Whose definition of sexual desire are we talking about ? " asked the New York City sex educator .
" Is it lack of sexual desire or do we have expectations that we are supposed to be hypersexualized women at 16 , 26 , 36 and so on ? " asked Steinhart .
" Take a look at any MTV video or at Beyonce , " she said .
" Who can even move that way ?
She works so hard on the dance floor , I 'll bet she goes to sleep early , too . "
Men have a built - in " biofeedback mechanism " for desire , according to Steinhart .
" When they are aroused they can see their erection and it reinforces their arousal .
Women do n't have the parallel opportunity . "
" [ Young women ] are so tired from working so hard that they think sex is supposed to be a release and a relief and often it is n't , " she said .
" A lot of women say the best part of traveling is the hotel room with the giant bed and the clean sheets and no children crying and a husband who wants something from them , " said Steinhart .
" Truthfully , women have always been this way . "
But Jenn Berman , whose radio show , " Cosmo's Love and Sex Doctor " airs on Sirius XM , said the new economy is taking a toll on the sex drive of young women .
" One reason is stress , " said the Los Angeles therapist .
" It 's a libido killer . "
" Right now , people are losing jobs and working longer hours , " said Berman .
" They are doing two or three people 's jobs and taking pay decreases .
They are exhausted . "
Women are often the primary breadwinner or are under pressure to make up for the family 's financial shortages .
" From what I am seeing young women are feeling older than their age , " said Berman .
" They have diminished sex libido and are too tired to care . "
Just because a woman has low sex drive now , does n't mean it 's permanent .
" Most people do n't realize that their sex lives ebb and flow throughout a lifetime , " said Berman .
" It can be low this week and the next month the couple is having sex five times a week .
All is not lost . "
" Couples who just gave birth are unlikely to be going at it , " she said .
" But when the kids have left for college and there 's an empty nest , there is a revival of the sex drive . "

Here are ploys that some car dealers — even the most scrupulous — may try to run on you when it comes time to buy :
1 . The credit cozen : A dealer may say something like , “ With your credit score , you wo n’t qualify for competitive financing rates . ”
This may be true .
However , some dealers will imply your credit is worse than it is so you think you ’ll have to pay a higher interest rate .
That ’s why it ’s important to know your credit score before you head to the showroom .
2 . The single - transaction strategy : Many people view buying a car as one transaction .
It ’s not , and dealers know this .
It ’s really three transactions rolled into one — the new - car price , the trade - in value and the financing .
The dealer sees all three as ways to make money .
Treat each as a separate transaction , and negotiate each one .
If you get a new car for $ 200 over invoice but receive only $ 1,000 for a trade - in car that ’s worth $ 2,500 , you have n’t done as well as you could .
3 . The payment ploy : A dealer might say , “ We can get you into this car for only $ 389 a month . ”
Probably true , but how ?
In some cases , the dealer may have factored in a large down payment or stretched the term of the auto loan to 60 or 72 months .
Focus on the price of the car rather than the monthly payment .
Never answer the question , “ How much can you pay each month ? ”
Stick to saying , “ I can afford to pay X dollars for the car . ”
4 . The sticker shenanigan :
The vehicle price listed on the window is what ’s known as the manufacturer ’s suggested retail price , or MSRP .
Who cares ?
You want to know the invoice price — the amount the dealer paid for it .
Working from the invoice up is much easier than trying to cut from the MSRP .
You should also find out what cars actually are selling for after taking into account any consumer and dealer incentives .
Of course , some really hot cars go for sticker price and even above .
Be patient and wait :
The prices will fall as demand slackens .
And three years later , you ’ll be selling or trading a car for the same money as the early buyers who may have paid thousands more initially .
5 . The holdback hustle : Manufacturers often give cash incentives — sometimes called holdbacks — to their dealers to encourage them to move slow - selling models .
This typically is n’t mentioned in advertisements .
You ’ll want to search for holdbacks or other factory - to - dealer incentives available for the car you ’re considering .
While it ’s not a given that the dealer will apply any of these funds to the car you like , it does n’t hurt to ask .
6 . The financing four - flush : Some dealers have been known to call customers days or even weeks after they signed a purchase agreement to tell them that the financing fell through .
It ’s a crock .
The dealer can know if you qualify for financing almost instantly .
The goal of the later call ?
To sign you up for a loan with a higher interest rate because , according to them , they just found out you did n’t qualify for the lower rate .
Never leave the showroom without signed contracts that spell out every detail and with every blank filled in .
If you ’ve got that , they ca n’t retreat on the financing .
7 . The insurance illusion : Some dealers may try hard to get you to purchase an insurance policy when you ’re buying your car .
One type , gap insurance , covers the difference between what the car is worth and the amount you still owe on it .
Say the car is worth $ 10,000 but you still owe $ 12,000 .
If your car is a total loss , a gap insurance policy will cover that $ 2,000 difference .
But do n’t automatically agree to it .
Some insurers include the benefits of gap insurance in their regular comprehensive automobile coverage , so check there first .
Also , gap insurance is generally quite inexpensive when purchased from your regular car insurance company rather than a dealer .
Another favorite , credit life insurance , will pay the balance of your loan if you die before you ’ve been able to repay it .
These policies may or may not make sense for you , but in most cases you should decline all such offers .
If these policies interest you , you ’ll want to understand what you ’re purchasing and have the opportunity to decline it and shop around for better prices .
The mark - up on these policies at the dealership can be enormous , in part because the insurance companies that sell the policies to the dealerships offer them huge incentives — everything from cash to first - class trips — to push the policies .
8 . The rate razzle - dazzle :
It certainly sounds tempting — zero percent interest to finance a new car .
However , this deal may not be the best one for your pocketbook .
For starters , most financing incentives are for shorter terms , and you need a stellar credit record .
With very short - term loans , such as 24 or 36 months , payments on even a moderately priced car can be sky - high .
In addition , you may be better off finding your own financing and then taking the dealer rebate , if one is offered .
Say you ’re looking at a $ 20,000 car and will get $ 4,000 for your trade - in .
You can choose between zero percent financing or financing at 3.49 percent with a $ 2,000 rebate .
The term of the loan is 36 months .
Over the course of the loan , you ’ll come out ahead by more than $ 1,200 if you take the rebate and the 3.49 percent financing .
Use our calculator to compute the actual dollars over the term of the loan to figure out what deal suits you best .
9 . The rollover ruse : Often , it ’s tempting to trade up to a more expensive car even before you ’ve finished paying off the car you ’re currently driving .
One way that some car buyers do this is by rolling over the remaining payments on their current car into a new car loan or lease .
While this is n’t illegal , it is risky .
Why ?
You ’ll end up owing more on the second car than it ’s worth .
In the parlance of the automobile world , you ’ll be “ upside down ” on the vehicle .
If it ’s totaled in an accident or if you decide down the road to trade it in , you ’ll end up writing out a big check to cover the remaining amount of the loan .
Rule of thumb :
Do n’t roll over an old car loan into a new one .
10 .
The long - term trick :
There ’s nothing illegal or even deceptive about dealers offering loan periods extending out six or seven years .
After all , many cars last longer than they used to , and longer loan terms mean your monthly payments are lower .
Still , it ’s not optimal .
You ’re likely to continually owe more on your car than it ’s worth because your car is depreciating faster than you ’re paying it off .
If you ’re considering a long loan period , you probably should scale back to a less expensive car better suited to your budget .
11 . The balloon bamboozle : Similarly , some dealers will encourage you to purchase a car for unrealistically low monthly payments now but with a much larger balloon payment at the end of the loan period .
In a few cases , this can be a legitimate way to finance a car .
For instance , you may have just graduated and can realistically assume that your income will rise by the time the balloon payment comes due .
But be wary .
That big payment could hit you when you ’re least able to pay it .

What do you get a 100 year old woman for her birthday ?
Any sane person would say “ an XBox 360 ” , yet these people apparently got Granny ( or great great granny ? ) a brand new iPad .
And Guess what ?
She LOVES it .
Almost as much as her relatives enjoy drinking and watching her use it .
( And yes , we ’ve already reached out to see if she ’ll be our next Mac Chick of the Month ) .
Well , here ’s ONE iPad that will be on eBay in a couple months ( oh come one , you were thinking it too ) .

As readers may recall , we had argued over a series of posts that the proposed Volcker rule , to bar proprietary trading at commercial banks , did not go far enough in reducing systemic risk .
While the concept was so sketchy that it was difficult to be certain what it meant , it appeared to have two serious flaws .
First , it defined proprietary trading as only positions booked that did not involve customer transactions , such as private equity funds .
This is a spurious distinction .
Separate proprietary trading operations are a relatively recent development , and plenty of speculation occurs on market - making desks .
Gillian
Tett pointed out that the so - called “ trading books ” were regularly abused in the run-up to the crisis ( for instance , the large CDO positions , which were tantamount to proprietary positions , were held on customer dealing desks ) .
Thus even with the Volcker rule , bad practices that played a direct role in the meltdown would continue to be backstopped .
The second flaw is that Volcker appeares to have an outdated view of the financial system .
He viewed backstops as limited to banks , meaning depositaries .
Yet in the crisis , emergency lifelines were throws to a host of non-banks : AIG , Goldman , Morgan Stanley , plus Bear and Merrill ( via subsidized mergers ) .
Bloomberg contended that Goldman and Morgan Stanley could continue to be bank holding companies , but would have to give up their banking subsidiaries , which would have a very limited impact on their business ( for instance , a source who understood the operations of one major Wall Street firm estimated the rule would affect less than 1 % of their activities ) .
Reader MichaelC disagreed , arguing that Goldman booked its credit default swaps on the books of its bank subsidiary , so it would be troublesome and costly for them to escape ; I checked with other sources , and they said it was too early to tell what the rule might really look like to tell .
All these debates appear to be moot .
The Volcker rule is following the tried and true path of all Obama “ reforms ” , meaning an idea announced with great fanfare is being whittled back to meaninglessness .
The media are differing a bit on the particulars of how the neutering operation came to pass , but the general direction appears clear .
The New York Post appears first out with the story ( before reader howl , the Post has broken some financial stories and the discerning FT Alphaville picked up on this one , hat tip Richard Smith ) :
“ My understanding is the White House really does believe in it , but Treasury and the Hill do not , so it ’s not going very far , ” said one person close to the Treasury Department .
Added another source , “ the White House is looking to save face ” by backing a proposal with fewer restrictions .
“ The administration will spin the compromise as a way to add safety to proprietary trading , ” a source said .
“ But this is a fundamentally different approach to regulation [ than the Volcker rule ] …
Yves here .
This is an intriguing reading of the dynamics .
On the one hand , Timothy Geithner is so embattled that not only is he being interviewed in Vogue , but he takes a surprisingly defensive stance .
Yet the Treasury engage in a turf war with the White House and wins .
Or perhaps the climbdown is more a function of Congressional opposition ( this change would require new legislation ) .
The Senate Banking Committee made it abundantly clear it was not happy to see Team Obama retrading its financial reform bill at such a late juncture .
Bloomberg is running a story tonight that ironically shows some of the tensions between the White House and Treasury views , and offers some support for the Post ’s reading .
Notice these paragraphs :
One month after President Barack Obama said firms “ will no longer be allowed ” to trade for their own accounts , officials say they need flexibility to avoid impairing the $ 7.2 trillion Treasury securities market .
Dealers who trade in government bonds on behalf of clients need to be able to maintain inventories in their firms ’ own accounts to insure market liquidity , said Lee Sachs , a counselor to Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner .
“ This measure is not aimed at anything having to do with customer business , market - making or hedging , ” Sachs , a former senior managing director in charge of debt capital markets at Bears Stearns & Co. , said in an interview .
Yves here .
Spoken like a true industry mouthpiece .
As noted earlier , Sachs is trying to persuade the know - nothing chump public that anything that happens on a market - making desk is hunky - dory .
I would bet that post mortems of Lehman would reveal that very little of the risk - taking that pushed them to the brink had anything to do with proprietary trading as defined by Sachs .
Similarly , the banking industry defenders are arguing that it would be hard to distinguish between customer and proprietary trading .
That of course is meant to suggest that even that the Volcker rule construct , with its limited impact , should not go forward .
But this notion again is misleading .
The old joke of dealers is that a position is a trade that did not work out .
Firms has simple - minded rules from the days of partnerships ( when the owners were aggressive in watching risk - taking because they were personally liable for losses ) to deal with this “ whoops , I have a position I did n’t want ” problem , as well as the other risk , of traders taking big bets that might bear watching .
For instance , Ace Greenberg , who operated as Bear Stearns ’ de facto chief risk officer , made traders dump any underwater position that was three weeks old .
It ’s worth noting that Bear came to ruin after Greenberg was excluded from a day to day supervisory role .
Yet while Treasury appears to be , um , clairfying the Volcker rule , the White House maintains its steadfast support :
Asked if the Obama administration is softening its insistence on the Volcker rule , White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs yesterday said , “ absolutely not . ”
“ We ’re not walking away from , and we ’re not watering down that proposal one bit , ” Gibbs said .
Yves here .
But in reality ….
In negotiations with Congress , administration officials have focused on giving regulators the power to set limits and to design the program in a way that avoids market disruptions .
Yves again .
Sure looks like the usual Obama double speak to me .

Astronomer Snaevarr Gudmundsson from Iceland was able to travel to within just a few kilometers from the Eyjafjallajokull volcano , and shared his incredible close - up images with Universe Today .
“ I stayed near the volcano from about 16:00 hours to 22:00 hours on Saturday and watched its impressive eruption , ” Gudmundsson said in an email to me .
“ Amazing event , awesome explosions of 1200 °C hot magma reaching ice and water .
I shot more than 550 images during these hours of continuous enjoyment .
Sounds ridiculous but its ever changing appearance was never boring . ”
The massive plume put on an impressive display – from lightning forming within the plume to an incredible amount of spewing ash .
On one of following pictures you can see helicopter for size comparison of the plume
Gudmundsson said he and other photographers were a safe distance from the eruption , but were a few kilometers away .
“ Nearby was a small river and its prominent sound prevented us from hearing much in the eruption itself except a loud roar from thunders from time to time , ” he said .
“ During daylight we even glimpsed some lightning but at dusk ( the photo is taken at about 22:00 in the evening ) they were easily spotted especially during active periods of explosions . ”
I asked if there was any smell associated with the Iceland volcano and Gudmundsson said there was a bit of sulphuric smell in the air even though they were in a location where the wind was blowing towards the volcano .
“ The ash went to the other side of the volcano , as you can suggest , making life miserable for farmers and households below , but the rest of it climbed to higher altitude and from there to Europe . ”
“ From the foot of the volcano to the prominent top , seen in front of the tephra cloud ( seen on some of the photos ) the overall height is about 1300 - 1400 m , ” Gudmundsson said .
“ When the eruption began a huge flood went down beneath the obvious glacier to the left from the crater .
And if you look closely on the photo showing the foot hills under the mountain a lot of icebergs can be seen on the flood plain .
Under that same glacier was a rather deep lagoon ( ca n’t been seen but sat between the two high moraines on either side of it , in front of the glacier ) but sediment from the eruption filled it up in only two days at most !
That is unbelievable .
I have climbed this glacier many times but to approach it one usually must traverse the moraine , around the lagoon to reach the ice .
But suddenly it is gone . ”
Gudmundsson said the flood paths can be seen below the glacier as a narrow gorges carved into rather soft volcanic sediment .
Some of the latest reports from Iceland say that in some areas the volcanic fallout has been significant , clogging car engines , turning grass grey and reducing visibility to just a few meters .
The police say driving conditions can be very difficult in these places , but the area affected is remote with only a few hundred people , most of them living in isolated homes and many of them farmers .
They have been advised to stay inside with the windows and doors shut and if they do venture out to wear goggles and a mask .
The staff of Landhelgisgæslan ( Icelandic Coastal Patrol ) captured this radar image of the craters in Eyjafjallajökull on Friday .
There are three main openings and each one is 200 - 500 m in diameter .
Our very special thanks to Snaevarr Gudmundsson for sharing his images and experiences of seeing the volcano “ up close and personal . ”
Also thanks to Col Maybury of radio station 2NUR in Newcastle , Australia for connecting me with Snaevarr ( yes my connection to Iceland came through Australia ! ) and also thanks to erlinger on Twitter for help with Icelandic translations of news reports .

Dr. Margaret Hamburg , the commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration , has said one of her priorities is to improve the information on food package labels .
Her new crackdown on dishonest nutritional claims by food manufacturers is a welcome sign that she means business .
Earlier this month , the agency made public 17 letters it had sent to food companies , accusing them of inflating nutritional claims or masking undesirable ingredients .
Several products , including Gorton ’s Fish Fillets and Dreyer ’s bite - size Dibs ice cream snacks , were cited for labels boasting that they contained no trans fat , even though they had high levels of saturated fat .
POM pomegranate juice was cited for misleading claims on the company ’s Web site , which is listed on juice bottles , that said the juice could prevent or cure disease like hypertension , diabetes and cancer .
This was not the first time Dr. Hamburg took on misleading claims .
Last fall , she helped persuade the food industry to drop its Smart Choices program , which put a “ better for you ” symbol on products of dubious nutritional value , like Kellogg ’s Froot Loops .
The effort to rein in unauthorized health and nutrient claims is a refreshing departure from the laissez - faire approach under former President George W. Bush .
It is part of a larger initiative that also has the F.D.A. exploring revisions of the Nutrition Facts panel on the backs and sides of packages  to emphasize calorie content in realistic portion sizes , for example , as the nation confronts a serious obesity problem .
A divorce deal that shames women
Philippa Vaughan persuaded the judge to award her the extra lump sum of £ 215,000
The High Court 's award of a £ 215,000 divorce payout to the former wife of a leading barrister - 25 years after the couple split - is a terrible blow to those who rightly believe that women are equal to men .
Philippa Vaughan , 66 , has no children , lives in a four - bedroom £ 1 million house in fashionable Hammersmith , West London , and inherited £ 770,000 from her parents .
But she still convinced the judge to award her the extra lump sum .
He said it was ' plainly wrong ' to think she could adjust to life after her exhusband 's maintenance payments were cancelled last year .
In this case , the absurdity of Mrs Vaughan 's divorce claim is exposed by the fact that as a working woman ( with a job as an expert in Islamic and Indian art ) , she was able to earn her own living .
By any yardstick this was an unjust claim .
Particularly since her exhusband had accrued most of his wealth < cite > after </ cite > they split and during his second marriage .
It seems Mrs Vaughan 's main concern was to get one over her ex - rather than any interest in justice .
So once again our crazy divorce laws , which too often encourage women to sponge off men , have delivered another hammer blow against the institution of marriage .
Any divorce lawyer will tell you that such high - profile court awards have a profound effect on women 's attitudes to marriage and divorce - especially with regard to the values of young women .
Is it any wonder that surveys suggest that 20 per cent of girls do n't want a career , but , like footballers '
WAGs , simply want to hitch on to a rich man ?
It 's also not surprising if young men are reluctant to get married .
They fear that if they divorce , they could face financial ruin .
As a result , marriage rates are at the lowest since records began in 1862 .
Britain 's divorce laws need to be changed to recognise how much women 's roles in society have altered - mainly for the better - and to stop grasping ladies of leisure , or wives who earn good salaries , from leeching off men .

We do n't need a Queen of cupcakes
She got the nickname ' Waity Katie ' because of her spectacular ability to do nothing but wait for her Prince to come .
But now Kate Middleton ought to be called ' Weighty Katie ' .
For Prince William 's workshy , holiday - loving girlfriend threatens to become a heavy millstone around the Royal Family 's neck .
She 's hardly what palace modernisers had in mind for a future Queen .
Where 's the proper job ?
Where 's the devotion to hard work and charity that are so embedded in the life of today 's favourite royals ?
Instead , all we see from Kate is a stubborn protection of her privacy ( successfully suing photographers for taking pictures of her playing tennis ) and her efforts to promote her parents ' children 's party website with a series of simpering childhood memories , including the occasion when she forgot to put self - raising flour into a cake - mix .
The last thing Britain needs is a lazy , talentless Queen of Cupcakes .

Heather Mills : ' My problems is I 'm too nice '
A penny for your thoughts , Paul ?
An employment tribunal has to decide whether Heather Mills , left , is telling the truth in a very messy case in which her former nanny claims she was forced to resign when she had her own child .
In one corner is the ex-nanny who says : ' Heather Mills was rude and horrible . '
Facing her is Mucca , the woman who became a champion gold - digger when she got £ 24 million after a brief marriage to Paul McCartney .
Attacking her former nanny , she complained : ' She 's just after money .

ORANGE ALERT , IT'S PHONEY BLAIR
Tony Blair is described by Labour spin doctors as the party 's ' secret election weapon ' .
What an apt phrase .
For everything about the former Prime Minister these days seems to be secret : his consultancy fees from oil companies with interests in Iraq ; the true role of his close aide Ruth Turner ; why one of his companies is licensed in the low - tax regimes of Lithuania and Liechtenstein ; and - most importantly - why is he so orange !
His new Tax Exile Tan has led to rumours he 's planning to launch his own brand of sun lotion - a bit like Paul Newman 's cooking sauces .
It would rival St Tropez , the world 's most famous fake tan .
St Tony - the world 's finest fake .
Perfect product placement if ever we 've seen it .

The former Archbishop of Canterbury and other senior figures in the Church of England have complained there is a bias against Christians in Britain and claim that other faiths are treated more sensitively .
In reply , the current head of the Church , Dr Rowan Williams , disagreed , arguing that Christians in poorer parts of the world were suffering much more .
But since when was the state of a nation 's spiritual health measured by its GDP ?
Surely the real problem suffered by Christians in Britain is a pathetic lack of leadership from that bearded ' old druid ' Rowan himself .

Biodiesel made from beef byproducts fuels rail operator 's first green train , cutting carbon emissions and improving air quality .
From BusinessGreen , part of the Guardian Environment Network
US rail operator Amtrak may have given the term " cattle car " a whole new meaning with the first test of a biodiesel train that runs on beef byproducts .
Operating on a $ 274,000 ( £ 178,000 ) grant from the Federal Railroad Administration , the state - owned rail company has begun operating its daily Heartland Flyer train , travelling between Oklahoma City and Forth Worth , using B20 biodiesel fuel .
The fuel , which mixes 80 per cent diesel with 20 per cent biofuel , cuts both hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions by 10 per cent , according to the company , which said that the fuel also reduces particulates by 15 per cent and sulphates by 20 per cent compared to standard diesel fuels .
The biodiesel , which was refined from beef byproducts provided by a Texas supplier , will run as a 12 - month experiment , during which Amtrak will collect data on emissions , and on the impact of the fuel on mechanical parts .
Although technically the fuel mix can run in unmodified trains , the locomotive was fitted with new engine assemblies so that detailed measurements could be taken to establish the effect of the fuel on the engine .
The impact of biofuel blends on engines can vary dramatically , with some biofuels leading to increased wear and tear , while others tend to burn cleaner and lead to improved engine performance and durability .
Amtrak is now promoting the biodiesel train to passengers with a 50 per cent discount on a companion fare until 28 May .
The biodiesel trial is the latest in a series of environmental initiatives from Amtrak designed to highlight the operator 's position as a green alternative to domestic US flights .
The company has switched from low - sulphur fuel to ultra - low sulphur fuel across the railroad to tackle air pollution , and has installed recycling receptacles in its trains and stations .
It has also stepped up efforts to reduc e idling times for its diesel trains , and has introduced regenerative braking systems similar to those in hybrid cars such as the Toyota Prius for its electric trains .
In addition , the company is a member of the Chicago Climate Exchange and has a public commitment to reduce emissions by seven per cent in 2011 and 2012 .

Japan ’s debt - to - GDP ratio is around 170 % – much higher than in Greece , where the figure stands at around 110 % .
But , despite the grim parallel , Japan ’s government does not seem to think that it needs to take the problem seriously .
Tyson Nash , a former pro hockey player and current radio analyst for the Phoenix Coyotes , believes in doing things the right way .
He moved from Canada to the United States 15 years ago , when he was 20 , in order to fulfill his dream of a sports career .
He was not the biggest or the most talented hockey player , but he managed through grit and determination to play professionally into his 30s , including a stint with the Coyotes .
' This country has given me what I have , " he told me .
" I am very grateful to be here . "
In 2001 , Nash began the process to become a permanent resident of the U.S. , to get what is commonly called a " green card . "
During his time in this country , he has paid over a million and a half dollars in taxes .
He has worked steadily and never been in trouble .
He received the Coyotes ' Man of the Year Award in 2004 for his involvement in the community .
He has paid lawyers over $ 16,000 to help him go through the immigration process the " right way . "
" I 've tried to be a model citizen , " he said .
" Both me and my wife ( who is also Canadian ) .
I 've tried always to do what is right and to follow the rules .
And for all that what have I gotten ?
Nothing .
Frustration .
Disappointment .
It 's sad , really .
You hear people talk about immigrants doing things the ' right way ' all the time .
I suspect that they have no idea what that entails . "
The road to permanent residency involves a lot of paperwork , a lot of waiting , a lot of wondering , and an interview .
Nash did n't get notice of his green card interview until 2008 .
" It was a really long time to wait , " he said .
" You know how it goes in hockey ?
A career does n't last forever .
It 's usually pretty short . "
By the time Nash got an interview for his green card , his professional playing days were coming to an end .
In fact , the interview was scheduled for the very day that he was to have a last - ditch tryout with the Tampa Bay Lightning .
" I called my lawyer and tried to get it changed , " he said .
" We wrote letters .
We did n't hear back .
In the meantime , the Coyotes called and said we have this opportunity here for you with an analyst 's job .
I was still interested in playing , but I canceled my tryout .
The green card is the most important thing in my life .
I told Phoenix if I can't get my tryout back , then I 'll take the job . "
The story gets more complicated after that , at least in the way that dealing with a bureaucracy and its red tape can make anything and everything more complicated .
What it boils down to is that in his original application , back in 2001 , Nash listed his occupation as a hockey player .
By the time he got to his green card interview all these years later , his occupation was TV analyst .
As a result , his conversation with the immigration official who was considering his application became , in Nash 's word , surreal .
" Essentially , he told me that I filed my application as a hockey player and not a broadcaster so I had to get back in line and refile , " Nash said .

As Nash waits to find out if he 'll be deported ( along with his wife and three American children ) , he ran into a man from South Africa at a kids ' baseball game .
" He told me , ' You would n't believe it , I won a green card in a lottery , ' " Nash said .

Each year the U.S. government issues 50,000 green cards through a lottery , with applicants selected randomly by a computer .

Over at Hoopyrides , Mister Jalopy took Steve Jobs ' anti-Flash statement and replaced " Adobe " with " Apple " and " Flash " with " closed . "
The results are funny .
Before :
Adobe 's Flash products are 100 % proprietary .
They are only available from Adobe , and Adobe has sole authority as to their future enhancement , pricing , etc .
While Adobe 's Flash products are widely available , this does not mean they are open , since they are controlled entirely by Adobe and available only from Adobe .
By almost any definition , Flash is a closed system .

Visit Active Volcanoes in AmericaWhile not necessarily advisable to mess with the Earth ’s wrath and fling yourself into deadly conditions , we can walk the razor ’s edge between life and death if we exercise caution .
After all , you only live once and for many of us , near - death thrills make us feel , well , alive .
Whether we paraglide in Patagonia , bungee in Bora Bora , surf with sharks or heliski the Alps , we love to court disaster .
So while a real vacation for some people is a week of total rest and relaxation , for others a leave of absence from the corporate world or 9 - to - 5 occurs with a leave from rational logic and common sense .
To these intrepid travelers , we dedicate this look at some incredible , high - voltage volcanoes in America .
Cleveland Volcano
Anchorage and Fairbanks , Alaska are remote enough for many but by way of contrast , the state ’s Aleutian Islands seem otherworldly .
The archipelago acts like a bridge between Asia and the Americas and was probably the passage ancient tribes took to cross the continents .
The Aleutian chain consists of more than three - hundred volcanic islands and represents the north periphery of the Pacific Ring of Fire .
To quote Johnny Cash , “ it burns , burns , burns ” on a regular basis up here .
The Cleveland Volcano is one of the most spectacular mountains not just in the Aleutians , but anywhere in the Americas .
The ultra prominent peak is a stratovolcano in the middle of the archipelago , on Chuginadak Island .
Mount Cleveland forms one entire half of the island and as recently as late 2009 , sent ash plumes 20,000 feet high into the atmosphere .
To visit the Aleutian Islands , visitors can either book a small charter or ferry passage on the Alaska Marine Highway .
Mount St. Helens
May 18 , 1980 .
A day that now lives in infamy in Washington state and indeed , much of America .
Less than a month after a magnitude 4.2 earthquake , Mount St. Helens burst spectacularly over a swath of land the size of Andorra and Lichtenstein .
The subsequent debris avalanche and near - apocalyptic landscape damage was without precedent .
Ash fell in Idaho within hours and as far away as Edmonton , Alberta .
The death toll was fifty - seven , with countless homes and property a total write - off .
Mount St. Helens is still active .
Visitors can however , hike to the summit via Monitor Ridge trail .
The volcano sits within Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument , a 110,000 acres area around the mountain , within Gifford Pinchot National Forest .
The drive from Seattle is approximately 3.5 hours but a mere 1.5 hours from Portland , Oregon .
Mount Washington
The Pacific Ring of Fire Cascade Range , of which Mount St. Helens and Mount Rainier outside Seattle both belong , contains some gorgeous peaks in Oregon .
Mount Washington ( the name is indeed ironic ) last sent magma into the sky well over a millennium ago , in the late 7th century .
The shield volcano is the main feature of the awesome Mount Washington Wilderness area , which offers 52,516 acres of forests , mountains and lakes for visitors to explore .
Mount Bachelor
Dramatic Mount Bachelor and the Mount Bachelor Volcanic Chain is one of the premier attractions in Oregon .
With a summit of over 9,000 feet , the mountain is formidable and was last active 10,000 years ago .
A stratovolcano on top of a shield volcano , Bachelor is part of the Cascade Range and Three Sisters Wilderness area .
The mountain is also a first - rate ski resort with a notable vertical drop in excess of 3,300 feet .
The Mount Bachelor ski area in fact , is sixth in size in the United States and behind only Vail , Colorado in summit height .
Nearby Bend , Oregon , a fine city of close to 100,000 people , is a short drive from Mount Bachelor .
OIL does not just provide the fuel that powers the internal - combustion engines in cars .
Its by - products are also the basis of many of the materials , such as plastics , from which cars are made .
One of these petroleum by - products is isoprene .
This is used to make the synthetic rubber in car tyres .
About a billion tyres are made every year — each one requiring about 26 litres ( or seven American gallons ) of oil .
Now a way has been found to make greener tyres by using genetically modified bugs to produce isoprene biologically .
The work is being carried out by Genencor , an industrial biotech company based in California , in collaboration with Goodyear , one of the world 's biggest tyremakers .
In the laboratory Genencor has produced enough of what it calls BioIsoprene for Goodyear to build and successfully test prototype tyres made with the new material .
Genencor is now completing a dedicated pilot factory which will be used to develop a mass - production process , which could be operating commercially around 2015 .
Isoprene is a monomer , which is a substance whose molecules can be linked together chemically to form a polymer .
Latex , a material obtained from rubber trees , is a natural polymer of isoprene .
Isoprene can also be artificially polymerised to make synthetic rubber .
Tyres are made of a combination of natural and synthetic rubber to provide the grip and endurance required by carmakers .
Typically around a quarter of each tyre is made from isoprene derived from petrochemicals , and about 60 % of worldwide isoprene production is used by tyremakers .
The rest goes into making other products , including glues , disposable nappies and surgical gloves .
Genencor used a genetically modified form of E - coli , a favourite species of bacteria in microbial genetics , to produce BioIsoprene .
By splicing in genes from other bugs , the company was able to engineer synthetic metabolic pathways — ones that do not exist in nature — that enable the bacteria to produce isoprene from the sugars found in plant materials such as sugar cane , corn cobs and switchgrass , a tall - growing variety native to North America .
The modified organism ferments sugars in the biomass to produce isoprene , in such a way that it bubbles out as a gas .
This makes it easier to collect and purify compared with separating it out from a liquid .
Isoprene needs to be extremely pure to make synthetic rubber .
Having the flexibility to use different crops and agricultural by - products as the feedstock for the process is important , says Karl Sanford of Genencor .
The company wanted to avoid the contentious issue of using crops that might otherwise provide food .
Moreover , supply chains for biomass are still being developed , so the availability of feedstock will change .
Research is continuing into using other micro-organisms , such as yeast , which might be engineered to create similar metabolic pathways .
If biologically derived isoprene becomes more widely available , Mr Sanford thinks , industry could find additional uses for it .
And if production costs end up being as low as the company hopes , isoprene might itself become a feedstock from which to produce synthetic fuels , such as petrol or diesel .
So as well as helping build cars in a more environmentally friendly way , it might eventually help power them in a greener way , too .

Many people alive today possess some Neanderthal ancestry , according to a landmark scientific study .
The finding has surprised many experts , as previous genetic evidence suggested the Neanderthals made little or no contribution to our inheritance .
The result comes from analysis of the Neanderthal genome - the " instruction manual " describing how these ancient humans were put together .
Between 1 % and 4 % of the Eurasian human genome seems to come from Neanderthals .
But the study confirms living humans overwhelmingly trace their ancestry to a small population of Africans who later spread out across the world .
[ Neanderthals ] are not totally extinct , in some of us they live on - a little bit
Professor Svante Paabo
Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology
The most widely - accepted theory of modern human origins - known as Out of Africa - holds that the ancestors of living humans ( Homo sapiens ) originated in Africa some 200,000 years ago .
A relatively small group of people then left the continent to populate the rest of the world between 50,000 and 60,000 years ago .
While the Neanderthal genetic contribution - found in people from Europe , Asia and Oceania - appears to be small , this figure is higher than previous genetic analyses have suggested .
" They are not totally extinct .
In some of us they live on , a little bit , " said Professor Svante Paabo , from the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig , Germany .
Professor Chris Stringer , research leader in human origins at London 's Natural History Museum , is one of the architects of the Out of Africa theory .
He told BBC News : " In some ways [ the study ] confirms what we already knew , in that the Neanderthals look like a separate line .
" But , of course , the really surprising thing for many of us is the implication that there has been some interbreeding between Neanderthals and modern humans in the past . "

Advertisement John Hawks , assistant professor of anthropology at the University of Wisconsin - Madison in the US , told BBC News : " They 're us .
We 're them .
" It seemed like it was likely to be possible , but I am surprised by the amount .
I really was not expecting it to be as high as 4 % , " he said of the genetic contribution from Neanderthals .
The sequencing of the Neanderthal genome is a landmark scientific achievement , the product of a four - year - long effort led from Germany 's Max Planck Institute but involving many other universities around the world .
The project makes use of efficient " high - throughput " technology which allows many genetic sequences to be processed at the same time .
The draft Neanderthal sequence contains DNA extracted from the bones of three different Neanderthals found at Vindija Cave in Croatia .
Retrieving good quality genetic material from remains tens of thousands of years old presented many hurdles which had to be overcome .
The samples almost always contained only a small amount of Neanderthal DNA amid vast quantities of DNA from bacteria and fungi that colonised the remains after death .
Svante Paabo ( pictured here with a Neanderthal skull ) led the research effort
The Neanderthal DNA itself had broken down into very short segments and had changed chemically .
Luckily , the chemical changes were of a predictable nature , allowing the researchers to write software that corrected for them .
Writing in Science journal , the researchers describe how they compared this draft sequence with the genomes of modern people from around the globe .
" The comparison of these two genetic sequences enables us to find out where our genome differs from that of our closest relative , " said Professor Paabo .
Those things that made the Neanderthals apparent to us as a population - those things did n't work
Dr John Hawks
University of Wisconsin- Madison
The results show that the genomes of non-Africans ( from Europe , China and New Guinea ) are closer to the Neanderthal sequence than are those from Africa .
The most likely explanation , say the researchers , is that there was limited mating , or " gene flow " , between Neanderthals and the ancestors of present - day Eurasians .
This must have taken place just as people were leaving Africa , while they were still part of one pioneering population .
This mixing could have taken place either in North Africa , the Levant or the Arabian Peninsula , say the researchers .
Professor Stringer added : " Any functional significance of these shared genes remains to be determined , but that will certainly be a focus for the next stages of this fascinating research . "
The Out of Africa theory contends that modern humans replaced local " archaic " populations like the Neanderthals .
But there are several variations on this idea .
The most conservative model proposes that this replacement took place with no interbreeding between modern humans and Neanderthals .
Unique features
Another version allows for a degree of assimilation , or absorption , of other human types into the Homo sapiens gene pool .
The latest research strongly supports the Out of Africa theory , but it falsifies the most conservative version of events .
The team identified more than 70 gene changes that were unique to modern humans .
These genes are implicated in physiology , the development of the brain , skin and bone .
The researchers also looked for signs of " selective sweeps " - strong natural selection acting to boost traits in modern humans .
They found 212 regions where positive selection may have been taking place .
The scientists are interested in discovering genes that distinguish modern humans from Neanderthals because they may have given our evolutionary line certain advantages over the course of evolution .
The most obvious differences were in physique : the muscular , stocky frames of Neanderthals contrast sharply with those of our ancestors .
But it is likely there were also more subtle differences , in behaviour , for example .
Dr Hawks commented that the amount of Neanderthal DNA in our genomes seemed high : " What it means is that any traits [ Neanderthals ] had that might have been useful in later populations should still be here .
" So when we see that their anatomies are gone , this is n't just chance .
Those things that made the Neanderthals apparent to us as a population - those things did n't work .
They 're gone because they did n't work in the context of our population . "
Researchers had previously thought Europe was the region where Neanderthals and modern humans were most likely to have exchanged genes .
The two human types overlapped here for some 10,000 years .
The authors of the paper in Science do not rule out some interbreeding in Europe , but say it was not possible to detect this with present scientific methods .

Flights out of Irish airports may have resumed after being cancelled earlier today but aviation chiefs have warned of further travel problems in the coming days .
Flights to and from the country were postponed up to 1 pm this afternoon because of an ash cloud drifting over the country from Iceland .
Over - flights of Ireland from the UK and Europe were unaffected by the flight ban because ash concentrations do not affect the airspace above 20,000 feet .
Air space over Scotland , Northern Ireland is to close from 7 am tomorrow morning due to ash , it was confirmed tonight .
The Irish Aviation Authority is due to release a statement at about midnight .
The IAA last night decided to impose a " no - fly zone " over Ireland from 7 am under advice from the Volcanic Ash Advice Centre in London that there was a risk of " ash ingestion " to aircraft engines .
The decision was based on the safety risks to crews and passengers and followed a change in the weather resulting in the ash cloud being pushed south over the country by northerly winds .
Ireland and Scotland are the only countries affected .
However , the authority this morning said it had cleared Irish airports to open for " full operations " from 1 pm .
The UK’s Civil Aviation Authority ( CAA ) said airspace over Northern Ireland could also reopen at 1 pm , allowing flights to resume from Belfast City , Belfast International and City of Derry airports .
The majority of flight arrivals at Irish airports did not resume until late this afternoon , with most arrivals at Dublin airport cancelled up to 3.45 pm .
All flight arrivals at Cork Airport , with the exception of Aer Arann flight RE295P from Dublin , were cancelled up to 3.55 pm .
A spokeswoman for Ryanair said it was operating a number of extra flights between Dublin and Stansted , Faro , Seville and Fuerteventura during the afternoon to repatriate stranded passengers .
The airline also said that gaps in capacity would help to accommodate passengers further .
The relief experienced by airline passengers could prove short - lived , with forecasters predicting more ash from the Icelandic volcano will blow down over the country later this week .
In a statement this morning , the authority said its decision to close airports earlier today was based solely on the safety risks to crews and passengers as a result of the drift south of the volcanic ash cloud caused by the north easterly winds .
" The situation will be reviewed as the week goes on .
Winds are forecast to continue coming from a Northerly direction for the next few days and this could lead to further problems , " it said .
Speaking to The Irish Times , Met Éireann forecaster Evelyn Cusack warned that airflow would remain northwesterly for the rest of today , tonight and tomorrow , increasing the risk of further ash disruption .
However , she said the risk of ash disruption would be lowered from Thursday onwards due to a shift in winds , with airflow changing to a northeasterly direction .
Elsewhere , Irish Airport Authority ( IAA ) chief executive Eamon Brennan forecast months of uncertainty as a result of the volcanic ash cloud .
“ We ’re not out of the woods yet , ” he told RTÉ radio .
“ There ’s no doubt about it , we ’re probably facing a summer of uncertainly due
to this ash cloud , " he added .
Meanwhile , Minister for Transport , Noel Dempsey , who was also affected by the travel problems said today , a strong European response is needed to deal with the continuing disruption to flights as a result of ash cloud from the Eyjafjalljökull volcano .
Welcoming the outcome of a meeting of EU Transport Ministers this morning , Mr Dempsey said an action plan was necessary to deal with the situation as it continues to evolve .
Mr Dempsey , who was unable to travel to the meeting due to the closure of Irish airspace , said : " Safety is at the heart of Europe 's response and it was appropriate that a significant part of the discussion this morning focussed on the development of appropriate risk assessment methodologies to deal with potential future threats " .
Today 's flight cancellations were due to the first closure of Irish airspace since restrictions were lifted on April 20th following six days of suspension .
That closure led tothe cancellation of 100,000 flights internationally , and disruption to about 10 million passengers .
The crisis is estimated to have cost the air transport industry up to € 2.5 billion .
The Dublin Airport Authority estimated it lost € 7 - 8 million as a result of the cancellation of 3,200 flights , affecting 400,000 passengers , during the previous shutdown .
The IAA this afternoon said it will continue to monitor the movement of volcanic ash , and would issue a further update at 0900 hours on tomorrow .

Apple wants the fastest chip for its mobile devices and has bought another chip maker to gain an edge over its competitors .
Apple has acquired a small Austin , Tex. , company called Intrinsity , known for making zippy versions of a computer chip often found in mobile devices .
The deal , which closed late last month and was confirmed by Apple on Tuesday , shows the company continuing to try to gain an edge in the mobile device market by purchasing technology and chip experts .
It is the second time in two years that Apple has purchased a small chip company to gain critical technology for making a faster processor that uses less energy .
“ This adds another arrow to their quiver , ” said Tom R. Halfhill , a well - known chip analyst for Microprocessor Report .
Mr. Halfhill said his industry contacts put Apple ’s acquisition price for Intrinsity at $ 121 million .
Steve Dowling , an Apple spokesman , declined to comment on that figure .
Believe it or not , California law requires health experts to find a cure for homosexuality .
No joke : Welfare and Institutions Code Section 8050 .
We can delete this code .
We will .
But first , we should know how it got there .
This 60 - year - old relic was not some gay - baiting prelude to the McCarthy era .
It came , rather , in response to public outcry over sex crimes in California , specifically the molestation - murder of a 6 - year - old Los Angeles girl .
The murderer was not a gay man .
There was no connection between the crime and homosexuality at all .
Even so , before the dust had settled , well - meaning California legislators passed a law that not only required health officials to seek “ the causes and cures of homosexuality ” but likened people who are gay to child molesters .
Amazingly , it ’s still on the books .
You might call it “ Linda ’s Law . ”
Advertisement
Linda Joyce Glucoft went out to play after dinner on Nov. 14 , 1949 , and never came home .
She was raped and murdered by the grandfather of one of her playmates , a repeat sex offender who offered no resistance when arrested in a downtown bar .
He admitted to the gruesome slaying , to wrapping her body in a colorful blanket and hiding it near an incinerator .
He told police he was acting on an indescribable compulsion and that he had n’t made her suffer long .
He was the personification of what was then called a sexual psychopath .
The rape and murder struck a nerve .
There had been nine such slayings in Los Angeles in the 2 1/2 decades before Linda ’s murder .
But in the following week , police fielded 25 reports of molestation .
Public outcry grew .
It took just days to gather 10,000 signatures on a petition demanding action from Sacramento .
Sacramento was ready to oblige .
Even before the killer had been sentenced to death , Gov. Earl Warren called a special session of the Legislature to deal with the issue of sexual predators .
Experts flocked to the state capital with explanations and solutions .
Judge A.A. Scott , presiding judge of the Juvenile Court in Los Angeles , complained that the state lacked tools to address the problem .
“ The weakness , ” he said , “ lies in the Department of Mental Hygiene .
There is no program under which to treat these sexual psychopaths . ”

Scott would soon get his program .
Aside from beefed - up enforcement policies , lawmakers sought an academic approach .
They would order the state ’s mental hospitals and its universities to solve the problem .
It was at this step , as the Legislature defined the role of science in solving the “ sexual psychopath ” problem , that gay people -- simply because they vexed the psychiatric profession -- were swept up in the net .
In 1950 , homosexuality remained , officially , a mental disorder .
So when the Legislature promised funding for a study into the causes and cures of sexual deviance , it was , tragically , natural to add homosexuality to the list .
So , in April of that year , almost exactly 60 years ago , one of the bills Warren signed to combat the scourge of child molestation included a command that the “ Department of Mental Hygiene plan , conduct and cause to be conducted scientific research into the causes and cures of sexual deviation , including deviations conducive to sex crimes against children , and the causes and cures of homosexuality , and methods of identifying potential sex offenders . ”

You do n’t need a law degree to see that homosexuality was shoe - horned into a sentence otherwise focused on the task at hand .
Over the decades , a huge volume of sex - offender law has replaced this old statute .
But the call for a cure to homosexuality , and the suggestion that it is somehow linked to child molestation and murder , has survived many rounds of revision .
As recently as 1977 , the code was moved rather than deleted , and the language tweaked to add a “ shall ” here and a “ to ” there .
It lives now as Section 8050 of the Welfare and Institutions Code .
That code is like the old race restrictions on property deeds .
The fact that it came more from ignorance than hate might excuse its enactment , but it does n’t relieve us of the duty of blotting it out .
Assembly Bill 2199 , which faces its first hearing Tuesday before the Public Safety Committee , would undo 60 years of libel and give California a set of law books that reflects science and values that were sadly absent in 1950 .

In a session yesterday at Forrester 's Marketing Forum , Forrester analysts Josh Bernoff and Augie Ray presented research findings on peer influence and word of mouth marketing .
Some of the statistics were surprising , and the presentation was rife with practical tips for marketers we thought worth sharing .
Influencers are Diverse
Ray said that when marketers think about targeting influencers , they tend to think of them " like a stew " : tasty , but undefined .
He advises thinking about them instead as a " delicious 3 - course meal " in which it 's important to savor the flavors of each .
He outlined a Peer Influence Pyramid that breaks down influencers into three types : Social Broadcasters ( at the top ) , Mass Influencers ( middle ) , and Potential Influencers ( bottom of the pyramid ) .
Social Broadcasters are few in number but great in scale — they are the top bloggers , most well - connected individuals , and have a lot of followers looking to them for news and advice on the latest and greatest .
They have scale but lack trust , in the sense that their followers will click on the links and recommendations they share but still perform their own evaluation of the data — this makes Social Broadcasters better suited for awareness than preference .
At the bottom of the pyramid are the Potential Influencers — this is where the trust really is .
These are the proverbial " average consumer " who have primarily networks of people they actually know in an offline context ( friends , family , peers ) .
These networks are rich with trust , and make up 84 % of the total population of the pyramid .
In the middle are the Mass Influencers , who make up only 16 % of the pyramid but account for 80 % of the influence impressions about products and services .
Ray says of this group , " you ca n't ignore the minority that creates the majority of the influence . "
You also need different strategies to reach the different types of influencers .
Tips for Reaching the 3 Types of Influencers
Social Broadcasters tend to hate traditional PR and press releases , so according to Ray the secret to dealing with them is to build relationships .
This group does n't want to hear from you only when you need something , and they want to be respected for their audience .
Develop customized offers for them that they can't refuse , that reflect your understanding of their uniqueness and their point of view .
In doing so you may cross over into the rules of endorsements , so be sure to be very familiar with the FTC guidelines regarding this .
To reach Potential Influencers , you need to make things drop - dead easy .
This group is not as motivated nor is it as technically savvy as the people higher on the pyramid .
Tell your marketing teams to come up with ideas that are so drop - dead great and so relevant to your defined audience that they can't help but spread .
You also want to keep people engaged over time by reaching out and addressing them between major campaigns .
Reaching Mass Influencers in the middle involves giving them something to talk about .
Understand their characteristics and give them more content they can't resist sharing .
This part of the pyramid includes the people their friends and family turn to frequently before making important purchases , so do n't forget their significant offline influence and tailor your campaigns accordingly .
Influence Impression Data : 500 Billion Per Year
Bernoff presented a number of research findings around influence impressions , defining two key buckets where people are sharing information about products and services online :
Influence impressions : these happen on social media and networking sites : Twitter , Facebook , MySpace , LinkedIn , and others .
The people who make them know generally who they 're connecting with and who will read them ( people they know ) .
Influence posts : these are more permanent data points in blog posts , ratings and reviews sites , and in discussion forums .
These tend to be less directed , in that when putting a post online it 's not usually known how many or who will be reading it .
In the first category , the research study found 256 billion influence impressions occurring per year .
Influence posts were numbered at 1.64 billion per year , which accounted for generating another 250 billion impressions .
In other words , people are making 500 billion influence impressions on one another about products and services every year .
The research also looked at where those influence impressions are happening .
The following graph captures the results of where people are sharing influence online in both of the above categories :
Bernoff and Ray shared a case study of analyzing the three types of influencers in the consumer electronics sector and how to approach them , and stressed that it 's possible ( and indeed , necessary ) for marketers to be doing this type of analysis in any industry , any product category , and for any age or demographic .
In summary , Bernoff and Ray 's advice to marketers includes :
Build a strategy for reaching all three types of influencers .
Allocate your budget in light of a potential 500 billion impressions of peer influence .
Analyze and reach out to your mass influencers specifically for maximum reach .

I love working in the shell .
Mastery of shell lets you get things done in seconds , rather than minutes or hours , if you chose to write a program instead .
In this article I 'd like to explain the top one - liners from the commandlinefu.com .
It 's a user - driven website where people get to choose the best and most useful shell one - liners .
But before I do that , I want to take the opportunity and link to a few of my articles that I wrote some time ago on working efficiently in the command line :
And now the explanation of top one - liners from commandlinefu .
# 1 . Run the last command as root
$ sudo !!
We all know what the sudo command does - it runs the command as another user , in this case , it runs the command as superuser because no other user was specified .
But what 's really interesting is the bang - bang !!
part of the command .
It 's called the event designator .
An event designator references a command in shell 's history .
In this case the event designator references the previous command .
Writing !!
is the same as writing !- 1 .
The - 1 refers to the last command .
You can generalize it , and write !-n to refer to the n-th previous command .
To view all your previous commands , type history .
This one - liner is actually really bash - specific , as event designators are a feature of bash .
I wrote about event designators in much more detail in my article " The Definitive Guide to Bash Command Line History . "
The article also comes with a printable cheat sheet for working with the history .
# 2 . Serve the current directory at http://localhost:8000/
$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer
This one - liner starts a web server on port 8000 with the contents of current directory on all the interfaces ( address 0.0.0.0 ) , not just localhost .
If you have " index.html " or " index.htm " files , it will serve those , otherwise it will list the contents of the currently working directory .
It works because python comes with a standard module called SimpleHTTPServer .
The -m argument makes python to search for a module named SimpleHTTPServer.py in all the possible system locations ( listed in sys.path and $ PYTHONPATH shell variable ) .
Once found , it executes it as a script .
If you look at the source code of this module , you 'll find that this module tests if it 's run as a script if name == ' main ' , and if it is , it runs the test ( ) method that makes it run a web server in the current directory .
To use a different port , specify it as the next argument :
$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
This command runs a HTTP server on all local interfaces on port 8080 .
# 3 . Save a file you edited in vim without the needed permissions
:w ! sudo tee %
This happens to me way too often .
I open a system config file in vim and edit it just to find out that I do n't have permissions to save it .
This one - liner saves the day .
Instead of writing the while to a temporary file :w / tmp / foobar and then moving the temporary file to the right destination mv / tmp / foobar /etc/ service.conf , you now just type the one - liner above in vim and it will save the file .
Here is how it works , if you look at the vim documentation ( by typing : he :w in vim ) , you 'll find the reference to the command :w ! {cmd} that says that vim runs {cmd} and passes it the contents of the file as standard input .
In this one - liner the {cmd} part is the sudo tee % command .
It runs tee % as superuser .
But wait , what is % ?
Well , it 's a read - only register in vim that contains the filename of the current file !
Therefore the command that vim executes becomes tee current_filename , with the current directory being whatever the current_file is in .
Now what does tee do ?
The tee command takes standard input and write it to a file !
Rephrasing , it takes the contents of the file edited in vim , and writes it to the file ( while being root ) !
All done !
# 4 . Change to the previous working directory
$ cd -
Everyone knows this , right ?
The dash " - " is short for " previous working directory . "
The previous working directory is defined by $ OLDPWD shell variable .
After you use the cd command , it sets the $ OLDPWD environment variable , and then , if you type the short version cd - , it effectively becomes cd $ OLDPWD and changes to the previous directory .
To change to a directory named " - " , you have to either cd to the parent directory and then do cd ./- or do cd / full / path /to /- .
# 5 . Run the previous shell command but replace string " foo " with " bar "
$ ^foo^bar ^
This is another event designator .
This one is for quick substitution .
It replaces foo with bar and repeats the last command .
It 's actually a shortcut for !!:s/foo/bar/ .
This one - liner applies the s modifier to the !!
event designator .
As we learned from one - liner # 1 , the !!
event designator stands for the previous command .
Now the s modifier stands for substitute ( greetings to sed ) and it substitutes the first word with the second word .
Note that this one - liner replaces just the first word in the previous command .
To replace all words , add the g modifer ( g for global ) :
$ !!:gs/foo/bar
This one - liner is also bash - specific , as event designators are a feature of bash .
Again , see my article " The Definitive Guide to Bash Command Line History . "
I explain all this stuff in great detail .
# 6 . Quickly backup or copy a file
$ cp filename{ , .bak}
This one - liner copies the file named filename to a file named filename .
bak .
Here is how it works .
It uses brace expansion to construct a list of arguments for the cp command .
Brace expansion is a mechanism by which arbitrary strings may be generated .
In this one - liner filename{ , . bak} gets brace expanded to filename filename .bak and puts in place of the brace expression .
The command becomes cp filename filename .bak and file gets copied .
Talking more about brace expansion , you can do all kinds of combinatorics with it .
Here is a fun application :
$ echo {a , b, c}{a , b, c}{a , b,c}
It generates all the possible strings 3 - letter from the set {a , b , c} :
aaa aab aac aba abb abc aca acb acc baa bab bac bba bbb bbc bca bcb bcc caa cab cac cba cbb cbc cca ccb ccc
And here is how to generate all the possible 2 - letter strings from the set of {a , b , c} :
$ echo {a , b, c}{a , b,c}
It produces :
aa ab ac ba bb bc ca cb cc
If you liked this , you may also like my article where I defined a bunch of set operations ( such as intersection , union , symmetry , powerset , etc ) by using just shell commands .
The article is called " Set Operations in the Unix Shell . "
( And since I have sets in the shell , I will soon write articles on on " Combinatorics in the Shell " and " Algebra in the Shell " .
Fun topics to explore .
Perhaps even " Topology in the Shell " :) )
# 7. mtr - traceroute and ping combined
$ mtr google.com
MTR , bettern known as " Matt 's Traceroute " combines both traceroute and ping command .
After each successful hop , it sends a ping request to the found machine , this way it produces output of both traceroute and ping to better understand the quality of link .
If it finds out a packet took an alternative route , it displays it , and by default it keeps updating the statistics so you knew what was going on in real time .
# 8 . Find the last command that begins with " whatever , " but avoid running it
$ ! whatever :
p
Another use of event designators .
The ! whatever designator searches the shell history for the most recently executed command that starts with whatever .
But instead of executing it , it prints it .
The :p modifier makes it print instead of executing .
This one - liner is bash - specific , as event designators are a feature of bash .
Once again , see my article " The Definitive Guide to Bash Command Line History . "
I explain all this stuff in great detail .
# 9 . Copy your public - key to remote - machine for public - key authentication
$ ssh - copy - id remote - machine
This one - liner copies your public - key , that you generated with ssh - keygen ( either SSHv1 file identity . pub or SSHv2 file id_rsa.pub ) to the remote - machine and places it in ~/.ssh / authorized_keys file .
This ensures that the next time you try to log into that machine , public - key authentication ( commonly referred to as " passwordless authentication . " ) will be used instead of the regular password authentication .
If you wanted to do it yourself , you 'd have to take the following steps :
your - machine $ scp ~/.ssh/identity .pub remote - machine : your - machine $ ssh remote - machine remote - machine $ cat identity.pub >>
~/.ssh/authorized_keys
This one - liner saves a great deal of typing .
Actually I just found out that there was a shorter way to do it :
your - machine $ ssh remote - machine ' cat >> .ssh/authorized_keys ' < .ssh/identity.pub
# 10 . Capture video of a linux desktop
$ ffmpeg -f x11grab -s wxga -r 25 - i :0.0 - sameq /tmp/out.mpg
A pure coincidence , I have done so much video processing with ffmpeg that I know what most of this command does without looking much in the manual .
The ffmpeg generally can be descibed as a command that takes a bunch of options and the last option is the output file .
In this case the options are -f x11 grab -s wxga -r 25 - i :0.0 - sameq and the output file is /tmp/ out.mpg .
Here is what the options mean :
-f x11 grab makes ffmpeg to set the input video format as x11 grab .
The X11 framebuffer has a specific format it presents data in and it makes ffmpeg to decode it correctly .
makes ffmpeg to set the input video format as x11 grab .
The X11 framebuffer has a specific format it presents data in and it makes ffmpeg to decode it correctly .
-s wxga makes ffmpeg to set the size of the video to wxga which is shortcut for 1366x768 .
This is a strange resolution to use , I 'd just write -s 800x600 .
makes ffmpeg to set the size of the video to wxga which is shortcut for 1366x768 .
This is a strange resolution to use , I 'd just write .
-r 25 sets the framerate of the video to 25 fps .
sets the framerate of the video to 25 fps .
- i :0.0 sets the video input file to X11 display 0.0 at localhost .
sets the video input file to X11 display 0.0 at localhost .
- sameq preserves the quality of input stream .
It 's best to preserve the quality and post - process it later .
You can also specify ffmpeg to grab display from another x-server by changing the - i :0.0 to - i host :0.0 .
If you 're interested in ffmpeg , here are my other articles on ffmpeg that I wrote while ago :
Have fun !
This article was super fun to write and I hope you had fun , too .
I decided to write several more parts about CommandLineFu one - liners .
Tune in next time for the next 10 commandlinefu one - liners explained .
Popular conservative talk show host Glenn Beck made his predictions Saturday for the kind of judge President Obama will nominate to replace Supreme Court Justice Stevens , who announced Friday that he will retire .
Whoever the president chooses , Beck said on his radio show , Americans can be sure it will be someone hand - picked to stymie opposition through political correctness .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ It will allow the Democrats to say they just hate women , they just hate Hispanics , they just hate a black , they just hate whatever .
That ’s what it will be , ” Beck said .
“ I mean if he ’s smart , he will find a gay , handicapped black woman who ’s an immigrant .
She could be the devil .
She could say ‘ I hate America .
I want to destroy America , ’ and that way they ’ll only be able to say ‘ Why do you hate gay immigrant black handicapped women ? ' ”
Stevens ’ announcement of retirement means Obama must choose a second Supreme Court justice within his first two years in office .
His last selection , Justice Sonia Sotomayor , ignited a prolonged battle with Republicans .
This time , Obama must get a nominee confirmed in the middle of an election season and with possibly even more opposition .
Beck was quick to claim Obama would appoint another “ radical ” like Justice Sotomayor .
“ It will cause all kind of problems in Washington , it will split the parties , ” Beck said .
The comments mirror a statement by conservative icon Rush Limbaugh when the retirement of Justice David Souter paved the way for Obama ’s first Supreme Court pick in May of last year .
After playing a clip of Obama telling leaders of Planned Parenthood that the court needed a justice with “ empathy ” for single mothers , Limbaugh translated what he believed Obama was saying .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ So here ’s what we need .
We need a teenage single mother who ’s gay , is a lesbian , who ’s dirt poor , African - American and disabled , ” Limbaugh said .
Obama has said that he will seek a nominee similar to Stevens and asked the Senate to move quickly after he chooses the replacement .
Regardless , Obama must choose to either “ be bold or play it safe ” , according to a New York Times article .
The story lists several likely candidates for the nomination .

As for Glenn Beck , he is unlikely to let up on his harsh criticism any time soon .
According to Forbes , he made $ 32 million in 2009 alone .
The web2 py scaffolding application “ welcome ” has a “ layout.html ” that {{include “ web2py_ajax.html ” }} within the < head > …</ head > tags .
“ web2 py_ajax.html ” defines a few useful JavaScript functions and includes all required CSS and JS files ( jquery.js , calendar.js , calendar.css ) .
The functions defined in “ web2 py_ajax.html ” are designed so that you do not need to write any JS in order to use them .
Web2 py comes with everything you need for the examples below to work , including jQuery .
Here are some examples :
Calendar and pre-validation
If you have :
< input class = " date " name= " fieldname " >
when you click on the input field it will automatically show a popup calendar .
Similarly class “ datetime ” shows a calendar with time - picker and “ time ” shows a time - picker .
If you have :
< input class = " double " name = " fieldname " >
web2 py will prevent you from typing anything that is not a floating point number .
Similarly class “ integer ” will prevent you from typing anything that is not a valid “ integer ” .
We call this “ pre-validation ” to avoid confusion with the proper server - side validation .
All forms generated by web2 py ( SQLFORM ) are CSS friendly all < input /> tags have classes that correspond to the type of the corresponding field , therefore they automatically provide the functionality described here .
Flash
If you have
< div class= " flash " > content</div >
and if content is not empty , it will slide down the content of the flash and will fade it out when you click on it .
Ajax
web2 py defines a function called “ ajax ” built on top of jQuery ’s own ajax .
Here is a example of usage :
< input name = " key " onKeyUp= " ajax ( ' callback ' , [ ' key ' ] , ' target ' ) ; " /> < div id =" target " ></div >
OnKeyUp the ajax function
ajax ( ' callback ' , [ ' key ' ] , ' target ' ) ;
calls the action at the url specified as first argument ( for example ‘ callback ’ ) and passes as post variables those specified in the second argument ( for example the value of < input name= ’ key ’ > ) , then stores the AJAX return value in the html tag with ID specified by the third argument ( for example ‘ target ’ ) .
If ‘ target ’ has a value attribute the AJAX return value goes into value instead of the inner HTML .
If ‘ target ’ is replaced by ‘ : eval ’ , the AJAX return value is interpreted as JS code and executed .
Components and Forms
When applications get more and more complex you may want to build more modular ones .
web2 py provides a mechanism to build very modular applications by embedding an action into the template of another action and capture form submissions from the inner one .
Here is an example .
Consider the following two actions in controller default .py
def index ( ) : return dict ( ) def myform ( ) : form = SQLFORM.factory ( Field ( ' name ' , requires=IS_NOT_EMPTY ( ) ) ) if form.accepts(request.vars ) : return ' Hello %s ' % form.vars.name return form
and the following template for the index ( ) action in default / index.html :
{{extend ' layout.html'}} < h1 > Page Title</h1 > {{=LOAD('myform ', ajax =True )}}
When calling the “ index ” action ( http://127.0.0.1:8000/myapp/default/index) the output of the index ( ) function is rendered by the template which , in turn , embeds the output of “ myform ” action ( http://127.0.0.1:8000/myapp/default/myaction) via ajax .
The LOAD function also generated all required JS code to handle forms inside the loaded content ( is the example there is a single form ) .
When the form is submitted , only the “ myform ” action is called and only the LOADed component is re-loaded , not the entire page .
If the form does not pass validation , the form is displayed again including validation errors ( this is all handled by the accept function ) .
If the form does pass validation , it returns “ Hello < your name > ” .
The text replaces the actual form , again without disturbing the outer HTML .
You can LOAD as many components as you like in one page .
The LAOD function also takes additional parameters including args= [ ] and vars={} to be passed to the called action .
The callback function can be any regular web2 py action and can have its own template ( for the LOADed component only ) .
Just make sure the template of a component does NOT {{extend ‘ layout .html ’}} since the layout is provided by the LOADing template .
The LOAD function can also load a URL hosted on a different server ( and it does not need to be running web2 py ) :
{{=LOAD(url='http://otherdomain/otherapp')}}
Sometimes it happens that your LOADed action needs to return more than HTML / TEXT but also instructions to the calling page , in the form of JS code embedded in the browser .
This can be done by storing JS code in an HTTP header returned by “ myform ” .
The following code for example makes the form “ fadein ” when it appears
def myform ( ) : form = SQLFORM.factory ( Field ( ' name ' , requires=IS_NOT_EMPTY( ) ) , _class='myformclass ' ) if form.accepts(request.vars ) : return ' Hello %s ' % form.vars.name response.headers [' web2py-component-command ']=' jQuery ( " .myformclass " ) .fadeIn ( ) ' return form
JSON
Sometimes you need JSON .
Any web2 py action can return json .
Just call the action with . json .
For example :
def myvalues ( ) : return dict ( values = [ 'a ' , 'b ' , 'c ' ] )
And call it with
http://127.0.0.1:8000/myapp/default/myvalues.json
( works also for .html and .xml out of the box .
For any other user - defined extension , you just need to create a views / generic.ext file to handle it ) .
Special care must be used when retuning DB Rows objects , since they are not serializable in JSON .
They must be serialized in Python first .
as_dict ( ) accomplished that .
For example :
def myusers ( ) : return dict ( users=db(db.auth_user.id>0).select () .as_dict ( ) )
And call it with
http://127.0.0.1:8000/myapp/default/myusers.json
If you want to program lower level web2 py includes simplejson in gluon.contrib.simplejson .
It has been modified to handle date and datetime .
Sarah Palin , showing no qualms about stepping into the thicket of state politics , rushed to the defense of South Carolina gubernatorial candidate Nikki Haley after a blogger claimed he had an " inappropriate physical relationship " with her .
The former Alaska governor had endorsed Haley , a Republican state representative and Tea Party favorite , and used her Facebook page Monday to defend the married mother of two children .
Palin slammed blogger Will Folks , who used to work as a communications consultant for Haley , for leveling the charge and then refusing to answer questions about it .
" Well , whaddya know ?
South Carolina 's conservative candidate , Nikki Haley , recently zipped to the front of the line in her state 's race for governor ; and lo and behold , now accusations of an affair surface , " Palin wrote .
" Nikki categorically denies the accusation that was spewed out there by a political blogger who has the gall to throw the stone , but then quickly duck and hide and proclaim he would not comment further on the issue .
Quite convenient . "
Palin said she warned Haley that " she would be targeted " and " she would be put through some hell " in her race .
" That , unfortunately , is the nature of the beast in politics today -- especially for conservative ' underdog ' candidates who surge in the polls and threaten to shake things up so government can be put back on the side of the people , " Palin wrote .
" South Carolina : do n't let some blogger make any accusation against your Nikki if the guy does n't even have the guts or the integrity to speak further on such a significant claim . "
Folks said in a blog that he went public about the purported affair with Haley because political adversaries were leaking proof of it to media outlets to impugn his reputation and destroy her .
" The truth in this case is what it is , " he wrote .
" Several years ago , prior to my marriage , I had an inappropriate physical relationship with Nikki . "
In an exclusive interview with The Associated Press prior to his blog post , Folks would not discuss details of the relationship .
Folks wrote Monday that he would not give any additional interviews , but later in the day told the AP that he was not working for any campaign .
Folks pleaded guilty to criminal domestic violence in 2005 and is now a political consultant .
Folks ' allegation comes nearly a year after Gov. Mark Sanford admitted to having an affair , and two weeks before the June 14 primary , a four - way contest that includes a congressman , the lieutenant governor and the state attorney general .
Haley , who has also been endorsed by former South Carolina first lady Jenny Sanford , said the attack was a distraction to the race .
" I have been 100 percent faithful to my husband throughout our 13 years of marriage .
This claim against me is categorically and totally false , " Haley , a 38 - year - old mother of two , said in a statement .
" It is quite simply South Carolina politics at its worst . "
In her Facebook posting , Palin urged Haley to " hang in there , " citing her experiences in the political limelight .
" I 've been there .
Any lies told about you will strengthen your resolve to clean up political and media corruption , " she wrote , describing a conversation she had with Haley Monday morning .
" Reaching her from Wasilla , I then joked with Nikki that I was calling her from one of the many locations the lamestream media claims I moved to .
( Let 's see , I think the last I heard I was living in the Hamptons , or was it Montana ?
No , supposedly L.A. is where they claim I moved when I ' left Todd ' in their idiotic reports . )
South Carolina friends , do n't let 'em just make things up . "
A former Sanford spokesman , Folks left the governor 's administration in 2005 , around the same time he pleaded guilty to the domestic violence charge and received a 30 - day suspended sentence .
Folks kicked open the door at a home he shared with a lobbyist and shoved her into a piece of furniture , police said .
Folks had little political experience before joining Sanford 's 2002 campaign .
When Sanford won , the governor made the ball - cap wearing , alternative rock band - playing son of a college professor his spokesman .
Haley , an accountant and three - term legislator , is in a tight race for the GOP nomination with Congressman Gresham Barrett , Lt. Gov. Andre Bauer and Attorney General Henry McMaster .
The Associated Press contributed to this report .
UPDATE : Today ’s X - 51 hypersonic missile test was scrubbed .
“ A tanker ship sailed into the splash zone , ” our spy says .
“ Next attempt tomorrow . ”
By the end of Tuesday , the Air Force could be a whole lot closer to a hypersonic cruise missile — a Mach 6 weapon that ’s 10 times faster than the old - school type .
After some technical issues forced a testing delay , the Air Force ’s X - 51 WaveRider will make its first flight attempt Tuesday .
And if all goes to plan , it will be the longest - ever hypersonic flight powered by scramjet propulsion — little more than air and plain ol ’ jet fuel .
The X - 51 flight is all part of an effort to develop a new class of cruise missile that can handle hypersonic flight , a concept that overlaps neatly with the Pentagon ’s interest in what it calls “ prompt global strike ” — the ability to reach out and blast a target over long distances , on extremely short notice .
But it ’s also technically challenging .
Sustained hypersonic flight is considered to be real stretch for an air - breathing vehicle — this excellent primer by Noah Shachtman explains why — but the WaveRider ’s unique shape employs the shockwaves created by hypersonic flight to create lift , as well as compress the air from the atmosphere to mix and burn with its fuel .
The test will be run from Edwards Air Force Base , California .
As this conceptual video shows , a B - 52 will carry the WaveRider aloft .
Once it reaches 50,000 feet , the B - 52 will release its payload .
The solid rocket booster will then kick in , taking the aircraft to about Mach 4.5 .
After the booster falls away , the scramjet is supposed to take the aircraft up to Mach 6 .
Other hypersonic test vehicles have gone faster .
The X - 43A hit Mach 9.7 .
But it used hydrogen , not simple hydrocarbons , for fuel .
And its engine burned away after 10 seconds .
The X - 51 could fly for as long as 5 minutes .
WaveRider is a collaboration between Boeing Phantom Works and engine maker Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne .
The project has been funded by the Air Force , NASA and Darpa , the Pentagon ’s far - out research arm .

At last we are waking up .
For the first time in modern history , the underlying assumption of political life - that those who exercise power over us will not be judged by the same legal and moral norms as common citizens - is beginning to crack .
International law is the belated reply to one of the oldest surviving aphorisms in the English language .
There are half a dozen versions , but the best known is this : '' They hang the man and flog the woman / That steals the goose from off the common /
But let the greater villain loose /
That steals the common from the goose . ''
The powerful were licensed by our expectations to carry on committing great crimes , while their subjects were punished for lesser offences .
No longer .
Picture the Pope awaiting trial in a British prison , and you begin to grasp the implications of the radical idea that has never yet been applied : equality before the law .
At the same time as Dawkins and Hitchens laid out their case , the barrister Polly Higgins challenged our perceptions of what legal equality meant .
Last Friday , she launched a campaign to have a fifth crime against peace recognised by the International Criminal Court .
The crime is ecocide : the destruction of the natural world .
The laws of most nations protect property fiercely , the individual capriciously , and society scarcely at all .
A single murder is prosecuted ; mass murder is the legitimate business of states .
Only when these acts are given names - genocide , crimes against humanity , war crimes , crimes of aggression - do we begin to understand their moral significance .
The same applies to nature .
The Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 criminalises anyone in Britain who '' intentionally picks '' a single flower from a protected plant .
But you can grub up as many as you like as long as it's '' an incidental result of a lawful operation ' ' .
Pick a buttonhole and you could find yourself in the dock .
Plough out the whole habitat and the law can't touch you .
Higgins gives some examples of ecocide : the tar sands mining in Alberta , the Pacific garbage patch , the pollution of the Niger delta by oil companies .
She points out that ecocide is rarely a crime of intent , but in most cases an incidental consequence of other policies .
Company directors or politicians could be prosecuted individually , but instead of being fined they would be charged for the restoration of the natural systems they 've damaged .
The purpose of criminalising ecocide is to raise the costs of trashing the planet to the point at which it ceases to be worthwhile .
This is the obvious outcome of a wider understanding of legal equality : why should private property be protected while the common wealth of humanity is not ?
International law as currently applied is often described as victors ' justice : the only people who get prosecuted are those who lose the wars they fight with powerful states .
It 's not even that .
About 50 suspected war criminals or human rights abusers are living in Britain .
Among them are alleged torturers who worked for Saddam Hussein 's government , one of Robert Mugabe 's henchmen , a member of Sudan 's Janjaweed militia and a gruesome collection of Afghan warlords .
But police have been given no budget to investigate them and the Crown Prosecution Service has no resources with which to pursue them .
So , while shoplifters are sent down , alleged mass murderers walk freely among us .
A month ago , after Tzipi Livni , the former Israeli foreign minister , cancelled her visit to Britain for fear of being arrested under a warrant obtained by human rights campaigners , Prime Minister Gordon Brown proposed stopping private prosecutions for crimes against humanity .
People like Livni , he said , represent '' countries and interests with which the UK must engage if we are not only to defend our national interest but maintain and extend an influence for good across the globe ' ' .
Britain , in other words , will not investigate or prosecute its allies .
Without private actions of the kind that Dawkins and Hitchens hope to launch , equality before the law remains an empty threat .
Brown 's desperate wriggling over the Livni case suggests that governments are beginning to grasp the shocking implications of what they have signed up to .
It 's time we did the same .
There 's a promise implicit in international law : the end of the age of exceptions .

That is not the case , though I understand how it may seem so .
After all , there is an undeniable allure in being contrarian .
But I am just " calling 'em as I sees 'em , " and it is the Status Quo which is the source of the outrageous insanity , not the person who points it out .
With great hesitation , today I voice a very unpopular point of view : that citizenship should mean something other than a free meal ticket or other give - away .
No , I do n't mean listening to fine speeches and bothering to vote every two years -- I mean citizenship where it hurts : paying taxes .
I am drawing upon key arguments made by James Madison in the Federalist Papers .
I know civics lessons are also politically incorrect -- though simulacra civics coursework is given lavish lip - service by the educational Elites and fiefdoms -- but please read this brief excerpt by Madison to get a flavor for the Tyranny of the Majority :
" A pure democracy can admit no cure for the mischiefs of faction .
A common passion or interest will be felt by a majority , and there is nothing to check the inducements to sacrifice the weaker party .
Hence it is , that democracies have ever been found incompatible with personal security or the rights of property ; and have , in general , been as short in their lives as they have been violent in their deaths . "
The Tyranny of the Majority is the primary topic of the Federalist Number 10 , in which Madison tackles the Achilles Heel of democracy : undesirable passions can very easily spread to a majority of the people , which can then enact its will through the democratic government without difficulty .
Put another way : the Power Elites of a democracy can buy the complicity of the majority by showering them with government giveaways and extracting no income tax from them .
For 60 % of the American public , the Federal government is a source of welfare / entitlements / giveaways .
Yes , workers pay a modest 7 % in Social Security taxes , but that is understood to be a " pay as you go " retirement system in which their modest contributions ( the 7 % ) pays their elders ' Social Security payments .
The Federal government -- the global Empire , the source of Medicare and Medicaid , the grantor of Section 8 housing vouchers , the funder of missions to Saturn , the entity which spends $ 3.5 trillion while collecting only $ 2 trillion , etc. -- gets essentially little funding from workers ' Social Security contributions .
Yes , surpluses go to the general fund , but those surpluses have dried up .
So 61 % of the populace is all in favor of more largesse and more taxes on the 19 % who pay most of the taxes .
The 60 % who pay little to nothing are delighted to receive " what 's owed to me " and the top 1 % which receives the vast bulk of corporate welfare and tax giveaways -- recall that the top 1 % own about 43 % of all the wealth of the nation -- are also delighted to shift the tax burden to the 19 % below them who earn most of the wages and thus end up paying most of the taxes .
Here are the numbers .
Nearly half of US households escape fed income tax Recession , new tax credits have nearly half of US households paying no federal income tax
This article outlines how a family of four ( with two children under 17 ) and an income of $ 50,000 ends up receiving a small tax credit ; they pay zero tax but get a small refund anyway .
This document from the Congressional Budget Office ( CBO ) displays the Effective Tax Rates ( CBO ) for American households .
After including earned - income tax credits , the bottom 60 % of households paid less than 1 % of all Federal income taxes , and the households between 60 % and 80 % paid 13 % .
The top 20 % paid 68.7 % of all Federal taxes : Income taxes , Social Security and Medicare , excise and corporate taxes .
The top 10 % of households paid fully 72.7 % of all Federal income tax , the top 5 % paid 60.7 % , and the top 1 % paid 38.8 % .
In essence , this is a vote - buying scheme by the Status Quo : the top 1 % control the policies of the State in alliance with the State 's own Elites , and together they buy the complicity of the bottom 60 % to passively accept their dominance .
This is the worst of all possible simulacra of democracy .
In the Wikipedia entry linked above , Mancur Olson is cited as arguing in The Logic of Collective Action that narrow and well organized minorities are more likely to assert their interests over those of the majority .
In other words , the top 1 % Financial Plutocracy asserts its interests over the 99 % and then buys the complicity of the bottom 60 % with largesse paid for by the top 19 % of earners .
In Who Rules America ? , Sociologist G. William
Dumhoff draws an important distinction between the net worth held by households in " marketable assets " such as homes and vehicles and " financial wealth . "
Homes and other tangible assets are , in Dumhoff 's words , " not as readily converted into cash and are more valuable to their owners for use purposes than they are for resale . "
Financial wealth such as stocks , bonds and other securities are liquid and therefore easily converted to cash ; these assets are what Dumhoff describes as " non-home wealth " on his website " Wealth , Income , and Power in America . "
As of 2007 , the bottom 80 % of American households held a mere 7 % of these financial assets , while the top 1 % held 42.7 % and the top 20 % held fully 93 % .
In a classic " divide and conquer " tactic , the State 's Power Elites have sold a slew of new taxes to fund the guaranteed - to - implode " healthcare reform " ( a.k.a. increased funding of sickcare cartels ) on those earning $ 250,000 or more .
Everyone earning 10 % - 20 % of that sum loudly applauds " sticking it to the rich " ( the Tyranny of the Majority in full flower ) while failing to note that the truly wealthy -- the ones who do n't have any earned income because they do n't work in salaried jobs , the ones who own roughly half the nation 's productive assets -- pay nothing but a slice of their unearned income -- much of which is protected by various tax breaks .
Complicity has consequences .
This entire strategy of operating the State as a fiefdom for the Financial Power Elites -- and by that I mean the people earning not $ 600,000 , but those earning $ 600 million or more each a year - - yes , they do exist -- and then buying the silence and complicity of the lower 60 % with enough largesse to keep them quiet or at least distracted , has costs which are simply being shunted forward .
Most importantly , citizenship has devolved to advocacy for a larger share of the Federal government 's swag .
The government " should " do more for me / us because it 's giving away so much swag to some other fiefdom / cartel .
Meanwhile , the slow poison of gargantuan deficits is eating away the soul of the nation .
The Federal government gets $ 900 billion in individual income taxes and borrows $ 1.56 trillion each year .
That is a rather stark number : the government borrows almost double what it collects in individual income taxes .
The " deal " is obvious : the costs of borrowing that $ 1.5 trillion are hidden from both the bottom 60 % who are recipients of government funds and also from the top 1 % , who believe that socializing risks and bailouts and privatizing profits is the ideal system of governance .
When interest rates rise and the payments on this exploding debt rise , then the " solution " will be " obvious " - - borrow more money from somebody , anybody , and pay whatever it takes so keep the corporate welfare , subsidies and tax breaks flowing , and also the giveaways to the bottom 60 % to buy their votes , silence , passivity and complicity in the fiscal destruction of the nation .
Madison feared the Tyranny of the Majority ; I fear we are already living it .

After announcing earlier that “ There is no Relapse 2 ” , Eminem has now tweeted “ RECOVERY http://www.eminem.com“.
On his website there is a press release stating Eminem ’s new album will not be called Relapse 2 but Recovery to be released on June 22nd .
Full Eminem Press Release
SANTA MONICA , CA – April 15 , 2010 – The much - anticipated new album from Eminem , Recovery ( Aftermath / Interscope ) , will be released June 22 , 2010 , it was announced today by Interscope Records .
On Recovery , his seventh major label studio album , Eminem has reached out to an exciting list of first - time collaborators , including DJ Khalil , Just Blaze , Jim Jonsin and Boi - 1da , among others .
Eminem releases
Recovery just over a year after his last album , 2009â€™s Relapse .
Relapse put the cap on an impressive ten years of recorded output , and contributed to Eminem being the biggest selling artist of 2000 - 2009 .
In recognition of this , Neilsen SoundScan named him their Artist of the Decade .
Relapse entered the charts at # 1 and , at nearly double platinum , was the best selling rap album of last year .
It also earned Eminem his 11th Grammy award , winning in the Best Rap Album category .
Relapseâ€™s first single , â€ œCrack A Bottleâ€ from Eminem , Dr. Dre and 50 Cent , soared to # 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 ( Eminemâ€™s second # 1 after 2002â€™s â€ œLose Yourselfâ€ ) and set a SoundScan record at the time of its release for opening week download sales ( 418,000 ) .
The album also spun off two other hits ; the Top 10 â€ œWe Made Youâ€ and Top 20 â€ œBeautiful.â€ 
“ I had originally planned for Relapse 2 to come out last year , ” remarked Eminem .
“ But as I kept recording and working with new producers , the idea of a sequel to Relapse started to make less and less sense to me , and I wanted to make a completely new album .
The music on Recovery came out very different from Relapse , and I think it deserves its own title . ”
Eminem has sold more than 78,000,000 albums worldwide .
After 1999â€ ™s quadruple platinum The Slim Shady LP , The Marshall Mathers LP ( 2000 ) and The Eminem Show ( 2002 ) became two of the Top 5 best selling albums of the 2000s , with approximately 10,000,000 copies of each sold in the U.S. alone .
2004â€™s Grammy - nominated Encore reached # 1 and was certified quadruple platinum .
The # 1 , double platinum , 2005 greatest hits collection Curtain Call : The Hits and # 2 , platinum , 2006 various artists compilation Eminem Presents : The Re - Up followed .
A trio of privacy groups want federal regulators to take a close look at ad networks that track web surfers ' and sell targeted ads .
The groups want the Federal Trade Commission to open an inquiry into whether these networks , including Google and Yahoo , are unfairly tracking Americans and profiting from their data .
The World Privacy Forum , the Center for Digital Democracy and U.S. PIRG ( public interest research groups ) argue that online marketers are secretly combining online data with offline data and using that to run real - time ad auctions .
" Consumers will be most shocked to learn that companies are instantaneously combining the details of their online lives with information from previously unconnected offline databases without their knowledge , let alone consent , " said U.S. PIRG Consumer Program Director Ed Mierzwinski .
" In just the last few years , a growing and barely regulated network of sellers and marketers has gained massive information advantages over consumers . "
Companies named in the complaint ( .pdf ) include Google , Yahoo , PubMatic , TARGUSinfo , MediaMath , eXelate , Rubicon Project , AppNexus and Rocket Fuel .
At issue is a growing market of targeted , real - time ads , where advertisers can choose to show ads to people based on their age , gender , income and location – as well as their recent online behavior – often on unrelated sites that let third parties track users ( for instance , Wired.com uses DoubleClick to serve ads and it tracks users across the web using cookies . )
Third - party cookie tracking is n't new – but as the complaint points out , marketers are increasingly trying to augment that data with other data sets – such as the social network data that Rapleaf harvests and re-sells .
Google has long held that its model of displaying ads based on the content of a web page or search term trumped the advantages of user tracking , but entered that market as well after it purchased the display ad giant , DoubleClick .
However , the company says its advertising cookies and tracking are separate from users ' account cookies , so its advertising database does not know your real name or Google login credentials .
Tying ad cookies to personally identifiable data would let marketers successfully combine online and offline data on website visitors to build a complete digital dossier on a user .
The groups want the FTC to investigate whether the companies are violating fair business laws .
They also demand that the companies get users ' permission to sell them at auction , pay them for the use of their data , and update their privacy policies to let users know that personally identifiable information is being used to sent them ads .
As for whether the FTC will investigate , it 's hard to say – but it 's not too likely .
The complaint does n't seem to allege any clear - cut violations of law .
The practices are murky , and the laws about privacy not much clearer .
The FTC does not confirm or deny ongoing investigations , announcing them only when a settlement or action has been finalized .
The online advertising industry has resisted new regulations , arguing that self - regulation works just fine .
However , in their draft of new self - regulatory rules , the industry banned only collecting financial account numbers and info about a user 's prescriptions , leaving all other health and financial information available for harvesting .
The FTC has shown some interest in online advertising in the last two years , holding hearings and issuing an advisory report ( .pdf ) in February 2009 .
But Center for Digital Democracy director Jeff Chester say its " inaction has encouraged the data - collection and ad- targeting industry to expand the use of consumer information for personalized advertising . "

Making Django and PyPy Play Nice ( Part 1 )
If you track Django ’s commits aggressivly ( ok so just me … ) , you may have noticed that there have been a number of commits to improve the compatibility of Django and PyPy in the last couple of days .
In the run up to Django 1.0 there were a ton of commits to make sure Django did n’t have too many assumptions that it was running on CPython , and that it could work with systems like Jython and PyPy .
Unfortunately , since then , our support has laxed a little , and a number of tests have begun to fail .
In the past couple of days I ’ve been working to correct this .
Here are some of the things that were wrong
The first issue I ran into was , in various tests , response .
context and response.
template being None , instead of the lists that were expected .
This was a pain to diagnose , but the ultimate source of the bug is that Django registers a signal handler in the test client that listens for templates being rendered .
However , it does n’t actually unregister that signal receiver .
Instead it relies on the fact that signals are stored as weakrefs , and when the function ends , the receivers that were registered ( which were local variables ) would be automatically deallocated .
On PyPy , Jython , and any other system with a garbage collector more advanced than CPython ’s reference counting , the local variables are n’t guaranteed to be deallocated at the end of the function , and therefore the weakref can still be alive .
Truthfully , I ’m not 100 % sure how this results in the next signal being sent not to store the appropriate data , but it does .
The solution is the make sure that the signals are manually disconnected at the end of the run .
This was fixed in r12964 of Django .
The next issue was actually a problem in PyPy , specifically it was crashing with a UnicodeDecodeError .
When I say crashing I mean crashing in the C sense of the word , not the Python , nice exception and stack trace sense … sort of .
PyPy is written in a language named RPython , RPython is Pythonesque ( all valid RPython is valid Python ) , and has exceptions .
However if they are n’t caught they sort of propagate to the top , they give you a kind - of - ok stacktrace , but its function names are all the generated function names from the C source , not useful ones from the RPython source .
Internally , PyPy uses an OperationError to keep track of exceptions at the interpreter level .
A trick to debugging RPython is , if running the code on top of CPython works , than running it translated to C will work , and the contrapositive appears true as well , if the C does n’t work , running on CPython wo n’t work .
After trying to run the code on CPython , the location of the exception bubbled right to the top , and the fix followed easily .
These are the first two issues I fixed , a couple others have been fixed and committed , and a further few have also been fixed , but not committed yet .
I ’ll be writing about those as I find the time .
My letter to Hudson :
As a frequent traveller for business , via NYC area airports and trains , I have noticed that your newstands play " Fox News " continuously in public spaces .
I have been told by store managers that this is due to contract you have to do so .
As you know , " Fox News " is both partisan , one - sided and biased .
Not only do independent surveys show that people who watch " Fox News " know more things that are objectively not true then people who watch other news outlets , but Fox News has also been actively promoting violence against government employees .
As an American citizen who happens to be a low - level career ( non-policial ) government employee with a wife and kids , and on this the anniversary of the right - wing hate - media inspired domestic terrorism of Oklahoma City , I am asking you to change the channel .
American is a free country .
People have the choice to play any channel they wish .
But a corporate choice to play Fox News in public spaces also has consequences .
If you choose to play Fox News , at your stores , in public spaces , then you are choosing to associate your company with them .
Your products of newspapers , magazines , candy , drinks and incidentals are commoditities .
They are available from many outlets .
And people also have a right to freely choose which company they buy them from .
I sent the letter before 9:00 AM eastern time , and was hoping for something back by 5:00 PM eastern time , but so far nothing .
Look folks , this is how the corporate interconnectedness works against any real left populism :
On the one hand , while they certainly had some other problems , let us not forget the role that an organized corporate advertising boycott was part of the weakness and demise of Air Amerca .
By contrast , at least since the Powell Memorandum was operationalized by William Simon , the nastiest elements of corporate America have known exactly what they need to do , to work together to get their word out .
Writ large , it is the interlocking combination of rich right wing individuals , many coporations , their lobbyists and assorted beltway bandits , 99 % of the Republican Party and 50 % of the Democratic Party , and of course the right wind noise machine .
And writ small , it is the exclusive contract of Hudson to sell newspapers in many airports and railway stations , coupled with their exclusive contract to blast Fox " News " in these busy commuter public - private spaces .
So far there is no adequate counter - balance to the right wing noise machine of which Fox " News " is the most important .
The mainstream corporate media is blandly even - handed with false equivalence most of the time .
The so - called liberal station MSNBC has two hours of liberal programming per day , and is not seen in malls , airports and train stations nationwide .
Meanwhile one small thing we can do is ask them to change the channel and turn off Fox " News . "
Or boycott their goods and services .
It ’s been a while since I wrote about XMPP and XMPP4r .
I ’m glad because my introductory posts on this topic were very well received .
Today I want to push further and share with you a tutorial - like post explaining step by step how to build a simple application with a XMPP interface .
The complete listing is also available on bitbucket
The application
I could n’t find something better than writing a xmpp weather bot .
You type the name of a city and the bot answers with the current temperature and forecast information using the Google Weather API .
Simple enough for this tutorial .
The gems you ’ll need to install
XMPP4r : sudo gem install xmpp4r
json_pure , to convert ruby hashes into json : sudo gem install json_pure
Crack , a xml and json parser : sudo gem install crack
starling , a ruby message queue : sudo gem sources -a http://gems.github.com/
&& sudo gem install starling - starling
Then , start the starling daemon by typing : sudo starling -d
Why using a message queue like starling ?
starling is a message queue library that speaks the memcache protocol .
It is my opinion that a message queue is often a very clever and powerful way to establish a direct communication between the various parts of an application or even between different applications .
For the sake of this tutorial , I wanted to separate our application into two distinct components and I did n’t want these components to talk to each other via the http protocol .
We wo n’t install a XMPP server
We wo n’t go to the pain of installing a XMPP server like ejabberd or openfire because it would be beyond the scope of this article .
Instead , we ’ll simply use a Google account for our bot
Application architecture
Like I said , I wanted to separate the application into 2 components :
The xmpp listener and the backend logic .
You probably already guessed that the xmpp listener component job will be to send and receive xmpp stanzas to the user at the other end .
To get the weather data , our listener will send the request to the backend component via a starling message queue that we ’ll name backend .
The backend component will do what is needed to compute the weather data and it will send the result back to the listener component via another starling message queue that we ’ll name listener
This setup might be overkill for our simple app but one of my objective was to show you how easy and interesting it can be to work with message queues .
Let ’s get the ball rolling .
The listener component
create a new file in your code editor and give it the name listener.rb .
Here is the complete source code for this file .
I will add comments at the bottom of the listing .

Important parts of this listing
I hope that you will find the code above self explaining .
However , here are a few important things about the listing .
At line 98 - 99 , we set 2 versions of the same message that will be sent to the XMPP user : one in plain text , the other in XHTML .
If the client at the other end has support for XHTML messages , the XHTML version will be displayed , otherwise the plain text version will be used .
This is a pretty interesting feature of the XMPP protocol .
The process_queue method
We start a new thread , we subscribe to the ‘ listener ’ message queue and we process our job list until the program ends or gets interrupted ( by typing Ctrl - C for example ) .
You can see that by using a message queue , we move away from the traditional “ Request / Response ” paradigm .
In our case the request ( line # 44 ) is “ disconnected ” from the response ( line # 103 ) .
Finally , at line # 129 we stop the main thread ( not the same thread that we started in process_queue ) .
We do this for an obvious reason : we do n’t want our script to terminate once it will reach the end of the file .
We just ask him to wait until the other threads are done executing .
The backend component
It is here that we will fetch , compute and prepare the actual weather data .
For the sake of this tutorial I use the google weather API but it could have been anything else .
Create a new file in your code editor and call it backend.rb

Brooks Laich changes a tire after Game 7
Mary Ann Wangemann and her 14 - year - old daughter Lorraine were already in a fairly poor mood Wednesday night .
The Washington Capitals -- the first sports team they had rooted for together , the team that prompted 49 - year old Mary Ann to begin painting her face before games and to sign up for a season - ticket waiting list -- had been eliminated in Game 7 of the NHL playoffs .
The season was over .
A lot of people were n't sure quite how to react to this loss .
When you put a lot of emotion into something -- even something as silly as a sports team -- and you can feel sort of empty when it goes away .
One fan e-mailed me to ask , quite seriously , whether I thought any Caps threw the series for gambling reasons .
Another , who said he 's rooted for the Caps for 28 years , sent me an e-mail that included 49 exclamation marks .
So the Wangemanns were driving home to Ashburn , and they got on the Roosevelt Bridge , trying to remain optimistic about the future of the team .
Then they hit a pothole and got a flat tire .
Perfect ending to the night .
Mary
Ann pulled over to the side of the bridge , and called AAA .
They said they had a heavy volume of calls , and that they were n't sure how long it would take to send help .
Mary Ann and Lorraine , still wearing their Caps gear , got out of the car and watched the traffic whiz by .
" We were getting a little spooked , " she told me .
" You feel pretty vulnerable right there . "
Finally , an SUV slowed down ahead of them and pulled over .
And then Brooks Laich got out and asked if he could help .
Mary Ann Wangemann and her daughter , Lorraine .
( Family photo )
Since the AAA folks were already on the way , Mary Ann asked Brooks -- whom she immediately recognized -- if he'd just wait with them by the side of the road .
Instead , he asked whether they had a spare .
Mary
Ann said they did .
So he took off his jacket -- he was still wearing his postgame suit -- got out the tire , and started jacking up the car .
" He was like an angel , I 'm telling you , " Mary Ann told me .
" Ca n't say enough nice things about him . "
( The Caps had nothing to do with sending out this story , but they did get in touch with Laich to confirm it for me . )
The thing took a while , as late - night tire changes on the side of bridges often do .
So they started talking hockey .
Laich , who scored the team 's only goal in Game 7 , apologized to them for the Caps losing .
They told him how great the season had been and how much they liked this team .
Laich said he hoped they got a chance to stay together .
The jack fell down , and he had to start again .
Lorraine stood behind him , mouthing to her mom over and over , " It 's Brooks Laich !
It 's Brooks Laich ! "
Laich was friendly but somber as he worked .
Mary Ann -- who had never before cared about a sports team -- talked about why she liked this group so much , and how they seemed so nice off the ice .
" We 're just people , too , " Laich said .
The whole thing lasted maybe 40 minutes .
Laich got the tire changed , and cautioned Mary Ann to drive slowly on the way home , to listen closely for any rattling sounds .
She agreed , and said she did n't know how she could possibly thank him .
" I 'm sure you 'll do something nice for someone in the future , " Laich responded .
He hugged them and drove off .
By this point , another car had pulled over , also with a flat tire .
Mary
Ann went to see how she could help , and told the other driver what had just happened .
Then -- after making sure the other driver was going to be okay -- she and her daughter got in their car and drove home .
Within 30 seconds , of course , Lorraine had updated her Facebook page to alert the world that Brooks Laich had just changed their tire .
That loss sure stung , but Mary Ann and her daughter figure they 'll keep their spot on the waiting list for next season .
" When you think about what he was going through yesterday , just the disappointment ... "
Mary
Ann said .
" Given everything else going on in his life , I just thought it was really remarkable .
I want people to know it . "
" Okay , that 's enough .
You 've talked to the kid , now leave the money and the cat toys under the bridge as we instructed you . "

LOS ANGELES ( MarketWatch ) --
While lawmakers and President Barack Obama are lamenting premium hikes of up to 39 % that Anthem Blue Cross of California plans to charge policy - holders , Lori Creasey says that 's nothing .
Try 69 % .
Creasey , a Huntington Beach , Calif . - based attorney , said she received notices late last year for the two individual Anthem policies she bought for her college - age sons .
For her 18 - year - old son , Kyle , the monthly premium was climbing to $ 135 from $ 80 , a 69 % hike .
Her 21 - year - old , Walter , saw his premium jump to $ 139 from $ 84 , a 65 % increase .
" I was kind of shocked when I got [ them ] , " Creasey said .
Anthem 's notices , dated Dec. 4 , said that " periodically , it is necessary to adjust our health - coverage rates , " and were signed by James E. Oatman , vice president and general manager of individual services for Anthem Blue Cross Life and Health Insurance Co .
Recent reports said the company planned to raise its rates up to 39 % , and Anthem had said the average increase stood at 25 % .
But this development , with rates increasing at a much greater percentage than that , raises questions about the extent of Anthem 's planned price hikes in California .
Even more perplexing is that Anthem seems to be driving up prices even higher on what is known in the industry as " invincibles , " or policy - holders under 30 that are generally considered at low health risk .
These are the customers that the industry desperately needs to help spread out the risks and costs from sicker patients .
In response to an inquiry about Anthem Blue Cross rates from MarketWatch , WellPoint Inc. 's WLP staff vice president for corporate communications , Jerry Slowey , sent the following statement via email : " It is important to note that premiums are expensive because the underlying health - care costs are expensive .
" Anthem regularly evaluates its rate structure to make sure that the cost of claims incurred is offset by the premiums collected , and that we anticipate the cost of future , expected claims , " the statement said .
Savvy consumer ?
Creasey , who is now semiretired , said she used to represent health insurers when she was practicing law full - time .
Considering herself a discriminating consumer of health - care policies , she regarded Anthem , a subsidiary of WellPoint , to be one of the better insurers available .
" I had experience with them in the past and thought they were fine and they had a lot of providers .
And they had the better hospitals too , " Creasey added .
Now , however , she wonders how the insurer can justify such high increases -- particularly when the only claims filed in the past year were for treating an ear infection for her older son .
" I just wanted to insure my healthy children , who are in college , " Creasey commented .
Anthem had said it would delay enforcing its price increase by two months to May 1 , but the hikes for Creasey 's sons took effect Feb. 1 , with no delay or grace period , she said .
The company has been under fire in recent weeks after reports surfaced that Anthem Blue Cross planned to increase premiums up to 39 % in California .
That drew ire from a number of lawmakers , as well as Obama , who mentioned it in a press briefing .
Sen. Dianne Feinstein , D - Calif. , announced Friday she planned to introduce legislation that would prevent " egregious " premium hikes and would create a Medical Insurance Rate Authority .
“ Sen. Dianne Feinstein plans to introduce legislation that would prevent ' egregious ' premium hikes and would create a Medical Insurance Rate Authority . ”
" This is unconscionable , " Feinstein said of the Anthem rate hikes in a statement .
" It places a huge burden on people who are already struggling in these tough economic times , including the estimated 700,000 Anthem Blue Cross policy - holders in California . "
Hearings planned
Rep. Henry Waxman , D - Calif. , who chairs the House Energy and Commerce Committee , has scheduled hearings next week , asking Anthem to justify their rate hikes .
Asked for a comment on Creasey 's case , Waxman said in a statement : " These new reports of premium increases of over 60 % are deeply troubling .
Our committee has opened an investigation into this issue , and I hope that next week we will hear directly from WellPoint as to how they justify these exorbitant rate increases . "
" This once again underscores the need for Congress to pass comprehensive health - care reform so that Americans have access to affordable health care and are protected from abusive insurance - company practices , " Waxman went on to say .
For her part , Creasey said she tried to file a complaint directly with Anthem .
Apparently she was referred her to a number that when dialed , repeatedly says that all circuits are busy .
Another Anthem representative told her she would file a grievance for her , but that it would be a " one-day grievance . "
The representative said " they do n't ever take any action on those grievances , " according to Creasey .
" It was kind of a cavalier attitude , I thought . "

Dell has unveiled the latest addition to its computer family , with a new hand - held tablet .
It is hoping the Dell Streak will rival Apple 's iPad .
Rory Cellan - Jones finds out what the new device has to offer .
This should come as no surprise , but The New York Times breathlessly informed us yesterday that US farmers are starting to have a hard time coping with Roundup - resistant weeds .
That ’s right .
Straight from the heart of the country where people do n’t want to see evolution taught , farmers are getting a real - life lesson in evolutionary theory .
I bet no one , absolutely no one , saw this one coming .
Here ’s how The Times presents it :
Just as the heavy use of antibiotics contributed to the rise of drug - resistant supergerms , American farmers ’ near - ubiquitous use of the weedkiller Roundup has led to the rapid growth of tenacious new superweeds .
To fight them , Mr. Anderson and farmers throughout the East , Midwest and South are being forced to spray fields with more toxic herbicides , pull weeds by hand and return to more labor - intensive methods like regular plowing .
“ We ’re back to where we were 20 years ago , ” said Mr. Anderson , who will plow about one - third of his 3,000 acres of soybean fields this spring , more than he has in years .
“ We ’re trying to find out what works . ”
Farm experts say that such efforts could lead to higher food prices , lower crop yields , rising farm costs and more pollution of land and water .
Well , this turns out to not be a new problem , exactly .
In fact , there were Round - up resistant weeks ten years ago , found in a soybean field .
And the problem has spread since then .
And The Times , which has never expressed much reluctance for any new crackpot scheme that also manages to benefit corporate America , ominously intones :
The superweeds could temper American agriculture ’s enthusiasm for some genetically modified crops .
Soybeans , corn and cotton that are engineered to survive spraying with Roundup have become standard in American fields .
However , if Roundup does n’t kill the weeds , farmers have little incentive to spend the extra money for the special seeds .
Roundup — originally made by Monsanto but now also sold by others under the generic name glyphosate — has been little short of a miracle chemical for farmers .
It kills a broad spectrum of weeds , is easy and safe to work with , and breaks down quickly , reducing its environmental impact .
Note that reference to a miracle .
The Times is sneaky that way .
Note also , if you actually go and read the article , that the enterprising Times reporters , William Neuman and Andrew Pollock , somehow manage to make it through the entire article without a single mention of the fact that Roundup - resistant seeds have been hugely controversial .
Nor do they mention Monsanto ’s interesting legal strategies to force farmers to stay on the Monsanto dole .
They do , however , pass along some interesting and possibly scary statistics , depending on your mood — roundup - resistant crops “ account for about 90 percent of the soybeans and 70 percent of the corn and cotton grown in the United States . ”
They also blame it on the farmers , a pretty neat trick when you think about it :
But farmers sprayed so much Roundup that weeds quickly evolved to survive it .
“ What we ’re talking about here is Darwinian evolution in fast - forward , ” Mike Owen , a weed scientist at Iowa State University , said .
Now , Roundup - resistant weeds like horseweed and giant ragweed are forcing farmers to go back to more expensive techniques that they had long ago abandoned .
So it was n’t the concept that had anything wrong with it .
It was those darn farmers who used the product too much .
Well , what would you expect ?
And , of course , the following should come as no surprise :
Monsanto , which once argued that resistance would not become a major problem , now cautions against exaggerating its impact .
“ It ’s a serious issue , but it ’s manageable , ” said Rick Cole , who manages weed resistance issues in the United States for the company .
Well , we certainly would n’t want to exaggerate the impact of this , would we ?
Except even Neuman and Pollock do manage to notice that this might cause a problem for Monsanto :
Of course , Monsanto stands to lose a lot of business if farmers use less Roundup and Roundup Ready seeds .
“ You ’re having to add another product with the Roundup to kill your weeds , ” said Steve Doster , a corn and soybean farmer in Barnum , Iowa .
“ So then why are we buying the Roundup Ready product ? ”
What does n’t get questioned here , not one teeny bit , is whether this is actually the model we want to use for agriculture :
Monsanto and other agricultural biotech companies are also developing genetically engineered crops resistant to other herbicides .
Bayer is already selling cotton and soybeans resistant to glufosinate , another weedkiller .
Monsanto ’s newest corn is tolerant of both glyphosate and glufosinate , and the company is developing crops resistant to dicamba , an older pesticide .
Syngenta is developing soybeans tolerant of its Callisto product .
And Dow Chemical is developing corn and soybeans resistant to 2,4 - D , a component of Agent Orange , the defoliant used in the Vietnam War .
Still , scientists and farmers say that glyphosate is a once - in - a - century discovery , and steps need to be taken to preserve its effectiveness .
Glyphosate “ is as important for reliable global food production as penicillin is for battling disease , ” Stephen B. Powles , an Australian weed expert , wrote in a commentary in January in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
To even ask the question of what Wendell Berry would think of all this is to already know the answer .
Especially the part about Dow ’s developing corn and soybeans resistant to Agent Orange — those of us with long memories will savour that part .
And it ’s probably not even worth pointing out that penicillin does n’t actually work that well any more , since bacteria initially targeted by penicillin have become more resistant .
Nature does tend to work that way .
And the fact that American agriculture has gotten itself into this mess is just another example of the vicious cycles that farmers , workers , ordinary citizens have gotten themselves stuck in in modern corporate America .
So it ’s an outright pleasure to then wander over to good old Obama Foodorama , which has been covering , in more detail than I ’ve actually seen elsewhere ( certainly not the NY Times ) the Obama administration ’s efforts to bolster Rural America .
Obama , of course , has not done things that many of us would have liked him to do , including myself .
But still , good effort should be rewarded , and the fact that the Obama people , particularly Ag Secretary Tom Vilsack , are promoting a National Summit on Rural America should be applauded .
In fact , the Obama people have been doing something that the tea partiers and Sarah Palin and their ilk would appreciate if they were paying attention — they ’re going out to the country and talking with people and listening to them .
This is actually pretty subversive of the federal government , if you think about it .
And it ’s hard to see Palin doing this sort of thing , actually — listening , that is .
A number of commentators these days ( like the well - meaning folks over at Front Porch Republic and similar sites ) are trying to figure out ways to revive localism in our lives , and our communities , and our workplaces .
Monsanto , and modern American agriculture ’s dependence on it and its competitors , is a case in point of what Americans need to break free from .
This is one of those “ getting there from here ” problems that seems to offer no simple solutions , probably because there are n’t any .
But the effort needs to be made .
Let ’s hope that the Obama Rural Tour is generating some ideas in this area , because farmers , certainly , may need them in the future .
Mr Bignone denied the charges
Argentina 's former military ruler Reynaldo Bignone has been sentenced to 25 years for human rights abuses committed almost three decades ago .
Gen Bignone , 82 , ordered abductions and torture while second in command of the country 's largest torture centre between 1976 and 1978 .
Relatives of victims held up photos of their loved ones and cheered at the end of the trial in Buenos Aires .
Six officials from the same era were also handed jail terms .
Gen Bignone , who served as de facto president between 1982 - 83 , was found guilty of involvement in 56 cases of murder , torture and kidnappings .
His charges were for crimes committed before becoming leader , when he was in charge of the notorious Campo de Mayo military base .

Campo de Mayo , outside Buenos Aires , is said to have been the largest in operation during the country 's seven - year Dirty War , which ended in 1983 .
" Justice was slow in coming but it has finally arrived , " said Estela de Carlotto , head of the human rights group Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo .
Human rights groups say some 30,000 people died or " disappeared " during the period , which saw the military target left - wing opponents .
The trial comes after amnesty laws , which had shielded perpetrators from charges , were overturned in 2005 by the country 's Supreme Court .
There are many experts who feel that the market potential of renewable energy will only be fully realized if smart grid technologies and services are successful .
But first , we need to define the smart grid .
In the broadest sense , “ smart ” refers to a kind of reactive and interactive capability of the energy transmission and distribution infrastructure that is driven both by the generators of electrons and the demands for those electrons .
So , the smart grid is defined as “ digital energy ” by those that focus on the information and communications technologies that will help build the interactive capability of its promise .
For the utility stakeholders , the smart grid is an “ intelligent utility infrastructure . ”
And because of that , utilities with have to change their business model ( and sometimes the regulatory context in which that model functions ) as well as make changes to their entire operations to encompass the commodity aspect of energy and step up their customer interactions .
Finally , some refer to it as the “ modern grid , ” recognizing that this new infrastructure represents a 21st century approach to retrofitting a 19th century understanding of energy flows .
I will be referring to the interaction between technologies and services in this space as the “ smart grid , ” since it seems that is becoming the dominant way to describe this new system .
Late last year , the DOE awarded $ 435 million to sixteen different smart grid pilot projects in the U.S.
A map of pilot projects can be found on OpenEI ’s Smart Grid Gateway .
In addition , the DOE organized a “ smart grid task force , ” whose activities and resources can be found here .
These projects represent field research on how all the different stakeholders and technologies will combine to expand these projects into a smart grid that will transform our infrastructure .
When awarding these funds , the DOE focused on these critical goals for the grid :
Increased reliability
Increased security
Greater economic efficiency
Greater energy efficiency
Improvements to the environment
Increased safety
Utilizing a vision ; not randomly implementing technologies
You may note that in this list , better integration of distributed renewable generation is not made distinct , though one could back into it through diversification of energy resources as increasing reliability and security .
Interestingly , just like the many definitions for the smart grid , there are many opinions about the need for renewable energy in the smart grid , with some feeling that renewables are central and others feeling renewables are irrelevant .
The DOE funded nine demonstration projects to specifically address the issue of renewable integration into the grid .
In these projects , it is looking for a 15 % peak load reduction on a distribution feeder through both renewable and efficiency technologies .
Pilot Project in Boulder
Right in NREL ’s backyard , a community scale “ demonstration ” smart grid project is underway in Boulder , CO .
The first in the U.S. the Denver smart grid demonstration project preceded those that are now in development as a result of the recent funding from DOE .
This initial experiment has had mixed reviews .
The success of the smart grid depends on the private and public sector ’s stakeholder involvement with systemic issues of transparency versus security .
According to many businesses that are building smart grid “ solutions , ” there are two aspects to the way that energy should be thought of in terms of efficiency .
Adrian Tuck , the CEO of Boulder - based smart grid company Tendril , recently gave testimony to Congress on the matter .
He said , “ Energy efficiency is best measured across at least two dimensions .
On the one hand , we can and must focus on improving the throughput efficiency of the electric system and the buildings it serves , including programs to fund improvements in insulation , caulking and replacing appliances .
On the other hand , we must also consider the real - time market and environmental information that can drive true transactional and behavior changes .
The impacts of these changes can drive tangible energy efficiency and environmental benefits . ”
In other words , consumers will ( hopefully ) make better energy choices if they have access to energy information in their homes and / or businesses .
“ Smart ” in the smart grid lexicon then also refers to smarter consumer choices .
It is this access to information that has some Boulder residents grumbling ; the smart meters exist in their homes , but the information that these meters are collecting in this program is not shared with the homeowner .
The utilities involved in Boulder were not able to provide energy information to the homeowners for a few reasons , most of which stem from their not being equipped to handle the onslaught of customer questions that they feared would come as a result .
In addition , a case can be made that consumer behavior would be even more changed if customers were billed based on time - of - use ( TOU ) pricing .
Since the utilities involved in this program did n’t have TOU pricing for residential customers in place , it could be argued that customer usage data would n’t have much value for the customers anyway .
Building customer information systems that are capable of accepting detailed demand data and displaying it for customers and customer service representatives who accept calls from customers will require massive utility investment .
Investing in and implementing this type of infrastructure and implementing TOU pricing requires approval by utility commissions , which can take years .
The challenge for all of us will be to align the right incentives for existing energy providers with the right mechanisms for sharing energy information with energy users .
Smart Grid and Renewables
Why is the smart grid so important to renewable energy generation , and specifically distributed renewable energy generation ?
If smart grid is done correctly , information in the electricity infrastructure will allow the grid to “ intelligently ” accept more energy from intermittent sources like solar and wind .
Without this intelligence , the existing grid will have difficulty incorporating larger amounts of intermittent renewable energy .
Think of the situation as analogous to the interaction between automobiles , roads and traffic lights .
If we were to introduce ever - increasing numbers of vehicles to our roads with no signals to direct the flow of traffic , the whole system would collapse quickly into accidents and blockages .
It is this “ intelligence ” – the signals that direct the traffic – that enables vehicles to move through the system relatively seamlessly .
Since the roads need to be accessible by the vehicles being introduced to the system , potentially more roads will need to be built to accommodate these new vehicles from wherever they originate .
Similarly , power generated from sustainable sources like wind and solar pose problems in terms of controlling how and when this power is generated and introduced into the grid .
Energy from these intermittent sources needs to be matched intelligently to the needs of the end user in order to be able to integrate these newer renewable resources as an asset to our energy infrastructure as opposed to a liability .
Without these measures , renewables may never penetrate markets beyond niche applications .
Those of us who have been working in renewables for years ( and my own organization having a 30 year track record ) , may bristle at the idea that we are “ new ” but if we are to become the status quo , smart grid may be an important element to how we get there .

Los Angeles is in deep trouble .
The situation has gotten so grim that the city controller says L.A. to Run Out of Cash in a Month .
Los Angeles will run out of cash on May 5 , city Controller Wendy Greuel said today in a release in which she requested a $ 90 million transfer of reserve funds to pay bills .
“ The question I have been asked most often during the budget crisis is , ‘ When will the city run out of money ? ” Greuel said in the e-mailed release .
“ Unfortunately , we finally have the answer . ”
Greuel , 48 , said in the release that the city might not be able to make payroll .
She asked Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and the City Council to release $ 90 million from reserve funds to meet what she described as “ an urgent cash need . ”
The controller ’s financial reporting division estimated that the city would need $ 90 million to ensure solvency through the fiscal year that ends June 30 , according to Golombek .
Reckless , Irresponsible Spending
Despite record income over the last five years , Mayor Villaraigosa has led the City down a path of reckless and irresponsible spending that would have been avoided by a more professional and logical City Official .
In the face of a crushing recession , the Mayor actually accelerated spending and hiring to the point that the City may have to declare BANKRUPTCY before the end of 2010 .
While he is now asking City officials to eliminate 1000 city jobs , the Mayor has selfishly refused to fire a single member of his enormous staff - including 16 Deputy Mayors and 93 personal staff members .
In 2009 , the Mayor offered a 3.9 BILLION dollar contract to the IBEW ( Electricians Union ) for the potential construction of solar panels .
The no -bid contract , awarded without competition to his political supporters , creates the appearance of corruption and collusion , and would have increased costs for citizens of Los Angeles .
Taxes and Economic Policies
Taxes
Villaraigosa has tripled the city 's trash collection fee from $ 11 per month to $ 36.32 per month for single - family homes .
Villaraigosa supports Proposition O , which currently adds $ 10.22 to the property tax bill of a $ 350,000 home and will eventually climb to $ 35 .
The mayor also campaigned last fall for two education bond measures that will increase the size of property tax bills over the next decade .
LADWP Controversy
On March 23 , 2010 , Villaraigosa in a leaked memo , warned the Los Angeles City Council that their potential failure to support a series of four proposed rate increases totaling 37 % and already approved by the city 's Department of Water and Power would be " the most immediate and direct route to bankruptcy the city could pursue " .
Water use
On August 10 , 2007 , The Los Angeles Times published an expose on water use by Villaraigosa at his private residences .
During the Summer of 2007 , Villaraigosa challenged Los Angeles residents to slash their water use by 10 % in the face of an historic drought .
" Los Angeles needs to change course and conserve water to steer clear of this perfect storm , " Villaraigosa said then .
But DWP records obtained by the Los Angeles Times show that he and his family used 386,716 gallons of water at their Mount Washington home , far higher than the average of 209,000 gallons .
Villaraigosa blamed his high water use on " gophers that chewed holes through a rubberized drip - irrigation system . "
Labor Organizer
Villaraigosa been criticized because of the high frequency in which he holds press conferences , attends photo - ops , and travels out - of - town ( including campaigning for Hillary Clinton ) .
Before being elected to public office , Villaraigosa was a labor organizer .
Villaraigosa served as a national co-chairman of Hillary Rodham Clinton 's 2008 presidential campaign and as a member of President Barack Obama 's Transition Economic Advisory Board .
L.A. is bankrupt
When a politician says something is " not an option " that generally means it is ( or soon will be ) .
... LA is bankrupt , all we are talking about here is whether the city realizes it or not .
The mayor 's statements prove he does not fully realize the gravity of the situation .
Villaraigosa is unfit for office .
If LA 's unpaid creditors start attaching assets , the mayor has no choice .
Literally .
He would have to immediately terminate all LA employees before they accrued federal tax trust amounts .
If he allows those amounts to accrue without funds to pay them , he 's committed a federal felony .
Here 's how it works .
Basically , you can stiff creditors generally or " stretch " them as is the bankruptcy parlance .
So though somebody is on 30 day terms , you effectively fall behind and pay them effectively on 90 day terms .
And on one - time creditors whom you do n't need in the future , you just stiff them .
So long as you have enough cash to pay the employees for the tax trust fund accounts they are accruing -- and generally for their compensation -- you can keep skating .
So if LA or Illinois ever get that low on cash , a filing will happen .
Also if lots of those little ( and not so little ) creditors get restless and sue , you start having problems .
They can move for pre-judgment attachments of cash -- freezing cash and preventing it from being used for other purposes -- like paying employees or putting money away for trust funds .

China ’s property bubble
Takatoshi Ito
One objection to the calls for China to let its currency appreciate argues that the yen 's appreciation during the 1980s was a cause of Japan ’s “ lost decade ” .
This column instead blames policymakers for not dealing with Japan ’s property bubble early enough .
China should learn from these mistakes with its own property bubble and let the renminbi appreciate .
Many of our Chinese friends who live in Shanghai and Beijing are telling us that the property inflation rate exceeds 50 % – and 100 % in some areas .
Available housing for a young couple is far from downtown , closer to one - hour commuting distance , and still more than ten times the average salary .
There are also reports that the state government is borrowing with “ protected ” forest land as collateral ( Dyer 2010 ) .
However , these stories do not match the Chinese official data ( National Bureau of Statistics of China 2010a ) .
The Chinese official statistics say that the average increase ( year - on - year ) in property prices was 10.7 % in February .
The increase is accelerating from a year - on - year rise of 9.5 % in January .
The official data may be significantly underestimating the real price increases , due partly to a statistical bias to be explained below .
Some break down of statistics is available .
The rate of price increases of newly - built residential buildings ( at 90 square meters and below ) in Beijing , Shanghai , and Shenzhen are 19.3 % , 11.6 % and , 19.6 % , respectively ( National Bureau of Statistics of China 2010 b ) .
In the same category , the highest property inflation was in Sanya , Hainan Island , at 57.9 % .
However , the location ( within a city ) and quality ( beyond “ new ” vs. “ used ” ; and “ average ” and “ small ” ) of the buildings are most likely not controlled for in the official statistics .
Granted , the 70 - city breakdown is available , but not within the city ; “ new ” and “ used ” is differentiated but no information on how old the used units are ; and statistics on “ smaller ” units are available , but still each break down category is still coarse .
Beyond “ average prices , ” no detailed statistical description is available .
Suppose that prices are rising uniformly at the same rate in downtown and in the suburb .
Since more expensive properties are less demanded , more units in the suburb ( at lower price levels ) will be supplied to the market .
Thus , the “ average ” price increase will be lower than the uniform , true rate of the price increases .
More buildings are sold in the second - tier suburbs than the first - tier , and even less in the downtown area , the “ average ” price may be lower than the location - controlled index .
The official statistics most likely underestimates the size of housing bubble .
In real estate economics , the location - adjusted , and quality - adjusted property price index can be constructed by :
the sampling of repeated - sale ( identical ) properties ( like the Case - Shiller index ) ,
by running a hedonic regression ( in many academic studies for particular cities ) , ( Ito and Hirono 1993 on Japanese housing data ) , or
housing data ) , by using expert appraisal ( like the frequently - quoted Japanese land price index ) .
Having a location - and quality - adjusted property price index is critical for timely policy decisions .
Reminiscent of the Japanese bubble
What is happening in China now is familiar to any Japanese who lived through the bubble in the second half of the 1980s ( and its subsequent burst ) .
From the mid-1980s to 1990 , Japan experienced one of the largest property bubbles in history .
The land price index tripled in five years .
The 6 - large city price index for residential land rose from 39.2 in September 1985 to 105.8 in September 1990 .
The commercial land price rose from 27.9 to 104.5 .
At the initial stage , the land price rose in the central part of Tokyo , then spread to first - tier suburbs in Tokyo , then to other large cities and second - tier suburbs , and finally to rural land and forest .
The recent US housing bubble had a similar process of moving from prime to subprime mortgages .
The quality of borrowers progressively worsened both in Japan and the US .
The loan - to - value ratio rose sharply toward the end of bubble .
Is this bubble now being repeated in China ?
Yes , Chinese property prices increases seem to share many of the features of the Japanese property bubble in the 1980s .
Of course , that does not necessarily mean that the Chinese bubble would collapse like Japanese .
Chinese economic growth potential now is much higher than Japan in 1990 .
Chinese banks are still under heavy control of the state , so that any policy restraints on further fuelling to the bubble would be more effective in China than in Japan .
It is important to learn what caused a bubble , why it could not be stopped before it became too big , what went wrong in crisis management when it burst .
In the following , I provide a short summary ( see Cargill et al. 1997 and 2001 for a comprehensive analysis ) .
Lessons from the Japanese bubble and burst
The Japanese property price started to increase with strong fundamentals and financial deregulation in the mid-1980s .
In the beginning ( say , 1984 to mid-1987 ) , property price increases seemed reasonable and well - justified with strong macro fundamentals .
Real demand came from a few booming sectors , like newly deregulated financial services .
Foreign investors were interested in Japanese assets including stocks and real estate .
Monetary policy remained very lax ( i.e. , the official discount rate being 2.5 % , a record low at the time ) from mid-1987 to mid-1989 .
Both stock prices and land prices kept rising , partly helped by the low interest rate .
However , some time later ( mid -1987 to end - 89 ) , the process became a bubble – that is , people invest in the property only to aim at capital gains .
A leverage ratio became higher in pursuit of higher yields and as banks became more confident that the value of collateral would continue rising .
The first lesson is that a bubble , which can be suspected from rising loan - to - value ratio , rising price - rental ( dividend ) ratio , increasing bank lending to the real estate sectors , and real estate developments in further - away suburbs , should be restrained by a higher interest rate and prudential regulation on banks ’ behaviour .
In the second half of the 1980s , monetary tightening and stronger regulatory measures should have been applied in 1987 - 89 .
The bubble might not have been completely avoided purely by monetary tightening , but the damage might have been reduced by early tightening and prudential regulations .
The great stagnation during most of the 1990s and the 2000s is rooted in the bubble and its burst .
However , policy mistakes that came after mistakes during the two decades were also to blame .
First , monetary policy was too tight when the burst bubble occurred to mitigate negative wealth effects , especially in 1991 and 1992 ( see Ito et al. 2006 ) .
Second , fiscal stimulus was too little and too late to make large impacts as pump priming .
It eventually raised the debt level without lifting the economy .
Fiscal tightening in April 1997 and monetary tightening in August 2000 was clearly premature and misguided .
Last but not least , the banking crisis was mishandled –forbearance for many years and timid capital injection – and protracted .
In the 1992 - 94 , smaller housing loan institutions became fragile , but the problem was not dealt with immediately .
The problem spread to ordinary banks , and then to large banks .
Early , decisive actions would have mitigated , if not prevented , the problems among very large banks in 1997 - 98 .
US demands , yen appreciation and a bubble
Many Chinese officials tell us that they believe the origin of Japan ’s 20 - year stagnation after its housing bubble burst lies in its failure to stand up to US pressure for the yen to appreciate .
They cite this presumption as one of the reasons why they resist US pressure to allow the renminbi to appreciate .
What is the logic behind this ?
There are three possibilities :
The US pressure to appreciate the yen made the bubble size bigger ;
The US pressure to appreciate the yen made economic slump from bursting bubble worse ; and
The US pressure to appreciate the yen made the Japanese export sector to lose competitiveness that caused the 20 - year decline .
I examine these three possibilities , one by one .
The US pressure for yen appreciation was most prominent on two occasions .
First , the Plaza Agreement of September 1985 pushed up the value of the yen sharply .
Just before that agreement , the yen was at 240 yen per dollar .
Three months later , it appreciated to 200 yen per dollar – a 20 % appreciation .
The yen continued to appreciate to 155 yen per dollar by August of 1986 – a 45 % appreciation compared with the pre-Plaza level .
Second , the yen sharply appreciated from 100 yen to the dollar in January 1995 to 80 yen per dollar in May 1995 .
This period coincides with US frustration with Japan over trade conflicts , and the market interpreted that the US pressure was threatening Japan with a choice of trade sanction or yen appreciation .
However , this appreciation episode was short - lived , as the yen depreciated back to 100 yen to the dollar by September 1995 .
Is the first US pressure , the Plaza Accord , the source of the 20 - year stagnation ?
Given the timing , if the pressure resulted in making the bubble larger than otherwise , that causality may be established .
However , the truth is just the opposite .
First , the Plaza Accord was to correct an overvalued dollar against other major currencies – the yen was only one of them .
Second , movement from 240 to 200 yen to the dollar was well in the range of correcting the overvalued dollar , and there was no objection from Japan .
When the yen appreciated beyond 190 yen per dollar in the spring of 1986 , interventions started to stop yen appreciation .
However , the yen kept appreciating .
The US agreed to stabilise the exchange rate with the Louvre Accord in February 1987 , and it was widely believed that the target zone of 150 - 160 yen / dollar was agreed between Japan and the US .
Indeed , the exporting sector suffered because of the sharp appreciation from 1985 to 1987 .
But the recession of 1986 was short - lived .
One offsetting factor was the oil price decline in 1986 .
The yen tended to appreciate ( or depreciate ) when the oil price declined ( or increased ) , respectively .
Monetary policy was relaxed from 1986 to 1987 , and the record - low discount rate ( at that point ) of 2.5 % was maintained from February 1987 to May 1989 , with a hope that low interest rate would stop or moderate the speed of yen appreciation .
Hence , it was not caving in to yen appreciation demand but resistance to US pressure which made monetary policy too lax and contributed to bubble enlargement .
The logic is just the opposite of what Chinese officials may believe .
How about the second episode ?
Trade conflicts over automobiles in 1994 to 1995 led to US frustration .
However , the yen appreciation pressure from 1994 to 1995 was more informal than during the first episode .
Investors appreciated the yen whenever Japan was reported to have resisted US pressure for numerical targets of “ voluntary import expansion . ”
From macroeconomic reasons , no factors were supporting a sudden appreciation from 100 to 80 yen per dollar in five months .
So , decisive interventions directed by Mr. Sakakibara , then Director General of the International Finance Bureau , brought the yen back to 100 yen per dollar .
It is also evidence that the appreciation had no fundamental basis .
Since the appreciation was so short a period , it is doubtful that exporting sectors suffered a permanent damage .
In either episode , US demand for yen appreciation has little relevance for the 20 - year stagnation of Japan .
What is to be blamed is a series of policy mistakes : not preventing a bubble from becoming too large , not addressing the bursting bubble early enough , and not dealing with the banking problem decisively in the early stages .
Concluding remarks
In failing to prevent a bubble from getting bigger and bigger , the Chinese authorities are making a mistake – low interest rate policy and resisting currency appreciation – similar to Japan ’s in the 1980s .
China ’s reported inflation rate does not show rampant CPI inflation , but there was no CPI inflation in Japan in the 1980s .
The property bubble is a clear sign of overheating .
Trade surpluses were large both in Japan in the 1980s and in China now .
The first best policy is interest rate hikes to restrain the property boom , resulting as well in an appreciation of the Chinese renminbi that prevents hot money inflows .
The Chinese authorities are already taking some measures to restrain banks from increasing credits to the property sector – tightening regulations of loan - to - value ratios and increasing the reserve requirement and this should continue .
If the renminbi does appreciate , overheating of China ’s export sectors will be slowed , while standards of living will improve with higher purchasing power .
China did allow the renminbi to rise from July 2005 to 2008 by 20 % .
Yet , productivity increases in China ’s export sector overcame this appreciation , and trade surpluses grew .
The Chinese renminbi was re-pegged to the dollar in the summer of 2008 , and remains so until now .
It is high - time China lets its currency appreciate once again .
It should not fail to do so just to confront the US .
China should maximise its own welfare whether or not that is what the US wants .
Renminbi appreciation is clearly good for macro management .
It gives more policy tools to the People ’s Bank of China and is beneficial to the standard of living of the general public .
China should learn the right lessons from the Japanese experience .

For decades , shoppers have taken advantage of coupons .
Now , the coupons are taking advantage of the shoppers .
A new breed of coupon , printed from the Internet or sent to mobile phones , is packed with information about the customer who uses it .
While the coupons look standard , their bar codes can be loaded with a startling amount of data , including identification about the customer , Internet address , Facebook page information and even the search terms the customer used to find the coupon in the first place .
And all that information follows that customer into the mall .
For example , if a man walks into a Filene ’s Basement to buy a suit for his wedding and shows a coupon he retrieved online , the company ’s marketing agency can figure out whether he used the search terms “ Hugo Boss suit ” or “ discount wedding clothes ” to research his purchase ( just do n’t tell his fiancée ) .
Coupons from the Internet are the fastest - growing part of the coupon world — their redemption increased 263 percent to about 50 million coupons in 2009 , according to the coupon - processing company Inmar .
Using coupons to link Internet behavior with in - store shopping lets retailers figure out which ad slogans or online product promotions work best , how long someone waits between searching and shopping , even what offers a shopper will respond to or ignore .
Normal people do n't like today 's computers .
Most loathe them because they can't fully understand their absurd complexity and arcane conventions .
That 's why the iPad will kill today 's computers , just like the latter killed computers running with punchcards and command lines .

Of course , the iPad — the actual product that millions will buy in the coming months — wo n't replace all computers .
The entire world is not going to run just on tablets , just like the world does n't run only on smartphones and personal computers now .
But Steve Jobs ' Next Big
Thing is the first computer that requires no training whatsoever , one that is truly accessible and useful for everyone .
Just like the iPhone changed the idea of what a phone should be without anyone truly realizing it , Apple 's new computer will completely and permanently change our idea of what a computer is and how it should behave .

The perception change will be so deep that it will kill Mac OS X , Windows and Linux as we know them today .
At one point during this decade , you will no longer have a billion folders and file icons floating in a virtual desktop .
There will be no more baffling setup screens .
No more shortcuts to work around limitations and old conventions .
These frustrating barriers — built during decades of evolution — are what make normal people hate computers .
These barriers have now been obliterated , first by the iPhone and now by the iPad .
Everyone will be using computers similar to the iPad .
Not in terms of hardware , form factor , and specs .
But on its philosophy .
Even the naysayers would have abandoned the Desktop Metaphor by them ( in fact , some naysayers already bought theirs ) .

That is what is important about the Apple 's new mobile computer .
It shows that computers have — must — be an invisible platform , one that shifts its appearance to give people the tools to complete the tasks they want to accomplish , whatever these are .
To enjoy and create content .
To play .
To communicate .
To work .
By being invisible and letting the applications do the work in the most simple way possible , the power of the computer will , at last , be available for everyone .
No previous knowledge required .
From a 3 - year - old baby to your 90 - year - old grandma , people will be able to just do things .

Some say that this is not possible .
They focus on the anecdote and not on the big picture .
They dismiss the computing model change that the iPad brings — and the new mobile computer itself — anchored in their preconception of what computing should be .
They are forgetting that history shows that the change is not only possible , it 's inevitable .
It has happened before .
Many times .
And it 's happening again .

At the end of World War II , the power of computers was controlled by the scientists who built them using tens of thousands of vacuum tubes , diodes , relays , and resistors .
They were extremely expensive and hard to maintain , so there were only a handful of them , greedily guarded by governments and the military .
Advertisement
Then the transistor and the punchcard appeared .
Computers became a bit smaller , more powerful , less expensive .
Advertisement
Their new power was quickly seized by a larger group of high priests , who began to harness it for big businesses .
Advertisement
A few years later , the command line was invented .
Even smaller computers — which still required a lot of money to buy and maintain — started to pop up in medium - sized companies .
A new elite took over , the old guard cried , and punchcards faded out .
Advertisement
After that , the first personal computers arrived , and the elite further expanded , now including hobbyists , tech students , entrepreneurs and small - business owners .
Like with all the previous steps in this evolution , the personal computer was despised by the older castes , who had spent time learning the mysteries of the more ancient arts .
The incumbents said the personal computer was inadequate and underpowered .
It could n't even multitask , unlike their glorious , room - filling computers .
The personal computer would never catch on , they cried .
They were wrong .

In 1984 , Apple introduced Macintosh , a personal computer that changed the command line for something called the " graphical user interface " and the " desktop metaphor , " a representation of reality with icons set over the representation of your work desk .
Its memory and storage capacity was very limited , but it allowed people to access computers and be productive with them with a lot more ease than command lines , punchcards , and switches .
Microsoft followed this model later .
Advertisement
Once again , the previous elites laughed because they thought the GUI was n't as powerful as the command line .
Despite that , the people who jumped into this new computing concept showed that they were more productive in these computers than " the others " .
Shortly after , this desktop metaphor took over the world , further democratizing the access to computing power .

That 's where we are today .
Time to kill the computer
The problem is that the desktop metaphor is not good enough .
Despite its relative ease of use , most people still find computers difficult to use .
Now , if you actually like computers , you probably do n't sense much of a struggle when managing Mac OS X or Windows .
But watching some of your friends and family will make it painfully obvious :
Most people are still baffled by conventions that many of us take for granted .
Advertisement
What 's worse , the ramping - up of storage capability and functionality has made the desktop metaphor a blunder more than an advantage :
How could we manage the thousands of files that populate our digital lives using folders ?
Looking at my own folder organization , we can barely , if at all .
Apple and Microsoft have tried to tackle this problem with database - driven software like iTunes or Windows Media Center .
Instead of managing thousands of files " by hand , " this kind of software turns the computer into an " information appliance , " giving an specialized interface to organize your photos or music or video .

The iPad fully embraces that solution .
It puts that idea — photos , music , movies , documents of all kinds stored into task - oriented specialized databases — together with the fully modal , task - oriented interface of the iPhone , loaded with amazing applications that will let you do everything you can imagine , for pleasure or work .
It 's the realization of universal information appliance proposed by genius like Alan Kay and Jef Raskin in the ' 70s .

How and where you 'll use the iPad are of the essence .

( CNN ) -- Dozens of tips have poured in after California authorities released more than 100 photos of women and children on Thursday that are believed to have been taken by a serial killer who appeared on the " Dating Game . "
Police determined Friday that two female minors in the pictures , taken in the 1970s , are alive and well .
They have received tips on a handful of other women who could be dead or missing , according to Patrick Ellis , a detective with the Huntington Beach Police Department .
" We 've received several calls saying that someone in a photo could be so - and - so who 's been missing or found dead , " Ellis said Friday .
" The response has been overwhelming , and that 's what we were looking for . "
Investigators are trying to determine whether any of the people in the photos were victims of Rodney Alcala , 66 , who was convicted in February of kidnapping and murdering a 12 - year - old girl and raping and murdering four Los Angeles County women in the 1970s .
A jury this week recommended he be sentenced to death .
Ellis said police received tips on as many as four dead or missing women who were identified by other people calling and e-mailing about the photos .
" People are saying that they recognize someone from their past , from school or college or the neighborhood beach , " he said .
The two women who identified themselves from the photos on Friday were minors at the time the pictures were taken and are now in their 40s , Ellis said .
Police are not releasing their identities , though Ellis said they live in California .
Nancy Grace blog :
See the photos
Huntington Beach Police are contacting law enforcement authorities across the country with information about dead or missing women who were identified by people calling or e-mailing on Friday , Ellis said .
He stressed that police have not confirmed that any of the women or children in the photos are dead or missing .
The portrait - style photographs were discovered in a storage unit Alcala kept in Seattle , Washington , said Orange County district attorney spokeswoman Susan Kang Schroeder .
The locker also contained earrings that belonged to Robin Samsoe , the 12 - year - old girl whom Alcala abducted and killed in 1979 .
The discovery of the earring in the locker has raised speculation that there may be other victims or that the photographs were trophies to Alcala , she said .
" We know that Mr. Alcala used his photography as a ruse to get close to his victims , " she said .
Authorities already believe that Alcala may be responsible for deaths in New York , Schroeder said .
" It 's very possible , " Schroeder said .
" Mr. Alcala is a predatory monster and we believe that he destroyed many lives everywhere he went . "
Alcala was convicted in 1972 of kidnapping and molesting a child in Los Angeles County in 1968 , according to the Orange County District Attorney 's office .
After serving a 34 - month sentence , he was released .
In 1978 , Alcala appeared as a " Bachelor No. 1 " on " The Dating Game . "
Jed Mills , who played " Bachelor No. 2 , " said he had an almost immediate aversion to Alcala .
" Something about him , I could not be near him , " Mills recalled .
" I am kind of bending toward the other guy to get away from him , and I do n't know if I did that consciously .
But thinking back on that , I probably did . "
But Alcala succeeded in charming Bachelorette Cheryl Bradshaw from the other side of the " Dating Game " wall .
But she declined her date with Alcala .
Anyone with information regarding the identities of the women and children in the photographs found in Alcala 's storage locker is asked to contact the Orange County District Attorney 's Office or the Huntington Beach Police Department .

Attorney General Eric Holder once lobbied for Global Crossing — sometimes described as the Democratic Enron — and White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel made eight figures in a little more than two years as the Chicago - based managing director at Wasserstein Perella & Co. between jobs as a senior aide in President Bill Clinton ’s White House and as the congressman representing Illinois ’s 5th District .
And the Democrats rode to their majorities in the House and the Senate on a wave of cash Emanuel and New York Sen.
Chuck Schumer helped them raise from Wall Street .
Earlier this month , a hedge fund manager at the center of the Goldman Sachs fraud case held a fundraiser for Schumer in New York .
“ It ’s pathetic , ” Sen. Bernie Sanders , a liberal Vermont independent who caucuses with the Democrats , said of news that Goldman Sachs has hired Craig .
“ But it ’s what goes on around here . ”
The Republican Party is still emphatically aligned with business , but in most cases unapologetically so .
For Democrats , the dance is trickier :
How do you reap the financial rewards of corporate America without offending your core political beliefs — or your party ’s committed base ?
Democrats say their willingness to tackle Wall Street with a tough regulatory reform bill is the best evidence that they are n’t compromised by their corporate connections .
But the regulatory reform push is also evidence that they know just how hard the political winds have shifted against a pro-business wing of the party that gained influence when Democrats were out of power .
The sensitivity is so great that , when a little - known aide to House Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank jumped ship for K Street earlier this month , Frank took the unusual step of vilifying him in public .
“ I wanted to make clear I share the unhappiness of people at this , and my intention [ is ] to prohibit any contact between him and members of the staff for as long as I have any control over the matter , ” Frank said in a press release .
“ I am therefore instructing the staff of the Financial Services Committee to have no contact whatsoever with [ the former aide ] on any matters involving financial regulation . ”
Sensing partisan advantage , Obama — a onetime Wall Street favorite who raised nearly $ 1 million from Goldman Sachs employees for his 2008 campaign — has been blasting away at Republicans , most notably Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R - Ky. ) , who opposes the current Senate version of an overhaul of financial services regulation .
“ Now , the Senate Republican leader , he paid a visit to Wall Street a week or two ago .
He took along the chairman of their campaign committee .
He met with some of the movers and shakers up there , ” Obama said at a Monday night fundraiser for Sen. Barbara Boxer ( D - Calif . ) .
“ I do n’t know exactly what was discussed .
All I can tell you is when he came back , he promptly announced he would oppose the financial regulatory reform . ”
National Republican Senatorial Committee Chairman John Cornyn said the president had “ demeaned himself and his office ” by issuing “ political attacks ” against Cornyn and McConnell for “ doing what Rahm Emanuel did . ”
Cornyn was referring to a report in The Washington Post noting that , on the same night Obama was blasting McConnell for visiting Wall Street , Emanuel attended a private cocktail reception with Democratic donors there .
Emanuel , in the unusual role of good cop , appears to be working to assuage the fears of investors with less strident language than that used by his boss .
“ This is important for America ’s leadership in the world .
We lead in the financial sector .
It ’s one of the parts in the economy we lead .
But if people do n’t trust our market , we ca n’t maintain that leadership .
That ’s why this regulatory reform is not against Wall Street ; it ’s fundamentally in the interest of the economy , ” he told television interviewer Charlie Rose .
“ Wall Street , though , has advanced beyond the regulatory supervision , and we need to catch up in a way that ensures that we do n’t have the crisis we had in the past and we ’re prepared for future ones . ”
Schumer ’s taking heat back home for not protecting the lifeblood of his state ’s economy , but standing up for Wall Street could cost him dearly in a future bid to be the Senate majority leader .
Some Democrats acknowledge that the legislation — and the harsh anti-Wall Street rhetoric — could cost them campaign contributions from the financial services sector in what is already shaping up to be a tough election year .
But that ’s a price they say they are willing to pay .
“ This is a time when politics has to take a back seat to what ’s good for the American people , ” said Pennsylvania Gov. Edward Rendell , a former chairman of the Democratic National Committee .
“ If that means we ca n’t raise money on Wall Street , so be it . ”
One congressional Democrat said the financial meltdown has forced the party to address regulation .
“ It ’s not as though Democrats got elected and decided , ‘ We ’re going to go after the financial services industry , ’ ” he said .
Craig ’s hiring shows that even as the Democratic political leaders abandon the Wall Street ship , the party still has people on board .
And though he ’s getting a cool reception from elected Democrats , Craig has defenders within the party , too .
“ Lawyers have a particular degree of latitude in this regard because we still believe that every client is entitled to a defense , ” said Jack Quinn , chairman of Quinn Gillespie & Associates , who served as counsel to Clinton from 1995 to 1997 .
“ Greg is a superb lawyer , and Goldman is fortunate to have him on its team . ”
The White House says its rules prevent undue influence from former administration officials , even though former officials can work as advisers rather than as lobbyists to circumvent them .
“ The president thinks that he does have tough rules in place , and he ’s going to continue to make sure that people abide by that rule , ” White House spokesman Bill Burton told reporters Tuesday .
A senior Senate aide disagreed .
“ Barack Obama has done his best to demonize lobbyists .
[ But ] we can pretty much predict that [ National Economic Council Director ]
Larry Summers will be making millions working for some hedge fund in two years .
And Rahm Emanuel made millions working for Wasserstein Perella .
But it ’s a distinction without a difference :
All these folks are cashing in on their contacts to make tons of money .
...
We all become more valuable after we serve in government , ” the aide said .
For liberals , many of whom remain skeptical of Democratic Party ties to the corporate world , the jury wo n’t be in on the regulatory overhaul until the fine print is set .
Only then will they know “ whether the Congress has the ability to regulate Wall Street or Wall Street continues to regulate the Congress , ” Sanders said .

Boalt Hall , UC Berkeley 's law school , controversially employs torture memo lawyer John Yoo .
As of today , its bathrooms also stock toilet paper rolls printed with text from the Convention Against Torture and the words " made possible by John Yoo . "
Bearded , LA - based prank " artist " Matt Cornell replaced Boalt 's toilet paper early this morning to " draw attention to the ongoing consequences of the torture memos . "
He also set up a website , YooToiletPaper.com .
Cornell says that his brand of toilet paper is softer and of higher quality than that provided by cash - strapped UC Berkeley and contains " valuable reading material " for law students .
I imagine it will get a lot of use today , as future lawyers tend to be full of shit .

Looks like Rachel Maddow did some dishonest " editing " at 6:56 to distort the CA AG report to make it look like Vera reported the “ human smuggling ” to the police immediately instead of 9 Days later .
Immediately after the couple left , Vera telephoned his cousin , Detective Alejandro Hernandez , at the National City Police Department .
[ He left a voicemail message for Detective Hernandez stating that some “ crazy people ” were in his office providing information .
Vera did not explain
the substance of the conversation and did not make reference to prostitution or human smuggling on the message .
He asked his cousin to call him back .
( Interview with Vera ; Vera Phone Records , at p. 4 [ reflecting a 2 - minute call to Detective Hernandez ’s cell phone at 6:40 p.m. ] ;
Detective Hernandez Phone Records , at p. 132 [ reflecting a call to voicemail at 6:45 p.m. ] . )
Later that day , Vera also reported the incident to fellow ACORN employee Cruz Acosta .
Acosta had been away from the office while the couple was present .
Vera explained to him what happened .
Vera also reported the incident , either the same day or shortly thereafter , to Mar 15
Murrillon , an ACORN board member .
Vera told Murrillon that he had reported the incident to the police .
( Vera Interview . )
Vera eventually spoke with Detective Hernandez on August 27 , 2009 .
He told Detective Hernandez ] [ and said ] that a self - admitted prostitute had been to the office and was discussing human
smuggling .

OK , Paul L ( @ # 1 ) , I 'll give you that one .
While I think it is an extremely minor offense when compared with O'keefe 's editing job ( on the order of several magnitudes different ) , nevertheless I am a stickler for accuracy and I agree that Rachel should have clarified that the actual reporting to Detective Hernandez occurred 9 days later .
However I do n't agree that this means Maddow deliberately quoted from Brown 's report in such a way as to have viewers misconstrue the timing .
It could have been merely sloppiness in the form of expediency .

So why did she say this after quoting the report ?
From the transcript of ' The Rachel Maddow Show ' for Tuesday , April 6 , 2010
He elicited as much information as he could get out of his supposed pimp and prostitute in his office and then he immediately reported it to the police .
For that he ended up getting fired after fantastical interpretations of his actions like these aired on Fox News .

I contacted Barbara Boxer 's office today to ask for a statement from the senator regarding her own vote to defund ACORN in Sept of last year and how she feels knowing she voted to do so based on fake evidence .
They took my contact info and said they would get back to me , though that does n't necessarily mean anything these days .
Every democrat in congress that voted to defund ACORN should be ashamed of themselves .
Not only for being taken for fools by Okeefe 's " evidence " , but that anyone with half a brain cell would have never taken the video has legitimate evidence to begin with .
You do n't need 4 independent investigations into the video to have seen from the very beginning it was a fraud .
If I do get a response from Boxer , I can post it here if people like .
Also , I run my own small politically oriented forum and we 've been talking about ACORN quite frequently .
The right wingers on the forum have used just about every talking point and lie about ACORN while repeating the conservative meme .
It 's sad .
My forum is at www.politicalslugfest.com if anyone is interested .
The members there cover the entire political spectrum , liberal , independent , libertarian , to right wing , and no one is ever censored .

I dunno , Paul L.
It 's a valid criticism , although I still say it does n't prove Rachel was deliberately misinforming .
Maybe she was .
Maybe exaggerating a little .
Another take is that she shortened / simplified her script where she could to keep to a few salient points , and she shortened it too much .
For example , take her sentence : " He elicited as much information as he could get out of his supposed pimp and prostitute in his office and then he immediately reported it to the police . "
Now add two words and I think it would have been legit : " He elicited as much information as he could get out of his supposed pimp and prostitute in his office and then he immediately attempted to [ report ] it to the police .
I give the benefit of the doubt and call it sloppy editing .
I also accept that she may have phrased things to make Vera 's actions look a little more proactive than they apparently were .
I agree she should n't have portrayed things differently than they were portrayed in her source , the AG 's report .
I count it a minor flaw in a very good show .
And I will watch her shows more carefully ( as I try to do with all news shows ) for evidence of bias .

Paul L.'s complaint is a straw man .
The gist of the fabricated O'Keefe story is that Acorn offices across the nation aided and abetted a prostitution and human smuggling ring .
The gist of the truth is that is simply untrue .
In the San Diego story it 's particularly untrue as the interviewer placed a call to his cousin the cop immediately after O'Keefe and Giles left his office .
Eventually he talked with is cousin about what he believed to be a human smuggling operation .
The substance of the truth , which reveals the O'Keefe story to be a lie , is not effected in the slightest by any misconceptions about whether he talked to his cousin immediately or days later .
There is no equivalency here of biased reporting by Rachel Maddow .

1st- @ Jim_NH , Dont look behind you , but I think Bertha Lewis is staring at you through the window !
She ’s also laughing at you from behind the fridge .
Wonderin ’ why all your sweat - socks disappear in the dryer ?
That ’s Bertha Lewis again .
2nd- @ Paul L.
Your criticism presents as much horse - pucky as O'Keefe 's propaganda tapes .
Vera made his calls immediately , and I 'm sorry to tell you that there 's nothing which can change that .
Furthermore , in true BigGov.com fashion , youre taking a lice comb to Maddow ’s report in order to tease out something you can mangle into an example of misinformation .
But in doing so , you completely miss the point that the entire subject is one not just of misinformation , but of slander , libel , and falsely representing evidence of criminal behavior .
Look , Vera called the police , he did the right thing , and he was acting on behalf of the pretty intense story of human suffering which Giles and O’Keefe completely left out of their posted tapes .
Despite that , Vera was falsely portrayed by O’keefe as a lecherous pervert hungry for young prey .
THAT TWISTING OF FACTS IS WHAT IS SIGNIFICANT HERE !!!
You probably do n’t know this , but that ’s the kind of thing that Inquisitors and witch - hunters used to do ... splice together bits of a persons words in order to paint that person as a satanist ( usually one who murdered children or cattle . )
O’Keefe ’s technique is as archaic as the hatred which motivates it .
Look , Breitbart always whines that the worst thing to accuse someone of in today ’s America is racism .
He always rants and raves about how O’Keefe is accused of racism , and how thats just the worst thing you can call someone .
But that ’s not true at all ... there are far worse things you can accuse someone of , even more than the disgusting trait of racism .
As someone who takes public trans , I hear racist crap every day .
It disgusts me , but like most other commuters , I choose to ignore such expressions in order not to feed the anger that inspires it .
But I know that I , and almost every other commuter would react very differently if someone was talking about how much he liked smuggling children for prostitution .
I think I and EVERYONE ELSE would freak out .
You know why ?
Because that idea is just SO incredibly horrifying .
My point is that to accuse someone of being a child - trafficking pedophile is FAR FAR FAR more damaging that accusing someone of racism .
You can walk away from a racist , but you always try to get pedophiles out of your neighborhood .
Breitbart , Giles and O’Keefe have all falsely accused the workers at ACORN of being child traffickers , and have labeled their ensemble the “ ACORN Child Prostitution Sting ” .
That ’s a VERY heavy accusation ... one so serious that , if you are making it , it had better be true .
They are accusing innocent people of a crime that ranks as the most heinous by almost all cultural standards .
But Breitbart has the nerve to throw a tantrum over being called the racist that he is .
What a shmuck !
And lets not forget that they have wasted the time of law enforcement officers whose primary concern is REAL crimes ( not ones made - up by a delusional bigot and habitual liar . )
Because of O’keefe , real criminals have a little less heat to worry about .
For Shame !

There is an extremely important detail left out of your post .
Please tell us what specific , unedited video was finally shown to prove the ACORN employees had been set up by severe editing ?
Surely Maddow's 12 minute report had lots of scenes that have never been seen .
And those scenes , which had been SEVERLY EDITED out of the O'Keefe videos have lots of exculpatory evidence .
So , please , tell us .
What was left out of O'Keefe 's videos ?
It seems you have been spending months demanding the unedited , full videos to be released .
Now they have been for the San Diego office .
What was in the unedited videos that exonerate Mr. Vera ?
Also , have you been able to find anything in the unedited videos that are differ from the full audio and transcript that have been available since September at Big Government ?
I look forward to your reply .

@larry - have you not read brads many posts on the edited tapes ?
just by piecing together what Okeefe chose to give out , his lying was already exposed .
And the fact that all these AGs keep finding no criminality when they look at the raw tapes ?...
If you believe OKeefes lies , criminal acts were committed , and AGs would be arresting folks .
Brad has had many other previous posts going into way more details than OKeefe has ever bothered in defending his characterization of this story .
This post was primarily noting Maddow 's coverage , not going over new information thoroughly .
And why does Brad , who has been way more thorough about this than anyone else ( except maybe the AG laywer staffs that got to see the raw tapes ) why does Brad have to have all the info in every post with every detail backing up any claim every made , and yet Okeefe was blasted all over MSM with no questions ?
These were big media orgs who within a day or two could have easily interviewed other witnesses to the events , talked to the several police depts that were called by Acorn after these idiots showed up , talked to the Acorn employees , reviewed the edited tapes thoroughly etc ..
But Brad is the inaccurate one ?!?... whatever .
Also , think about the question I have raised here before , again : even if Acorn employees were just as OKeefe presented them ( they were not , but go ahead a cling to an unfactual story ) , why did n't OKeefe make the unedited and raw tapes available , at least to journalists , from the beginning ?
Certainly Okeefe in presenting , and media in their " reporting " , could / would have highlighted the worst moments most interesting / shocking moments in their coverage , but if you have nothing to hide and your reporting is correct and consistent with the facts on the ground , you can post the whole interview tapes somewhere as reference material , you have no reason to withold once you have done your story .
There were no secret sources to protect , OKeefe and Giles were very open about who they were , very public with their images , the Acorn employees were already shown also , so no reason to hold back access raw material , that is except if you are engaged in deception .
So Okeefe 's own actions are not consistent with your defense of him / his story .
But hey , either your paid to post or you seem unable to wrap your mind around the fact Acorn and its employees may have been / acted at least slightly different than how they were portrayed .
So , because you are so resistent to facts , lets just set aside that issue for a moment and I ask you to think about how you are being manipulated into hating something , seeing something as evil incarnate by looking at this another way .
Let 's just say everything in regards to Acorn is just as it appears from Okeefe / Fox 's presentation ( its not , but I play a silly game for your sake ) .
So a few Acorn employees would be in jail by now .
Even if that was true and had happened ... does that make Acorn more criminal than any other Fed funded org or org in general ?
I
If we could secretly video interviews and actions of many Blackwater employees , you think none of them would every be caught in illegalities ?
We know some have committed crimes , even without secret videos made in disguise .
What about your local police force , not ever any bad or corrupt cops ?
As far as I 've seen in the last 20 years , there has been some significant corruption or illegalities of at least some of the cops of every major city ' police force .
Often they steal drugs , shake down drug dealers , take bribes , sexual assualt women etc ..... the FBI just caught some Mpls cops in my local area for taking bribes they set up .
How about if we secretly taped WalMart employees , would some of them go for child trafficking and meth dealing , tax evasion ?
Have no WalMart employees been arrested for such activities ?
What about Congress , it has many of its members busted for corruption , on both sides of the aisle , some with damning video tape .
What about the NHL , NFL etc ...
So just about any organization you can think of has some proven , convicted criminals in its ranks and so it stands to reason if you present people in any org with a fake story of crime , some of the employees might go along with it , as we already know , some of their employees have been criminals in the past .
So then the question is how endemic , pervasive is the criminality , and how high - up does the corruption go .
If a few cops are caught taking bribes , is everyone doing that or is it just these bad apples ?
Are the supervising cops aware of the corruption and allowing to persist , or worse yet , encouraging it .
Is the police chief in on it ?
What about Blackwater employees engaged in prostitution , drugs , gun running , rape ?
Does this go all the way up , or is it just a few bad apples in the org who did bad when they had opportunity in anarchic situations ?
Election security researchers decided to get an idea of how easy it might be to rig an election .
They offered bribes to election staff , and found several that were willing to do something illegal for a few hundred dollars .
So if we had video of bad cops , bad Walmart employees , bad Balckwater employees , bad Congress - people , bad election workers ... would n't the typical questions be , Have these staff / people commiteed crimes as its seems on tape ? ,
How deep / high up is this corruption ? ,
Who knew what / when ?
Is it a culture of corruption or is just a few bad apples ?
As I can see in the case of local police force , Blackwater , Walmart , proven illegality of their employees is generally not assumed to be a reflection of whole org unless widespread corruption is proven .
People generaly do not call for defunding entire orgs because some employees are convicted of crimes .
If corruption and criminality was so widespread in Acorn , than prove it , just like they do for police corruption , like they did in KY for election corruption , like they did with Congress and Abscam etc. .
And yet , when OKeefe 's so truthfully presented tapes of the soooo corrupt Acorn are shown to AGs , not even one employee , let along whole chapters or the whole org , is found to have committed a crime .
And yet Acorn no logner exists .
And if we are evaluating corruption of Acorn as a whole , ( even if we pretend OKeefe was so right in his portrayal of the employees he taped ) what of the actions of Acorn in total ?
That is the question we should be asking , as we do with other orgs .
So , how many secret recording visits did OKeefe do ?
How many resulted in the police being called by Acorn employees .
How many resulted in no interesting video , no unethical action ?
How many showed leadership higher up than staff level employees engage in wrong beahvior , organized corruption ?
We know some Acorn employees did call the police after OKeefe visits , so at most some ( what precentage we do not know ) employees acted well and some acted bad ( if we believe OKeefe as you seem intent on doing ) .
And remember , for this excerise I am conceding OKeefe did not trick and decive but presented rightly , which we know is also not true .
But even if it was , your vilification of Acorn does not hold up consistently with treatment of orgs found to have bad / criminal employees .
The reason you think Acorn is so bad is because there are some powerful people that want you to think they are bad and are working the media to spread that image .
There are many bad orgs out there with criminal employees and high - up corruption , but those are not exposed , or a few employees caught in corruption are arrested and go quietly into the night while their org lives on ... Just as we had to lose so many lives to take out the bad man Saddam , but the bad man who enslave women in Saudi Arabia or the bad man that tyrannizes his whole coutnry in No Korea , we hear little in media about them , we do not get images eeryday telling us how horrible they are and how necessary it is for us to take them out even though the demonstably do at least as much harm to their people as Saddam .
Be very wary when somone defines your bogeymen and enemies for you ... likely they are distracting you from them , your real enemy .

I 'm glad you like Brad 's thorough coverage of this topic .
But , there is no way he could have written about what was left out of the edited tapes in past posts since he has not seen them and he does not trust the complete transcripts that have been made available .
But , my point , which you neglected to address , was the fact that Maddow , and Brad 's headline , trumpet the notion of : " NOW WE'RE GOING TO SHOW YOU THE UNEDITED VIDEO TO PROVE O'KEEFE LIED " and yet , Maddow only showed 30 seconds of Mr. Vera that had been edited out .
That 30 second clip included an edit which left our 17 minutes of footage .
And , that 30 seconds did nothing to " prove " that Mr. Vera did nothing wrong .
You are also wrong about the AG 's report and the Brooklyn DA 's report .
The B'klyn DA 's office merely said that the grand jury did not bring an indictment .
There were reports of an anonymous source within the DA 's office who claimed the video that was edited out was exculpatory , but no specifics were provided .
The California AG 's report said that they could not bring charges of aiding and abetting against the employees because ultimately O'Keefe and Giles were not actually a pimp and a prostitute , they merely pretended to be .
Therefore , if there was no underlying crime , then the ACORN employees could not have been guilty of aiding and abetting .
You can not aid and abet playacting .
Have you READ the AG 's report , or are you merely relying on Brad and Maddow for your information ?
I suggest you look at the actual source , and read some web pages from the conservative angle as well as Brad 's then you can reach a well - rounded and fully informed opinion .
You might even enjoy it .
I write for a conservative leaning site , but I really enjoy reading Brad and HuffPo and Salon and Media Matters .
It helps provide me with a fuller picture of the truth .
I suggest you do the same .

And , while you are asking Brad for a new post , ask him to provide in this post , which is headlined " Maddow airs unedited ACORN videos " an example of unedited video from the San Diego sting that Maddow aired which actually proves O'Keefe left things out that would have exonerated Mr. Vera 's behavior .
By the way , it is incredibly insulting and arrogant to suggest that the only reason someone would disagree with your position is if they were " paid to post " .
Are you so close - minded that you can not make room for a person to look at the same information you are looking at and honestly reach a different conclusion ?
That is the kind of statement that gives people on your side of this debate an appearance of intolerance .
I am an average citizen , just like you .
I have a different opinion .
Nothing in my posts have been derogatory about you or Brad or Maddow .
I am asking simple questions which challenge the premise of Brad 's post and what he is trying to convey to his readers .
His thesis here is that O'Keefe SEVERELY EDITED his tapes to make the ACORN employees look bad .
If we could just see the unedited tapes , everyone would see the truth .
So , now the San Diego tapes have been seen and Maddow made a huge deal out of telling her audience that the tapes exonerated Mr. Vera .
and Brad repeated that claim in this post , So , now I ask , again :
What part of the unedited tapes were shown that exonerates Mr. Vera 's behavior ?
ANSWER : None .
Otherwise , Maddow would have shown it .
She did not .
READ the AG report .
What exonerates the ACORN employees is the fact that O'Keefe and Giles were acting instead of really doing the things they were claiming .
But , that 's not as sexy a headline because it does n't slam O'Keefe or Breitbart ... so , Brad spun the story a different way so he could attack O'Keefe and Breitbart .
Consider yourself better informed ow .
Your Welcome .

Larry , Larry , Quit Contrary , How does your love for lies grow ?
Going from the unedited footage , to the fallacious and libelous claim that there is an actual case for “ ACORN Child Prostitution Smuggling ” ( as the San Diego video is clumsily titled ) represents not just a leap ... , it ’s a BOLD FACED LIE advanced with the sole intention of damaging the people who are mis-represented on the videos .
THAT’S CALLED A LIE , LARRY , .... YOU SHOULD HAVE LEARNED THAT IN 3rd GRADE !!!
And yes , the unedited videos make that ABUNDANTLY clear .
The fact that all this has to be explained ( again ) for the benefit of the likes of Larry O’Conner is absolutely pathetic .
Larry , if you cant figure these things out with your own human senses , then you really are way too feeble to have this discussion , let alone have access to a computer .
Sorry pal , but you should start trying to get used to the truth .
Its part of maturing .
Suffice to say this – O'Keefe edited out the REALLY PAINFUL STORY OF HUMAN SUFFERING which he had orchestrated for Vera , and for other ACORN workers .
Some of that story might be on the transcripts , but its not on the HEAVILY EDITED videos which Okeefe posted , promoted on Fox , circulated on the internet , and submitted as explicit ( albeit false ) evidence of criminal activity .
That significant aspect of the recordings has had NO place in the narrative set up by the video producers , nor by their unquestioning followers , nor on the posted videos themselves , nor in the fallacious conclusions drawn from them .
That story totally changes the nature of what appears to be occurring on the posted video , AND YOU KNOW THAT , Larry ... do n’t play dumb for the sake of maintaining this nonsense .
The question posed by this fact is one that has been repeated quite a few times ... and one which was offered quite pointedly by Mike Stark ( a real journalist with real integrity ) at last year ’s National Press Club meeting .
Incidently , it is also a question which Breitbart , Giles and Okeefe have all consistently REFUSED to answer by playing a very cowardly and transparent game of “ hot potato ” ... and it continues to be one which they refuse to answer with equal cowardice and dishonesty .
But being caught off - guard by Stark last year had really upset Breitbart ( quite noticeably , ) and his people want to make sure that it doesnt happen again ... hence , Larry ’s redundant and moot questions .
O’Conner ’s posture echos the utter absurdity represented in the hurried equivocation of O’Keefe ’s pimp garb by his unquestioning followers .
For example , most of O’keefe ’s crowd are now circulating the lie ( six months after the fact ) that O’keefe “ never claimed to dress like a pimp in the ACORN offices . ”
They faithfully defer to Hannah ’s “ b- role ” line of BS ( again , SIX MONTHS after the fact . )
They now claim that it was the media who “ speculated ” that O’keefe dressed as a pimp , and that he had nothing to do with that impression .
This is not just a despicable lie ( one verifiable as such ) , it also shows how easily the BigGov crew can twist the very events which we have all lived through , and which occurred only a few months back .
And it shows how comfortable they are with that degree of cognitive dissonance .
This assault on living memory is one that which I consider very scary and dangerous ... it is a willful dismissal of fact in favor of baseless ideology and unsubstantiated fabrications , steered towards political mud-slinging and slander ( shades of George W. , on that note . )
When this story first broke , O’Keefe was sitting with Fox and friends , and was introduced by the man who sat right in front of him as being “ dressed in the exact same ” costume that he wore to ACORN offices .
Okeefe was right in front of him when he said that .
He made NO effort ( for about 6 whole months ) to correct the false impression created by what Giles now calls “ a b- role clip ” ( in fact , he actively fed that impression . )
Nor did James make any attempt to correct the false impression created by selectively editing out the traumatic story so callously mocked by ho - bag Hannah Giles .
He seems more interested in grotesque pin-up pics of Hannah , then in telling THAT part of the story .
Apparently , when all this was being discussed , the “ investigative journalist ” in james must have been asleep at the wheel ...
He and Giles had SIX MONTHS to correct those false impressions .
They only corrected the former when called out on it ( six months later ) and remain completely silent regarding the latter .
Their silence speaks volumes .
James had SIX MONTHS to explain , with his own mouth , what the context he had established before he edited the videos ... he never has .
And folsk like Larry just choose to ignore that part of the story .
When James was asked if he was ever refused by an ACORN office , a reference to the story about helping abused and under - aged prostitutes flee an evil pimp would have been both appropriate AND NECESSARY ( that is , IF he were actually interested in the truth . )
He made a choice not to ( because , like you Larry , he is not interested in truth , he ’s interested in assault . )
AGAIN LARRY , THAT’S CALLED LYING , .... AGAIN , YOU SHOULD HAVE LEARNED THAT IN 3rd GRADE !!!
Now the suckers that trail after BigGov.com act as if james is being blamed for something he never did .
Again , that ’s just pathetic .
Even by comparison with O'keefe 's own transcripts , his posted videos lie ... not only that , they falsely accuse Vera of an EXTREMELY heinous crime ( one far worse than the accusations of racism which Breitbart is always crying about ) , and have ruined the man ’s life because of that .
The data from the LA office is even more incriminating for O’keefe , and I think we should just let Larry compare the unedited footage with the posted videos in order to work that one out for himself ( Really Lars , its not that hard , just pay attention .
Youre not a 2 year old , this doesnt have to be explained to you . )
You know , I dont want to answer too much from Larry 's questions , only because I know that the BigGov crew are trying to use a tactic of online reconnaissance in order to brainstorm for O'keefe 's defense .
They want to see what cards O'keefe 's critics have on the table so that he wont be taken by surprise like he was during last year ’s National Press Club meeting ( let alone in a court of law . )
Like it or not , Laurence , there is room for honesty here , and its high time your pals stepped up to that standard .

For The Benefit of Larry O'Conner , whose physical eye 's seem to have the same filters as James Okeefe 's own " Final Cut Express " equipment --- ( from the conclusions to AG Browns report , emphasized and spaced by moi )
" The edited O’Keefe videos released on the BigGovernment.com website portrayed ACORN as an organization infested with employees committing crimes .
However , the impression of rampant illegal conduct created by the recordings at the various ACORN offices around the country is not supported by the evidence related to the videos in California .
Our investigation revealed facts which were not reflected in the recordings .
The San Diego employee ’s answers were influenced by his limited English and intent to contact the police .
The San Bernardino ACORN receptionist knew it to be a prank and made outrageous and false statements .
O’Keefe stated he was out to make a point and to damage ACORN and therefore did not act as a journalist objectively reporting a story .
The video releases were heavily edited to feature only the worst or most inappropriate statements of the various ACORN employees and to omit some of the most salient statements by O’Keefe and Giles .
Each of the ACORN employees recorded in California was a low level employee whose job was to help the needy individuals who walked in the door seeking assistance .
Giles and O’Keefe lied to engender compassion , but then edited their statements from the released videos .
Would it have been best had each ACORN employee simply refused to deal with the couple and shown them the door when their story came out ?
Of course .
ACORN was not the criminal enterprise described by O’Keefe in his “ Chaos for Glory ” statement – it did not receive billions in federal funds and did not control elections .
( btw , Lars , these last three examples point out verifiable lies ) ACORN is , however , disorganized and its operations were far from transparent , leaving it vulnerable to allegations of illegal activity and misuse of funds .
Many of the ACORN employees lacked appropriate training and ACORN did not comply with its own internal policies and procedures . "
Of course , AG Brown does go on to fault ACORN for its own mis-deeds and short - comings ... but those short - comings arent what OKeefe is addressing .
Okeefe is addressing a lie which he fabricated , and which he collaged out of sound - bytes .
Sure , a habitual liar as sociopathic and self - contradictory as Andrew Breitbart would find that entirely natural ... but real adults react otherwise .
Face it Laurence , Okeefe , Breitbart and Giles are about as helpful to modern conservatism as Stephen Fincher or Dale Robertson .

... Brad Friedman said on 4/11/2010 @ 2:25 pm PT ...
Larry O'Connor ( who works for Andrew Breitbart ) shamelessly mislead and / or lied in various comments above :
So , please , tell us .
What was left out of O'Keefe 's videos ?
There is no need to .
It has already been documented in the CA Attorney General 's 28 page report [ PDF ] , and 55 pages of supporting documentation , and hours of previously unreleased video tape .
You know , the stuff you shamelessly mischaracterized and / or lied about when you recently wrote your own self - discrediting post about it all at Andrew Breitbart 's " Andrew Breitbart Presents Big Journalism " sham webiste .
Happily SreeBee has been decent enough , however , to share with you just some of the information from that report which you failed to share with your misinformed and disinformed readers over there , before we had to waste too much time in doing so .
But here 's just a few more points ( but by no means all ) from the AG 's summarized look at what was n't in each of the severely edited videos ( beginning on p. 11 of his report ) , as released in the illegal California video and audio tapings illicitly made by Giles and O'Keefe and published by your boss Andrew Breitbart :
The released recordings did not include all Giles ’ statements regarding the abusive pimp , her tragic life , and fear for the underage girls , or Stewart ’s statements that ACORN could not help .
...
He also released an edited audiotape of the conversation with Miller but did not explain that Miller was not an ACORN employee .
The deceptively edited versions of the videos also failed to show employees repeated assertions that ACORN could not help the pair , employees urging Giles to find a different line of work , or seek counseling as a tortured abuse victim .
Just some of the additional information from the AG 's report which you also dishonestly withheld from your mess of a " Big Journalism " article and its readers when you made your false charge that the only reason there were no crimes committed was because O'Keefe and Giles were n't actually a pimp or prostitute : Even if OKeefe and Giles had truly intended to break the law , there is no evidence that any of the ACORN employees had the intent to aid and abet such criminal conduct or agreed to join in that illegal conduct .
...
Additionally , there is no evidence that any of the California ACORN employees did any act to further or promote any of the criminal activity discussed with O’Keefe and Giles .
... ACORN employees did not commit any crime in advising O’Keefe and Giles to report and pay taxes on income earned from criminal activity because income taxes apply to both legal and illegal activities .
I could , of course , continue to waste much more of my time in showing the disinformation you posted at Andy 's site is deceptive itself , but you --- like your fellow Breitbart Tea Bag Boyz Ben Shapiro , L.A. County Deputy D.A. Patrick " Patterico " Frey , and fellow stooge / commenter DaleyRocks --- are not serious critics , not serious people , and are little more than propagandists , clowns , dirty trickster , ratfuckers and liars in the mold of covert CIA asset - outer Karl Rove , Watergate burglar G. Gordon Liddy , and arms for Iranian hostages law - breaker Oliver North .
In short :
You , like they , are an unscrupulous joke and an unapologetic partisan propagandist --- and sadly , one who has no compunction about undermining democracy , the Rule of Law or the Constitution in order to ply that sick , immoral trade in which your fellow citizens --- some of those who can least afford such assaults --- pay the greatest price for your political ambitions and ideology .
You are welcome to do so , just not at my website , where you have also now violated the " knowing disinformation " rule which you and your Tea Bag Boyz just can't seem to help but ignore .
Just one or two more points , and then I 'll go back to being done with your disingenuous jackassery .
You further wrote , misleadingly :
The California AG 's report said that they could not bring charges of aiding and abetting against the employees because ultimately O'Keefe and Giles were not actually a pimp and a prostitute , they merely pretended to be .
Therefore , if there was no underlying crime , then the ACORN employees could not have been guilty of aiding and abetting .
You can not aid and abet playacting .
Yes , it did say that .
It also said much more .
Some of which I 've quoted above to you , none of which you 've bothered to share with your misinformed and disinformed readers at Breitbart 's propaganda site .
You then deceptively wrote : I suggest you look at the actual source , and read some web pages from the conservative angle as well as Brad 's then you can reach a well - rounded and fully informed opinion .
Can you recommend any " web pages from the conservative angle " in addition to mine ?
Because my interpretation of the Rule of Law has been consistent , from day one , with real conservatism , versus the deceptive , America - hating Republicanism that you and your fellow hoaxsters preach .
I write for a conservative leaning site , but I really enjoy reading Brad and HuffPo and Salon and Media Matters .
It helps provide me with a fuller picture of the truth .
I suggest you do the same .
No , you do not " write for a conservative leaning site " .
You write for Andrew Breitbart 's various Rightwing Republicanist sites .
There is nothing " conservative " about those sites , else you 'd see them calling for the Rule of Law to be respected , the U.S. Constitution to be followed , accountability for those who violated both of the above , and the fight for democracy of the people , by the people and for the people inherent in both .
You would n't know " conservatism " if it bit you on the ass , Larry .
And , by the way , it has .
When you decide to join me in the fight for true conservatism , please let me know , I 'll be happy to remove you from the moderated commenters list at that time .
Perhaps I 'll even call off my " Larry O'Connor Pedophilia Investigation " at the same time if it turns out you can prove your innocence against the overwhelming evidence compiled so far .

@ Larry , Oh , Stop it Lars , no one is attacking you , just the nonsense that you ’re peddling ( and it IS complete and utter non-sense . )
If you cant take the heat , stay out of the kitchen .
1st -
If you have a problem with the known and accepted variations on your name , take it up with your parents , not with me .
2nd-
The behavior of Mr. Vera and of ALL the other ACORN members on the videos is entirely exonerated by the story which Giles had told them about needing to RESCUE underage prostitutes , okay ?
They are exonerated by the VERY TRAGIC story which Hannah had fabricated about escaping abuse and trying to help others do so ( and which , interestingly enough , has had NO place in the posted videos nor in the subsequent conclusions which the BigGov , the RNC , CPAC etc ... had developed from them . )
Believe it or not Laurence , but that story which Hannah told DOES resonate with people involved in urban relief .
This may be a shocker to you , but there are a LOT of women who need to escape the nightmare which Hannah is mocking in her attack on ACORN .
Try going to your own church ’s own charity ( if it has one ) and see how many homeless women ( and men ) are fleeing abuse , and trying to find safe places to live , and who ( sadly ) need to sell themselves just to get some food .
I know that world might not seem real to you ... and it shouldnt be real for anyone .
But it DOES exist , and people involved in urban relief are ABSOLUTELY beholden to helping people in that scene , whether you or Crazy old Andy like it or not .
And Lars , if you dare to step away from your blogs , and venture outside your comfort zone , you might discover how painfully real that world is .
You might just grow a little bit if you tried to understand what actually happens in many inner-city ghettos , or why feminists mobilize against the violence inflicted on women .
Nevertheless , in the unedited videos , Hannah explicitly expresses fear for her life , and those of her younger companions .
THAT is edited out of the tapes .
THAT , AMONG SO MUCH ELSE MAKES THE VIDEOS A LIE !
QUIT KIDDING YOURSELF , OKAY ?
And if parts of Hannah ’s story are referenced in the transcripts , then that means that what Mike Stark had said last year was ABSOLUTELY TRUE , and the videos do n’t even stand up to their own transcripts .
Also , Mr. Vera 's behavior is exonerated by his contact with the police ... a fact that Giles and Okeefe have NEVER MENTIONED FOR THE LAST 6 MONTHS ( and continue to never mention ) while simultaneously accusing him of being a pervert and a child - molester .
That accusation IS A LIE !
They know it , and so do you .
What 's so hard to understand about this ?
This is ridiculous ...
I am starting to believe that you are the same guy that was trolling Max Blumenthal at CPAC muttering the word “ rubric " like it was going out of style .
You ask the same questions over and over , but you refuse to acknowledge the answers .
And on this one , you are really fighting an up - hill battle , deary .
The evidence is stacked against Okeefe ... nothing you or he can say will change that until O’Keefe explains why he deliberately left out the story about “ Kenya ’s ” life from the videos , or from any interview about his experiences at ACORN .
The burden of proof is on James , and he'd better quit playing the games which he has been , and which you are only too happy ( or too immature ) to accomodate .
Again , watch the videos , and read the report ... ESPECIALLY the portion cited above .
3rd--
You have an ample selection of very reasonable answers to your questions .
If you choose to pretend that you dont understand them , then get some help .
This is just an observation , not an attack .

If young Lars is in the employ of Breitbart , then no amount of hard evidence , plain logic or clear reasoning will penetrate that rock - hard shell .
These guys hard - wire deniablity right into their own programming ( eg Hannah Giles - - " Above all , attack ! attack !
Attack !
Never defend " .... it ’s a brain - dead fanatic 's way of saying " never , ever be accountable ! " )
Also Larry , if you are in the employ of Breitbart , then NOBODY owes you an explanation , here or ANYWHERE !!!
On the contrary Laurence , YOU need to do the explaining .
Your boss needs to do the explaining .
James and hoe - bag Hannah need to do the expalining .
Since you are actively participating in libel , disinformation and slander , you dont deserve the courtesy of an explanation .
You should be thoroughly ashamed for your own contributions to a unjust campaign of deceit and cruelty .
And you have some nerve assuming that people answer your contradictory , redundant and pointlessly idiotic demands .
YOU need to do the explaining !
Why did your boy edit out the story about the traumatic life of " Kenya " ( " Eden " , or whatever ) , or her concern for the safety of her underage charges ?
WHY was that taken out of his posted tapes ?
Why didnt he ever bring it up in his interviews , or answer AT ALL when the question was posed to him ?
What purpose did that serve ?
Why hasnt James or Hannah updated any of their slanders and smears about the people in their tapes ?
Why no caveats explaining what they got wrong ?
Other people have corrected their work as per the grievances of a scumbag like James ... why cant he do the same for Juan Carlos Vera ?
Has BigGov retracted Hannah 's description of Tresa as a " murderer ? "
Has O’Keefe changed the name of his tapes from “ ACORN Child Prostitution Smuggling ” ?
For shame !

" Your attack on me seems histrionic " ?
This IS the " rubric " guy , isnt it ?
I got a fresh 10 dollar whopper for ya Lars ...
" disingenuous " ... look it up !
Lets consider the net effect of the work which you , those unfeeling , toe - headed kids and your blowhard boss have all engaged in .
It has been to force public policy on the basis of un-vetted internet video which was heavily edited by a very shady individual who already has been witnessed doctoring footage to meet his agenda ( and thank you , Liz Farkas . )
That ’s pretty freakin’ Mediaeval .
Orwell could n’t have imagined a better MiniTrue tactic himself .
Additionally , your crew has slandered innocent people with some extremely disturbing accusations , all of which have proven to be fabricated by James , Hannah and trusty ol ’ “ Final Cut Express ” .
You also contribute to a web - complex which continues to post what has already proven to be very cruel and hair - raising LIES about real people ( eg , that Tresa is a “ murderer ” , that Juan Carlos is a perverted old lech hungry for kids , that Stewart was coxing Hannah to set up a brothel , that there is even any evidence for “ ACORN Child Prostitution Smuggling ” , etc . .. )
Does that ever get to you at all ?!?!
I mean , do n’t you have anything remotely resembling a conscience ?
Your boss has had plenty of opportunities to offer retractions , corrections , addenda , even an apology for slandering people in such a hideously malicious way , but he never has .
Okeefe has had plenty of opportunities to explain why he edited the tapes the way he did , and he never has .
And what they both continue to promote , with a little help from you , has already proven to be lies .
Get real , Lars ... , you do n’t deserve any explanation .
YOU still have to be accountable for your own participation in this campaign of deception .
People have answered your questions more than enough , and you just do n’t seem to want to acknowledge it .
But now its your turn .
Now YOU have to answer why , for instance , O’Keefe decided to edit out their terrible mockery of human suffering which he and Hannah introduced to the ACORN members on the tapes .
You have to explain its absence from his own spoken synopsis of the encounters .
Do n’t try to tip the question elsewhere , the burden of proof is on your boy , not on anyone else .
If my tone has seemed too strong in my dealings with Lawrence , then I sincerely apologize to Brad and all the other readers on this blog .
But Lars baby , if you work for Breitbart , then you do n’t deserve any of the courtesies which your boss and his delinquent charges so callously withheld from their targets .
I 'm done with you Lawrence ... we 're breaking up .
But do take my advice above ( # 27 ) and try to see what things are like in a homeless shelter .
I mean , you might as well know what you are trying to condemn so many people to through the libelous assaults that your boy makes on places like ACORN , HUD etc ...

Dear Brad ,

You do n't consider that censorship ?
And , could you please let me know why you feel it is necessary to taunt and call people names ?
" Andy " , " Crazy Andy " , " Tea Bag Boyz " , " Stooge " , " Patty " ...
Is this your attempt at elevating the debate in our society ?
Also , have you found the one piece of unedited video in Maddow 's report that shows a different story than the edited tapes O'Keefe released ?
Still waiting .
Given the headline of this post and the entire thrust of this post ( other than you pointing out that you did not get credit on MSNBC ) .
I would think that actual video footage in the Maddow report that actually shows that the O'Keefe edited videos misrepresented the truth would be pertinent .
Now , I beg you and / or any one of your readers to answer this point without using the AG report and without calling anyone names or being patronizing .
It is a simple question :
What video was shown in the Maddow report , that had been edited out of the O'Keefe videos , that proves the O'Keefe videos were misleading ?
If there is n't any , would it not call into question the implication in your headline and your post ?
Is n't that why you have not been able to answer the question ?
It seems like it should be quite simple .

I ask what was in the Maddow report and you point me to the CA AG report .
Now , I understand these questions can be confusing , but please point me to what was shown IN THE MADDOW REPORT .
I KNOW what is in the CA AG report .
I am not asking about the CA AG report .
Your headline implies that Maddow showed unedited video which proved the ACORN story was ' fuleled by pure manure ' .
So , WHAT WAS SHOWN IN THE MADDOW REPORT THAT PROVES THAT STATEMENT ?
Finally with regard to you calling me a liar ( which is , again , contemptible and not at all in keeping with the more civilized tone I continue to attempt to maintain with you ) .
You claim this sentence is a lie : " You said that I was guilty of breaking " knowing disinformation " rule of your website , I am no longer welcome to post here "
And yet , you say in comment # 26 : " You are welcome to do so , just not at my website , where you have also now violated the " knowing disinformation " rule which you and your Tea Bag Boyz just can't seem to help but ignore . " and then you placed me on your dreaded " moderated comments " list .

34 Breitbart offered to show them to Boehlert ?
Why not just release them publicly from the get go instead of waiting months until the damage was already done ?
I think Breitbart knew the footage was edited to an agenda because O'Keefe 's agenda matches Breitbarts

Gary Eaton @ 32 asked : 1 . Are you censoring Larry 's posts , Brad ?
Not so far , though I retain the right to do so if he fails to follow the simple rules we have for commenting here respectfully at The BRAD BLOG ( none of which have anything to do with agreeing with me , or the content of this site btw , as you can see ) .
This is my private website after all .
Every word he has posted to this site has been made available for all to read , despite his whining and misleading to the contrary --- but that 's what he does apparently .
2 . You guys do know that Breitbart 's offered to show the unedited tapes , followed by a Q and A session .
Boehlert 's never responded .
Why ?
Why do n't you ask him ?
But I 'd tell you my answer , if you 're asking me .
It 's because real journalism is not an Andy Breitbart Side Show .
It 's not a performance .
If Breitbart , O'Keefe or Giles actually believed their hoax ACORN video tapes demonstrated any actual crimes , they would have released them in full for the world to see , so justice could be done .
Such as they were a scam from the jump , however , Breitbart decided to make a show out of it all instead .
He 's a coward and a liar and a con-artist who relies on the gullible nature of folks like yourself to buy into his bullshit , and folks like Larry O'Connor to pass it on unquestioningly to the public .
It all amounts to journalistic malpractice , and apparently neither Breitbart nor O'Keefe nor O'Connor nor any of the other patsy 's he 's fooled into buying into his nonsense seem to give a damn .
In short :
It 's a circus sideshow , not journalism .
Andy knows that .
Andy does n't care .
He also knows there are no crimes in those videos ( other than the ones carried out by O'Keefe and Giles ) , else he'd have released them .
If he tells you they do show crimes , then that means he 's withholding evidence of a crime .
3 . It 's too bad you ACORN defenders are so blinded by your ideology that you can't see the nose in front of your face .
I think that was n't a joke .
Which is sad for you , my friend .
Enjoy your world of delusion .
We 'll be back here in the Reality - Based World whenever and if ever you choose to come join us .

@ Gary Eaton # 32 , Okay , Gary , you are right ...
Breitbart has been totally honest from day 1 .
And of course , he has even offered the unedited tapes for public viewing ... .... it’s just the rest of us who refused to see them , that ’s all ... especially that damn Eric Boehlert , with his despicable lefty beard and his despicable liberal web- site , ... he refused to view it , ... how could that be Breitbart 's fault ?
Andrew 's been an absolute peach this whole time , right ?
Andrew NEVER tried to blackmail AG Holder , O’keefe NEVER wrote up a public refusal to accept an interview with CNN ON THE VERY DAY HE FIRST RELEASED HIS TAPES , and Breitbart NEVER authored an article celebrating the “ politicized art ” of his disingenuous video - release method .
They have always been open and transparent about their work , right ?
Completely above the table ?
But of course !
The unedited tapes were there for all and sundry to view , with a Q & A session to boot !
How could everybody just have missed that for the past 6 months ?
CURSE YOU ERIC BOEHLERT !!!
I am sure that AG Brown did n’t really need to offer James and Hannah immunity for access to the unedited tapes , because they and their boss never presented a consistent refusal to allow for such an unedited viewing ... , ( certainly not ... , that never happened at all ) , ... Brown was just being a dear , that ’s all .
Maybe its just that Brown likes the cut of O’Keefe ’s gib ?
Maybe that 's why he got immunity ?
The AG just might have a fetish for guys with that chinless , “ Granny Clampet ” thing going on .. because certainly , BigGov.com was utterly transparent this whole time .
So OF COURSE , Breitbart was offering the unedited footage for public view these past 6 months ...
He was always open about the facts , ... and we were greeted as Liberators , and Oceania has always been at war with Eurasia , right ?
Double plus good , eh? .... its just that ACORN , Bertha Lewis , Joan Walsh , AG Harshberger , CNN , Mike Stark , Media Matters , Brad Freidman , Katherine Conway Russel , Alexandra Fenwick , Carol Leonning , Dave Weigel , Mike Madden , ( even Greta Van Susteren and James Taranto ) and especially that “ despicable ” Eric Boehlert , have all just refused to look at that evidence which Andy put out there ...
None of them ever bothered to ask Breitbart to release the unedited tapes , and Andy has been forthright from the get go .
---Seriously , you know Gary , we have all seen what has transpired over the past 6 months .
Dont be convinced to dismiss what actually occured in living memory for the sake of a last minute ditch by that maestro of misinformation , Andrew Breitbart .

@ Larry , Please answer this :
Why is the tragic story of Kenya , and of the hair raising peril which she outlines for her younger charges , left out from the tapes ?
Why is it absent from O'keefe 's narrative of is visits ?
Why have you , your boss , or those irresponsible delinquents NEVER discussed that part of the story for the past 6 months ?
Why do you continue to avoid even acknowledging its existence in these exchanges ?
We have all answered your questions , even though ( as a professional liar ) you hardly deserve that all .
If you choose to ignore those answers , that ’s more of a reflection on you than on anything else .
And please drop the whole Polyanna bit , you do n’t wear it well at all .
...
You work for an organization that has actively slandered people with false accusations of VERY SERIOUS CRIMES ( the expression “ ACORN Child Prostitution Smuggling ” is not a light accusation ..
Its pretty serious by most standards . ) .
Your hands are filthy with the most grotesque indulgence in mud-slinging , and you continue to refuse accountability .
So you can loose the whole “ righteousness ” trip ... its no more convincing than Lame james excuses .
You and your crew remain as the sole actors who need to explain why you chose to malign others so recklessly , and with such paltry and unconvincing “ evidence ” .
Since you work for Breitbart , and you particiapted in his libelous agenda , you cant afford the luxury of being indignant about this .
You need to explain why your company forced public policy on the basis of grossly distorted “ evidence . ”
No body owes you anything .
The burden of proof is on you .

You claim this sentence is a lie : " You said that I was guilty of breaking " knowing disinformation " rule of your website , I am no longer welcome to post here "
And yet , you say in comment # 26 : " You are welcome to do so , just not at my website , where you have also now violated the " knowing disinformation " rule which you and your Tea Bag Boyz just can't seem to help but ignore . "
Actually , the full paragraph of Brad's which you quoted in part , is this :
In short :
You , like they , are an unscrupulous joke and an unapologetic partisan propagandist --- and sadly , one who has no compunction about undermining democracy , the Rule of Law or the Constitution in order to ply that sick , immoral trade in which your fellow citizens --- some of those who can least afford such assaults --- pay the greatest price for your political ambitions and ideology .
You are welcome to do so , just not at my website , where you have also now violated the " knowing disinformation " rule which you and your Tea Bag Boyz just can't seem to help but ignore .

Brad @ 34
Thanks so much for the kind words , and please know that I feel the same way about you and your work !
I am really glad you have created a forum to keep these guys accountable .
It ’s a pretty scary world when unvetted and doctored evidence can force public policy , the way O'Keefe misled congress ... but isnt that how W got the war in Iraq off the ground ?
Something about those boys from the Leadership Institute ... whether big ( Rove ) or small ( OKeefe ) , is there even an honest one among them ?
Breitbart 's crew evidences an almost robotic ability to distance themselves from their own actions , even their own words .
That is really quite remarkable ... and it would be entertaining if they werent so malicious and destructive .
But it is an absolutely maddening discussion , precisely because of that tendency so endemic to their behavior .
I mean , even as James recklessly edits his tapes for his agenda , his crew seems to have the ability to do the same with their own memories ... that ’s pretty freaky .
James ’ love for selective editing seems to reflect a culture of selective memories , selective vision , selective hearing etc ...
So thank you , Brad , for setting up a bulwark against the regression these folks want to actualize with such a hurried fever .

Larry @ 35 asks : " What was in the Maddow report ? "
After WATCHING the Maddow report , I can tell you !
According to Maddow ( with back - up from her video clips that show both edited and unedited versions ) : 1 . Pimp outfit Edited : Appeared as if O'Keefe & Giles were entering the San Diego office with him dressed in hat & fur coat .
Unedited : Showed shirtsleeve --- no coat .
Instead , dress shirt with pinstripes .
( NOT shown in edited version . )
2 . Human trafficking Edited : Showed Vera offering advice on smuggling in girls .
Unedited ( NOT shown in edited version ) : Showed Vera pushing Giles & O'Keefe for details and information .
Other material ( AG report ; video of Giles misquoting Vera ) show that Vera had no intention of helping Giles and O'Keefe , but wanted information to pass along to police .
3 . " You can do anything . "
Here Maddow reports on the differences between Fox 's editing of the videotape and the unedited version , NOT the difference between O'Keefe 's public version and the unedited version ( there is n't any difference for this particular clip ) .
FOX : LaVelle 's
" You can do anything " speech followed disclosure that Giles and O'Keefe wanted to start a prostitution business .
Unedited tape ( and released tape ) : LaVelle 's " You can do anything " speech followed disclosure that Giles and O'Keefe were being denied housing because Giles was a prostitute .
Hey , no problem Larry , glad to help .
I know it 's hard for some people to follow these things sometimes .

Larry O'Connor , Your question --- What part of the unedited tapes were shown on Maddow's 12 minute report that exonerates Mr. Vera 's behavior ?
The answer ---
Your question does n't make any sense .
When you look at the transcripts and tapes there is nothing to exonerate .
Your question only makes sense if one accepts the distorted representation of reality of O'Keefe 's highly edited video .
Apparently , you do .
We do n't .
Neither do any of the multiple investigations into this matter .
Your question does n't make any sense .
Even when you ask it repeatedly .
COMMENT # 46 [ Permalink ]
... Larry O'Connor said on 4/13/2010 @ 10:32 am PT ...
@Lora # 43 THANK YOU !
Finally someone directly answers a direct question .
1 . The video that Maddow claimed was unedited showing O'Keefe 's shirt sleeve ( thus proving he did not dress as a pimp in the office ) was actually NOT from the unedited video it was absolutely in the edited video that O'Keefe released last September .
Either Maddow was sloppy , or she purposely mis-informed , you decide .
But , what she did NOT include in her report was O'Keefe saying THIS in the unedited video : But , um , I met her and we sort of fell in love and I 'm trying to help her get set up
here with this with this sex business and maybe even one day I can take like a percentage a
percentage um like I dunno like 30 % or something financially from the from the house that
we 're running And :
The girls would be my primary source of income .
Does that suggest that maybe he was posing as a pimp regardless of his clothing ?
You decide .
2 . The clip you mention is a 30 second part of the unedited video which Maddow claims shows Vera " pressing and pressing and pressing " O'Keefe for details ( presumably to set him up for a police sting )
But , did you know that the 30 second clip she showed contained an edit ?
And that edit omitted 17 minutes of dialog that did not fit her agenda ?
So they edited it to make it appear that Vera was " pressing and pressing and pressing " for more information from O'Keefe .
But , here is a quote form O'Keefe on the video : I need to figure out like what , what things do you need um from , for our phone call tomorrow ?
What things do you need from me in terms of like the shipment information .
What can I give you , what information would you further need would help you in , in advice you would give me ?
Now , does it sound like O'Keefe needs to be " pressed " to give out information ?
You decide .
3 . I was really only focusing on the Vera segment .
I agree with you that this one is pretty innocuous .
I 'm surprised she did n't pull more out of the LA tapes .
There is more there that could have made her case .
I think Maddow 's producers did not serve her well at all .
Her report was full of holes .
It seemed they were more interested in making Fox look bad than they were in exposing truth behind the unedited video .
Honestly , I think Brad could have done a much better job .
That is why I quarrel with the notion that Maddow exposed anything with this report and with the unedited videos .
She really did n't in my opinion .
I hope Brad allows this comment to post in its entirety .
It is really the point I wanted to make , but only after his readers viewed the Maddow piece in its entirety and reached the conclusion that @ Lora did .
I also hope the readers acknowledge that I have attempted to offer a contrary perspective using the same facts that area available to anyone who wants to look for them and I have maintained a civil and respectful tone throughout this exchange .
If Brad posts this , I promise not to respond to any other feedback on this post .
Best ,
Larry

First of all Larry , that was all so entirely pointless .
I can believe you put up that much of a stink to make those really innocuous talking points .
Your whole argument has been that of a dog chasing its tail .
Congrats on finally biting down on the tip ... but you still havent proven anything , and you still have avoided the real substance of the issue at hand .

correction to the above ---- that should have been " I cant believe you put up that much of a stink to make those really innocuous talking points , etc . ... "
Not like it matters ...
Lars wont address the issue of Kenya 's tragic backgorund , or the potential rape that her charges faced .
or maybe theyre brainstorming a way out of that one ... who knows , they are all expert liars .
This is what is interesting about the BigGov style of analysis .
They focus on irrelevant minutiae with such a blast that they block out the real significant matters at hand .
Gary Eaton above is a perfect example ... in his world , it 's Eric Boehlert who is to be held accountable for not viewing the tapes , rather than Breitbart for withholding them .

Larry @ 46 , You 're welcome .
I can see you were waiting with bated breath to be able to answer me .
So , let 's see ...
The San Diego shirtsleeve .
I watched all the edited videos I could find very carefully several weeks ago , specifically to look for what O'Keefe was wearing .
My comment for the San Diego tape was " no shots of O'Keefe in office . "
So , unless you can back up your assertion that Maddow ( and I ) had it wrong , I call BS .
Now , the " sex business . "
Yes , I remember that .
That particular video was unusual , in that it was one of O'Keefe 's most blatant descriptions of what they were pretending to do .
He and Giles were still pretending to be boyfriend and girlfriend ; he was trying to set Hannah up in her own business ; and he was expecting to sponge off Hannah indefinitely .
Hannah was to be in charge of the business , not him .
He made Giles out to be more like a pimp than he himself was in that video .
Now for the " pressing , pressing " part .
Maddow shows the clip in which O'Keefe asks what information Vera needs .
So 17 minutes goes by ( what was in that 17 minutes , anyway ? ) and Vera is STILL asking for phone numbers , dates , etc ...???
Sounds like " pressing " to me .
Here 's my question to you , Larry : What " holes " that you can provide back - up for did Maddow have ?
Oh , wait ....
" If Brad posts this , I promise not to respond to any other feedback on this post . "
Awww , I guess we will never find out .
In closing , I say that Brad did a fine job , and Maddow 's report did what it set out to do : showed that O'Keefe and Giles presented a heavily slanted picture of ACORN that exaggerated and lied about their own pretense and about the way ACORN and ACORN housing reps responded to them .
And Larry has not yet shown any " holes " in Maddow 's report .

But it did n't keep him from writing about it at Breitbart 's site with enough words that Andy 's tea bag boyz would beleive that he did ( usually a descriptive headline is enough to satisfy the " journalistic " curiosity and " integrity " of that bunch . )
I 'm afraid our dear Larry does n't seem to have ever had an idea that his boss Andy Breitbart did n't have first .
His Twitter feed ( @ Stage_Right ) is a must read if you 're wondering what 's on Andy 's mind / agenda at any given time .

Does he really expect with time constraints on a show to show the full unedited tapes on air ?
Maddow expects her viewers to actually go and watch the tapes for herself .
Again Larry gets it wrong .
You obviously have no idea what a pimp actually does .
By his very definition anytime a husband is a stay at home dad and his wife works and he supports himself off her income he's not a mooch but instead a pimp .
Mooching off of your girlfriends money does not make one a pimp .
Only a blockhead would think that .

Before this thread drops below the fold … and so I can sleep tonight …
I have to address Larry ’s attempts again to discredit ACORN via Rachel Maddow at Breitbart ’s site ( Thanks to Brad @ 50 for the link ) .
( Transcript links are on Larry ’s article at Breitbart ’s site , linked by Brad @ 50 ) .
( Emphasis is mine throughout . )
The SHIRTSLEEVE : “ Edited vs. Unedited ” True , Larry was right : at the end of the Edited video is a glimpse of the shirtsleeve , same as in the Unedited video .
BUT : in the Edited video , when the shirtsleeve was seen as O’Keefe was walking out of the building , the music was playing and it was shown as part of a montage – as in “ B - roll , ” with other clips that were not part of the interview at all !
Something Larry did NOT bother to disclose !
“ Pressing , pressing , pressing … ” Larry correctly describes Maddow playing an exchange in which O’Keefe was asking Vera what information he needed to help with transporting underage girls .
When Maddow then plays a clip showing VERA pressing for information about a phone number from O’Keefe , Larry calls foul because the phone number clip happened earlier in the video .
Larry writes that Maddow “ tells her audience that O’Keefe purposely left out an important portion of this exchange , in which Vera asks O’Keefe for his phone number .
“ Um , FALSE .
Maddow did NOT say that .
She says : “ Actually , what you do n’t see in that Fox news report , is the rest of the video … ” … which includes Vera asking about the phone number .

The study says , Men are more likely to have sex and enjoy their sex than women .
The new scientific research , said that people who stay active and healthy can enjoy having longer sex lives .
We can have a glance by going through some of the research analysis given by University of Chicago Academics published on Wednesday , “ coming across all age group members , men are likely to be interested in having sex than women - and that too the gap increased with age . ”
The analysis shows , 39 percent of men at the age of 75 to 85 are interested in having sex while comparing to women having just 17 percent of interest in having sex .
Person who are above 75 years reported to have a good sex life with a percent of 71 when compared to women are likely to be with 51 percent are having good sex life .
The researchers have found out that “ men were more likely than woman to be sexually active , reporting to a good quality sex life , and be interested in sex , ” The quotes that suggest can say “ This disparity and its implication for health , requires further exploration . ”
The average age of a person goes down to 70 during their sex life .
Person who is at the age of 55 can add to their sex life for another 15 years , while women can extend to just 11 years .
Even though , a 55 year old person can have sex only through good health and excellent condition .
Good healthy men after the age of 55 can extend his sex life to an average of five to seven years while women can extend to three to six years .
Through this research we can come to know that good sex can improve the health and well - being of a person .
The research shows 1.5 to 1.8 times a good and excellent healthy persons are likely to be involved in sex than the poor health persons .
Some of the great researchers namely Stacy Tessler Laudau and Natalia Gavrilova looked at the data through two different groups of men and women - one aging from 25 to 74 and the other group aging from 57 to 85 collected from 3000 Americans .
People have been interviewed with different questionnaires containing their marital status and rating their sex lives and also asking how often they have sex .
The researchers rated the health scale between poor and excellent .
Patricia Goodson , Professor of Health from Texas A&M University , said the study was “ refreshing because it offers a health enhancing , health promoting perspective .
It shows that people who are aged above 55 are improving their sex lives .
“ It also shows how important they are giving to sex which leads to the health and prosperity of their lives during their sex lives .
Through this research we should be able to understand good health and condition alone can give you a long lasting sex for a long period .

2011 is set to see the introduction of a plug - in capable Toyota Prius , capable of charging it ’s lithium - ion cells from either a 110v or 220v household electrical outlet .
Toyota currently has 500 of the plug - in hybrids on the road in Japan , Europe and the US for testing purposes , all of these test vehicles are fitted with “ black box ” data recorders that transmit detailed telemetry on daily activity back to Toyota in order to gauge how the vehicles will be used when they hit the market in early 2011 .
The first generation plug - in hybrid will offer a somewhat limited electric only range of 13 miles , enough for a trip down to the supermarket or soccer practice perhaps but not much else .
Toyota seem to be very concerned about the potential impact that these cars will have on electrical grids , if hundreds of them all plug in at around the same time everyday it ’ll overload the grid and blow the local transformer .
It has been noted that hybrids seem to “ cluster ” in certain neighbourhoods , usually wealthier suburbs which in turn tend to be older and thus reliant on older electrical infrastructure , this could tend exacerbate the grid - overload problem .
This car is a great step into the plug - in market for Toyota , at the moment there seem to be so many people ready to buy plug - in capable cars who are frustrated at the lack of models to choose from .
We ’d like to see an electric only range of at least 50 miles but otherwise this Prius seems like the perfect midsize family car .
It ’ll need to come in at under $ 30,000 before mass adoption can occur , current pricing estimates are $ 39,500 USD , but we ’ll see significant price reduction as production volume increases and lithium - ion battery systems begin to come down in cost .
What do you think ?
Will you buy one ?

Official Toyota Product Information – Prius Plug-in
Though it was only announced last month that President Barack Obama would be the speaker at this spring 's commencement , University officials have been communicating with the White House since last April to try to get the president to speak at the Big House .
According to documents obtained by The Michigan Daily through a Freedom of Information Act request , University President Mary Sue Coleman first contacted Alyssa Mastromonaco , White House director of scheduling and advance , on April 30 , 2009 .
Following the initial letter , Coleman sent a formal invitation directly to Obama last September .
In her letter to Obama , Coleman highlighted the University ’s history as one of the premier public universities in the country .
Coleman also encouraged the president to come to Ann Arbor by referencing the University ’s commitment to topics important to his administration like economic expansion , developing alternative energy sources , sustainability and health care .
“ The University of Michigan vigorously pursues the many issues our nation faces and that you are tackling as president , ” Coleman wrote to Obama in her September letter .
“ Your visit would inspire and motivate continued progress in these areas . ”
In her letter , Coleman also referenced visits by other presidents , including John F. Kennedy ’s 1960 speech on the steps of the Michigan Union .
Kennedy , who was campaigning at the time , stood before a crowd of students at 2 a.m. to announce his plans to create the Peace Corps .
“ That night , and in the days and weeks that followed ( Kennedy ’s speech ) , the enthusiastic response of our students helped propel that brief speech into a major national program , ” Coleman wrote in the letter .
“ Today ’s students are no less dedicated , and they would be thrilled for you to challenge them directly to meet the demands of the 21st century , as their forbears were by John F. Kennedy . ”
Coleman added that the University not only has ties to past presidents but to Obama ’s administration as well .
“ I would be remiss to close without conveying how extremely proud we are of the many University of Michigan alums working for you and your administration , who could serve as a valuable resource as you consider this invitation , ” she wrote .
But Coleman was not the only one who lobbied the president to come to campus .
A group of 30 campus leaders sent a letter to Obama requesting that he speak at the Big House .
The letter from University students discussed students ’ experiences on election night in 2008 , when they celebrated on the Diag after Obama ’s victory was announced .
“ And there we stood , all united as students of University of Michigan who had witnessed history being made ; shouting in one voice , ‘ YES WE DID !’ ” the students wrote .
“ As members and representatives of the upcoming graduating class of the University of Michigan , we feel a special connection to this great day in American history . ”
LSA senior Rebekah Sharpe , assistant secretary of the University ’s chapter of the NAACP and a signatory of the letter , said she started an initiative last summer to invite Obama to this year ’s spring commencement .
Sharpe said she was put in touch with Coleman ’s office , which was already in the process of recruiting Obama , and the student representatives on the University ’s Honorary Degree Committee , the group responsible for determining the commencement speaker and those who will receive honorary degrees during the commencement ceremony .
“ I worked with the project manager at the president ’s office , and then we met with the student representatives of the Honorary Degree Committee to cultivate an innovative and creative campaign to make the University of Michigan stand out , ” Sharpe said .
Business junior Alex Serwer , one of the two student representatives on the Honorary Degree Committee and a signatory of the letter to Obama , said the letter was written as a way to show student support , without alerting the entire student body , which may have been disappointed if Obama declined the request .
“ We devised a plan so it would n’t get out to the general public , because we did n’t want students to get all excited about it and then be disappointed about it if he decided not to come , ” Serwer said .
“ But , instead , in order to show we had student support , we decided that writing a letter to the White House would be something that would be more appropriate . ”
Michigan football player David Moosman said in a phone interview last week that he signed the letter because he believes Obama ’s speech at the Big House will be “ historic . ”
“ It ’s a time of rejuvenation for the country , and Obama , I think , is leading that , ” Moosman said .
“ Him speaking and giving his wisdom and words to the next class of leaders in the community and in the global market will be inspiring and , for lack of a better word , useful . ”
Engineering senior Meha Pandey , the president of the Society of Women Engineers , said she signed the letter because she thought it was important for students to show the administration that they wanted Obama to be their commencement speaker .
“ I think it ’s a great opportunity not only for my graduating class but to have the president of the United States come to this campus , and it kind of brings recognition toward the University and makes us realize that Michigan is great , ” Pandey said .
Lisa Connolly , project manager in Coleman ’s office , also had frequent contact with Mastromonaco , according to the documents obtained through the FOIA request .
On Nov. 6 , 2009 , Connolly wrote to the White House and enclosed two previously sent invitations to Obama to speak at commencement and a previously sent invitation for Obama to come to Ann Arbor from Oct. 13 to 15 , 2010 to participate in events celebrating the 50th anniversary of the announcement of the Peace Corps .
Connolly ’s other correspondences with the White House , which included an e-mail dated Dec. 18 , 2009 and a letter dated Jan. 29 , 2010 , were both inquiries regarding the timing of any decision made about attending commencement .
Connolly also wrote that Obama ’s presence at commencement would send an unparalleled message to the graduates .
“ We believe President Obama ’s presence at the University of Michigan this spring would provide an unsurpassable send - off to our graduates as they enter a workforce laden with challenges , ” she wrote .
University officials announced that Obama would be the commencement speaker on Feb. 11 , 2010 .
Commencement will be held on May 1 at 11 a.m.
Approximately 3,500 undergraduates will be graduating and , according to a Feb. 11 Daily article , more than 40,000 friends and family members of graduates are expected to attend .

Photographer Victor Huang was diving off Wellington , New Zealand recently when an octopus snatched his video camera and swam off with it while it was filming .
Huang gave chase , and got the camera back after a few minutes , lucky for all of us .
The octopus has a nice eye for close - up action sequences and effectively establishes a dramatic tone through the use of the natural lighting available in a bed of kelp .
“ He swam away very quickly like a naughty shoplifter , ” Huang said : “ I honestly believe that it saw the bright blue digital camera and went , ’Oh I need that , ’ you know ? ”
We really , really do .
WASHINGTON -
The growing oil slick in the Gulf of Mexico is not only an environmental danger but also a widening political headache for President Obama , who just last month agreed to open vast stretches of the U.S. coastline to oil drilling .
The spill threatens to highlight the environmental risk of offshore exploration -- a risk that critics have long warned about and that Obama tried to downplay when he announced the expansion of drilling off the Atlantic Coast , in Alaska and in the Gulf of Mexico .
White House officials said Thursday that the expanded drilling plan , which is entering a public comment phase , could undergo modifications as a result of the oil spill and possible public reaction to it .
They said the same applies to the floundering Senate climate bill , which includes a provision to expand drilling in hopes of wooing Republican support .
White House press secretary Robert Gibbs said it would be impossible to say what effect the spill will have on the drilling plan until investigators determined the cause of the explosion and subsequent leak .
But top energy and climate adviser Carol Browner said " this will become part of the debate " over drilling .
" That goes without saying . "
The statements were likely to upset Republicans , many of whom criticized Obama 's drilling plan as too little , and to please environmentalists who opposed the plan .
Call to halt drilling new wells
The accident in the Gulf may provide more firepower to those critics on the left , who have for years lobbied presidents and Congress to keep in place federal moratoriums on further offshore exploration .
Those moratoriums have now expired .
Some lawmakers have already called for congressional inquiry into the regulation of offshore drilling .
Pre- and post - put hooks for Datastore models
Posted by Nick Johnson | Filed under python , app- engine , cookbook , coding
A number of people have asked about the possibility of pre- and post - put hooks for datastore models , to allow for changes or other processing before or after a model is stored to the datastore .
While such a feature is n't currently supported by App Engine , it 's quite possible for us to implement it ourselves , using monkeypatching .
This also gives us a good opportunity to show off how monkeypatching works , and how it can be used to make your own changes ( at your own risk ! ) to the App Engine SDK .
One caveat of monkeypatching is that you have to be very careful to make sure that your patch is installed at all times .
If it 's not , the changes you made will be unavailable and cause errors - or worse , simply behave differently .
This is particularly noticeable in the case of app - engine - patch , which monkeypatches models to change their kind name , causing operations on them to fail if the patch has n't been imported .
The functionality we want is about as simple as you could ask for :
We want to be able to define a method on our Model that gets called just before it is written to the datastore , and another method that is called just after .
The natural way to implement this is to introduce our own Model subclass that should be subclassed by all models wanting this functionality , and doing it this way has a major advantage :
It ensures that the monkeypatch is always installed when we 're dealing with these models .
There are two separate avenues by which an entity can be stored to the datastore , so we need to cover both : The put ( ) method on Model instances , and the db.put ( ) method .
Fortunately , since we 're subclassing Model , we can take care of the first one ourselves .
Let 's start by defining the model subclass :
class HookedModel( db. Model ) : def before_put ( self ) : pass def after_put ( self ) : pass def put( self , ** kwargs ) : self.before_put( ) super ( Hooked Model , self ) .
put (** kwargs ) self.after_put ()
That much was pretty obvious .
Now , on to the actual monkeypatch , in order to handle db.put ( ) properly .
The monkeypatch itself consists of 3 steps : Renaming the old version of the function we 're replacing so we can still access it , defining our replacement , and replacing the original with our replacement .
Without further ado , here it is , in that order :
old_put = db. put def hooked_put ( models , ** kwargs ) : for model in models : if isinstance ( model , HookedModel ) : model.before_put( ) old_put ( models , ** kwargs ) for model in models : if isinstance ( model , HookedModel ) : model.after_put( ) db. put = hooked_put
There are a few tricks we could use to neaten up the hooked_put method , but we 've left it the way it is - verbose - for clarity .
That 's all there is to it .
Put both of those in the same module , import them wherever you need them , and otherwise use them as you would a normal module .
before_delete and after_delete methods , which would work similarly except for the necessity of being class methods , are left as an exercise to the reader - as is the possibility of allowing before / after methods to return additional objects to put or delete in the same batch .

SAVANNAKHET
Small towns in Laos are experiencing an influx of migrants in search of better living conditions , increasing the strain on infrastructure and services such as water and sanitation , the UN and government officials say .
Laos is experiencing a high urbanization rate of 4 - 5 percent per annum , adding to pressure on local authorities to provide basic infrastructure , according to the UN Human Settlements Programme ( UN - HABITAT ) .
There are an estimated 139 small towns in Laos , and many of those along economic corridors – bordering Cambodia , China , Thailand and Vietnam – are seeing influxes from rural areas .
“ Many of these small towns experience high population growth , and increased pressure on the local environment .
Small towns are now becoming increasingly polluted because of a lack of adequate infrastructure , ” said Buahom Sengkhamyong , chief technical adviser for UN - HABITAT in Laos .
As part of its regional Mekong water and sanitation programme , the agency is providing improved services in small towns , especially along the economic corridors .
The lure of basic services
Water and sanitation has been identified as a development priority by the Lao government , which has floated an urban water sector investment plan estimated at US $ 266 million from 2005 to 2020 .
But as the government improves services in small towns , they are proving a draw to migrants and creating unmanageable population growth in certain areas , including southern Savannakhet Province , according to UN - HABITAT and the government 's Nam Papa State - Owned Water Supply Enterprise .
Three times a day , I travel to the well to collect water for my family to drink .
It ’s a laborious and time - consuming chore
“ In Savannakhet Province , water and sanitation services are a serious issue for many districts , ” Phandola Khouanemeuangchane , director of Nam Papa Savannakhet , told IRIN .
“ Yet , we have a more complicated problem : the districts with improved water and sanitation services are flooded with ‘ resource migrants ’ .
In the end , our services often do not meet the demands of these growing small towns , ” he said .
For Kung , a 95 - year - old woman from a village outside of Sounvouli District in Savannakhet Province , migration for her family to a small town is a dream .
“ Of course I would like to be able to move my family to a small town for better services , ” said Kung .
“ Three times a day , I travel to the well to collect water for my family to drink .
It ’s a laborious and time - consuming chore .
In April and May , our village well dries up and then we compete with our neighbours to reach the well first .
There ’s simply not enough water to go around , ” she said .
Planning challenges
In Laos , insufficient data on small - town population growth means development programmes are planned according to the national population growth rate of 2.8 percent , rather than the local rate , which is unknown .
According to Nam Papa , the number of small towns , and the percentage of the country ’s population of some 5.86 million living in small towns by 2015 , will exceed the government ’s own estimates .
“ Our investments in the sector disregard the true impact of resource migrants .
Funding will not be adequate and will not meet the demands of our small towns along the economic corridors of Savannakhet Province , ” said Phandola .
The Lao government , in its 2004 National Growth and Poverty Eradication Strategy ( NGPES ) , aims to improve services for an additional 1.95 million urban population .
But with rapid small - town growth , the NGPES will not be able to meet the demands for all the inhabitants needing improved water and sanitation services , officials say .
Meanwhile , small - town populations face the problem of the high cost of water , especially where local authorities lack the ability to supply it .
In the mountainous small town of Houn in Oudom Xai Province in northern Laos , one cubic meter of water is sold by private vendors for the equivalent of $ 3 - 26 times more than the average cost charged by Nam Papa .
“ Unless improved services are provided , the people in small towns will get into the vicious cycle of poverty which they were trying to get away from in the first place , ” said UN - HABITAT ’s Sengkhamyong .
“ Lack of water and sanitation infrastructure has a direct adverse impact on the quality of life of the communities , especially the poor , ” he said .

Who does Nico Rosberg blame for poor driving standards in F1 ?
His new team mate :
It is Michael Schumacher who started this , like at Spa , when Mika Hakkinen tried to overtake him and he ran him off the track .
When the guy behind has made a decision [ to pass ] and the guy in front then moves over , it is very dangerous .
You can not do that .
That was the first time I remember it being a dangerous issue .
Nico Rosberg
Schumacher ’s return to F1 is undoubtedly good news for the sport ’s profile but , as Rosberg clearly knows , he tends to bring controversy along with him .
Hakkinen and Schumacher were both doing around 200 mph when the McLaren driver tried to pass the Ferrari .
The onboard video above graphically illustrates the speed difference between the two cars as Hakkinen pulled out of Schumacher ’s slipstream to pass .
But the Ferrari driver squeezed Hakkinen to the far side of the track , forcing him to back off to avoid a huge crash .
Schumacher often stood accused of getting away with dangerous driving .
This infamous move drew criticism at the time ( in spite of Hakkinen ’s successful pass on the next lap ) .
Almost ten years on , do we now view this as a new low in driving standards that other drivers are now mimicking because they know they will get away with it ?
Rosberg was talking to reporters in Abu Dhabi at the race earlier this year when he compared recent controversial incidents at Interlagos with Schumacher ’s Spa move .
Here ’s more of what he said :
Barrichello , Webber and Kobayashi did exactly the same thing [ at Interlagos ] .
With Webber , Raikkonen lost his front wing , with Kobayashi , Nakajima had a massive off , which could have been much worse – you can really hurt yourself , marshals and others in that sort of accident .
With Barrichello , Lewis ran into the back of his tyre .
That was the third time ?
����ǣ and it is not allowed to happen .
Nico Rosberg
Rosberg ’s comment struck me as surprising at the time because drivers are rarely so candid about this sort of thing .
It came on the same weekend that Jarno Trulli vehemently criticised Adrian Sutil over their crash at Interlagos .
While Trulli spent ten years racing against Schumacher , drivers like Sutil are part of the post - Schumacher generation – who watched him at work , seen what he could get away with , and copied it .
It ’s true that other drivers before Schumacher were accused of using unacceptable tactics on the race track – Ayrton Senna and Rene Arnoux to name just two .
But it seems to me that Schumacher pushed the limits even further – into dangerous territory .
Another dimension to Schumacher ’s return is how Mercedes will handle it .
We saw at Monaco in 2006 that Ferrari would support Schumacher even when he was caught red - handed in a brazen act of cheating .
Will Mercedes be as willing to indulge Schumacher ’s ‘ win at any cost ’ mentality ?
That was one of the rare occasions when Schumacher was handed a meaningful punishment for his transgression .
More often than not the FIA turned a blind eye to his dubious moves .
So should we blame them or Schumacher for some of the questionable driving which goes on in F1 today ?
Whichever , I doubt we ’ll get to the end of 2010 without this argument coming up again .
Driving standards in F1
A forecast increase of $ 15 a month in electricity costs for householders is n't as high as it sounds , says an energy consulting firm .
It 's actually higher .
Aegent Energy Advisors Inc. says that by 2011 , consumers will typically be paying about $ 25 a month more for electricity than they do today , an increase of $ 300 a year .
That 's a 26 per cent increase for a typical Toronto household , which now pays just under $ 100 a month , says Aegent .
At Queen 's Park , Energy and Infrastructure Minister Brad Duguid disputed the figure , but did not offer one of his own .
" Those numbers do n't appear to be anything near to what I 've seen , " Duguid told the Star .
He pointed out that time - of - use pricing allows consumers to shift power use to lower - priced times of the day .
" But ... we do note that energy costs are on the rise for a variety of reasons , " Duguid said .
Toronto Hydro has estimated that several converging tax and price increases could push the typical household 's cost of power up about $ 15 a month , or $ 180 a year .
But Aegent says a series of high - priced contracts signed with nuclear and renewable electricity generators will add costs by 2011 , pushing the yearly increase to about $ 300 .
Its analysis in a newsletter calls increases that consumers have seen to date only " the tip of an approaching iceberg . "
Bruce Sharp of Aegent , which advises clients negotiating electricity and natural gas purchases , said consumers need to understand that moving away from coal - fired generation to other forms of power , like renewables , comes with a cost .
" We 'd like there to be more transparent , so it 's more of an informed decision , " he said in an interview .
Aegent agrees with Toronto Hydro that a $ 15 - a - month increase is coming within months , as several increases converge .
They include :
Introduction of time - of - use billing .
Some customers are already on this system , which charges 9.3 cents a kilowatt hour at peak periods , 4.4 cents at off - peak times such as overnight and weekends , and eight cents in mid-peak periods .
( The current price is 5.8 cents to 6.7 cents a kilowatt hour . )
Toronto Hydro 's experience with the first 10,000 customers to go on time - of - use rates is that 92 per cent see an increase in their bills , averaging about $ 2.38 a month .
The new harmonized sales tax .
HST will add 8 per cent to everyone 's bill starting July 1 – about an $ 8 a month increase .
Both Ontario Power Generation and Toronto Hydro are seeking increases at the Ontario Energy Board .
Those increases , plus some smaller ones , will total about $ 15 a month , subject to energy board approval of the rate applications
Aegent then casts its eye into 2011 , as a number of generators with a combined capacity of 5,000 megawatts start supplying power at rates considerably higher than the current market rate of about 3.8 cents a kilowatt hour ( kwh ) .
Some additional nuclear generation will get seven cents a kilowatt hour , Aegent estimates .
A number of wind developments will come on stream , paid 14 cents a kwh , and some solar power at 44 cents a kwh .
Those prices are higher than what consumers or businesses now pay for the energy portion of the bill .
Consumers not on time - of - use rates now pay 5.8 cents a kwh for much of their power , and 6.7 cents if they exceed a threshold of 600 kwh in summer or 1,000 kwh in winter .
( Charges for delivering power , debt and administrative fees , roughly double the final price . )

Duguid said time - of - use rates give consumers a tool to trim their energy costs , if they 're willing to shift chores such as laundry to weekend or overnight hours .
Progressive Conservative energy critic John Yakabuski said the $ 25 a month tally sounded accurate , and blamed the Liberals for prices .
" It does sound realistic but it 's unfortunate that so much of this is tied to the energy policies that this government has adopted since it 's been elected , " said Yakabuski ( Renfrew - Nipissing - Pembroke ) .
Techart tuning firm surprised us ( in a pleasant way ) with the new aero kit for Porsche Panamera , called the Black Edition .
Porsche Panamera Black Edition by Techart
Black is not for everyone , because it means great experience , autonomy and power ; that ’s why the new model was painted in matt black and its Techart 22 inch rims with alloy wheels are also painted in black .
Porsche Panamera Black Edition by Techart
This aerodynamic kit includes : front spoiler , taillight and headlamp trims , side skirts , roof and rear spoiler , rear wing and diffusor .
At the interior , black is dominating all accessories , with black leather and Alcantara and flamenco red inserts ; we also can see black floor mats .
Porsche Panamera Black Edition by Techart
The Black Edition from Techart generates 368 kW/500 hp making the car to reach a top speed of 303 km /h .
The price for the full Panamera Black Edition is about 220.000 Euros .

For anyone who has ever lost a cellphone , remember this : it could be worse .
You could be the person who left his phone in a bar in California .
And it was n’t just any phone ; it was a supersecret version of the next iPhone .
That model is not expected to be formally unveiled for a couple of months .
For the people at Apple , it must be like a bad version of the guy walks into a bar joke .
The company is known as the most secretive in Silicon Valley , and leaks are rare .
But after the phone prototype was left in a bar in the Silicon Valley town of Redwood City , photos of the device began appearing over the weekend in technology blogs , sparking a frenzy of hype among the Apple - obsessed .
Before long , pictures of the product appeared on Gizmodo , a technology news site , whose editors ripped it apart — as if it were an alien from another planet — to dissect its features .
The Web site said late Monday that the phone belonged to an Apple engineer .
The phone ’s authenticity was hotly debated , but most bloggers concluded it was real .
And a person with knowledge of Apple ’s hardware plans who was not authorized to speak on behalf of the company confirmed to The New York Times that it was real .
The third bidder - a group of hedge funds and other financial institutions that controls most of the company 's debt - has included a bid condition that would force the current owners to terminate all 4,500 of its workers , union and nonunion , agreeing to rehire at least 51 percent , Sonenshine said , but allowing the new owners to vastly reduce the workforce .
Therefore , because God 's word condemns same sex physical relationships ( Leviticus 18:22 , 20:13 ; Romans 1:24 - 32 ) , calling them abomination , and considering them a capitol crime against society and nature worthy of the death penalty .
Be it resolved , That we insist upon enforcement of the law ( Section 654 , Title 10 ) by eliminating the Clinton Administration 's policy known as " Do n't Ask , Don't Tell , " which is inconsistent with the 1993 law ( Section 654 , Title 10 ) .
That the question about homosexuality that used to be on induction forms prior to January 1993 be restored .
That we oppose any legislative attempt to repeal the 1993 homosexual conduct law in Congress .

World coal - fired power plant capacity will grow from 1,759,000 MW in 2010 to 2,384,000 MW in 2020 .
Some 80,000 MW will be replaced .
So there will be 705,000 MW of new coal - fired boilers built .
The annual new boiler sales will average 70,000 MW .
The annual investment will be $ 140 billion .
These are the most recent forecasts in Coal - fired Boilers : World Analysis and Forecast published by the McIlvaine Company Coal - fired power in Asia will rise to 1,464,000 MW in 2020 up from 918,000 MW this year .
This will account for an increase in CO2 of 2.6 billion tons .
So even if the US and Europe were to cut CO2 emissions by far more than the targeted 20 percent , the total CO2 increase from Asia will offset it by a wide margin .
Coal - fired power in India will rise from 95,000 MW to 294,000 MW over the next 11 years .
This accounts for the largest percentage rise ( 300 ) plus the biggest quantitative rise ( 199,000 MW ) .
So India alone will increase CO2 by 955 million tons per yearThe US presently operates coal - fired power plants at a much lower efficiency than those in Europe .
Many of the new Chinese power plants are highly efficient .
A number of small old power plants have been replaced .
However within the last decade China has increased capacity from less than 50 per cent to more than 200 percent of the US capacity .
Its CO2 emissions far exceed those from US power plants .
Since coal is also still burned in residential and commercial boilers , Chinese total coal burning CO2 emissons far exceed the US .
China and India have coal resources .
Other Asian countries have access to supplies from Australia and other nearby sources .
The cost of coal - fired power is low compared to the alternatives in the near - term .
Since planning of new coal - fired power plants occurs as much as a decade in advance , there is not likely to be a major change in the forecast through 2020 .
Any impact of renewable energy in Asia is only likely to happen after 2020 .
McIlvaine Compan y tracks every coal - fired power project in World Power Generation Projects .

First , a bit of a disclaimer : I never liked Apple ’s iPhoto .
The first versions of it bloated your hard drive by a factor of two , copying each and every one of your precious photos to a different directory and converting them to PDF files (?! ) without giving you any say in the matter .
Even today it still requires some kind of proprietary database to run .
If something happens to that , you ’re screwed — even if your photos themselves are fine .
So really , as a new ( full - time ) Linux user I ’m looking more for a replacement for the dearly departed iView MediaPro , which likely went all to hell after Microsoft bought it a few years back .
My requirements for a photo manager are fairly meagre — all I really need to do is :
Organize photos into separate catalogs ;
Rotate them as needed and have the results saved ;
View a variety of file types , specifically PNG and Camera RAW .
Here then , are three contenders that I tested on my Linux Mint install :
Shotwell was up first — it seemed very responsive and full - featured , with two notable exceptions .
First , it imports all photos into a single collection ( you can separate them by date ) and second , it does n’t seem to have any built - in support for PNG graphics .
As I collect a lot of screen grabs from my various computers and mobile devices this made Shotwell a non-starter for me .
F - Spot is arguably the most popular of the three apps I tested , with enough features to make it encroach upon more heavyweight photo editors like the GIMP .
This might also be its downfall , however , as it seemed to me the least responsive — certainly not pokey enough to be unusable , but enough that it was noticed .
Oh , and it does n’t have multiple catalog support either .
Even more popular than F - spot is Google ’s Picasa — I did n’t test that , partly because it runs under Windows emulation using Wine , and partly because I ’ve a particularly awful Google handle that anyone looking at my online Picasa gallery would see .
I ’m vain that way .
g Thumb hits that sweet spot of giving me almost everything I need and little more .
Plus it was the only app I could find with support for multiple photo catalogs .
A bit surprising for yours truly was that all three of these solutions support Camera RAW files — at least the ones from my Canon DSLR — with no extra plug-ins required .
But none give me the ability to save a catalog to a specific location on my hard drive .
On each of these apps such things are stored invisibly somewhere in your user space where you ca n’t easily get at them — just like iPhoto .
And that ’s not necessarily a good thing , at least for me .
Thankfully there are lots of choices for Linux photo managers — click here for some more ideas .
And if you know of an app that supports portable catalogs ( ones I could back up to another disk ) , hit me up with a link below !
Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback
Ben Roethlisberger will not be charged after an investigation into accusations of sexual assault by a 20 - year - old woman in Georgia , sources told ESPN .
Sources confirmed to ESPN 's Kelly Naqi that District Attorney Fred Bright will announce on Monday that charges will not be brought against Roethlisberger .
Bright said in a statement Friday he has reviewed all the investigation reports and will hold a news conference at 2 p.m. ET Monday .
Milledgeville police Chief Woodrow Blue said Wednesday his department and the Georgia Bureau of Investigation had wrapped up their investigation into a 20 - year - old college student 's claim that Roethlisberger sexually assaulted her early March 5 at a club in Milledgeville .
Roethlisberger 's lawyer , Ed Garland , has disputed the assault
claim and hired his own team to investigate .
" I want everyone to realize that Ben Roethlisberger has never
been accused of any criminal conduct by any law enforcement agency
in his life , " Garland told The Associated Press Friday .
" We
believe the correct decision by the district attorney in this
matter should be that no criminal charges will be made against
him . "
An attorney for the woman did not immediately return calls
seeking comment Friday .
A Steelers spokesman did not have a
comment .
The Pittsburgh Post - Gazette reported that Roethlisberger declined to answer any questions regarding the case .
It was the second time in a year that Roethlisberger has been accused of sexual misconduct .
He also faces a lawsuit filed last July by a woman who says he raped her in 2008 at a Lake Tahoe hotel and casino , an allegation he denies .
Roethlisberger has not been criminally charged in either case and has claimed counterdamages in the lawsuit .
Roethlisberger did not report to Pittsburgh 's offseason workouts last month .
The next critical day for players is April 19 , when on - field practice starts .
Most of the team is expected to be on hand then .
ESPN 's Kelly Naqi and The Associated Press contributed to this report .

Advertisement A series of explosions in the Thai capital Bangkok is reported to have killed at least three people and injured scores more .
Deputy Prime Minister Suthep Thaugsuban said grenades had been fired from a camp of anti-government protesters .
The explosions followed rising tensions in the stand - off between police and opposition demonstrators in the city .
Thai Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva has called an emergency meeting with security chiefs , officials said .
Mr Suthep said three people had been killed and more than 70 wounded in the explosions .
Hospitals in Bangkok had only confirmed one person killed .
ANALYSIS Vaudine England , BBC News , Bangkok Bangkok has been wired up for danger for days now .
A second attempt by the military to crack down on the anti-government protesters is widely predicted - the first failed on 10 April with 25 people killed .
The city 's fears were heightened by an army spokesman 's warning that " time is running out " .
The military commander has repeated his commitment to a non-violent solution to the stand - off - if possible .
The red - shirts refuse to go away , and refuse to have peace talks .
In this febrile atmosphere , the explosion of at least five grenades could be the trigger for wider violence .
As ever throughout this fraught ramping up of pressure on the government , each side could step back .
But the record of violence does not bode well for what could be a new and tragic phase in a bitter political conflict .
He said at least one M - 79 grenade launcher had been used in the attacks , adding : " It was clear that it was shot from behind the King Rama VI Monument where the red- shirts are rallying . "
However , red - shirt leaders denied that their supporters were responsible for the blasts .
Television images showed a chaotic scene with ambulances streaming into the area and panicked residents helping to carry the injured to safety .
Blood was splattered across pavements and office windows were smashed .
Reports said two foreigners were believed to be among the injured .
Army spokesman Col Sansern Kaewkamnerd said five grenades had been fired .
Three fell through the roof of the Saladaeng Skytrain station , along Silom Road , the centre of Bangkok 's business district , he said .
A fourth exploded on the pavement near the five - star Dusit Thani Hotel and the fifth near a bank , he added .
He said the same type of grenade - fired from a shoulder - mounted launcher - had hit troops during bloody clashes with protesters that killed 25 people on 10 April .
The explosions happened near an intersection where troops are facing barricades manned by anti-government red-shirt protesters .
Their base has been fortified in recent days with sharpened bamboo stakes and piles of car tyres .
The red - shirts - who are calling for fresh elections - have been camped out in the city for six weeks .
The volatile atmosphere has recently been heightened by pro-government protesters , waving Thai flags and hurling abuse and water bottles at the red-shirts .
The BBC's Alastair Leithead , who is at the scene , says a group of a dozen or so people have walked through police lines and started throwing bottles and stones towards barricades manned by red - shirt protesters .

The reds are firing fireworks into the air and police are watching , doing nothing to stop them , he says .
The government is under pressure to crack down on the protesters .
Thai leaders have said they want a negotiated , peaceful end to the dispute , but observers say a non-violent solution is increasingly unlikely .
Both the US and the UN urged all sides to exercise restraint .
" We appeal to the protesters and Thai authorities to avoid further violence and loss of life and to work to resolve the situation peacefully through dialogue , " said UN spokesman Martin Nesirky .
The BBC's Rachel Harvey in Bangkok says there has been a series of unexplained grenade attacks in Bangkok in recent weeks , coinciding with the anti-government demonstration - although protest leaders deny any involvement .
Earlier , Col Sunsern warned that the protesters ' time to move out was " running out " .
" If there is a crackdown , innocent people might get hurt , " he said .
" If we move in , we will attempt to arrest the leaders . "
" The government will be very decisive but in the beginning of the operation there may be chaos . "

Tens of thousands of sea turtles were trapped and killed by commercial fishing fleets over the past 20 years , but real total could number millions
Millions of sea turtles have been inadvertently trapped and killed by commercial fishing fleets over the last 20 years , a global survey has found .
Six of the seven species of sea turtle are under threat .
The study , published in Conservation Letters , said the biggest danger to their survival was being inadvertently caught up by commercial fishing gear - long lines which can stretch for up to 40 kms studded with hooks or vast nets - to become what is known as bycatch .
Once snared , the turtles are unable to come to the surface to breathe .
Although turtles , the second largest reptile species on Earth , are still hunted for their meat and shells , accidental entrapment is a greater threat .
" Bycatch , writ large , is the most serious , acute threat to the sea turtle population globally , " said Bryan Wallace , the lead author .
" Trawlers are completely indiscriminate .
The target might be shrimp but for every pound of shrimp that might comp up with a given haul , there might have five or 20 lbs of bycatch .
That could be turtles , it could be all sorts of things , " said Wallace , a professor at Duke University and science adviser to Conservation International .
The study is the first global survey of commercial fishing operations , gauging the effects on sea turtles of three widely used methods of fishing gear : long lines , gillnets and trawls .
It reviewed existing records from fishing fleet operations around the world .
All the data was based on direct onboard observations or interviews with fishermen .
According to those records , more than 85,000 turtles were snared between 1990 and 2008 .
But Wallace said the figure covered barely 1 % of fishing operations , and did not cover smaller fleets .
" A conservative estimate is that the true total is probably in the millions of turtles , " he said .
However , he said the adoption of different equipment - such as turtle excluder devices or escape hatches which allow turtles to swim free of large nets - could dramatically reduce the numbers of bycatch .
Some countries have now made such precautions mandatory .
One of the report 's recommendations was for consumers to be conscious of where their fish was sourced .
The report also recommends seasonal bans on fishing to avoid turtle migration routes .
The report identified four regions where urgent conservation measures are needed : the Mediterranean , the eastern Pacific , and the south and north - west Atlantic off the coast of the United States .
It said the crowded , heavily fished Mediterranean had some of the highest rates of bycatch because of heavy use of long lines and trawling .
The coast off Mexico's Baja Peninsula , a crucial nesting area for sea turtles , was also deadly .
According to the IUCN red list of endangered species , five species of sea turtle - hawksbill , leatherback , Kemp 's Ridley , green and loggerhead - are either endangered or critically endangered .
The Olive Ridley is classed as vulnerable while flatback turtles are classed as " data deficient " , meaning there is not enough research to make a conservation assessment .

MAOIST insurgents claiming to fight for India 's rural poor killed at least 76 soldiers overnight in a series of carefully planned ambushes in the forests of eastern India , underscoring the rebels ' strength despite a government offensive .
The attack by hundreds of Maoists in a rebel stronghold in Chhattisgarh state was the deadliest by the militants against government forces in their 43 - year insurgency .
The rebels launched the initial attack early in the morning local time , firing on a group of soldiers as they returned to base from a two - day patrol in Chhattisgarh 's Dantewada forests , SK Pillai , the federal home secretary , said in New Delhi .
More soldiers were killed when they stepped on land mines the Maoists planted throughout the ambush zone , he said .
RK Vij , the inspector general of the Chhattisgarh police , said 17 more soldiers who went to recover the bodies were killed in land mine explosions .
More than 500 guerrillas - known as Naxalites - were involved in the attacks , said Insp - Gen Vij .
He said 76 soldiers were killed and seven wounded , three critically .
The government found no rebel bodies .
Indian Home Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram , the nation 's top law enforcement official , said the soldiers were part of a joint operation involving state forces and paramilitary fighters .
" But something has gone very wrong .
They seemed to have walked into a trap set by the Naxalites .
Casualties are quite high and I am deeply shocked , " he said .
Few other details were available from the isolated , thickly forested area .
The rebels rarely speak to the press .
Inspired by Chinese revolutionary leader Mao Zedong , the rebels have tapped into the rural poor 's growing anger at being left out of the country 's economic gains and are now present in 20 of the country 's 28 states .
Named after Naxalbari , the village in West Bengal state where their movement was born in 1967 , they have an estimated 10,000 to 20,000 fighters .
While many are poorly armed - often going into battle with handmade weapons forged from plumbing pipes - they regularly launch bloody attacks on government forces .
In February , they killed at least 24 police officers in West Bengal state in an attack on their camp .
The government dismisses Naxalite claims to speak for the country 's poor , arguing they do little but wreak havoc in some of India 's most impoverished regions .
" The Maoist ideology is a dead - end ideology .
The killing of innocent people as well as destruction of public property , including schools , bridges , roads and culverts has really nothing to offer to people whom they claim to represent , " Mr Pillai said .
The soldiers attacked overnight were part of the government 's Operation Green Hunt offensive , which is aimed at flushing the militants out of their forest hide - outs .
Several experts questioned the government offensive , saying inadequately trained and poorly equipped soldiers were often sitting ducks for Maoists much more familiar with the terrain .
" It 's a flawed operation , " said KPS Gill , a retired senior police officer involved in operations in several insurgency - hit areas .
The heat alone , he said , would weaken soldiers on long patrols .
April temperatures in the area often hit 43 degrees Celsius .
In the past few months that the Indian government has cracked down on the rebels it has also said it was ready to discuss all their demands , but only if they gave up violence .
About 2000 people - including police , militants and civilians - have been killed over the past few years .
Originally published as Maoist rebels kill 76 soldiers
This release is available in German .
No one knows how many mothers ' and babies ' lives have been saved by the obstetrical forceps .
This device has been part of the standard equipment of every maternity room for about 250 years .
However , a shadow lies over the success story : after the Chamberlen brothers developed the device at the beginning of the 17th century , the brothers and their descendants used it for 3 generations , but kept it a secret from other obstetricians .
While thanks to the forceps the Chamberlen family became rich and famous , at the same time women and babies were still dying elsewhere because the device was not available .
The story of the obstetrical forceps is one of the oldest documented examples showing what consequences secrecy in medicine can have .
In an article published in the journal Trials , researchers at the German Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care ( IQWiG ) compiled over 60 examples illustrating how the dissemination of medical knowledge has been impeded .
For this purpose , they assessed hundreds of articles from journals and other sources , which covered areas including treatment for psychiatric disorders , pain , heart and circulatory disease , skin disease , cancer , and infectious diseases .
A wide range of interventions was affected : from drugs and vaccines to medical devices such as ultrasound or devices for wound care .
The collection reads like the script for a crime series .
Concealment is common
In science the phenomenon is called " publication bias " , i.e. bias through selective publication .
This occurs on two levels :
On the first level complete studies remain unpublished .
For example , an analysis of 90 drugs that had been newly approved in the US showed that they had been tested in a total of 900 trials .
However , even 5 years after approval , 60 % of these studies were unpublished .
On the second level only selected outcomes from studies are published .
Nowadays researchers have to specify in a study protocol which outcomes they want to measure and how they are going to analyse them .
Comparisons of protocols and journal articles of studies showed that in 40 % to 60 % of studies , results had either been completely omitted or analyses changed .
" In this way study results are often presented in a more positive way than is actually the case , " says Beate Wieseler , Deputy Head of IQWiG's Drug Assessment Department .
This does not only affect studies sponsored by the pharmaceutical industry .
In their paper , the IQWiG authors also cite an analysis in which 2000 studies on cancer topics were analysed according to sponsorship .
The proportion of published studies was extremely low : of the industry - sponsored studies , 94 % were unpublished ; however , even 86 % of university - sponsored studies were also unpublished .
" Due to legal regulations , regulatory authorities are also sometimes obliged to withhold data , " says Thomas Kaiser , Head of the Drug Assessment Department .
Patients are harmed
The concealment of knowledge often has consequences for patients .
On the one hand , it can result in delays to the implementation and dissemination of beneficial interventions ( as was the case with the obstetrical forceps ) .
However , it is more common that bad news and reports of failure remain unpublished .
" As a result , physicians and patients use treatments that are actually futile or even harmful , " says Beate Wieseler .
For example , researchers estimate that drugs prescribed in the 1980s to prevent irregular heart beat cost tens of thousands of lives , because early signs of dangerous adverse effects were not published .
Appeals are insufficient
IQWiG's search for documented examples of publication bias was triggered by the Institute 's own experience in its daily work , as was recently the case , for example , in the assessment of reboxetine , a drug used to treat depression : the pharmaceutical company Pfizer only provided previously concealed studies to IQWiG after subjection to public pressure .
In the previously unpublished studies , the results for reboxetine were considerably worse than appeared to be the case in published studies .
" For many years , not only patients but also physicians have been deceived , " says Beate Wieseler .
The collection of examples published in Trials shows that the tendency to conceal unfavourable results or results that do not fulfil one 's own expectations is so widespread that appeals and proposals for voluntary solutions will not be able to solve the problem effectively .
" The increasing registration of studies in public registries is an important first step , " says Thomas Kaiser .
" However , in order to protect patients , we need legal regulations , so that results of all clinical trials are published swiftly and completely . "

For Britain's hard - pressed armaments industry , it was a lucrative deal with a trusted ally .
Between 1971 and 1976 , the increasingly despotic Shah of Iran had signed on the dotted line for 1,500 state - of - the - art Chieftain battle tanks and 250 repair vehicles costing £ 650 million .
Even better , Persia ’s King of Kings paid the British government for his new weaponry up front .
The problem came in 1979 when , with just 185 tanks delivered to Tehran , the Iranian Revolution deposed Shah Pahlavi and installed an Islamic Republic with a somewhat less warm stance towards the United Kingdom .
The massive deal , fully sanctioned by the Ministry of Defence , foundered and the Iranians , perhaps understandably , asked for their money back .
London refused and - after flogging a number of its suddenly surplus tanks to Iran ’s most bitter enemy in the shape of Saddam Hussein ’s Iraq - the British government has for 30 years fought a little - noticed but bitter legal wrangle in an obscure international trade court based in the Netherlands to hold onto what remains of the Shah ’s money .
Until now .
The Independent can reveal that Britain is to pay back nearly £ 400 m to Iran ’s defence ministry after finally admitting defeat in the dispute in a move that will be heralded by Tehran as a major diplomatic triumph while it continues its international brinkmanship with the West over its nuclear ambitions .
Financial restrictions imposed by the European Union on Iranian banks , which freeze any of Tehran ’s assets held abroad , mean that Iran will not be able to access the funds .
They will instead be held in a trust account overseen by independent trustees .
The money will join £ 976 m of Iranian assets already frozen in Britain .
But the surrender of a large sum of public money to the very arm of the Iranian government accused of spearheading the development of a nuclear weapon is embarrassing for Britain and likely to be seized on by Tehran as evidence of British hypocrisy in its dealings with the Islamic regime .
One British source said : “ Given the context of current relations , a large payment of this type looks like a propaganda gift . ”
It is understood that the settlement between International Military Services ( IMS ) Ltd , the state - owned private company used by the MoD to strike the tank deal with the Shah in the 1970s , and the Iranian Ministry of Defence and Support for Armed Forces Logistics ( MODSAF ) will be finalised in the coming weeks .
The final payment , including three decades of compound interest , is expected to be about £ 390m .
The MoD insisted that the pay out will not come from its own stretched budget .
In anticipation of a defeat as far back as 2002 , Britain paid nearly £ 486 m into the High Court to meet the cost of any settlement .
A Government spokeswoman told The Independent : “ The dispute between International Military Services Ltd ( IMS ) and Iran relates to contracts signed in the 1970s with the pre-revolution Iranian regime .
EU sanctions will prevent the current Iranian regime from accessing funds resulting from this case and could be released only if sanctions are lifted .
“ Funding to meet the settlement was paid to the High Court jointly by the Treasury and IMS in 2002 - it will not come from the defence budget .
IMS is a private limited company but is owned by the Government .
It is rightly subject to , and will comply with , UK and international law . ”
The multi-million pound agreement will bring to an end one of the more tortuous and murky sagas in that most opaque and scandal - riddled area of international affairs - nation - to - nation arms deals .
Bloated by surplus cash from Iran ’s oil wealth , the notoriously autocratic and ruthless Shah became a favoured client of British and American arms companies during the 1970s as he developed a vast arsenal of state - of - the - art weaponry from his key allies , including US F - 14 and F - 15 fighter planes which remained in service in the Iranian air force until recently .
Two of the biggest deals of the era were struck between IMS and the state - owned Royal Ordnance Factories ( ROF ) , and the imperial Persian military for Britain ’s much - admired Chieftain battle tank , at the time the most powerful and technologically - advanced weapon of its kind , and a modified version known as an Armoured Recovery Vehicle ( ARV ) , used to retrieve damaged tanks from the battle field .
A total of 1,500 Chieftains were ordered in 1971 and a further 250 ARVs bought in 1976 at a total cost of £ 650 m , paid in advance by the Iranian government .
The enormous project , reminiscent of the subsequent vast Al Yamamah deal struck between Britain and Saudi Arabia under Margaret Thatcher , involved more than the supply of large quantities of the United Kingdom ’s most prized military hardware .
As well as offering training to the Shah ’s army , Britain agreed to build an industrial complex near the city Isfahan to manufacture Chieftain parts and ammunition .
The deal was hailed as a major coup for Britain , guaranteeing thousands of jobs at ROF plants in the industrial heartlands .
Such was the importance of the scheme that in the immediate aftermath of the Iranian revolution which swept Ayatollah Khomeini to power , Britain continued to supply tank parts to Tehran .
But the outbreak of the Iranian hostage crisis , during which 53 American embassy staff were held for more than a year , put paid to any lingering hopes of resuming the deal - sparking panic in the British government about the future of the armaments industry and what to do with the dozens of Chieftains and ARVs parked in factories awaiting delivery to Iran .
Recalling the trepidation in MoD circles , David Gibbons , the senior commercial officer of IMS told Sir Richard Scott ’s 1996 Arms to Iraq Inquiry : “ When the Revolution occurred something akin to panic broke out within the MoD / ROF axis .
Export approvals across the board for military contracts were withdrawn .
The MoD was faced with the nightmarish prospect of wholesale redundancies and disorganisation within [ the arms industry ] .
As a result there was imminent danger of the partial collapse of a significant sector of the UK defence industry , with the attendant political and industrial consequences . ”
In order to avoid such disarray , the Thatcher government hastily agreed to sell 279 Chieftains to Jordan .
What it did not declare publicly was that , under the cover of the Jordanian deal , Britain was also selling 29 surplus ARVs to Saddam Hussein ’s Iraq shortly before it began its bloody eight - year war with Iran , which claimed 500,000 lives .
Such was the secrecy of the 1980 deal , which would have contravened Britain ’s stated position of neutrality in the Iran - Iraq war , that all IMS records relating to it were shredded apart from a letter signed by Lord Strathcona , a junior MoD minister , authorising the transaction .
That document was kept locked in a safe at IMS ’s central London offices .
When Iraq later tried to buy spares for the ARVs in 1985 , senior British military officers unaware of the clandestine sale assumed they were for use to repair Iranian Chieftains captured in battle .
The Independent understands that it is likely Saddam used the ARVs immediately after their arrival from Britain as a source for spare parts for Iranian tanks captured early in the war , thus enhancing his battlefield capacities .
The revelation of such cloak and dagger activity by the Arms to Iraq Report provoked an angry response from Iran , which complained bitterly to London that such evidence of double - dealing had added insult to the injury of Britain ’s continued refusal to repatriate the tank deal money paid by the Shah .
Jim Cousins , the retiring Labour MP for Newcastle Central , who has raised the ongoing dispute in Parliament , said the matter was raised angrily during a visit by British MPs to Tehran in 1997 .
He said : “ The Iranians consider this to be a very important issue .
There is a very strong perception that they were cheated on the tank deal .
They feel very strongly that Britain keeps lecturing them on the importance of the rule of law and adhering to contracts , and that it has been hypocritical by clinging onto the funds from a deal made more than three decades ago . ”
Armed with massed ranks of international lawyers , both sides took their fight to the arbitration court of the International Chamber of Commerce sitting in The Hague , where the dispute remained mired in litigation until Britain lost its final appeal against a finding that it was liable to pay the outstanding sum in April 2009 .
The final settlement , expected before the end of May , will be registered with the High Court in London .
The Iranian Embassy in London yesterday declined comment on the negotiations .
Professor Ali Ansari , the leading Iran expert , based at St Andrews University , said : “ I think there will be surprise that this could not have been done more quickly .
It has taken an enormously long time to get resolved .
Any debtor will always drag their feet but London has dragged this out spectacularly .
I suppose this shows the tenacity of Iran on these matters .
They really do not let these things go . ”
The government - owned company at the heart of the deal
With its offices situated a conveniently short walk from the Ministry of Defence , International Military Services Ltd was the private company with a difference that placed itself at the heart of a string of lucrative and controversial arms deals throughout the 1970s and 1980s .
While it outwardly behaved like any other limited company , the reality was that the behind its brass plate on Abbey Orchard Street in Westminster , IMS Ltd remained owned entirely by the British government .
The company , whose sole shareholder was the Secretary of State for Defence , was set up in 1974 under Harold Wilson 's Labour administration , ironically with the aim of cleaning up state - sponsored arms deals in Britain by removing the need for agents and middlemen who took excessive " commissions " in previous deals with other states .
Staffed by senior civil servants and trusted City executives , IMS and its predecessor , Millbank Technical Services ( MTS ) , was designed to put the MoD at arm 's length from the process of securing and discharging defence export contracts " in the interests of the Government and of industry " .
This quasi - official status allowed IMS to act as a " trustworthy intermediary " , according to internal MoD documents .
Under these arrangements the company would " buy " armaments in a paper transaction from the Government and / or manufacturers .
Once the goods had been sent to the foreign customer , critics of MTS said it had been able to present an inflated bill that included bribes paid to secure the deal .
There is no evidence that the practice was continued by IMS before it ceased trading in 1991 .
Over a period of about 15 years , IMS set up offices in India , Saudi Arabia and Iran , where it oversaw the deal to sell Chieftain tanks and Rapier missiles to the Shah .
Until 1985 , it was headed by Lord Cuckney , a former MI5 officer who became one of Margaret Thatcher 's favourite businessmen .
During the 1980s , IMS branched out into providing support services for the military forces of foreign regimes .
In 1985 , the Conservative trade minister Lord Sainsbury said : " This can and does cover a wide range of activities but it can be defined in general terms ... as the supply of military equipment and the provision of associated support such as the installation , commissioning and maintenance of equipment and the training of personnel . "
In Russia sometimes they dare to have wild animals like pets .
There are no any law regulations on what pets you can keep and what you can’t , no PETA , no need to pick up your little friend ’s poo in special bags .
You can walk with your pet anywhere on the street or public park , no any single “ no pets allowed ” signs outside .
Some call it chaos others call it freedom , you decide yourself .
Meanwhile some photos of such wild pet living with people in just a small regular flat in big multistored building .
The cat on the pictures is so called Fishing Cat , you can read more on those at Wiki .
It ’s not very common in Russia , and might have been brought from some distant parts like Tajikistan by Russian soldier .
The project has already captured some stunning images of wildcats
A new research project in the Highlands has provided a rare insight into the secret world of one of Britain 's most endangered and elusive species .
Scottish wildcats are notoriously secretive , but conservationists are hoping to gain a more detailed understanding of their behaviour .
They have attached specialist camera equipment , known as photo - traps , to trees in the Cairngorms National Park .
The cameras have already provided images of wildcats and other animals .
Motion detectors and infra-red technology allow the devices to capture images of passing animals over a period of days , weeks or even months .
The project is still in its early stages but the cameras have already provided images of Scottish wildcat - popularly known as the Highland tiger - and other animals , including golden eagles .
' Major threat '
The research is being led by Dr David Hetherington of the Cairngorms National Park Authority .
He told BBC Scotland : " Wildcats are very shy , secretive animals .
They are active mainly at night and it's really difficult for people to get close enough to watch them properly .
" These camera traps are an excellent way of us getting a much better insight into where wildcats live , when they 're active , and what habitat they 're using .
" We can also get an idea of where they do n't live and , of course , that 's also really important information . "
Experts believe the Scottish wildcat population has fallen to about 400 , and work is under way to prevent the species becoming extinct .
Other animals , including this golden eagle , have also been photographed That involves encouraging cat owners in the Highlands to ensure their animals are neutered .
Dr Hetherington explained : " The major threat to wildcats these days is hybridisation , or inter - breeding , with domestic cats .
" Although they are quite different and have a completely different temperament , they are actually quite closely related genetically to domestic cats so they can produce fertile hybrids .
" If that continues we are going to lose our pure Scottish wildcat . "
Conservationists believe the work could help prevent another iconic species joining a long list of large predators which have been wiped out in Scotland over the last few centuries .
Douglas Richardson , of the Highland Wildlife Park at Kincraig near Aviemore , said : " We are dealing with an animal that 's the last of its kind in the British Isles .
" We formerly had lynx and other big , dangerous and interesting animals .
But this is our last feline predator and I think we are duty bound to protect it .
" There are many representatives from Scotland and the UK who are involved in conservation efforts with tigers in Asia or giant pandas in China .
" If we allow the Scottish wildcat to disappear , then the Indians , the Russians , the Chinese could quite rightly turn round and say ' Why should we bother ?
You did n't . ' "

Memorial Beads or Gang Symbol ?
Student Suspended for Wearing Rosary School leaders say the beads are a gang symbol ; student says it 's a memorial .
WASHINGTON , May 25 , 2010 -- Raymond Hosier , a 13 - year - old Schenectady , New York , boy , is gearing up to file a federal suit against his middle school after he was repeatedly suspended for wearing a rosary , which he says is in memory of his older brother who died in a bike accident .
Hosier said he has worn the rosary since September , but in the last week was suspended three times , most recently on Monday , when he arrived at school with the beads outside his shirt .
" When I wear the rosary beads , " Hosier says , " my brother 's memory is alive . "
His brother , Joey Hosier , was holding the rosary when he died .
But officials at Oneida Middle School say the district 's code of conduct clearly states that beads worn outside of the shirt are forbidden .
" Beads are often identifiers for gangs , " says Karen Corona , who handles communications for the Schenectady City School District .
" The code of conduct is entirely about keeping students safe .
Unfortunately , we live in an area where we need to do that .
We try to take every step possible to keep the displays out of school . "
Corona declined to address the specifics of Hosier 's case .
Hosier says he has worn the beads for the entire school year and was only recently asked to tuck them inside of his shirt .
When he refused , he was suspended -- twice last week and again on Monday , he says .
" I feel that it 's not right to suspend me because I have my own rights to wear my rosaries and they are taking away my religious rights to wear what I remember about my family members , " he says .
" I told them I was n't in a gang , and that purple is not a gang color . "
Hosier is being represented by the conservative American Center for Law & Justice , which has argued several cases nationally involving freedom of speech and religion .
The lawyers are planning to file a suit in federal court claiming the school violated Hosier 's constitutional rights to free speech .
In a letter to school officials the lawyers write , " Raymond 's rosary is a form of symbolic speech .
Raymond has a First Amendment right to continue to wear his Rosary to school . "
Experts on such cases believe that Raymond could well win his case .
Across the country , as schools are cracking down on gang activities , students are filing more and more challenges to protect their freedom of expression .
Critics Say Rosary Ban Defies ' Common Sense '
" There are religious liberty issues in a case like this as well as freedom of speech issues , " says Charles C. Haynes of the First Amendment Center .
" I think school districts are overreacting in banning things they think might be harmful or related to gang violence . "
Haynes says the school district has to show real evidence of a connection between the beads and gang violence and says the case becomes more of a challenge for the school when the expression in question has religious significance .
" The school has to do more than just saying it is related to gang - related activity , " Haynes says .
" They have to show that this is going to cause disruption in the school and this is a real problem in the community . "
Ed White , a lawyer representing Hosier , points out that a federal judge in Texas ruled on a similar case in 1997 .
The judge ruled in favor of students who wanted to wear glow - in - the - dark rosaries that the school thought might be gang symbols .
Last year a federal judge in New York also found against a school 's code of conduct .
" It comes to a point where you have to apply some common sense , " White says .
" Common sense is not being applied in Schenectady . "

Judd Gregg strode to the Senate floor yesterday and denounced the provision in the Dodd bill to remove derivatives from banks and put them on their own exchange in the sunlight for everyone to see .
Remarkably , he centered his argument around the irrationality of populist anger , which he likened to Argentina in the 50s and the Peron years .
You know , I have really been trying to figure out what 's behind this type of language [ derivatives sunlight ] , because it 's so destructive to our competitiveness as a nation , really .
I mean , this is the type of thing , as I said earlier , you would have seen in Argentina that -- Argentina in the 1950s -- bashing on entities simply because they 're large and because obviously there 's a populist feeling against them , which ends up , by the way , significantly affecting Main Street in a negative way .
Look at Argentina in 1945 - 1937 , somewhere in that period .
They were the seventh - best economy in the world .
7th most prosperous in the world .
Now they 're like 54th or something .
It is because of this populist movement which has driven basically their ability to be competitive offshore .
So now we have this huge populist movement here .
I 'm trying to think , what really is the rationale here other than just rampant pandering to populism ?
He follows that with this :
Is there anything in this country that gets broken up because there is an attitude that big is bad , whether it contributes or not , unless you happen to be big and union , in which case you get saved , as the UAW was able to work out for GM and Chrysler .
Senator Gregg is either arguing for a corrupt extreme right regime or he has not studied Argentina 's history lately .
Here 's a quick review .
Argentina 's economy followed other emerging countries in the early 1900s .
In 1920 , it was the 7th largest economy in the world , but the Wall Street crash took a deep toll .
Unfortunately , the 1930s witnessed a reversal in the legitimacy of the rule of law in Argentina .
To stay in power in the 1930s , the Conservatives in the Pampas resorted to electoral fraud , which neither the legislative , executive , or judicial branches checked .
The decade of unchecked electoral fraud lead to the support of citizens for the populism of President Juan Peron and the impeachment of the majority of the Supreme Court .
The aftermath of Peron has been political and economic instability , which partially accounts for the fall of Argentina from the top ten of income per capita countries in the world .

Did Senator
Gregg really intend to self - indict conservatives in our time and country by comparing today 's populist anger to Argentinian populist anger ?
There are many , many parallels between Argentine conservatives of the 1930s and American conservatives of today .
None of them are complimentary and all of them imply a severe indictment on the corruption , money and greed that seems to drive conservative legislators .
What really stands out , though , is the utter cynicism of a conservative senator criticizing populist anger while his party is spending millions upon millions to capitalize on that same populist anger .
London , England ( CNN ) --
Financial markets across the world surged while the euro strengthened against the dollar Monday , a day after Europe 's finance ministers approved a huge rescue package aimed at stabilizing the eurozone .
The Dow Jones industrial average gained 405 points , or 3.9 % , the average 's biggest one - day point and percentage gain since March 23 , 2009 .
In late afternoon trading in Europe , the Paris CAC 40 was up by almost 9 percent , while London 's FTSE 100 and the Frankfurt DAX were just short of 5 percent .
In Asia , Tokyo's Nikkei index closed up 1.6 percent , while Hong Kong 's Hang Seng advanced to 2.54 percent by the close of play .
The euro soared above $ 1.30 from $ 1.2755 on Friday .
This follows a week of heavy stock market losses for some of the EU 's member states in the wake of a massive bailout for Greece 's battered economy .
The " stabilization mechanism , " unveiled after an emergency meeting in Brussels , Belgium late Sunday , will give the 16 members of the eurozone access to loan guarantees worth at least € 440 billion ( $ 560 billion ) in an effort to prevent the fallout from Greece 's debt crisis spreading .
The International Monetary Fund will also provide up to € 220 billion ( $ 280 billion ) to the " crisis fund , " Spain 's Finance Minister Elena Salgado said Sunday .
IMF approves Greek loan
Another € 60 billion ( $ 76 billion ) would be available should member states experience " exceptional occurrences " beyond their control , Salgado said .
The European Central Bank also announced on its
Web site it would begin acquiring eurozone government and private debt " to ensure depth and liquidity in those market segments which are dysfunctional . "
German Chancellor Angela Merkel , at the forefront of negotiations over the plan , told reporters Monday that the package " serves to strengthen and protect the common currency . "
Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou told CNN the volatility in the markets did not give his country time to implement the kind of reforms its ailing economy required .
" But Europe stepped in order to regulate the markets in a way which would allow us to make these changes , " he said .
Olli Rehn , the European commissioner for economic and monetary policy , also praised the deal , saying " the fiscal efforts of European Union member states , the financial assistance by the ( European Commission ) and member states , and the actions taken today by the ( European Central Bank ) proves that we shall defend the euro whatever it takes . "
" This is Shock and Awe , Part II and in 3 - D , " Marco Annunziata , chief economist at Italian bank UniCredit Group , told Britain 's Telegraph newspaper .
" This is truly overwhelming force , and should be more than sufficient to stabilize markets in the near term , prevent panic and contain the risk of contagion . "
In Washington , U.S. President Barack Obama on Friday said he spoke with Merkel regarding economic and financial developments in Europe .
" We agreed on the importance of a strong policy response by the affected countries and a strong financial response from the international community , " he said .
" I made clear that the United States supports these efforts and will continue to cooperate with European authorities and the [ International Monetary Fund ] during this critical period . "
European Central Bank officials have tried to play down fears that the economic turmoil in Greece could spread to other heavily indebted European countries such as Spain , Portugal and Italy .
Spain saw three straight days of losses in its stock market last week after the country 's credit rating was downgraded by the influential rating agency Standard & Poor's .
Are ratings agencies credit worthy ?
However , first quarter figures showed Spain became the last major world economy to lift itself out of recession , its central bank said Friday .
" Gross domestic product grew by 0.1 percent on a quarterly basis following six consecutive quarters of contraction , " the bank said in a statement , stressing that this was only an initial estimation .
Summary time !
Jason Rohrer 's Sleep is Death is a multiplayer storytelling game .
A Controller creates and modifies a world that the Player interacts with .
I documented the Player experience in an earlier preview .
It was a great deal of fun , but why would n't it be ?
I was playing a story authored and controlled by Jason Rohrer , the dude who created the game .
Any game is fun when you 're playing it with the person who created it .
No , the real test of Sleep is Death was whether or not it would remain fun once Rohrer was out of the equation .
Whether or not it would be as intuitive and crazy and charming with me as the Controller , and some other poor bastard as the Player .
With that in mind , I tested the game with two different people : Ashly Burch ( my sister , and star of Hey Ash Whatcha Playin ' ) , and Ashley Davis ( my girlfriend , and star of Once Upon A Pixel ) .
Hit the jump to see how it went .
Sleep is Death ( PC previewed ; also available for Mac and Linux )
Developer : Jason Rohrer
Publisher : Jason Rohrer
To be released : April 9th , 2010 ( preorders only ) April 16 , 2010 ( everyone else )
I 'll get into specifics in a minute .
For now , let me just say : as much as I enjoyed playing Sleep is Death as a player in Jason Rohrer 's story , I enjoyed it even more as a Controller .
Part of that may be the weird sense of power I felt -- look , ye mortals , and despair at my ability to conjure a snack cart out of thin air -- or the fact that I was playing with people I loved .
Whatever the reason , I did n't need Jason Rohrer hovering over my virtual shoulder in order for me to enjoy the stories I controlled .
Well , maybe " controlled " is n't the right word .
Though the Controller is in charge of all the scenery changes , object movements , and art modifications , it 's not as if the Controller can ( or should , at least ) completely dictate a linear story that the Player dumbly suffers through .
I tested the same basic starting story with both Ashly Burch and Ashley Davis ( hereafter referred to as " Ash " and " Davis , " for simplicity 's sake ) , but I ended up with two completely different tales .
I wanted to create a story frame that accomplished two things .
Firstly , it had to be personally meaningful to myself , Ash , and Davis .
Secondly , the frame had to give me an opportunity to create my own art , in order to test out SiD 's sprite editor .
It was for these reasons that I created a scene based entirely around Doctor Who -- specifically , the Tenth Doctor 's regeneration . *
I planned to trick the player into thinking I 'd created a pathetic Doctor Who fanfic where they'd hang out with the Doctor and watch him regenerate , only to suddenly switch things up and reveal that they 'd simply been a fangirl who had won a contest and been given the opportunity to shoot a scene with the Doctor Who production crew .
As I 'd imagined it , this story would have combined fantastical , nerdy silliness with a depressing , down - to - earth twist .
I was totally , mindblowingly wrong about where my stories would end up .
You can download both stories from here .
Davis ' story is entitled , " Davis vs Doctor , " and Ash 's is , " Guest Starring Ashly Burch . "
I 'm not going to bother summarizing what happened in either story , so I 'd highly recommend downloading and reading them for yourself before going any further .
I 'm not sure why the game is called Sleep is Death , but it could just as easily be called " Best Laid Plans . "
I tried to imagine every direction the story could possibly go , but surprisingly , wonderfully , I could have never predicted where Ash and Davis would take my relatively bare - bones plot .
Before I get into the nuts - and - bolts of the Controller interface , it 's just worth mentioning that all the great stuff about the Player interface -- the sense of improvisation , of give - and - take , of safety and freedom -- is all present in the Controller experience .
Unless you 're a dick who refuses to allow the player to do anything they want , the Controller mode still results in wonderfully unexpected little moments of intimate brilliance .
I could have never expected Davis would want to jump her car over the dying Doctor , but I knew that , once she had , she absolutely needed to make that same jump over an exploding TARDIS .
It simply had to happen , and we both laughed our asses off when it did .
Similarly , I could n't have planned that Ash 's final words of her story would be an incomplete attempt to type " regenerate . "
There was something oddly poignant about the character she 'd created ; a girl with such an inability to distinguish fantasy from reality that in her final , dying moments , she was unable to do the very thing that her hero was known for .
Of course , Ash then fucked around some more by writing her little Porky Pig - esque coda , but even that felt hilariously appropriate .
So , yes : in terms of personal interaction and story creation , Sleep is Death is just as fun from the Controller interface , without Rohrer 's presence .
The Controller interface itself is surprisingly intuitive .
Pretty much everything is mouse - based , and , after viewing a short tutorial video by Rohrer , I was ready to start making stories by adding or removing objects , switching between scenes , and quickly editing sprites .
I had to spend about an hour or two preparing my story before my Player even connected .
Since I knew I only had thirty seconds to react to the player 's actions , I wanted to have as much stuff completed beforehand as possible .
Even though I could n't have predicted where the stories would ultimately end up , the preparation paid off : if I needed to add a regenerating Doctor or a snack cart in the middle of a story , I only needed to drag and drop them from the archive of premade objects .
Simple .
Every time you play Sleep is Death with anyone , all the sprites they used will go into your personal , searchable sprite database .
Thanks to this automatic archiving , most of the sprites I used were actually modified versions of sprites Jason Rohrer had already created : the " Ash " sprite you see in both stories , for instance , is just a female sprite Rohrer made with the hair dyed black instead of brown .
At the end of Ash 's story , the cops from my and Jason 's tale showed up and menaced her with guns .
Even if I needed to create something I had n't made beforehand , like the exploding TARDIS in Davis ' story , I could easily form new objects thanks to the game 's paper doll - esque sprite system .
Basically , every object is made up of many smaller sprites .
Even though the Tenth Doctor looks like a cohesive image everytime you see him , he 's actually made of several smaller parts : a head , a torso , and legs .
There 's no way to simply create one , large sprite of his entire body .
At first , this irritated me : I could n't find an easy way to compare the different body part sizes , so I had to keep tweaking the legs and rechecking how they looked in relation to his torso , then tweaking again , and so on .
Once I started to modify the object , however , I understood the need for the sprite separation .
If I wanted to change something small about the Tenth Doctor 's sprite -- like , say , making him stretch out his arms -- I did n't need to create an entirely new Doctor sprite from scratch .
I simply grabbed a single arm object , rotated it , and copied it twice before attaching the new arms to his torso .
Though it took me a good half - hour to get the first Doctor sprite just right , all further modifications took less than a minute each .
This meant that when it came time to animate
Ash killing herself in her story , all I had to do was flip the gun sprite 180 degrees , then copy and paste some blood splotches onto her head .
Simple , quick , and satisfying .
Of course , that does n't mean I never got overwhelmed , or that I never made any mistakes .
I screwed up more than a few times in the course of telling both stories , but hey -- no big deal .
The stories were n't ruined .
We moved on .
If I end up cloning a car or two in exchange for experiencing that wonderful sense of panic that Sleep is Death induces so effectively , that 's fine .
I 'm more than willing to make that sacrifice .
In the end , the Controller interface is pretty much everything I wanted it to be , and I do n't just mean from a technical standpoint .
Yeah , it 's intuitive , and allows for lots of creativity , and that 's great , but that 's not what is truly surprising about the Controller interface .
The Controller interface , even more so than the player interface , highlights the collaborative and improvisational aspects of a Sleep is Death play session .
While I Controlled those two stories , I was constantly making quick , profound choices about my relationship to the Player , and to my own abilities as a Controller .
Davis wanted to make her car flip over -- could I do that ?
Should I do that ?
Sure , I thought .
It 'd be hard , but it'd be worth it .
Later on , though , Davis also wanted to ram the TARDIS with her car .
I decided not to let her do that , because I thought it'd be more fun to flip her car over an explosion .
The Controller engages in a constant , intense back - and - forth with the player where nothing is certain and , if the Controller is willing , damn near anything can happen .
In fact , I was really worried that I simply would n't know what to create in Sleep is Death .
When it comes to user - generated content , I 'm not a particularly creative guy : my Spore creatures were all boring , and I never made a full LittleBigPlanet level in the entire time I had it .
Sleep is Death , however , elicits a totally different type of creativity ; you do n't have to be a level design genius or a creative mastermind to get something useful out of a story , because you 'll always have someone else to react off .
I did n't have to worry about creating an objectively awesome series of levels or situations when I had people like Ashley Davis deciding to turn my story into a stunt spectacular .
Even though my " you 're a guest star on a TV show " plot was kind of dull , Ashly Burch 's involvement turned it into something spectacularly funny , and cool , and personal .
I would have never , ever expected that Ash 's playthrough of my story would end with her dying and the Tenth Doctor regenerating at the exact same time , but that 's exactly what did happen .
And that 's fucking incredible .
* If you do n't watch Doctor Who , just know that the Doctor is a character who , when dying , will completely change his appearance and personality in order to save himself .
Ash and I both cried like little bitches when the most recent Doctor regenerated .
Zimbabwe 143 for 7 ( Chigumbura 49 * ) beat Pakistan 131 ( Utseya 4 - 15 ) by 12 runs
Scorecard
The defending champions , Pakistan , slumped to an embarrassing 12 - run defeat at the hands of a buoyant Zimbabwe , who followed up their thrilling one - run victory over Australia with another impressive scalp at St Lucia .
At 64 for 5 in the 12th over , Zimbabwe looked unlikely to reprise their heroics of the opening warm - up match , but Elton Chigumbura lived up to his pre-tournament reputation with a hard - hitting 49 not out from 35 balls , to hoist the total to a defendable 143 for 7 .
In reply , Kamran Akmal started full of intent with 37 from 27 balls , but Pakistan kept shipping wickets from the opposite end , as they slipped to 67 for 5 after 10 overs .
Fawad Alam and Misbah - ul - Haq then added 51 in in 7.4 overs for the sixth wicket , before being stopped in their tracks by Prosper Utseya , who extracted both men in the space of three deliveries , en route to figures of 4 for 15 in four overs .
Pakistan tumbled from 118 for 5 to 124 for 9 , and it was left to Chigumbura to apply the coup de grace , as he finished with figures of 3 for 16 in three overs , and Zimbabwe 's second win in consecutive warm - up matches .

The Archbishop of Canterbury has expressed his " deep sorrow " for any difficulties caused by his comments about the Catholic Church in Ireland .
His claim that the Church had lost all credibility because of its handling of child abuse by priests was criticised by both Catholic and Anglican clergy .
The Catholic Archbishop of Dublin , Diarmuid Martin , said he was " stunned " .
Dr Rowan Williams later telephoned Archbishop Martin to insist he meant no offence to the Irish Catholic Church .
BBC religious affairs correspondent Robert Pigott said Dr Williams ' words represented unusually damning criticism from the leader of another Church .
He made his comments about the scandal in an interview to be broadcast on BBC Radio 4's Start the Week programme .
ANALYSIS Robert Pigott , BBC religious affairs correspondent Rowan Williams ' assessment of the Roman Catholic Church in Ireland as having lost all credibility is unusually blunt and damning .
It should be remembered that relations between the two Churches have been strained since Pope Benedict offered disgruntled Anglicans easy conversion to Catholicism last October .
But Dr Williams ' remarks do reflect a growing sense of alarm at what is perceived to be the Catholic Church 's disastrous loss of moral authority .
His comments will strike a chord with increasing numbers of people who feel the Vatican has yet to realise , let alone accept , the seriousness of the plight it shares with the Church in Ireland .
While it is very unusual for one Church leader to make such comments about another , Dr Williams will feel the Roman Catholic Church in Ireland and the UK's Anglican Churches are fighting the same battle against secularism and the erosion of Christian influence and status .
On the most important weekend in the Christian calendar , when the Church is supposed to be talking about renewal , it faces a real crisis which Dr Williams believes needs to be sorted out .
Dr Williams said : " I was speaking to an Irish friend recently who was saying that it 's quite difficult in some parts of Ireland to go down the street wearing a clerical collar now .
" And an institution so deeply bound into the life of a society , suddenly becoming , suddenly losing all credibility - that 's not just a problem for the Church , it is a problem for everybody in Ireland . "
The Archbishop of Dublin said those working to renew the Church did not need the remarks .
He said : " I still shudder when I think of the harm that was caused to abused children .
I recognise that their Church failed them .
" I also journey with those - especially parents and priests - who work day by day to renew the Catholic Church in this diocese and who are committed to staying with their Church and passing on the faith in wearying times .
" Archbishop Williams ' comments will be for them immensely disheartening and will challenge their faith even further , " he said .
The Church in Ireland said the issue of abuse was being taken " very seriously " .
Last month , Pope Benedict XVI apologised to all victims of child sex abuse by Catholic priests in Ireland .
He has also rebuked Irish bishops for " grave errors of judgement " in dealing with the problem .
It should be remembered that the archbishop has neither experience of Irish life nor any direct ecclesiastical authority in this country .
I hope that he will reflect on his comments , and I deeply regret the hurt that he has caused
Bishop of Meath and Kildare , Richard Clarke
Cleric 's apology to abuse victims Church of Ireland Archbishop of Dublin Dr John Neill - a senior figure in Ireland 's Anglican communion - said he had listened to the remarks of Dr Williams with " deep regret " .
" As one who ... acknowledges the pain and deep suffering of the victims of abuse , I also feel for the countless priests and bishops who daily live out their Christian vocation , " he added .
Fellow Anglican the Most Revd Richard Clarke , Bishop of Meath and Kildare , said Dr Williams ' remarks were " careless and reckless " and " deeply hurtful " .
" As those of us who live in this country know very well , most bishops , priests and religious of the Roman Catholic tradition minister faithfully and selflessly under very difficult conditions with the love and support of their people , " he added .
But Catherine Pepinster , editor of Catholic weekly newspaper The Tablet said Rowan Williams ' comments were " very striking " and that many Catholics would share his opinion .
Vows of silence Dr Williams ' comments came after Pope Benedict 's personal preacher , the Rev Raniero Cantalamessa , compared criticism of the pontiff and Church over child abuse to " collective violence " suffered by the Jews .
Speaking at Good Friday prayers in St Peter 's Basilica , Father Cantalamessa quoted a Jewish friend as saying the accusations reminded him of the " more shameful aspects of anti-Semitism " .
The Vatican said this was not its official position and the comments were criticised by Jewish groups and those representing abuse victims .
On Sunday , Cardinal Keith O'Brien , the head of the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland , is expected to apologise during his Easter address in Edinburgh to the victims of paedophile priests .
The Start the Week programme will be broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Monday at 0900BST .

At the end of this month the United States Trade Representative 's Office will release its annual Special 301 report , a review of global intellectual property protection and enforcement standards conducted by the Office of the United States Trade Representative ( USTR ) .
Since 1989 , the USTR has used the Special 301 Report to intimidate other countries into adopting more stringent copyright and patent laws by singling out particular countries for their " bad " intellectual property policies , naming them on a tiered set of " watch lists , " resulting in heightened political pressure and in some cases , the potential for trade sanctions , to encourage changes to their laws .
In previous years , the USTR has relied heavily on submissions from the entertainment and pharmaceutical industries to compile the rankings for the Special 301 report .
This has resulted in particularly unbalanced assessment criteria .
Countries have been listed for proposing exceptions to their national copyright laws , for failing to sign on to controversial international treaties , and for not mirroring specific parts of US law in their national laws .
In other words , countries have been listed for failing to adopt the enforcement norms from U.S. copyright law , but also for attempting to create the same type of balancing exceptions and limitations to copyright holders ' exclusive rights that have allowed user generated content and technological innovation to flourish in the U.S .
In 2006 , the IIPA recommended that Chile be placed on the Special 301 Priority Watch List ( a tier above the " Watch List " ranking ) for considering fair - use style exceptions to copyright in Chile 's copyright law :
During 2005 , several Chilean government agencies reportedly were trying to amend the bill to incorporate very broad " fair use - like " exceptions which would allow copyrighted materials to be used without the rights - holders ' authorizations .
It is likely that these provisions , if included , would also meet with the objections of the copyright industries .
In 2009 , Israel was placed on the Priority Watch List for refusing to adopt DMCA - style laws prohibiting the circumvention of copyright owners ' technological protection measures ( TPMs ) after intense parliamentary debate and doubts about whether DMCA - style anticircumvention provisions actually do anything to stop copyright infringement .
This is an astute question , given that in the US , those provisions have caused considerable collateral harm to lawful users of copyrighted works while having no appreciable effect at stopping , or even slowing , digital copyright infringement .
Again , this is not a matter of compliance with international law as it is frequently portrayed to be .
Israel has chosen not to ratify the controversial 1996 WIPO Copyright Treaty and WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty , and so is not required to adopt legal protection for copyright owners ' technological protection measures .
In 2006 , Canada was subjected to an Out of Cycle Review ( because the USTR thought the country merited special attention outside the normal Special 301 schedule ) after it released draft copyright legislation implementing those treaties that included legal protection for TPMs , but not close enough to the DMCA to satisfy the US copyright owners in the IIPA .
And Canada drew the ire of the USTR again in 2009 , for requiring its customs officers to have a court order before seizing items at the border — something that ACTA looks like it will overturn .
As EFF noted in our joint submission with Public Knowledge , Special 301 neglects critical US foreign policy goals .
The policies it advocates ignore the importance of the free flow of information for social and economic development , and the the need to support US technology exporters seeking new markets .
We argued that the Special 301 process should account for the interests of all stakeholders in the knowledge economy -- not just IP rights - holders .
We also made a number of specific recommendations for addressing the procedural deficiencies in the Special 301 process , including that the USTR should make transparent the set of factors and standards it uses for evaluating countries in each year 's Special 301 Report , and arrange for independent external verification of country data and statistics submitted by the IIPA before making factual determinations based upon it ; and that the USTR should provide a meaningful opportunity for public interest advocates to file comments in response to submissions provided by copyright industry rights - holders .
The USTR opened up the Special 301 submission process this year to all interested stakeholders for the first time and received over 700 submissions .
While we welcome this new approach by the Obama administration , the real test for sound policy - making will be whether the 2010 Special 301 Report takes account of the views of all stakeholders .
We 'll find out shortly .
American troops in Afghanistan riddled a passenger bus with bullets outside Kandahar on Monday , killing four civilians and galvanizing anti-Western sentiment just as NATO is gearing up for a massive military offensive in and around the southern city .
Angry protests erupted after the shooting in Zhari district , to the west of Kandahar , which also left 18 people hurt .
NATO ’s International Security Assistance Force said it “ deeply regrets the tragic loss of life ” in the shootings , and it promised a speedy joint investigation with Afghan authorities .
Tensions have been running high before the planned Western push to expel the Taliban from Kandahar , which the insurgents consider their spiritual home .
Coalition troops , mainly Americans and Canadians , have been trying to clear and control major roads near the city -- a task that leaves them vulnerable to vehicle - borne suicide bombers and so - called improvised explosive devices , or IEDs .
Civilians , in turn , risk being mistaken for a threat by the Western forces if they drive erratically or stray too close to military convoys .
The early - morning shooting occurred after a crowded bus traveling on the main highway out of Kandahar came up behind several slow - moving Western military vehicles that were engaged in road clearing , said Zalmai Ayubi , a spokesman for the governor of Kandahar province .
Under what NATO calls “ escalation of force ” rules , troops are ordered to use nonlethal means when possible to prevent a suspicious vehicle from getting too close .
Military officials said troops tried to signal the driver to stop , using flares , flashlights and hand signals .
With the bus gathering speed instead of slowing , the troops opened fire on it , according to the military ’s account -- realizing only afterward that the vehicle was a passenger bus .
As word of the shootings spread , protests broke out on the city ’s outskirts .
Witnesses said demonstrators burned tires on the main road and shouted slogans condemning both the United States and President Hamid Karzai .
NATO did not acknowledge that the troops involved were Americans , but local officials and a Western military official , speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the event , described them as U.S. forces .
The timing of the incident is particularly sensitive , coming as U.S. officials are trying to persuade Karzai to lend his full support to the Kandahar offensive .
The Afghan leader issued a statement in which he strongly condemned the shooting and offered condolences to families of the dead and injured .
Last week , Karzai , who is from a village outside Kandahar , attended a shura , or tribal gathering , in the company of U.S. Army Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal .
There , he assured elders that the campaign would not be conducted without their backing .
American officials insist that Karzai ’s wishes will be paramount as planning of the offensive goes forward .
In practical terms , however , the offensive is already something of a juggernaut .
Nearly half of the 30,000 additional troops President Obama ordered sent here have already arrived , and most are being deployed in the south .
McChrystal himself has described the operation as already underway .
Karzai has been a harsh critic of civilian casualties at the hands of coalition troops .
Insurgents last year were responsible for about three - quarters of the noncombatant deaths , according to U.N. figures , but deaths and injuries attributed to Western forces tend to be far more politically explosive .
On the eve of February ’s U.S. Marine - led offensive in Marja , in Helmand province , the Afghan leader gave what seemed to be only a grudging endorsement of the campaign , emphasizing that civilian lives must be safeguarded .
Adding to a growing sense of chaos in Kandahar , three would - be suicide bombers launched an abortive attack on an intelligence services compound about six hours after the bus shooting , officials said .
One of the bombers was captured , one blew himself up and the other was shot to death by police .

It was exciting to see Bret Taylor ( who I had the pleasure to work with at Google ) do such a great job on stage , and with the platform .
There are many implications that will ripple out from this news , and here are some of my thoughts :
Act One : Security
At JSConf , Doug Crockford came out in his talk , asking to do an ECMAScript 4 to HTML5 .
Stop it .
Block it .
Go back to the table and fix the Web security model .
He must have had a giggle when he saw the new Facebook “ Like ” button .
It allows anyone to throw a Facebook like on any page .
I quickly put it up on Ajaxian :
< iframe src = " http://www.facebook.com/plugins/like.php?href=<?php echo urlencode ( get_permalink ( ) ) ; ?> & layout=standard & show - faces=true & width=450 & action=like & colorscheme=dark " scrolling =" no " frameborder= " 0 " allowTransparency =" true " style= " border : none ; overflow : hidden ; width : 450 px ; height:30 px ; padding - top:8 px " > </ iframe >
Note how you pass in the href of what you want to like .
I am getting the URL for each post and plugging it in .
However , you could put any URL in there , as folks quickly discovered .
Is n’t it fun to have a like button on content that actually likes some XXX porn .
You like innocuous content X , and your wife looks at your stream to see that you are into a dirty movie .
As soon as you iframe in the world of Facebook , the page in question gets the power to get content into your graph and stream .
Ouch .
Not good .
The UI should at the very least see if it is liking a URL that is n’t the same as the main window.location .
If it is exactly the same page , when you hover on “ Like ” it could say “ this exact page ” .
If it is on the same domain it could say “ a page on this site ” , and if it is n’t on the domain … .
ALERT ALERT ALERT .
Since Facebook knows who you are , why not even let me set what I want to do here ?
It is also frustrating that I could n’t easily change the look and feel .
Neither “ light ” or “ dark ” themes work on Ajaxian for example .
I hope that power user features are added , so you can set the colors for various elements without having to go low level and do everything from scratch .
Act Two : Owning My Data
When I look at how we add the “ Like ” in the browser , we see the code smell of an iframe to an external site .
We see this in other forms too , such as script tags pointing to Google to get a Google Map .
This feels utterly wrong to me .
Instead of a code snippet that points to a particular service , I want to declare what I want to see .
In the case of “ like ” , let me just say something such as :
< div class = " data - like " > </div >
Then some JavaScript could come in and augment this to be the iframe , OR the right thing could happen .
The browser itself could take over and understand the semantic meaning here .
Imagine if around the Web we had :
< div class = " map loc: xxx , yyy " > </div >
Rather than the Google Maps , Bing Maps , Yahoo !
Maps snippets .
If a cool new maps startup came along , I could change my maps provider in my browser , and ALL maps would be shown using the provider of my choice .
Much better .
I want to see the same for “ Like ” and other social data .
The browser could then know what services to ping with the like .
For example , perform a “ like ” on Facebook , a retweet on Twitter , and a bookmark .
That data could be stored locally , and I am assured that I can always have it .
This leads me to Michael Hanson , principal engineer at Mozilla Labs .
Mike and I did n’t even get a chance to really overlap at Mozilla , but I met him before I left .
He is a killer engineer , and someone who is going to have a profound effect on the state of identity for us all .
His early work , in alpha-ish stage , is around the notion of contacts in the browser .
This add - on is fantastic .
Contacts are consumed from Yahoo ! , Facebook , Google , etc ( a la Palm webOS Synergy ) and people are first class citizens ( e.g. person : [ email protected ] , person : http://facebook.com/btaylor ) .
With type = ” email ” you can auto complete of your friends .
He already uses the new Facebook Graph API which is a dream to use compared to the old REST / FQL .
I hope it is more solid too .
Anyway , these are just a few of Mike ’s features .
Firefox is about to get very social .
So , the browser should be the universal like machine .
Not Facebook .
Not a service owned by a company .
You .
Your browser .
You own your data .
Facebook continues to change your privacy policy , and the EFF just spoke out again : Facebook Further Reduces Your Control Over Personal Information .
Some claim that ad companies do this and more already , tying it together sneakily on the backend ….
but changing your privacy and making it OPT - OUT is terrible .
Act Three : Performance
Alex Sexton pointed out the performance side of a like button :
From what i can tell , a single facebook like button requires at least 12 unique requests and ~ 1 second of load time .
The button adds ~ 161 new http requests to this page on Levis which is ~ 4sec Compare the difference in when onload kicks in via iframe compared to via JS .
Time for Steve Souders to do a P3P ? :)
Again , if the browser handled the notion of like , we would n’t have this issue .
Also , what if instead of a million iframes , we all loaded one set of JavaScript from Facebook , and there was a JavaScript function that would let us put the like content into a div .
To optimize , we could pass in the set of URLs to ONE JavaScript function and get one set of metadata back .
Then we have a function that adds the right HTML to a div .
No matter how many like buttons you have .
One request .
We could go the OpenLike route , but we do n’t want a huge list of buttons and another resource to deal with .
Let the browser do it .
We do n’t need to see a world of this .
It is broken .
Time to wake up :
Chris Messina has some words on the subject too :
If some guy walked up to me on the street and said , " Hey , I 've got a really cool Batman haircut .
Wanna see ? "
Like most people , I would think he 's crazy .
Then , as soon as said weird guy turned around to show me the Dark Knight 's silhouette carved perfectly into his otherwise shaved head , I would become a believer .
A terrified believer that would run away instantly , only to find myself at the mercy of weird Bat - Hair guy's war against people with significantly less cool haircuts .
In all seriousness , the unidentified kid in this photograph sports the single nerdiest ( and greatest ) haircut I have ever seen in public .
The best part of the picture is the way the mother and her child at the counter are staring straight at Bat - Hair with expressions that are equal parts admiration and ridicule .
It 's as if they can see straight through his face and directly at the Caped Crusader worn on the back of his head .
Priceless !
Actually , wait a minute ... we can't see this kid 's face .
Given his willingness to wear Batman on the back of his head , who knows what the heck Bat - Hair has on his face !
A full facial tattoo of the Joker , perhaps ?
A massive Bat insignia ?!
The possibilities are as endless as they are awesome !!

WASHINGTON -- Nearly 80 percent of Americans say they can't trust Washington and they have little faith that the massive federal bureaucracy can solve the nation 's ills , according to a survey from the Pew Research Center that shows public confidence in the federal government at one of the lowest points in a half - century .
The poll released Sunday illustrates the ominous situation facing President Barack Obama and the Democratic Party as they struggle to maintain their comfortable congressional majorities in this fall 's elections .
Midterm prospects are typically tough for the party in power .
Add a toxic environment like this and lots of incumbent Democrats could be out of work .
The survey found that just 22 percent of those questioned say they can trust Washington almost always or most of the time and just 19 percent say they are basically content with it .
Nearly half say the government negatively effects their daily lives , a sentiment that 's grown over the past dozen years .
This anti-government feeling has driven the tea party movement , reflected in fierce protests this past week .
" The government 's been lying to people for years .
Politicians make promises to get elected , and when they get elected , they do n't follow through , " says Cindy Wanto , 57 , a registered Democrat from Pennsylvania who joined several thousand for a rally in Washington on April 15 -- the tax filing deadline .
" There 's too much government in my business .
It was a problem before Obama , but he 's certainly not helping fix it . "
Majorities in the survey call Washington too big and too powerful , and say it 's interfering too much in state and local matters .
The public is split over whether the government should be responsible for dealing with critical problems or scaled back to reduce its power , presumably in favor of personal responsibility .
About half say they want a smaller government with fewer services , compared with roughly 40 percent who want a bigger government providing more .
The public was evenly divided on those questions long before Obama was elected .
Still , a majority supported the Obama administration exerting greater control over the economy during the recession .
" Trust in government rarely gets this low , " said Andrew Kohut , director of the nonpartisan center that conducted the survey .
" Some of it 's backlash against Obama .
But there are a lot of other things going on . "
And , he added : " Politics has poisoned the well . "
The survey found that Obama 's policies were partly to blame for a rise in distrustful , anti-government views .
In his first year in office , the president orchestrated a government takeover of Detroit automakers , secured a $ 787 billion stimulus package and pushed to overhaul the health care system .
But the poll also identified a combination of factors that contributed to the electorate 's hostility : the recession that Obama inherited from President George W. Bush ; a dispirited public ; and anger with Congress and politicians of all political leanings .
" I want an honest government .
This is n't an honest government .
It has n't been for some time , " said self - described independent David Willms , 54 , of Florida .
He faulted the White House and Congress under both parties .
The poll was based on four surveys done from March 11 to April 11 on landline and cell phones .
The largest survey , of 2,500 adults , has a margin of sampling error of 2.5 percentage points ; the others , of about 1,000 adults each , has a margin of sampling error of 4 percentage points .
In the short term , the deepening distrust is politically troubling for Obama and Democrats .
Analysts say out - of - power Republicans could well benefit from the bitterness toward Washington come November , even though voters blame them , too , for partisan gridlock that hinders progress .
In a democracy built on the notion that citizens have a voice and a right to exercise it , the long - term consequences could prove to be simply unhealthy -- or truly debilitating .
Distrust could lead people to refuse to vote or get involved in their own communities .
Apathy could set in , or worse -- violence .
Democrats and Republicans both accept responsibility and fault the other party for the electorate 's lack of confidence .
" This should be a wake - up call .
Both sides are guilty , " said Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill .
She pointed to " nonsense " that goes on during campaigns that leads to " promises made but not promises kept . "
Still , she added : " Distrust of government is an all - American activity .
It 's something we do as Americans and there 's nothing wrong with it . "
Sen. Scott Brown , a Republican who won a long - held Democratic Senate seat in Massachusetts in January by seizing on public antagonism toward Washington , said : " It 's clear Washington is broken .
There 's too much partisan bickering to be able to solve the problems people want us to solve . "
And , he added : " It 's going to be reflected in the elections this fall . "
But Matthew Dowd , a top strategist on Bush 's re-election campaign who now shuns the Republican label , says both Republicans and Democrats are missing the mark .
" What the country wants is a community solution to the problems but not necessarily a federal government solution , " Dowd said .
Democrats are emphasizing the federal government , while Republicans are saying it's about the individual ; neither is emphasizing the right combination to satisfy Americans , he said .
Retailers came under increased pressure today to take sexualised clothing for young girls off their shelves , after it emerged that shoes for eight - year - olds with three - inch heels were being sold on the high street .
A survey by the Guardian found an array of items available in major chains , from a T - shirt for a three - year - old bearing the slogan " Future WAG " to a top for a toddler with a pink bikini appliqued on the front .
New Look sells a range of high heels starting at size one – about the shoe size of an average eight - year - old – including a pair of £ 16 dark blue platforms with a 3.5 inch heel , pointed toe and four straps .
Justine Roberts , of the parenting website Mumsnet , called for the shoes to be withdrawn from sale , describing them as horrific .
" They 're totally inappropriate for an eight - year - old , " she said .
" Aside from the issues of young girls dressing to look like sexually available women , heels as high as this are all wrong for growing feet . "
Mumsnet recently launched its Let Girls Be Girls campaign , calling on retailers to sign up to a pledge not to sell products that sexualise children .
Roberts also objected to a pair of glittery silver shoes with a 1.5 - inch heel sold by Next in a size 12 , apparently aimed at six or seven - year - olds .
" They look pretty adult or sexual , " she said .
" Why a 1.5 - inch heel for a six - year - old ?
It just seems unnecessary . "
Mumsnet members have criticised the " Future WAG " T - shirt available in Primark .
" Personally , I know I want my daughter to aspire to something more than being a WAG – basically , someone who usually relies on her looks to get a rich man and then spends years of her life trying to keep that man happy , " one wrote online .
Others described the top as " tragic " .
Anna van Heeswijk , of Object , which campaigns against the sexual objectification of women , said : " What does it say about how our society values women and girls , if we are grooming three - to four - year - olds to aspire to be a footballer 's wife ? "
The latest outcry comes after a week in which Primark announced it was to stop selling padded bikini tops for children as young as seven , after criticism .
The company , which came under fire from children 's charities and politicians over the £ 4 bikini sets , apologised to customers and said it would donate any profits it had made to child welfare organisations .
David Cameron branded the sale of the bikinis " disgraceful " , and Gordon Brown backed the campaign to have them removed .
Yesterday Roberts described a T - shirt for a two - to three - year - old sold by the chain showing a bikini as " creepy " , but did not call for it to be withdrawn .
" It does seem a bit odd , " she said .
" I 'm wearing a picture of my underwear – what 's that all about ? "
One mother of a four - year - old girl shopping in the chain 's Oxford Street branch , who did not want to be named , said it was " too old for a little girl .
A bikini is for teenagers or adults .
You 'd expect a more childish image for a two - year - old . "
Van Heeswijk said : " These clothes are a worrying example of how girls are being groomed at younger and younger ages to fit into a sex - object culture , in which women are viewed as a sum of body parts , always sexually available , and whose value lies in how sexy they look to boys and men . "
Early sexualisation is damaging to the aspirations of women and girls and affects how boys and men view and treat them , she added , with implications for incidents of sexual harassment and violence .
" The early sexualisation of girls is not harmless , and , if we are serious about achieving genuine equality between women and men , it is time to put an end to women and girls being viewed , treated , portrayed and groomed into sexual objects through clothing ranges like these , " she said .
Penny Nicholls , of the Children 's Society , said : " There is a big distinction between children dressing up for fun and retailers producing items of clothing that target children and encourage premature sexualisation .
" We have to ask what effects some of these products have on children and young people 's ideas of body image and what is appropriate for their age .
Retailers and adults have a responsibility to ensure children and young people grow up valuing the right things in themselves and other people .
" Unless we question our own behaviour as a society , we risk creating a generation who are left unfulfilled through chasing unattainable and inappropriate lifestyles and values . "
Primark said : " The company has stated that it will review all its product lines in the light of recent events . "
New Look declined to comment .
Next said it had received no direct complaints about the shoes or suggestions they should be removed from sale .
" But we 'll definitely act swiftly if customers tell us they consider it inappropriate , " a spokeswoman said .
" Everyone at Next is sensitive to issues of age appropriateness within childrenswear . "
A new cloud of volcanic ash was headed toward Britain on Tuesday , increasing the uncertainty about the prompt return of air traffic to parts of the British Isles , according to the organization that controls air traffic in the area .
“ The volcano eruption in Iceland has strengthened , and a new ash cloud is spreading south and east toward the U.K. , ” the British National Air Traffic Services , or NATS , said in a statement posted on its Web site early Tuesday .
“ This demonstrates the dynamic and rapidly changing conditions in which we are working . ”
On Monday , European officials announced that all European airspace would be opened to air traffic above elevations of 20,000 feet .
Below 20,000 feet , NATS said on Monday afternoon , Scottish airspace might reopen Tuesday morning and that restrictions over England and Wales , including the London area , might be lifted later in the day .
But on Tuesday the agency said flights were being permitted in Scotland and parts of England , but not as far south as the main London airports .
It 's a map and it is surprising !
Interestingly enough , godless liberal Midwestern enclave Iowa is the only state where you can get a homo - dog marriage but not a convenient and family - reunion - airfare - cost - efficient cousin marriage .
Also , note the states ( Arkansas , Indiana , Kansas , Louisiana , Nebraska , Oklahoma , Washington , West Virginia , and Wyoming ) that wo n't perform a cousin wedding but will recognize it if you do it elsewhere .
These are states that do n't do the same thing for gay unions .
Whee , terrific America !
States rights in a globalized world .

I just invented a new game , you guys .
Here ’s how you play :
Take a movie none of us are going to see ( The Last Song , adapted from the Nicholas Sparks novel , starring Miley Cyrus , Liam Hemsworth , and Greg Kinnear ) , then , try to recreate the plot using only exposition from the horrible reviews it ’s getting .
Ready ?
Let ’s go !
Kinnear ’s character , we ’re told , fell asleep at the chapel piano one night and may have caused a painful fire , so he ’s living with guilt and secrets and struggling to re-engage with Ronnie .
– Chicago Tribune
Ronnie never misses an opportunity to make dad feel bad for splitting up with her mom ( Kelly Preston ) .
She ’s so spiteful that she has n’t touched a piano in years and refuses to attend Juilliard , which has accepted her on the basis of her reputation .
– Boston Globe
… despite the concerns of her mother that Ronnie barely graduated high school and “ failed her SATs . ” – USA Today
She ’s still smarting from her parents ’ divorce and nursing a major attitude .
This means ignoring her acceptance to Juilliard , and befriending kids who spend all night partying under the boardwalk .
– NYDailyNews
She does this on an idyllic island paradise off Savannah , Georgia , where her dad is a classical composer whose pastime is restoring stained - glass windows .
She blames her dad for the divorce , is sullen and withdrawn .
Ten minutes after she hits the beach ( dressed in Gothic black ) , her milk shake is spilled by a flying volleyball player named Will ( Liam Hemsworth ) .
– Roger Ebert
In addition to the terminal illness ( signaled by a telltale cough around the movie ’s midpoint ) , there is a church fire that Ronnie ’s dad is believed to have started , a wayward friend with a bad boyfriend , another friend with a dead brother , a nest of sea turtle eggs menaced by a raccoon , and a romance — did I mention it was star - crossed ?
– NY Times
Two things soften Ronnie ’s hard shell .
She discovers a sea turtle nest and vows to protect it from raccoons .
And she meets a boy .
– Detroit Free Press
Though a blond ex-girlfriend and the hero ’s snobbish mother try to split them , we know they ’ve bonded over her trying to help sea turtles hatch on the beach .
– NY Post
There 's nothing sexier than a drawing of a hot girl , amirite ?
Wrong .
That was a test and you failed you little hentai - loving horndog , you .
Your shame aside , this is a little gallery of Star Wars pin-up / Galactic Empire propaganda posters as imagined by illustrator Feng Zhu .
Because nothing makes men want to join a fighting force like pictures of hot girls , amirite ?
Wrong again .
Guys join fighting forces with the hopes of firing lasers at other people 's faces .
It 's true , even it they do n't want to admit it because they want to seem like the quiet , gentle type that deserves to be in your pants .
SNAP -- consider yourself cock - blocked , son !
Hit the jump for seven more of the commie propaganda .
Star Wars Pin-Ups [ theswedishbed ]
Thanks to Andreas , who joined the Empire after the promise of cake .
Works every time .
Moscow , Idaho gets all the fun humanist billboards .
But this one may be my favorite :
“ This billboard nicely sums up two of the main messages of the American Humanist Association , ” said Roy Speckhardt , executive director of the AHA .
“ First , that you do n’t have to believe in God to be good — in fact , humanists and other nontheists see being good as one of the most important of responsibilities in our one and only life .
Second , that church and state should remain separate for the benefit of us all . ”
Speckhardt argued that “ In Good We Trust ” is a more inclusive and appropriate sentiment than the “ In God We Trust ” motto , which runs afoul the First Amendment .
…
David Niose , president of the American Humanist Association , pointed out that the official national motto had an unsavory beginning .
“ The adoption of the ‘ In God We Trust ’ motto came at the height of the Cold War and McCarthyism in the 1950s , and it is unfortunate that we still cling to such religious rhetoric today .
E pluribus unum , the Latin phrase for ‘ out of many , one , ’ would be a much more appropriate motto .
It reflects the true character of American society and government . ”
According to the AHA ’s press release , the billboard can be seen on Highway 95 , “ just south of Moscow near the Sweet Avenue cross street , facing northbound traffic . ”
The billboard is a wonderfully simple concept .
It ’s an idea anyone can get behind … unless you ’re deluded enough to think that we can only be good if we believe in a god ( a proposition that is so easily disprovable ) .
Ironically , it ’s probably someone from that group who will inevitably vandalize this billboard .
I hope it does n’t happen , but for some reason , the “ moral , God- fearing ” people are the same ones who ca n’t seem to stand any challenge to their beliefs .
A previously postponed welterweight rematch between Jon Fitch and Thiago Alves will now take place at UFC 115 on June 12 at the GM Place in Vancouver , British Columbia , Canada , according to a post made Sunday on UFC President Dana White ’s Twitter account .
Alves could n’t get medically cleared to face Fitch at UFC 111 on March 27 due to an irregularity in his pre-fight neurological exam .
The 26 - year - old Brazilian underwent a successful surgical procedure last week to correct the condition .
Fitch , 32 , fought last - minute replacement Ben Saunders , a teammate of Alves , at UFC 111 and won the bout by unanimous decision .
American Kickboxing Academy ’s Fitch earned a second - round technical knockout over Alves at UFC Fight Night 5 in June 2006 .
Fitch and Alves sit at the No. 2 and 3 spots on Sherdog.com ’s official rankings .
Regression analysis .
It sounds like a part of Freudian psychology .
In reality , a regression is a seemingly ubiquitous statistical tool appearing in legions of scientific papers , and regression analysis is a method of measuring the link between two or more phenomena .
Imagine you want to know the connection between the square footage of houses and their sale prices .
A regression charts such a link , in so doing pinpointing “ an average causal effect , ” as MIT economist Josh Angrist and his co-author Jorn - Steffen Pischke of the London School of Economics put it in their 2009 book , “ Mostly Harmless Econometrics . ”
To grasp the basic concept , take the simplest form of a regression : a linear , bivariate regression , which describes an unchanging relationship between two ( and not more ) phenomena .
Now suppose you are wondering if there is a connection between the time high school students spend doing French homework , and the grades they receive .
These types of data can be plotted as points on a graph , where the x-axis is the average number of hours per week a student studies , and the y - axis represents exam scores out of 100 .
Together , the data points will typically scatter a bit on the graph .
The regression analysis creates the single line that best summarizes the distribution of points .
Mathematically , the line representing a simple linear regression is expressed through a basic equation : Y = a 0 + a 1 X . Here X is hours spent studying per week , the “ independent variable . ”
Y is the exam scores , the “ dependent variable , ” since — we believe — those scores depend on time spent studying .
Additionally , a 0 is the y - intercept ( the value of Y when X is zero ) and a 1 is the slope of the line , characterizing the relationship between the two variables .
Using two slightly more complex equations , the “ normal equations ” for the basic linear regression line , we can plug in all the numbers for X and Y , solve for a 0 and a 1 , and actually draw the line .
That line often represents the lowest aggregate of the squares of the distances between all points and itself , the “ Ordinary Least Squares ” ( OLS ) method mentioned in mountains of academic papers .
To see why OLS is logical , imagine a regression line running 6 units below one data point and 6 units above another point ; it is 6 units away from the two points , on average .
Now suppose a second line runs 10 units below one data point and 2 units above another point ; it is also 6 units away from the two points , on average .
But if we square the distances involved , we get different results : 62 + 62 = 72 in the first case , and 102 + 22 = 104 in the second case .
So the first line yields the lower figure — the “ least squares ” — and is a more consistent reduction of the distance from the data points .
( Additional methods , besides OLS , can find the best line for more complex forms of regression analysis . )
In turn , the typical distance between the line and all the points ( sometimes called the “ standard error ” ) indicates whether the regression analysis has captured a relationship that is strong or weak .
The closer a line is to the data points , overall , the stronger the relationship .
Regression analysis , again , establishes a correlation between phenomena .
But as the saying goes , correlation is not causation .
Even a line that fits the data points closely may not say something definitive about causality .
Perhaps some students do succeed in French class because they study hard .
Or perhaps those students benefit from better natural linguistic abilities , and they merely enjoy studying more , but do not especially benefit from it .
Perhaps there would be a stronger correlation between test scores and the total time students had spent hearing French spoken before they ever entered this particular class .
The tale that emerges from good data may not be the whole story .
So it still takes critical thinking and careful studies to locate meaningful cause - and - effect relationships in the world .
But at a minimum , regression analysis helps establish the existence of connections that call for closer investigation .
Julius Malema sends a BBC journalist out of a press conference Reuters
A firebrand South African youth leader today threw a BBC journalist out of a press conference , accusing him of " white tendency " and calling him a " bastard " , " bloody agent " and " small boy " .
Julius Malema , president of the youth wing of the African National Congress , exploded in rage when Jonah Fisher , a white Briton , interrupted him at the ANC 's headquarters in Johannesburg .
The row began when Malema , who has just returned from Zimbabwe , praised Robert Mugabe 's Zanu - PF party and poured scorn on the " Mickey Mouse " opposition .
He mocked exiles linked to the Movement for Democratic Change , led by Zimbabwe 's prime minister , Morgan Tsvangirai , for using offices in Sandton , a wealthy suburb of Johannesburg .
" They can insult us here from air conditioned offices of Sandton , " Malema told journalists at Luthuli House .
" We are unshaken .
They must stop shouting at us .
They must go and fight for their battle in Zimbabwe and win … why are they speaking in Sandton and not Mashonaland or Matabeleland ? "
As Malema went on , Fisher interjected : " You live in Sandton . "
Evidently stung , Malema replied : " Let me tell you , this is a building of a revolutionary party and you know nothing about the revolution . "
Fisher pressed : " So they 're not welcome in Sandton but you are ? "
Malema snapped : " Here you behave or else you jump . "
This prompted laughter from Fisher and others .
" Do n't laugh , " Malema growled .
Fisher commented that the situation had become a " joke " .
Malema then erupted , asking for a security guard to eject Fisher and telling him : " If you 're not going to behave , you 're [ sic ] going to call security to take you out .
This is not a newsroom , this is a revolutionary house and you do n't come here with that tendency .
" Do n't come here with that white tendency .
Not here .
You can do it somewhere else .
Not here .
If you 've got a tendency of undermining blacks , even where you work , you are in the wrong place .
Here you are in the wrong place . "
Fisher responded : " That 's rubbish .
That 's absolute rubbish . "
Malema continued : " You can go out .
Rubbish is what you have covered in that trouser .
That is rubbish .
You are a small boy , you can't do anything . "
Collecting his dictaphone and walking out , Fisher said : " I did n't come here to be insulted . "
Malema bellowed after him : " Go out .
Go out .
Bastard !
Go out .
You bloody agent ! "
Later , asked to explain why he had ejected the BBC journalist , Malema said : " This is Luthuli House .
This is the headquarters of a revolutionary party which has liberated the people of South Africa .
It 's not a playground .
Here you come , you restrain yourself , you behave in a manner that is befitting of being the headquarters of the African National Congress .
It 's not a beer hall here .
" You do n't howl here .
Especially when we speak , you behave like you are in an American press conference ?
It 's not America .
It 's Africa .
You must behave in an African way .
You are in Rome , you do what the Romans do … if you feel offended by the removal of this gentleman , you are most welcome to walk . "
The opposition Democratic Alliance said the incident proved that Malema was " South Africa 's Mugabe " .
Mpowele Swathe , shadow minister of rural development , said : " Malema 's hysterical , conspiracy theory - laden attack on the BBC is painfully reminiscent of the frequent claims by Mugabe that he is the victim of ' malicious propaganda by external forces ' .
" His actions , in throwing the journalist out of the press conference , are no different to Mugabe 's censorship of the press in Zimbabwe , and his banning of outlets like the BBC from reporting there . "
Malema announced that he would heed the ANC 's call for restraint and stop singing the apartheid era song that has the words " Shoot the Boer " , an incitement seen by some people as causing the recent murder of the white supremacist Eugene Terre ' Blanche .
The coal mine rocked by an explosion that killed at least 25 workers in the nation ’s deadliest mining disaster since 1984 had been cited for 600 violations in less than a year and a half , some of them for not properly ventilating methane Ã¢â‚¬â€ the highly combustible gas suspected in the blast .
The disaster at the Upper Big Branch mine has focused attention on the business and safety practices of the owner , Massey Energy , a powerful and politically connected company in Appalachia known for producing big profits , as well as big piles of safety and environmental violations and big damage awards for grieving widows .

“ There are mines in this country who have operated safely for 20 years , ” said J. Davitt McAteer , head of the federal Mine Safety and Health Administration in the Clinton administration .
“ There are mines who take precautions ahead of time .
There are mines who spend the money and manpower to do it . ”
He added : “ Those mines have n’t been blown up . ”
Four other miners were missing and feared dead underground in Monday ’s blast , believed to have been caused by a buildup of methane , a naturally occurring gas that is odorless and colorless .
Last year alone , MSHA cited Upper Big Branch for 495 violations and proposed $ 911,802 in fines .
Production more than tripled during that period , according to federal records .
So far this year , the agency has found 105 violations at the mine .
Upper Big Branch is one of Massey ’s biggest underground mines , with more than 200 employees , and it is not uncommon for big coal mines to amass hundreds of violations a year Ã¢â‚¬â€  and to contest many of them , as Massey does .
But most big mines do n’t have as many serious infractions as Upper Big Branch , industry experts said .

At least 50 citations charge the company with “ unwarrantable failure ” to comply with safety standards such as following an approved ventilation plan , controlling combustible materials or designating escape routes .
“ I ’ve never seen that many for one mine in a year , ” said Ellen Smith , editor of Mine Safety & Health News .
“ If you look at other mines that are the same size or bigger , they do not have the sheer number of `unwarrantable ’ citations that this mine has . ”
Massey has had problems elsewhere , too .
In 2006 , two miners were killed in a fire at Massey ’s Aracoma Alma No. 1 mine .
Massey settled a wrongful death lawsuit for an undisclosed sum , and its subsidiary Aracoma Coal Co. paid $ 4.2 million in civil and criminal penalties .

Testimony showed Massey CEO Don Blankenship suggested firing two supervisors for raising concerns about conveyer belt problems just before the belt caught fire .
“ Massey has a history of emphasizing production , ” said Pittsburgh lawyer Bruce Stanley , who represented the miners ’ widows .
“ I ’m concerned that they may not have learned the lessons of Aracoma . ”

In an interview less than 24 hours after the disaster at Upper Big Branch , Blankenship insisted the mine is no more dangerous than others of comparable size , and he defended the company ’s track record in a perilous business .
“ It ’s natural that the enemies of coal would view Massey as the primary enemy , ” he said .
He pointed out Massey ’s many innovations , such as installing steps in place of ladders and putting protective cages on underground vehicles even though the government does n’t require them .

“ I think that I ’ve proven that we run safer coal mines Ã¢â‚¬â€  you know , most of the time Ã¢â‚¬â€ and accidents sometimes happen .

Kevin Stricklin , an MSHA administrator , said that the number of citations at the mine appeared high , and that he was concerned about the more serious violations .
“ It means the operator was aware of some of these conditions , ” he said .
Massey is contesting 36 percent of all violations at Upper Big Branch since 2007 , The Associated Press found .
Overall , U.S. mine operators contest 27 percent .
Challenging violations can enable a mine owner to stave off the heavier punishment that the government can impose on companies that have been deemed repeat offenders .
Massey became a political and industrial powerhouse under the guidance of Blankenship , who rose from poverty to become one of corporate America ’s highest - paid and least apologetic executives , a guy who proudly displays in his office a TV set with a bullet hole from a striking union miner ’s rifle .

He freely spent millions of dollars from his personal fortune to help install a West Virginia Supreme Court justice , a maneuver that led to an important conflict - of - interest ruling from the U.S. Supreme Court , and on a failed bid to elect a Republican majority in the state Legislature .
Under Blankenship , Massey clawed to the top of the Appalachian coal industry , shrewdly buying up coal deposits to amass more than 2 billion tons of reserves .
It is a major economic force regionally , with more than 6,000 high - paid miners in some of the poorest counties in America .
Operating nonunion mines across southern West Virginia , eastern Kentucky and southwestern Virginia , Massey more than doubled its profit to $ 104.4 million in 2009 from the year before , despite slumping demand for coal amid the recession .
The company expects to be shipping 2 million tons of coal a year to India by next year .
Massey has managed to push the United Mine Workers union out of all of its operations except for a single processing plant .

Blankenship ’s hard - driving approach was illustrated in a 2005 memo in which he told mine workers that if their bosses ask them to build roof supports or perform similar tasks , “ ignore them and run coal . ”
“ This memo is necessary only because we seem not to understand that the coal pays the bills , ” he wrote .
Few workers are willing to openly criticize Massey because of its powerful hold on people ’s livelihoods in Appalachia .
But Terry Holstein , who worked at Upper Big Branch , said it took him 10 years to decide he did n’t like the way Massey ran the mine .
He left in 2006 .

Advertisement South Korea has raised the front half of a warship which sank last month near the disputed sea border with the North .
An unexplained explosion split the ship in half and it sank with the loss of 46 sailors .
Investigators have already said the damage appeared to have been caused by an external blast , feeding suspicions North Korea may have been involved .
South Korea has avoided blaming the North outright and Pyongyang has denied any role in the sinking of the vessel .
The front half of the Cheonan , a 1,200 - tonne corvette , was raised by a giant crane and placed on a barge to be towed to a naval port for inspection .
The stern was lifted out of the sea last week .
The body of one missing sailor was found in the bow wreckage and it will be searched for the bodies of six of its crew who are still missing .
Fifty - eight sailors were rescued after the explosion on 26 March .
' Resolute ' response Military sources cited by South Korea 's Yonhap news agency said there was more evidence from the bow section that the explosion that sank the ship was external .
Part of the bottom of the front half appeared to have been blown off diagonally , the unnamed sources said .
If the two halves of the ship were fitted together , the centre of the bottom of the ship would be shaped like an inverted V , they said .
The ship 's smoke stack and its radar mast , both located at the centre of the ship , were also reported to be missing .
Australian , US and Swedish investigators are helping the South Koreans with their investigation into the cause of the sinking .
Tensions have mounted over the incident , with Pyongyang accusing Seoul of " deliberately linking " it to the sinking .
South Korean President Lee Myung - bak has vowed to respond " resolutely " to the sinking and bolster the military , though he has not accused North Korea .
The two countries are still technically at war since the 1950 - 53 war ended without a peace treaty .
There have been three previous naval clashes in the same area as the Cheonan went down , off the west coast of the peninsula .

Tomato season is usually still the heat of summer .
It certainly was the Thursday I got my tomatoes .
I hefted the bushel box from my car trunk to a stool on my kitchen deck -- thankfully only a few steps .
I had a tarp roof on the deck and an umbrella over the deck table , so there was some shade .
Then I set up everything to do as much as possible outside .
I really hate scalding and skinning tomatoes .
I like opening a jar of sauce and just using it in the winter , so I make sauce .
I really like the taste of fire - roasted tomatoes .
I 've also found that if you let them sit , a wonderful tomato stock drains from them -- and there is that much less liquid to boil off your sauce !
This year I set up an assembly line : roast , extract stock , extract pulp , dump debris .
Through the door to the right of the grill is the kitchen stove and I have a movable island that I use for my jar - filling station .
The deck table held the pots for pulp and stock .
We have an Australian barbeque that has a grill on one side and a griddle on the other .
I put a marble tile on the griddle to hold the bowl and colander for the stock extraction station .
Another marble tile went on the wooden side rack to hold the tomato mill , which has a suction grip that worked fine on the glossy tile surface .
The domed cover for our grill is a repurposed large stainless steel bowl with an attached knob .
With a conventional grill , you 'll need another small table to hold your extraction stations .
You will probably , however , be able to roast twice as many tomatoes at a time as I could .
The Romas I got were about the size of tennis balls .
These take longer to roast than paste tomatoes the size of plums , which is what I usually get from my garden .
Once I got going , I used the roasting time to extract the stock , mill the pulp , gather the other sauce ingredients and prepare them .
Use a high setting on your grill .
You want the skins slightly blackened and the insides soft .
The first side takes longer .
Once you turn your tomatoes , the second side browns quickly and splits .
If you have mixed sizes , try to sort by size when loading the grill .
Then you can toss them all into the colander at the same time .
I ’ve recently been fascinated by the idea of sous vide cooking – a method of slowly cooking vacu - sealed foods in a precisely controlled water bath to achieve the optimal doneness .
Last year , Sur La Table started carrying the world ’s first “ home ” sous vide cooker , the SousVide Supreme .
This was fantastic , since commercial sous vide cooking machines cost north of $ 2000 .
However , the home model ( priced at $ 450 ) is still a steep investment for something that essentially just keeps water warm .
I was determined that I could build a better device on - the - cheap .
Behold , the $ 75 DIY sous vide heating immersion circulator !
By scrapping together parts that are readily available on eBay and Amazon , I was able to build a self - contained device that heats and circulates water while maintaining a temperature accurate to .1 degree Celsius ( yes , point one degrees ! ) .
And unlike the SousVide Supreme , my device can be mounted onto any container ( up to a reasonable size , perhaps 15 gallons ) allowing you more room to cook , if needed .
To build your own device , you ’ll need some basic soldering skills , the list of stuff below , about 6 hours of free time ( plus time for glue to dry ) and the can - do attitude of a geek who does n’t want to pay $ 450 for a water heater .
Click the “ more ” link for complete step - by - step instructions .
If these instructions have helped you build you own machine , I hope you ’ll consider donating .
My goal is to mass - produce the world ’s first sous vide heating immersion circulator for under $ 100 , and every donation helps !
Update : Along with my business partners , I ’ve finally commercialized a home sous vide machine !
It ’s called the Sansaire , and it ’s available for pre-order now !
Makes : 1 sous vide immersion heater
Total tinker time : about 6 hours
Shopping list :
Note :
Make sure the controller you purchase has an SSR or Voltage output .
Controllers with a relay - only output will require an external relay and different wiring than what is listed in this project .
I ’ve updated the parts list to specify an SSR – it adds a little to the cost of the project , but it is far more reliable , easier to connect , and works with any SSR / Voltage - output PID controller .
1 piece of 1/4 ” acrylic , about 5 cm x 20cm
1/4 ” x 2 ” eye bolt and nut
About 2 ’ of 16 - 18 gauge wire
3 wire nuts
Electrical tape
A means of cutting acrylic ( see article )
Soldering iron and solder
Multimeter ( tool that measures voltage , current , resistance )
Hobby knife ( X - Acto or similar )
Tub and Tile Silicone Caulk
Hot glue gun
Krazy Glue
Step 1 – Making cutouts in your enclosure
This is the most difficult part of the whole project .
In order for the final assembly to be sturdy , water - resistant and decent looking , you ’ll need to cut your mounting holes as precisely as possible .
I am very lucky to have access to a laser cutter at a lab at work , which makes this kind of precision cutting very easy and accurate .
However , in the absence of a $ 30 K computerized laser cutting machine , with a steady hand , you can achieve the same results using a high - speed rotary tool like a Dremel .
I ’ve included a cutting template that is matched to the heaters , PID controller and switch in the shopping list .
However , if you use different parts ( different models , different manufacturers ) you ’ll need to adjust the template to ensure a tight fit of all parts .
Click here for the 1:1 scale diagram ( PDF )
Pick a side of the storage container that you want to be the bottom .
Using the template as a guide , cut out the three holes for the immersion heaters .
Make sure that these holes are closest to the open end of the container ( the end that has the lid ) to ensure you ’ll be able to reach inside later for wiring , etc .
Next , cut the small oval - shaped hole for the water pump power cord .
Turn the container over so the side with the holes is facing down .
Now , cut out the openings for the PID controller , the on - off switch , and the power cord .
Be sure that the hole for the PID controller is towards the top .
Otherwise , you ’ll be cramped for space when trying to reach the back of the controller .
Next , dry - fit all of the parts to ensure a good , snug fit .
The tighter the fit , the more sturdy the finished product will be .
Step 2 – Making the mounting bracket and pump holder
The mounting bracket is a J - shaped piece of acrylic that will let you attach the finished sous vide cooker to the side of a pot or basin .
Cut out the rectangle on the 2nd page of the parts diagram and drill the hole as indicated .
Find a rectangular surface that will allow you to make the 2 90 - degree bends necessary to shape the acrylic into a “ J ” .
I used a small , glass olive oil bottle with flat sides and rounded corners .
Turn on your stove .
Holding the long end of the acrylic with an oven mitt , warm it a few inches above your stovetop , turning to heat both sides .
It may take a few minutes for the acrylic to be warm enough to bend - you ’ll know you ’re getting close when the acrylic starts to curl away from the heat .
Bend the acrylic along ( approximately ) the lines indicated in the diagram to form a “ J ” .
Press the bottom part of the J ( not the side with the hole , and not the long side ) against a flat surface such as your counter top .
Immediately cool the acrylic with cool water to hold its form .
Step 3 – Mounting the immersion heaters
The immersion heaters are the primary working element of the sous vide machine .
We ’ll mount them hanging down from the bottom of the enclosure , and arranged so that the opening in the middle of the coil is lined up between all three heaters .
Cut the power cord off of each heater , leaving about a 4 ” tail of wires from the heating end .
Keep one of the long lengths of power cord ( including the plug ) to use later as the main power cord .
Using your hobby knife , scrape down the flat sides of the heater handles to remove lettering and to flatten out the circular rim at the top of the handle .
This will allow for a deeper and tighter fit in the heater openings .
Arrange all three heaters in their respective openings .
Note that the heaters should be oriented such that the coils are facing towards the center - line of the enclosure .
You should be able to fit your finger down the middle of all three coils .
Make sure the heaters are snug in their openings .
Apply a small bead of tub and tile caulk around the heaters on the outside of the enclosure .
Allow to dry overnight before proceeding .
Step 4 – Wiring
CAUTION : Do n’t ever power on the heater coils unless they are submerged in water !
Also , do n’t electrocute yourself .
If you have experience with basic circuitry and wiring , this will be pretty easy .
However , if you ’ve never worked with a soldering iron or circuit diagrams , these steps will take you a while .
Refer to the wiring diagram below for the “ big picture . ”
Wiring diagram for JLD612 PID Controller with SSR
Wiring Diagram for CD101 PID Controller with physical relay
Update : I ’ve updated the wiring diagram to make it clear that the view of the relay posts is from below .
In other words , if you set the relay down on your table with the pins facing up , that will match the alignment in the wiring diagram .
Strip off about 1/4 ” of shielding from your power cord ( remember , the cord that you saved from one of the immersion heaters ? ) .
Run the power cord in through the power cord opening on the front of the enclosure .
Separate the 2 wires about 6 ” .
One of these wires will go through the power switch , and the other will go directly to the PID controller , heaters and pump .
Use your multimeter to find the two posts on the back of the power switch that are normally open , but closed when the switch is on .
On my power switch , these were the far and middle posts ( not the two posts closest to the “ ON ” side of the switch , you know , with the dot ) .
Pass the switch mounting nut ( the thing that screws on the back ) over one lead from the power cable , inside the enclosure .
Run the lead out through the power switch hole .
Solder that lead to one of the posts you identified in step 2 . Cut an 8 ” length of wire and solder one end to the 2nd lead on the switch .
Tuck the wires inside the enclosure , place the switch in its hole , and tighten the mounding nut to secure it in place .
You ’re now done with the power switch .
Next , wire together the heater leads .
Separate the leads from the heating coils .
Gather together one lead from each coil to make two bundles of three .
Cut two 6 ” lengths of wire and add one to each bundle .
You should now have two bundles , each with four wires – 3 of which go to the heaters , and one left dangling .
Solder the wires in each bundle together , then cap with a wire nut and some electrical tape .
Of the leads you have coming out of the heater bundles , one will go straight to the incoming power , and the other will go to the relay that turns on and off the heaters .
At this point , it gets too difficult to describe the rest of the wiring in words , so refer to the wiring diagram .
Just make sure to be aware of how everything will mount in the enclosure when you ’re all done .
Pass the wires through the mounting ring on of the PID controller before attaching them to the terminals , etc .
After wiring the connections to the relay ( or SSR ) , coat the bottom with hot glue to surround the connection points .
This will act as an insulator and prevent the relay from shorting out against any metal inside the case .
Or , if your SSR came with a plastic cover , secure it in place to prevent the connections from shorting .
If you are using the PT100 thermocouple ( which I recommend ) , make sure you connect the leads exactly as shown in the wiring diagram or you will have an inaccurate temperature reading .
( There ’s no instruction manual with these probes , so it took 30 minutes of trying different combinations before I found the right one ) .
Step 5 – Final Assembly
Using Krazy Glue , glue the J clamp to the bottom - front of the enclosure .
Wait until dry before proceeding .
Note :
This glue joint is a popular point of failure .
If you ’d like , strengthen the connection between the J clamp and the body by using two screws and nuts .
Glue the nut for the eye bolt to the inside of the hole in the J clamp .
Ensure that the nut lines up with the hole so the eye bolt can pass through .
Seal the openings for the power cord and pump cord using tub and tile caulk .
Put the back cover on the enclosure and wrap the seam with electrical tape .
Stick the suction cup feet of the immersion pump to the flat end of the J clamp and position the water outlet to pump through the middle of the heating coils .
Step 6 – Testing
Now that everything is wired up and assembled , you probably want to see if it works .
WAIT !
Do n’t turn the machine on ( ever ! ) unless the coils are submerged in water or , they will burn out in about 5 seconds ( I learned this the hard way ) .
To test the machine out , fill a basin with water so that it covers at least the coil part of the heaters .
Mount the machine on the edge , so that the J clamp hangs over the lip .
Tighten the eye bolt to secure the machine .
Plug in the cord and flip the power switch !
If the PID controller turns on and the pump starts pumping , that ’s a good sign !
Note that the heaters may not warm up just yet , depending on what the target temperature is by default .
Step 7 – Programming the PID Controller
For users of the JLD612 PID Controller
For programming instructions such as running Auto - tune and changing alarm values , refer to the JLD612 manual .
Here are the steps you should take when programming your controller for the first time .
Press SET and enter code 0089 , then press SET .
Set the value of Inty to Pt10.0 to get the temperature to display with one decimal place .
( I had to set it to Pt100 , then back to Pt10.0 to get this to work the first time .
Select End to exit the programming menu .
For users of the CD101 PID Controller
Out - of - the - box , the PID controller is designed to work with a different type of thermocouple , so the readings that you get using a PT100 will be strange .
Follow the instructions in this manual ( that does n’t ship with the PID controller ) to set it for the PT100 probe .
You can also follow the instructions there to set the number of decimal points of precision .
Next , set a target temperature by tapping the SET button , then using the up and down arrows to pick a number and pressing SET again to confirm .
50 C is a good target temp .
The OUT1 light will light up , indicating that the PID controller is turning on the heater .
You should hear a soft clicking noise – this is the relay kicking in .
At this point , the heating coils are on and warming up .
As the temperature measured by the probe ( green , top line ) approaches the target value ( orange , 2nd line ) , the relay will click on and off more frequently to sustain the temperature ..
Ideas , Improvements , Thoughts
After burning out my first set of heating coils , I realized that there must be a better method of heating the water .
The coils are very effective and heat the water very quickly .
However , I ’m pretty paranoid about burning them out again , and they ’re a pain to replace .
I ’ve found some commercial immersion heating elements , but they ’re about $ 100 , which inflates the budget for this project by quite a bit .
I may try using the heating element and pump system from an old espresso machine , the kind that makes steam .
Since it already has a self - contained heater and an pump , it might even be cheaper than the heating coils and aquarium pump .
I ’ve also thought about turning this machine into a general - purpose temperature control unit .
Instead of wiring the heaters directly to the relay , I would install a power outlet on the back of the enclosure and add a jack to plug in an external temperature probe .
If I wanted to use the immersion heaters , I ’d just plug them in to the power outlet .
If one got fried , I ’m only out $ 6 instead of an hour of removing glue and solder .
Also , a general - purpose temperature controller is great for making your own smoker box .
A - la Alton Brown , you can plug in a hotplate filled with wood chips and have a precisely temperature - controlled smoker for just a few bucks .
I ’m thrilled to start playing with sous vide cooking , and I ’m happy that I was able to build an accurate , reliable machine for $ 75 .
Even the PID Controller +
Crockpot method costs $ 185 ( not including the Crockpot ! ) .
Troubleshooting
I gotten a lot of emails and comments asking for troubleshooting help , and rightfully so – there ’s a lot going on in this project , especially if you ’re pretty new to DIY electronics .
I ’ve decided to add my basic troubleshooting routine , which should hopefully get you sorted out .
If you still have problems , please post a comment below , or send me an email at scott@seattlefoodgeek.com .
If your heaters do n’t get hot when they should ( i.e. , your machine is n’t working ) , do the following :
Ensure that your OUT1 light goes on and off when it should .
It should be on when the unit is heating , and off when you ’re at or above the set value .
If not , double check that you ’ve set your temperature probe type correctly , and that OUT1 is set to heating mode in the PID settings menu .
If this looks correct , proceed to step 2 .
Verify that your PID controller has an SSR / Voltage output .
This should be specified on the sticker on the side of your PID controller .
The controller in the photo below only has a relay output ( this is not what you want ) .
PID controllers generally have two types of outputs : relay and voltage .
Contrary to how it sounds , a relay output is not used for controlling a relay .
Rather , a PID controller with a relay output actually has an internal relay .
Unfortunately , the internal relay is typically not rated for the kind of load that the heating coils pull , so you cannot connect them directly to the internal relay .
A PID controller with an SSR / voltage output produces a DC voltage ( 8 - 12V DC ) that we can use to control an external mechanical relay or a solid state relay ( SSR ) .
That ’s what we want .
Telltale signs that your PID controller has a relay - only output : a ) there ’s no voltage across pins 5&6 ( or the corresponding pins on your controller ) when the OUT1 light is on , b ) you hear a clicking sound when OUT1 turns on and off , even when your external ( blue ) relay is disconnected , and c ) you measure continuity across the pins that correspond to OUT1 when OUT1 is on .
If you have a PID controller with a relay output , not all is lost .
You ’ve got two options :
1 ) Return it for a PID controller with an SSR / voltage output , or
2 ) Use the internal relay to control an external 120VAC relay that is rated for 8 + Amps @ 120VAC .
The wiring for this configuration is a little messier , and you ’ll need to buy a different relay than the one specified in the parts list .
The wiring diagram for this configuration is below .
Note that I have n’t attempted to show the actual pin configuration of the external relay – rather this is the logical way you ’ll need to wire it in .
If you ’re sure that your PID controller has an SSR / voltage output , proceed to step 3 .
Verify that you are using the right kind of relay for your PID controller .
The CD101 will work with either an SSR ( solid state relay ) or a physical relay .
However , the JLD612 and many other PID controllers will only work with an SSR .
If you ’re using a CD101 and a physical relay , ensure that your external ( blue ) relay is wired correctly .
You should hear a clicking noise coming from that relay when OUT1 lights up or turns off .
If not , you may have connected the leads from pins 5 & 6 backwards , or your external relay may require a higher activation voltage than what your PID controller outputs .
Measure the voltage from pins 5 & 6 and compare to the coil voltage specified by your relay .
In practice , there is some wiggle room ( ex. , a relay with a 9V coil will often be activated by less than 9V ) .
If the PID does n’t produce enough voltage , buy an SSR .
If your relay is clicking , proceed to step 5 .
Check for 120VAC going to the heater leads when OUT1 is on .
If you ’re not seeing a voltage , check the connections across your relay and between pin 1 and your heaters .
If you ’re getting 120VAC to your heater bundles , proceed to step 6 .
Your heaters are likely burnt out .
This can happen in a flash if you accidentally supply power to the heaters when they are out of water .
Double check by submerging your heaters and connecting an 120VAC power source directly to the leads ( exercising great caution not to electrocute yourself ) .
If they heat up , you ’ve got a loose wire somewhere in your connections .
If they do n’t heat up , they ’re burnt out and you ’ll need to replace them .
If these instructions have helped you build you own machine , I hope you ’ll consider donating .
My goal is to mass - produce the world ’s first sous vide heating immersion circulator for under $ 100 , and every donation helps !

How much longer is the myth that Sarah Palin is the GOP ’s messiah going to persist ?
More evidence was delivered against her when then Southern Republican Leadership Conference chose to support both Mitt Romney and Ron Paul over Sarah the Savior .
Palin even showed up for this gathering and spoke to the crowd , but still failed to look like anything more than the reality TV train wreck that she is .
The surprise coming out of the Southern Republican Leadership Conference straw poll was that Sarah Palin actually showed up , quite possibly even unpaid , and it did not make a bit difference in her results with the attendees who were polled .
Mitt Romney and Ron Paul tied for first in the straw poll at 24 % , but Romney got the win because he gained one more vote than Paul , 439-438 .
Sarah Palin finished third at 18 % .
Oh , but Palin was not alone because tied with her in third was Newt Gingrich .
Now does anyone in their right mind believe that 1990s Republican relic Newt Gingrich has any shot at the Republican nomination ?
Yet , Sarah Palin keeps being treated by many in the media and all of her Jonestown of the North followers as if she is the great white hope for the GOP in 2012 .

Romney did n’t even speak to the audience at the SRLC and he won their support .
Rep. Ron Paul ( R - TX ) has more true grassroots activist support than Sarah Palin could ever dream of , but he is labeled a fringe loony red headed step child by the Republican establishment , while Sarah Palin gets a high profile job at Fox News , and anointed a serious contender for the 2012 GOP nomination .
The problem is that Palin appears to lack the popularity to justify the hype .
Sarah Palin and the intellectual zombies of death that support her are trying to put a big con over , not only on the Republican Party , but also the American people .
The numbers do n’t back up their claims of Sarah Palin ’s national popularity .
Since she ran on the GOP ticket with John McCain , Palin has seen her favorability ratings drop from 52 % when she was the fresh face on the ticket in September 2008 to 24 % today .
To put this into context , she “ wrote ” a book , landed a few national TV gigs , and she lost over half of her support .
Palin ’s zealots counter any negative utterance that tries to explain that she is more Alaskan Kardashian than political Moses by claiming that Democrats are afraid of Sarah Palin .
What should Democrats be afraid of ?
At her current pace , by 2012 Palin will have a favorability rating of roughly 12 % .
Assuming that the Democrats actually want to win the next election , could the GOP give them a greater gift than nominating one of the most unpopular politicians in America to represent their party ?
Sarah has done a masterful job at promoting herself as someone with a following , but she has burned everyone from magazines to Fox News with her inability to draw a crowd beyond those who already love her .
What about Palin ’s book Going Rogue ?
Well it turns out those sales numbers were extremely inflated .
Most retailers quickly discovered that after Palin ’s fans bought theirs , they could n’t give the damn things away , although many of them stopped just short of doing exactly that .
Sarah Palin is the Enron of Republican presidential candidates .
She is a myth built on tricky accounting and smoke and mirrors .
Like any good snake oil salesman / woman / person , she has now been trying to sell herself as the right wing messiah who can bring both the Tea Party and the Republican Party together .
In reality , Palin is a false prophet .
She is exploiting the right and selling them a phony dream , while lining her own pockets with their cash .
Even if she would unite the right , that 24 % favorable rating of hers ensures a landslide reelection victory for Obama , so sorry Palin fans , we do n’t fear Sarah , we ’re rooting for her .

When my son Ben was in kindergarten , he was thrilled to receive his first birthday invitation of the year , from his friend Zachary .
' We 're going to Pump - It - Up ! " he cried , naming the local jumpy - house - hot - spot for the under - 10 set .
I was thrilled , too .
And then I read the fine print .
" Zachary is registered at Toys ' R ' Us , where a kid can be a kid ! "
And , apparently , where a kid can force his classmates to shop from a pre-approved list of goods , most of which were outside my price comfort zone .
Not wanting to break parenting protocol , I grudgingly purchased an item off the registry and smiled tightly when Zachary told Ben it was " just what he wanted . "
( Quelle surprise . )
While I 'd never before heard of registering for your child 's birthday , I was behind the parenting curve .
Within a matter of months , I saw registries for kids everywhere : at the toy store , at the book store , online … suddenly , it was de rigueur not just to invite people to a party , but to give specific suggestions regarding what people -- your guests -- should bring inside those brightly wrapped packages .
Fast forward five years , and my child receives another unusual ( to me at least ) invitation .
In this case , we were asked to donate money to a fund for underprivileged kids , in lieu of presents .
Okay , I 'm listening .
But here 's what got me : 50 percent of the money we donated would go to the charity , with the other half going to the birthday boy .
So I was stuck : I did n't know if I should match the birthday money with an equal donation , thereby doubling my typical gift budget , or cut the typical amount in half .
Now , I 'm not opposed to registries , per se .
I understand the point , particularly for wedding registries .
After all , my husband and I were the recipients of numerous duplicates and " unusual " gifts at our own nuptials ( including three bread makers and a six - pack of barbecue sauce ) .
There were a few guests we wished had adhered a little more closely to the list at Crate & Barrel , but the gifts were all appreciated , and the gift - givers properly thanked .
But something about registering your six - year - old 's preferences for Barbie dolls and Lego sets rubs me the wrong way .
I 've heard the arguments from the proponents :
Gift registries allow kids to get what they really desire , they reduce waste because the presents are actually put to use rather than left fallow at the back of a closet , and they cut down on the hassle ( and potentially environmentally unfriendly practice ) of having to drive to the store and exchange the unwanted Chutes and Ladders game for something more alluring .
But here 's what I do n't like .
Allowing your kids to dictate what gifts they receive for a birthday , Christmas , or other landmark event smacks me as a tad mercenary , even if ( or maybe especially if ! ) half that money is being donated to a charity not of the gift - giver 's selection .
Gifts should be given without strings attached on either side , otherwise they 're not a gift at all .
And by asking flat - out for money , you 're basically charging admission to your child 's event and asking people to put a dollar value on attending .
( We gave Steven $ 20 for his party , but that was at home .
Paul 's is at the movies , so maybe we should give him $ 25 ? )
Giving your guests a list of approved stores or items also leaves no room for the giver 's own creativity or preferences .
For instance , I made it a point years ago to give books as gifts whenever possible , and avoid electronic / video games and anything it the word " Bratz " in the title .
So I 'm left with a dilemma if little Clara 's list is full of items that do n't make my own personal " To Buy " list .
Do I compromise my personal values or disappoint the birthday child ?
And that 's what it really comes down to .
Registries teach children that they deserve to get what they want , all the time .
To me , registries seem to be just another way to protect our kids from pain or disappointment of any kind , including the traumatic experience of receiving an unwanted copy of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer 's Stone .
In my ideal world , kids need to learn to be grateful and show appreciation for what they receive , whether it's yet another set of Tinker Toys , an itchy pair of pajamas , or a donation to the National Association for Aquatic Snail Salvation ( I made that last one up ) .
Sure , some presents may be less than thrilling to your child , and that 's a good thing .
It 's an opportunity to show him that the focus of the celebration should be on sharing a fun event with your friends , not on the loot that you rake in .
It also gives him a chance to be introduced to new interests and adventures he might not have discovered on his own ( the unrequested geode kit from Aunt Sally might spark a new love for geology and rock collecting ) .
So here 's my bottom line :
If I 'm asked what my birthday child might like for a gift , I 'll readily present a few broad categories ( books , board games , anything with glitter for my daughter ) .
But I 'll also teach my child to say " Thanks " graciously and sincerely , no matter what that beribboned box might hold -- even a six - pack of barbecue sauce .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Goldman Sachs Group
Inc may enter talks to settle U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission fraud charges as soon as today , Fox Business Network ’s Charlie Gasparino reported .
Goldman officials believe the SEC ’s case is without merit , but the firm does not want to battle with regulators , the report said , citing sources including an unidentified senior executive at the firm .
Goldman would likely focus on getting regulators to back off civil fraud charges , and agree to lesser charges and a fine , the report said .
But people close to the SEC said the commission may be reluctant to agree to a lenient settlement , Gasparino reported .
Goldman Sachs spokesman Samuel Robinson declined to comment .
SEC spokesman John Heine also declined to comment .
The object access benchmarks last weeks was not surprising but a factor 5 between access “ obj. a ” and “ obj.getA ( ) ” is interesting .
In this second part I check the access time for properties on objects , created with ECMAScript 3 getter / setter and with the ECMAScript 5 Object .
defineProperty variant ( works on IE8 + , FF3.7 + , newest Webkit and Chrome 5 ) – see more on ECMAScript 5 compatibility table .
Oliver asked to add getter tests – and the results produce differences with factor 15 - 100 .
1. JavaScript property with get
Since ECMAScript 3 ( works in FF , Safari 3+ , Opera 9.5+ , Chrome and IE8 ) we can define properties with getter and setter instead building manually with functions .
John Resig has explained the getter syntax in 2007 .
var obj = { get a ( ) { return 1 ; } , get b( ) { return 1 ; } , get c ( ) { return 1 ; } , get d( ) { return 1 ; } , get e( ) { return 1 ; } , } ; JSLitmus.test ( " ObjectPropertyConstantGet " , function ( ) { sum = obj. a + obj.b + obj.c + obj.d + obj.e ; } ) ;
The example object is only readable , returns the constant 1 and no setter are defined .
2. JavaScript getter and setter in prototype
Instead of defining it directly in the object the getter and setter can defined in the prototype of the object and the value of a public property will saved in a ( per convention private ) variable with evil underbar .
function Data( ) { this .a=1 , this .b=1 , this .c=1 , this .d=1 , this .e=1 ; } ; Data. prototype = { get a ( ) { return this ._a ; } , get b( ) { return this ._b ; } , get c ( ) { return this ._c ; } , get d( ) { return this ._d ; } , get e( ) { return this ._e ; } , set a ( v ) { this ._a=v ; } , set b( v ) { this ._b=v ; } , set c( v ) { this._c=v ; } , set d( v ) { this ._d=v ; } , set e( v ) { this ._e=v ; } } ; var obj = new Data( ) ; JSLitmus.test ( " ObjectPropertySetGet " , function ( ) { sum = obj. a + obj.b + obj.c + obj.d + obj.e ; } ) ;
This getter and setter constructs work like a normal function so the benchmarks should be the same .
3. JavaScript defineProperty
An upgraded property definition looks in ECMAScript 5 like this .
First I defined only the three attributes to false – if you more interested read the longer article from John Resig .
Writable .
If false , the value of the property can not be changed .
Configurable .
If false , any attempts to delete the property or change its attributes ( Writable , Configurable , or Enumerable ) will fail .
Enumerable .
If true , the property will be iterated over when a user does “ for ( var prop in obj ) {} ” ( or similar ) .
var obj = {} ; Object.defineProperty( obj , " a " , { value : 1 , writeable : false , enumerable : false , configurable : false} ) ; Object.defineProperty( obj , " b " , { value : 1 , writeable : false , enumerable : false , configurable : false} ) ; Object.defineProperty( obj , " c " , { value : 1 , writeable : false , enumerable : false , configurable : false} ) ; Object.defineProperty( obj , " d " , { value : 1 , writeable : false , enumerable : false , configurable : false} ) ; Object.defineProperty( obj , " e " , { value : 1 , writeable : false , enumerable : false , configurable : false} ) ; JSLitmus.test ( " ObjectDescriptor " , function ( ) { sum = obj. a + obj.b + obj.c + obj.d + obj.e ; } ) ;
With all attributes set to false it should be fast than plain objects .
My experiments with try out all the variants of false and true has the same results .
4. JavaScript defineProperty with getter / setter
The last example can expanded with getter .
It works like example 2 .
var obj = {} ; var a=1 , b=1 , c=1 , d=1 , e=1 ; Object.defineProperty( obj , " a " , { get : function ( ) { return a ; } , set : function ( v ) { a=v ; } } ) ; Object.defineProperty( obj , " b " , { get : function ( ) { return b ; } , set : function ( v ) { b=v ; } } ) ; Object.defineProperty( obj , " c " , { get : function ( ) { return c ; } , set : function ( v ) { c=v ; } } ) ; Object.defineProperty( obj , " d " , { get : function ( ) { return d ; } , set : function ( v ) { d=v ; } } ) ; Object.defineProperty( obj , " e " , { get : function ( ) { return e ; } , set : function ( v ) { e=v ; } } ) ; JSLitmus.test ( " ObjectDescriptorGet " , function ( ) { sum = obj. a + obj.b + obj.c + obj.d + obj.e ; } ) ;
Test it in your browser
If you own a compatible browser start your own benchmarks !
The Results
The results for the plain javascript object access started in the first article with the first 8 tests .
All tests with active getter function ( ObjectPropertyConstantGet , ObjectPropertySetGet , ObjectDescriptorGet ) are terrible slow !
The middle graph is the Firefox Developer Preview 3.7a4 , the Opera is version 10.10 .
All benchmarks are stopped on a eeeBox with Intel Atom N270 .
My Story
Ah , the life of a pastor ’s kid !
I grew up in Cambridge , Minnesota – a town of 5,000 people and 22 Christian churches .
My father was ( and still is ) pastor of a small church .
My mother volunteered to support Christian missionaries around the world .
I went to church , Bible study , and other church functions every week .
I prayed often and earnestly .
For 12 years I attended a Christian school that taught Bible classes and creation science .
I played in worship bands .
As a teenager I made trips to China and England to tell the atheists over there about Jesus .
I felt the presence of God. Sometimes I would tingle and sweat with the Holy Spirit .
Other times I felt led by Him to give money to a certain cause , or to pay someone a specific compliment , or to walk to the cross at the front of my church and bow before it during a worship service .
Around age 19 I got depressed , probably because I did nothing but work at Wal - Mart , download music , and watch internet porn .
But one day I saw a leaf twirling in the wind and it was so beautiful – like the twirling plastic bag in the movie American Beauty .
I had an epiphany .
I realized that everything in nature was a gift from God to me .
Grass , lakes , trees , sunsets – all these were gifts of beauty from my Savior to me .
I thought of this every time I saw something beautiful , and God delivered me from my depression ( and my porn addiction ) .
I read Dallas Willard ’s The Divine Conspiracy , a manual for how to fall in love with God so that following his ways is not a burden , but a natural and painless product of loving God .
My dad and I read lots of this Christian self - help stuff .
We shared our latest discoveries with each other and debated theology .
I moved to Minneapolis for college and was attracted to a Christian group led by Mark van Steenwyk .
Mark ’s small group of well - educated Jesus - followers were postmodern , “ missional ” Christians : they thought loving and serving others in the way of Jesus was more important than doctrinal truth .
That resonated with me , and we lived it out with the poor immigrants of Minneapolis .
The seeds of doubt
By this time I had little interest in church structure or petty doctrinal disputes .
I just wanted to be like Jesus .
So I decided I should try to find out who Jesus actually was .
I began to study the Historical Jesus .
What I learned , even when reading Christian scholars , shocked me .
The gospels were written decades after Jesus ’ death , by non-eyewitnesses .
They are riddled with contradictions , legends , and known lies .
Jesus and Paul disagreed on many core issues .
And how could I accept the miracle claims about Jesus when I outright rejected other ancient miracle claims as superstitious nonsense ?
These discoveries scared me .
It was not what I had wanted to learn .
But now I had to know the truth .
I studied the Historical Jesus , the history of Christianity , the Bible , theology , and the philosophy of religion .
Almost everything I read – even the books written by conservative Christians – gave me more reason to doubt , not less .
I started to panic .
I felt like my best friend – my source of purpose and happiness and comfort – was dying .
And worse , I was killing him .
If only I could have faith !
If only I could unlearn all these things and just believe .
I cried out with the words from Mark 9:24 , “ Lord , help my unbelief ! ”
I tried .
For every atheist book I read , I read five books by the very best Christian philosophers .
The atheists made plain , simple sense , and the Christian philosophers were lost in fog of big words that tried to hide the weakness of their arguments .
I did everything I could to keep my faith .
But I could n’t do it .
I could n’t force myself to believe what I knew was n’t true .
On January 11 , 2007 , I whispered to myself : “ There is no God . ”
The next day I emailed my buddy Mark :
I did n’t want to bother you , but I ’m lost and despairing and I could really use your help , if you can give it .
I made a historical study of Jesus , which led me to a study of the Bible , historical and philosophical arguments for and against God , atheist arguments , etc .
It has destroyed my faith .
I think there is almost certainly not a God … I ’m fucking miserable …
I told my parents and they sobbed for 30 minutes .
Can you help me ?
As always , Mark responded with love and honesty .
But he did n’t give me any reasons to believe .
He said he believed mostly for the “ aesthetics of belief ” and his “ somewhat mystical experiences of Christ . ”
He wrote , “ In a way , I am a Christian because I want to be one , and the logic flows from there . ”
I also wrote a defiant email to an atheist radio show host to whom I ’d been listening , Matt Dillahunty :
I was coming from a lifetime high of surrendering … my life to Jesus , releasing myself from all cares and worries , and filling myself and others with love .
Then I began an investigation of the historical Jesus … and since then I ’ve been absolutely miserable .
I do not think I am strong enough to be an atheist .
Or brave enough .
I have a broken leg , and my life is much better with a crutch …
I ’m going to seek genuine experience with God , to commune with God , and to reinforce my faith .
I am going to avoid solid atheist arguments , because they are too compelling and cause for despair .
I do not WANT to live in an empty , cold , ultimately purposeless universe in which I am worthless and inherently alone .
I hope that I find a real , true God in my journey of blind faith .
I do not need to convince you of that God , since you seem satisfied as an atheist .
But I need to convince myself of that God .
Matt responded to my every sentence with care , understanding , and reason .
But I still tried to hang onto my faith .
For a while I read nothing but Christian authors .
Even the smartest ones just made lots of noise about “ the mystery of God . ”
They used big words so that it sounded like they were saying something precise and convincing .
My dad told me I had been led astray because I was arrogant to think I could get to truth by studying .
Humbled and encouraged , I started a new quest to find God .
I wrote on my blog :
I ’ve been humbled .
I was “ doing discipleship ” in my own strength , because I thought I was smart enough and disciplined enough .
[ Now ] having surrendered my prideful and independent ways to him , I can see how my weakness is God ’s strength .
I ’ve repented .
I was deceived because I did not let the Spirit lead me into truth .
Now I ask for God ’s guidance in all quests for knowledge and wisdom .
I feel like I ’ve been born again , again .
It did n’t last .
Every time I reached out for some reason – any reason – to believe , God simply was n’t there .
I tried to believe despite the evidence , but I could n’t believe a lie .
Not anymore .
No matter how much I missed him , I could n’t bring Jesus back to life .
Later …
I do n’t recall how it happened , but eventually I found out that I could be more happy and moral without God than I ever was with him .
I “ came out ” as an atheist to my family , friends , and church .
They were surprised , but they still loved me .
They were much more concerned when two elders of my church decided they were Catholic .
I bonded with them briefly because the three of us were suddenly outcasts .
I had stubbornly resisted my deconversion , but these days I am excited to accept reality , no matter what it is .
I remember when I finally realized the problems inherent to my precious Libertarianism .
I was not dismayed or resistant ; I was thrilled .
This comfort with truth unleashed my curiosity about Christianity and religion in full force .
In my studies I uncovered lots of false facts and dishonest arguments from Christians and atheists .
Each discovery only deepened my hunger for knowledge , but also my realization that humans know very little , and with little certainty .
Looking back
In many ways I regret my Christian upbringing .
So much time and energy wasted on an invisible friend .
So many bad lessons about morality , thinking , and sex .
So much needless guilt .
But mostly I ’m glad this is my story .
Now I know what it ’s like to be a true believer .
I know what it ’s like to fall in love with God and serve him with all my heart .
I know what ’s it like to experience his presence .
I know what it ’s like to isolate one part of my life from reason or evidence , and I know what it ’s like to think that is a virtue .
I know what it ’s like to earnestly seek the truth but still be totally deluded .
I know what it ’s like to think that what I believe , or what my loving pastor says , or what my ancient book says , is more true than what reason and evidence say .
I know what it ’s like to think faith is a strength , not a gullible weakness .
I know what it ’s like to be confused by the Trinity , the failure of prayers , or Biblical contradictions but to genuinely embrace them as the mystery of God .
I know what it ’s like to believe God is so far beyond human reason that we ca n’t understand him , but at the same time to fiercely believe I know the details of how he wants us to behave .
That was my experience for 22 years , and I am grateful for it .
Now I can approach believers with true understanding .

Hi , I have recently given some thought into how we should continue to package haskell libraries , and I have come up with the conclusion that shipping pre-built libraries is a dead end .
I will upload a new version of haskell - devscripts soon which just copies the haskell sources into the - dev package .
- doc and - prof packages are left empty and should be removed with the next upstream version .
The ghc6 - doc trigger will be enhanced to run haddock on the sources upon installation , this way , the users will have documentation for _any_ installed library , not just those with - doc packages installed !
Packages like leksah , who need to do their own indexing , can have similar triggers .
The advantages are obvious : * Arch all packages :
No more buildd troubles .
*
No problems with dependencies .
* Full hugs support for all ( compatible ) libraries for free .
*
Whole program optimization possible , given a sufficiently smart compiler .
* Library code available for reference .
* Less complexity in haskell - devscripts .
* Compilation flags up to the user .
By installing all source files in /usr / share / doc / haskell , users can compile any program easily by passing - i /usr / share / doc / haskell to ghc , and will not have to worry about cabal or ghc packages any more .
I think this will give Debian a great edge over any other Haskell - shipping distribution out there , including Gentoo , Arch and Slackware .

BBC News , Rome
" At this time of penance , we must begin with ourselves "
As the Roman Catholic Church prepares to celebrate the penitential rites of Lent , during which the faithful beg forgiveness for their sins , an unprecedented act of private penance has been held behind closed doors at the Vatican .
Pope Benedict spent two days in one of the Vatican 's sumptuous marble audience halls closeted with 24 Irish bishops who both individually and collectively confessed to him their shortcomings and omissions in the paedophile clergy scandal which has shocked the entire Catholic world .
Cardinal Sean Brady , the Catholic primate of all Ireland , who led the delegation of bishops , said afterwards that " at this time of penance , we must begin with ourselves " .
None of the bishops addressed the substance of the Vatican meeting at a hastily convened news conference at the offices of Vatican Radio .
The proceedings were - like most Vatican business - conducted in total secrecy , but we know from the official Vatican communique issued at the end of this extraordinary crisis meeting that the Pope strongly condemned the child abuse scandal which has been the subject of an official Irish government inquiry , the Murphy report .
' Heinous crime '
The bishops promised the Pope that they were committed to co-operating with the civil authorities over the paedophilia scandal .
Pope Benedict did not spare his words in addressing his Irish bishops .
He said that child abuse was a " heinous crime " as well as a " grave sin " .
He lambasted the bishops for failing to act effectively over cases of sexual abuse of young people .
The crisis within the Irish church goes deeper perhaps than in any other country with a significant Catholic population
Seated at two long tables , the red - clad bishops were invited by the Pope to describe individually - in interventions limited to a maximum of seven minutes each - how they had dealt with cases of priestly paedophilia in their own dioceses , and to explain why so many cases had been systematically covered up during a period of decades .
Although four Irish bishops have tendered their resignations over the scandals , only one of them has had his resignation accepted by the Vatican .
Senior Vatican cardinals responsible for church discipline sat by the Pope 's side to add their opinions on where responsibility lay for one of the worst scandals to have hit the Roman Catholic Church in modern times .
One Irish priest has admitted to abusing more than 100 children , while another confessed that he had abused minors systematically and regularly over a period of 25 years .
At stake is not only the credibility of the Roman Catholic Church in Ireland , but also a lot of Church money .
Compensation to victims of clerical sexual abuse paid out so far has been provided largely by Irish taxpayers .
The Vatican fears that just as in similar scandals of priestly paedophilia in other parts of the world , including the United States , claims by paedophilia victims in Ireland could eventually bankrupt several religious orders as well as individual dioceses .
' Preventive measures planned '
No word has come out of the meeting as to the possibility of a papal visit to Ireland in the near future .
Ireland has an unusually high proportion of bishops Pope Benedict 's travel diary for 2010 - which includes a visit in September to England and Scotland - is already full .
But he will be issuing a pastoral letter to be read out in all Catholic churches in Ireland before Easter , and a draft text of this document was discussed during the closed - door Vatican meetings .
According to Italian press reports this letter will offer " concrete and effective " ways to prevent any recurrence of similar scandals in the future .
The sexual abuse of minors by Catholic clergy has been reported from many countries , and dealing with these scandals has in fact been a worldwide problem for the Pope .
During recent visits to both the United States and Australia , Pope Benedict has specifically apologised to victims of priestly abuse in those countries .
But the crisis within the Irish church goes deeper perhaps than in any other country with a significant Catholic population .
The pope wants " structural change " ' in the organisation of his Church in Ireland , which has an unusually high number of bishops in proportion to its population .
In comparison Germany , with a population about nine times greater , has almost the same number of bishops as Ireland .
But the idea of drastically reducing the number of Irish bishops in a radical administrative reorganisation of a church structure which has not basically changed since the Middle Ages appears to hold little appeal to the current leaders of Ireland 's numerous Catholic dioceses .

“ Doctor , I want my hip bone . ”
Doctor Padgett did a double take .
“ I want my bone , you know , what you ’ll be taking out . ”
“ Well , I do n’t know about that , ” he said , “ you ’ll have to talk to pathology about that . ”
Down the hall , the pathologist said sure .
A couple of weeks after surgery you can have it .
( First they would have to conduct the routine tests on any newly removed body part . )
They both asked me the same question : “ Why ? ” I was n’t sure , I just knew I wanted it .
Perhaps I did n’t want to part with the part of me that had caused me the most pain without having a final word .
So I got the OK .
That and the promise of a small — well , smallish — incision , and I agreed after more than two decades of delay to go under the knife with the hope of trading more pain for less .
Though being a ballet dancer , it really was n’t to lessen the physical pain that I finally decided to have my hip replaced .
It was because of the increasing loss of mobility .
Life was getting smaller , and my hip was starting to rule .
At the age of twenty - three when I was dancing for Balanchine in the New York City Ballet , I was diagnosed with osteoarthritis in my right hip while on tour in Europe .
It all began when I could n’t swoop my right leg up to the side during the opening minutes of Serenade one night at Tivoli .
After many exams and X - rays I got one of those “ Honey , sit down , it ’s all over , your career is finished ” talks from the company orthopedist .
Needless to say I did not obey , though I did have to go to bed for three months to allow the inflammation to subside .
A year later , with the help of Indocin and daily physical therapy , I got back on stage and danced for another eighteen months .
But then other injuries , the body ’s compensation , started adding up and I knew the time had come .
I stopped dancing , but refused to give up my hip .
It was my battle wound , proof of having attained victory over that great defiant physical act upon which all classical ballet is delicately perched : turn - out .
( Contrary to common belief , true turn - out — the outward rotation of the legs so that the knees are pointing in 180 - degree opposition — is a pivoting in the hip socket , not in the knees or feet . )
One of the many ironies is that I lost the ability to turn - in : I was trapped turned - out .
Ha !
I suppose I thought that in keeping the bone after it was removed I was losing less somehow .
Not a very appropriate fear for a ballerina , for whom dancing is , by definition , a conscious act of loss .
A ballet dancer goes onstage on a given night , in a specific theater , in a specific ballet and executes , in a specific fraction of musical time a movement that is already past just as it appears .
And it takes far more than 10,000 hours of practice and repetition to make this movement exquisite , worthy .
A dancer ’s entire career consists of these moments of non-existence ; they are not even fleeting , they are , somehow , never there at all , a shadow in someone else ’s mind at best .
I first realized this at age seventeen , having already focused thirteen years on the pursuit of this particular kind of beauty .
I had just been chosen by Balanchine to join his company , and when finally dancing his ballets on his stage , the real task at hand became apparent .
I feared not having the courage to endure this kind of transience — this was spiritual work of a very high order ; the physical work paled beside it .
Terror sent me into a kind of scribbling frenzy in an attempt to salvage myself from what felt like complete extinction .
( Surely dancing is the saddest of the arts in its fragility — for architects , sculptures , painters , writers , composers , musicians , actors , their work resides legitimately outside themselves .
Not so dancers .
And do n’t talk to me about the two - dimensional horrors of video and DVDs ! )
So now , decades later , I envisioned a parched white Georgia O’Keefe bone , my eroded femur head , on a shelf in my house , a fossil , evidence of those millions of lost moments dancing , now solid , externalized .
Proof .
( Of what ?
God knows . )
Two weeks after surgery , as promised , Mrs. Wong , my doctor ’s office manager , called to say my bone was back from pathology and ready for pick up .
Well , the Georgia O’Keefe fantasy quickly vanished .
Sitting on Mrs. Wong ’s desk in an opaque quart - sized Tupperware container with a crooked orange hand - written label were pieces of something floating in formaldehyde .
She handed it to me , and suggested that if I was taking it on the airplane to California I should put it in my checked luggage so as to not concern security with the “ What is THAT ? ” question , not to mention the liquid it was in .
Once back from the hospital I gingerly opened the container : nothing in there looked remotely like anything from an anatomy book .
Now , Mrs. Wong had also told me that if I wanted to preserve my “ souvenir ” on dry land I needed to have a taxidermist extract the fatty tissues from the bone so it would n’t go rancid .
One hundred thousand dollars of medical bills and I still needed a taxidermist .
Back in Los Angeles
I let the Tupperware sit in its cocoon of bubblewrap in the corner of my dining room bureau for several weeks .
Finally I Googled “ taxidermists Los Angeles ” and came up with several places .
Game Master Taxidermy was the one closest to me .
It was already 10 p.m. but I thought I ’d call and see what information the recording would give me about hours and parking .
“ Hello , ” a man ’s voice said .
“ Oh , er , ah , sorry , ah— is this the taxidermist ?
I thought you ’d be closed … ”
“ Yeah , this is the taxidermist and yeah we ’re closed . ”
Images of him in some dark workshop drying out the dead late into the night came to mind .
I explained that I needed my recently removed hip bone “ treated ” in some fashion .
He warmed up a little .
It was illegal , he explained , for him to have human bones on his premises — at least the kind that are free - floating .
“ But I can tell you what to do .
It ’s very easy , ” he said cheerfully .
Here ’s the recipe he gave me :
Boil bones on the stove in plenty of water for one hour .
Drain and soak in cold water for 30 minutes .
Soak in a solution of 50 percent bleach , 50 percent water for twenty minutes .
Let dry outside in the sun
Well , I ’d come this far and I was n’t going to stop now .
But , what if , as they came to a boil , there was a smell ?
By now I had realized that step one was the same as making chicken broth and I wondered if I should have added a carrot and celery stick , a bay leaf and some whole peppercorns like my mother did .
Human broth .
What if my cats started yowling like they do when they smell chicken broth ?
But , I reasoned , I am not a chicken — and I was n’t going to avoid smelling it .
It was a rare opportunity .
I stuck my nose into the pot like Julia Child and inhaled deeply .
The aroma was mild and , well , not so bad .
As directed , I drained the pot into a colander observing , I ’m proud to report , very little fat on the surface of the liquid .
Less than with a chicken .
And no , I did n’t save the broth .
I ’m not crazy .
There on the bottom of my red plastic colander that had held so many strands of pasta was my hip .
Sort of .
This was the first time I had really seen the pieces not submerged in liquid .
I had to look in brief flashes to get used to it .
There was me , the inside on the outside , and it sure did n’t look pretty .
I had hoped to see the arthritis that had caused the end of my dance career at an age young even for a dancer .
I wanted to confront the enemy and see that it was real .
Even now , all these years later , I still think I should have been able to cure my injury , alleviate the pain and increase my motion with enough sleep , steak , cod liver oil , time , acupuncture , physical therapy , and Pilates .
Like a child , I thought my bad hip was my fault .
I wanted to face it now , to confirm somehow that I could not , with all the will in the world , have overcome it and danced again .
So there it was , the femur head in two halves ( pathology had cut it in half ) .
But there were numerous other pieces , bits , God knows what .
Yuck .
Maybe the bleach would , at least , turn everything white , purify it .
It did n’t .
And neither did the sun .
I have since brought my bones inside .
I ’m no longer scared of them , just curious .
They simply do n’t make any sense .
I can look at my X - ray and see what got taken out but there are many rough , asymmetrical , curved , chunky , twisted , strange pieces that do n’t fit .
When I showed them to Dr. Padgett during a check - up back in New York ( yes , I packed them up and took them on the plane back East again ) he wrinkled his nose and drew back — not exactly how you want your surgeon to react to your insides , especially the parts he removed himself .
He shrugged and said he had no idea what they were .
Jeez .
Then he explained that the smooth , mottled , marble - colored side of the femur head , the only part of the bone that was beautiful to me , was the “ arthritis , ” meaning the place where the cartilage was gone entirely : arthritis is an absence — pure , smoothed - down bone surface .
Inside the sliced bone it looked like honeycomb .
Maybe I ’ll glue the femur head back together so at least it looks more like a femur head .
For now an elastic band holds the two sides as one .
But the truth is that all the pieces do not fit together and they never will .
I guess they did n’t inside me either .
That was the trouble .
They sit now in a wooden box that belonged to Balanchine , that he painted himself , that I was given by Father Adrian who buried him .
Next to the box , I keep the last pair of pointe shoes I ever wore on stage .
The coffin of my career .
If what you crave is the smell of White Castle Sliders , now you can indulge your olfactory senses in your own home .
White Castle is selling special hamburger scented candles for its 89th anniversary all in the name of charity .
The candles sell for $ 10 and appear to be extremely popular .
The company 's Web site says it is sold out of the commemorative candles .
Money raised from the candle sale will go to Autism Speaks .
If White Castle can keep the candles in supply , the hamburger scent will be available through the end of May , which is also " National Hamburger Month . "
By the way -- if you 're thinking about buying the candle for the signature smell of White Castle , you might as well buy three and get the car air freshener that 's offered up for free with a $ 25 purchase .
Why Americans are angry
Last week , AFL - CIO President Richard Trumka went to Harvard to deliver a speech on why working people are angry .
It 's worth a read :
For a generation , our intellectual culture has suggested that in the new global age , work is something someone else does .
Someone we never met far away in an export processing zone will make our clothes , immigrants with no rights in our political process or workplaces will cook our food and clean our clothes .
And for the lucky top 10 percent of our society , that has been the reality of globalization — everything got cheaper and easier .
But for the rest of the country , economic reality has been something entirely different .
It has meant trying to hold on to a good job in a grim game of musical chairs where every time the music stopped , there were fewer good jobs and more people trying to get and keep one .
Over the past decade , we lost more than 5 million manufacturing jobs — a million of them professional and design jobs .
We lost 20 percent of our aerospace manufacturing jobs .
We 're losing high - tech jobs — the jobs we were supposed to keep . [...]
The fact is that for a generation we have built our economy on a lie — that we can have a low - wage , high - consumption society and paper over the contradiction with cheap credit funded by our foreign trading partners and financial sector profits made by taking a cut of the flow of cheap credit .
To think about this slightly differently , consider the way elites have treated the decline of journalism jobs and the decline of manufacturing jobs .
Both sectors are fundamentally suffering from the same thing :
A technological revolution that has made the large , well - paid workforces of yesteryear into a competitive disadvantage in the modern economy .
But where the decline of manufacturing was greeted with sanguine talk about " retraining , " the decline of journalism has been greeted with something akin to grief .
People notice that .
Now , this is n't to accuse anyone of heartlessness .
But " creative destruction " is n't easy to explain , and it's not very comforting to the destroyed .
The problem , however , is that it's a very comforting concept to the people watching the destruction .
It 's a license not to worry about the death of aging industries .
And the massive bubbles of the past decade or two made it easier to ignore the country 's economic problems , because the massive expansion of credit made people who were n't getting ahead feel more like they were , which blunted the sort of polling evidence and popular anger that could have gotten more elites worried about all this .
Meanwhile , when creative destruction came at a white - collar industry like journalism , people in the field justified their terror because journalism plays a more important function than simply giving people jobs .
But a lot of that terror has been about jobs , and understandably so .
And when it comes at other " knowledge " industries , you hear a lot of concern about America losing its edge in , say , green energy , or microchips .
So that also gets a special exemption from being written off as " creative destruction . "
You do n't want America to lose the future , do you ?
Elites are much better at being afraid of job losses in their world , but that has n't contributed to a broader sympathy or -- dare I say it ? -- sense of solidarity .
Meanwhile , the game in Washington proved itself rigged in favor of powerful interests when Wall Street cracked and the banks got bailed out .
So the economy can batter the working class and it's all part of the natural order of things , but the rich seem to get saved when things do n't go their way .
Why should n't people be angry ?
Taxpayers are paying £ 6 m so their children can be scared out of their wits .
It 's not Halloween , but a new climate change TV advertising campaign that begins tonight , which features a young girl watching a dog drown .
The ad campaign is put together by " Act on CO2 " , the cross - department publicity machine that describes itself as " the pre-eminent behaviour change brand on climate change communications across Government " .
Nature magazine simply calls it the Worst .
Climate .
Campaign .
Ever .
You can see it here .
The expensive campaign is designed as a response to increasing public indifference to Global Warming - but it may backfire .
Climate experts now say that alarmism does n't work .
Scare stories about runaway climate change might actually be causing Runaway Indifference .
Drowning Dog
Met Office climate modeller Vicky Pope has said apocalyptic predictions are misleading - " distorting " the perception of climate change .
She cited shock - horror press releases about recent Arctic ice melt , which she said could equally be explained by natural variation .
Weeping Bunny
Former head of the Tyndall Climate Centre Mike Hulme has criticised " climate porn " several times .
And recently scientists advised to give up on pointless gestures and turn to large scale adaptation and mitigation strategies .
Matthew Sinclair of the Taxpayers ' Alliance echoed the concern .
“ This is a disgusting attempt to use taxpayers ’ money to scare their own children , particularly when money is so tight following the recession , " he told us .
" Senior climate scientists like Pope and Hulme have criticised just this kind of attempt to intimidate people into supporting action on climate change .
The Government should not be using taxpayers ’ money to produce this kind of shock advertising , which would probably not even be allowed on TV if it was produced by an independent campaign . "
" It should only spend on advertising when it is essential to provide services , not trying to terrify people into seeing its point of view .
This advert should be cancelled , the advertising budget slashed and money saved for ordinary taxpayers . ” ®
Bootnote " Using one overarching campaign brand will help to minimise duplication of effort and maximise use of existing consumer resources across Government and beyond , " according to the Act on CO2 Toolkit .

What happens when Google swallows your life ?
A new hire at the internet company is blogging the experience , from waking in his Google apartment to taking a Google car to Google dinner and then Googling home via Google .
A Sun veteran , software developer Tim Bray was no stranger to big - company life .
But he knew Google enveloped employees on a whole other level , so after his recent hiring he vowed to blog his Google experience " while my eyes remain fresh . "
Bray 's writeup was friendly enough , but commenters could n't resist comparing the Googleplex to the totalitarian systems depicted in the movie THX 1138 , the book Brave New World and , most fashionably , in the TV show Lost , which features a crypto-military research project that calls itself " the Dharma Initiative . "
And no wonder : Google swaddled Bray from dusk til dawn :
Bray wakes up in his nondescript Google apartment in Mountain View , where he rooms with " a taciturn Czech " who is comically unwilling to discuss his " data security " work .
The lodgings are , presumably , temporary quarters .
Bray rides the Google Bus , enjoying Google Wi-Fi on his way to work , at Google .
Breakfast is at a Google café : " I lean to the Google bacon , fresh fruit , a little wee scoop of hash browns , and Google coffee , which is perfectly OK . "
The workday includes an example of Google 's maddening hiring process : Bray 's division sounds like it really needs to hire , amid a " ferocious ... head - to - head competition " with what can only be Apple , but the hiring committee rejects six of seven job candidates .
High standards !
" I 'm in awe , and as with many other things I see here , wonder if it can be sustained . "
Finally , a break from the old Google grind : A buddy shows Bray an " out of the way " sushi joint ... at Google .
Sigh .
At least it 's " across a couple of Google parking lots which I 'll never find again .
It was good .
They 're all good . "
Bray grabs a Google Prius to buy himself a new camera at Best Buy .
It 's free , just like the " Google - sponsored taxi " he took home from the airport when he got into town .
6:30 rolls around , so it 's time for dinner , taken with some office - mates on a picnic table outside a Google café .
Bray breathes life into his surrounding by carefully taking note of the " slanting California sun " and " knifing California breezes . "
Ya , that 'll get old .
Finally , a non-Google trip , to a " pseudo - Irish bar . "
But Bray can't resist checking his " Google email on my Google phone . "
Well , hey , at least there are some non-borgs out there who can empathize with that particular form of Google immersion .
Disclaimer : Bray adds in an update that " normal " Googlers do n't live like this , and there he 's been at companies where people arrived earlier and worked later .
So consider selling your Google stock , unless you 've managed to snare a cushy / creepy job at the company .

Are people who travel in town cars and on corporate jets different — on a psychological level — from you and me ?
Does the availability of luxury goods " prime " individuals to be less concerned about or considerate toward others ?
The answer from new research seems to be yes .
HBS professor Roy Y.J. Chua and Xi Zou , an assistant professor at London Business School , suggest that luxury goods have an important effect on human behavior that is only now becoming clear — and that may have implications for addressing the continuation of objectionable choices among , for example , high - flying executives on Wall Street .
According to Chua , their research found that " people who were made to think about luxury prior to a decision - making task have a higher tendency to endorse self - interested decisions that might potentially harm others . "
Their findings are detailed in the HBS working paper " The Devil Wears Prada ?
Effects of Exposure to Luxury Goods on Cognition and Decision Making " [ PDF ] .
" Will the same business meeting reach different decisions when it is held at a luxury resort as opposed to a modest conference room ? " the authors write .
" Will CEOs who bequeath themselves expensive office facilities and luxurious corporate jets make different business decisions than those who do not ?
In this age of Wall Street excesses , these are pertinent questions that could further our understanding of why some [ people ] continue to place their own interests over others ' , even in difficult economic times . "
Chua , whose research draws on human psychology to better understand important social processes in business organizations , explained more about the findings in an e-mail Q&A .
Sarah Jane Gilbert :
You conducted two experiments to explore a psychological link between the notion of luxury and self - interest .
What did you find ?
Roy Chua :
In the first experiment , participants were asked to answer a series of business - related decision - making questions that were designed to tap the extent to which people place self - interests ( profit maximization for one 's firm ) above society interests .
An example involved asking participants how likely they are to endorse the manufacturing of a new model of car that could bring in enormous profit but could potentially pollute the environment .
Before answering these questions , half of the participants were asked to evaluate luxury products , while the other half evaluated cheaper equivalents .
We found that people who were made to think about luxury prior to the decision - making task have a higher tendency to endorse self - interested decisions that might potentially harm others .
These results led us to wonder whether " luxury - primed " individuals are simply self - interested or are indeed more prone to harm others .
Thus , we conducted a second experiment that was similar to the first one in that the participants were either primed with luxury or not .
The difference is that after the prime , we asked them to do a word recognition exercise .
The task was to write down the first word that came to their mind when given a string of scrambled letters .
These strings of scrambled letters were each constructed by interleaving a pro-social word with an anti-social word of equal length .
Examples of the pro-social words used were nice , giving , and helpful ; examples of anti-social words were rude , stingy , and selfish .
We found that luxury - primed participants identified significantly fewer pro-social words than non-luxury - primed participants .
However , there was no significant difference in the identification of anti-social words .
This pattern of findings suggests that luxury - primed individuals were not more likely to have anti-social cognition , but were less likely to have pro-social thoughts .
In other words , when thinking about luxury , people tend to focus more on themselves and less on others .
Q : Did anything in your research surprise you ?
A : The findings are not so much surprising as illuminating .
We expected a relationship between luxury and self - interests .
However , self - interested behaviors are often conflated with those that do harm to others ( e.g. , selling low - quality products that might be harmful to consumers ) .
Our second study to some extent clarifies the psychological dynamics that arise from luxury .
Luxury does not necessarily induce one to do harm to others , but simply causes one to be less concerned or considerate toward them .
Q : How do your findings help us to understand corporate greed ?
Do you think there is a different mindset now for companies and executives to change and become more socially and morally responsible ?
A : In the midst of the current global economic crisis , people are outraged by highly paid executives living in the lap of luxury while continuing to make self - serving decisions and ignoring the plight of others .
To date , more than a year since the crisis started , despite much public outrage and threats to more strongly regulate the financial industry , there do not seem to be any substantive changes in their mindset .
Bankers are still planning large bonuses for themselves .
One commonly proffered explanation is that these executives lack a moral compass , leading them to care only about themselves to the extent of hurting others .
Our findings offer another perspective — the fact that these executives are surrounded by luxury did not help their decision - making to be more " other - oriented . "
Yet their seemingly " immoral " decisions stem not so much from a real desire to hurt others but more from over self - indulgence .
Perhaps besides limiting the size of bonuses , limiting corporate excesses and luxuries might be a step toward getting executives to behave more responsibly .
Q : Since your research is work in progress , do you have plans to expand your study to uncover additional findings ?
What would you include in future studies ?
A : Yes , this is still very much work in progress .
While our findings established the effects of exposure to luxury , we believe more work is required .
Future research should tease out the nuances in the psychological effects of " luxury prime " ( which we have shown to promote self - interest ) and " money prime " ( which has been shown to promote self - sufficiency and independence ) .
Toward this end , Xi Zou and I have recently completed a new study in which participants tested perfumes as part of an ostensible marketing research project .
Participants were divided into two groups :
In the first group , participants read about perfumes as luxury products , and in the second group , participants read about perfumes as becoming daily necessities .
Both groups tested the same perfumes .
We found that luxury - primed participants behaved in a more self - interested manner in that they were less likely to make contributions toward the public good .
Priming luxury did not have any effect on self - sufficiency measures , suggesting that priming luxury is different from priming money .
Future research should also examine the mechanisms through which luxury goods activate self - interests .
We posit that several potential mechanisms may be involved in the process .
Exposure to luxury goods may activate a social norm that it is appropriate to pursue interests beyond a basic comfort level , even at the expense of others .
It may be this activated social norm affects people 's judgment and decision - making .
Alternatively , exposure to luxury may directly increase people 's personal desire , causing them to focus on their own benefits such as prioritizing profits over social responsibilities .
Although these two mechanisms lead to the same observed results , they have distinct social implications .
As social scientists , we think it is important to understand the " why " beneath the effects we found , and so we are currently planning more studies .
Hi all ,
Wanted to post about the spotty service we 've had the past few days and last week .
Seems like we have been under some sort of sporadic attacks ( from small network subranges ) which spikes load making the site inaccessible .
If the site is down or responding very slowly , typically I will tweet from @SEQanswers , but as sequencing is a global activity , sometimes I 'm asleep or in a meeting and do n't tweet instantly .
With some help from my host and a security provider I hope I have addressed the issue in a robust way .
If the site is down or slow , and I 'm near my phone , I 'll know about it .
Thanks for your patience .
Online ' more popular than newspapers ' in US
Reading newspapers has become less popular in the US and UK Online news has become more popular than reading newspapers in the US , according to a survey .
It is the third most popular form of news , behind local and national TV stations , the Pew Research Center said .
" News awareness is becoming an anytime , anywhere , any device activity for those who want to stay informed , " it said .
Newspapers in the US and UK have been going through financial difficulties , leading many to examine charging for their news online .
The survey showed that news aggregators such as Google News and AOL were most commonly used , along with the websites of CNN and the BBC .
Changing habits
Sixty - one per cent of readers surveyed said they got their news online on a typical day , compared with 78 % from local news channels and 71 % from a national TV network such as NBC or cable channels such as CNN or Fox News .
Fifty - four per cent said they listened to radio news programmes at home or in the car .
More than 90 % use more than one method to get news , and 57 % consult between two and five websites as part of their newsgathering , the survey found .
The last print edition of the Seattle Post - Intelligencer was sold in March " Americans have become news grazers both on and offline - but within limits , " said Amy Mitchell , deputy director for the Pew Research Center 's Project for Excellence in Journalism .
" They generally do n't have one favourite website but also do n't search aimlessly .
Most online news consumers regularly draw on just a handful of different sites . "
Regular readers of newspapers - either local ones or national papers such as the New York Times - have dropped to 50 % , the survey said .
Newspapers on both sides of the Atlantic have been going through difficult times as advertising slows and more readers migrate to the internet .
The Seattle Post - Intelligencer was among many that closed last year , while the Chicago Tribune and San Francisco Chronicle have gone through huge job cuts .
In 2009 , the Daily Mail and General Trust cut 1,000 jobs at its regional arm Northcliffe Media , which publishes more than 100 newspapers in England and Wales .
Media tycoon Rupert Murdoch , the chairman and chief executive of News Corp , also shut down the London Paper and announced that his group of papers will charge for online news .
The group owns the Sun , the Times , the Wall Street Journal and the New York Post , as well as Fox and Sky brands .
Mr Murdoch has accused firms such as Google of profiting from journalism by generating advertising revenue by linking readers to newspaper articles .
The New York Times will also charge for access to the website by 2011 .

What are these ?
E-mail this to a friend Printable version
In November last year I stated that it would only be a matter of time before it happened .
Also in November Joel Webber , a Google engineer had the inspiration to port Quake II to HTML5 from Jake2 –a Java port of Quake II–using Google Web Toolkit ; the same toolkit used for writing Google Mail | Maps | Wave in Java and compiling into JavaScript .
With the help of two other Google engineers ( Ray Cromwell and Stefan Haustein ) in “ 20 % time ” , it works !
Just !
How Does It Work ?
â€ œGWTQuakeâ€ took Jake2 , and run it through Google ’s Web Toolkit ( a framework and compiler for writing web apps in Java ) to convert it to a collection of HTML5 Canvas / Audio / Video and JavaScript .
Jake2 however relies upon various Java interfaces that are not present directly in GWT or the browser , for example the networking , keyboard and file IO .
Joel had to implement new mappings to get the Java code to correspond to browser technologies .
For example Java uses asynchronous IO , but JavaScript is event driven ( onkeyup , onkeydown etc. ) .
â€ œStefan Haustein contributed new JRE classes to implement Java NIO Buffers around WebGL ’s new typed javascript arrays , as well as a GL renderer based around WebGL.â€ 
WebGL is an experimental technology to bring 3D to browsers using OpenGL ES , a cut - down version of OpenGL designed for embedded uses ( The iPhone uses OpenGL ES 2.0 for its 3D API for example ) .
Both Firefox and WebKit / Chrome nightlies currently support WebGL , but it may be some time before this technology reaches a release - ready state ( the specification is still in flux , a draft was issued in December 2009 ) .
WebGL revolves around the HTML5 Canvas element , which provides a rendering context that can be drawn into using JavaScript so that web pages may render images on a per-pixel basis .
Canvas was originally invented by Apple for use in the widgets in the Dashboard feature as part of Mac OS X Tiger .
The Canvas element has since been adopted and standardised by the HTML5 working group .
Firefox , Safari , Chrome and Opera all support the Canvas element .
It is not yet known if IE9 will support Canvas , despite committing to support for other HTML5 technologies like Video and Audio .
Another interesting HTML5 technology used is WebSockets .
This gives the browser the ability to open a two - way TCP connection to a server for a communication channel .
This is an improvement over AJAX , which is a synchronous request - response technology that has high latency , and much more robust than â€ ˜Comet ’ , a hack to make AJAX behave more asynchronously .
By using WebSockets , the web browser has the ability to channel data back and forth at high speeds and act more like a native application .
In this case , GWTQuake uses WebSockets to provide networking between client and server so that GWTQuake can even be played multi-player !
WebSockets , like WebGL are currently only supported on nightly versions of Safari / Chrome and Firefox .
Loading and saving of games in GWTQuake is done using HTML5 ’s Local Storage , it ’s a key : value store for web apps to hold more data than what can be fitted into cookies .
Google use this in their Mobile GMail web app for caching and offline access to data .
Unlike cookies , the data is not sent to the server on each request and it persists after cookies are cleared .
Therefore you do n’t have to download or upload files to load and save your games in GWTQuake , you just open the URL and choose load from the menu !
How Can I Play It ?
At the moment GWTQuake is only available by downloading and compiling the source code from the GWTQuake Google Code project site .
Both the OGG Vorbis tools and Lame are required to convert the Quake2 data into OGG Video and MP3 audio for use in the browser .
There are numerous issues , depending on what platform you are , but I managed to cobble together the following instructions for Mac OS X from comments from others on Google ’s instructions .
Install HomeBrew , to get Vorbis and Lame ( and Mercurial ) easily :
( Credit for these instructions goes to â€ œ64.brianâ€ ) sudo chown - R $ USER /usr / local curl - Lsf http://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/tarball/master | tar xvz - C/usr / local -- strip 1 brew install vorbis - tools brew install lame # if you do n’t have Mercurial , brew install pip && pip install mercurial Checkout the GWTQuake source ( requires Mercurial ) : hg clone https://quake2-gwt-port.googlecode.com/hg/ quake2-gwt-port
You may need to â€œcdâ€ into the quake2 - gwt - port directory now .
Maven runs out of memory compiling on OS X , fix this by using this command :
( Credit for this instruction goes to â€œredchrisâ€ ) export MAVEN_OPTS= - Xmx512 m
Compile , download the Quake2 demo , and run the server : ./build-dedicated - server ./install -resources cp -r maven - build / server / target/gwtquake/war/gwtquake war ./run-dedicated - server 8080
Play the game by opening http://localhost:8080/GwtQuake.html in your browser !
Browser Compatibility
At this moment , GWTQuake will only work on a nightly version of WebKit or Chromium .
Sorry , no Firefox support yet .
Apparently it is missing some feature that is required ( I know that Firefox supports WebGL , WebSockets and everything required in theory here , so I would n’t know precisely why it does n’t work without debugging it myself ) .
Google ’s browser compatibility page provides download links for WebKit , Chrome , and what command to run to enable WebGL ( which is off by default in both browsers ) .
Additionally , Chrome has to be run without the sandboxing otherwise it is very slow due to time wasted copying the framebuffer between processes .
Another major issue is that on most screens the game appears very dark .
This is because the original game did gamma adjustment on the textures as it loaded them and this was not ported as such to GWTQuake for efficiency reasons ( see the FAQ page ) .
For the screenshots I ’ve included in this article , I ’ve forced my screen ’s gamma to be 1.2 so that the screenshots are more visible .
How Does It Play ?
Surprisingly well , considering it ’s in a web browser !
There are a number of bugs .
When I loaded the game , there ’s just a black screen in Chrome , and the console text overprints itself .
Just press enter to bring up the game menu .
One rather cool aspect of the web -ness of the code is that the data loads asynchronously .
As you start a game , the textures load into view much like images in a regular web page !
In WebKit , I found that the objects in the game ( gun / enemies / other interactive objects ) flickered .
In Chrome I did n’t get any sound , but the flickering was gone .
In WebKit it was reporting about 7 - 10 FPS , though to be honest it felt significantly smoother than that ( nearer to 20 FPS maybe ) .
In Chrome , I was only seeing 1â € “ 2 FPS .
Ray Cromwell reports that â€ œOn WebKit / Chrome I can get 20 - 25 fps on a MacBook , and on my Mac Pro desktop , I get about 45 fps .
Joel reports that a Linux notebook gets up to 60 fpsâ€ .
Aiming can be sent a bit skewiff if your mouse pointer falls out of the browser window , so full screen is a must if you have any intention of playing properly .
Of course it should be understood that this is a ) highly experimental , and b ) highly - unoptimised .
The FAQ page notes that :
The original Quake II code was straight C , written in the mid-90’s .
The Jake2 port to Java was very direct , which preserved most of it ’s C-isms , including giant bags of static methods where C functions used to be .
In addition to this , we hacked and slashed our way through the code to get it going and reasonably optimized , but there was definitely some collateral damage along the way .
Considering that it was compiled from hardly ideal Java into JavaScript , it ’s still impressive performance .
If the game were written from scratch straight into JavaScript ( or even better , using Native Client ) , I suspect that performance would be much better .
What Does This Mean ?
It means that you should not assume that the web browser is just a document viewer , nor is it as slow as it used to be , and nor is it as incapable as it used to be .
However , none of the technologies in use here having left draft status .
I would put it at around two years before this technology ( and games using it ) arrive in the hands of the public via mainstream releases of Safari , Chrome and Firefox .
But those innovating will be ready to hit the ground running .
What this means for users in the long term is a great simplification and removal of many hurdles for users .
This is a 3D game that you can play just by visiting a URL .
No installation , nothing to download and install .
You â€œinstallâ€ the game by bookmarking it .
As simple as that .
URLs could even be constructed to point to specific rooms in multiplayer sessions , so that you could invite someone into a game in progress just by sending a URL through e-mail , IM or twitter and such !
There ’s been a lot of debate about HTML5 vs .
Flash , especially with the imminent release of the iPad ( which despite complaints from some does n’t seem to be having a problem getting some major users of Flash to jump ship to HTML5 ) .
Whilst HTML5 cannot fully replace Flash yet , the features are coming , and those features will even surpass what Flash can do .
Mozilla have demoed WebGL running on a Nokia 900 ; they decided to disable Flash by default on Firefox Mobile stating â€ œThe Adobe Flash plugin used on many sites degraded the performance of the browser to the point where it did n’t meet our standards.â€ 
Adobe have promised that Flash 10.1 will increase performance , but this wo n’t change the fact that neither the iPhone , nor the iPad include Flash .
Once a web developer writes content in a standards based way to work on the iPhone / iPad , why would they choose not to serve the exact same content to desktop users , and redo it all again in Flash ?
Quake II in HTML5 does not exist to somehow be a practical example of the technology .
It is to inspire developers to push the boundaries of what ’s assumed what browsers are capable of .
Compelling , graphical games and experiences can be delivered to users with nothing more than a URL , with all the freedoms of distribution the web offers ( compared to the App Store for example ) , across multiple OSes and multiple platforms and processors .
It will take many years for the availability of this technology to trickle down to devices everywhere , and many more years for the development tools to become readily available to all levels of skill ; but come they will , because the Internet is the new operating system .

Introduction
At CDFreaks we like TAGES protection a lot .
We were the first to explain the protection method they used on Motoracer 3 ( that we named ‘ twin sectors ’ ) and later we reused it to copy Securom .
Recently , we even contributed to their promotion .
Therefore , when after 2 years of silence we saw 3 new TAGES protected games coming in , it seemed natural for us to have a look at this new flavour .
ADVERTISEMENT
The goal of this article is to give a detailed explanation of both old and new TAGES authentication schemes , as well as various methods for twin sectors injection .
As an example , I will explain how I made a working backup of XIII CD2 and I will especially expose the reasoning behind the method , in the hope that some readers may benefit from it when investigating other protections .
Note that this is not a step - by - step method to copy XIII , but a technical article about the inner workings of TAGES and the methods to circumvent it .
History of TAGES
The TAGES copy protection system has been developed between 1999 and 2001 by two french companies , THALES ( a big electronics corporation , specialized in defence and aerospace ) and MPO ( a CD / DVD disc manufacturer ) .
Since 2003 , TAGES is managed by a brand new company called TAGES SA .
At the time of writing , 4 games are protected by TAGES :
MotoRacer 3 by Delphine Software ( 2001 )
Robocop from Titus Interactive ( 2003 )
Beyond Good & Evil and XIII from Ubi Soft ( 2003 )
Although it is common practice for copy protection companies to exaggerate their merits on their websites , TAGES SA is truly setting new standards in marketing bluff .
Not only are they pretending ( in red capital letters ) to be the toughest protection around , but they also picked up some quotes from various discussion forums to emphasize it .
Of course , these quotes have been carefully chosen to convince potential customers that TAGES is truly unbeatable .

Reality is a bit different though .
For instance Motoracer3 has been broken in every possible way : not only did we get the usual NoCD patch , but a working backup ( ISOs ) has been made by the Mojito group , using the twin sector method I will describe later .
Also a free tool ( T - Euro by MX450 ) is available to convert an MR3 Alcohol image into a working copy .
Finally , a Motoracer3 emulator has been written by puzzo ( even before the patched images were available ) .
Before looking if the new version is as unbeatable as the old one , let ’s first refresh our knowledge about these famous twin sectors .
Twin sectors
To prevent duplication of protected CDs , TAGES applies some physical modifications to the disc that we named ‘ twin sectors ’ .
A twin sector is a sector which has the same number and subcode address as an already existing sector , but different data .
Due to the inner workings of a drive , these twin sectors are not seen by copying programs ; therefore , by checking for the presence of such twin sectors , TAGES ensures that it is an original disc .
Any drive can read twin sectors and , more interestingly , any RAW - 16 compatible drive can write them .
Here ’s the sector layout of a typical TAGES protected disc :
After the original sector range 1400 - 1700 ( A ) another range of same size has been inserted , which contains different data ( B ) .
To access these two ranges , TAGES uses the fact that all CD drives use relative displacements for jumping to a given location .
Indeed , when a drive is instructed to read a given sector , it calculates an approximate distance ( based on the current and target addresses ) where to move the laser , moves it and read addresses again .
If the move was too short , the first decoded address will be smaller than the target one and the drive will seek forward .
If the move was too long , the drive will seek back .
This trial and error method goes on until the laser has reached a location close enough to the target address .
Based on these observations , the original TAGES method used seek - forward and seek - back tricks to access twin sectors , as described on the following picture :
If we read sector 1000 , we obviously force the laser to go to location 1000 .
If we next ask for sector 1500 , the drive will calculate and apply to the laser a forward move corresponding to +500 sectors , and will therefore reach sector 1500 in range A .
On the other hand , if we ask sector 1500 just after having read sector 2000 , then the drive will seek back of a distance corresponding to - 500 sectors and will get data from sector 1500 in range B. TAGES has been able to read different data from the same sector number and therefore considers that this is an original disc .
This method was used on Motoracer 3 and could be fooled by simply inserting the missing twin sectors in the image .
The new method is a bit different , as we will see now .
Eight steps to success
First of all , a quick check of XIII CD2 shows that it contains about 260 twin sectors from address 281165 to 281424 , so we can already dump them and keep the file for later .
Now if we start the game a few times and look at the drive accesses , we see something different from the old method : each time TAGES has to authenticate the disc , a different number of sectors with different addresses is read .
Obviously some randomness has been added to puzzle the casual observer .
Nothing to fear though , since a trained eye can easily cut through this pseudo - random fog and recognize patterns in these sequences , and from them deduce the authentication strategy .
Each authentication of XIII CD2 is made of 8 sequences , each one preceded by a read of sector 10h and a read_capacity command .
The disc authentication is successful if all 8 authentication sequences are successful .
Each one of these sequences shows some constant operations :
a first reading of sector 281412 .
This is a twin sector , and therefore data from range A or range B can be read .
a series of single sector read accesses alternatively between the twin and the normal range .
a final reading of several consecutive sectors , whose last read sector number is always equal to the third read sector number .
This authentication sequence is successful if the data read by the third and last sector accesses read belong to different ranges ( range A then B or vice - versa ) .
The address of this 3rd and last sector is always fixed for a given sequence number :
1 ) check 281203 5 ) check 281402
2 ) check 281204 6 ) check 281402
3 ) empty sequence 7 ) check 281402
4 ) check 281402 8 ) check 281212
Note that there are actually only 4 different sector read during these 8 sequences .
Here ’s now a sample log of sequence number 4 :
In this case , data from range A were read during the first access to sector 281402 and we see that only 3 attempts were needed to get data from range B . Note that after the 3rd read TAGES is not looking for the exact same sector number anymore , but for an address a bit before the target sector : in this case , the drive reached range B by reading sector 281397 , and then sequentially read sectors until 281402 .
The idea is that looking for the precise target sector is not needed because we know that if we keep reading sectors sequentially the next ones will also belong to the same range thanks to the drive ’s cache .
On the other hand , here ’s what happens with a normal copy of the disc :
The drive seeks back and desperately tries to reach a sector in range B , before giving up after too many retries : authentication has failed , so the game will still start but TAGES will slowly cripple it .
Note how the seek back distance continuously grows up , to increase the distance the drive has to travel forward just afterwards , and thus increase the probability of reaching range B .
First let ’s try the method that worked on Motoracer , i.e. inserting the twin range just after the normal one .
The image after this modification looks like this :
Then we start the game and … voila !
it does n’t work .
Just like a standard bad copy , graphics are crappy , mouse sensitivity continuously decreases , and enemies get extremely hard to kill .
When we look closer at what happened , we see that we passed checks 4 , 5 , 6 and 7 but failed the others : in other words , we were able to reach only twin sector 281402 .
Post Mortem
So we tried the old method and it failed : we exhausted our theoretical knowledge of TAGES and , as chess players say , we are now out of the book .
At this moment it might be tempting to randomly modify our CloneCD image and burn more CD - RWs , or even to fire SoftICE and IDA and tear the TAGES binaries apart .
On the contrary , it is the perfect time to shut down the PC , take a drink , sit comfortably and ponder .
Why is the old method working for sector 281402 and not for the other sectors ?
Alright , before trying to understand why it fails in some cases let ’s first make sure that we understand why it works for 281402 : when the drive seeks from 279xxx to 281402 , the laser is moved forward and lands somewhere in range A :
Depending on where exactly the laser lands , we can distinguish 3 cases :
if it lands in sub-range ‘ a’ ( between the address corresponding to the maximum negative error and 281402 ) , the address read will be lower than 281402 , and therefore the drive will seek forward and eventually reach sector 281402 from range A .
if it lands in sub-range ‘ b’ ( from address 281402 to 281424 ) , the drive will naturally seek back and again eventually reach sector 281402 from range A .
if it lands in sub-range ‘ c’ ( in the B zone , between 281165 and the address corresponding to the maximum positive error ) , the drive will consider that its move has been too short , and will therefore jump forward and get sector 281402 from range B .
So if the maximum positive seek error of the drive is larger than 22 sectors , then it has a chance to land in range B and therefore to reach our twin sector .
Now if we think about what happened for sector 281203 , the situation is very different :
Here we see only two sub-ranges , ‘ a’ and ‘ b ’ , which means that in all cases the drive will only get data from range A , either by seeking forward or seeking back .
So we know why the sectors 2812 xx fail the authentication : they are too far from the border of the B range , and therefore will never be reached by the laser .
Our goal is now clear : we should try to modify the image in such a way that the twin sectors stay close to the corresponding original sectors .
But as said before , trial and error method with our CloneCD image and CD - RWs is both time and media consuming .
However , we were able to explain why the previous image failed just by reasoning and without burning any disc .
Therefore , it should be possible to write a software model of TAGES protection , which takes as input a CloneCD image and gives us probabilities that it will be successfully authenticated .
Back to the keyboard , we therefore code a simulator of XIII authentication scheme .
If we use it on the previous image , it gives the following figures :
P( 281203 ) = 0.00 % P( 281204 ) = 0.00 % P( 281212 ) = 0.00 % P( 281402 ) = 56.00 %
which confirms what we observed and explained just before .
With this new weapon we should be able to beat TAGES .
Coup de grace
" It is a fact now and FOREVER , it is not just an opinion : we guarantee full immunity with 1:1 copy , since CD - Rs do not have our structural modifications , and a burner cannot do it ! " – TAGES website , 2004 .
" Perform a thoroughly zen_analyze before attempting deeper methods : do remember that you want to crack the protection scheme SOMEHOW , and not necessarily following the same line of thought that the programmer eventually WANTED YOU TO CRACK IT with . "
+ORC , 1996 .
This fundamental of the zen - cracking philosophy may look like simple common sense , but it is actually a deadly pitfall in which protectionists keep falling into .
It means that the strength of a CD copy protection based on physical modifications does not entirely depends on how difficult these modifications are to duplicate , but also on how well the software checks for their presence .
In the past several companies claimed that backups of their games were impossible because the physical modifications of the original disc could not be duplicated by a burner .
Such claims have already be been proven wrong for Safedisc ( amplification vs weak sectors ) and Securom ( TwinPeak vs DPM ) : we will now prove it wrong also for TAGES with twin sectors .
For XIII CD2 , this means that we will not waste our time trying to duplicate the 260 twin sectors , but only focus on creating an image that will make the software watchdog happy .
And all this lazy pet needs to be happy is 4 twin sectors , so these are the only ones we will focus on .
However we must also plan some twin sectors before these magic 4 , because the last burst access will only work if the first sector in the row is a twin one .
Also since the first 3 sectors are quite close from each other and the last one is close to 281412 ( which starts each sequence ) , we can group all our twin sectors in two ranges .
For instance we will try to inject two groups of 50 twin sectors , one from 281165 to 281214 and the other from to 281372 to 281421 .
Here ’s our new image :
Now we fixed the problem of the previous layout , since our two regions each important sector in the A range is close to its counterpart in the B range .
However , when looking at the results from our simulator , it seems that this is still not good enough :
P( 281203 ) = 76.00 % P( 281204 ) = 78.00 % P( 281212 ) = 94.00 % P( 281402 ) = 0.00 %
We now have good figures for the first group but the second one is failing .
A bit of debugging with the simulator gives the answer , as shown by the following picture :
Below our current sector layout you can see the theoretical sector addresses for the same physical locations on a normal disc .
The forward seeks are always performed from a location far before the twin range ( around 279500 ) , and as explained before all moves are calculated as relative distances based on the current location .
This means that when jumping from 279500 to 281402 the drive will move forward by a distance corresponding to 1902 sectors .
But since we already injected 50 twin sectors , it will actually land around a sector whose number is 281353 , so before the A range : the first group of 50 twin sectors we injected has increased the absolute location of the second one by 50 , preventing the drive from accessing it .
To restore the absolute location of the second range , we will simply get rid of 50 sectors in between the two ranges , since we know sectors in this region are useless .
After a bit of thinking , I decided to keep a 1/3 2/3 ratio of uniform regions between the two ranges , and therefore removed sectors 281249 to 281288 from the image .
By deleting these 50 sectors we have compensated the injection of the first 50 twin sectors , and now theoretical addresses again match actual addresses on the disc for both ranges :
This is our final layout , and our simulator looks pretty happy with it :
P( 281203 ) = 76.00 % P( 281204 ) = 78.00 % P( 281212 ) = 94.00 % P( 281402 ) = 88.00 %
And indeed we can now play XIII from our CD - RW backup .
This modified image worked very reliably on various types of drives , including a Plextor 2410A burner , a Samsung SD - 616 DVD drive , a Toshiba SD - C2402 DVD laptop drive and a Samsung SC - 148C SCSI CD - ROM drive .
Discs 3 and 4 use different ranges but can be copied with the same method .
The tools used to make this backup are available here ( 54 Kb ) .
Conclusion
Physical protections all come down to a very simple question : can we read more than we can write ?
In other words , can a drive reliably and accurately extract some information from a CD - ROM that a burner cannot write on a CD -R .
So far protectionists have not been able to give a definitive answer to this question , and this makes physical protections an open , largely unexplored , and very interesting battlefield .
The weakness which allowed us to make a backup of XIII definitely resides in its implementation , but it is worth noticing that TAGES is inherently weaker than its competitors .
Indeed , although it requires physical modifications of a disc , these only have an impact at logical level ( i.e. data bytes of a few sectors ) rather than at physical level ( angle , density , DSV , etc ) .
This makes TAGES very easy to emulate compared to Securom , CDCops or Starforce , and one can only wonder why Daemon Tools and Alcohol do n’t support it yet .
If need be , we will release our own stand alone TAGES emulator .
All in all , this new TAGES release does n’t bring anything really new and still lazily relies on its original twin sector idea .
After 2 years of development it seems that all the changes sum up to a new authentication method ( as badly implemented as the original one ) and a few awkward security improvements ( pseudo - random accesses ) .
TAGES requires some fundamental changes to become a really effective protection , especially against emulation .
Will the newly created TAGES SA be able to bring these changes ?
We shall know soon enough .

The World Cup kicks off in South Africa in mid-June
Football fans in north - eastern Kenya have criticised a decision by a Muslim leader to close public video halls ahead of the World Cup .
Many Kenyans watch live football in video halls via satellite because they cannot afford the technology at home .
But Sheikh Khalif Mohammed has shut the halls down in the town of Mandera , saying the satellite channels expose children to pornography .
The move has sparked anger in a nation where football is hugely popular .
The BBC's Bashkas Jugsodaay in Mandera says fans have told him they will do anything to watch the World Cup , which begins in six weeks ' time .
Some even said they planned to cross the crocodile - infested river Dawa to watch games in neighbouring Ethiopia .
" If the chiefs [ clerics ] do n't lift the ban , I will go anywhere for the World Cup - from the first day to the last day , " said a man who did not want to be identified .
Sheikh Mohammed said the video halls were a bad influence on local children and encouraged them to miss school .
" If anyone wants to go watch the World Cup at his house or her house then we have no problem .
But public - no , " he told the BBC .
This is where it all started .
John Ford ’s smash hit and enduring masterpiece Stagecoach revolutionized the western , elevating it from B movie to the A - list and establishing the genre as we know it today .
The quintessential tale of a group of strangers thrown together into extraordinary circumstances , Stagecoach features outstanding performances from Hollywood stalwarts Claire Trevor , John Carradine , and Thomas Mitchell , and , of course , John Wayne , in his first starring role for Ford , as the daredevil outlaw the Ringo Kid .
Superbly shot and tightly edited , Stagecoach ( Ford ’s first trip to Monument Valley ) is Hollywood storytelling at its finest .
The report ' Strategies to Reduce Sodium Intake in the United States , " issued by the Institute of Medicine ( IOM ) on April 20 , 2010 , announced the request for new federal standards of salt within foods by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) .
The chair of the Committee on Strategies to reduce Sodium Intake , a part of the Institutes of Medicine , made a statement at the news conference to announce the report .
Dr. Jane E. Henney , a professor of medicine at the University of Cincinnati ( Ohio ) , stated in the WebMD article Experts Urge FDA to Mandate Salt Reduction , '' If you look at salt intake over a number of decades , it has not gone down despite a number of efforts and it is still at a very high level . ' The WebMD article also provides a discussion on the other side of the story '” from the salt industry and other related industries , which does not want to be told to reduce salt from foods .
Please read the WebMD article ' Experts Urge FDA to Mandate Salt Reduction , ' as mentioned above , for more information on both sides of the debate as to whether to voluntarily reduce salt from foods or to mandate it by the FDA .
Page two concludes with additional information from a Medical News article on why salt ( sodium chloride ) is a growing problem in the United States and elsewhere .
The April 21 , 2010 Medical News article Nutrition experts call for sodium reduction strategies states : ' Sodium is a major culprit in our nation 's epidemic of high blood pressure - a disease that can start in childhood and will afflict nine out of 10 Americans over the course of their lifetimes .' ' A 35 percent reduction in Americans ' average daily sodium intake could save billions of dollars annually on health costs - and save upwards of 90,000 lives - by lowering people 's blood pressure , and in turn , their risk of heart disease and stroke . '' But achieving this will take a comprehensive , population - wide effort , one that includes federal leadership to create a level playing field so that all food companies can move in concert toward gradual , steady reduction of sodium levels . '
Citizens Classed as Jewish or Arab Nationals
A group of Jews and Arabs are fighting in the Israeli courts to be recognised as “ Israelis ” , a nationality currently denied them , in a case that officials fear may threaten the country ’s self - declared status as a Jewish state .
Israel refused to recognise an Israeli nationality at the country ’s establishment in 1948 , making an unusual distinction between “ citizenship ” and “ nationality ” .
Although all Israelis qualify as “ citizens of Israel ” , the state is defined as belonging to the “ Jewish nation ” , meaning not only the 5.6 million Israeli Jews but also more than seven million Jews in the diaspora .
Critics say the special status of Jewish nationality has been a way to undermine the citizenship rights of non-Jews in Israel , especially the fifth of the population who are Arab .
Some 30 laws in Israel specifically privilege Jews , including in the areas of immigration rights , naturalisation , access to land and employment .
Arab leaders have also long complained that indications of “ Arab ” nationality on ID cards make it easy for police and government officials to target Arab citizens for harsher treatment .
The interior ministry has adopted more than 130 possible nationalities for Israeli citizens , most of them defined in religious or ethnic terms , with “ Jewish ” and “ Arab ” being the main categories .
The group ’s legal case is being heard by the supreme court after a district judge rejected their petition two years ago , backing the state ’s position that there is no Israeli nation .
The head of the campaign for Israeli nationality , Uzi Ornan , a retired linguistics professor , said : “ It is absurd that Israel , which recognises dozens of different nationalities , refuses to recognise the one nationality it is supposed to represent . ”
The government opposes the case , claiming that the campaign ’s real goal is to “ undermine the state ’s infrastructure ” — a presumed reference to laws and official institutions that ensure Jewish citizens enjoy a privileged status in Israel .
Mr Ornan , 86 , said that denying a common Israeli nationality was the linchpin of state - sanctioned discrimination against the Arab population .
“ There are even two laws — the Law of Return for Jews and the Citizenship Law for Arabs — that determine how you belong to the state , ” he said .
“ What kind of democracy divides its citizens into two kinds ? ”
Yoel Harshefi , a lawyer supporting Mr Ornan , said the interior ministry had resorted to creating national groups with no legal recognition outside Israel , such as “ Arab ” or “ unknown ” , to avoid recognising an Israeli nationality .
In official documents most Israelis are classified as “ Jewish ” or “ Arab ” , but immigrants whose status as Jews is questioned by the Israeli rabbinate , including more than 300,000 arrivals from the former Soviet Union , are typically registered according to their country of origin .
“ Imagine the uproar in Jewish communities in the United States , Britain or France , if the authorities there tried to classify their citizens as “ Jewish ” or “ Christian ” , ” said Mr Ornan .
The professor , who lives close to Haifa , launched his legal action after the interior ministry refused to change his nationality to “ Israeli ” in 2000 .
An online petition declaring “ I am an Israeli ” has attracted several thousand signatures .
Mr Ornan has been joined in his action by 20 other public figures , including former government minister Shulamit Aloni .
Several members have been registered with unusual nationalities such as “ Russian ” , “ Buddhist ” , “ Georgian ” and “ Burmese ” .
Two Arabs are party to the case , including Adel Kadaan , who courted controversy in the 1990s by waging a lengthy legal action to be allowed to live in one of several hundred communities in Israel open only to Jews .
Uri Avnery , a peace activist and former member of the parliament , said the current nationality system gave Jews living abroad a far greater stake in Israel than its 1.3 million Arab citizens .
“ The State of Israel can not recognise an ‘ Israeli ’ nation because it is the state of the ‘ Jewish ’ nation … it belongs to the Jews of Brooklyn , Budapest and Buenos Aires , even though these consider themselves as belonging to the American , Hungarian or Argentine nations . ”
International Zionist organisations representing the diaspora , such as the Jewish National Fund and the Jewish Agency , are given in Israeli law a special , quasi - governmental role , especially in relation to immigration and control over large areas of Israeli territory for the settlement of Jews only .
Mr Ornan said the lack of a common nationality violated Israel ’s Declaration of Independence , which says the state will “ uphold the full social and political equality of all its citizens , without distinction of religion , race or sex ” .
Indications of nationality on ID cards carried by Israelis made it easy for officials to discriminate against Arab citizens , he added .
The government has countered that the nationality section on ID cards was phased out from 2000 — after the interior ministry , which was run by a religious party at the time , objected to a court order requiring it to identify non-Orthodox Jews as “ Jewish ” on the cards .
However , Mr Ornan said any official could instantly tell if he was looking at the card of a Jew or Arab because the date of birth on the IDs of Jews was given according to the Hebrew calendar .
In addition , the ID of an Arab , unlike a Jew , included the grandfather ’s name .
“ Flash your ID card and whatever government clerk is sitting across from you immediately knows which ‘ clan ’ you belong to , and can refer you to those best suited to ‘ handle your kind ’ , ” Mr Ornan said .
The distinction between Jewish and Arab nationalities is also shown on interior ministry records used to make important decisions about personal status issues such as marriage , divorce and death , which are dealt with on entirely sectarian terms .
Only Israelis from the same religious group , for example , are allowed to marry inside Israel — otherwise they are forced to wed abroad — and cemeteries are separated according to religious belonging .
Some of those who have joined the campaign complain that it has damaged their business interests .
One Druze member , Carmel Wahaba , said he had lost the chance to establish an import - export company in France because officials there refused to accept documents stating his nationality as “ Druze ” rather than “ Israeli ” .
The group also said it hoped to expose a verbal sleight of hand that intentionally mistranslates the Hebrew term “ Israeli citizenship ” on the country ’s passports as “ Israeli nationality ” in English to avoid problems with foreign border officials .
B Michael , a commentator for Yedioth Aharonoth , Israel ’s most popular newspaper , has observed : “ We are all Israeli nationals — but only abroad . ”
The campaign , however , is likely to face an uphill struggle in the courts .
A similar legal suit brought by a Tel Aviv psychologist , George Tamrin , failed in 1970 .
Shimon Agranat , head of the supreme court at the time , ruled : “ There is no Israeli nation separate from the Jewish people . …
The Jewish people is composed not only of those residing in Israel but also of diaspora Jewries . ”
That view was echoed by the district court in 2008 when it heard Mr Ornan ’s case .
The judges in the supreme court , which held the first appeal hearing last month , indicated that they too were likely to be unsympathetic .
Justice Uzi Fogelman said : “ The question is whether or not the court is the right place to solve this problem . ”
Posted by John , April 20th , 2010 - under Jean - Paul Sartre , Sartre .
“ Every existing thing is born without reason , prolongs itself out of weakness , and dies by chance . ”
Thus wrote Jean - Paul Sartre in his 1938 novel Nausea , of which the revolutionary socialist Victor Serge said simply that it had “ an appropriate title . ”
Sartre , who died 30 years ago this month , went on to become the 20th century ’s most prominent French philosopher and public intellectual .
He built his fame on the kind of unremitting expressions of existential angst that arts students are apt to mistake as proof of what deep thinkers they are .
“ It is absurd that we are born , it is absurd that we die ” , Sartre wrote in his 1943 philosophical magnum - opus Being and Nothingness .
“ Hell is other people ” , laments one of the characters in his 1944 play No Exit .
So what interest does a figure like Sartre hold for the socialists and the activists of today ?
Perhaps surprisingly , the answer is quite a lot .
Sartre was an immensely popular thinker among the radical French youth of the 1960s generation .
In contrast to the kind of ornamental post - modernist intellectuals who occupy the commanding heights of the global knowledge industry today , and whose idea of activism is more likely to involve “ deconstructing ” a leaflet for a rally than actually attending one , Sartre ’s life and work was characterised by a deep and passionate commitment to change .
Sartre lived through some of the most significant events in the history of the 20th century .
Born in 1905 , his first political memory was of the Russian revolution of 1917 .
He studied in Berlin from 1933 to 1934 , in the years immediately following the ascension of Hitler and the Nazis to power .
Between 1939 and 1945 he first served in the French army , was then captured by the Germans and held for nine months as a prisoner of war , and following his release in 1941 was a founding member of the underground resistance organisation “ Socialism and Liberty ” .
In the decades following the war he was a leading participant in the radical movements that culminated in the uprising of French students and workers in May 1968 .
And Sartre died in 1980 , the year the Solidarnosc movement erupted through the seemingly impenetrable crust of Poland ’s Stalinist bureaucracy , signalling the beginning of the end for the repressive regimes of the Eastern Bloc .
But Sartre ’s political commitments were not merely a product of the times .
Rather , they were grounded in a deep sense of alienation from the norms of mainstream ( bourgeois ) French society .
Even in his early , more purely existentialist phase , Sartre ’s works express some basic truths about capitalism that , while not explicitly political as stand - alone ideas , nevertheless can function as a kind of intellectual provocation , opening a path towards some potentially “ dangerous ” conclusions .
Two basic features stand - out from the overall existentialist vision .
The first is the sense of disorientation and despair brought about by the lack of any fixed source of meaning for our lives .
As Sartre put it in his 1946 essay “ Existentialism is a Humanism ” : “ Doestoevsky once wrote : ‘ If God did not exist , everything would be permitted ’ ; and that , for existentialism , is the starting point . ”
This is a condition that was analysed by Marx in the Communist Manifesto , where he discussed the need for the bourgeoisie to constantly revolutionise the means of production , and society as a whole , in the pursuit of ever increasing profit .
With the development of capitalist society , “ all fixed , fast - frozen relations , with their train of ancient and venerable prejudices and opinions , are swept away …
All that is solid melts into air , all that is holy is profaned , and man is at last compelled to face with sober senses his real conditions of life , and his relations with his kind . ”
The second feature of Sartre ’s existentialism is its emphasis on the isolation of the human subject in the face of the immense natural and man-made forces that make up the objective world .
On the one side there is the individual human existence .
On the other , there is the stultifying silence and indifference of things .
In between there is a gaping chasm of “ nothingness ” – the source of our freedom , but also of the angst we feel as the bearer of a responsibility for a self that is ours and ours alone .
Once again , the echoes of Marx ’s theory of alienation are unmistakeable .
In the 1844 Manuscripts Marx described how , as a result of our capacity to labour being harnessed by a force that is alien to us and over which we have no control ( i.e. capital ) , we feel increasingly disconnected from the people and things that comprise our world .
As Friedrich Engels put it in The Condition of the Working Class in England , under conditions of capitalist production “ the dissolution of mankind into monads , of which each one has a separate principle , the world of atoms , is carried out to its utmost extreme . ”
Is it any wonder then , that in the context of the ascendancy of fascism in Italy , Germany and Spain , and the associated barbarity of the Second World War , existentialist novels such as Nausea and philosophical works like Being and Nothingness had such an immediate and dramatic impact ?
But Sartre ’s work did more than just express a sense of despair in the face of a seemingly meaningless and absurd existence , for it was also , as he saw it , a philosophy of action .
His reasoning was as follows : humans are distinguished by the fact that , in contrast to inanimate objects , they have no pre-existing essence or purpose that determines how they should be .
As Sartre himself puts it “ man is nothing else but that which he makes of himself .
That is the first principle of existentialism . ”
We are condemned , as it were , to be free , and we cannot evade the full force of the moral dilemmas we face in choosing how we want to live our lives .
In addition , according to Sartre , such freedom is not to be interpreted in purely selfish and egotistical terms .
For our personal choice of how we exist cannot but imply an ethical ideal that , more or less consciously , we believe others should follow .
As Sartre puts it , “ one ought always to ask oneself what would happen if everyone did as one is doing . ”
But perhaps the most important step in Sartre ’s account comes in answer to the question of whether , on the basis of his existentialist approach , it is possible to pass judgement on the actions of other human beings .
According to Sartre we can , and this is because of the fundamental act of self - negation involved in seeking to advance one ’s own interests at the cost of the freedom of others .
To act in a way that oppresses , exploits or generally restricts the freedom of another is ( following the principle of imagining the consequences if everyone acted in the same way ) to create , or rather to choose , a kind of society in which the same restrictions could easily be turned back onto oneself .
The basic moral imperative implied by Sartre ’s existentialism is therefore to seek to promote greater freedom for self and others in everything we do .
As Sartre puts it “ when once a man has seen that values depend upon himself , in that state of forsakenness he can will only one thing , and that is freedom as the foundation of all values . ”
It is this last point that provided the philosophical starting - point for Sartre ’s long political involvement with the radical left .
For in the context of capitalist society there was certainly no shortage of violence , exploitation and oppression to oppose .
Sartre ’s participation , during the Second World War , in the resistance group “ Socialism and Liberty ” has already been mentioned .
At the end of the war in 1945 he launched Les Temps Modernes ( Modern Times ) – a journal that aimed to provide a voice for the independent ( including anti-Stalinist ) left .
In 1948 Sartre joined with former Trotskyist David Rousset and various other activists from the social democratic , non-Communist and Trotskyist left to form the “ Revolutionary Democratic Assembly ” , whose founding statement declared that : “ Between the rottenness of capitalist democracy , the weaknesses and defects of a certain social democracy and the limitation of Communism in its Stalinist form , we believe an assembly of free men for revolutionary democracy is capable of giving new life to the principles of freedom and human dignity by binding them to the struggle for social revolution . ”
During this period Sartre came under increasing attack from the French Communist Party ( PCF ) , who saw him as a threat to its hegemony , particularly in the ranks of intellectuals and students .
In 1947 , the prominent Communist writer and philosopher Roger Garaudy published a book about Sartre and others entitled Gravediggers of Literature .
Sartre responded with characteristically sardonic wit , saying simply that “ gravediggers are honest people , certainly unionised , perhaps Communists .
I ’d rather be a gravedigger than a lackey . ”
However , in 1952 , during a period when the PCF was suffering from increasing repression at the hands of the French government following mass demonstrations against NATO , Sartre announced his “ agreement with the Communists on certain precise and limited subjects , reasoning from my principles and not from theirs . ”
Sartre has been heavily criticised for his brief period of allegiance to the PCF , which lasted only until 1956 .
And there is no doubt that he made himself complicit in various ways with the crimes committed by the Stalinists , particularly through the publication of a series of articles expressing a highly uncritical view of Soviet society and making outright dishonest claims about the freedom of criticism permitted there .
But we should bear in mind the peculiar difficulties of the circumstances in which he was operating , as suggested by his 1947 observation that “ the majority of the proletariat , strait - jacketed by a single party , encircled by propaganda which isolates it , forms a closed society without doors or windows .
There is only one way of access , a very narrow one , the Communist Party . ”
And while this does n’t excuse Sartre ’s actions during this period , it at least gives some sense of the complexities of his motivations .
Sartre ’s final move away from the PCF began in 1955 , when Les Temps Modernes committed itself to opposition to the French Government ’s war in Algeria , at a time when the only active campaigning on this issue was by a handful of anarchists and Trotskyists .
In contrast , in 1956 the PCF voted in favour of ‘ special powers ’ for the Government to deal with the situation .
Following the Russian invasion of Hungary Sartre made a decisive break , denouncing the intervention and declaring that socialism “ is not brought at bayonet point ” ( later , following the 1968 Russian invasion of Czechoslovakia , Sartre went so far as to speak of “ Soviet imperialism ” ) .
It was Sartre ’s role in supporting national liberation movements in Algeria , Vietnam and elsewhere that really cemented his position as an icon for the “ new left ” that emerged in Europe during this time .
He made many statements against the brutality of colonial oppression and in support of resistance , with the most compelling example being his 1961 preface to Franz Fanon ’s The Wretched of the Earth .
Commenting on the sanctimonious denunciations of the violence of the oppressed , Sartre wrote :
“ it is not their violence , it is ours , which turns back on itself and rends them …
It is the moment of the boomerang , it is the third phase of violence ; it comes back on us , it strikes us , and we do not realise any more than we did the other times that it ’s we that have launched it .
We have sown the wind : he [ the peasant fighter ] is the whirlwind …
If violence began this very evening and if exploitation and oppression had never existed on the earth , perhaps the slogans of non-violence might end the quarrel . ”
In other words , as Sartre saw it , the violence of the Algerian , Vietnamese and other national liberation movements was a clear cut case of the chickens coming home to roost .
So Sartre ’s legacy as a political activist is , despite a number of significant missteps , overwhelmingly positive .
He is a figure that , contrary to the arguments of some recent critics , who would like to dismiss him as straightforward apologist for Stalinism , can and should be claimed for the socialist left .
However , with regards to his philosophical legacy , the picture is somewhat less clear .
As Sartre saw it , the basic principles of existentialism , rather than being counter - posed to Marxism , provided fresh insights into the human condition that could be used to enrich and extend it .
In particular , following his break from the Communist Party in 1956 , he came to see his role as one of rejuvenating the libertarian and critical spirit of Marxism , which had been crushed under the weight of Stalinist totalitarianism .
Thus in a 1975 article , Sartre recalled that “ writing The Critique of Dialectical Reason represented for me a way of settling accounts with my own thought outside of the Communist Party ’s sphere of influence over thought .
I felt that true Marxism had been completely twisted and falsified by the Communists . ”
Sartre seems to have had a limited success on this score .
As British socialist Ian Birchall , who as an activist of the 1960s generation was strongly influenced by Sartre ’s work , has written “ certainly in the period after 1956 …
Sartre made an important contribution to the rebirth of Marxism as a critical and radical method of thought rather than a sterile dogmatism . ”
However , the extent to which Sartre succeeded in his endeavour to reconcile existentialism with Marxism is questionable .
The Critique of Dialectical Reason is a long and difficult book and to provide a thorough analysis of its merit as an ( avowed ) work of existential - Marxism goes well beyond the scope of this article .
Suffice to say that Sartre ’s focus on the individual subject , even when seen in the context of a pre-existing world of people , things and relations , seems to lend itself to an abstract and undialectical approach to politics that goes against the basic tenor of Marxism .
After all , in contrast to existentialism , the starting point for Marx was neither the existence nor essence of the individual human being , but rather the “ ensemble of social relations ” that comprise society as a whole .
One might conjecture that Sartre ’s focus on individual choice and action was , in the absence of a clear understanding of the broader dynamics of capitalist society , a significant contributing factor to his sometimes quite dramatic political errors of judgement .
Nevertheless , it is important to maintain a sense of perspective on this .
For while Sartre ’s engagement with politics was a little hit - and - miss , at the very least his philosophy drove him to take a stand against the injustices of capitalist society , in the process exposing himself to criticism of all those lackeys , of both pseudo - left and rightist varieties , who would rather apologise for them .
As Raya Dunayevskaya has commented :
“ whether one viewed Sartre ’s Existentialism as the only true philosophy of freedom or considered it the false consciousness which disoriented a whole generation of revolutionaries , one thing no one doubted : Sartrean Existentialism was not enclosed in an ivory tower , and by its identification of Freedom with Revolution it maintained its hold on the youth . ”
And this , finally , is much more than can be said about the post - modernist windbags who dominate the academic world today .

By Patrick Craven , COSATU national spokesperson
April 6 , 2010 -- The Congress of South African Trade Unions ( COSATU ) condemns the brutal murder of Eugene Terre ’Blanche on April 3 , 2010 , and sends its condolences to his family .
Murder and violent assaults can never be condoned , even against your worst enemy .
His killing however highlights the following issues :
COSATU will remember Terre ’Blanche as an enemy of democracy , a racist and a fascist .
His Nazi AWB tried to sabotage our transition to majority rule , when they forced their way into the World Trade Centre when our democracy was being negotiated , and when they invaded Bophuthatswana to defend a hated Bantustan system our people had rejected [ in 1994 ] .
He was also typical of the worst type of employer on South Africa ’s farms .
The reported circumstances of his murder speak volumes about the appalling state of labour relations on farms .
The alleged killers were farm workers -- one of them 15 years old and therefore employed illegally -- demanding unpaid wages of a paltry R300 a month ( US $ 40 / Aus$ 45 ) .
While their alleged violent actions cannot be excused , they illustrate the depth of many farm workers ’ frustration at their deplorable working conditions .
We assume that these two young workers were so desperate that the only way they could see to get justice was to allegedly bludgeon their boss to death , an act we are condemning outright .
The police and courts must enforce the law in this case , but also revisit the numerous outstanding cases where farm workers and dwellers have been shot -- often under the blatantly false excuse that they were mistaken for dogs , baboons or warthogs -- had dogs set on them , been thrown into lions ’ enclosures or evicted from the homes on to the roadside in the middle of winter .
Most farm workers have to work for wages way below the minimum laid down by the Sectoral Determination , often from dawn to sunset without any compensation , and frequently on public holidays and even polling days .
They suffer racial insults , assaults , evictions and murders .
A survey of COSATU members in 2000 revealed that 25 % of African workers said that their employer discriminated by race and one in seven said they had experienced racial abuse at work .
That was a survey across all sectors , but there is abundant evidence that it is worst in the agricultural sector , where labour relations on many farms are still feudal , unchanged since the days of apartheid , with the employers predominantly white and the workers overwhelmingly black .
A master and slave relationship continues .
It is not uncommon for Department of Labour inspectors to be barred from entering farms .
Only 3 % - 4 % of workers are trade union members .
As numerous reports from COSATU ’s North West provincial secretary Solly Phetoe confirm , the farmers are very often hand - in - glove with the local police , courts and government officials , who collude to let criminal farmers off the hook when they are charged with racist crimes .
No such leniency is exercise when workers and the poor farm dwellers are charged with crimes .
In some areas the situation is aggravated by the employment and super - exploitation of immigrant workers , who are treated even worse , especially illegal immigrants who can be reported to the police if they do not toe the line .
This in turn stokes resentment amongst other workers whose jobs are under threat .
No once have we seen COPE [ Congress of the People party , a right - wing slpit off from the African national Congress ] president Mosioua Lekota in any of the farm workers ’ marches to demand justice for the victims of these racist and violent killings and assaults .
He has never been at any funeral of these victims or visited the grieving parents of victims of these widespread acts of violence .
Yet he found time to visit Terre ’Blanche ’s farm .
One of the ANC ’s top priority areas is land reform and rural development .
It must now be the ANC and government ’s top priority to transform the lives of the farm workers and dwellers , by vigorously enforcing the labour laws on the farms , helping COSATU and its affiliate Food and Allied Workers Union ( FAWU ) to recruit and organise farm workers and to speed up the very slow process of land redistribution .
COSATU and government are organising provincial farm workers ’ summits over the coming weeks , leading up to a national summit later in the year .
The issues are how to enable farm workers to enjoy the fruits of democracy and laws that protect their rights , and to rescue them from the racist slavery under which most of them suffer at the present time .

Attacks against farm workers and their families
By Solly Phetoe , COSATU North West Province secretary
April 7 , 2010 -- The Congress of South African Trade Union and its affiliates are strongly disturbed at the program of racial attacks led by farmers .
It is really disappointing to continue to get public statements of denialism of brutal racial assaults and killings .
Poor farm workers and their families are mauled by lions and nothing happens .
Farmers in the North West are used to assaulting and killing workers by assaulting , and then alleging that workers were stealing ; and they are being supported by police .
The killing of the AWB leader is one of cruelest things that has happened in the province .
But more than a hundred farm workers and their families are brutally assaulted and killed almost every week , every month .
On April 6 , 2010 , at Lichtenburg a farmer called Van Rensburg assaulted six of his farm workers .
When we exposed them they called us racists .
The same farmer was not arrested until COSATU intervened .
This is due to the relationships of farmers , the police and the Department of Justice .
When workers report their case they are turned back .
COSATU North
West will not keep quiet , will not be intimidated , victimised or threatened by the Democratic Alliance [ South Africa 's main opposition party , composed of former the white parties under apartheid ] leaders , Congress of the People [ right - wing split from the ANC ] or Agri-NW [ provincial agriculture department ] .
We shall continue to expose all those cases of racial assault and killings against farm workers and their families .
COSATU demands that the provincial commissioner release all statistics of cases of assault and killing of farm workers that were reported to the police in the North West Province .
The Department of Justice is called on also to release details of cases that are in court and tell the public why there is no prosecution on almost all cases that involved white farmers , and why some of the cases are dragging on for more that two years in court without prosecution or trial , for example :
Johan Nel in Lichtenburg killed a young boy in October 2008 .
Farmers in Swartruggens assaulted and killed farm workers , but the cases were withdrawn even before the could appear in court .
Farm workers and their families were mauled by lions in 2005 , 2007 and 2008 , but these cases are still in the roll .
Others were withdrawn without informing the families .
The Department of Agriculture replaced the life of a human being with R60,000 , e.g. Tshepo Gaorupi in Tosca killed by nine lions the case was withdrawn .
A farm worker was killed in Bosdam in June 2009 , until now no postmortem result , no trial , no arrest .
Workers are killed , evicted and everybody is quiet , including our provincial and national government .
Farm workers have not enjoyed the 1994 breakthrough or the democratic process .
Therefore COSATU demands that the government or politicians must not take sides .
We must all take responsibility of what has happened both in the killing all farm workers and farmers .
COSATU demands full safety for all farm workers in the province , in 2008 , 2009 COSATU demanded unity in government to deal with this critical issue , in 2010 we submit that we must establish a provincial task team with all stakeholders .
Agric -NW refused and government agreed with progress .
Cases were reported in the following areas :
Wolmaranstad
Lichtenburg
Brits / Madibeng
Swartruggens
Ventersdorp
Koster
Schweizer - Reneke
Bloemhof
Chistian
Ganyesa
Stella
Zeerust
Tigane
In all these areas there are brutal assaults , killings and human rights abuse cases that have been reported by workers .
Brown sauce is an institution on both sides of the Atlantic but there are those who say its proponents ought to be confined to one .
Which sauce bottle do you reach for ?
Brown sauce .
As names go , it 's hardly a winner .
It evokes – let 's face it – chocolate slurry , the sewery gush , the eventual way of all meals .
But despite this , it 's welded itself into the western psyche .
Every supermarket on both sides of the Atlantic has a chestnut imitation , every roadside caff its littering little sachets .
Most Brits – perhaps especially during election week – associate it with HP .
The brand accounts for 71 % of the UK brown sauce market , and is also the most popular with Canadians .
In America , with somewhat unimaginative specificity , the equivalent is A1 Steak Sauce , dolloped almost entirely on beef .
It 's almost shocking how delicious HP is .
From its lowbrow reputation and unappetising hue bursts a remarkable aroma : complex , fuggy and fruity , like swimming through compost and Jif .
It tastes better than it smells , too , a sweet - sour , subjugating blend .
In truth , I never expected to like it - ours was a ketchup family – although in Edinburgh , where I grew up , every chippie uses brown sauce let down with vinegar as the " salt'nsoss " for its fish or haggis suppers .
A Nottinghamshire grocer concocted the primordial recipe in the 1870s using ingredients thrown up by empire : tamarind , dates and molasses .
He registered the name HP Sauce in 1895 , cannily claiming that Parliament had started serving it , and decorating his bottles with the now - familiar lithograph of the Commons .
A nearby vinegar manufacturer bought both recipe and brand in 1903 for £ 150 , and the rest is proverbial .
( There is no evidence in the sauce 's official history to support the claim that the name comes from the initials of a Mr Harry Palmer , a gambling addict who sold his recipe for " Harry Palmer 's Famous Epsom Sauce " to cover his debts . )
The sauce caught on quickly .
HP 's rival , the horribly named Daddies , began production in 1904 , and by 1940 brown sauce was so well known that the ever brand - conscious Betjeman could write in the poem Lake District : " I pledge her in non-alcoholic wine / And give the HP Sauce another shake . "
Harold Wilson , his wife blabbed to the Sunday Times , would " drown everything in HP Sauce " – and though in fact the PM preferred Worcestershire Sauce , he knew that a reputation for liking HP lent him man - of - the - people cred .
For much of the 20th century , HP 's octagonal bottles were bedizened with French drivel about the sauce 's digestive qualities , and when the company abandoned these European pretensions in 1984 readers wrote to the Times bewailing " the loss of that much loved and most piquant of French primers – the label on the HP Sauce bottle " .
If , like me , you do n't remember that miniaturised textbook , Marty Feldman sang it in a reasonable parody of Jacques Brel .
A glance at HP's Facebook fanpage highlights two things : the simplicity of the dishes it accompanies and the homesick internationalism of its fans .
Brown sauce is one of the most teary - eyed expat foods – a Proustian goo thick with memories of home and home cooking .
Jamie Oliver is a fan , and Sam Mendes loves it so much he plugged it in his otherwise dreary film Road to Perdition .
They may not make it here in the UK any more – there was a rightful outcry when production moved to Holland – but HP remains wholly British in spirit : " The Official Sauce of Great Britain " as a former strapline had it .
The sauce is proof that this country enjoys strong flavours and layered complexity in its food as much as any other nation , and the brown stuff will always remain the best complement to one of our greatest offerings to the world : the full English breakfast .
So what do you think ?
Was it mother 's milk to you , or can you barely stand the stuff ?
Should we , like the Americans , slop it on steak ?
And most divisively of all , where do you stand in the great bacon butty debate : ketchup or HP ?

What ’s in a name – Tips for naming your startup
Finding the right name for your company can be a long an laborious if not even costly task .
There are however a couple principles that can help you along .
Back in the days , drug when I was a young and hopeful rock - star , check we always struggled with finding a perfect name for the band .
It always created the odd discussion that was more kindergarten than university .
Well , pharm we were young and restless , what can I say .
The main problem was that we always tried to come up with a name that would be as great as the bands we idolized , Faith No More , Metallica , Megadeth , Winger , WhiteSnake , Prodigy , Kinky Boot Beast all great names right ?
Well no .
In retrospect we were wasting our time , valuable time , that could have been used to make music .
As I later learned , what made these names great were not the names themselves , but the music behind the names .
The names were merely identifiers of great music , not the other way around .
To witness , Metallica is a pretty ugly name , when you look at it from an intellectual point of view – “ we play metal so lets call ourselves Metallica ” .
An agency would probably never have come up with a name like that , unless it was meant as a joke .
But Metallica is a great band , and we still accept their overdone chrome logo and overdone name , in fact we do more than that , we love it ( well those of us who like their music at least ) because it represents something we appreciate .
This might sound obvious when you think about it , but I am still puzzled by the naming game to this day .
Many people still have the same idea about naming their start - up or product as we did back then .
Conventional wisdom says that you need a great name to let the greatness of your product really shine , but in my experience , great names are the byproduct of great products not the other way round .
Zyb.com was named Zyb because that was the only 3 letter .com domain name they could get at the time .
Zyb was later sold to Vodafone .
Definitely not because of their great name , but because of their great service .
Moving forward Zyb will be called Vodafone People ( see pressrelease ) .
Flickr.com is also one of those names that came into being by accident .
The owner of Flicker.com did n’t want to sell so they went with something that phonetically sounded like the real deal .
The success of Flickr spawned a whole new breed of companies , who along with gradients , drop shadow , round corners and other web 2.0 bling - bling , registered names for their phonetic character rather than their grammatical correctness .
In short , great names emerge from the great products they are associated with not the other way round .
Be prepared to kill your darlings .
There are no perfect names only great products .
So here are a couple of observations that might help keep your cool when deciding on a name :
It ’s harder to make a decision about what name to choose than to come up with one .
Therefore , find a name that says something about your company or product or something about you .
That way it ’s easier to make that decision .
It ’s nearly impossible to decide between StarFish and StarFlash if your company does music application .
There is no inherent quality in either of them .
Its easier to figure out whether you should choose StarTune , StarFish , FlashTune or StarFlash .

To verb or not to verb .
Yes we would all love that our company or product became so popular that it would change into a verb .
When everybody walks around and say “ just google it ” or “ I will skype you ” is n’t that indicators of success ?
Yes , but do n’t bet on it to happen for your own company and do n’t waste to much time trying to find a name that can be turned into a verb .
If your product is a success of that magnitude people will find a way to “ verbify ” your name .
After all we do n’t twitter each other , we tweet each other .
Concentrate on finding a name that you like , your success will take care of the rest .

Concentrate on finding a name that you like , your success will take care of the rest .
Do n’t get to caught in the quest for the holy .com extension .
If your product is great , people will find it .
Besides most non-techy people use the actual search field in google when they want to look you up .
Even more will get to your page by clicking on a link from somewhere else .
Last.fm is a good example of a company with a domain extension that are not obvious .
Also DropBox only recently acquired dropbox.com before that the domain name was actually getdropbox.com .
Be creative and do n’t worry too much about breaking the conventions .
As long as your company does well , people will find you and put the effort into remembering or bookmarking your name .

If you are not in the business of domains no domain name is worth more than $ 50.000 .
Business.com was sold for $ 7.5 Million in 1999 then $ 350 Million in 2007 .
Needless to say these are the exceptions and you will be hard pressed to argue for any price above $ 50.000 unless you are also buying access to users .
If you are a start - up there is no need to spend much more than $ 5000 .
Remember what has value is your product not your name .

Your name is not your brand , interface is brand .
To conclude .
Your brand cannot make your product better , only you can make your name better .
By making sure that your customers and users get good experiences when they interact with you , your name will gain value .
Therefore concentrate on your customer service , optimizing the service , providing superior experiences and maximum utility and your name is well on it ’s way to be the perfect name you wanted it to be .
Helpful links :
Make allies with one of the many great domain name tools and services out there .
Here is a great list from the ever relevant Smashing Magazine .
If you need to do bulk search you can also download this little perl - script our CTO Benny Johansen did for me .
It was done because I got frustrated with the challenge of finding a proper name and checking if it was available .
We often have a couple of hundred names we need to check so you can imagine how tedious that can be .
The script is very simple and you can put it everywhere you want and launch it through your terminal window .
You just create a list with the names you want to be checked ( domainlist. txt ) , set which domain extensions you want it to check ( topleveldomain.txt ) and then type : perl checkdomains.pl then the script will make a whois check and filter those names available into a new list ( domainsavailable .txt ) .
It does n’t become much simpler than that .
Hope this was useful .
Update1 : Vineet from http://www.architexa.com pointed me to http://www.pickydomains.com/
which use crowdsourcing to help you find the right name .
go check it out .
Update2 : A lot of people seem to be commenting ( and understandably so ) on the name of my blog some suggesting 000 fff should be blue with a tad of green .
# 000 #FFF translates into black and white so that is what I was aiming at , but in the spirit of my blog post I stand by it :)

Please read the next paragraph before watching the ROCK VIDEO .
On the ROCK VIDEO , the World Trade Center is mistakenly called the ROCKEFELLER PLAZA .
The WTC was conceived and promoted by the Rockefellers .
The Rockefeller Plaza is to the north of the World Trade Centre , on the MANHATTAN ROCK , or MANNA STONE .
The WTC and the Rockefeller Plaza , along with the area of CENTRAL PARK , relate to the TEMPLE MOUNT in Jerusalem , and the Al Aqsa Mosque , the Dome of the ROCK , and the Temple Courtyard .
These in turn relate to the North American West Coast .

MIRACLE ON THE HUDSON
January 15 , 2009 , US Airways AIRBUS 320 crash landed into the HUDSON River in New York .
It appears that the airplane flew into a FLOCK OF GEESE , disabling both engines , forcing the plane to make an emergency landing in the Hudson River .
This event took place precisely 5 days before the inauguration of Barack Obama as 44th president of the USA .
The pilot was Captain C.B. SullenBerGer , ( a B and G name ) .
The Captain did a magnicifent job of landing the plane , saving all 155 people on board .
On the same day , on the Kuril Islands , near the Kamchatka Peninsula , Russia , at almost exactly the same moment , a 7.4 magnitude earthquake occurred at 47 degrees N. and 155 degrees E . The numbers 47=11 on the 4th clockface and 155=11 on the 13th clockface .
The number 13=1+3=4 , indicating 2 - number 4 ’s , in the year of the 44th president .
13 also coincides with 1 , symbolic of the New Age .
Likewise 4+7=11 and 1+5+5=11 .
These numbers would , of course , appear to be just coincidental except for the fact that they ’re based on the characteristics of a beam of light , which itself , is simply an illusion .
Therefore , these number combinations are meant to perpetuate the illusion , and implant suggestions within our subconscious minds , thereby establishing our illusory reality .
Some of the images from the Hudson River plane crash are shown below .
This event took place very near to the Financial District of Manhattan .
The plane is seen below , with the Freemasonic Statue of Liberty in the background , situated beside ELLIS ISLAND .
This is in the vicinity of BATTERY PARK City , on the lower edge of Manhattan .
Also present in this photo , is yet another hypnotic sigil magic marker known as the Stars and Stripes , or the Star Spangled Banner , the flag of the USA .
ELLIS ISLAND = ELIJAH or ELIAS or ELI the Messiah
STAR SPANGLED BANNER = Egyptian God NUT / NIGHT gathering the DEAD unto herself
The World Trade Centre attack occurred on September 11 , 2001 .
The ‘ Miracle On The Hudson ‘ took place on January 15 , 2009 – 88 months after 911 .
This was the 3rd plane aimed at New York and demonstrates the ongoing nature of the next and last 911 , already in progress .
New York coincides with Los Angeles as demonstrated by reversing the North American Craton ROCK , and the name NEW YORK refers to the NEW ROSE , or NEW AGE that will rise out of the desired luciferian world cataclysm .
This plane , landing as it did on the Hudson , which symbolically relates to the Pacific Ocean , is establishing the suggestion that CALIFORNIA should be inundated .
On page 1 of this site , the relationship to the 1st two planes used in the WTC attack , relate to Towers 1 and 2 , that in turn relate to OREGON and ARIZONA , 2 names implying ORION .
Another bit of symbolism that comes to mind with the downing of Flight 1549 , is the sinking of the TITANIC .
The Titanic was named after the old Greek deities who were defeated by the younger generation of gods , led by ZEUS .
See the symbolism connecting Flight 1549 and the sinking of the Titanic the state of California and the coming 2010 OLYMPICS in Vancouver / Mount Olympus Washington ( approximately 4 charts lower down the page ) .
The Statue of Liberty is built on a base of an 11 Pointed Star .
The number 11 has been associated with Death throughout this site , and the suggestion here , is that LIBERTY COMES THROUGH DEATH .
Without death , according to all Sun / Son God worshipping religions , there can be no resurrection and freedom from the bonds of sin .
For this reason , the new presidential limousine also includes the license 44 , symbolizing 4 - 11 ’s , or death based on the 4 square foundational characteristics of a beam of light .
The new limousine is a GM Cadillac , not a Lincoln as previously stated .
The information regarding the limousine obtained on the internet conflicted with the actual car used in the inauguration ceremony .
However , a Cadillac , carries with it , symbolism as well .
Here ’s a bit of information about the CADILLAC that adds yet another touch of subliminal suggestion to the confusion regarding the limousine brand used by Barack Obama .
( Thanks to Chris for this ) .
Cadillac is a brand of luxury vehicles owned by General Motors .
Cadillac vehicles are officially sold in over 50 countries and territories , with the majority sold in the United States , Canada and Mexico .
In the mid-20th century , the name became a synonym for “ high quality ” , used in such phrases as “ the Cadillac of watches , ” referring to a Rolex .
Cadillac ’s current slogan is Life .
Liberty .
And The Pursuit. , in reference to the inalienable rights stressed in the United States Declaration of Independence .
1776 / 2 = 888
Cadillac was formed from the remnants of the Henry Ford Company when Henry Ford departed along with several of his key partners and the company was dissolved .
With the intent of liquidating the firm ’s assets , Ford ’s financial backers , William Murphy and Lemuel Bowen called in engineer Henry M. Leland of Leland & Faulconer Manufacturing Company to appraise the plant and equipment prior to selling them .
Instead , Leland persuaded them to continue the automobile business using Leland ’s proven 1 - cylinder engine .
Henry Ford ’s departure required a new name , and on August 22 , 1902 , the company reformed as the Cadillac Automobile Company .
Leland & Faulconer Manufacturing and the Cadillac Automobile Company merged in 1905 .
The Cadillac automobile was named after the 17th century French explorer Antoine Laumet de La Mothe , sieur de Cadillac , who founded Detroit in 1701 .
In a strange sort of way , the Cadillac is connected to a Ford , which in turn is connected to a Lincoln .
There ’s always a subliminal attached for why things unfold as they do .
We ’ll just watch and wait to see what this one reveals .
CADILLAC = KA life / death force – DI Die – LLA LA or Allah – C sea
GM = EYE AM = I AM
CADILLAC = KA-DIE -LAC = Death Milk
Lincoln was assassinated in the FORD ’S THEATRE .
John Kennedy was riding in a FORD LINCOLN limousine when he was assassinated on 11/22/1963 .
FORD = FOR DEATH
ASSASSIN = HASHASHIN Shia Muslim term
Its all about symbolism and subliminal messaging when it comes to the luciferian mind .
Without these tools of deception , they have nothing .
The whole automobile industry has been perpetuated for the most part by Freemasons .
The Interstate Highway System of the USA was established by the efforts of men such as Henry Ford .
It is no small coincidence that the Transportation Systems of the world are referred to as TRANCE PORT A SUN systems .
The ability to transport in a 3 dimensional perspective , solidifies the belief in SPACE and TIME .
The ability to transport faster , higher , farther , even to the moon and beyond , completely seals the notion that time and space are real .
9 -11 ’s All Over The Place
The numbers 9 and 11 and 4 , or 44 , or 8 , are very much in vogue at this point in the luciferian hypnotic agenda .
Here ’s another that defies logic completely .
Barack Obama was born on August 4 , 1961 , making him 47 years old as of January 19 , 2009 , one day before his inauguration .
Michelle Obama was born on January 17 , 1964 , making her age 45 .
Obama ’s August birthday makes him a LEO , or LION KING , and subliminally suggests LINCOLN , LLIONNC , or LION KING .
August is the 8th month , the number of control .
The 4th day relates to the 4 square foundation , and the 44th presidency .
45 = 4+5=9 and 45 coincides with 9 on the 4th clockface .
47 = 4+7=11 and 47 coincides with 11 on the 4th clockface .
Two birthdays coinciding with 9 and 11 on 4+4 clockfaces , or 44 , or 4+4=8 .
As well , 9+11=20 which coincides with 8 on the 2nd clockface .
The next US CONGRESS will be the 111th with Barack Obama as High Priest .
He began his Senate experience in the 109th Congress , and his Presidency with the 111th .
A bit more symbolism that links the World Trade Centre attack and the inauguration of Barack Obama to Abraham Lincoln is seen in the Lincoln Memorial itself .
Remember , the people involved in the political and intellectual maneuverings of the luciferian agenda , are more in the dark than anyone , and for the most part , have n’t the foggiest notion what ’s transpiring .
Intellectualism is the darkest state of being .
The Lincoln Memorial ’s strongest influence in design was based on the DORIC style of the TEMPLE of ZEUS in Olympia Greece .
Olympia Greece is located at 37 degrees North , just as San Francisco , the symbolic location of the Lincoln Memorial , is also at 37 degrees North .
The Olympic gods , led by Zeus , form a major portion of subliminal messaging in regards to the luciferian agenda for total control .
The Lincoln Memorial is referred to as a memorial , but in reality is a TEMPLE to a god , and that god is Abraham , or Janus , or Zeus , or any number of mythical deities exhibiting FATHER LIKE , or RABBI ( RABBIT ) like characteristics .
Incidentally , speaking of RABBITS ( or BUNNIES ) , Playboy Magazine just published their 55th Anniversary issue on January 2009 .
The number 55 =sacrifice 5×11 .
Playboy moved from Chicago to Los Angeles , just as other symbolic aspects of the luciferian agenda have done , either in direct , or symbolic fashion .
The DORIC COLUMNS of the Lincoln Temple , echo the 2 faced God Janus , the god of DOORWAYS , Hallways , Corridors and Gateways .
This symbolically suggests that Janus , or Lincoln , the LION , will open the GATE , or DOOR , symbolized by the GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE , that will allow the WATER and EARTHQUAKE to proceed from the LIONS GATE BRIDGE in Vancouver / Mount Olympus Washington , site of the 2010 Olympics , at some time in the future .
The 36 COLUMNS represent the DOVE COLUMBE or HOLY SPIRIT , the LIVING WATER , of the Queen of Heaven , Mary , or Maria , that will Cascade down through the Golden Gate following the Cascadia Ridge Subduction Zone and the Cascade Mountain Range .
Each column is 44 feet high .
This being the year of the 44th High Priest who will occupy the White House Temple , which itself coincides with Yellowstone / Holystone Wyoming , the 44th state to join the UNION , it seems more than fitting that the Columns should be 44 feet high .
Furthermore , the Lincoln Temple site was chosen 100 years before the World Trade Centre attack , in 1901 .
At that time it was SWAMPLAND , or land saturated in WATER .
The land around the Lincoln Temple , including the Tidal Basin were purposely designed in the shape they are to coincide with the west coast of the 11 Western States , and showing where the inundation of water will occur in California and Arizona .
On February 9 , 1911 , the Temple received authorization to proceed , 100 years before the FREEDOM TOWER is set to open in New York City , which will replace the World Trade Centre Columns .
The Lincoln Temple finished construction on May 30 , 1922 , 90 years before the Summer Olympics take place in LONDON .
Once again , its only fitting that the height of the Lincoln Temple is 99 feet high , echoing the 9 – 11 ’s of September 11 , 2001 .
Furthermore , this height is symbolic of the 99 names that the Islamic faith has for God .
This Temple is located on 23rd Street North West , symbolic of the the Pacific Northwest , and Mount Olympus Washington and the 2010 Olympics .
The number 23 coincides with 11 , the number of death .
2+3=5 , the number of sacrifice .
Also on display for Barack Obama ’s inauguration will be Lincoln ’s topcoat and top hat .
This symbolizes the magic of al - Buraq , Muhammad ’s Magic Horse , and the Wabbit , Rabbit father god , of the children of Abraham .
The 36 columns also have 20 conCAVE flutes ( Well of Souls ) representing CONTROL in the DORIC fashion .
The number 3+6=9 , the FALL .
The Titanic – Titans – Olympians – California
The symbolism in regards to the downing of Flight 1549 is associated with the sinking of the Titanic that links to California and once again , the Financial Crash throughout the world .
In turn , being that the Financial District of New York was centred around the World Trade Centre at the ROCKeFELLER PLAZA , which again , is patterned after Foundation ROCK on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem , Flight 1549 connects with all these aspects .
The night of April 15 , 1912 , saw the Titanic hit an iceberg and eventually sink at 2:20 am .
220= 2×11 .
At that time , just 6 miles away , the SS CALIFORNIAN , a YELLOW FUNNEL SHIP , captained by STANLEY LORD , had not responded to flares sent up by the TITANIC just after midnight .
YELLOW = YELLOH = HOLY
Yet another YELLOW FUNNEL SHIP was in the area called the SS MOUNT TEMPLE .
Once again , this ship did n’t respond to the flares or wireless signals from the TITANIC .
The wireless call signal for the SS Californian was MLQ = MLK = MILK .
The Californian was sunk by a German U - Boat on November 11 , 1915 .
Another 11 - 11 , in the year of the deity , 15 .
Both of these ships , the SS CALIFORNIAN and the SS MOUNT TEMPLE were launched in 1901 , 100 years before the World Trade Centre attack .
This is the same year the site for the Lincoln Memorial was selected .
The Californian , and the Mount Temple symbolize the 11 Western States , the Foundation ROCK under the Dome of the ROCK which is situated on the TEMPLE MOUNT in Jerusalem .
The connection of both these ships to the desired luciferian flood which is to originate in the Northern Arctic waters of Canada is evident in that , the Mount Temple was owned by CANADIAN PACIFIC LINES , ( CP SHIPS ) , and the Californian was captained by STANLEY LORD .
This name , STANLEY LORD , is the reverse of LORD STANLEY , a Freemason , who lends his name to the world famous STANLEY PARK located right at the LIONS GATE BRIDGE in Vancouver , the site of the 2010 Olympics .
This is the same LORD STANLEY that the NHL HOCKEY LEAGUE trophy , the STANLEY CUP is named after .
The acronym NHL = NILE , which in turn symbolizes the Global Warming Flood .
This game of ICE HOCKEY simply refers to EYE SEE , or the WAY , the name of god YAHWEH , the WAY of the WATER , and the term HAWK EYE , yet another symbol of Zeus .
As seen on page 34 , the name STAN , as in PakiSTAN , etc. , is an Arabic term that symbolically suggests the name SHAITAN .
Shaitan is the Arabic term for Satan , or knowledge , and to be enlightened .
Lord Stanley was a Freemason , supposedly one of the ‘ enlightened ’ believers in the All Seeing Eye , and his name suggests the LORD SATAN LAY .
Taken yet one more step , it suggests , Lord Satan LA , or ALLAH , which again , is simply suggesting to our subconscious mind , the City of Los Angeles , or LA .
Flight 1549 was a 320 AIRBUS , and flares from the Titanic were seen once again at 3:20 am .
Just another coincidence .
The Titanic was an OLYMPIC CLASS passenger ship , and Vancouver will be the site of the 2010 Winter Olympics .
The Winter Olympics are crucial to establishing the illusory future events , as they deal exclusively with SNOW , WATER , and ICE .
All necessary components for conjuring up an illusory flood .
Another ship near the Titanic that night , was the CARPATHIA , which picked up passengers from the Titanic , now in life boats , and took them to New York to CHELSEA PIER 54 . ( 54-4+5=9 ) .
The captain of Flight 1549 was CHESLEY B. SULLENBERGER III , echoing the Chelsea Pier in New York .
Yet again , Captain CHESLEY
Sullenberger was lives in Danville , California .
The image of the TITANIC sinking , one which most remember from the movies , and old newspaper clippings , is that of the ship launching up into the air , then breaking in two , with one section longer than the other .
This image relates to the angle of California , the 135 degree angle of the Dome of the ROCK , and the angle of ORION ’S Constellation .
The break in the ship coincides with the area from Lake Tahoe , to Sacramento , to San Francisco .
Which in turn points to the DOG STAR SIRIUS , which relates to HAWAII , or HAWAH , or HIGH WATER , and is the direction the DOG GOD , called BARK , or BARACK , came from on his trek to Washington .
The break in the ship extends from East to West , the same direction as the crack on the Foundation ROCK that goes from San Francisco to Las Vegas .
In both instances , the WATER pours into the BROKEN ship and BROKEN state of California .
Interestingly enough , the state of California is suffering from an economy that ca n’t meet its bills .
California is BROKE .
Below is a mock - up of a ‘ Future Map of America ’ after the Global Warming Flood occurs .
( Thanks to Mike for finding this one ) .
Take note of the water covering California , Oregon , Nevada , Utah and Arizona .
( This hearkens back to George Straits song ‘ Ocean Front Property ( in Arizona ) ’ , where he ’ll throw the Golden Gate in for free ) .
Also the areas along the whole west coast and those areas surrounding Hudson Bay .
As well , more water is present in the Mississippi region , from the Gulf up towards Lake Michigan and the earthquake region of Cairo Illinois , once called ‘ Little Egypt ’ .
BIG BROWN STRIKES AGAIN !
When the Pope visited New York in 2008 , the timing of his visit with the Kentucky Derby , the Preakness Stakes and the Belmont Stakes , coincided with the Myanmar / Burma Cyclone and the Sichuan China Earthquake .
The Pope ’s visit also coincided with the visit of the Dalai Lama to the USA .
One very notable sports story that also occurred during these visits , were the accomplishments of a horse called BIG BROWN .
This horse won the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness Stakes with ease .
In both instances , the Mayanmar / Burma Cyclone and the Sichuan Earthquake almost simultaneously transpired with these events .
Yet again , BIG BROWN has risen to the occasion , in the most hideous of ways .
A BIG BROWN flock of GEESE flew into the engines of Flight 1549 and downed the airplane .
The plane made a soft landing on the Hudson River with virtually no injuries .
( There ’s nothing softer than GOOSE DOWN ) .
At approximately the same time of the day , on the Kuril Islands of Russia , it was now January 16 , 2009 ( due to crossing the International Date Line ) .
At 3:49 , exactly 16 minutes after Flight 1549 came down , an earthquake magnitude 7.4 struck the Kuril Islands .
The East coordinate was 155 degrees .
There were also 155 people on Flight 1549 .
What ’s curious here , is that , 5 days before the inauguration of Barack Obama , the 44th President , who so openly emulated Abraham Lincoln , the 16th President , an earthquake strikes 16 minutes ( 4×4 ) after the plane comes down at 3:33 ( 3×111 – Obama to preside over the 111th Congress ) , on the 16th ( 4×4 ) of January , and the time of the earthquake is 3:49 ( 3+4+9=16 ) , at 7.4 magnitude ( 7+4=11 ) .
All these coinciding numbers revolve around the Hudson River , right at the doorstep of the old World Trade Centre site , which coincides with the Pacific Ocean symbolically .
The Pacific Ocean coincides again , with the Potomac River at Washington DC , with the Lincoln Memorial on its banks , which coincides with the area around San Francisco , California .
( As shown on the chart just above , demonstrating the sinking of the Titanic , California now coincides with the events surrounding the Titanic ) .
Every one of these events includes water , the notion of sinking , lost riches as in a financial crisis , and the possibility of , or actual death occurring .
But not just occurring anywhere , but all symbolically point to California .
CALIFORNIA = LAC-IF -ORIAN = MILK OF ORION
LAC is the term referring to LACTOSE in MILK .
Also called MILK SUGAR or SUGAR of MILK .
The constellation Orion glows with a bright white , and is the inspiration , along with the Milky Way , for the name of the White House and a multitude of other geographical ‘ White ’ locations throughout the world .
Along with the Milky Way , the Nile in the Sky , symbolizing the Great Flood , Milk is the sacred symbol of the ages that embodies the characteristics of the luciferian hypnotic flood .
Those characteristics include MILK and HONEY , or the CRYSTALLINE SUGAR ONLY FOUND IN MILK , called LACTOSE .
We ’ve all heard of LACTOSE INTOLERANCE among some people in society .
This is suggesting the Great Flood .
CRYSTALLINE = CHRIST AL NILE = CHRIST LA NILE the river of god in Los Angeles
The sacred symbol that provides this MILK is the COW .
Cow ’s Milk is 4.7 % lactose .
The chemical formula for LACTOSE = C12 H22 O11 = 12 fullness of time – 22 , 2×11 or death ( coincides with 10 for intensity ) and 2+2=4 square foundation .
And 11 = death .
As well , 12+22+11=45 which coincides with 9 on the 4th clockface .
4.7 = 47 = 4+7 = 11 or 47 coincides with 11 on the 4th clockface .
Barack Obama is 47 years old as he assumes the presidency .
HOWEVER , Barack Obama flubbed a line in the official oath on January 20 , 2009 , so on January 21 , 2009 , Chief Justice Roberts went to the White House and repeated the oath with Barack Obama .
This date translates as 01/21/2009 = 1+21+20+9=51 which coincides with 3 on the 5th clockface .
The number 21 also coincides with 9 on the 2nd clockface .
Yet again , 5+1=6 the number of the sacrificer , the christ / antichrist notion .
These numbers are all just nonsense if the symbolic subliminal strength is n’t taken into consideration .
The subconcious mind takes it all in and muddles around with it all , attempting to make sense out of something that ’s not meant to make any sense .
However , when certain suggestions are made regarding the luciferian manipulation and the ongoing agenda of control , the masses of humanity react , feeling quite confident and certain that this is what they should be doing .
All this is MASS HYPNOSIS THROUGH THE MANIPULATION OF LIGHT .
What ’s An Inauguration Of The HIGH PRIEST Without A HUMAN SACRIFICE
On December 27 , 2008 , the Israeli Army began attacks on Gaza to silence the Hamas rocket attacks on Israel .
The luciferian mindset , controlling both sides of the issue , directed the puppet leaders to perform this pointless HUMAN SACRIFICE RITUAL in honour of the incoming 44th HIGH PRIEST of Yeshua ( USA ) .
For 23 days ( 23 coincides with 11 = DEATH and 2+3=5 SACRIFICE ) , the Israeli ’s hammered the innocent people of Gaza , ( which coincides with the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Los Angeles ) and the Hamas leaders fired rockets at the innocent civilians of Israel .
The whole charade was complete insanity .
By the time the inauguration of the 44th High Priest was due , the shelling stopped , a cease fire was established ( sort of ) , and 1300 Palestinians and 13 Israelis were SACRIFICED TO BARACK OBAMA .
1300 or 13 coincides with 1 the New Age .
The 100:1 ratio involved in Israeli to Palestinian sacrifice victims , demonstrates the SUN GOD , the SION GOD , the GOD of the ION , the Light Bringing God ’s message to the whole world .
There are a chosen people to follow and to admonish as the people of god , and to think to do otherwise will require MASSIVE SACRIFICE .
Of course , this is the theme of the whole inauguration of the 44th HIGH PRIEST .
Everyone must sacrifice in order to make the system work .
Everyone must dig in and volunteer , and become a bleeding heart to attempt to fix and maintain something that is purposely designed to fail and destroy .
In other words , EVERYONE MUST BECOME A SLAVE to the SYSTEM .
As the 44th HIGH PRIEST preaches about an END TO SLAVERY , its really just the beginning of what the luciferian thinkers hope to be ETERNAL SLAVERY to a MINDSET perpetuating lunacy .
NUMBER 44 – SWASTIKA – RUFF – BARK – Sirius / Serious
The number 44 is the symbol of the CORNERSTONE of faith in the SION GOD .
This is 1 corner of the atom symbol , OR 1/4 of the Light Beam symbol demonstrated on this chart , with the CIRCLE and SQUARE drawn around it .
The word :
FOUR = RUOF = RUFF = BARK = BARACK = DOG = SIRIUS STAR = HAWAII = HAWAH = GOD
When you take 4 – 4 ’s and reverse one of them , and place them back to back , you obtain a square .
2 of these squares , with 1 given a 45 degree twist , forms an OCTAGON .
An octagon can also be formed by placing 4 fours in the order shown in the top left corner of the ‘ FOUR CHART ‘.
Two 4 ’s also form an ‘ HOURGLASS ’ , a symbol of control through the concept of TIME PASSING .
The open - topped number 4 , when overlapped 4 times , form a SWAZTIKA .
They also form a SQUARE , with a CROSS in the middle .
All the symbolism attached to the number 4 , is multiplied by another 4 , and another , and another .
This is how the luciferian mindset replicates in perpetuity , the 3 dimensional light show flashing all around us .
The number 4 is pronounced as FOUR , which eventually works its symbolism to express the BARK of a DOG .
This DOG represents a GOD , and is the DOG STAR called SIRIUS , which coincides with HAWAII , ( as shown on previous pages ) .
This is the birthplace of Barack Obama , ( on official forms ) , whose nickname is BARK and / or BEAR , and his name BARACK relates to the BARK of a DOG GOD , and suggests the BA sacrifice on the RK or ROCK .
The whole inauguration process began today , January 20 , 2009 , from the Blair House , where Obama travelled in his NEW CADILLAC LIMOUSINE called ‘ The BEAST ’ , down 8th STREET ( control ) to St. John ’s ( OANNES the fish god ) Episcopal Church .
This church has 6 COLUMNS ( the sacrificer ) and is painted YELLOW and WHITE , ( Holiness unto EYE - T God ) .
The swearing in ceremonies began at 12 NOON eastern time , which made it 11 AM in Cairo Illinois , right in the fork of the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers .
In Kansas , ( Kans - OZ ) , and YELLOWSTONE , ( Holystone ) , this event took place at 10 AM and in Los Angeles , San Francisco , Mount Olympus and Vancouver , at 9 AM .
What symbolically transpired with these time zone changes , was the symbolic seismic locations of Cairo , Yellowstone , and the Western States , was another 9 representing the FALL , and an 11 representing DEATH , in the fork of the rivers that symbolize the NILE .
After the church service , the 44th High Priest is off to the White House Temple to have COFFEE and TEA with the 43rd High Priest .
COFFEE = KHOFU and KHAFRE and MENKAURE , or KOFFEE , EEFFOK , or the name of the FUCK GOD .
Tea = T , the sacrifice CROSS .
All this chit chat occurred in the BLUE ROOM of the White House , or symbolically the WATER and SKY ROOM , symbolic of where NUT , the Night Goddess gathers the dead unto herself , ‘ to protect them ’ .
The Oath of Office to swear in the next High Priest is only 35 words , which coincides with 11 on the 3rd clockface , yet another 11 .
As one can see , this is not just a simple transition of power from one political leader to another , this is the highest form of symbolic SUN GOD WORSHIP disguised as some common aspect of the democratic process .
There is no such thing as a democratic process , anymore than there is a tooth fairy .
Something that must n’t be overlooked is the date of the inauguration itself .
January 20 , 2009 translates as :
01/20/2009 = 01+20+20+09 = 50 the number of sacrifice with intensity .
This is the same number 50 that appeared on the $ 50 bill , 2001 series , ( shown on page 27 ) , with the subliminal implant showing the 2 World Trade Centre Towers collapsing , that ultimately killed almost 3,000 people .

Dome Rock Mountains Arizona
The 8 sided Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem , covers the Foundation Stone which relates to the shape of the 11 Western States .
On the map just above , right at the lower left border of California and across the Colorado River in Arizona , the Dome Rock Mountains stretch for only 35 miles .
These mountains are situated just at the edge of the 8 sided Dome of the Rock octagon that fits into the angle of California , and touches on all the 11 Western States when extended to the Canadian Border and to the outside edge of Colorado .
The obvious question is , ‘ WHY ARE THESE MOUNTAINS , WHICH ARE LOCATED AT THE EDGE OF THE DOME OF THE ROCK OCTAGON , CALLED DOME ROCK MOUNTAINS ?’
On the map , RIVERSIDE COUNTY comes to the edge of the Colorado River .
Islamic tradition states that the ‘ voices of the dead can be heard with the Rivers of Paradise ’ as you listen in the Well of Souls cave .
Here again , another strange coincidence that Riverside County is adjacent to The Dome Rock Mountains .
Also , IMPERIAL COUNTY is just to the south , suggesting something ROYAL .
Again , BIG MARIA MOUNTAINS are situated in Riverside County .
Big MARIA = MARY = SEA = SEE , the Queen of Heaven .
Right in the middle of all this , are 2 sets of CHOCOLATE MOUNTAINS , with chocolate meaning the ‘ FOOD OF THE GODS ’ .
There ’s even one more Egytian Sun God worshipping mountain range in this vicinity called the KOFA MOUNTAINS .
The Great Pyramid of Giza is called KHUFU .
GIZA = AZIG = OZIY = OZ EYE
Some of these names are located in CALIFORNIA , which name , as shown on the chart below , comes from the term Caliphate , that refers to the Muslim leader , or the CALIPH .
California has the angle of ORION ’S constellation , ( 135 degrees ) .
The combination of these 2 concepts creates the word :
CALIPH -ORION = CALIF -ORNIA
The Muslim caliph who built the Dome of the Rock in 690 - 691 AD was called Caliph Abd al - Malik .
ABD AL - MALIK = BA sacrifice Death ALLAH /LA / Los Angeles MILK
The word MILK referring once again to the Great Flood of the Nile .
Some of these mountain range names are located in ARIZONA = A RISE ON = HOR EYES ON = ORION
Both ARIZONA and CALIFORNIA are inspired by the ORION CONTELLATION .
As well , and mentioned on previous pages , Oregon , at the north border of California is also based on the word Orion .
OREGON = OR -EY - ON = ORION .
With all this Islamic / Muslim symbolism just wreaking throughout the United States of America , it seems rather odd that this country has declared war on Islamic extremism , when nothing could be more extreme than creating a nation filled with massive Islamic symbology , and at the same time , ATTEMPTING TO HIDE IT !
CUBA – CUBS – CHICAGO
KAABA – KA - BALL - A – DEATH BALL
Islamic / Muslim / Jewish / Christian Egyptian Sun God worship symbolism in the New World does n’t end here however .
The Island of Cuba , if pronounced as KAW - BA , is the very same name as the KAABA Stone in the Islamic Mosque of Mecca .
Cuba is also known for its incredible baseball players , in spite of its small size .
Taking into consideration the name CUBA = KAABA the sound of this word is almost identical to KAA - BALL , which in turn is the term given to the KABBALA , or the Tree of Life .
The Kabbala is the ability to manipulate matter , one molecule at a time , and for centuries , has been referred to as MAGIC .
KAABA = KA - BALL -A = KA life / death force – BALL - A sacrifice of Allah / LA
In reality , and symbolically , Cuba derives its name from the Kabbala , the mysteries associated with the world ’s Secret Societies ( SECRET=SACRED=SEX ) reaching back to ancient BA - BY - LON .
READ THIS NEXT PARAGRAPH VERY SLOWLY AND CAREFULLY .
REREAD IT MANY TIMES .
THIS IS THE MYSTERY
What actually occurs within the Kabbala secret space , where matter can be manipulated one molecule at a time , is that the sub-atomic particles have spin .
When the particles are separated and removed to any distance from one another , ( even light years apart – distance has no effect ) , those particles that were once associated at close range will keep spinning in the same direction .
Interestingly , when the spin is changed on one separated sub atomic particle , the other separated particles will now change their spin in agreement .
This is why , in voodoo , spiritism , religious miracles , satanic rituals , black magic , corporate advertising , etc. … whatever is chosen to be manipulated , some particle relating to that chosen subject must be OBTAINED or CREATED .
Understanding that sub-atomic particles are originally created through the THOUGHT PROCESS conjured up by the luciferian egregore group of thinkers , then creating an intense focus upon a chosen subject , or a CHOSEN THOUGHT , with a like minded group , an EGREGORE , can direct and change the spin of the particles at any distance .
This is performed endlessly in politics , religion , intellectual institutions and the media .
This Kabbalism Secret is then transferred to the game of Baseball .
With the shape of the Ball Diamond to agree with one quarter of the Atom Symbol , ( as demonstrated on this site ) and with certain dimensions , rules , and symbols introduced , the game becomes a satanic ( knowledge or enlightenment ) ritual , that can change the spin of whatever is suggested , either subliminally or consciously as the game is played out .
Interestingly , the game of baseball is played for 9 INNINGS , or 9 EYES , yet again , or EYN EYES , or simply EYES , and is the number of the FALL .
Baseball can extend to extra innings in the event of a tie , and can go on indefinitely .
In relation to the luciferian agenda , the duality game of baseball , which is the 3D experience , will continue on indefinitely , keeping humanity locked in a state of emotional hysteria and thereby controlling the Paradise State .
The name CUBA refers to the CUB , the Little Bear or the Little Dipper , or Ursa Minor .
This is the KA - BA , or Killing Sacrifice .
The Little Dipper , if you recall , pours into the Big Dipper in the sky , and this relates to Alaska pouring into California .
The name has been picked up and used by the Chicago Cubs in Illinois , with their Blue and Red Circular logo , relating to the All Seeing Eye , or the Enlightenment , of the KA - BA , the CU - BA .
The Chicago Cubs are also often called The Boys in Blue noting the team ’s primary uniform color , ( which itself is often referred to as “ Cubbie Blue ” ) or simply as “ The Cubbies ” .
The franchise is infamous for its 100 - year title DROUGHT , NO WATER 1908 - 2008 the longest of any major North American professional sports teams .
This has created an intense desire to end the drought , and this can only be achieved with a lot of water .
Subconsciously , the suggestions are all in place .
Consciously , it does n’t make a stitch of sense , but from a sinister hypnotic misdirection perspective , and with the understanding of how sub-atomic particles can be manipulated by intense thought focus , it becomes so very obvious what is transpiring .
Yet again , we have the Little Dipper , the Little Bear CUB , pouring from the CHICAGO CUBS , or KIKAYO KUBS ( another KKK ) situated on Lake Michigan , ( Archangel MICHAEL ) down into the 11 midwestern states and the earthquake hotspot at Cairo Illinois also known as Little Egypt .
The CUBS logo forms the All Seeing Eye circle , and captures the colours of WATER with BLUE , and FIRE with RED .
The letters form :
C=SEA and UBS=SUB , or UNDER the SEA , or SUBMARINE , which is hidden in the words ROSE BUSH and the BUSH family and how the SEA will RISE over the USA and beyond during their place in the luciferian agenda .
This 100 year drought is achieved in the very same year that Barack Obama , from Illinois , is elected to be the High Priest of the USA .
As demonstrated previously , the name BARACK OBAMA , relates to the lightning of Muhammad ’s magic horse , al - Buraq , ( Buraq means lightning ) which in turn refers to the name of Muhammad , and the MOO / Cow / MILK symbolism relating to the Great Flood .
So , the THOUGHT association between the CUBS , the BEARS , the KAABA , CUBA , the DROUGHT , 100 years , WATER , etc. and all the symbology associated with the game of BASEBALL , BUS - BA -LL , or SUB - BA -LL , assists in generating a NEW SPIN on the sub atomic particles that were once associated with these notions , NO MATTER HOW FAR APART they may be from the location of the original thought forms .
BASEBALL = BUS - BALL = SUB marine BA sacrifice of ALLAH or LA
See the Future Map of America just above , showing the water from Lake Michigan flowing into the Mississippi River region , on down to the Gulf of Mexico coast .
Consider the flooding that has already occurred there over recent years , and the earthquakes in the area of southern Illinois and Indiana that coincided with the Pope ’s visit in 2008 .
As well , Hurricane Katrina of August , 2005 , illustrates the workings of intense thought focus and the manipulation of sub-atomic particles and the literal spin placed on this type of energy manipulation .
HURRICANE = HARRAH-KA-N = HAWAH-KA-EYE = HAYAH Hebrew for “ He Who Is ” , or I Am That I Am , from the triconsonantal root of HAWAH , which literally means to BLOW or FALL .
Yahweh means “ He who BLOWS ‘ , who makes certain things to FALL , ( a storm deity ) .
Yahweh lead the Israelites into the Land of Milk and Honey , after Yahweh , or God , appeared to Moses in the BURNING BUSH and revealed his name to him .
( See the charts and text above regarding the Burning Bush that would not be consumed ) .
From wikipedia we get this :
In the book of Job ( Iyov ) , ha -satan is the title , not the proper name , of an angel submitted to God ; he is the divine court ’s chief prosecutor .
In Judaism ha -satan does not make evil , rather points out to God the evil inclinations and actions of humankind .
In essence ha-satan has no power unless humans do evil things .
After God points out Job ’s piety , ha - satan asks for permission to test the faith of Job .
The righteous man is afflicted with loss of family , property , and later , health , but he still stays faithful to God .
At the conclusion of this book GOD APPEARS AS A WHIRLWIND , explaining to all that divine justice is inscrutable .
In the epilogue Job ’s possessions are restored and he has a second family to “ replace ” the one that died .
HA - SATAN = HA -SHAITAN in Arabic = KNOWLEDGE or the ENLIGHTENMENT = LIGHT = EYE of GOD
God appears as the WHIRLWIND , or the HURRICANE , or the HARAKAN , or ARAKAN , or ARK - AN , or RAK EYE , ROCKY
Yet again , ARAKAN = ARKANSAS and LITTLE ROCK being the capital
ARAKAN = ARCANE = OLD ANCIENT OF DAYS , or DAZE
Abraham married SARAH and at 90 years of age ( 90 the Fall ) , Abraham ’s son Ishmael was born to HAGAR the handmaiden of Sarah .
This symbolism is repeated with the nonsense surrounding the Sarah Palin rhetoric eminating from the al - AQSA Mosque of ALASKA .
Sarah Palin being a symbol of JUNO , the Greek mother goddess who brings children to the light .
The name SARAH = HARAHS = the HURRICANE , or STORM DEITY once again .
Its all the same bull shit repeated over and over again , without the slightest trace of logic whatsoever .
Just remember , its not supposed to be logical , its just supposed to suggest , and in suggesting , the sub-atomic particles , all of this illusory reality , changes its spin .
Yet again , SARAH , who was barren , all of a sudden is not barren at the age of 90 ( another FALL ) , and ISAAC is born to her .
ISAAC = ISAAK = EYES KA = EYE of KA life / death force
Cuba – Magic Cube of the Cubbala
With the election of Barack Obama , one of the first High Priest orders to come down from the White House Temple was the CLOSING of GUANTANAMO BAY , the US Naval Station Detention Camp in CUBA .
There are 250 prisoners left to either be freed , relocated or convicted and imprisoned within the next year .
Guantanamo Bay is also referred to as GITMO , a type of acronym .
Guantanamo Bay is another G and B name .
Therefore it represents a Pillar associated with Solomon ’s Temple .
This means that it will be used as a symbol of deception as every pillar established within the luciferian agenda is used to manipulate and deceive .
In this case , the very elite , presidents , prime ministers , generals , lord ’s , and high ranking world manipulators , the very ones who created this torture chamber in the first place , are now calling for its dismantling .
This dismantling is now of the utmost importance , and must be performed within the next year .
The Judgment of GITMO BEGINS
GITMO = EYE Sacrifice Cross Mother
The obvious question is “ WHY ” ?
Why was there such a rush to get it in place in 2001 , with bounties in the millions of dollars placed on the heads of suspects in Afghanistan , and now WHY , is there such a rush to close it , and relocate , or convict , or set free , the prisoners by early 2010 ?
The answer is that the 2010 Winter Olympics occur begin on February 12 , 2010 , and the suggestions are now being firmly put into place that will cause whatever hardship and turmoil the luciferian agenda hopes to bring to pass by the beginning of the Olympics .
Already , the cost overruns are immense as the Olympic site is being built .
The creditors have pulled out of financing the Olympic Village , all of which has coincided with Barack Obama being elected as High Priest .
The city of Vancouver is on the hook for paying for hundreds of millions of dollars worth of lost credit .
The symbolism of setting the PRISONERS FREE , CONVICTING THEM , or RELOCATING THEM , carries with it the notion of a coming JUDGMENT PERIOD .
This is the Judgment of ALLAH being taken to the next level , and the next few years will show that the Financial Crisis , the Energy Crisis , and every other fabricated Crisis , is a simple manipulation tool to show how utterly deserving humanity is of JUDGMENT , and we best fall in line and obey .
Of course , it wo n’t be quite that blatant , but in actual fact , that ’s how it ’ll play out .
According to the luciferian agenda , the PRISONERS will be JUDGED by Fire and Water , which refer to SEISMIC and FLOOD activity .
Therefore , within the next year , there will be an increase in the natural disasters around the world , as well as increased natural disaster events in the western parts of North America , and in particular , the 11 Western States , and continued devastation in the 11 Midwest States .
Another related story is that of Fidel Castro .
After a long illness , and transfer of power to his brother Raoul , Fidel Castro has stated that he does n’t expect to be alive in 4 years .
Again , we have to ask , WHY , and WHAT is going to occur in 4 years ?
The suggestions are there , the subliminals implanted , and our illusory reality will take shape .
Keep in mind , CUBA is the KAABA , the Kabbala , the Tree of Life , or more accurately , the Tree of Lies .
CUBA – KAABA STONE – The Devils Triangle
On the chart just above , the Bermuda Triangle , also called the Devils Triangle , or Isle of Devil ’s , is shown with lines drawn in , that illustrate the area of very curious activities over the last decades and even centuries .
Ships , airplanes and people have been known to just ‘ DISAPPEAR ‘ for no logical reason whatsoever .
Depending on the researchers involved in attempting to decipher what ’s behind these activities , the boundaries of the triangle will vary according to the information they have personally gathered .
There is a general shape that emerges , however , as to the area that includes the Devil ’s Triangle .
This area coincides quite readily with the FISH SHAPE of MECCA , the Islamic Mosque in Saudi Arabia , where the Islamic people innocently perform their HAJJ ritual by circumambulating around the KAABA / CUBA STONE 7 times .
When this FISH SHAPED MOSQUE is laid over the Bermuda / Devil ’s Triangle , with the KAABA / CUBA Stone coinciding , one above the other , and the FISH MOSQUE is stretched to the western limits of the Bermuda Triangle , the FISHES TAIL reaches the edge of Mexico in the Gulf of Mexico .
Mexico is yet another suggestion relating to Megiddo , the site of the Battle of Armageddon as shown on previous pages .
The JUDGMENT of ALLAH Now In Progress
A breakdown of some of these names reveals yet again , the subliminals implanted by these names and geographical locations .
All revealing the luciferian THOUGHT PROCESS and manipulation of sub-atomic particles through religious and intellectually inspired rituals .
This illustrates the subliminal hypnotic misdirection of our reality and how events , both natural and manmade , are used in tandem , resulting in bringing our illusory reality into existence .
The effects from the luciferian religious and intellectual rituals are directed to the EASTERN and / or to the WESTERN Hemispheres as indicated by the names and geographical coordinates .
This is the Judgment of Allah in the progress , being directed from the ROCK , which is the KAABA , the KABBALA and CUBA even as Yellowstone / HOLYSTONE is the Judgment ROCK of the 11 Western States .
The DUALITY NATURE of the luciferian mindset includes 2 hemispheres , east and west , upon which to pronounce Divine Judgment .
There are 2 POLES , or 2 PILLARS of CLEANSING , north and south .
There are 2 ROCKS of JUDGMENT , one relating to Jerusalem and directed at the SEISMIC riddled 11 Western States .
The other Judgment ROCK relates to Mecca and the Kaaba Stone and directed at the FLOOD prone 11 Midwest States as judgment from the SEA comes from CUBA , or the KAABA .
Both judgment ROCKS have Seismic regions , however the 11 Western States is larger .
The 11 Midwest States include the area adjacent to Cairo Illinois and the seismic activity of this region , but the area is prone to hurricanes and flooding , greater than usually experienced in the 11 Western States .
The duality nature of the luciferian agenda , also includes a DOUBLE CROSS , the Octagon symbol of total control .
Duality is used to establish confusion and to create a smokescreen and veil of deceit .
Judgment is carried out by the ROCK , the MATTER of the Mother , which is the SEA and the SEIS - MIC activity of these regions .
These are the 2 SEES , the SEIS and SEAS , that lend their meaning to the name IS - IS , or the 2 EYES , and is suggesting the 2 POLAR ICE CAPS that are melting as part of the cleansing process .
This will ultimately be directed at the ROCK of the 11 Western States , even as it is NOW DIRECTED at the 11 Midwest States .
BERMUDA = BEAR - Mother - Death of Allah – the Triangle area centred from 75 degrees to approx .
100 degrees West .
BERMUDA = BURMA -MyanMAR
Death of Allah = BEAR My Mother Sea – Site of the 2008 Myanmar / Burma Cyclone – centred from 75 degrees to approx .
100 degrees East .
MYANMAR = MAYAN SEA = MAYAN PYRAMIDS of the YUCATAN PENINSULA and Eastern Mexico
MEXICO = MEHEKO = MEYE -KO = MY Kill
MEGIDDO = MEYEDO = MEYE -DO = MY Death
Just as the 11 Western States have a symbol of ALLAH in the city of LA , or Los Angeles , the 11 Midwest States have a symbol nearby as well , and is the state of ALABAMA .
ALABAMA = ALLAH BAM A or the Thunder of Allah , the storm god THOR , or YAHWEH , which will be directed at LA .
On the east side of Alabama is the state of GEORGIA the location of the GEORGIA GUIDESTONES with instructions on how to restart a New World in the event of a global cataclysm .
GEORGIA = EYE ROSE EYE = I ROSE I or the Sea of Allah that will rise , again referring to LA .
On the west side of Alabama is the state of MISSISSIPPI , with the symbolism of ISIS , the Queen of Heaven , included with the name .
These 3 states were some of those in which slavery was widespread and which ultimately led to the Civil War and the Lincoln era .
Now we see the same symbolism brought to the fore , with the election of Barack Obama , and the symbolic connections to Lincoln .
Just as the 11 Western States are connected to the state of Alaska , the Little Dipper , the 11 Midwest States have ILLINOIS and the symbolism of CHICAGO and the CUBS , the Land of Lincoln , being the Little Dipper that will pour out into the 11 Midwest States .
Just to the northwest of Illinois is the state of Minnesota , the NORTH STAR state , which is again symbolic of the Little Dipper pouring into the BIG DIPPER , which is symbolized by the state of OKLAHOMA with its PANHANDLE shape and a DIPPER CUP .
The northern border of OKLAHOMA is right at 37 degrees north , and coincides with the 4 Corners Cross states and San Francisco .
Oklahoma is the site of the Oklahoma Bombing which was a human sacrifice ritual conducted in exactly the same fashion as the World Trade Centre attack , with the exact same elite players involved , right down to the clean up crew used to carry the debris away .
All of this is now directing the focus and energy , and directing the SPIN of the SUB - ATOMIC particles of the KABBALA principle , in precisely the same fashion as the HAJJ rituals of Mecca , and aimed towards the ultimate judgment on the ROCK of the 11 Western States .
The Devil Fish of MECCA
When stretched out to the eastern edge of the Bermuda Triangle where those studying this phenomena have general agreement , the FISHES NOSE coincides with the southern border of the triangle where the border makes a sharp turn and begins to extend in a northeastern direction heading toward the mid Atlantic Ridge fault line .
Interestingly , the underside of the FISH SHAPE near the TAIL , coincides with the YUCATAN PENINSULA .
Furthermore , the areas of Mexico , Texas and Florida , where the fishes body generally covers , much of this area is extremely low lying and easily covered in flood situations .
Hurricane Katrina – The Eye Of CUBE Of KAABA
Below is a photograph of Hurricane Katrina which led to the human sacrifice of almost 3,000 people in New Orleans .
This occurred over the Island of Cuba , originating in the Bahamas , in the Devil ’s Triangle .
BAHAMAS = BA sacrifice – HAMAS hammer = Thors Hammer , or the sacrifice cross
This name also relates to the Palestinian leadership in GAZA , calledHAMAS , which just went through a human sacrifice ritual of 1300 Palestinians and 13 Israelis .
A 100:1 ratio .
This sacrifice , is directed at Los Angeles as demonstrated on a previous chart showing Israel and the area of GAZA coinciding with the area off the coast of Los Angeles .
As these hurricanes form in the Caribbean , but not always in the BAHAMAS , they always devastate the southern states to varying degrees .
The hurricanes and tornados of these southern states and 11 Midwest States are a direct result of the STORM DEITY , the BLOW and FALL god called YAHWEH , again called ALLAH , and pronounced more symbolically as LA .
RING AROUND THE ROSEY
POCKET FULL OF POSERS
Applying the principles of the Kabbala to the Hajj ritual in Mecca shows the result of such Satanic ritualism .
The circumambulation around the Mecca KAABA results in natural disasters such as Katrina , and not necessarily at the same time , or even the same year .
There ’s no such thing as TIME and SPACE , and as the rituals are performed , its like 2 geared wheels driving one another , one is smaller and one is larger , and it takes more illusory time for a large wheel to complete one revolution than it does for the smaller wheel with the same size gears .
In precisely this manner , the rituals of the Kabbala and the SPIN placed upon the SUB - ATOMIC paricles , or the THOUGHT FORMS relating to the ritual , determines the end result at the desired moment .
In this instance , Hurricane Katrina demonstrates how these storms are manufactured and directed at the desired time with the desired result .
The time and location are determined by the subliminals attached to the ritual and to co-relationships outside the ritual boundaries that support the intent of the ritual .
Such as those expressed through the media in all its forms .
All tornados and hurricanes are a direct result of the Storm Deity meting out judgment .
In this moment in the luciferian agenda , the judgment is severe , and aiming for an ultimate CLIMAX in the Marriage Supper of the Lamb .
CLIMAX = MILK AX = CREAM of SEX
With a simple observation of the Seismic region of the 11 Western States , the same circular motion , that of a Golden Mean is manufactured and ready and waiting for the unloading of Yellowstone / HOLYSTONE , and the Seat of Mount Olympus in SEATTLE Washington .
HOLY SEA of BARACK OBAMA
When the maps of the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico are compared to that of Saudi Arabia and the Arabian Sea , the hidden subliminals in the names become obvious .
The CARIBBEAN is the ARABIAN Sea .
MECCA is MEXICO .
The QUBA MOSQUE in Medina , is the 1st and oldest mosque of Islam , and is CUBA , in exactly the same way as the KAABA STONE is also a subliminal for CUBA .
The CARIBBEAN is also BIRAC - ION in reverse , which translates to BARAC EYE ON , or BARACK SEE , the Sacrifice ROCK SEA .
The city of Medina , the 2nd Holiest site to Islam , is in the MIDDLE , or the MEDIAN , between the 2 ROCKS of SACRIFICE in Mecca and Jerusalem .
The name MEDINA = MEDIAN = MEDIA .
The MEDIA spreads the laws of ALLAH , delivering his message through his messenger PROPHET / PROFIT Muhammad .
That particular message being the subliminal hypnotic message of the coming flood .
The hypnosis process , which is the thinking process , has conjured up illusory events and illusory geographical locations , with illusory names and terms that relate to different aspects of the illusion , even though they appear to be separated by TIME and SPACE .
Through the unseen connection of sub-atomic particles , this illusory reality can be manipulated at will , endlessly , without the slightest hint of detection .
For this reason , the original thought process is replicated throughout the world in countless ways , but all with just a subtle twist to hide the intent and manipulation tactics .
The locations of MECCA ( 1st Holiest to Islam ) , MEDINA ( 2nd Holiest ) , and JERUSALEM ( 3rd Holiest ) , are three such names that have hidden suggestions .
MECCA sometimes spelled MAKKAW , has a double C , or double K , suggesting the plural sound of the letter X . With a bit of substitution , MECCA = MEX - A = MEX - CO = MEXICO .
This also suggests MESA , as in MESOPOTAMIA , and MESOAMERICA , the region of Saudi Arabia and the area of the southwest USA .
One other name is the QUBA MOSQUE , just outside of Medina .
This is the OLDEST MOSQUE in Islam , and its said that Muhammad assisted in laying the foundation stones .
QUBA is the 4th Holiest site in Islam .
Another subliminal linking ISLAM , the ICE LAMB , to the 4th Holiest site with the 44th President .
On the map of the Caribbean just below , the country of CUBA is situated in the middle of the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico .
The QUBA MOSQUE is again referring to CUBA in the Caribbean .
The name CARIBBEAN really translates as ARABIAN C , and as the BIRAC - ION , or BARACK SEE , the Holy See of BARACK , as mentioned above .
However , the BAHAMAS ISLANDS are also located in the area of the DEVIL ’S TRIANGLE and the site of Christopher Columbus ’ discovery of AMERICA .
The name BAHAMAS is also referring to Barack Obama in a subliminal sense .
BAHAMAS ISLANDS = BA - HAMAS ISLE = BAMAS EYE = BAMAS - O = O - BAMAS = OBAMA
What this demonstrates is that the luciferian subliminal suggestion is not limited by TIME or SPACE .
Size does not matter in this instance , has far as being able to conjure forth any illusory form , be it a SEA , a group of ISLANDS , a CONTINENT , nothing is impossible to conjure up .
After all , its just suggestion , and this suggestion just supports and builds upon other suggestions , and the sub-atomic particles of all this suggestion takes off in a mad self - replicating orgy throughout the universe .
The notion of a Barack Obama , and an ARABIAN BAHAMAS SEE as 44th High Priest President has been in the agenda for throughout these illusory millenia .
Of course , because this is all sinister hypnotic misdirection of reality , none of the elite players really know who and why they do what they do .
The trance state has been indoctrinated into each illusory individual person through religion and intellectualism , totally disarming these elite puppets to do the bidding of the thinking egregore .
SPIRITUAL RUNNING of ISLAM – MARATHONS and SPORTS
The circumambulation of the Kaaba Blackstone in Mecca , which is also part of the worship of CHRISLAM in Nigeria , is referred to as ‘ SPIRITUAL RUNNING ’.
Chrislam is a combination of Christianity and Islam , and this ‘ RUNNING DELIVERANCE ’ is looked upon as God ’s LOVE .
With this concept in mind consider , the MARATHONS of the world , based on the Marathon of ancient Greece and the Marathon events of the Olympics , and the indoctrination through physical exercise in the intellectual institutions of the world , and yet again , we see that SPORTS are part of the religious ritual associated with belief in god and attempting to maintain the physical 3D body as if it were a sacred form and that it were real .
SPORTS = S - POUR -T-S = Isis Goddess Pours Sacrifice Cross = ritual flogging associated with hero worship
OOH EE OOH AH AH PING PANG AL LAH BALLA BING BANG
This last heading does n’t make a bit of sense .
Of course , neither does this next phrase , unless its subliminally connected to some desired outcome .
Everytime the Islamic faithful refer to Muhammad in their speech , or say his name , they must repeat the phrase :
SALLA ALLAHU ALAYHI WA SALLAM
What this literally means in English is ‘ Peace Be Upon Him ’ .
The most glaring thing in this phrase is the extreme usage of the AL or LA sounds .
Consider then , the whole Arabic language with its endless usage of the prefix al , or Al , or El , which all refer to ALLAH , but subliminally all refer to LA or Los Angeles .
Now multiply this repetitious use of the sound LA or AL , by the largest religion in the world , Islam ( some 1.5 billion faithful ) , who repeat this phrase endlessly whenever they refer to Muhammad or speak his name , and multiply that again by many centuries , and guess what ?
You have the largest satanic ( Shaitanic enlightenment ritual , or knowledge ritual ) the world has ever produced .
A KNOWLEDGE RITUAL , is a THOUGHT RITUAL , and THOUGHTS are SUB - ATOMIC particles that transfer the thought content in whatever direction and to whatever destination is desired .
However , combine that with all the El or Al , of the Catholic based Spanish language , or the le or la of the Catholic based French language , as well as the OF or THE which has the same subliminal root sound of the Christian English speaking world and this now includes another 1 billion or more of the world population all using the same satanic ritual incantation that relates to the judgment of LA , or the judgment of ALLAH .
This sound refers to ALLAH , or JEHOVAH , or YAHWEH , and is simply suggesting A - WAY , or the destruction of the masses as a whole .
Or as that wonderful little subliminal that the illusory Jesus mentioned , that in the day of the Lord ’s Vengeance , god will say something to the effect of AWAY WITH THE SINNERS .
Depart from me , for I knew you not .
The worship of Allah , Jehovah , Yahweh , or any number of gods with the same subliminal sound , is not referring to redemption , it only suggests condemnation , or THE WAY , or AWAY with you .
On the map of Saudi Arabia just below , the locations of Mecca , Medina and Jerusalem are shown , along with the location of the ARABIAN SEA .
Once again , this is the very same name as the C - ARIBBEAN SEA , with a couple of extra letters thrown in to hide the intent , but not the subliminal sub-atomic particle thought manipulation .
Notice the order of these locations as well , Mecca , the southernmost , Medina in the Middle and Jerusalem to the north .
Notice also , the many angled corners within the borders of Saudi Arabia , many of which are true octagons , and many are distorted octagons , or relate to other sacred geometric angles .
Keep in mind that the Arabic world gave the English speaking world our Arabic number system and the sacred geometry used throughout the world to literally attempt to build the kingdom of god on earth .
This part of the Middle East , or Mesopotamia , includes portions of the land of ancient Canaan , the land that Moses journeyed through on his way to the promised land .
Canaan includes modern day Jordan , which also includes the angled borders .
This ancient land now relates to CANADA , the new CANAAN in a subliminal sense , ( as mentioned on previous pages ) , and CANADA is filled with 8 OCTAGON BORDERS , along with 1 OCTAGON BORDER in California , which has produced yet another subliminal symbolic connection to the Arab World and the hypnotic trance inducement relating to Egyptian / Babylonian sungod worship .
MECCA MEDINA JERUSALEM USA
Following the order of the locations of Mecca , Medina and Jerusalem , from north to south , and comparing these locations to the west coast of North America , some very interesting comparisons are drawn .
Mecca California , is a small census district with an incredibly symbolic geographical location .
Mecca coincides with the location of the WELL of SOULS as demonstrated on the Foundation Rock charts , and which is located under the Dome of the ROCK in Jerusalem .
Mecca California is located just north of the SULTAN SEA , which is 220 feet below sea level and is suspected to be the source of the BIG ONE earthquake , according to seismologist data .
Mecca is located on Highway Route 111 .
Medina Washington , is a city named after Medina Saudi Arabia , and is the home of Bill Gates , founder of MICROSOFT and WINDOWS .
As you consider these charts , keep in mind that the Arabic world developed and worship SACRED GEOMETRY , as do FREEMASONS and all SUN GOD WORSHIPPERS .
There is no man-made invention in this 3D experience that exemplifies SACRED GEOMETRY more than the COMPUTER and the simple MATHEMATICAL PRINCIPLES of GATES and PLATFORMS that it operates on .
The COMPUTER is SACRED GEOMETRY .
The COMPUTER AGE is the AGE of AQUARIUS and the age of cleansing the world by manipulating our ORIGINAL WISDOM STATE into believing the 3 dimensional experience is real and worth maintaining .
Medina is located in KING COUNTY along with Redmond Washington , the home of MICROSOFT .
Also located in KING COUNTY is the city of Seattle , or the SEAT of EL , the EMERALD CITY of OZ .
Medina Washington relates to the 2nd most holy site in Islam , the city of Medina Saudi Arabia and the burial site of Muhammad .
The third location is Jerusalem , the City of Peace , and is the State of Alaska .
The CITY of PEACE = the SITE / SIGHT / SEE / SEA of PEACE , and Alaska is literally located in the SEA of PEACE , or PEACEFUL SEA , the PACIFIC OCEAN as it stretches more than a thousand miles out into the ocean .
ALASKA – AL - AQSA – LITTLE DIPPER – POURS and POORS
The chart below shows a close up look at Jerusalem , Alaska , symbolically the Al - Aqsa Mosque located on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem .
This is the Little Dipper State as demonstrated on previous pages .
Just how close to the Little Dipper this state is can be seen with the STARS of the Little Dipper placed over the Panhandle of Alaska , and the coinciding locations of Ketchikan , Juneau , Mount Saint Elias , Anchorage , Mt. McKinley , the Yukon - Koyukuk / Iditarod census area , and the Kuskokwim Mountains / Bethel / Red Devil region .
The Little Dipper STARS were drawn exactly from a photograph of the Little Dipper .
There was no manipulation or distortion involved , and the stars line up exactly with the cities and mountains of Alaska .
What ’s particularly interesting is that Mount Saint Elias , which refers to Elijah , a symbolic type of MESSIAH , and Mount McKinley , coincide exactly with 2 STARS on the Little Dipper as shown .
Neither of these , the STARS or the MOUNTAINS , were MANMADE !
The tallest mountain in North America is Mount McKinley at 20,320 feet , and the 2nd tallest mountain in North America is Mount Elias at 18,009 feet , and both of them coincide with 2 stars on the Little Dipper .
Mount Saint Elias also coincides EXACTLY with the 141 degree West border of Alaska , which points exactly towards MECCA at 39 degrees East .
Mount Saint Elias is exactly 60 degrees North , which coincides with 12 on the 5th clockface , and symbolizes the FULLNESS OF TIME , and the SACRIFICE of HUMANITY .
Look very closely at this chart and as the stars of the Little Dipper are placed under the cities of the Panhandle , they line up perfectly with the city of Ketchikan , which is the Polaris Star , or North Star .
The next star lines up precisely with Juneau , which is named after the Roman goddess Juno , the one who brings children to the LIGHT .
She was the goddess of childbirth and marriage .
The next star coincides with Mount Saint Elias .
The next star coincides with Anchorage , the ANCK CROSS , and is an Egyptian Hieroglyph symbol meaning ‘ LIFE ’ .
Anchorage is named after an Egyptian hieroglyph .
This cross is also called CRUX ANSATA , which is Latin for CROSS - WITH -A -HANDLE , or in this case , PANHANDLE .
PANHANDLE = PAN or SCAN A CROSS ALL – HANDLE = A CROSS HANDLE
This symbol is also known as the KEY OF LIFE , which is the TREE OF LIFE , or the KABBALA , and represents life / immortality and death .
Directly north of Anchorage is Mount McKinley , the highest peak in North America .
This peak coincides exactly with another Little Dipper Star .
To the west of Mount McKinley , the census area of YUKON - KOYUKUK and the abandoned gold mining town of IDITAROD and the community of HOLY CROSS locations coincide with yet another Little Dipper Star .
The name KOYUKUK is another of those symbolic names that refers to the KKK , or 3 Pyramids of Giza , or the EYE of OZ , in Egypt , that symbolizes life and death .
The IDITAROD TRAIL is the site of the Iditarod Dog Sled Race held annually , stretching from Anchorage to Nome Alaska , at the mouth of the Bering Strait .
The words :
DOG SLED RACE = GOD SLAYED ROCK .
LITTLE DIPPER = TTIL EL DIPP RE or RA or WA = Till El Dip Water
IDITAROD = EYE TID A ROD = High Tide A Rose Death
This is the race that Sarah Palin ’s husband TODD , has participated in .
The ceremonial start of this race is in ANCHORAGE , but the official start to the race was moved in 2008 , from Wasilla , just north of Anchorage , to WILLOW , just a bit farther north , so as to ensure enough snow for the start of the race .
Willow is located at 61 degrees N/ 150 degrees W. The number 61 coincides with 1 , a New Age , and 150 coincides with 6 , on the 13th clockface .
150 = 15 the deity number .
13 symbolizes 1 as well , and a New Age , and 6 is symbolic of the Sacrificer , the christ / antichrist , or CROSS inverted .
The site of Iditarod was established by John Beaton ( J and B name ) on Christmas Day in 1908 , with the discovery of GOLD .
The Iditarod Trail used for the Dog Sled Race is 1,161 miles long from Anchorage , however from the official race start location of Willow , the Northern Route is 1,112 miles , which of course , is slightly flexible over such a great distance .
The obvious symbolic number is 1,111 miles .
The Northern Route is run on EVEN NUMBERED YEARS , and next year , 2010 , the year of the Olympics in Vancouver / Whistler , Mount Olympus , Washington , will be on the Northern Route of 1,112 miles .
The Southern Route is 1,131 miles , and both routes share the first 444 miles before breaking off into different directions .
The number 444 of course , is symbolic with the 4 square foundation that the entire luciferian agenda is built upon .
Both the North and South routes also share a common 441 miles for the last leg of the race .
Once again , another repetitious use of the number 4 .
Symbolism is everything to the luciferian thinkers .
The official distance is set at 1,049 miles for symbolic reasons relating to Alaska being the 49th state .
1049= 10 or INTENSITY and 49 = 7×7 , or PERFECTION and COMPLETION .
49 coincides with 1 on the 5th clockface .
Symbolizing a New Age and the Sacrifice .
4+9=13 coinciding with 1 again , and 1+3=4 , the 4 Square GOD / DOG number .
FOUR = ROUF = RUFF = BARK = DOG = GOD = LIGHT = LIFE / DEATH CROSS sacrifice and 3 D hypnotic trance
The ceremonial beginning to the Iditarod Race takes place on 4th Avenue in Anchorage , the site of the huge earthquake on GOOD FRIDAY in 1964 .
The race first ran in 1973 , the same year the World Trade Centre opened in New York .
The last star of the Little Dipper coincides with the KUSKOKWIM Mountains , and the TAYLOR Mountains .
With neighbouring communities of Bethel and Red Devil .
Another KKK reference to the Pyramids of Giza , and TAYLOR is an anagram for ROYAL T or ROYAL CROSS .
All of the Little Dipper Stars coincide with locations that are named with the Pyramids of Giza – Khufu , Khafre , and MenKaure – in mind :
Ketchikan = KetKiKan , KoyuKuK , KusKoKwim
Or the Roman goddess Juno = Juneau
Or the Cross – Taylor and Anchorage
Or the Messiah – Mount Saint Elias and Mount McKinley = McKINLEY = Son of Killing NILE = Son of the Great Flood In The Sky
Medina – Medium – Media – MESSENGER MUHAMMAD
Recognizing that the whole 3D illusion is simply a mass hypnotic trance , with no basis whatsoever in reality , consider the city of Medina Saudi Arabia .
As mentioned , Medina is the location of the burial site of Muhammad in a mosque called Al - Masjid Al - Nabawi .
Notice the use of the AL letters once again , referring to Allah , or Los Angeles .
Also , the use of the WB in Nabawi .
NABAWI = I - WA - BA - N = Eye Water Sacrifice and relates to the Wanabozho RABBIT / WABBIT god mentioned on the previous page .
Muhammad was the MESSENGER of GOD , or the MEDIUM , the go - between GOD and the common man .
Muhammad was the MEDIA for the Islamic faith .
Muhammad received the laws and the 5 daily prayers , and relayed these to the people .
This is precisely the task and position of the MEDIA in todays world .
The media delivers the laws from the luciferian egregore thinkers , that in turn establish the illusory reality we experience .
Some of these laws and 5 DEITY PREYERS are shown on this site .
The 5 Daily Prayers delivered to Muhammad suggest the Sacrifice of the Deity Preying upon our Paradise State .
Medina , in Washington State , is the home of Bill Gates , and the home of MICROSOFT in REDMOND Washington , right next door to Medina .
The invention of the computer , and the introduction of WINDOWS facilitated the most widespread , interactive MEDIA FORM the world has ever witnessed .
The INTERNET !
This is the MESSENGER PROFIT of the luciferian god .
And its buried symbolically , in MEDINA WASHINGTON .
As mentioned , the use of WINDOWS , PORTALS , GATES , etc. suggests , the 2 faced god Janus , who was the god of Doors , Hallways , Corridors , and Gates , etc .
Of course , this does n’t make any kind of rational sense , however , we ’re not dealing with anything rational in the whole 3D whirlwind .
A few other computer terms that suggest something of luciferian inspiration are :
RAM = MAR Sea or Sacrifice
BYTES = To Eat , Supper , Dine , Marriage Supper
CASCADING STYLE SHEETS =
Web design format = Cascadia Ridge Subduction Zone = Cascadia Range
BITS = 8 Bits equal 1 BYTE = CONTROL
USB = BUSh = SUB
MOTHERBOARD = Mother Sacrifice Death
DAEMON = DEMON alternate spelling – computer program that runs in the background – UNSEEN – MYSTERY – SECRET / SACRED
DAEMON – ancient Greek myth – ‘ a personal demon ’ equivalent to a modern day ‘ guardian angel ’
DAEMON – BSD DAEMON – ‘ cute devil mascot ’ called BEASTIE
COOKIES = KOOKIES = Kill Flood = DOUBLE letter OO = EAU = WATER or FLOOD .
ICQ = I Seek You
JAVA = JEHOVAH = KOFFEE = FUCK = GOD
JOB = J and B word – Twin Columns or Pillars or Towers
APPLE MAC
LOTUS Software = founder Mitch Kapor – Teacher of TRANSCENDENTAL MEDITATION – Lotus Position
ORACLE – a relational database management system
PENTIUM – number 5 – sacrifice – PENT
YAHOO – ‘ Yet Another Hierarchical Officious Oracle ’
The COMPUTER , with all its accompanying symbolic terms is MUHAMMAD the MESSENGER , delivering the SACRED GEOMETRY that assists in conjuring up and maintains the 3 dimensional illusion .
The MESSENGER is the MEDIUM , the MEDIA , the one that connects us to the luciferian THOUGHT PROCESS , and convinces us that its real .
Remember , its not good or bad , just a major manipulation tool in perpetuating the 3D light show .
Mecca California – ALLAH ’S Well of Souls
MECCA CALIPH -ORIAN – MECCA CALIFORNIA
When all the names of these Middle East places are considered one after the other , in the context of this page , it becomes blatantly obvious that the creators of the New World had the Arab World , and Islam , Muhammad and Allah in mind the whole time .
North America is the sacrifice judgment ROCK of ALLAH .
The Foundation Stone that symbolizes the 11 Western States , and the Mecca Mosque with its KAABA , based on the KABBALA and the QUBA Mosque of CUBA , all relate to , and are tools of the luciferian mind control agenda .
This mind control then becomes equated to control of our Paradise State as we ’re manipulated into a mindset of confusion .
The census district of MECCA California is very small and insignificant from a size and population perspective .
From a symbolic perspective , it holds a very important place in the luciferian agenda .
This area coincides with the HOLE on the Foundation Stone , known as the Well of Souls .
Islamic tradition states that the ‘ Souls of the dead can be heard with the RIVERS of Paradise ’ as one listens from within the Cave beneath the hole .
The location of MECCA is in RIVERSIDE COUNTY .
Just slightly north of the Sultan Sea which is about 220 feet below sea level .
Also within Riverside County is the JOSHUA TREE NATIONAL PARK .
Joshua is another name for YESHUA , or JESUS , who is ZEUS , and yet again , is the YUSA , or USA .
YESHUA = YUSA = USA
Joshua fought the Battle of Jericho in the old city of Jericho , and after 7 days of circling the city , the WALLS CAME TUMBLING DOWN .
As stated earlier on this page , the circumambulation of the KAABA STONE in MECCA during the Hajj , is based on this activity of Joshua bringing down the walls of Jericho through this satanic ritual of manipulating sub-atomic particles , which is to manipulate THOUGHT FORMS .
This is the secret of the Kabbala and the mystery of the ages .
The Joshua Tree Natl .
Park is yet another shrine to the god Allah , or Jehovah , or the luciferian thinkers .
Another name in this area is TWENTY NINE PALMS .
The Palm tree is worshipped by the Egyptian sun god mindset , as are many trees .
With the name TWENTY NINE PALMS , the symbolism is 29 coinciding with 5 on the 3rd clockface .
The number 5 = SACRIFICE and 2+9=11 , symbolizing DEATH .
Another name in this location is PALM SPRINGS , signifying something coming from beneath , or springing forth .
This delivers the same subliminal as the SPRINGFIELD cities splattered throughout the USA .
The name Joshua tree was given by a group of Mormon settlers who crossed the Mojave Desert in the mid-19th century .
The tree ’s unique shape reminded them of a Biblical story in which Joshua reaches his hands up to the sky in prayer .
As a reminder , the charts from page 19 are placed immediately below that show where the Well of Souls in relation to the location of Mecca California and where the Joshua Tree National Park are located .
There are endless symbolic locations in this area , some of which will be touched upon .
SWALLOWS of Capistrano Los Angeles
The Southern Pole – The Antarctic Flood – Well of Souls
Considering that the Well of Souls represents the area around Los Angeles and Riverside and Imperial Counties , here ’s another bit of symbolism that once again , tells the same story , in a subliminal fashion , of devastation coming to this area in the form of a massive cataclysm .
Keep in mind , that if everything is done in this sort of subliminal , hypnotic suggestive fashion , then that exposes the devastation , and the luciferian agenda as being simply that , JUST SUGGESTION .
None of this is real , neither does it truly affect our Paradise State , other than when we buy into it , and believe that it is real .
The affect does n’t change our wisdom , or eternal state , but it surely keeps us distracted and controlled and unable to experience the power and freedom of that eternal state RIGHT NOW .
For all that ’s shown on this site , and shown on the internet throughout the world , NONE OF THIS IS REAL .
There ’s really nothing wrong or falling apart IN REALITY , we ’re not going to hell in a hand basket , because that too , is just a part of the myth .
The Well of Souls , shown on the chart above , shows the big hole coinciding with the area in southern California .
Already , the Joshua Tree National Park , with its symbolism has been pointed out .
The Census Area of Mecca , the Sultan Sea , and now , one more oddity is the Roman Catholic Mission of San Juan del Capistrano .
In symbolic terms this would read as :
SAINT OANNES ( the fish god of Babylon ) DEL ( death of EL , AL , or LA )
CAPISTRANO = KA - Pi-Saint - RAIN /REIGN
Over = Life / Death force – Pi diameter formula of Circle – St. Rain / Reign / Rule Over Us .
The Mission Capistrano lies on south edge of Los Angeles .
It is the oldest building in regular use in California .
It was built in 1776 USA birth year – 888 and was formally opened on NOVEMBER 1 , 1776 , All Saints Day .
( 11/01/1776 or 888 when divided by 2 ) .
On December 12 , 1812 , a 7.5 earthquake struck the San Andreas Fault in the area of Joshua Tree Park , many miles from the Mission .
However , the Mission received damage resulting in 40 parishioners being killed .
The number 40 is symbolic of 4 square once again , the foundation of the luciferian agenda .
MISSION = MI - SSION = MY ZION
DECEMBER 12 , 1812 = 12/12/12 – the number symbolic of the FULLNESS of TIME and COMPLETION
As far back as 1776 , the agenda for total control within a certain alotted completion of time , was in the works .
Of course , it goes back 6,000 illusory years when the whole agenda was conjured up , but here we see , that it had n’t faltered at all with the establishment of the United States of America .
On DECEMBER 21 , 1812 , yet another earthquake struck , with an estimated magnitude of 7 .
This is the number of perfection and completion .
December 21 , 1812 = 12/21/12 – or exactly 200 years to the day before the Winter Solstice of 2012 .
A very strange event takes place every year at the Mission San Juan del Capistrano .
An untold number of SWALLOWS fly south in migration , from Capistrano ( Los Angeles ) to Goya Argentina .
GOYA = YOYA = YAH - WEH = ALLAH = LA
In other words , the SWALLOWS FLY from LA to LA , or from GOD to GOD , albeit under cover of symbolism .
Every year they leave Goya on February 18 , and return to Capistrano ( Los Angeles ) by March 19 .
They return to the same nest , and have been doing so for almost 200 years .
Here ’s the symbolic significance of this event .
WELL OF SOULS = S - WELL ‘O OULS = SWELL - OULS = SWALLOWS
The migration of the Swallows is symbolizing the flood coming from the Antarctic Ice Field , and just as the melting Arctic and Greenland Ice mass is symbolically set to pour down from the COLUMN of British Columbia , the Antarctic Ice Field is set to pour into Los Angeles and beyond , from the COLUMN , or Pillar , of the country of COLUMBIA .
These are the North and South Towers , or Columns of the DOVE , the Living Water , the HOLY SPIRIT of the lord , that ’s meant to cleanse the world with a Global Warming Flood .
As seen previously , in reference to the term HOLY , YELLOW is HOLY , as in YELLOWSTONE , or HOLYSTONE .
The term GEL = YEL , the first 3 letters of YELLOW .
This word can be equated with GEL = WASH = WATER in a symbolic fashion .
WASHINGTON DC = Washingstone Death Sea
YEL = GEL = EYE EL = EYE of GOD = ION the electrically charged particle .
Electricity , ENERGY , the Eye of God , FLOWS LIKE WATER .
Electricity is measured in WATTS , derived from the term WATER , and for this reason the river gods throughout the ages have being looked upon as fertility gods , and the WATERY SEAS looked upon as the tool of cleansing the whole earth .
The fertility concept extending from the electrical energy within the WATERY ION EYE of the luciferian mind , which is the THOUGHT PROCESS .
The cleansing relating to WATERS ABILITY TO REMOVE CORRUPTION or SIN .
These notions together , then relate to the sublime , and the subliminal HYPNOTIC MANIPULATION using the hidden mysteries of the KABBALISTIC MANIPULATION of matter , one molecule at a time .
This is the learned knowledge of the luciferian thinking egregore , of how to direct the spin of sub-atomic particles using the presence of heat generated from a religious , political , sporting , entertainment , or any other emotional gathering of people .
The emotion is the heat , and the greater the gathering , the greater the emotional heat , and the ability to manipulate matter by building the heat , by changing a solid into a gas , by changing emotion into a subliminal event , which is hypnotic suggestion , can thereby conjure forth the illusory world and continue to manipulate it at will .
Definitions :
SUBLIME – to arouse the sensation of awe .
SUBLIME – to pass directly from a solid to a vapour state , usually by the action of heat .
Once again , we have another hidden subliminal intent on cleaning .
Yellowstone is then the WASHING - STONE , or the Judgment Holy Stone of cleansing .
Also , the WASHING - STONE = WASHINGTON .
For this reason , all the symbolism attached to the name WASHINGTON throughout the USA is referring to the Holy Washing Stone of Judgment .
There ’s nothing nice planned for the USA , and by extension , the rest of the world .
The whole illusory Kabbalistic 3d plane was designed to grab our focus through despair , disease , war and death .
Today , as we watch the manipulation of our reality with the Financial Crisis ( Fiance Sea Rises ) , the natural disasters , and so on , the judgment bullshit is transpiring before our eyes and the masses of humanity have n’t the slightest notion of what is actually transpiring .
The manipulation of the illusory mass of humanity , has turned into the hidden gases of the sublime , and the subliminal , and the hypnotic tools used to manipulate our reality thereby disconnect us from our true WISDOM REALITY .
WASHINGTON DC = WASHING STONE Death Sea
WASHINGTON STATE = WASHING STONE ST.8/EIGHT/ATE the consummation of all things under the total control of a few .
Washington State has Mount Olympus .
Seattle , the Seat of El. Medina , the Medium / Media / Messenger of Muhammad .
Redmond , the home of MICROSOFT ( My Cross Of Sacrifice ) .
Also located here , on the 49th parallel , are the 2010 religious Olympics at Vancouver .
This symbolism is coupled with a massive earthquake zone shown on the Foundation Stone that extends all the way to YELLOWSTONE .
Yellowstone , as was just stated , is WASHING - STONE .
Likewise , WASHINGTON , is WASHING - STONE , and the region from Mount Olympus Washington to Yellowstone is intended to break in judgment and wash the world of the contrived notion of sin .
This can only have an effect upon those who stay emotionally connected to the 3 dimensional illusion , placing value and worth on the light show , and thereby remain within the trance state .
( See the Foundation Stone charts just above showing the huge deep cracks of the Seattle Seismic Region ) .
Keep in mind that these areas of Washington State , Idaho , Montana , Wyoming and Colorado form Buildings 5 and 6 on the World Trade Centre layout .
The numbers 5+6=11 , or Death .
These were lesser buildings that were damaged in the attack , though not directly attacked and were subsequently demolished to rebuild the whole site anew .
So it is again , these coinciding states will not be attacked in the luciferian desired cataclysm , but will nonetheless be demolished for a complete renewal .
The obvious question is WHEN ?
The obvious answer is SOON !
Keep watching and waiting , and be concerned for nothing .
This is all an illusion !

YouTube Video highlighting some of the subliminal elements hidden in the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem
Please read the next paragraph before watching the ROCK VIDEO .
On the ROCK VIDEO , the World Trade Center is mistakenly called the ROCKEFELLER PLAZA .
The WTC was conceived and promoted by the Rockefellers .
The Rockefeller Plaza is to the north of the World Trade Centre , on the MANHATTAN ROCK , or MANNA STONE .
The WTC and the Rockefeller Plaza , along with the area of CENTRAL PARK , relate to the TEMPLE MOUNT in Jerusalem , and the Al Aqsa Mosque , the Dome of the ROCK , and the Temple Courtyard .
These in turn relate to the North American West Coast .
See page 39 for more details .

Nathan Goodman called my attention to this recent piece by John Stossel : “ Myths about Capitalism : Confronting the Biggest Lies about American Business . ” I ca n’t resist commenting .
1. Capitalism is mostly cruel and unfair
Notice that the subtitle of Stossel ’s article suggests that “ capitalism ” is synonymous with “ American business . ”
Genuinely freed markets are not mostly cruel and unfair .
But I think it ’s a stretch to assume that the same is true of big businesses that operate with all sorts of privileges from the state and that benefit from a long history of injustice and dispossession .
Big business in America does not enjoy its power and privilege in virtue of a freed market , and there is no reason to think business leaders desire a freed market .
The cruelty and unfairness of big business — at home and abroad — may have little to do with free ( d ) markets , but they ’re systemic features of “ capitalism ” — if by that term is meant “ rule by capitalists ” or “ the economic system we have now . ”
2 . When the rich get richer , the poor get poorer .
In a genuinely freed market , no .
A truly freed market would tend to eat the rich , as Jeremy Weiland has suggested .
But in a market distorted by privilege , in which people get rich not exclusively or primarily because they provide goods and services people want , in which increased wealth is not necessarily a reflection of genuine wealth creation , I suspect it ’s much more likely that some people are despoiled to the advantage of others .
3. Government is more fair and reliable than business .
This is clearly a myth .
But that ’s hardly reason to take a trusting attitude toward big business , which happily utilizes state - secured privilege to the detriment of consumers and workers .
And I suspect that Stossel may be rather too fond of the related myth that government and big business are adversaries rather than , as seems more likely , competitive and sometimes hostile allies .
4 . The current downturn means the death of capitalism .
Nope , it does n’t .
Stossel ’s right .
But not for the reasons he thinks .
He ’s right , in fact , because capitalism is marked by privilege and cronyism , which lay behind the current crisis and which have featured rather too prominently in efforts purportedly intended to address it .
In any case , the partnership between the business elite and the political elite will doubtless continue as long as there ’s anything like the current economic and political order .
The occasional crisis wo n’t be enough to end that order , I fear .
It ’s hard not to see Stossel and Michael Medved , his conversation partner in the segment he discusses in the article , as exhibiting just the uncritical equation of the contemporary economic order with a genuinely freed market that Kevin Carson rightly lampoons as “ vulgar libertarianism . ”
DETROIT --
It appears as if Jiri Hudler is free to re-join the Detroit Red Wings next season .
Reports out of Russia indicate that Hudler has been released from the second year of his two - year deal with Moscow Dynamo because the Kontinental Hockey League club is merging with another team .
Hudler recently expressed to the Red Wings his desire to return to Detroit in 2010 - 11 , either by way of an out clause from his two - year , $ 10 million Russian deal or by release from that contract .
It appers he has received the latter .
That means , barring a turn of events , he can join the Red Wings next season .
He has a two - year deal with Detroit that averages $ 2.875 million a season , which he and the club essentially agreed to in arbitration last summer .
The Red Wings have not received official word of Hudler 's release or what his intentions are for next season .
General manager Ken Holland said recently that he anticipated Hudler will be back next season .
Hudler is not eligible to join the Red Wings in the playoffs .
Hudler , 26 , had career highs in goals ( 23 ) , assists ( 34 ) and points ( 57 ) in 2008 - 09 .
Speaking at NASA ’s Kennedy Space Center April 15 , President Obama outlined a new plan for the space agency that would forgo sending astronauts back to the moon , but would send humans to an asteroid in 2025 and into orbit around Mars a decade later .
The strategy would rely on private aerospace companies to ferry crew and supplies into space .
It would also cancel a program known as Constellation , which is aimed at developing a heavy - lift rocket and vehicles to carry astronauts back to the moon , in favor of pursuing a new rocket that would take humans beyond well beyond that destination .
“ I am very happy about the introduction of new innovative commercial approaches in human space flight , because we ’ve been trapped into a very bad cul - de- sac for 40 years , ” says planetary scientist and former NASA associate administrator for science Alan Stern of the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder , Colo .
Stern predicts that Congress is likely to approve Obama ’s plan .
In Obama ’s blueprint , NASA would get an additional $ 6 billion over the next five years to begin developing new space technologies , refocusing its efforts away from designing space transportation vehicles .
The plan would , however , keep plans to develop the Orion crew vehicle , which would be the only U.S. space transport vehicle once the shuttle is retired later this year .
And in 2015 , the agency would evaluate plans for a rocket that would carry astronauts into deep space .
Early next decade , Obama said , “ a set of crewed flights will test and prove the systems required for exploration beyond low Earth orbit , ” culminating in the first human journey to an asteroid in 2025 .
Journeys to Mars orbit in the mid-2030s would be followed by a landing on Mars , “ and I expect to be around to see it , ” the president told the cheering crowd .
Obama said he recognized that some experts have called it unwise to rely on the private sector for ferrying crews and supplies into space , but “ by buying the services of space transportation rather than the vehicles themselves , we can continue to ensure rigorous safety standards are met but will also accelerate the pace for innovations as companies , from young start - ups to established leaders , compete , design , build and launch new ways of carrying people and materials into space . ”
Norm Augustine , who chaired a committee that last year criticized the Constellation program and NASA funding , spoke after Obama .
The former chairman and chief executive officer of the Lockheed Martin Corp. said the agency “ was trapped in low Earth orbit ” hauling cargo instead of trying to reach a loftier destination in space .
He added that if the agency did n’t rely on U.S. companies to take astronauts into space , it would have no alternative but to rely on Russians .
Obama criticized the Bush administration ’s program to send astronauts back to the moon and then eventually on to Mars as a blueprint that lacked both funding and specific goals .
“ There are also those who have criticized our decision to end parts of Constellation as one that will hinder space exploration beyond low Earth orbit , ” Obama said .
“ But by investing in groundbreaking research and innovative companies , we have the potential to rapidly transform our capabilities . ”
Space - policy analyst Howard McCurdy of American University in Washington , D.C. , says he does n’t see much difference in adherence to timetables and goals between Bush ’s plan and that of Obama’s .
But he says he ’s intrigued by Obama ’s willingness to “ leapfrog ” over smaller goals .
According to McCurdy ’s interpretation , Obama is telling the public “ if we go the moon and concentrate on completing project Constellation , it ’s going to be a dead end , but if we set our sights a little further out and skip those intermediate steps , we can have real accomplishments . ”
It ’s a high - risk proposition , says McCurdy , “ but as long as NASA has a monopoly on space transportation , it ’s going to be like the airline industry in the 1960s — high quality and very expensive .
“ The real key in all of this is the ability of the private sector to do what NASA has been unable to do for about the last 30 years , and that is cut the cost to low Earth orbit .
As long as NASA was spending $ 4 billion to $ 5 billion a year flying the space shuttle , [ the agency ] was going nowhere , ” McCurdy says .

Several California Republican political candidates , including Senate hopeful Carly Fiorina , were scheduled to share the stage this week with one of the leaders of the “ birther ” movement that claims President Obama was not born in this country and is thus ineligible for his elected office .
FOR THE RECORD :
Tea party gathering :
An article in the LATExtra section Wednesday about a controversial speaker whose invitation to appear at a Tax Day Tea Party rally was rescinded gave the wrong name for a consultant to an Assembly candidate who is among those scheduled to speak at the event .
The consultant to San Ramon Mayor Abram Wilson is Jason Roe , not Joe Roe . —
Orly Taitz , an Orange County attorney who has gone to court many times to try to disqualify Obama , was invited to speak Thursday at a Tax Day Tea Party rally in Pleasanton , Calif. , that is expected to draw thousands of people .
Late Tuesday , organizers said that they had rescinded Taitz ’s invitation after questions were raised about her presence by candidates who had been contacted by The Times .
Bridget Melson , founder and president of the Pleasanton Tea Party , said the organization had been “ getting calls from candidates like crazy . ”
“ It ’s not worth it , ” she said .
“ She ’s too controversial .
This is not what the tea party is about at this point . ”
Taitz ’s lawsuits have been thrown out and lambasted by judges and she has been fined $ 20,000 for filing frivolous lawsuits .
But Taitz , who is now running for secretary of state , was nonetheless invited to speak at Thursday ’s event , which is expected to be among the largest Tax Day events in the state .
Taitz ’s invitation -- and uninvitation -- are examples of the complications facing Republicans this year as they try to capture the enthusiasm of the tea party movement without getting sucked into its conspiracy - tinged fringes .
In addition to Fiorina , a representative of Senate candidate Chuck DeVore and several congressional and state legislative candidates are scheduled to speak at the Pleasanton rally .
Spokespersons for Fiorina and DeVore said separately that until they were contacted by The Times , they had been unaware that Taitz was scheduled to speak .
Both said their campaigns had already committed to the event and would attend .
“ I can say emphatically that the Chuck DeVore campaign and Chuck DeVore himself strongly disapproves of Orly Taitz and the crazy theories she continues to advance , ” said Josh Trevino , a DeVore spokesman .
Fiorina spokeswoman Julie Soderlund added that while her candidate disagrees with Obama on issues , she believes he is the legitimately elected president of the United States .
“ President Obama is absolutely eligible for the presidency and is a natural - born United States citizen , ” she said .
One candidate threatened to withdraw from the event before Tuesday ’s decision to uninvite Taitz .
John Dennis , who is running for the Republican nomination to oppose House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in San Francisco , said he would not appear on the same stage as Taitz .
“ The presence of a discredited publicity seeker on the same platform with patriotic Americans distorts the focus of our movement , distracts from our common message and gives ammunition to those who continue to question our legitimacy , ” Dennis said in a statement .
Taitz is best known for her crusade to prove Obama was born in Kenya and not Hawaii , a falsehood that sprang to life during the 2008 presidential campaign and that most voters and mainstream Republicans reject .
But she has also been creating waves in the state Republican Party .
In her quest for the party nomination for secretary of state , she has tried to get the other GOP candidate , Damon Dunn , removed from the ballot on the grounds that he is only pretending to be a Republican .
Dunn is an African American real estate entrepreneur and former NFL football player who has attracted support from powerful GOP figures .
“ The only reason he was endorsed so far is because he is an African American , and Republicans want to have an African American to show diversity , ” Taitz said in a blog post .
Dunn brushed aside her criticism .
In a phone interview Tuesday before her invitation was pulled , Taitz dismissed the dust - up over her planned appearance .
“ Look , the truth is the truth , ” she said .
“ It is important for the public to know .
Just like it took some time but Watergate was investigated and there was resolution .
By the same token , Obama needs to be investigated . ”
California Democratic Party Chairman John Burton said the GOP candidates ’ planned attendance at an event with Taitz was a sign of desperation .
“ If that ’s the base of the Republican Party , the Republicans are in very serious trouble , ” he said .
Others said that GOP candidates merely needed to distance themselves from Taitz ’s message .
Not everyone speaking at the event would do so , however , including a top state party official who said Obama ’s birthplace is not settled .
“ I certainly do n’t have enough information to decide that , ” said Tom Del Beccaro , vice chair of the California Republican Party .
“ I ’ve never seen yay or nay either way , so how could I know ? ”
And a consultant to San Ramon Mayor Abram Wilson , a candidate for state Assembly who is speaking Thursday , declined to say where Wilson believed Obama was born .
“ Given the things going on in our state right now , the last thing I am thinking about is where Barack Obama was born , ” consultant Jason Roe quoted Wilson as saying .
FOR THE RECORD :
An earlier version of this article incorrectly referred to consultant Jason Roe as Joe Roe .

Tecmo's reboot of the console classic Tecmo Bowl arrives on Xbox Live on April 28 for 800 Microsoft Points , but there 's no word yet on when PlayStation owners get in on the fun .

A news release from Tecmo said only " A release on PlayStation Network will soon follow . "
Throwback will deliver an old - school 2D mode and an updated 3D presentation whose gameplay matches what you remember from the original Tecmo Bowl and Tecmo Super Bowl on the Nintendo Entertainment System .
Though the game has no NFL or NFL Players '
Association licensing , its roster will more or less match the performers from the 1991 game , just under different names .
It also includes online multiplayer and a stupefyingly easy achievement set .
No word if the halftime show still features cheerleader upskirts , though .
People Capital
President Obama ’s plan to have the government provide loans directly to students instead of using commercial lenders was resurrected on Thursday , when Democratic leaders agreed to bundle it into an expedited budget package along with the health care overhaul .
Now , the student loan measure , which had been unlikely to pass on its own , could be passed in the Senate along with the health care measure by a simple majority vote .
Still , there ’s no guarantee of passage for the measure , which would also expand the Pell grant program for low - income students .
In the meantime , there ’s another new source of student loans emerging for students looking for additional education financing : wealthy investors .
Earlier this month , the online student loan Web site People Capital began a peer - to - peer student loan service that matches students looking for loans directly with potential lenders , including individual lenders , and takes financial institution brokers out of the loan - finding equation .
Here ’s how it works : Students sign up on the site and put in their loan requests .
Lenders , meanwhile , sign up on the site and put up at least $ 1,000 for loans in a People Capital account .
They then can bid on the various loan requests from students and assess various students ’ risk and ability to repay with the help of People Capital ’s proprietary “ Human Capital ” score , which combines variables like SAT scores and grade point averages to determine a student ’s future income potential and ability to repay .
A spokesman said People Capital also follows the student loan industry standard verification processes that includes confirmation of SAT and G.P.A. data by a student ’s college or university .
In the auction process , the lender offering the lowest interest rate wins the loan , and money from the lender ’s People Capital account is then sent to student ’s college .
To participate , lenders must be accredited investors and meet certain criteria , including either an annual income of $ 200,000 or assets of at least $ 1 million .
Financial institutions could sign up to be lenders , but so far all five investors who have signed up to give loans have been wealthy individuals .
Why would someone sign up to be a lender ?
Alan Samuels , People Capital ’s chief product officer , said two main motivations emerged in the discussions with lenders during the development of the platform : a desire to increase profits through diversification and philanthropic reasons .
“ There is definitely a profit maximizing objective — people looking at a student loan as a slightly different asset , ” he said .
“ And there is another group of investors that say , ‘ I want to make a return , but I want to be doing good at the same time . ’ ”
Unlike more general consumer loans available on other peer - to - peer lending sites , qualified education loans available through People Capital are private student loans that are legally compliant , offer tax - deductible interest payments for borrowers and ca n’t be discharged in bankruptcy .
But unlike some government - backed student loans , repayments are n’t deferred until after graduation .
Instead , the loans , which come in various short - term and longer - term forms , have more immediate repayment mechanisms , like interest - only or minimum payments .
Al Alper , president of People Capital , said such requirements are n’t too much of a burden to students .
He said , for instance , that a minimum monthly interest - only payment of $ 50 would be about the equivalent of having a pizza a week in a dorm room .
People Capital takes an origination fee of a few hundred dollars from the student and servicing fees of about 1 percent from the lender .
Why would a student sign up for such loans ?
The People Capital spokesmen said the service gives students more access to capital at a time when tuition is increasing and many other sources of financing are harder to get , especially for students with a limited credit history .
To receive one of the qualified student loans , a student must be enrolled in an eligible university program , must be a United States citizen and be at least 17 or 18 years old depending on the state , among other requirements .
As of this week , the five investors have lent a total of about $ 100,000 , split among five to six students .
Meanwhile , about 45 students have put in loan requests for a combined total of about $ 500,000 and another 100 or so students are going through the sign - up process .
Of course , students should make sure to maximize low - rate federal student loans first .
What do you think of peer - to - peer student loan lending ?
Would you make such a loan to student or sign on to one yourself ?
Why or why not ?
Wil je meer weten over zorgverzekeringen ?
Lees dan alles over zorg vergelijken om geld te besparen .
Er wordt in de media altijd veel gesproken over zorgverzekeringen , maar wat is zorgverzekering nu precies ?
Een ziektekostenverzekering is een manier om ervoor te zorgen dat als je ziek bent of een ongeluk hebt dat je geen grote medische rekeningen hoeft te betalen .
Welke kosten zijn er beschikbaar voor alle zorgverzekeringen op dit moment ?
De kosten van medische zorg zijn meer dan de meeste mensen zich kunnen veroorloven om in één keer te betalen , dus de ziektekostenverzekering is een manier om regelmatig kleinere bedragen te betalen , zodat als je medische behandelingen nodig hebt , het bedrijf het geld heeft om het te betalen .
Natuurlijk krijgt niet iedereen hetzelfde terug als ze hebben betaald in behandelingen en sommige krijgen veel meer , maar het is een verzekering tegen het moeten betalen van enorme rekeningen als je wel medische zorg nodig hebt of niet in staat bent om de behandeling te krijgen die je nodig hebt als je het geld niet hebt .
Natuurlijk is de vraag wat een ziektekostenverzekering is eigenlijk te simplistisch , want er zijn veel dingen die gedekt worden door deze verzekering .
Maar wat ze allemaal gemeen hebben is dat ze de medische kosten betalen voor de persoon die de verzekering heeft als ze ziek worden of een ongeluk krijgen .
Er kunnen uitsluitingen worden toegepast op de verzekering , zodat de verzekeraar niet de enorme kosten hoeft te betalen die met sommige ziekten gepaard gaan .
Dit is nog meer het geval bij sommige goedkopere dekkingspolissen , omdat dit een manier is waarop de verzekeraar de kosten laag kan houden .
Welke vormen van zorgverzekeringen zijn er beschikbaar ?
Er zijn echt twee basisvormen van zorgverzekering .
Er is een particuliere ziektekostenverzekering en er is ook een openbare ziektekostenverzekering .
Als u een particuliere ziektekostenverzekering koopt , moet u het beste bedrijf vinden door alle bedrijven in uw prijsklasse door te lichten , zodat u de beste deal voor uw geld krijgt .

SEC suit against Goldman Sachs ( full complaint here , and well worth reading ) is explosive stuff .
Essentially the SEC seems to have nailed down the kind of behavior that ProPublica was looking for in its story on the Magnetar Trade -- a hedge fund which was short mortgages , in this case Paulson , was carefully picking nuclear waste to put into synthetic CDOs , unbeknownst to the final investors in those deals .

The SEC suit against Goldman Sachs ( full complaint here , and well worth reading ) is explosive stuff .
Essentially the SEC seems to have nailed down the kind of behavior that ProPublica was looking for in its story on the Magnetar Trade — a hedge fund which was short mortgages , in this case Paulson , was carefully picking nuclear waste to put into synthetic CDOs , unbeknownst to the final investors in those deals .
From the complaint :
GS&Co marketing materials for ABACUS 2007 - AC1 – including the term sheet , flip book and offering memorandum for the CDO – all represented that the reference portfolio of RMBS underlying the CDO was selected by ACA Management LLC ( “ ACA ” ) , a third - party with experience analyzing credit risk in RMBS .
Undisclosed in the marketing materials and unbeknownst to investors , a large hedge fund , Paulson & Co. Inc. ( “ Paulson ” ) , with economic interests directly adverse to investors in the ABACUS 2007 - AC1 CDO , played a significant role in the portfolio selection process .
It seems here that ACA was somewhere between a useful idiot and an outright victim of Goldman ’s Fabrice Tourre :
Tourre also misled ACA into believing that Paulson invested approximately $ 200 million in the equity of ABACUS 2007 - AC1 ( a long position ) and , accordingly , that Paulson ’s interests in the collateral section process were aligned with ACA ’s when in reality Paulson ’s interests were sharply conflicting .
Essentially what Goldman was doing here was using the respected ACA brand name ( it would n’t remain respected for long ) in order to attract big investors like Germany ’s IKB : they even said in an email that “ we expect to leverage ACA ’s credibility and franchise to help distribute this Transaction . ”
But ACA was to a large extent a front for Paulson , as is evidenced in the name of the spreadsheet where it listed the proposed contents of the CDO :
On January 22 , 2007 , ACA sent an email to Tourre and others at GS&Co with the subject line , “ Paulson Portfolio 1-22-10.xls . ”
The text of the email began , “ Attached please find a worksheet with 86 sub - prime mortgage positions that we would recommend taking exposure to synthetically …
On February 5 , 2007 , Paulson sent an email to ACA , with a copy to Tourre , deleting eight RMBS recommended by ACA , leaving the rest , and stating that Tourre agreed that 92 bonds were a sufficient portfolio .
On February 5 , 2007 , an internal ACA email asked , “ Attached is the revised portfolio that Paulson would like us to commit to – all names are at the Baa2 level .
The final portfolio will have between 80 and these 92 names .
Are ‘ we ’ ok to say yes on this portfolio ? ”
The response was , “ Looks good to me . ”
I think that the SEC has the right defendant here .
Paulson and ACA are both culpable , but it ’s Goldman which was clearly central to the plan of deceiving investors into believing that the CDO was being managed by people who wanted it to make money , when in fact it was being structured by the biggest short - seller in the entire subprime market .
And although ACA should never have been so passive in terms of accepting the names given to it by Paulson , it did reasonably believe , because it was essentially lied to by Goldman Sachs , that Paulson was in the deal to make money on the long side :
On January 10 , 2007 , Tourre emailed ACA a “ Transaction Summary ” that included a description of Paulson as the “ Transaction Sponsor ” and referenced a “ Contemplated Capital Structure ” with a “ [ 0 ] % – [ 9 ] % : pre-committed first loss ” as part of the Paulson deal structure .
The description of this [ 0 ] % – [ 9 ] % tranche at the bottom of the capital structure was consistent with the description of an equity tranche and ACA reasonably believed it to be a reference to the equity tranche .
In fact , GS& Co never intended to market to anyone a “ [ 0 ] % – [ 9 ] % ” first loss equity tranche in this transaction …
On February 12 , 2007 , ACA ’s Commitments Committee approved the firm ’s participation in ABACUS as portfolio selection agent .
The written approval memorandum described Paulson ’s role as follows : “ the hedge fund equity investor wanted to invest in the 0 - 9 % tranche of a static mezzanine ABS CDO backed 100 % by subprime residential mortgage securities . ”
The really crazy thing about this deal is that ACA not only managed the CDO , but also wrote the credit protection underlying most of it :
On or about May 31 , 2007 , ACA Capital sold protection or “ wrapped ” the $ 909 million super senior tranche of ABACUS 2007 - AC1 , meaning that it assumed the credit risk associated with that portion of the capital structure …
ACA Capital was unaware of Paulson ’s short position in the transaction .
It is unlikely that ACA Capital would have written protection on the super senior tranche if it had known that Paulson , which played an influential role in selecting the reference portfolio , had taken a significant short position instead of a long equity stake .
In a sense , then , IKB and the other investors in the deal were right to think that ACA was genuinely managing this structure to make money , and believed that it was sound .
After all , if it all went to zero — as it eventually did — ACA stood to lose hundreds of millions of dollars .
But what happened here was that both IKB and ACA Capital placed their trust in ACA Management .
And Goldman , armed with hefty CDO management fees and sleazy lies about Paulson ’s role in the transaction , turned ACA Management from a bona fide fund manager into a useful idiot who could be relied upon to buy exactly the subprime securities that Paulson wanted to short .
With this suit , the SEC has finally uncovered the real scandal behind the Abacus deals .
The NYT tried , back in December , but it did n’t quite get to the nub of the story — although Paulson was mentioned in the NYT story as someone who was generally short the subprime market , there was no indication that he played any role in structuring the deals .
Neither was there any mention of ACA .
The scandal here is not that Goldman was short the subprime market at the same time as marketing the Abacus deal .
The scandal is that Goldman sold the contents of Abacus as being handpicked by managers at ACA when in fact it was handpicked by Paulson ; and that it told ACA that Paulson had a long position in the deal when in fact he was entirely short .
Goldman Sachs has lost more than $ 10 billion in market capitalization today , in the wake of these revelations .
Good .
It can go long markets and it can go short markets .
But it ca n’t lie to its clients .
That ’s well beyond the pale .
Update : The Abacus pitch book can be seen here .
Besides challenging you academically , college affords students the opportunity to experiment with their own interests that may not always seem practically applicable to the real world .
But sometimes , with the right mix of people , talent and ambition , college can be the perfect breeding ground for true art and even international success and fame .
These ten bands started in college , but ended up playing for millions of fans all over the world .
R.E.M. : American musical group R.E.M. began achieving success in the 1980s , and by the end of the decade , had established themselves as more than just a cult rock band with major hits like " The One I Love " and " Shiny Happy People . "
Once named " America 's Best Rock & Roll Band " by Rolling Stone , R.E.M. was founded in Athens , GA , in 1980 , by lead vocalist Michael Stipe and guitarist Peter Buck .
Stipe and Buck quickly recruited other students from the University of Georgia , bass guitarist Mike Mills and drums and percussion player Bill Berry .
Their first show was at a friend 's birthday party , but they soon dropped out of college to go on tour in the South and record an album .
MGMT : MGMT's " psychedelic pop " sound — coined by David Marchese of Spin — originated during low - key jam sessions at Wesleyan University .
Ben Goldwasser and Andrew VanWyngarden teamed up during their freshman year and played on campus until they graduated in 2005 .
The now - Brooklyn - based MGMT — first known as The Management — began touring , and in 2006 , they signed with Columbia Records .
Their first big album Oracular Spectacular was instantly a hit on college campuses , in clubs and in Europe .
Radiohead : Another 1990s - era rock band that has continued to enjoy critical and commercial success is Radiohead .
The band was formed in 1985 when Thom Yorke , Colin Greenwood , Ed O'Brien and Phil Selway were attending an all - boys school in Oxfordshire , England .
At the time , the band was called " On a Friday , " and the members stuck together on weekends and over holidays when they returned home from university .
During a show at the Jericho Tavern in Oxfordshire , Radiohead 's present manager Chris Hufford heard them play and agreed to produce a demo tape for them .
They signed a six - album record deal in 1991 .
Better Than Ezra : Although not as widely known as Radiohead or R.E.M. , Better Than Ezra is a popular southern rock band among college students and New Orleans - area music lovers .
Better Than Ezra was formed in 1988 at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge .
Kevin Griffin , Joel Rundell , Tom Drummond and Cary Bonnecaze released their first official album in 1989 called Surprise , but a year later , lead guitarist Joel Rundell committed suicide .
After a break , the band reunited and eventually had a number - one hit on the Hot Modern Rock Charts in 1995 .
The Strokes : When The Strokes broke onto the music scene in the late 90s and early 2000s , rock fans greatly appreciated their bare - bones approach to old - fashioned rock 'n ' roll guitar music .
Band members Julian Casablancas , Nick Valensi , Albert Hammond Jr. , Nikolai Fraiture and Fabrizio Moretti released Is This
It in 2001 , but they had known each other in some way since their prep school days in New York and Switzerland , where Casablancas was sent because of drinking problems and where he met Hammond .
The band formed when Hammond moved from Switzerland to NYU and rented an apartment with Casablancas .
They began playing at bars and clubs on the Lower East Side and released the U.S. version of Is This It after recording a UK version .
Styx :
Some of the best cheesy party music includes Styx songs like " Mr. Roboto " and " Lady , " even today .
The band started when twin brothers Chuck and John Panozzo organized with neighbor Dennis DeYoung in the early 60s .
Over the next few years , the band went through some changes , including changing their name from Trade Winds to TW4 , and enrolling in Chicago State University .
Another student , John Curulewski , and James " J.Y . "
Young joined the band , and by the early 1970s , the band had released several recordings and had regular gigs at local frat parties and clubs .
Pink Floyd : Iconic rock group Pink Floyd is one of the few bands who wholly encompasses the rebellious but philosophical mood of the 1960s and 70s , yet is still influential and relevant today .
The English band was formed by Nick Mason and Roger Waters , who were both architecture students at the Regent Street Polytechnic in London .
They played with other members until 1965 , when after a juggling of drop - outs , Air Force postings and new members , The Pink Floyd Sound was formed and became the resident band at the Countdown Club in London .
Coldplay : British band Coldplay , led by lead vocalist Chris Martin , has one of the most unique sounds in rock music today , and is celebrated for its pop-meets - alternative - meets - New Age style .
The band was first organized by Martin and lead guitarist Jonny Buckland , who met during orientation week at University College London .
They called their band Pectoralz , but renamed themselves Starfish a year later , as they welcomed another UCL student , Guy Gerryman , into the band .
Martin recruited Phil Harvey as manager , and Will Champion joined soon after as percussionist .
The group adopted the name Coldplay after a student who'd had a band by the same name suggested the change .
Queen : Rock and Roll Hall of Fame member Queen has released numerous hit albums over the last few decades , earning popularity for their upbeat sound , which features synthesizers , rock , pop , glam rock and disco elements .
The band was first formulated when Imperial College student and guitarist Brian May and bass player Tim Staffell got together and recruited dental student Roger Taylor to be their drummer .
They named their band Smile and welcomed new band member Farrokh " Freddie " Bulsara into the group .
Staffell eventually left to join another band , and Smile became known as Queen .
By 1971 , Queen accepted John Deacon as their regular bass player , and the group recorded four original songs .
Creed : American rock band Creed peaked in the late 1990s and early 2000s with hits like " My Sacrifice " and " One Last Breath . "
Lead vocalist Scott Stapp and guitarist Mark Tremonti met in high school but formed the band when they were students at Florida State University in Tallahassee , FL .
Brian Marshall and Scott Phillips rounded out the group and released their first independent album in three years later , in 1997 .

You ’d probably be surprised to learn that she has an identical twin , though , that you ’ve never met .
I like looking at words that appear to have assigned duties , no further inquiry needed , and then take the dubious course of championing a new way of looking at them .
A waste of time ?
Maybe .
But those who look for immutable meaning will always be wrong , never mind the apparent contradiction .
Language , and therefore meaning , is always changing .
Let ’s just look at that sturdy little word “ individual . ”
You know what it means as well as I do .
But only about 500 years ago , it had the exact opposite definition : member of a group .
How can that happen ?
The short answer is , “ No one knows . ”
Social evolution , including language , is never easy to see when it ’s right in front of you .
It takes some time to notice what changes have happened while you thought everything was standing still .
That maiden is called Faith , of whom I ’ve written before , but with a different purpose .
I just want to take a quick look at her sibling , Fidelity .
Faith and Fidelity have the same Latin mother , with the odd name Fides .
But they left home some time ago now .
Fidelity means to hold true , to have allegiance , to be steadfast .
More simply , to be loyal .
One can have faith without fidelity – e.g. , the myriad New Age religious carpetbaggers , who flit from one nest to another in search of the best spiritual high .
But one can also easily show fidelity without the least interest in faith or belief of any kind .
Does anyone really think that the abandonment of a faith or belief in God , for instance , suddenly causes a person to lose all moral conviction , to become rootless , without principle ?
Fidelity is simply what remains after faith ( in its conventional sense ) is abandoned .
This is the shortest defense of pure atheism I can offer , one which I think is sufficient to the task , as it ’s not my main concern .
One can easily hold true , for instance , to a high standard of morality – and more important , nobility – without the least belief in a higher governing power of any kind whatsoever .
Nobility itself is the act of not passing on harms done to oneself to others , which is certainly an allegiance to a high moral standard .
I do want to make very clear , however , that atheism as such has no more to do with who and what one is as a person than does religiosity ; people of all stripes do all manner of things , both good and bad , no matter what they ’re faithful to , no matter what standard of fidelity , no matter what they believe .
Well - meaning individuals can acquiesce to mass murder with all the enthusiasm of a tailgate party , if it ’s for the right cause – or , I might say , the right team .
Go America squad !
Shock and awe me , dude !
Social evolution , unfortunately , is not necessarily upward , as new cultural norms can allow and even reinforce group behavior that ordinarily would be intolerable .
Once enough people get on board ordinary standards of decency need not apply .
So it seems to me that , for some , it might be nice if Faith and Fidelity move back home .
It ’s clear enough that Faith cannot always ward off acts of evil .
And Fidelity , by herself , can be lonely .
Faith and Fidelity together , in allegiance with our best nature , are noble sisters .
NEW YORK - Though illiteracy here and across the U.S. continues to be a growing social problem , efforts to combat it are under attack by the city and state legislature , under the guise of reigning in runaway spending .
The state budget proposals now being debated slash $ 2 million from the city ’s adult literacy program - one third of its total budget .
Already $ 612,000 had been cut from the budget , meaning that , altogether , a full quarter of all money allocated to improving the city ’s adult literacy rate has been or is proposed to be slashed .
Additionally , the budget proposes a cut of $ 1.5 million to GED testing sites .
The lack of basic literacy skills leads has a direct correclation to unemployment and poverty .
According to the National Institute for Literacy , 43 percent of those with the lowest literacy skills live in poverty .
This , in turn , often leads to a life of desperation and crime : 85 percent of juvenile offenders are functionally or marginally illiterate and 70 percent of all prisoners in state and federal jails are illiterate .
As of 2007 , says the NIL , “ 42 million American adults ca n’t read at all ; 50 million are unable to read at a higher level that is expected of a fourth or fifth grader . ”
In addition , that number was on the increase by 2.25 million people per year .
Government , advocates say , needs to step in .
Cutting programs to combat illiteracy can only lead to more unemployment , poverty and crime , and will cause the children of illiterate adults to do worse in school .
According to City Council member Sara Gonzalez , who spoke at an April 6 rally on the steps of City Hall against the cuts , “ Being able to speak English well and having a high school diploma are critical stepping stones towards self - sufficiency .
In addition , parents are better able to assist their children with schoolwork ” if they are able to read and write .
According to the National Center for Education Statistics , part of the U.S. Department of Higher Education , 22 percent of New Yorkers lack basic literacy skills .
That number is higher in poorer communities .
The number is 37 percent in Brooklyn and 41 percent in the Bronx .
As the budget fight continues , students , volunteer tutors and program administrators have vowed to continue to struggle .
With our last experiment , we found that a simplified download page drove conversions up 2.3 % .
We hypothesized that much of this improvement was due to improved page load speed .
Today , we ’ll test this theory — answering not just whether speed matters , but also how much it matters .
Specifically , we want to know : for each second improvement in page load speed , by how much does our conversion rate improve ?
Let ’s begin by answering a simpler question : was there a difference in page load speed between visitors who downloaded Firefox and visitors who did n’t ?
We could compare average page load times , but that metric only tells part of the story and can be heavily skewed by outliers .
Instead , let ’s look at the distribution of page load speed of these two groups ( 1 = visitors who downloaded , 0 = visitors who did not download ) :
The difference is surprisingly large .
Half of the downloaders loaded our landing page in under 2.10 seconds .
For non-downloaders , that figure was 3.67 seconds — 75 % slower .
Furthermore , a quarter of non-downloaders waited over 7 seconds for our page to load !
Now that we ’ve confirmed a difference exists , let ’s estimate by how much page load speed improves conversions .
To do so , I ran a simple logistic regression , controlling for the experimental variations .
We found that a 1 second increase in page load time decreases conversions by 2.7 % !
Assuming our model is correctly specified , we have massive room from improvement and can easily increase our conversion rate by 5 – 10 % .
We must be careful , however , not to reach too far with our conclusions .
There are two factors which complicate our analysis .
First , page load speed does not precisely measure what we care about .
What ’s important is n’t whether the page fully loads , but rather how quickly our main calls to action appear .
Nonetheless , page load time serves as a strong proxy for visible content .
Second , our model suffers from omitted variable bias .
We may imagine , for example , that visitors with faster Internet connections are naturally more inclined to download Firefox .
In this case , it ’s not page load speed that explains the higher conversion rate , but rather an unknown variable that ’s correlated with both page load speed and download conversions .
Correlation is not the same thing as causation , but as Tufte said , it ’s a darn good hint !
And we can verify this hint by running a second experiment .
With the help of Ryan Doherty and Frederic Wenzel , we have already built an optimized version of the IE download page .
By randomly assigning users to either this faster variation or the slower control , we will learn whether speed itself drove a higher conversion rate .
Look for a discussion of our results later this week .
Robotics pioneer , prosthetics visionary , and 2007 recipient of a MacArthur " genius " grant , Japanese - born Yoky Matsuoka used to describe herself as an " airhead . "
Now she is a leading researcher in neurobotics , an emerging field that combines neuroscience with building robots .
Her lab at the University of Washington in Seattle is working to develop advanced artificial hands and other body parts that will one day use signals directly from the brain to enhance the motor skills of individuals who have suffered amputation , spinal cord damage , and other traumatic injuries .
In the following interview , learn more about Matsuoka 's work , her life , and how she finally came to embrace her talents as a scientist .
Hand craft Q : What is the " anatomically correct " robotic hand ?
Yoky Matsuoka :
It 's an advanced prosthetic that , once finished , will seem identical to a human hand .
It will look like one , move like one , and it will even be controlled by the brain like a real hand .
The prototype we 're working on in my lab is different from every other prosthetic that 's ever been built .
It 's made of bone - shaped structures and has tiny motors that act as muscles and threads that work like tendons .
There are 30 motors in all , which will be controlled by the same neurosignals that are sent to our real muscles .
It 's really cool because in the process of building this hand , we 're learning a lot about how the brain works .
Q : How can the brain be used to control a machine ?
Matsuoka :
When our brains tell our real hands to move , it feels very natural , and it's not something we 're always conscious of .
In order to replicate this behavior with robotic technology , we will first need to understand how brain signals work and then design our prosthetic hand to read these commands and express them fluidly .
The signals will travel from the brain through the arm muscles and into wires leading to the hand .
This process is known as " neurobotics " or " neuro robotics , " which is a fairly new scientific field .
Q : You 've mentioned before that some people think neurobotics sounds a little like science fiction .
How do you feel about that ?
Matsuoka :
Well , I think it 's a good point because the technology is n't fully here yet .
Although some preliminary work has been done in the field , it could be 30 years before a patient gets to use a prosthetic hand as realistic as what we 're trying to create in my lab .
But I like the science - fiction comparison because it lets me relate to people .
Whenever someone asks me what I do , it 's easy to describe Star Wars and say " Remember the scene where Luke gets a new hand and it looks and moves like a real hand , except there 's a little door on his arm that reveals mechanical parts moving around ?
That 's what I 'm making . "
This gives people an immediate understanding of my research .
It 's amusing to me because I began work on this hand before I ever saw Star Wars .
Courting robotics Q : What first got you interested in robotics ?
Matsuoka : Growing up in Japan , I played a lot of tennis .
I 've always been very competitive in everything I 've done , so I started obsessing over it , pushing myself beyond my physical limits from about age 13 .
But to really do well at a sport like this , I realized I needed a partner with just the right skill set to test me where I needed improvement .
As I got older , I fantasized about creating a robotic tennis partner that I could customize to challenge me in all the necessary ways .
I thought it would be great to be able to program different players for different days depending on what I needed to work on .
Later on , when I was in graduate school at MIT , my adviser had several of us build a humanoid robot called Cog , which students are continuing to work on today .
Different body parts were up for grabs , so I volunteered to work on the hands .
I felt that as a tennis player I could benefit from learning more about how our hands and arms function , although the robot I dreamed of building is still a long way away .
Q : Even without a tennis robot , you managed to make the qualifying rounds for Wimbledon , which is no small feat .
What made you stop playing competitively ?
Matsuoka :
Well , one reason was that even though I strived to be the best , I never had the mindset of " I 'm going to make it " that a lot of people have .
It was more like I was on a highway where the other cars were going to a location called " Professional Tennis Career " and I did n't consider getting off at that exit .
The other issue was that I got injured a lot .
I was waking up at 6:30 , going to school , then going to tennis camp two hours away , doing my homework while taking the train to the camp , and then getting home at 10:30 at night without having eaten dinner .
But the mental toughness it took to do this was n't enough because my body was n't built to take it .
I broke my ankle three times , I snapped my Achilles tendon , I hurt my back .
I had a pretty severe injury almost every year so I finally had to stop obsessing and focus on other things .
Q : Why did you push yourself so hard ?
Matsuoka : I wanted to stand out .
When I was little , my parents were big fans of John McEnroe , who was a legendary tennis player .
Whenever they would cheer for him I would think to myself , " Oh , he 's supposed to be really cool ; I 'm supposed to like him . "
And I did like him because he was different from other people .
He did n't care what anyone else thought of him , yet he was popular .
In Japan , being young and being a girl made it very hard to be bold in the John McEnroe way .
It was n't acceptable for me to express my opinions , so I admired people who could do that with pride .
I still tried to stand out , but only in ways that I thought would be acceptable .
Since it was okay for me to be competitive in tennis , that 's what I worked hard at .
Rise and fall of an airhead Q : Did your obsession with success translate to other parts of your life ?
Matsuoka :
It did in a lot of ways .
For example , after I moved to the States when I was 16 , I realized that acting smart or talented in school gave my classmates the wrong impression of me .
It made me sound like a geek or nerd , and I really did n't want to be labeled those things .
So I remodeled myself as an airhead .
It turned out that when I acted dumb , I got to have more popular friends .
But I was also secretly very good at math and science , and I never sacrificed that .
Instead , I lied to my friends about which classes I was taking .
In college at Berkeley I declared proudly that I did n't buy any textbooks , and I worked hard to show that I never studied .
But then I would have to hide in the library days before each test and do nothing but study .
I wanted to be popular without compromising the quality of what I was learning .
It was very difficult — I was living a double life .
Q : You 're obviously not an airhead today .
When did things change ?
Matsuoka :
It did n't happen until I was a second - year graduate student .
My classmates and I had to welcome the incoming students and try to entice them into doing the kinds of research we were working on .
We all wore nametags and I thought it would be cool if I wrote " Airhead " on mine instead of " Yoky . "
But as I walked around campus that day , I could tell by the looks on people 's faces that they did n't find this funny .
Around that time , my adviser Rod Brooks pulled me aside and said " Look , Yoky .
Stop acting like an airhead .
It 's not going to take you far . "
That was the first time I realized that pretending to be dumb was n't the best idea in the world .
I was at a first - class school doing really great research under a talented mentor .
This double life was only going to hold me back .
Q : You 've accomplished a lot since that day .
What was it like winning the prestigious MacArthur Fellowship ?
Matsuoka :
There 's a funny story that goes along with this .
I got the call about the award while I was feeding my then eight - day - old baby .
The guy on the phone said " I 'm about to tell you something surprising so if you 're holding anything fragile like a baby , please put it down . "
I said , " I do have a baby , but I can't put him down right now because he 's nursing . "
The caller started laughing .
He apparently always used this line as a joke , so that I was actually holding a baby was unexpected .
But when he told me , it was a true honor .
The MacArthur Fellowship is also known as the " genius award , " so it 's about as prestigious as can be , except for maybe the Nobel Prize and a few others .
It was definitely not something I ever thought I would receive .
Q : What drives you to succeed today ?
Matsuoka : I 've realized now that I only have one lifetime to do the best that I can do , just like my role models have done .
I 've been given a chance to make a difference in society — to change the world — and I can't pretend to be an airhead or anything else that I 'm not because it will only hold me back .
I build hands because I want everyone to have a chance to experience their full human capability .
Hands are what set us apart from other species .
We built this society because we have dexterity and can use tools .
Role modeling Q : Tell me about your role models .
Matsuoka :
They have always been people who were n't afraid to challenge conventional ideas .
Everyone used to call John McEnroe the " bad boy of tennis , " and similarly many people consider Rod Brooks the " bad boy of robotics . "
Rod thinks wild ideas that other people do n't think of and wo n't accept , and he pushes for those ideas because he does n't see a limit to what man can do .
My role models are people with a lot of attitude .
I think that because of this , my work has a lot of attitude .
No one has tried to build prosthetics to be as realistic as what I 'm making , and I like that my work is very different .
Q : Do you consider yourself a role model ?
Matsuoka : I hope that I am .
I believe that society will only advance if people learn from the previous generations and then try to become better than them .
I want to be a role model for young scientists and for my children so that they can see what I strived for and change the world more than I have .
The MacArthur Fellowship was never about money to me .
People focus on the prize and ask , " Well , what are you going to use this money on ? "
It 's not about that , but rather about the attention I can now bring to neurobotics and the opportunity I have to encourage more women to enter into the sciences .
I want to continue the work people have done to make it more socially acceptable for young girls to pursue their dreams .
Q : Do you think women in particular have to push themselves like you did in order to succeed in science ?
Matsuoka : I think that currently in the fields of science and engineering , women have to be pretty tough just to be taken seriously .
They have to be very competitive , manage their time extremely well , and be the type of people that constantly push themselves to the limit .
I feel that one reason I pushed myself so hard growing up and in school was because I wanted to prove myself not only as Yoky , but as a woman .
Q : How would you make it easier for girls to pursue math and science ?
Matsuoka :
What I really would like to do , starting at kindergarten and going through high school , is to change the image of math and science .
I would like to show them the big picture , that these fields can be used to help people , because I think everyone can relate to that .
I think " cool " in high school is whatever you do that gains you acceptance .
It 's the acceptance that comes from listening to the right kind of music , having the right kind of hairstyle , wearing the right kind of makeup , and so on .
I would like for people to eventually think that the more science you do , the cooler you are by the high - school definition .
If we give young girls or anyone else a sense of purpose for what they are doing , they will become more interested in doing it well .
" The group is looking at the whole domestic structure and part of that will be Twenty20 cricket , " a senior source told The Daily Telegraph .
" We will also look at the bidding system in terms of how that operates and whether the model we have at the moment is the best model or not .
A few of the guys have been out to India and we are convinced there are enough investors in India alone who would be willing to buy into a franchise . "

HOUSTON - Human adult stem cells injected around the damage caused by a heart attack survived in the heart and improved its pumping efficiency for a year in a mouse model , researchers at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center report online ahead of publication in Circulation Research .
The study , with researchers at the Texas Heart Institute at St. Luke 's Episcopal Hospital , used innovative imaging techniques developed by researchers at MD Anderson to track the stem cells ' location and performance over time .
Injection of a patient 's own adult stem cells into the heart has shown some efficacy in assisting recovery after a heart attack in early human clinical trials , said study senior author Edward T. H. Yeh , M.D. , professor and chair of MD Anderson 's Department of Cardiology .
" But nobody knows how they work , or how long the stem cells last and function in the heart , " Yeh said .
" This study shows how one type of adult stem cell works . "
The team 's research focused on adult stem cells - those that can differentiate into a limited variety of tissues - that circulate in the blood and are distinguished by the presence of the CD34 protein on the cell surface .
These CD34 - positive cells usually differentiate into blood vessel cells , also known as endothelial cells .
Earlier research by Yeh and colleagues showed CD34 + cells are capable of becoming heart muscle cells , called cardiomyocytes , blood vessel cells and smooth muscle cells .
A series of experiments showed :
The CD34 + cells survived in the left ventricle of the heart for 12 months or longer .
Left ventricular ejection fraction - a measure of how much blood is pumped from the heart to other organs at each contraction - improved in treated mice compared with controls for 52 weeks .
LVEF went from 50 percent at baseline to 37 percent after heart attack and treatment , compared with 51 percent and 28 percent in untreated mice .
This improvement was the result of increased blood vessel formation in and around the injured area , or paracrine signaling by the stem cells to other nearby cells , rather than formation of new heart muscle .
Using an antibody technique developed by Yeh and colleagues , the team found that antibodies that blocked formation of new blood vessels completely negated the treatment benefit while antibodies that blocked heart muscle cell formation had no effect .
Ventricular ejection fraction measures the percentage of blood pumped from the heart at each contraction and is one of the most important measures of how the heart functions , Yeh said .
LVEF normally is around 55 to 60 percent .
Some cancer chemotherapies weaken the heart .
" Oncologists pay very close attention to the ejection fraction in their patients , because when it drops , they wo n't give chemotherapy , " Yeh said .
Multiple imaging methods pinpoint location , performance of transplanted stem cells
Developing and refining non-invasive monitoring of the heart is important for cancer patients , said senior co-author Juri Gelovani , M.D. , Ph.D. , professor and chair of MD Anderson 's Department of Experimental Diagnostic Imaging .
" We need to develop methods for non-invasive monitoring by molecular - genetic and functional imaging of the fate of transplanted stem cells as they contribute regeneration of cardiac tissues and recovery of the heart 's contractile function " Gelovani said .
" We want to give the gift of sight to an otherwise very blind area of stem cell transplantation research . "
After tying off an artery to the heart to induce a heart attack in the mice , the team then injected the mouse CD34 + cells around the damaged area in the treatment cohort .
Before injection , a triple - fusion reporter gene was introduced via retrovirus into the CD34 + cells .
The triple - fusion reporter allows for visualization of the stem cells using three different imaging methods after injection into the mice .
This triple reporter vector was invented by Gelovani and optimized for stem cells by senior research scientist Brian Rabinovich , Ph.D. , of Experimental Diagnostic Imaging .
The tri-fusion reporter gene delivers green fluorescence protein for imaging in tissue or cell culture , firefly luciferase for bioluminescent imaging , and the HSV1 - tk gene , which is a reporter gene for positron emission tomography ( PET ) imaging .
All three are expressed by the CD34 + cells and their progeny in the mouse hearts and provide the means for long - term monitoring of their fate by repetitive , multi-modal , non-invasive imaging .
Researchers used bioluminescence imaging to study how long the injected stem cells survived in the heart .
PET / CT imaging coupled with magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , pinpointed the precise location of stem cells ' in the heart muscle .
MRI also was used to measure ejection fraction and to assess the efficacy of the stem cell therapeutic approach for improving cardiac contractile function .
This MRI technique relies on an innovative approach developed by co-author Jim Bankson , Ph.D. , assistant professor in MD Anderson 's Department of Imaging Physics , to match the MRI images to the motion caused by the beating heart , while associate professor Luc Bidaut , Ph.D. , had optimized methods to overlay the PET / CT and MR images .
Bioluminescence imaging works well in small animals because the distance between detectors and the photon - emitting cells is short , it is unlikely to work in larger animals or humans for a variety of reasons .
The PET / CT and MRI techniques used in the experiment are readily translatable into the clinic , Gelovani noted .
The team used a new PET imaging agent called [ 18 F ]
FEAU which , when acted upon by the HSV1 - tk reporter gene , entrapped this radio - labeled PET agent inside the transplanted cells , enabling their detection in the heart by PET / CT imaging .
Gelovani said his team is developing an investigational new drug protocol for a Phase I human clinical trial using [ 18 F ]
FEAU PET / CT imaging to monitor HSV1 - tk or hTK2 reporter gene - labeled stem cells after transplantation in human patients .

The event , though organized locally by Smoke ’s Poutinerie , was sanctioned by Major League Eating , which calls itself “ the World governing body of all stomach - centric sports . ”
MLE hosts the annual Nathan ’s hot dog eating contest on Coney Island that made Takeru Kobayashi , the Japanese guy who can eat fifty - three hot dogs in twelve minutes , a pop cultural semi-icon .
MLE oversees a stable of registered competitive eaters , who jockey for rank on an international leader board .
Since poutine is new to the sport , the Championship attracted a number of registrations from serious competitors .
Pre -event speculation had it that the winner would likely need to eat eight pounds of poutine .
It was rainy on the day of the Championship , so most of the MLE eaters that had come to Toronto to compete spent their downtime , before the competition , underneath the awning of a building near BMO Field with a big sign on top that said : FOOD .
Mike Landrich , from Fredonia , New York , and William Myers , from Allentown , Pennsylvania ―the forty - eighth and forty - first ranked competitive eaters in the world , respectively ―were chatting , sitting on some steps when we arrived .
Neither of them had tried poutine before .
“ Personally , I think this will be a little easier than some of the sandwich foods we do , ” said Myers , who is a big , pleasant guy with a goatee , and who works as a programmer and analyst when not eating competitively .
“ The hot dogs , for example , require a lot more chewing .
This , as long as you break it up a little bit , chew it a couple times — it ’ll be pretty much a capacity contest . ”
“ And this should be easier than just regular , straight fries , ” added Landrich .
The gravy , he said , would make it all easier to swallow .
Landrich and Myers had no illusions about their odds of winning .
They both knew who the favourite was .
“ It ’s gotta be Bertoletti , ” said Myers .
“ Yeah , Bertoletti , ” said Landrich .
Pat “ Deep Dish ” Bertoletti , a chef from Chicago ( most major - league eaters have day jobs , because the prize money is n’t enough to live on ) , was also hovering underneath the awning .
He is twenty - four , relatively slim by MLE standards ( meaning , he weighs less than two hundred pounds ) , and he sports a mohawk , which made him appear taller than everyone else .
Bertoletti has eaten forty - seven slices of pizza in ten minutes , and , with no hands , 9.17 pounds of blueberry pie in eight , to name just two of his eating accomplishments .
He ’s currently the fourth - ranked competitive eater on the MLE ’s ladder .
“ He ’s a machine , ” said Landrich .
The Championships were n’t open only to MLE competitors .
Smoke ’s had held a contest , in advance of the event , with the purpose of selecting a few locals to participate .
Ben Do , a University of Toronto Mississauga student whose campaign for an invitation to the Championship involved making videos of himself eating things like pizza and Trinidadian doubles very quickly , and starting a Facebook group for his supporters , was one of three amateurs to receive a spot at the table .
Do is tall , with an athlete ’s build and cropped , black hair .
When he arrived , a man in khakis and a white collared shirt stuck a clipboard in his hands .
There was a sheet of paper attached , covered in sternly worded paragraphs in very small font .
It was the standard MLE waiver , with warnings about the adverse effects of eating several days ’ worth of calories in a few minutes .
“ Usually I ’m on a pretty strict diet , ” said Do , who had never eaten competitively before , “ because I train for martial arts . ”
When the time came for the main event to begin , the competitors took their seats at a long table in front of the assembled press and a small crowd of onlookers , who were killing time before the Toronto FC versus New England game that was going to be getting underway at BMO stadium shortly ( some of them were eating poutine , which at this point in the day still seemed remotely appetizing ) .
Each competitor had a row of one - pound boxes of fries and curds before them , onto each of which a handler had just ladled eight ounces of brown gravy from a steel bucket .
Ben
Do put in some earbuds and a look of concentration came over his face .
Pat Bertoletti also had headphones on , and appeared to be psyching himself up .
A straw - hatted barker led the crowd in a countdown , and then it was on .
Bertoletti lunged for his fork and used it to bring a single bite of poutine to his mouth , before tossing the dainty utensil aside .
Within seconds , it was clear that bare hands would be the path to poutine - eating victory .
One competitor had brought a pair of latex gloves , which he ’d wisely put on beforehand .
Watching Bertoletti eat poutine was like watching a lion dismantle a gazelle on Animal Planet ―except on endless repeat , and in quadruple fast - forward ( and with hands , which lions would use if they could ) .
His technique was to grab a great handful of sopping fries and curds , then mash them into a kind of brown , potatoey ball , which he would then stuff into his mouth , chomp on aggressively , and swallow , while his hand went back to the box for the next bite .
Within minutes , one of the amateur participants had already spit up some of the contents of his stomach into a nearby trash bin , after which he left the table .
But Ben
Do turned out to be a true warrior .
His technique was n’t as efficient as Bertoletti’s , but he used his hands and paced himself .
The competition was ten minutes long .
By minute five , faces and beards were dripping with gravy .
The smell of curds and animal fat was so strong that it could almost have been chewed .
Ben
Do ’s eyes were red .
He was beginning to lose steam .
Bertoletti , meanwhile , barely slowed down .
By the end , he ’d eaten thirteen pounds of poutine , beating his nearest competitor ―Tim “ Gravy ” Brown , another strong favourite ―by two - and - a - half boxes .
His prize was $ 750 , which he told the Globe and Mail he was going to spend at a bar .
Ben
Do had eaten seven pounds , which put him ahead of several of the MLE eaters , though it was n’t enough to earn him a prize .
He put his hands behind his head and started breathing deeply , like a runner after a marathon .
As nauseating as it was to watch , the Poutine - Eating Championship is something about which Canada ’s gastronomes can justly be proud .
Why not ?
Poutine has seldom been taken more seriously .

Erickson 's census ' shotgun ' threat
CNN contributor and prominent Republican blogger Erick Erickson is threatening to pull out a " shotgun " to scare away census workers .
Erickson — the founder of the conservative blog RedState — said on his Macon , Ga. - area radio show Thursday that if a census worker carrying a longer American Community Survey form came by his house , he would " pull out my wife 's shotgun and see how that little ACS twerp likes being scared at the door . "
Advertisement
" They 're not going on my property .
They can't do that .
They do n't have the legal right , and yet they 're trying , " Erickson said , in a recording by the liberal media watchdog Media Matters .
" The servants are becoming the masters .
We are working for the government .
We are becoming enslaved by the government . "
On his blog , RedState , Erickson wrote Friday that he was being " misconstrued . "
" ACS Surveyors are getting belligerent , " he wrote , " and have showed up on people 's doorsteps to harass them and threaten jail .
I said if some ACS person showed up on my doorstep to try to arrest me for not wanting to tell the government how often I flush my toilet , I 'd get out my wife 's shotgun and get them off my property .
Naturally the left is out today saying I was on the air advocating killing census workers . "
Despite having a history of inflammatory rhetoric — he once called retired Supreme Court Justice David Souter a " goat f—ing child molester " —
Erickson was touted by CNN as an " agenda - setter " who is " in touch with the very people " the network hopes to reach when they signed him to provide commentary in March .
Asked about his controversial past statements Sunday on CNN's " Reliable Sources , " Erickson said that he has had to " grow up over time . "
" I 've definitely had to grow up and realize I am someone now on a national stage and a platform , and what I say and write affects not just me and my family , but others , " he said .
But on Thursday , Erickson demonstrated much of the same rhetorical flare with his anti-census rant that prompted liberal groups to blast CNN for hiring the conservative firebrand .
" The questionnaire asks how many people live with you , what their relationship is to you and their names , ages , genders and race .
Now that 's actually part of the census form , " he said .
" But the ACS delves more into that and wants to know where you work , what time you leave for work , how you get to work , how long it takes you to get to work , how many people travel with you .
It 's like a questionnaire a stalker might send you . "
" Scammers could be doing this , " he suggested .
" The Congress has empowered the Commerce Department to ask questions .
The Commerce Department has decided that if you do not answer questions , it 's going to find you , have you arrested and throw you in jail , " he added .
" This is crazy .
What gives the Commerce Department the right to ask me how often I flush my toilet ?
Or about going to work ?
I 'm not filling out this form . "
Other conservatives — notably Rep. Michele Bachmann ( R - Minn . ) — have been making a strong anti-census push , but it does not seem to be sticking .
According to a CNN / Opinion Research poll released Thursday , 83 percent of Americans do not think filling out the census is an invasion of privacy .
Mayor Pam Kaithern said the Salty Knits have brightened the dull landscape of early spring .
And the unknown identity of the knitters adds to the fun .
In a town " bursting with artists , " she said , " it could be just about anybody .
I think it 's better not to know . "
TOILET TRICK : Arrowtown 's Kate Gatonyi with her hero , Maceo , whose wet paws saved his owners from a fierce fire .
A cat has saved a Central Otago couple who were within a whisker of being engulfed by a " raging inferno " .
Maceo the cat woke his Arrowtown owners at 3 am on Wednesday by wetting his paws in the toilet bowl and walking on their faces .
Kate Gatonyi and partner Bevan Garland awoke to find a fire just three metres from their bedroom window .
A neighbour 's shed had caught fire and the flames were spreading to the couple 's garage and gas bottles .
Gatonyi said Maceo often played with water but had never put his feet in the toilet bowl .
He usually just meowed if he wanted to get attention at night , she said .
" The cat was putting his paws in the toilet bowl and then walking over our faces .
He did it about three times .
I was thinking , ` Why is he doing that ? '
That is what woke me up , " she said .
" I looked out the side of my eye and thought , ` What is all that colour out there ? '
I opened up my blinds and there was a raging inferno .
" It had nearly got to my fence .
The neighbour next door was wetting our fence , but it would have gone to the garage , the car , the gas bottles and our bedroom .
It was quite scary . "
Gatonyi praised the cat 's alarm - raising brilliance and said he would be rewarded .
" He 's a hero in my world , " she said .
" I think he was fantastic .
" He is going to get a lot of biscuits . "
Last month , the former Director of National Intelligence Michael McConnell boldly took to the Senate floor and the Washington Post 's editorial page to declare " The United States is fighting a cyber - war today , and we are losing . "
Thankfully for the American people , his company – the giant defense contractor Booz Allen Hamilton – has now landed the contract to build the Pentagon 's cyberwar control center .
For a measly $ 14.4 million in taxpayer money , the outfit will help build a new cyberwar bunker for the U.S. Cyber Command .
Additionally , Booz Allen Hamilton won another contract for $ 20 million to " foster collaboration among telecommunications researchers , University of Maryland faculty members and other academic institutions to improve secure networking and telecommunications and boost information assurance , " Washington Technology reports .
While that might sound like a lot of money to set up a mailing list and a wiki , please do n't be cynical .
Undoubtedly , McConnell 's crack team of consultants are providing the researchers with around - the - clock bodyguards and state - of - the - art bullet - proof monitors .
Meanwhile , we urge U.S. netizens to refrain from un-patriotic musings that McConnell intentionally uses fear and exaggerated rhetoric to land these kinds of contracts for his company and instead , be vigilant and keep their eyes out for signs of Chinese hackers ( one telltale sign is a " Made in China " label on the bottom of your laptop ) .
Otherwise you might soon find yourself facing a Red Screen of Death ( RSOD ) , making you just one more casualty in this tragic cyberwar we Americans are all bravely enduring as one nation united .

Although more than a bit late getting posted here , you should know about the accomplishments of the p2k9 Ports Hackathon .
Sure , it might look like a party , but when you get a bunch of people together with similar ideas of having fun porting programs , amazing amounts of supposed " work " gets done .
p2k9 : Ports hackathonOct 9 - 16 , 2009 Budapest , Hungary14 developers
Edd Barrett ( edd@ ) - a.k.a.
" Edd the Vagabond "
Irrational Fear of Snakes ?
After finding Robert , I set up in the hackroom and started working on some ports I had hanging around in my tree as well as some new stuff :
The much needed x11 / mplayer update .
print / texlive 2009 .
TeX Works update ( to a release ) .
textproc / xpdf security fix .
Javascript support for www / elinks
games / openttd update .
net / ziproxy .
audio / pms update .
Qt-creator .
net / flickcurl update .
games / snipe2d Orbital Eunuchs Sniper
A brief look at mixxx , devel / cmake and audio / ncmpc .
Some of this I did not fully complete .
The TeX Live work was based upon a nightly snap , as it has not yet been released .
The good news is that it requires far fewer patches than before and should be a bit easier to integrate .
landry@ , edd@
Myself and espie@ are still working in QT - creator , as it has various issues .
Hopefully we can nail that soon .
On the Sunday naddy@ created my CVS account !
My first commit was shortly after .
( Thanks naddy ! )
In the evenings we usually went to a restaurant for food and beer .
Early in the week we had a great curry , then later in the week we went to the legendary Sir Lancelot 's for a medieval feast .
One afternoon we slacked at the spa for a few hours and got wrinkly .
The hackathon was both productive and fun .
I would like to take the opportunity to thank the project for allowing the event to happen , Robert for planning everything and also the other porters for having me there .
Thanks
Matthias Kilian ( kili@ )
Update lang / guile and depending ports , mainly to be able to update print / lilypond .
After some initial attempts earlier this year , where okan@ and me started to test - build all the depending ports and looking at the results of make regress , jasper@ helped a lot some weeks ago by putting the diffs into a bulk build .
I did n't want to commit it before p2k9 , though , because of possible breakage .
Only at an event like this hackathon you 're able to find and fix problems quickly .
Update print / poppler , and help edd@ to let his latest work on texlive to build with it ( it did build with poppler - 0.10 , but poppler - 0.12 broke it , so I fixed it ) .
After edd@ committed the update of xpdf , I started to merge the patches into ports based on or including xpdf sources , like kdegraphics ( x11/kde/graphics3 ) , texlive ( the version currently on ports ) and poppler .
Some older xpdf changes went also in .
The texlive are n't committed yet , and I 'm also working on merging the patches into the stable branch .
The `traditional ' print / ghostscript update ( only sent to ports@ but not yet committed , because I want to get people a chance to test it ) .
Some work on updating net / kismet to the latest version .
This is still work in progress , but I think it will be finished early enough for 4.7 .
Last but not least , I did some work on getting lang / ghc back into shape .
It 's still not bootstrappable from scratch , but I think I got a little bit closer .
Well , no thrilling non-ports stories from me , except you want to read a big lament about travelling from Braunschweig to Budapest and back by train ;-)
Nicholas Marriott ( nicm@ )
jasper , aja , landry , nicm I was working on tmux , mainly on cleaning up some longstanding bugs , queued diffs or todo items rather than adding any huge features .
Of the 39 tmux commits , these were the most significant :
Added simple job scheduling so that when you run tmux itself from inside ( such as from # ( ) in status - left ) it does n't hang and so that commands are run only every status - interval rather than every redraw .
Finished off and committed a diff to add " grouped sessions " , allowing a session to share windows but have an independent current window and options , this is similar behaviour to " screen - x " and has been much requested .
Stop tmux outputting a hard newline at the end of every line even if it wrapped at the screen edge .
Instead , let the terminal wrap naturally , allowing xterm mouse selection to correctly find the end of the line .
This was another MUCH requested fix , but was quite difficult and frustrating to get right - without p2k9 I probably would n't have been able to spend the time it needed .
A " mouse - select - pane " option to allow the active pane to be chosen by clicking on it with the mouse .
Suggested before by someone but brought up again at p2k9 by sthen@ .
Committed the diff for a " pipe - pane " command to send any output in a pane to a command .
Requested by espie@ .
Scroll lines into the history even when the scroll region does n't cover the whole screen , this makes ircII users like naddy@ happy .
Permit attributes to be turned off in # [ ] by prefixing " no " , such as " noblink " .
Use relative cursor movement when the terminal supports it .
This makes things a bit more efficient , and shook out a number of redraw bugs .
Committed a diff a user submitted extending the lock timer to work independently for individual sessions .
Lots of code cleanup , bug hunting , and some work on making tmux and vttest play more nicely together .
And beer .
I also sent off some minor fixes for some other areas , made a couple of trivial ports changes .
Christian Weisgerber ( naddy@ )
Sunshine Girl Reminded by some recent questions on misc@ , I finally sat down and fixed luit ( 1 ) , which is not a port but part of our X11 installation .
By itself , xterm ( 1 ) only supports the ISO 8859 - 1 and UTF - 8 character encodings .
For other encodings required to write many languages , such as ISO 8859 - 2 for Czech or KOI8 - R for Russian , xterm will run in UTF - 8 mode and spawn luit ( 1 ) as a wrapper that translates from and to the respective encoding .
luit lacked proper support to allocate a pseudo - TTY on OpenBSD and would barely run , issuing a scary message : " Warning : could not change ownership of tty -- pty is insecure ! " .
I fixed this by adding proper support for openpty ( 3 ) , so you can now safely use xterm with a large number of traditional character encodings .
If you had to learn French as a foreign language , you are painfully aware that there are a few hundred irregular verbs with unpredicatble stem changes in the many inflectional forms .
The new education / verbiste port can demonstrate the conjugation of even the most tricky French verbs .
And if you come across a strange verb form in a text , verbiste can also tell you which tense / mood / person of which verb (s ) you are looking at , so you know what to look up in a dictionary .
Larger port updates I committed at p2k9 were audio / mpeg123 , which now uses optimized assembly code on more platforms , and in particular graphics / jpeg v7 .
A lot of ports directly or indirectly depend on jpeg , so I needed to run a full bulk build , but happily only two ports required special fixes .
phessler@ suggested that it would be nice if audio / openal , a 3D audio API used by a number of games , supported our native sndio audio interface instead of having to resort to OSS emulation .
As usual , there was no documentation on the internal API , so I had to spend a silly amount of time reading the backends for other operating systems before I felt confident to write what turned out to be a surprisingly simple sndio backend .
This still requires some testing before it can be committed .
And , as usual , I also took the opportunity to commit a number of minor maintenance updates and bug fixes too boring to list in detail .
Marc Espie ( espie@ )
Florent
There was a student from 1st year Epitech , Florent Tribouilloy , whom I invited , and who did tasks such as helping Antoine on a editors / subtitleeditor , update and Landry on some x11 / xfce4 / terminal , update .
He 's been learning quite a few ropes of the ports tree .
Before that , I assigned him to work on some internal school project : write a specific bsd.rd that can pass their rather unusual proxy system ( which he did ) so that people at epita / epitech can install OpenBSD over the network without having first to download all the sets using another OS .
I 've also asked him to have a look at writing a BSD - licenced devel / cflow based on the lint parser ... no need to reinvent the wheel , since we already have a C language parser in the tree .
This might help in finding horrible code in lint , to boot ;-)
As far as I 'm concerned , I mostly did work on pkg_add .
Most of the changes do n't have a lot of user impact , so far .
I 'm cleaning up the code to allow for two things :
merging the update system with the dependency solver .
So that updates will eventually happen " on the fly " , instead of computing all updates first , and doing them later .
This allows me to be more correct in the dependency order , also to do partial updates correctly , and to install new packages while updating their dependencies .
If you 're in a hurry , this means you will be able to start an update and have it do stuff quickly , instead of waiting forever until it has scanned your whole list of packages .
I 've had this in my tree for ages , but there were bugs to fix .
I had to clean up dependency handling an to add a new " tracker " object that knows about all pending updates just so that the code does n't get any messier .
merged updatesets .
That is , updating two or three packages at once , in cases where it 's necessary : tight dependencies ( mysql- client / server ) , files moving from package to package ( kdelibs / kdebase ) , or even dependency reversal ( somewhere in cairo / pango a few releases back ) .
Most of the infrastructure is now there .
What 's left to do is to recognize those situations , and check that an updateset with newer > 1 works .
This is fairly important for correctness , since some update scenarios currently do cheat and work by accident .
The user - visible changes : stems with flavors , ala screen -- or star -- static .
Actually trivial to do .
- z/-l option , to duplicate an install ( more or less ) quickly .
Best effort so far .
Will work much better once the " update - on - the - fly " thingy works .
cosmetic clean - ups of install messages : less lines during updates .
Restoring dependency handling .
Showing signed packages in a cleaner way .
recognizing some cases where repositories do n't have packages ( wrong path ) that we did n't get so far .
I also worked on ports a bit , mostly with Edd , who 's trying to make progress on cmake ( which is a tough issue ) , and on qt-creator , for which you should expect a port sometime in the near future : the actual issue is just a question of path to the plugins , which is recorded nowhere except on linux .
There was also a pending patch from Nicm that I validated over p2k9 : the pipe - pane command , which can be used with a variation of portslogger to log all activity in a tmux window that 's related to the ports tree .
Very cool .
I was happy to meet edd , phessler , and nicm .
And of course , to see again the usual band of suspects .
Landry Breuil ( landry@ )
cmixer audio/ cmixer , a quick hack written in perl - curses by yours truly to display a console mixer , or games / jbrickshooter , a stupid reflexion game which made me dreaming of moving coloured blocks , ajacoutot@ can witness it 's addictive ( and stupid ) ..
i fixed some x11/ gtk+2 , update breakage , mainly in www / kazehakaze , ( which required some awful hackery with axe and rocketlaunchers , some parts of this code are really horrible and made me produce a lot of grumblings and rants ) .
I also updated www / webkit , to a more recent version , now that we have a recent devel / libsoup , and updated various x11 / xfce , components ( that 's a background task ) .
And the two most important items : i updated the whole graphics / clutter stack , which was needed for a geo / libchamplain ( the openstreetmap client library ) update , and imported geo / emerillon ( a Gtk+ Openstreetmap viewer ) and it's dependencies net / librest and devel / ethos ( a plugin framework for Gtk+2 / Glib apps ) .
i imported multimedia / moovida ( previously known as Elisa media center ) , a nice standalone HTPC software written in python heavily using GL for its GUI and multimedia / gstreamer for the media part .
Thou Shalt Not Pass !
multimedia / coherence and audio / py - tagpy , and worked on net / libmms support in gstreamer .
devel / py-cssutils gave me some work too , but the hardest part was definitely graphics / pigment and graphics / py - pigment , which required some help from oga , guenther and kurt to understand how py - pigment & python were supposed to load and use libGL .
I spent two days on it , but finally figured out a " clever " workaround , and was able to successfully run it on my atom netbook with decent performance .
I had a quick ( one night ) look too at XBMC , another HTPC / Media player software , and there 's a huge amount of work before having this beast running on OpenBSD ... maybe someday ; it 's a huge pile ( 160 Mb tarball ) of awful code from various sources , linking tons of homemade patched copies of ffmpeg , libdvd * & various video libs , an embedded ms - windows dll virtual loader , a homemade VFS layer , and tons of linux / osx / windows - only functions .
A good looking app for sure , but not what i'd call portable to OpenBSD ... a make clean in the wrong dir ruined my patching efforts , so it 's pushed for another day :)
And most importantly , i enjoyed sharing some good french & dutch cheese and homemade mirabelle with the porters crew , eating to death at sir lancelot , trofea or in other really awsum ' restaurants serving crazy liver - based meals .. that was a really cool edition , way too short !
Paul Irofti ( pirofti@ )
take over landisk package builds from robert
update about 40 - 50 ruby outdated ports ( including www / ruby - rails and friends )
work on bringing math / octave up to date ( this is still WIP but all the major parts were done during c2k9 )
do some OT stuff like ACPI suspend / resume work and investigation ( a big patch was commited during p2k9 actually )
bring in some new ports like pdq and other ruby utilities
plus lots of small stuff that I do n't remember at the moment FUN : ( i.e. Other FUN ) drink beer and toss ideas at night
revisit pubs from the last hackathon
cool restaurants like the indian one we went to last year
Sir Lancelot
Spa ( I did n't attend , but others went )
I spent the weekend after p2k9 with my girlfriend visiting the old center and some of the other interesting parts of Budapest , going to the spa , going to the dead baby heads pub and eating at some of the nice restaurants I found during the hackathon
Steven Mestdagh ( steven@ )
The Plate devel / libtool .
Code cleaning , and separation into smaller , more understandable pieces , as well as fixing a few corner cases .
Right after p2k9 , I was happy to see that it can now finally complete a build of xenocara .
It is also able to build some more other ports correctly .
I need to do some more testing with it , and if the result is good enough , we can enable it for general use .
The new libtool allows us to more easily build programs or libraries even when other versions are installed on the system , and will also speed up ports bulk builds ( about 20 % of the ports tree uses libtool , many of which are big ports ) , so it helps to reduce the time needed to build a package snapshot .
I also spent some time helping pirofti@ with getting math / octave to build ; the gfortran compiler and associated fortran libraries are needed there , and this required some fixes in the lang / gcc / 4.2 packages .
Some more minor things , helping out new people a bit , and the activities ...
I think we finished the plate this time :)
Jasper Lievisse Adriaanse ( jasper@ )
jasper landry nicm p2k9 had a pretty clear goal for Antoine and myself ; update our x11 / gnome ports to their 2.28.x release .
Pretty early on I made the " mistake " of queuing some fine Swedish cultural gems ... and pretty soon thereafter everyone was familiar with Guenther 's tralala and ding - ding - dong .
Oh , and having a beamer in the hacking room did n't really help either .
Some time before p2k9 major updates to devel / glib2 and x11/ gtk+2 had already been committed , which allowed us to really focus on GNOME .
Instead of having to worry about those important libraries too .
We set off right from the beginning at updating and pretty soon we ran into " old friends " .
Being HAL , PolicyKit and GStreamer .
Stuart is doing some great groundwork which will eventually allow us to update GStreamer .
He 'll elaborate on that though .
As it turned out , even with two people hacking on GNOME for one week , almost 24 hours a day , we still were n't able to finish all the things we wanted to .
There are some regressions that we noticed , but we continue to work on / debug it .
Besides the work on GNOME I also did some work on devel / libffi , multimedia / gstreamer , net / farsight ( audio / video conferencing ) and general tweaking on dozens of other ports .
Five of us had decided to go for some serious and well deserved slacking after p2k9 , and on Friday we headed to Hévíz .
Where we slept , swam and drank to prevent post - hackathon burn - out ...
As was written on ports@ we would appreciate your testing and feedback !
And thanks again to Robert for organizing yet another superb edition of the ports hackathon in Budapest .
Stuart Henderson ( sthen@ )
devel / flex which is needed in order to update various ports ( including gstreamer , which itself blocks many other port updates ) .
My initial aim was to update the version in base and started on that basis ( beinning with a diff from millert@ and working towards updating the manual from the info pages ) while running a bulk package build .
But after looking over the failure logs , it does n't seem quite ready to make it the only version in the system , so I 've imported it as a port for now .
And of course we had the usual mix of awesome music , and a really nice time in Budapest ( and then a few of us stayed the following weekend near the lake in Hévíz for some much - needed recovery ) .
Due to slacking on the part of the undeadly editors , the article lags behind reality a bit , so some of the changes described here have been committed a long time ago .
None the less , it 's always nice to see work and fun behind the `sudo pkg_add whatever` magic .
EDIT : And by popular demand ...

And another one
EDIT2 : sthen wants MORE !
Hopefully the last
NOTE : I am the one responsible for putting embedded youtube files on undeadly , and there have been more than a few questions about it , particularly regarding Adobe / MacroMedia shockwave .
First of all , the actual videos are a running joke with some of the devs , and even the act of embedding youtube videos on undeadly is also a bit of a joke , but most importantly , you should already know how to handle video sites and formats with OpenBSD .
If not , then send me hate mail until I write an article explaining how to deal with it .
Now please excuse me while I go watch sthen 's lattest addition , and then promptly go running off into the weeds , screaming .

Editor ’s note : Because of an error , Chris Hedges ’ April 25 column used part of a sentence that appeared in a recent article by Christopher Ketcham in GOOD magazine and on its website .
Truthdig acknowledges Ketcham ’s work and regrets the failure to properly attribute the wording to him .
Ketcham is credited in the revised column below .
Acts of rebellion which promote moral and political change must be nonviolent .
And one of the most potent nonviolent alternatives in the country , which defies the corporate state and calls for an end to imperial wars , is the secessionist movement bubbling up in some two dozen states including Vermont , Texas , Alaska and Hawaii .
These movements do not always embrace liberal values .
Most of the groups in the South champion a “ neo- Confederacy ” and are often exclusively male and white .
Secessionists , who call for statewide referendums to secede , do not advocate the use of force .
It is unclear , however , if some will turn to force if the federal structure ever denies them independence .
These groups at least grasp that the old divisions between liberals and conservatives are obsolete and meaningless .
They understand that corporations have carried out a coup d’état .
They recognize that our permanent war economy and costly and futile imperial wars are unsustainable and they demand that we take popular action to prevent citizens from being further impoverished and robbed by Wall Street speculators and corporations .
“ The defining characteristic of the Second Vermont Republic is that there are two enemies , the United States government and corporate America , ” Thomas Naylor , who founded Vermont ’s secessionist movement , told me when I reached him by phone at his home 10 miles south of Burlington .
“ One owns the other one .
We are not like the tea party .
The underlying premise of the tea party movement is that the system is fixable . ”
As reported by Christopher Ketcham in a recent issue of GOOD magazine , Naylor points to the nation ’s decline .
The secessionist leader notes , in Ketcham ’s words , “ Of all the western democracies , the United States stands near dead last in voter turnout , last in health care , last in education , highest in homicide rates , mortality , STDs among juveniles , youth pregnancy , abortion , and divorce . … ”
The nation , he says grimly , has trillions in deficits it can never repay , is beset by staggering income disparities , has destroyed its manufacturing base and is the planet ’s most egregious polluter and greediest consumer of fossil fuels .
With some 40 million Americans living in poverty , tens of millions more in a category called “ near poverty ” and a permanent underclass trapped by a real unemployment rate of 17 percent , there is ample tinder for internal combustion .
If we do not undertake a dramatic reversal soon , he asserts , the country and the global environment will implode with catastrophic consequences .
The secessionist movement is gaining ground in several states , especially Texas , where elected officials increasingly have to contend with secessionist sentiments .
“ Our membership has grown tremendously since the bailouts , since the tail end of the Bush administration , ” said Daniel Miller , the leader of the Texas Nationalist Movement , when I spoke with him by telephone from his home in the small town of Nederland , Texas .
“ There is a feeling in Texas that we are being spent into oblivion .
We are operating as the cash cow for the states that cannot manage their budgets .
With this Congress , Texas has been squarely in their cross hairs , from cap and trade to the alien transfer and exit program .
So many legislative pieces coming down the pike are offensive to people here in Texas .
The sentiment for independence here is very high .
The sentiment inside the Legislature and state capital is one of guarded optimism .
There are scores of folks within state government who are supportive of what we are doing , although there is a need to see the public support in a more tangible way .
This is why we launched our Let Texas Decide petition drive .
We intend to deliver over a million signatures on the opening day of the [ state legislative ] session on Jan. 11 , 2011 . ”
Miller , like Naylor , expects many in the tea party to migrate to secessionist movements once they realize that they cannot alter the structure or power of the corporate state through electoral politics .
Polls in Texas show the secessionists have support from about 35 percent of the state ’s population , and Vermont is not far behind .
Naylor , who taught economics at Duke University for 30 years , is , along with Kirkpatrick Sale and Donald Livingston , one of the intellectual godfathers of the secessionist movement .
His writing can be found on The Second Vermont Republic website , on the website Secession News and in postings on the Middlebury Institute website .
Naylor first proposed secession in his 1997 book “ Downsizing the USA . ”
He comes out of the “ small is beautiful ” movement , as does Sale .
Naylor lives with his wife in the Vermont village of Charlotte .
The Second Vermont Republic arose from the statewide anti-war protests in 2003 .
It embraces a left - wing populism that makes it unique among the national movements , which usually veer more toward Ron Paul libertarianism .
The Vermont movement , like the Texas and Alaska movements , is well organized .
It has a bimonthly newspaper called The Vermont Commons , which champions sustainable agriculture and energy supplies based on wind and water , and calls for locally owned banks which will open lines of credit to their communities .
Dennis Steele , who is campaigning for governor as a secessionist , runs Radio Free Vermont , which gives a venue to Vermont musicians and groups as well as being a voice of the movement .
Vermont , like Texas , was an independent republic , but on March 4 , 1791 , voted to enter the union .
Supporters of the Second Vermont Republic commemorate the anniversary by holding a mock funeral procession through the state capital , Montpelier , with a casket marked “ Vermont . ”
Secessionist candidates in Vermont are currently running for governor , lieutenant governor , eight Senate seats and two House seats .
“ The movement , at its core , is anti-authoritarian , ” said Sale , who works closely with Naylor and spoke with me from his home in Charleston , S.C.
“ It includes those who are libertarians and those who are on the anarchic community side .
In traditional terms these people are left and right , but they have come very close together in their anti-authoritarianism .
Left and right no longer have meaning . ”
The movement correctly views the corporate state as a force that has so corrupted the economy , as well as the electoral and judicial process , that it cannot be defeated through traditional routes .
It also knows that the corporate state , which looks at the natural world and human beings as commodities to be exploited until exhaustion or collapse occurs , is rapidly cannibalizing the nation and pushing the planet toward irrevocable crisis .
And it argues that the corporate state can be dismantled only through radical forms of nonviolent revolt and the dissolution of the United States .
As an act of revolt it has many attributes .
“ The only way we will ever stop these wars is when we stop paying for them , ” Naylor told me .
“ Vermont contributes about $ 1.5 billion to the Pentagon ’s budget .
Do we want to keep supporting these wars ?
If not , let ’s pull out .
We have two objectives .
The first is returning Vermont to its status as an independent republic .
The second is the peaceful dissolution of the empire .
I see these as being mutually complementary . ”
“ The U.S. government has lost its moral authority , ” he went on .
“ It is corrupt to the core .
It is owned , operated and controlled by Wall Street and corporate America .
Its foreign policy is controlled by the Israeli lobby .
It is unsustainable economically , socially , morally , militarily and environmentally .
It is ungovernable and therefore unfixable .
The question is , do you go down with the Titanic or do you seek other options ? ”
The leaders of the movement concede that sentiment still outstrips organization .
There has not been a large proliferation of new groups , and a few old groups have folded because of a lack of leadership and support .
But they insist that an increasing number of Americans are receptive to their ideas .
“ The number of groups has not grown as I hoped it would when I started having congresses , ” said Sale , who addresses groups around the country .
“ But the number of people , of individuals , of websites and the number of libertarians who have come around has grown leaps and bounds .
Many of those who were disappointed by the treatment of Ron Paul have come to the conclusion that they cannot have a Libertarian Party or a libertarian Republican .
They are beginning to talk about secession . ”
“ Secessionists have to be very careful not to be militaristic , ” Sale warned .
“ This can not be won by the gun .
You can be emphatic in your secessionism , but it wo n’t happen by carrying guns .
I do n’t know what the tea party people think they are going to accomplish with guns .
I guess it is a statement against the federal government and the fear that Obama is about to have gun control .
It appears to be an assertion of individual rights .
But the tea party people have not yet understood how they are going to get their view across .
They still believe they can elect people , either Republicans or declared conservatives , to office in Washington and have an effect , as if you can escape the culture of Washington and the characteristics of government that has only gotten bigger and will only continue to get bigger .
Electing people to the House and Senate is not going to change the characteristics of the system . ”
The most pressing problem is that the movement harbors within its ranks Southern secessionists who wrap themselves in the Confederate flag , begin their meetings singing Dixie and celebrate the slave culture of the antebellum South .
Secessionist groups such as the Southern National Congress and the more radical League of the South , which the Southern Poverty Law Center has labeled a “ racist hate group , ” openly embrace a return to uncontested white , male power .
And this aspect of the movement deeply disturbs leaders such as Naylor , Sale and Miller .
What all these movements grasp , however , is that the American empire is over .
It can not be sustained .
They understand that we must disengage peacefully , learn to speak with a new humility and live with a new simplicity , or see an economic collapse that could trigger a perverted Christian fascism , a ruthless police state and internecine violence .
“ There are three or four possible scenarios that will bring down the empire , ” Naylor said .
“ One possibility is a war with Iran .
Another will see the Chinese pull the plug on Treasury bills .
Even if these do not happen , the infrastructure of the country is decaying .
This is a slower process .
And they do not have the economy fixed .
It is smoke and mirrors .
This is why the price of gold is so high .
The economy and the inability to stop the wars will alone be enough to bring us down .
There is no escape now from our imperial overstretch . ”
Matt Dobson , a forecaster for MeteoGroup , the weather division of the Press Association , said : " The concern is that as well as the eruption , the jet stream passing through Iceland is passing in a south easterly direction , which will bring ash to the north of Scotland and Denmark and Norway .
But it is impossible to say how much ash will come down .
We 've been covering the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement ( ACTA ) for two years now , and in that entire 24 month period no official text of the agreement has been released .
Remarkable , really , given the intense scrutiny , but there you have it .
Today , that all changed as the countries behind ACTA finally released a consolidated draft text ( PDF ) of the agreement .
Though billed as a " trade agreement " about " counterfeiting , " ACTA is much more than that : it 's an intellectual property treaty in disguise .
New to this draft is an option , clearly targeting European law , that would explicitly allow Internet disconnections
Tucked inside the draft are provisions that will prevent people from bypassing digital locks on the items they buy , that will force ISPs to shoulder more of the burden in the fight against online piracy , and that bring US - style " notice - and - takedown " rules to the world .
Well , not to the world , exactly .
ACTA is more like a select club of countries : Australia , Canada , the European Union countries , Japan , Korea , Mexico , Morocco , New Zealand , Singapore , Switzerland and the United States of America .
But the treaty it develops is really just the next rung on a ladder stretching back to 1886 , and it will certainly be wielded like a weapon on the rest of the world in the future .
The text is not final — that is due to happen later this year — so if you want to see changes made , the time to act is now .
After a year of partial leaks and finally complete leaks , ACTA 's basic outlines are familiar .
We 'll start our ACTA deep dive with an overview of the key provisions , especially as they relate to the Internet .
Stick around afterwards to understand how and why we have ACTA at all , some likely effects of the treaty , and thoughts on the negotiating endgame .
A quick word of thanks to the negotiators who finally heard the dull but growing roar of a disenchanted public and released the ACTA text : it 's too late to qualify as " transparency , " exactly , but it does inaugurate a new stage and a new start .
It 's now time for the real arguments to begin .
The EU has already made its case that ACTA wo n't affect ordinary citizens .
And it takes particular aim at the groups which have loudly condemned ACTA : " The negotiation draft shows that specific concerns , raised in particular by the civil society , are unfounded .
No party in the ACTA negotiation is proposing that governments should introduce a compulsory ' 3 strikes ' or ' gradual response ' rule to fight copyright infringements and internet piracy .
Similarly , ACTA will not hamper access to generic medicines . "
Our own investigation shows that several of the most controversial provisions have been tweaked for the better , though problems remain .
Let 's take a look .
ISP immunity / three strikes
Under ACTA , ISPs are protected from copyright lawsuits as long as they have no direct responsibility for infringement .
If infringement merely happens over their networks , the infringers are responsible but the ISPs are not .
This provision mirrors existing US and European law .
Two key points need to be made here , however .
First , the entire ISP safe harbor is conditioned on the ISP " adopting and reasonably implementing a policy to address the unauthorized storage or transmission of materials protected by copyright . "
( This is much like existing US law . )
An earlier footnote found in a leaked draft provided a single example of such a policy : " Providing for termination in appropriate circumstances of subscriptions and accounts in the service provider 's system or network of repeat infringers . "
In other words , some variation of " three strikes . "
That footnote is now gone from the text entirely .
While the ACTA draft adopts the best part of the DMCA ( copyright " safe harbors " ) , it also adopts the worst : making it illegal to bypass DRM locks .
New to this draft is an option , clearly targeting European law , that would explicitly allow Internet disconnections .
Countries will be allowed to force ISPs to " terminate or prevent an infringement " and they can pass laws " governing the removal or disabling of access to information .
So , basically , Internet disconnection and website blocking .
The option also allows rightsholders to " expeditiously obtain from that provider information on the identity of the relevant subscriber " and it encourages countries to " promote the development of mutually supportive relationships between online service providers and right holders . "
This option has not been approved by all ACTA members .
The ACTA draft also makes clear that governments cannot mandate Internet filtering or affirmative action to seek out infringers .
Second , the ISP immunity is conditioned on the existence of " takedown " process .
In the US , this is the ( in ) famous " DMCA takedown " dance that starts with a letter from a rightsholder .
Once received , an ISP or Web storage site ( think YouTube ) must take down the content listed in order to maintain its immunity , but may repost it if the uploader responds with a " counter - notification " asserting that no infringement has taken place .
After this , if the rightsholder wants to pursue the matter , it can take the uploader to court .
This will strongly affect countries like Canada , which have no such system .
Anti-circumvention / DRM
While the ACTA draft adopts the best part of the DMCA ( copyright " safe harbors " ) , it also adopts the worst : making it illegal to bypass DRM locks .
ACTA would ban " the unauthorized circumvention of an effective technological measure . "
It also bans circumvention devices , even those with a " limited commercially significant purpose . "
Countries can set limits to the ban , but only insofar as they do not " impair the adequacy of legal protection of those measures . "
This is ambiguous , but allowing circumvention in cases where the final use is fair would appear to be outlawed .
Fortunately , a new option in this section would allow countries much greater freedom .
The option says that countries " may provide for measures which would safeguard the benefit of certain exceptions and limitations to copyright and related rights , in accordance with its legislation . "
i Pod - scanning border guards ?
Early ACTA commentators often complained that the agreement might give customs officials the right to rifle through your bags and search your iPod , confiscating it if they determined that it contained any infringing songs .
Border guards might become copyright cops , turning out the bags of anyone who has visited China , say , to see if they might be bringing home any illicit copies of movies or software .
This was always a strange idea ; ACTA 's backers are hunting bigger game than iPods .
The draft text contains a " de minimis " provision that allows countries to exclude from ACTA enforcement " Small quantities of goods of a noncommercial nature contained in travelers ' personal luggage . "
The real copyright cops
ACTA contains " ex officio " language that allows customs officials and border agents to hold infringing shipments of goods without needing a rightsholder to complain first .
Several options are still being considered in the draft , but all give the authorities the right to " act upon their own initiative " in releasing suspected goods at customs checkpoints .
Camcording rips
Think twice about camcording a movie off the big screen .
ACTA now requires all signatories to make this practice a criminal act , not merely a civil matter .
The draft does note that " at least one delegation has asked for the deletion " of this section , though , so it may be an easy target for removal before the final version .
Imminent infringement
Several sections of the ACTA draft show that rightsholders can obtain an injunction just by showing that infringement is " imminent , " even if it has n't happened yet .
P2P without financial gain
ACTA requires criminal penalties against " willful copyright infringement " when done " on a commercial scale . "
Early drafts explicitly mentioned online piracy , and that still seems to be in view .
Though this section remains under negotiation , the draft shows that this may apply to infringements " that have no direct or indirect motivation of financial gain . "
In other words , P2P distribution , where this exact issue of financial gain has come up in numerous court cases .
Proportionate penalties
At least one enterprising ACTA country has managed to insert this interesting line into the section on " enforcement procedures in the digital environment " :
" Those measures , procedures , and remedies shall also be fair and proportionate . "
A dig at Internet disconnections and three strikes remedies , which are often criticized on these grounds ?
Who knows — and it 's still under debate .
Now : how did we get here ?

AS ECONOMISTS MARK UP their estimates of the first quarter 's economic growth , the least relevant question for investors is what number the Commerce Department will publish Friday for gross domestic product .
Three percent ?
Four percent ?
Vastly more important is whether rebound of the last two quarters is sustainable , given certain contractionary changes in fiscal and monetary policy , perhaps starting late this year and certainly in 2011 .
As the tax law currently stands , the Bush tax cuts are due to expire ( or " sunset " in the semi-literate usage of Washington bureaucrats who never saw a noun they did n't want to use as a verb ) at the end of the year .
That would mean all joint filers with incomes over $ 67,900 would see tax hikes , with the top bracket returning to 39.6 % .
The investor - friendly 15 % top rate on dividends and capital gains also will end ; dividends will revert to being taxed at ordinary - income rates while cap gains levies return to 20 % under current law .
The Obama administration proposes limiting the increases on earned income to the two top brackets , taxing dividends and cap gains at 20 % , while proposing limiting deductions , such as for mortgage interest and charitable deductions , for those in the highest brackets .
These all would require Congressional approval , however , which is by no means certain .
If Congress fails to act , Citigroup economists Steven C. Wieting and Peter D'Antonio estimate the tax hikes would take a huge , 2 % bite out of 2011 GDP .
For that reason , they look for something less draconian , close to what the White House proposes , to pass Congress , resulting in a 1 % hit to GDP .
But they do not expect these tax hikes to derail the recovery .
For one thing , tax revenues will rise from an increase in employment and income , an outcome earnestly desired all around .
Moreover , just as tax and interest - rate cuts of 2007 and 2008 did n't prevent the worst recession since the Great Depression , neither will the coming tax and rate hikes stop the recovery , the economists contend .
But , Wieting and D'Antonio also acknowledge that while the one - shot tax rebates of 2001 and 2003 had minimal stimulative effect , " an argument can be made that the ' permanent ' income - tax - rate reductions that followed in 2003 more lastingly swayed expectations . "
In other words , there are taxes and there are taxes .
Short - term changes in taxes and spending have limited , transitory effects on economic activity while permanent changes affect how people and businesses work , save and invest to create real wealth .
Among Milton Friedman 's greatest contribution to economics was his Permanent Income Hypothesis , which found that people , by and large , were n't drunken sailors .
Their spending depends on their long - term income prospects , so a one - shot boost has little impact on the economy .
Conversely , the coming tax hikes are permanent and are likely to have lasting effects .
Even if the hikes are confined to couples making over $ 250,000 , who comprise just 5 % of the population , this cohort accounts for 30 % of personal income , Wieting and D'Antonio point out .
" Also note that the highest income brackets represent a preponderance of small businesses , and account for a disproportionably large share of spending .
So , sharply raising tax rates in the top brackets should have a quite measurable , large effect on the economy , far in excess of the population share .
This then affects employment and income more broadly , " they write .
As for the impact from the increases on taxes on capital , the question is how negative they will be .
There 's no telling , given that nobody knows what future taxes on dividends and capital gains are likely to be .
That uncertainty alone has a cost , the Citi economists say .
The worst case -- dividends taxed as high as 39.6 % and a 3.8 % additional Medicare tax on top earners starting in 2012 -- would reduce the present value of the U.S. stock market by 10 % - 15 % , they estimate .
None of this takes into account the impact of monetary policy .
As the Federal Open Market Committee gathers for a two - day meeting that will break up Wednesday , the panel will mull eventual increases in its 0 - 0.25 % federal - funds rate target and , perhaps more importantly , when to reverse its " quantitative easing " -- the $ 1.75 trillion in purchases of long - term Treasuries , U.S. agency securities and agency mortgage - backed securities .
QE arguably has provided the main impulse for the rebound in the capital and equity markets , but it has failed to fuel an expansion in money and credit .
To use the tired cliché , the benefits of the Fed 's policy have flowed mainly to Wall Street rather than Main Street .
At some point , the central bank will reverse course to normalize policy , perhaps late this year or more likely in 2011 .
That would add up to a tightening in both fiscal and monetary policies next year , which would be analogous to the move to restrictive policies in 1937 .
Then , taxes were increased and the Fed effectively absorbed the excess reserves in the banking system .
The contractionary fiscal and monetary moves of 1937 precipitated the second phase of the Great Depression , all out of misplaced fears of inflation .
History , it 's said , does n't repeat but it rhymes .
While the markets concentrate on the recent history of first - quarter results , they also ought to take note of the ancient history of the ' Thirties .

When it comes to anti-gay bigotry , few individuals have been as influential as Dr. James Dobson , the former head of Focus on the Family .
Autumn Sandeen ( Pam 's House Blend ) has documented the reach of this Christian extremist , illustrating how much damage one hate - filled person can do to an entire community of people .
We knew that Dobson was a prominent defender of hate crimes against members of the GLBT community , and now it appears that he has had a hand in several anti-gay groups .
Dobson has established a notable legacy of hate , all in the name of his god .
The next time I find myself becoming pessimistic about what any one of us can do to change our world , I 'm going to think of Dobson .
If one person can create that much pain and misery for so many , then surely any one of us could do the opposite .
Perhaps Dobson 's legacy of hate can become a motivator of sorts .
Maybe it can drive our efforts to confront bigotry , defend reason , and work to achieve the world we all deserve .
And if you think I 'd find more than a little satisfaction in using Dobson as motivation to undo his " achievements " and correct the damage he 's done , you 'd be right .
Anzac Day is a solemn and special occasion for Aussies and Kiwis ; perhaps even more so for expats who like the Anzacs 103 years ago found themselves on foreign shores , so far away from home .
The Anzac Day Dawn Service in London at Hyde Park Corner is one of the most heavily attended commemorative events held outside of Australia and New Zealand , with thousands of expats coming together to remember the fallen .
In 2018 , the main ceremony will be taking place at the NZ Memorial ( alternating each year with the Australian Memorial ) and be attended by Prince Harry and his fiancée Meghan Markle .
After the Dawn Service is a formal Wreath Laying Ceremony and Parade at the Centotaph in Whitehall followed by a Service of Commemoration and Thanksgiving at Westminster Abbey .
For both of these events , complimentary tickets are required .
If you are in London , get up early and get along to Hyde Park for the Anzac Dawn Service to pay your respects – it will be an emotional experience you wo n’t forget .
On Anzac Day , Wednesday 25 April 2018 , commemorative ceremonies in London are as follows :
____________________________________________

Manque de transparence dans la rémunération des dirigeants , salaires en augmentation malgré des perceptions qui se tassent , frais de représentation mal contrôlés , niveaux de rémunération non justifiés par la difficulté de la tâche , parachutes dorés ... le rapport 2009 qui vient de paraître sur les comptes des sociétés de gestion collective de droits d'auteur et droits voisins est d'une violence inouie sur les rémunérations pratiquées , en particulier à l'encontre de la Sacem .
Mise à jour : pour davantage de détails croustillants , nos lecteurs pourront aussi lire l’article d’Emmanuel Berretta dans Le Point , qui rapporte par exemple que des vacances en Guyane ont été payées avec une carte bancaire de la Sacem .
Les auteurs qui payent pour adhérer à la Sacem apprécieront .
Article du 7 avril 2010 – Chaque année , la cour des comptes publie un rapport établi par la commission permanente de contrôle des sociétés de perception et de répartition des droits , qui passe au crible la gestion des deniers collectés pour les ayants droit par les Sacem , SCPP , SACD , Spedidam et autres sociétés de gestion collective .
Pour la première fois , la cuvée 2009 ( .pdf ) communiquée ce mercredi matin s’est intéressée à la question extrêmement sensible de la rémunération des personnels , et en particulier des cadres qui dirigent ces sociétés d’un genre particulier .
Au moment où le piratage fait l’objet de toutes les inquiétudes quant à son impact sur les revenus des créateurs , chacun s’attend à ce que les dirigeants se serrent la ceinture .
Or le rapport est assassin .
Il note tout d’abord que les charges de gestion des sociétés collectives ont augmenté entre 2006 et 2008 trois fois plus vite que les perceptions .
En 2008 , plus d’un cinquième des revenus collectés ( 21,5 % ) a été utilisé pour financer le fonctionnement - même des sociétés .
Alors que le nombre de salariés a diminué de 2 % sur la période , les charges de personnel ont augmenté de 3,8 % .
« Les dispositions statutaires ou la pratique de certaines sociétés n’associent pas le conseil d’administration à la fixation des rémunérations de leurs principaux dirigeants « , a critiqué ce matin Christian Phéline , rapporteur général de la commission .
Il met en cause la SCPP ( qui collecte les droits affectés aux grandes maisons de disques ) , la Spedidam ( les droits d’une partie des artistes - interprètes ) , et la Procirep ( producteurs de cinéma et de télévision ) .
« Quant à la SACEM , elle ne respecte qu’imparfaitement les dispositions de ses statuts qui confient au conseil d’administration le recrutement et la fixation des rémunérations des cadres supérieurs et prévoient son information sur celle du principal dirigeant « , ajoute M. Phéline .
Dans le rapport , on peut lire que « d’importants progrès resteraient donc à faire du point de vue de la transparence vis -à - vis des associés , sur une question à laquelle les dirigeants intéressés ne manquent pas , quant à eux , d’accorder la plus grande attention « .
Un joli tacle glissé .
Après avoir consulté « 50 situations personnelles « parmi les différentes sociétés de gestion , la commission estime que « les dirigeants de la SACEM connaissent une situation très significativement plus favorable « , et qu’il n’y a pas de rapport entre la rémunération des dirigeants d’une société de gestion et l’importance de ses effectifs ou de ses flux financiers .
En 2008 , la rémunération moyenne des principaux dirigeants des sociétés de gestion collective était de 147 800 euros brut , mais avec de fortes disparités entre chacunes .
A la Sacem , la moyenne des 10 principales rémunérations était de 257 000 euros en 2008 , et les 6 dirigeants en place de 2005 à 2008 ont vu leur rémunération augmenter de 10 % .
Sans dévoiler de rémunération à titre personnel , le rapport donne de précieuses indications .
La SACEM occupe ainsi les deux premières places du classement des 50 plus fortes rémunérations parmi toutes les sociétés de gestion auditées , « avec un écart approchant 55 % entre le dirigeant ainsi placé en seconde position et celui le suivant immédiatement « .
C’est dire si la moyenne de 257 000 euros brut est éloignée de la réalité pour son président du directoire .
Le rapport ajoute qu’en prenant la rémunération la plus élevée dans chacune des huit sociétés de gestion auditées , la plus forte rémunération à la Sacem fait augmenter à elle seule la moyenne de près d’un tiers , à 230 000 euros .
La commission estime par ailleurs que les frais de réception , de déplacement ou de missions des sociétés de gestion « mériteraient souvent d’être mieux formalisés « , ce qui est un langage bien diplomatique pour dire que certaines sociétés de gestion laissent leur dirigeant dépenser sans compter pour leurs restaurants , leurs hôtels et leurs voyages à l’étranger .
« La SACEM n’effectue notamment aucun contrôle systématique des frais de représentation exposés par ses directeurs régionaux « , a regretté ce matin le rapporteur général .
Il fustige aussi les mécanismes d’intéressement mis en place notamment à la Sacem , qui « se fondent sur des facteurs sans rapport direct avec l’efficacité de l’activité des personnels concernés « .
Des parachutes dorés semblent également dans la ligne de mire de la commission , qui note que « le bien - fondé des transactions financières intervenues n’apparaît pas clairement établi dans le cas de certains départs de salariés ou de dirigeants à la SACEM ou à l’ADAMI « .
La commission regrette que « sur la question sensible de la rémunération de l’encadrement supérieur de ces sociétés « , la loi n’impose qu’une « transparence mesurée » par rapport à ce qui est imposé aux sociétés civiles traditionnelles .
En fait , son rapport est même très critique à l’égard des gouvernements successifs qui n’ont pas amélioré la situation , en dépit de déclarations d’intention .
«
La règle aujourd ’hui en vigueur permet toujours à un associé des sociétés de perception et de répartition des droits d’avoir accès qu’au seul » montant global » des cinq ou dix principales rémunérations « , dénonce ainsi le rapport .
« Selon la commission , il resterait en outre à démontrer que certaines des situations observées , notamment à la SACEM , se justifient pleinement au regard du niveau d’activité des organismes concernés , de la réalité des risques encourus par eux ou de la complexité particulière des compétences requises pour ceux qui les dirigent à plus ou moins haut niveau « , a aussi résumé Christian Phéline .
Impitoyable , il ajoute que « quelques rémunérations au moins s’écartent d’ailleurs notablement des normes en vigueur dans les entreprises de taille comparable alors même que celles - ci sont , elles , pleinement exposées à la concurrence « .
Manière de rappeler aux dirigeants des sociétés concernées qu’ils refusent les règles de la concurrence au nom de l’exception culturelle , mais qu’ils s’octroient pourtant des rémunérations ailleurs justifiées par la pression concurrentielle .
Now that a majority of Panthers fans - us included - have subscribed to the mindset that this season is over , playoff - wise , tonight is the perfect time to begin scoreboard watching from a bizarro - world aspect .
As most of us eagerly hope for a juicy lottery spot in the coming weeks , following - and cheering on - the success of clubs near Florida in the standings seems not only natural given what local fans have endured , but logical and self - serving .
" Pride " is a wonderful attribute , but this eroded fanbase has had enough Aprils " played with pride " to fill , well , a decade .
And besides ... we 're not rooting against the Cats ...
Who we 're pulling for tonight ( Panthers currently have 72 points and 0.2 % chance of making the post - season going into this evening 's games ) :
ATL ( 78 points ) at TOR ( 69 Points ) : Game of the night .
No question about this one : it pains me , but Go Leafs Go .
NYR ( 76 p ) at NYI ( 72 p ) : Isles need an OT or SO victory ; in any case , both clubs need the points to " help " us .
TAM ( 72 p ) at COB ( 75 p ) : Das Bolts just gained a gaggle of very temporary Stamkos fans .
Judge Kathleen Cardone ’s postponement , Feb. 18 , of Luis Posada ’s trial in El Paso , Texas , set for March 1 signified for José Pertierra a U.S. ploy to “ put off , defer and delay the case of Luis Posada Carriles until he dies of old age in Miami . ”
Pertierra , who is Venezuela ’s U.S. lawyer , has drawn a blank in trying to get Washington to honor an almost five - year - old request for Posada ’s extradition .
The 82 - year - old Cuban escapee from a Venezuelan jail is needed there so court proceedings against him can be finalized .
Venezuelan prosecutors accuse him of engineering the bombing of a Cuban airliner in 1976 that killed 73 people .
Declassified U.S. intelligence documents confirm his role .
For a while after Posada ’s arrival in the United States in 2005 , the case of the would - be assassin of a head of state , the confessed bomber of tourist hotels in Havana and the murderer of an Italian tourist showed up in alternative press reports but almost never in mainstream media .
He spent a few months in immigration detention and then joined fellow plotter and assassin Orlando Bosch in living the easy life in Miami .
His name shows up in news reports now with less and less frequency .
Trials for Posada were postponed three times before .
One set for May 2007 was cancelled because of prosecutorial errors , viewed as deliberate by some .
Posada earlier faced charges of lying to immigration officials as to how he arrived in Florida .
Charges against him in the recently aborted trial centered on his lying in response to investigators ’ questions about funding and organizing hotel bombings in 1997 .
But over the years , murder , the airliner bombing , and a near assassination of Cuban President Fidel Castro all went by the boards .
Posada gained protection from extradition on the pretext that prosecution on the minor charges took priority .
At the prosecutors ’ behest , access to 90 percent of the evidence against Posada has been sealed , viewable only to the prosecution , defense attorneys and the judge .
Most of the secret material supposedly has to do with Posada ’s CIA career lasting at least 25 years .
Back in 2003 , FBI functionaries in Miami destroyed boxes of evidence against Posada .
Judge Cardone ’s action in calling off the trial came at the prosecution ’s request and was unexplained .
Posada would seem to have the upper hand .
Observers say that his defense will ultimately rely on allegations that the CIA mentored his criminal behavior and even ordered some of his nefarious deeds .
Posada and his lawyers had hinted at piling on embarrassment by divulging CIA crimes he had a hand in or observed .
Old CIA documents released last October by the National Security Archives identified Posada ’s CIA handlers , demonstrated his spying on fellow right - wing Cuban Americans , and recorded a CIA recommendation for a “ responsible civil position ” in post - revolutionary Cuba .
Further contradictions surfaced in plans for Posada ’s flight to El Paso for the trial .
His terrorist past , officially unmentionable , barred him from boarding a commercial flight .
But Judge Kathleen Cardone authorized the bypassing of anti-terrorism rules so Posada could fly in a private jet .
Albert Pardo Herreros , an alleged arms and drug trafficker implicated in the Iran Contra scandal , was to have provided the flight .
The Miami mindset setting Posada up as a hero was on display in a Radio Mambi interview with Posada and his lawyer Arturo Hernandez on Feb. 11 .
They were raising money for Posada ’s legal expenses .
Hernandez proclaimed , “ One great lesson for the community from this trial is the support my client has received .
The trial will be a confrontation of two systems : that of liberty in the United States and Cuban Communism , ” adding that “ the honor of the anti-Castro resistance is what is on trial . ”
At this point , the case against Posada , surrounded by secrecy , is in limbo , which lawyer Pertierra describes as “ the true objective of the prosecution . ”
Judge Cardone announced a hearing for May 20 so that she can “ know the ‘ state ’ of the case , to determine if a date will finally be set for the trial . ”
Washington seems to be playing out a scenario that says , “ Yes , he ’s a terrorist , but he ’s our terrorist . ”

Since it now considered to be highly likely that there is a volcanic eruption under the south western side of the summit of Eyjafjallajökull glacier , the Department of Civil Protection and Emergency Management , has decided to evacuate all areas in the immediate vicinity of the glacier .
People in the area of Fljótshlid , Merkurbæir , Markarfljótsaurar and Landeyjum are instructed to go and register at Red Cross Mass Care centres .
These centres are located in Heimaland , Varmahlid and Drangshlid .
In addition , the Red Cross Mass Care centre has been opened in the elementary school in Hvolsvöllur .
The main road , National route 1 , is now closed from Skeiðavegamót to the west of Skógará .
There 's no doubt that Windows 7 is the most polished operating system Microsoft has released , but that does n't mean there 's no room for improvement .
This collection of free utilities great and small will give you tools to change a significant amount of Windows 7's behavior , from the look of the Start button to hulking out Windows Explorer with FTP powers .
( Credit : Screenshot by Seth Rosenblatt / CNET )
Before we get to gritty fine - tuning apps , let 's start with some of the more - aesthetic ones .
The aforementioned Windows 7 Start Button Changer is a one - hit wonder .
Calling it a " wonder " may be a bit of a stretch , too , but it does allow to users to change and backup the Start button icon without having to dig through dozens of folders and files .
You can install your own custom - made Start button icons , or premade ones .
DeviantArt is a good place to find icons that are free and ready to use .
The app itself is noninvasive and glitz - free , but it could benefit from shorter button names and clearer indications that the buttons are actually buttons .
Small hangups aside , this is an easy way to add a bit more of your personal style to your Windows 7 computer .
Windows
Where addresses one of the minor annoyances of Windows , where program windows often but not always reopen in the same position where you last closed them .
I 've found this most useful when programs or pop -up windows open with the top of their frames hidden under my desktop taskbar , which is an occasional problem because I prefer to run my taskbar at the top of the monitor .
This utility will also run on Windows Vista and XP .
( Credit : Screenshot by Seth Rosenblatt / CNET )
The Windows Themes Installer may seem redundant to some , since Windows 7 comes with generally excellent theme support .
However , this tool allows even better control of how your Windows 7 looks .
It helps by easily installing the necessary theme files into their correct locations , similar to the Start button changer , without having to memorize or write down long file location strings .
Note that there 's no backup option as in the Start button changer , but there is a default theme restore option .
Do n't be afraid to create a system restore before you start mucking about with key Windows files .
Some of the best things about Windows 7 are the window - management tools under the Aero aegis .
Aero Snap , Aero Shake , and Aero Glass do nothing less than make Windows 7 competitive with Apple 's Snow Leopard on the window management front .
The Aero tools pop visually , they 're fun to use , and most importantly , they 're useful .
But that does n't mean you can't tweak them , and for people who want more out of their Aero , there 's AquaSnap .
AquaSnap changes the Snap / Shake / Glass functionality with the entirely new Aqua feature set .
You can also use AquaSnap to toggle at will between Aero and Aqua , or disable them all .
AquaSnap adds quarter - screen sizes to its Aero counterpart .
There 's also a custom option , and it 's multimonitor compatible .
For some odd reason , the Snap features required a reboot before they worked , when the Shake and Peek ones did n't .
( Credit : Screenshot by Seth Rosenblatt / CNET )
AquaShake changes Aero Shake from minimizing all other windows to making them transparent .
Users can toggle the transparency level and the shake sensitivity .
AquaGlass actually does n't change or improve on Aero Glass .
Instead , it makes windows transparent when you drag them around the monitor .
You can adjust the transparency here , too , but this is most useful when you click and hold on a window to quickly see what 's beneath it .
A useful but not killer feature .
During my tests , I found the quarter - screen resizing to be the most useful feature in AquaSnap .
Perhaps the best thing about the app is that it works on legacy Windows systems , thus porting both the default Aero Snap and the expanded Aqua versions to Vista and XP users .
Alt + Tab
Tuner straddles the line between granular control over parts of your system and an aesthetic tweaker .
The app gives you customization power over Windows 7's Alt + Tab preview and window - switching hot - key combo .
That 's pretty much all it does , but it's an incredible depth of fine - tuning .
Users can adjust the margins on the top , bottom , or side of the global preview window ; change the number of columns and rows that those previews appear in ; and change the amount of spacing between each preview thumbnail .
Users can also tweak the program icon location and size ; the preview thumbnail size ; the milliseconds the global preview window takes to fade out ; and the opacity of the previews ' transparency .
( Credit : Screenshot by Seth Rosenblatt / CNET )
The interface is arranged like an equalizer , with slide controls , but each toggle also allows users to type in by hand a precise setting .
Because the utility uses such a familiar design , there 's practically no learning curve except when trying to figure out which slider controls which aspect of the Alt + Tab preview window .
Since most Windows 7 customization utilities tend to ignore the Alt + Tab hot key , Alt + Tab Tuner is a must if you 're looking for precise control over Alt + Tab behavior .
You 'll find Ultimate Windows Tweaker to be a user - friendly optimizing toolbox .
Snappily responsive and designed to look like it's part of the Control Panel , the UWT opens with its central pane showing your system information and its left nav offering tweak categories .
The seven categories include : Personalization , User Account Control , System Performance , Security , Network Tweaks , Internet Explorer , and Additional Tweaks .
Except for the occasional slider , each tweak is based on a check box format for activating options , which users of all levels should find easy to manage and read .
The range of choices looks solid , and there 's something for everybody here , but it does tend to have more beginner 's options than advanced ones .
The basics are covered by tweaks such as restoring the last opened folders in Windows Explorer or disabling Aero Shake .
More advanced options include disabling printer spooling , enabling NTFS self - healing , or limiting bandwidth for the QoS scheduler .
The buttons included with each option category for Create Checkpoint and Restore Defaults should calm any user fears about repairing any accidental damage done .
Where Ultimate Windows
Tweaker may lean ever - so - slightly toward less - confident users , 7 plus goes just slightly in the opposite direction .
It differentiates itself from competitors with a couple of feature surprises and Web links to a series of how - to videos .
There are far too many tweaks to document here , but suffice to say that the drab interface houses five tabs of customizations : two for Windows Explorer , one for non-Explorer tweaks , and the ever - present Miscellaneous tab .
Oh , and the kicker : the FTP tab .
7 plus lets you upload files from Windows Explorer to your FTP site at the touch of a hot key , which is an unusual but very welcome addition .
( Credit : Screenshot by Seth Rosenblatt )
7 plus is mainly built around hot keys , and as such is a keyboard fanatics dream .
You can set hot keys for opening text or image files in an editor of your choosing , opening files , creating new folders , copy folder paths with file names , and append files to the clipboard instead of replacing what 's currently there .
7 plus can create " fast folders , " which are specific folder paths accessible from the center wheel mouse button or the open / save places field .
Outside of Explorer , users get an array of mouse - button and hot - key features , including one - click options for keeping windows on top , toggling wallpaper , or " slide windows " for keeping windows open but off - screen .
There are many more features in the utility , not the least of which is one aimed at XBox players who have a joystick or gamepad connected .
They can use those peripherals to control the mouse when not in full - screen mode .
7 plus's how - to videos are a smart touch , but the interface lacks compared to Ultimate Windows Tweaker .
Also , the hot - key combinations can not be separated from their associated functions , so you can't customize your own preferred keys .
Users should note that while many of the features will work on Windows XP , some are limited to Vista and 7 , and a few will work only on 7 itself .
Bonus app :
If you 're the kind of person who likes at - a - glance weather updates , Weather Bar will add weather updates to your Windows 7 taskbar .
The icon displayed on your taskbar indicates the general weather conditions , while the progress meter indicates the relative humidity .
The app's jump list offers a full four - day prediction including highs , lows , and a predictive icon .

( CNN ) -- Applications for Apple 's iPad can be viewed in the iTunes App Store ahead of the highly anticipated release of the tablet - style computer Saturday .
The batch offers a sneak peek of what 's to come for the iPad and how users will be able to utilize the device , which Apple CEO Steve Jobs unveiled in January .
The iTunes store currently offers more than 2,500 iPad apps , such as Twitterific , AIM and Pandora , many of which will be familiar to iPhone and iPod Touch users .
The available apps cover a wide variety of categories , from entertainment and education to news and sports that , much like apps for other Apple products , range from useful to random .
How will you use the iPad ?
Chatter from the blogosphere took aim at Apple 's apparent change of heart over embargoing all things iPad- related until the device goes on sale Saturday .
" Apple , we hate embargoes too , so we think your undermining them is just great , " a writer for TechCrunch said .
Comments also focused on the cost of the applications , which tend to run higher than those for the iPhone and iTouch .
The Lonely Planet Publications ' " 1,000 Ultimate Experiences " costs $ 19.99 , MLB At Bat is priced at $ 14.99 and the diagramming program OmniGraffle goes for $ 49.99 .
Most prices hover between 99 cents and $ 9.99 for programs such as Thesaurus XL , Hanoi Street Maps , Aki Mahjong , Stickies , Sex Offenders Search and ESPN Pinball .
Familiar apps such as USA Today , AP and NPR are still free , so are apps for Netflix , eBay , and Yellow Pages , to name a few .
The iPad works with most of the 150,000 apps in the App Store , Apple says on its site .
" If you already have apps for your iPhone or iPod Touch , just sync them to iPad from your Mac or PC .
They run in their original size or you can expand them to fill the iPad screen , " the site says .
The product 's unveiling in January was met with a mix of skepticism and fanfare from tech observers and Apple devotees , who have been waiting years for the next generation of Apple devices .
The half - inch thick , 1.5 - lb. computer has a 1 GHz processor and is available in 16 - gigabyte , 32 - gigabyte and 64 - gigabyte versions , Jobs said in January .
Pricing will start at $ 499 for the 16 - gigabyte version , $ 599 for the 32 - gig version and $ 699 for the 64 , he said .
It goes on sale at 9 a.m. Saturday .

With the prospect of yet another Israeli invasion of southern Lebanon looming large , Parliamentary Speaker Nabih Berri warns that the nation is in a defensive posture , and called for international help for new peace talks .
The call was reportedly rebuffed by the United States , however , as Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is said to have dispatched a message to Berri warning that the United States could do nothing to stop a potential Israeli invasion , citing reports of arms smuggling to Hezbollah , whose political wing is now part of the Lebanese government .
In late January , Israeli Minister Yossi Peled declared that a new war against Lebanon was only a matter of time .
The threat has solidified Lebanon ’s tenuous coalition government , and Hezbollah and the Lebanese military are scrambling to prepare for the invasion .
The refusal of help from the Obama Administration is likely to be particularly galling , however , after officials played such an overt role in swinging the narrow June election in favor of a pro-US Sunni faction .
America ’s pledge of “ aid ” for Lebanon in returning for supporting that faction , it seems , wo n’t involve any effort to prevent the US - armed Israeli military from launching its second invasion of the nation in less than four years .

Mexico City , Mexico ( CNN ) --
Mexican authorities have suspended their investigation into the disappearance of a former presidential candidate after his family asked authorities to stand back from the case , the attorney general 's office announced Saturday .
Diego Fernandez de Cevallos , 69 , a former senator and close ally of Mexican President Felipe Calderon , disappeared a week ago near his ranch in the state of Queretaro in central Mexico .
Blood and other signs of a struggle were found inside , police said .
Federal prosecutors had been investigating the case but said in a statement Saturday that they had called it off at the request of the ex-senator 's family members .
In a letter Friday , the ex-senator 's son , Diego Fernandez de Cevallos Gutierrez , thanked authorities for their " diligence and commitment " in the investigation , but asked that they " remain in the margins " of the negotiation process to guarantee the life and safety of his father .
At a speech before a National Action Party convention Saturday , Calderon sent a message of support to the former senator and his family .
He also recalled the first time they met .
" I saw him smoking a cigar , reading the newspaper and driving his truck all at the same time , " Calderon said , according to information posted on the party 's Web site .
Fernandez de Cevallos was a presidential candidate in 1994 and has served as a Mexican senator and congressman .
He belongs to the same political party as Calderon , leading some officials to speculate that he may have been abducted by narcotraffickers .
More than 22,700 people have been killed since Calderon declared war on the drug cartels shortly after taking office in December 2006 .
Fernandez de Cevallos ' conservative politics also have led others to speculate that leftist guerrillas may have abducted him .
But the guerrilla Popular Revolutionary Army issued a statement Monday saying it did not have anything to do with the disappearance .
A photo showing a blindfolded man resembling Fernandez de Cevallos was e-mailed this week to the media but has not been authenticated .
On Monday , the senator 's family issued a plea asking the abductors to negotiate with them for his release .
Part of the Series The Public Intellectual
This article is the first of a three - part series taken from a forthcoming book , Education and the Crisis of Public Values to be published by Peter Lang Publishing Group .
As the Obama administration ’s educational reform movement increasingly adopts the interests and values of a “ free - market ” culture , many students graduate public schooling and higher education with an impoverished political imagination , unable to recognize injustice and unfairness .
They often find themselves invested in a notion of unattached individualism that severs them from any sense of moral and social responsibility to others or to a larger notion of the common good .
At the same time , those students who jeopardize the achievement of the quantifiable measures and instrumental values now used to define school success are often subjected to harsh disciplinary procedures , pushed out of schools , subjected to medical interventions or , even worse , pushed into the criminal justice system .
[ 1 ]
Most of these students are poor whites and minorities of color and , increasingly , students with special needs .
To be sure , the empirical emphasis of conservative school policy has been in place for decades .
In keeping with this trend , the Obama administration ’s educational policy under the leadership of Arne Duncan lacks a democratic vision and sense of moral direction .
Consequently , it reproduces rather than diminishes many of these problems .
In addition , these policies bear the trace of the ideological remnants of a second Gilded Age that repudiated civic education and schooling as a public good .
Rather than arguing for educational reforms and a value shift away from the ethically deadening demands of an egocentric , consumerist society that can only respond to the lure of goods , profits and “ rational investments , ” Obama and Duncan are pushing the same pernicious set of values that redefine citizens as stockholders , customers and clients .
Similarly , they have pushed for modes of teaching and learning that promote a formative culture that in effect produces and legitimates a culture of illiteracy and moral indifference that too closely correlates with what journalist Matt Taibbi rightly calls a “ world of greed without limits . ” [ 2 ]
Instead of promoting or extending “ education ’s democratizing influence on the nation ” [ 3 ] as part of one needed response to the corruption that led to the global recession , Duncan has fervently placed American society under the sway of an educational reform movement that is at odds with a vision of schooling dedicated to the cultivation of an informed , critical citizenry capable of actively participating and governing in a democratic society .
In fact , Duncan ’s understanding of school reform is contrary to forms of knowledge and pedagogy that enable rather than subvert the potential of a socially just and sustainable society .
Almost all of Duncan ’s polices are indebted to the codes of a market - driven business culture , legitimated through discourses of measurement , efficiency and utility .
This is a discourse that values hedge fund managers over teachers , privatization over the public good , management over leadership and training over education .
Duncan ’s fervent support of neoliberal values are well - known and are evident in his support for high - stakes testing , charter schools , school - business alliances , merit pay , linking teacher pay to higher test scores , offering students monetary rewards for higher grades , CEO - type management , abolishing tenure , defining the purpose of schooling as largely job training , the weakening of teacher unions and blaming teachers exclusively for the failure of public schooling . [ 4 ]
His support of the firing of the entire faculty of a Central Falls High School in Rhode Island is indicative of his disdain for public school teachers and teacher unions .
Although teachers and administrators have to accept responsibility for the academic performance of their students , there are often many other factors that have to be taken into consideration such as a parent ’s involvement , the socio- economic status of the students , the existence of support services for students and the challenges that emerge when students do not speak English as a first language .
Many of the Central Falls students did not speak English well , came from families that were poor , worked after school and had few support services and specialists at their disposal .

Obama and Duncan ignored all of these factors because they have little sense of the larger socio- economic forces that bear down on schools , putting many students at a decided disadvantage when compared to their well - resourced , middle - class counterparts .
Duncan has expanded the reach of his educational reform policies and is now attempting to rewrite curricular mandates .
Emphasizing the practical and experiential , he seeks to gut the critical nature of theory , pedagogy and knowledge taught in colleges of education .
This is an important issue to more than just teachers who are denied a voice in curricular development ; it also affects whole generations of youth .
Such a bold initiative reveals in very clear terms the political project that drives his reforms and what he fears about both public schooling and the teachers who labor in classrooms every day .
Within the last year , Duncan has delivered a number of speeches in which he has both attacked colleges of education and called for alternative routes to teacher certification .
[ 6 ]
According to Duncan , the great sin these colleges have committed in the past few decades is that they have focused too much on theory and not enough on clinical practice ; and by theory he means critical pedagogy , or those theories that enable prospective teachers to situate school knowledges , practices and modes of governance within wider critical , historical , social , cultural , economic and political contexts .
Duncan wants such colleges to focus on practical methods in order to prepare teachers for an outcome - based education system , which is code for pedagogical methods that are as anti-intellectual as they are politically conservative .
This is a pedagogy useful for creating armies of number crunchers , reduced to supervising the administration of standardized tests , but not much more .
Reducing pedagogy to the teaching of methods and data - driven performance indicators that allegedly measures scholastic ability and improve student achievement is nothing short of scandalous .
Rather than provide the best means for confronting “ difficult truths about the inequality of America ’s political economy , ” such a pedagogy produces the swindle of “ blaming inequalities on individuals and groups with low test scores . ” [ 7 ]
This is a pedagogy that sabotages any attempt at self - reflection and quality education , all the while providing an excuse for producing moral comas and a flight from responsibility .
By espousing empirically based standards as a fix for educational problems , advocates of these measures do more than oversimplify complex issues , they also remove the classroom from larger social , political and economic forces and offer up anti-intellectual and ethically debased technical and punitive solutions to school and classroom problems .
In addition , Duncan ’s insistence on banishing theory from teacher education programs in favor of promoting narrowly defined skills and practices foreshadows the preparation of teachers as a subaltern class who believe that the purpose of education is only to train students to compete successfully in a global economy .
This model of teaching being celebrated here is one in which teachers are constructed as clerks and technicians who have no need for a public vision in which to imagine the democratic role and social responsibility that schools , teachers or pedagogy might assume for the world and future they offer to young people .
Drew Gilpin Faust , the current president of Harvard University , is right in insisting , “ But even as we as a nation have embraced education as critical to economic growth and opportunity , we should remember that [ public schools ] , colleges and universities are about a great deal more than measurable utility .
Unlike perhaps any other institutions in the world , they embrace the long view and nurture the kind of critical perspectives that look far beyond the present . ” [ 8 ]
Duncan argues that most of the nation ’s 1,450 colleges of education and programs are doing an inadequate job , as reflected in the fact that nearly 30 percent of students drop out or fail to graduate on time .
His defense of alternative routes to education comes from what he calls the looming shortage of teachers that will take place in the near future as an older generation of teachers retire .
The first argument strikes me as a non sequitur .
Surely , there are multiple factors that cause students to drop out .
Some of them are mundane – a change of career path – and some are more tragic – a lack of funds to continue .
But many are rooted in the overwhelming recognition of the larger social forces that undermine the mission of education from the massive inequalities in school funding , racism , dire rates of poverty , spiraling youth unemployment , dismantling of important social services and the escalating governing through crime complex that increasingly criminalizes of all aspects of youth behavior . [ 9 ]
Moreover , any discourse that situates teaching within a critical understanding of these forces is precisely what Duncan wants to remove from the curriculum .
In his defense for reforming teacher education programs , he offers the following :
In my seven years as CEO of the Chicago Public Schools and in my current job as I ’ve traveled the country , I ’ve had hundreds of conversations with great young teachers … .
In particular they say two things about their training in ed school .
First , most of them say they did not get the hands - on practical teacher training about managing the classroom that they needed , especially for high - needs students .
And second , they say there were not taught how to use data to differentiate and improve instruction and boost student learning . [ 10 ]
Duncan then goes on to praise Louisiana as a model for building longitudinal data systems that track the impact of new teachers on student achievement .
For Duncan , Louisiana represents a beacon for how schools should be redefined , largely as sites of management and data collection , and advances the notion that teachers should be trained to operate proficiently in such sites .
Ironically , or perhaps tragically , what Duncan leaves out of his praise for the Louisiana school system is the fact that it has one of the highest rates of student suspensions and expulsions in the nation .
As the report , Pushed Out , indicated :
Louisiana ’s expulsion rate is five times the national rate , nearly 16,000 middle and high school students drop out each year and public schools in the state dole out over 300,000 out - of - school suspensions a year .
Within the state - run Recovery School District direct operated schools , the expulsion rate is ten times the national rate and 1 in every 4 students was suspended in a single year , twice the statewide rate and over four times the national rate .
State law , as currently written , contributes to the problem , allowing principals to suspend students for a wide range of minor misbehavior , including “ willful disobedience , ” disrespecting school staff and using “ unchaste or profane language . ”
Moreover , the overuse of harsh discipline disproportionately affects some Louisiana school children over others .
African American students make up 44 % of the statewide public school population , but 68 % of suspensions and 72.5 % of expulsions .
And in school districts with a larger percentage of African American and low - income students , there are higher rates of suspension and expulsion .
These districts tend to have fewer resources for positive interventions . [ 11 ]
Duncan ’s collusion with the growing corporatization and militarizing of public schools , along with the increased use of harsh disciplinary modes of punishment , surveillance , control and containment , especially in schools inhabited largely by poor minorities of color , reveals his unwillingness to address the degree to which many schools are dominated by a politics of fear , containment and authoritarianism , even as he advances reform as a civil rights issue . [ 12 ]
Schools are not merely places where potential workers learn the marketable skills and abilities necessary to secure a decent job , they are also , as Martha C. Nussbaum pointed out , key institutions of the public good and are “ crucial to both the health of democracy and to the creation of a decent world culture and a robust type of global citizenship . ” [ 13 ]
Curriculum in this instance is not simply knowledge to be consumed or valued for its measurable utility , it should be rooted in the best that has been produced by human beings and designed to both stir the imagination and empower young people with a sense of integrity , justice and hope for the future .
As the former president of Brown University , Vartan Gregorian , insisted , “ [ W ] cannot have a democracy without its foundation being knowledge … .
And knowledge does not mean only technical knowledge .
But also you need to have knowledge of our society , knowledge of the world ….
we should know about the rest of the world . ” [ 14 ]
When educational reform neglects matters of politics , critical thinking , creativity and the power of the imagination , it loses its hold on preparing young people for a democratic future and condemns them to a world where the only values that matter are individual acquisition , unchecked materialism , economic growth and a winner - take - all mentality .
The diverse range of political , economic , racial and social forces that influence all aspects of schooling need to be critically engaged and rearticulated in the interest of justice , human development , freedom and equal opportunity .
These are not merely political issues , they are also pedagogical concerns and the former cannot be separated from the latter , just as equity cannot be separated from matters of excellence .
Defining schools exclusively in terms of mathematical coordinates and statistical formulas suggests that Duncan has no language for addressing schools as sites or teachers as engaged intellectuals that mediate , accommodate , reproduce and sometimes challenge the diverse and often anti-democratic forces that bear down on them .
If schools are increasingly being governed through a culture modeled after prisons as I have suggested in “ Youth in a Suspect Society , ” how does one understand the growth of this model of schooling and what might it tell us about the transformation of the state and the expansion of the criminal justice system into more and more aspects of everyday life , extending from the classroom to the welfare system ?
What does it mean to ignore the increasing corporatization , privatization and militarization of schools at a time when all aspects of public life are under siege by corporate and market - driven forces ?
How can schools fulfill their democratic mission when they are shaped by a social order characterized by massive inequalities in wealth and power ?
The methodology madness paradigm considers these dangerous questions , just as it believes that the theories and pedagogical practices that make such questions possible off limits to colleges and programs of education .
Surely , under such circumstances , we have joined Alice in falling into the rabbit hole .
These are not questions Duncan seems remotely interested in addressing , primarily because his obsession with instrumental values holds both public schools and public values in contempt .
Surely , prospective teachers should have some idea , some sort of theoretical model , if not also diverse vocabularies and varied paradigms in order to understand the social forces that currently impact students , schools , the policy environment surrounding schools and teaching itself , which often take place in contexts that vastly differ according to a range of social and economic determinants .
Duncan ’s attack on theory and critical thinking is not only rooted in the most perverse form of anti-intellectualism ; it is also in lockstep with a conservative and corporate educational reform movement driven by an ideological agenda largely shaped by a number of anti-public conservative foundations , politicians , legislators and intellectuals who argue for deregulation and exhibit a strange obsession with crunching numbers .
Ironically , this argument comes at a time when deregulation and ethical dishonesty are largely seen as some of the reasons behind the massive economic meltdown .
One of the most prominent of these anti-public intellectuals is David M. Steiner , the commissioner of New York State Department of Education , whose work is often praised by Duncan .
Steiner is a firm exponent of charter schools , [ 15 ] alternative routes to teacher certification and data - driven approaches to teaching .
He has argued repeatedly against theoretical course work and is a strong advocate of “ more on - the - job training . ”
But Steiner is not simply a retrograde positivist touting the virtues of instrumental rationality , he is also a die - hard conservative ideologue who is intent on eliminating the conditions that might result in prospective teachers being exposed to critical , if not progressive , theory and literature about schooling , pedagogy and broader social issues .
In fact , Steiner appears to be repelled by any notion of theory that might reveal the ideological , pedagogical and political limitations of stir - and - serve recipes for teaching .
He has made a number of public comments that suggest he is horrified by the notion that practice , indirectly or directly , might be informed by theory and engaged as a serious issue by existing and prospective teachers .
In this case , his fear of theory may stem from its ability to raise critical questions about the forms of authority , specific ideologies , values and interests that structure pedagogical practices .
This might explain his emphasis on teaching prospective teachers a range of banal techniques such as “ when to make eye contact , when to call on a student by name , when to wait for a fuller answer . ” [ 16 ]
Pedagogy in this view is utterly depoliticized , while the ideological nature of the production of knowledge , identities , desires and social relations within the classroom gets conveniently buried beneath an appeal to techniques and methods .
What also gets conveniently buried is the productive character of pedagogy as a moral and political practice .
What Steiner misses in his dystopian and regressive support for methods removed from theoretical , historical , ethical and political considerations is that the issue of pitting theory against practice is a false one since theoretical questions always guide any form of classroom practice .
What is lost here is that the issue is not whether schools of education produce too much theory , but as Stuart Hall pointed out , we simply “ ca n’t do without it . ”
Theory is crucial because it enables us “ to change the scale of magnification …. to break into the confusing fabric that ‘ the real ’ apparently presents and find another way in .
So it ’s like a microscope and until you look at the evidence through the microscope , you ca n’t see the hidden relations . ” [ 17 ]
Practices , techniques and methodologies do not speak for themselves and they are meaningless unless they are subject to critical interrogation and examined both through specific theoretical frameworks and the theoretical values they attempt to legitimate , particularly when used to support dominant modes of authority , teaching and learning .
The presupposition that practice is not bound to submit to norms or is unmediated by theoretical paradigms is as anti-intellectual as it is depoliticizing .
The real issue is whether teachers are aware of and reflective about the theoretical frameworks and norms that inform their work .
At the very least , being attentive to matters of theory enables them to better understand the ethical values , ideologies and political visions that inform different forms of practice .
Surely , Steiner is too smart to accept the preposterous notion that theory is more of a pathology and a threat than an invaluable resource .
It is hard to imagine him faulting the role that theory might play in enabling teachers to be thoughtful about the social , cultural , psychological and political forces that shape classroom knowledge and produce hidden structures of meaning beneath officially sanctioned narratives .
It is also hard to accept his belief that it is impossible for theory to provide teachers with possibilities for not only differentiating among diverse forms of classroom practice , but also for producing new forms of practice .
Theory is the condition that enables teachers and students to be self - reflexive , develop better forms of knowledge and classroom skills and gain an understanding of the contexts in which they teach and learn , which have already been constructed through struggles over theories that make a claim to legitimating what kind of knowledge and practice count in a classroom .
Theory creates the possibilities for being reflective about meaning and its effects ; and it ’s a powerful tool for understanding how to interrogate those pedagogical spaces in which identities , values and social relations are in play within diverse situations of power .
Steiner ’s rejection of theory as a rather useless abstraction is really an attack on the productive nature of pedagogy itself and with equipping teachers with the skills they need to be critical , autonomous agents in the classroom .
It is precisely this rejection of theory that prevents teachers from addressing the right - wing policies now being enacted in Texas and Arizona , which are as morally repugnant as they are intellectually comatose . [ 18 ]
At the same time , this anti-theory retreat into the world of methods and instrumental rationality is more than a retreat from the world in all of its political and social complexity – it is likewise a move away from any understanding of the public school as a bastion of democratic learning and civic pedagogy , just as it is a retreat from any measure of moral and social responsibility .
This is a dangerous and difficult stance to take at a time when the country is besieged by massive corruption , a lack of political vision and a moral void that promote bigotry , massive exploitation and a dangerous national chauvinism .
What needs to be emphasized against this instrumental view of teacher education is that there is much more at work here than a disagreement over the relationship between theory and practice .
There is also an ideologically driven disavowal of critical pedagogy , the civic meaning of schooling and the role that teachers might play in connecting learning to matters of politics , power and democracy .
In fact , Steiner ’s position became crystal clear to me when I attended the Nexus Conference in Amsterdam in 2007 .
Steiner was on a panel and he raised a number of issues about schooling that were deeply conservative , if not reactionary .
When I asked him about the role of schooling as a public good , as an institution that should be defined in more capacious terms than a paradigm that focuses on simply collecting data , he answered by saying , “ Social justice promotes hatred .
Hatred for the established order . ”
I was both surprised and distressed by this response , as were a number of other people in the conference .
Steiner ’s response revealed a buried order of conservative politics that lies beneath his rhetoric about practice while , at the same time , offering insight about what it is about Steiner ’s policies as a model for educational reform throughout the country that attracts Arne Duncan ’s spirited support .
I can only assume that the object of Steiner ’s critique of social justice programs is critical thought itself , which is labeled by its detractors as a form of negativism , while those who deploy critiques of the status quo are stereotyped as cynical , resentful and un-American .
While it would be unfair to compare Steiner with Tom Horne , the xenophobic Arizona superintendent of public schools , he has used the same argument against thoughtful critique , labeling it as a downer and unworthy of having a place in the public schools , particularly when it takes the form of ethnic studies programs . [ 19 ]
Not only is such an argument at odds with an open democratic society , it is fundamentally part of a authoritarian model of pedagogy that ultimately seeks to erase any notion of history considered at odds with official narratives .
Duncan and Steiner reify pedagogy by stripping it of its political and ethical referents and transforming it into a grab bag of practical methods and techniques .
Neither of them can theorize the productive character of pedagogy as a political and moral discourse .
Hence , both are silent about the institutional conditions that bear down on the ability of teachers to link conception with execution and what it means to develop a better understanding of pedagogy as a struggle over the shaping of particular identities .
Nor can they raise questions about education as a form of political intervention that offers the conditions for teachers to create potentially empowering or disempowering spaces for students , critically interrogate the role of teacher authority or engage the limits of established academic subjects in sustaining critical dialogues about educational aims and practices .
These questions barely scratch the surface of issues that are often excluded when education is linked solely to the teaching of content and pedagogy is instrumentalized to the point of irrelevance .
Pedagogy is never innocent .
But if it is to be understood and made problematic as a moral and political practice , educators must not only critically question and register their own subjective involvement in how and what they teach , they must also resist calls to transform pedagogy into the mere application of standardized practical methods and techniques .
Otherwise , teachers become indifferent to the ethical and political dimensions of their own authority and practice .
There is no escaping the detour through theory that every pedagogical practice must take , just as it is impossible to suggest that schools are somehow neutral institutions that can ignore the ways in which social , ethical and political norms bear down on almost every aspect of schooling and classroom teaching .
In fact , one can reasonably argue that most of what is learned in schools takes place through a hidden curriculum in which particular forms of knowledge , culture , values and desires are taught , but never talked about or made public .
One only has to mention as a case in point the ways in which schools increasingly function as part of a circuit of power that produces the school - to - prison pipeline .
One would be hard pressed to find any educator who claims that his or her school participates in such a vicious process and , yet , the hard realities of such practices bear down on poor minority children everyday as part of the hidden curriculum of schooling . [ 20 ]
Missing from Duncan and Steiner ’s celebration of data driven teaching is any concern about the complex and often contradictory role that schools play in either extending or closing down the possibilities for students to participate within a wider democratic culture .
Nor is there any interest in exploring how power works through particular texts , social practices and institutional structures to produce differences organized around complex forms of subordination and empowerment .
Given these omissions , it is not surprising that little is said about how the dominant culture of schooling legitimates as well as excludes , under vastly different conditions of learning , those students who are marginalized by class and race .
Nor is much said about what ideological and institutional conditions are necessary to provide teachers with the opportunities they need to function as critical public intellectuals rather than as robotic data retrievers .
Duncan and Steiner seem mute on the issue of what it means to turn their empirically - based views of classroom practice into an exploration of the limits of such practice and empirically - based knowledge itself .
Of course , practice on its own tells us nothing , because it is always subject to various theoretical , historical and social categories through which it is framed and experienced .
Educational practice gets its meaning not simply by being emulated , but by how it is reflected upon , critically mediated and thoughtfully engaged , just like any other body of knowledge .
I think that Duncan and Steiner ’s hostility to theory and critical pedagogy is less about their presence in various educational programs and schools of education than it is about the potential of certain types of theory and pedagogical practices to raise questions at odds with their right - wing support for the corporate elite ’s version of school reform .
How else to explain Steiner ’s ludicrous statements reported in The New York Times that “ colleges of education still devote too much class time to abstract notions about [ what he calls ] ‘ the role of school in democracy ’ and ‘ the view by some that schools exist to perpetuate a social hierarchy ' ” ? [ 21 ]
Steiner ’s disdain for having future teachers analyze the role of schools and pedagogy itself through larger political , social and economic categories is palpable .
Steiner ’s fear of teachers and students viewing public and higher education as crucial forces for creating critical citizens and viable spheres for learning about and defending democratic values , identities and social relations says a great deal about his own politics and disdain for public values .
Of course , Steiner became the golden boy for the neoconservative movement after publishing an article in 2005 in which he analyzed the syllabi in foundations courses from 16 elite schools of education and concluded that , since there was a disproportionate number of progressive authors being read in those courses , these education programs must be dominated by left - leaning ideologies . [ 22 ]
Needless to say , this type of ideologically - based research begins with a premise and then looks for the evidence to support it .
Not only is there a long history of left professors being wrongfully denied tenure in such schools , myself included , but the departments that often dominate these schools such as the departments of educational administration , leadership , policy and psychology are often the most powerful and conservative within colleges and schools of education .
As is well known , schools of education are among the most conservative and deeply anti-intellectual colleges on campuses ; they are , in many cases , already concerned with teaching methods , and for this they are certainly deserving of criticism .
Unfortunately , Steiner ignores the current situation , and in the name of reform , simply amplifies these problems .
Moreover , course syllabi tell us nothing about how books are interpreted by either professors or students .
Steiner ’s own claims to being impartial are as bogus as is his research .
Missing from Steiner ’s views on education are crucial questions regarding what matters beyond learning methods , taking tests , using data and celebrating technocratic modes of rationality .
What kind of education do we need for young people to become informed citizens capable of learning how to govern rather than simply be governed ?
What kind of education do we need to create a generation of young people willing to engage , defend and struggle for the ideals and social relations that offer the promise of social justice and substantive democracy ?
Given the crucial importance of public school teachers in providing students with the knowledge and imagination they will need to further the ideals , social relations and institutions crucial to an aspiring democracy , the Obama - Duncan view of educational reform must be steadfastly rejected .
Many teachers , students , workers , and many others feel an acute sense of betrayal and moral indignation as the social state is dismantled , the moral compact dissolved , politicians scramble to protect the privileged , wealthy and mega corporations are provided with massive bailouts , while the burden for the current economic recession is placed on the working and middle classes .
The formative educational culture necessary for creating both critical citizens and a robust democracy is under major attack in the United States .
And this is most evident in the assault that Duncan is waging against public schools , teachers and colleges of education .
The Obama administration ’s educational policy appears to favor an education system and a broader cultural apparatus that are utterly commodified , instrumentalized and dominated by private rather than public considerations .
Curiously , despite some skepticism regarding market - driven values being expressed by those involved in the financial sector in the United States , debates over education seem to be one of the few places left where neoliberal values are asserting themselves in an entirely unreflective way .
The strict emphasis on individual competition , private goods and unbridled self - interest now finds its counterpart in the disparagement of any pedagogy that encourages criticism , critical dialogue and thoughtful exchange .
The latter are core elements of any viable classroom pedagogy and any call to either eliminate such practices from schools or to subordinate them to a sterile form of instrumental rationality serves the interests of a closed and authoritarian social order rather than an open and democratic society . [ 23 ]
The pedagogical conditions necessary to reclaim a formative culture of political literacy suggest that we take matters of education seriously if we are going to survive as a democracy .
At the very least , it is time for Americans to take note of the fundamental importance of retaining educational theories and pedagogical practices that produce the knowledge , values and formative culture necessary for young people to believe that democracy is worth fighting for .

There is no credible evidence supporting the idea that paying teachers whose students score high on standardized tests makes them better teachers .
In fact , given the various scandals that have emerged in Texas and other places regarding teachers who provide fake tests scores or who alter the results of such scores , it would seem that what these schemes really do is promote corruption .

The liberal version of this type of argument can be found in Stanley Fish , “ Arizona : The Gift that Keeps on Going , ” New York Times ( May 17 , 2010 ) .
Online here .
Fish is repulsed by the idea that the classroom could possibly be shot through with politics and power and assumes that any suggestion of the sort or any pedagogy that describes itself as a moral and political practice is by default a form of indoctrination .
What Fish repeatedly misses in his confused understanding of the project of critical pedagogy is that education is always a deliberate attempt to shape the knowledge , values , capacities and identities of students .
And rather than being reduced to a form of didacticism that errs on the side of indoctrination , one defining feature of its project is to reject any form of pedagogy that is unaware of the politics and values that guides its theory , practice and mode of socialization .
To acknowledge the presence of such a project and the mechanisms of power is not the same as using pedagogy to indoctrinate students .
On the contrary , the issue of how such forces operates in the curriculum and classroom should be treated as a theoretical resource that prevents such forces from being translated into a form of pedagogical terrorism , one that silences students and undermines any vestige of critical learning .
How can pedagogy free itself of the pressures of the politics , policy , economics , inequality , and other forces shaping the larger social world ?
Needless to say , pedagogy is always political by virtue of the ways in which power is used to shape various elements of classroom identities , desires , values and social relations , but that is different from being an act of indoctrination .
Fish ’s notion of depoliticization is so totalizing that it is incapable of making such distinctions or even recognizing that he uses his column as a pulpit and his mass - media power to advance his own political views on the virtues of depoliticization , whether in the classroom or in the larger public sphere .
He is so confused about the meaning and role of critical pedagogy that he actually argues in a New York Times op - ed that Tom Horne , the racist and ignorant superintendent of schools in Tucson , Arizona , simply offers the right - wing counterpart to Paulo Freire ’s notion of critical pedagogy .
Apparently , what they share is that they both politicize the classroom .
This is more than a theoretical stretch ; it is simply a display of pure ignorance .
Moreover , it is a mode of argument that replicates the type of reasoning often used by right - wing Tea Party extremists .

Today 's release of the National Broadband Network ( NBN ) report suggests that the NBN will cost taxpayers $ 5 billion less than the initial $ 43 billion and will be affordable for consumers with or without Telstra 's participation .
This is good news for Australia .
But the way Communications Minister Stephen Conroy is handling one of the most important events in 21st century nation - building is an absolute disgrace .
The long awaited report by KPMG and McKinsey was released at 1:30 pm today after a budget - style lock - up of selected journalists .
And this is where the problem with Conroy begins .
The NBN has the potential to put the " public " back into public policy - making .
But with the current minister at the helm , all we seem to be getting is a one - size - fits - all solution dictated by policy - making elites .
Australia has one of the most modern democratic political systems in the world , yet citizen participation in policy processes is effectively blocked by elitist attitudes .
Indeed , public consultation usually results in little more than a placebo to calm the masses rather than a deliberate attempt to understand what issues are actually in the " public interest " .
The bill for neglecting Australia 's communications infrastructure has finally arrived and while it is significantly cheaper , the sneaky manner in which publicly - funded reports are delivered by government is nothing short of tyranny .
To make matters worse , the government is delivering mixed messages .
In response to the Government 2.0 Taskforce report recently , the government is suggesting that the use of new communications technologies ( which will be enabled by the NBN ) will " shift public sector culture and practice to make government information more accessible and usable [ and ] make government more consultative , participatory and transparent " .
It would seem that somebody forgot to tell Stephen Conroy .
The minister is doing everything possible to sabotage public involvement in the NBN 's implementation .
Today 's cloak and dagger style meeting of Canberra 's press elite is just an extension of what we have come to expect from a minister who wants to implement an Internet filter to censor what Australians can access on the Net before the NBN is even available .
But none of this is necessary .
Any number of people involved in delivering services such as health and education know just how important access to the NBN will be in improving the efficiency and effectiveness of service delivery .
But even the problems in these two areas are not being addressed by innovative practice or new ideas - giving more and more responsibility to the federal government is all the elites have been able to come up with so far .
Maybe it is time someone else had a go .
Those educating young Australians know just how desperately Australia needs the NBN .
In comparison to their counterparts in the UK , Canada and the US , Australian students are not only behind in accessing affordable and adequate communications services , but their involvement in creating , disseminating and accessing public goods such as open education and other information resources is about a decade behind .
So much for the education revolution and preparing for the knowledge economy .
Further , education now ranks in the top five Australian export industries .
In a country where the standard of living rests on major exports of unsustainable resources such as coal , the education industry provides the biggest opportunity for sustainable future prosperity .
But without the NBN , our chances of continuing to grow our exports in this industry are effectively hamstrung .
While today 's government - funded report is nothing more than an expert opinion to back up the government 's NBN proposal , the price tag and the expected increase in access to the infrastructure will provide welcome relief for the government .
And few would doubt the report has been held back for so long for any reason other than political opportunism .
With Opposition Leader Tony Abbott speculating recently that the Coalition could deliver the NBN faster and cheaper , Conroy will be able to take a breath while the details of the 500 page report are being absorbed .
But do n't be fooled into thinking that things will be better under a Coalition government .
After all , Conroy says the Coalition were responsible for keeping Australia 's communications infrastructure in the dark ages .
And this is one area where Conroy is actually right .
Abbott and the Coalition will no doubt cut spending on the NBN or scrap the project altogether , and this would be tantamount to deliberately making Australia part of the developing world .
Prime Minister Kevin Rudd is well aware of the consequences of failure with the NBN , stating that he does n't " intend to be Prime Minister of Australia which consigns our 21st Century to a 20th Century technology " .
But none of this bodes well for the whole point of having the NBN - to enable citizens to have greater access to information and communication services .
